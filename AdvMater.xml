         <title>Atomic&#8208;Scale Tracking Topological Phase Transition Dynamics of Polar Vortex&#8208;Antivortex Pairs</title>

Abstract
Non&#8208;trivial topological structures, such as vortex&#8208;antivortex (V&#8208;AV) pairs, have garnered significant attention in the field of condensed matter physics. However, the detailed topological phase transition dynamics of V&#8208;AV pairs, encompassing behaviors like self&#8208;annihilation, motion, and dissociation, have remained elusive in real space. Here, we employ polar V&#8208;AV pairs as a model system and track their transition pathways with atomic&#8208;scale resolution, facilitated by in situ (scanning) transmission electron microscopy and phase field simulations. Our investigation reveals that polar vortices and antivortices can stably coexist as bound pairs at room temperature, and their polarization decreases with heating. No dissociation behavior is observed between the V&#8208;AV phase at room temperature and the paraelectric phase at high temperature. However, the application of electric fields can promote the approach of vortex and antivortex cores, ultimately leading to their annihilation near the interface. Revealing the transition process mediated by polar V&#8208;AV pairs at the atomic scale, particularly the role of polar antivortex, provides us new insights into understanding the topological phases of matter and their topological phase transitions. Moreover, the detailed exploration of the dynamics of polar V&#8208;AV pairs under thermal and electrical fields lays a solid foundation for their potential applications in electronic devices.

         <title>Activating Iterative Revolutions of the Cancer&#8208;Immunity Cycle in Hypoxic Tumors with a Smart Nano&#8208;Regulator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The activation of sequential events in the cancer&#8208;immunity cycle (CIC) is crucial for achieving effective anti&#8208;tumor immunity. However, formidable challenges, such as innate and adaptive immune resistance, along with the off&#8208;target adverse effects of non&#8208;selective immunomodulators, persist. In this study, a tumor&#8208;selective nano&#8208;regulator named PNBJQ has been presented, focusing on targeting two non&#8208;redundant immune nodes: inducing immunogenic cancer cell death and abrogating immune resistance to fully activate endogenous tumor immunity. PNBJQ is obtained by encapsulating the immunomodulating agent JQ1 within a self&#8208;assembling system formed by linking a Type&#8208;I photosensitizer to polyethylene glycol through a hypoxia&#8208;sensitive azo bond. Benefiting from the Type&#8208;I photosensitive mechanism, PNBJQ triggers the immunogenic cell death of hypoxic tumors under NIR light irradiation. This process resolves innate immune resistance by stimulating sufficient cytotoxic T&#8208;lymphocytes. Simultaneously, PNBJQ smartly responds to the hypoxic tumor microenvironment for precise drug delivery, adeptly addressing adaptive immune resistance by using JQ1 to down&#8208;regulate PD&#8208;L1 and sustaining the response of cytotoxic T lymphocytes. The activatable synergic photoimmunotherapy promotes an immune&#8208;promoting tumor microenvironment by activating an iterative revolution of the CIC, which remarkably eradicates established hypoxic tumors and suppresses distal lesions under low light dose irradiation.

         <title>Transdermal Sensing of Enzyme Biomarker Enabled by Chemo&#8208;Responsive Probe&#8208;Modified Epidermal Microneedle Patch in Human skin Tissue</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Wearable bioelectronics represents a significant breakthrough in healthcare settings, particularly in (bio)sensing which offers an alternative way to track individual health for diagnostics and therapy. However, there has been no notable improvement in the field of cancer, particularly for skin cancer. Here, we established a wearable bioelectronic patch for transdermal sensing of the melanoma biomarker, tyrosinase (Tyr), using a microneedle array integrated with a surface&#8208;bound chemo&#8208;responsive smart probe to enable target&#8208;specific electrochemical detection of Tyr directly from human skin tissue. The results presented herein demonstrated the feasibility of a transdermal microneedle sensor for direct quantification of enzyme biomarkers in an ex vivo skin model. Initial performance analysis of the transdermal microneedle sensor proved that the designed methodology could be an alternative for fast and reliable diagnosis of melanoma and the evaluation of skin moles. The innovative approach presented here might revolutionize the landscape of skin monitoring by offering a non&#8208;disruptive means for continuous surveillance and timely intervention of skin anomalies such as inflammatory skin diseases or allergies and can be extended to the screening of multiple responses of complementary biomarkers with simple modification in device design.

         <title>Terahertz and Infrared Plasmon Polaritons in PtTe2 Type&#8208;II Dirac Topological Semimetal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) are electromagnetic excitations existing at the interface between a metal and a dielectric. SPPs provide a promising path in nanophotonic devices&#160;for&#160;light manipulation at the micro and nanoscale with applications in optoelectronics, biomedicine, and energy harvesting. Recently, SPPs have been extended to unconventional materials like graphene, transparent oxides, superconductors, and topological systems characterized by linearly dispersive electronic bands. In this case, three&#8208;dimensional Dirac and Weyl semimetals offer a promising frontier for infrared (IR) and terahertz (THz) radiation tuning by topologically&#8208;protected SPPs.&#160;In this work, we investigate the THz&#8208;IR optical response, of platinum ditelluride (PtTe2) type&#8208;II Dirac topological semimetal films grown on Si substrates. We detect SPPs generated on microscale ribbon arrays of PtTe2&#160;in the far&#8208;field limit,&#160;finding an excellent agreement among measurements, theoretical model, and electromagnetic simulation data.&#160;The far&#8208;field measurements have been further supported by near&#8208;field infrared data which indicate a strong electric field enhancement due to the SPP excitation near the ribbon edges. The whole results of this paper, indicate that PtTe2&#160;ribbon array appears an ideal&#160;active layout for geometrically tunable SPPs thus inspiring a new fashion of optically tunable materials in the technologically demanding THz and IR spectrum.

         <title>Uniaxial&#8208;Oriented Chiral Perovskite for Flexible Full&#8208;Stokes Polarimeter</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Full&#8208;Stokes polarization detection, with high integration and portability, offers an efficient path toward next&#8208;gen multi&#8208;information optoelectronic systems. Nevertheless, current techniques relying on optical filters create rigid and bulky configurations, limiting practicality. Here, we first report a flexible, filter&#8208;less full&#8208;Stokes polarimeter featuring a uniaxial&#8208;oriented chiral perovskite film. We find that, the strategic manipulation of the surfactant&#8208;mediated Marangoni effect during blade coating, is crucial for guiding an equilibrious mass transport to achieve oriented crystallization. Through this approach, the obtained uniaxial&#8208;oriented chiral perovskite films inherently possess anisotropy and chirality, and thereby with desired sensitivity to both Linearly Polarized Light (LPL) and Circularly Polarized Light (CPL) vectors. The uniaxial&#8208;oriented crystalline structure also improves photodetection, achieving a specific detectivity of 5.23 &#215; 1013 Jones, surpassing non&#8208;oriented devices by 10x. The as&#8208;fabricated flexible polarimeters enable accurate capture of full&#8208;Stokes polarization without optical filters, exhibiting slight detection errors for the Stokes parameters: &#916;S1 = 9.2%, &#916;S2 = 8.6%, and &#916;S3 = 6.5%, approaching the detection accuracy of optics&#8208;filter polarimeters. Our proof of concept also demonstrates applications in matrix polarization imaging.

         <title>Stereoscopic Polymer Network for Developing Mechanically Robust Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells with an Efficiency Approaching 25%</title>

Abstract
Flexible perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs) have the potential to overturn the application scenario of silicon photovoltaic technology. However, their mechanical instability severely impedes their practical applicability, and the corresponding intrinsic degradation mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we systematically analyzed the degradation behavior of flexible pero&#8208;SCs under mechanical stress and observed that the structural failure firstly occurs in the polycrystal perovskite film, then extend to interfaces. To suppress the structural failure, we employed pentaerythritol triacrylate, a crosslinked molecule with three stereoscopic crosslink sites, to establish a three&#8208;dimensional polymer network in both the interface and bulk perovskite. This network reduced the Young's modulus of the perovskite and simultaneously enhanced the interfacial toughness. As a result, the formation of cracks and delamination, which occur under a high mechanical stress, was significantly suppressed in the flexible pero&#8208;SC, which consequently retained 92% of its initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) after 20000 bending cycles. Notably, the flexible device also showed a record PCE of 24.9% (certified 24.48%).

         <title>Accumulation of Long&#8208;Lived Photogenerated Holes at Indium Single Atom Catalysts via Two Coordinate Nitrogen Vacancy Defect Engineering for Enhanced Photocatalytic Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Visible light&#8208;driven photocatalytic oxidation by photogenerated holes has immense potential for environmental remediation applications. While the electron&#8208;mediated photoreduction reactions are often at the spotlight, active holes possess a remarkable oxidation capacity that can degrade recalcitrant organic pollutants, resulting in non&#8208;toxic byproducts. However, the random charge transfer and rapid recombination of electron&#8208;hole pairs hinder the accumulation of long&#8208;lived holes at the reaction center. Herein, we report a novel method employing defect&#8208;engineered indium (In) single atom photocatalysts, dispersed in carbon nitride foam (In&#8208;Nv&#8208;CNF), to overcome these challenges and make further advances in photocatalysis. This Nv (nitrogen vacancy) defect&#8208;engineered strategy produces a remarkable extension in the lifetime of photogenerated holes and an increase in the concentration of photogenerated holes in In&#8208;Nv&#8208;CNF. Consequently, the optimized In&#8208;Nv&#8208;CNF demonstrates a remarkable 50&#8208;fold increase in photo&#8208;oxidative degradation rate compared to pristine CN, effectively breaking down two widely used antibiotics (tetracycline and ciprofloxacin) under visible light. The contaminated water treated by In&#8208;Nv&#8208;CNF has proven to be completely non&#8208;toxic based on the growth of E. coli before and after treatment. Structural&#8208;performance correlations between Nv defect engineering and long&#8208;lived hole accumulation in In&#8208;Nv&#8208;CNF are established and validated through experimental and theoretical agreement. This work has the potential to elevate the efficiency of overall photocatalytic reactions from a hole&#8208;centric standpoint.

         <title>A Polyplatin with Hands&#8208;Holding Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;II Fluorophores and Prodrugs at a Precise Ratio for Tracking Drug Fate with Realtime Readout and Treatment Feedback</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For real&#8208;time drug tracking with accurate drug metabolism information, a near infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II) fluorophore is conjugated with Pt(IV) prodrug via a covalent bond to form PolyplatinDT. PolymerDT DT then self&#8208;assembled into NanoplatinDT. Attaching caspase&#8208;3 sensitive peptide onto NanoplatinDT forms NanoplatinDTR, which enables simultaneously drug tracking with NIR&#8208;II fluorescence and evaluating its therapeutic efficacy with green fluorescence. 








Abstract
The in vivo fate of chemotherapeutic drugs plays a vital role in understanding the therapeutic outcome, side effects, and the mechanism. However, the lack of imaging abilities of drugs, tedious labeling processes, and premature leakage of imaging agents result in loss of fidelity between the drugs and imaging signals. Herein, an amphiphilic polymer is created by copolymerization of a near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II) fluorophore tracer (T) and an anticancer Pt(IV) prodrug (D) of cisplatin in a hand&#8208;holding manner into one polymer chain for the first time. The obtained PolyplatinDT is capable of delivering the drugs and the fluorophores concomitantly at a precise D/T ratio, thereby resulting in tracking the platinum drugs and even readout of them in real&#8208;time via NIR&#8208;II imaging. PolyplatinDT can self&#8208;assemble into nanoparticles, referred to as NanoplatinDT. Furthermore, a caspase&#8208;3 cleavable peptide that serves as an apoptosis reporter is attached to NanoplatinDT, resulting in NanoplatinDTR that are capable of simultaneously tracking platinum drugs and evaluating the therapeutic efficacy. Overall, it is reported here the design of the first theranostic polymer with anticancer drugs, drug tracers, and drug efficacy reporters that can work in concert to provide insight into the drug fate and mechanism of action.

         <title>Binary Organic Solar Cells with Exceeding 19% Efficiency via the Synergy of Polyfluoride Polymer and Fluorous Solvent</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Rational molecular design and suitable device engineering are two important strategies to boost the efficiencies in organic solar cells (OSCs). Yet these two approaches are independently developed, while their synergy is believed to be more productive. Herein, a branched polyfluoride moiety, heptafluoroisopropoxyl group, is introduced into the sidechains of conjugated polymers for the first time. Compared with the conventional alkyl chain, this polyfluoride chain can endow the resulting polymer namely PF7 with highly packing order and strong crystallinity owing to the strong polarization and fluorine&#8208;induced interactions, while good solubility and moderate miscibility are retained. As a result, PF7 comprehensively outperforms the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polymer PM6 in photovoltaic properties. More importantly, based on the solubility of heptafluoroisopropoxyl groups in fluorous solvents, a new post&#8208;treatment denoted as fluorous solvent vapor annealing (FSVA) is proposed to match PF7. Differing from the existing post&#8208;treatments, FSVA can selectively reorganize fluoropolymer molecules but less impact small molecules in blend films. By employing the synergy of fluoropolymer and fluorous solvent, the device achieves a remarkable efficiency of 19.09%, which is among the best efficiencies in binary OSCs. The polymer PF7 and the FSVA treatment exhibit excellent universality in various OSCs with different material combinations or device architectures.

         <title>Hidden Real Topology and Unusual Magnetoelectric Responses in Two&#8208;Dimensional Antiferromagnets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The monolayer Cr2Se2O is reported as the first material example of a 2D antiferromagnetic (AFM) real Chern insulator with topologically protected corner states. A hidden real topology in 2D AFM materials with mirror symmetry is unveiled. Due to antiferromagnetism, the corner modes in Cr2Se2O exhibit strong corner&#8208;contrasted spin polarization, leading to spin&#8211;corner coupling (SCC). SCC enables the direct control of the net magnetization of the system by both local and global electric methods.








Abstract
Recently, the real topology has been attracting widespread interest in two dimensions (2D). Here, based on first&#8208;principles calculations and theoretical analysis, the monolayer Cr2Se2O (ML&#8208;CrSeO) is revealed as the first material example of a 2D antiferromagnetic (AFM) real Chern insulator (RCI) with topologically protected corner states. Unlike previous RCIs, it is found that the real topology of the ML&#8208;CrSeO is rooted in one certain mirror subsystem of the two spin channels, and cannot be directly obtained from all the valence bands in each spin channel as commonly believed. In particular, due to antiferromagnetism, the corner modes in ML&#8208;CrSeO exhibit strong corner&#8208;contrasted spin polarization, leading to spin&#8211;corner coupling (SCC). This SCC enables a direct connection between spin space and real space. Consequently, large and switchable net magnetization can be induced in the ML&#8208;CrSeO nanodisk by electrostatic means, such as potential step and in&#8208;plane electric field, and the corresponding magnetoelectric responses behave like a sign function, distinguished from that of the conventional multiferroic materials. This work considerably broadens the candidate range of RCI materials, and opens up a new direction for topo&#8208;spintronics and 2D AFM materials&#160;research.

Flexible metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) adsorbents commonly encounter limitations in removing trace impurities below gate&#8208;opening threshold pressures. Topology reconfiguration can fundamentally eliminate intrinsic structural flexibility, yet remains a formidable challenge and is rarely achieved in practical applications. Herein, we present a solvent&#8208;mediated approach to regulate the flexible CuSnF6&#8208;dpds&#8208;sql (dpds = 4,4&#8242;'&#8208;dipyridyldisulfide) with sql topology into rigid CuSnF6&#8208;dpds&#8208;cds with cds topology. Notably, the cds topology is unprecedented and firstly obtained in anion&#8208;pillared MOF materials. As a result, rigid CuSnF6&#8208;dpds&#8208;cds exhibits enhanced C2H2 adsorption capacity of 48.61 cm3 g&#8722;1 at 0.01&#160;bar compared to flexible CuSnF6&#8208;dpds&#8208;sql (21.06 cm3 g&#8722;1). The topology transformation also facilitates the adsorption kinetics for C2H2, exhibiting a 6.5&#8208;fold enhanced diffusion time constant (D/r2) of 1.71 &#215; 10&#8722;3 s&#8722;1 on CuSnF6&#8208;dpds&#8208;cds than that of CuSnF6&#8208;dpds&#8208;sql (2.64 &#215; 10&#8722;4 s&#8722;1). Multiple computational simulations reveal the structural transformations and guest&#8208;host interactions in both adsorbents. Furthermore, dynamic breakthrough experiments demonstrate that high&#8208;purity C2H4 (&gt;99.996%) effluent with a productivity of 93.9&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 can be directly collected from C2H2/C2H4 (1/99, v/v) gas&#8208;mixture in a single CuSnF6&#8208;dpds&#8208;cds column.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Luminescent Materials Incorporating Rare Earth/Transition Metal Ions: From Materials to Applications</title>

Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared materials exhibiting high photoluminescence quantum yields present a promising avenue to broaden our capacity and threshold for detection and manipulation, extending beyond the visible emission range. The spotlight has shifted to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) luminescent materials emitting beyond 1000&#160;nm, with growing interest due to their unique characteristics. The ability of NIR&#8208;II emission (1000&#8208;1700&#160;nm) to penetrate deeply and transmit independently positions these NIR luminescent materials for applications in optical&#8208;communication devices, bioimaging, and photodetectors. The combination of rare earth metals/transition metals with a variety of matrix materials provides a new platform for creating new chemical and physical properties for materials science and device applications. In this review, we summarize the recent advancements in NIR emission activated by rare earth and transition metal ions and illustrate their role in applications spanning bioimaging, sensing, and optoelectronics. We start from the various synthesis techniques, including high&#8208;temperature solid&#8208;state, hydrothermal, and thermal decomposition methods, on how to delicately incorporate the rare&#8208;earth/transition metals to the NIR various matrixes, each imparting distinct characteristics to these luminescent materials. We then extend the discussion to strategies of enhancing excitation absorption and emission efficiency, spotlighting innovations like dye sensitization and surface plasmon resonance effects. Subsequently, a significant focus is placed on functionalization strategies and their applications. Finally, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the challenges and proposed strategies for rare earth/transition metal ion&#8208;doped near&#8208;infrared luminescent materials, summarizing the insights of each section.

         <title>Correlating Aggregation Ability of Polymer Donors with Film Formation Kinetics for Organic Solar Cells with Improved Efficiency and Processability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted pyridine units are introduced into D18 to synthesize two terpolymers with modulated aggregation abilities. Earlier phase separation and longer film formation times are achieved and lead to superior blend film morphology, resulting in efficiencies of 19.45%, 13.07%, and 12.43% in small area organic solar cell device, 1 cm2 flexible device, and 43 cm2 module fabricated by slot&#8208;die coating.








Abstract
Film formation kinetics significantly impact molecular processability and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells. Here, two ternary random copolymerization polymers are reported, D18&#9472;N&#8208;p and D18&#9472;N&#8208;m, to modulate the aggregation ability of D18 by introducing trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted pyridine unit at para&#8208; and meta&#8208;positions, respectively. The introduction of pyridine unit significantly reduces material aggregation ability and adjusts the interactions with acceptor L8&#8208;BO, thereby leading to largely changed film formation kinetics with earlier phase separation and longer film formation times, which enlarge fiber sizes in blend films and improve carrier generation and transport. As a result, D18&#9472;N&#8208;p with moderate aggregation ability delivers a high PCE of 18.82% with L8&#8208;BO, which is further improved to 19.45% via interface engineering. Despite the slightly inferior small area device performances, D18&#9472;N&#8208;m shows improved solubility, which inspires to adjust the ratio of meta&#8208;trifluoromethyl pyridine carefully and obtain a polymer donor D18&#9472;N&#8208;m&#8208;10 with good solubility in nonhalogenated solvent o&#8208;xylene. High PCEs of 13.07% and 12.43% in 1 cm2 device and 43 cm2 module fabricated with slot&#8208;die coating method are achieved based on D18&#9472;N&#8208;m&#8208;10:L8&#8208;BO blends. This work emphasizes film formation kinetics optimization in device fabrication via aggregation ability modulation of polymer donors for efficient devices.

         <title>Efficient Large&#8208;Area (81 cm2) Ternary Copper Halides Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with External Quantum Efficiency Exceeding 13% via Host&#8208;Guest Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A host&#8208;guest design strategy is adopted to simultaneously improve the exciton radiative recombination and charge injection efficiency in lead&#8208;free [dppb]2Cu2I2 emitters. Consequently, efficient green&#8208;emitting LEDs with a record external quantum efficiency of 13.39% and a large&#8208;area emitting area up to 81 cm2 with uniform emission are realized, substantially surpassing those of recently reported Cu halide&#8208;based devices.








Abstract
Ternary copper (Cu) halides are promising candidates for replacing toxic lead halides in the field of perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) toward practical applications. However, the electroluminescent performance of Cu halide&#8208;based LEDs remains a great challenge due to the presence of serious nonradiative recombination and inefficient charge transport in Cu halide emitters. Here, the rational design of host&#8208;guest [dppb]2Cu2I2 (dppb denotes 1,2&#8208;bis[diphenylphosphino]benzene) emitters and its utility in fabricating efficient Cu halide&#8208;based green LEDs that show a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 13.39% are reported. The host&#8208;guest [dppb]2Cu2I2 emitters with mCP (1,3&#8208;bis(N&#8208;carbazolyl)benzene) host demonstrate a significant improvement of carrier radiative recombination efficiency, with the photoluminescence quantum yield increased by nearly ten times, which is rooted in the efficient energy transfer and type&#8208;I energy level alignment between [dppb]2Cu2I2 and mCP. Moreover, the charge&#8208;transporting mCP host can raise the carrier mobility of [dppb]2Cu2I2 films, thereby enhancing the charge transport and recombination. More importantly, this strategy enables a large&#8208;area prototype LED with a record&#8208;breaking area up to 81 cm2, along with a decent EQE of 10.02% and uniform luminance. It is believed these results represent an encouraging stepping stone to bring Cu halide&#8208;based LEDs from the laboratory toward commercial lighting and display panels.

Fabricating Li metal anodes with specific crystal plane is considered as a promising strategy for suppressing the growth of Li dendrites, but a simple and high&#8208;efficient approach is still lacking. Herein, a facile and controllable way for tailoring polished Li metal anodes with highly preferred (110) and (200) crystal orientation by regulating the times of accumulative roll bonding, is reported.








Abstract
A formidable challenge to achieve the practical applications of rechargeable lithium (Li) metal batteries (RLMBs) is to suppress the uncontrollable growth of Li dendrites. One of the most effective solutions is to fabricate Li metal anodes with specific crystal plane, but still lack of a simple and high&#8208;efficient approach. Herein, a facile and controllable way for the scalable customization of polished Li metal anodes with highly preferred (110) and (200) crystallographic orientation (donating as polished Li(110) and polished Li(200), respectively) by regulating the times of accumulative roll bonding, is reported. According to the inherent characteristics of polished Li(110)/Li(200), the influence of Li atomic structure on the electrochemical performance of RLMBs is deeply elucidated by combining theoretical calculations with relative experimental proofs. In particular, a polished Li(110) crystal plane is demonstrated to induce Li+ uniform deposition, promoting the formation of flat and dense Li deposits. Impressively, the polished Li(110)||LiFePO4 full cells exhibit unprecedented cycling stability with 10&#160;000 cycles at 10 C almost without capacity degradation, indicating the great potential application prospect of such textured Li metal. More valuably, this work provides an important reference for low&#8208;cost, continued, and large&#8208;scale production of Li metal anodes with highly preferred crystal orientation through roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll manufacturability.

         <title>Regulation of Protein Conformation Enables Cell&#8208;Selective Targeting of Virus&#8208;Mimicking Nanoparticles for siRNA Therapy of Glioblastoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, a strategy is proposed to regulate protein conformation through lipid nanoenvironment to build virus&#8208;mimicking nanoparticles (VMNs) for the efficient delivery of small interfering RNA, which have excellent cell&#8208;selective targeting ability and retain the lysosomal escape properties of the virus, thus enabling the precise enrichment of VMNs in glioblastoma brain tumor region for efficient therapeutic purposes.








Abstract
Orthotopic glioblastoma (GBM) has an aggressive growth pattern and complex pathogenesis, becoming one of the most common and deadly tumors of the central nervous system (CNS). The emergence of RNA therapies offers promise for the treatment of GBM. However, the efficient and precise delivery of RNA drugs to specific tumor cells in the brain with high cellular heterogeneity remains ongoing. Here, a strategy is proposed to regulate protein conformation through lipid nanoenvironments to custom&#8208;design virus&#8208;mimicking nanoparticles (VMNs) with excellent selective cell targeting capabilities, leading to efficient and precise delivery of small interfering RNA for effective treatment of GBM. The optimized VMNs not only retain the ability to cross the blood&#8211;brain barrier and release the RNA by lysosomal escape like natural viruses but also ensure precise enrichment in the GBM area. This study lays the conceptual foundation for the custom design of VMNs with superior cell&#8208;selective targeting capabilities and opens up the possibility of RNA therapies for the efficient treatment of GBM and CNS tumors.

         <title>Atto&#8208;Scale Noise Near&#8208;Infrared Organic Photodetectors Enabled by Controlling Interfacial Energetic Offset through Enhanced Anchoring Ability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study examines the JD and noise equiv. power (NEP) in NIR OPDs with varying electron blocking layers (EBLs). A newly synthesized EBL (named 3PAFBr) is introduced via a JD generation mechanism, significantly impacting NEP. The 3PAFBr&#8208;based OPD demonstrates a noise current of 852 aA (JD = 12.3 fA&#160;cm&#8315;2 at V &#8594; &#8722;0.1 V) and achieves several femtowatt&#8208;scale NEPs.








Abstract
The near&#8208;infrared (NIR) sensor technology is crucial for various applications such as autonomous driving and biometric tracking. Silicon photodetectors (SiPDs) are widely used in NIR applications; however, their scalability is limited by their crystalline properties. Organic photodetectors (OPDs) have attracted attention for NIR applications owing to their scalability, low&#8208;temperature processing, and notably low dark current density (JD), which is similar to that of SiPDs. However, the still high JD (at NIR band) and few measurements of noise equivalent powers (NEPs) pose challenges for accurate performance comparisons. This study addresses these issues by quantitatively characterizing the performance matrix and JD generation mechanism using electron&#8208;blocking layers (EBLs) in OPDs. The energy offset at an EBL/photosensitive layer interface determines the thermal activation energy and directly affects JD. A newly synthesized EBL (3PAFBr) substantially enhances the interfacial energy barrier by forming a homogeneous contact owing to the improved anchoring ability of 3PAFBr. As a result, the OPD with 3PAFBr yields a noise current of 852 aA (JD = 12.3 fA&#160;cm&#8315;2 at V &#8594; &#8722;0.1&#160;V) and several femtowatt&#8208;scale NEPs. As far as it is known, this is an ultralow of&#160;JD in NIR OPDs. This emphasizes the necessity for quantitative performance characterization.

         <title>A Vacancy&#8208;Engineering Ferroelectric Nanomedicine for Cuproptosis/Apoptosis Co&#8208;Activated Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
BCO&#8208;VCu induces apoptosis by triggering a burst of reactive oxygen species under ultrasound irradiation; it acts as a switch to reduce Cu+ efflux and alterations in proteins such as dihydrolipoic acid S&#8208;acetyltransferase, ferredoxin 1, inducing the occurrence of cuproptosis. More importantly, it triggers immunogenic cell death, which causes a strong immune response.








Abstract
Low efficacy of immunotherapy due to the poor immunogenicity of most tumors and their insufficient infiltration by immune cells highlights the importance of inducing immunogenic cell death and activating immune system for achieving better treatment outcomes. Herein, ferroelectric Bi2CuO4 nanoparticles with rich copper vacancies (named BCO&#8208;VCu) are rationally designed and engineered for ferroelectricity&#8208;enhanced apoptosis, cuproptosis, and the subsequently evoked immunotherapy. In this structure, the suppressed recombination of the electron&#8211;hole pairs by the vacancies and the band bending by the ferroelectric polarization lead to high catalytic activity, triggering reactive oxygen species bursts and inducing apoptosis. The cell fragments produced by apoptosis serve as antigens to activate T cells. Moreover, due to the generated charge by the ferroelectric catalysis, this nanomedicine can act as &#8220;a smart switch&#8221; to open the cell membrane, promote nanomaterial endocytosis, and shut down the Cu+ outflow pathway to evoke cuproptosis, and thus a strong immune response is triggered by the reduced content of adenosine triphosphate. Ribonucleic acid transcription tests reveal the pathways related to immune response activation. Thus, this study firstly demonstrates a feasible strategy for enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapy using single ferroelectric semiconductor&#8208;induced apoptosis and cuproptosis.

         <title>Accelerated Engineering of ELP&#8208;Based Materials through Hybrid Biomimetic&#8208;De Novo Predictive Molecular Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a novel hybrid biomimetic design using elastin&#8208;like polypeptides (ELPs), this study accelerates de novo protein material engineering. This work combines computational modeling, deep learning, and genetic engineering to create ELP variants that maintain structural integrity and demonstrate controllable self&#8208;assembly. This method offers a versatile template for the design of novel structural proteins and broadening their applications.








Abstract
Efforts to engineer high&#8208;performance protein&#8208;based materials inspired by nature have mostly focused on altering naturally occurring sequences to confer the desired functionalities, whereas de novo design lags significantly behind and calls for unconventional innovative approaches. Here, using partially disordered elastin&#8208;like polypeptides (ELPs) as initial building blocks this work shows that de novo engineering of protein materials can be accelerated through hybrid biomimetic design, which this work achieves by integrating computational modeling, deep neural network, and recombinant DNA technology. This generalizable approach involves incorporating a series of de novo&#8208;designed sequences with &#945;&#8208;helical conformation and genetically encoding them into biologically inspired intrinsically disordered repeating motifs. The new ELP variants maintain structural conformation and showed tunable supramolecular self&#8208;assembly out of thermal equilibrium with phase behavior in vitro. This work illustrates the effective translation of the predicted molecular designs in structural and functional materials. The proposed methodology can be applied to a broad range of partially disordered biomacromolecules and potentially pave the way toward the discovery of novel structural proteins.

Here, using partially disordered elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs) as initial building blocks this work shows that de novo engineering of protein materials can be accelerated through hybrid biomimetic design, which this work achieves by integrating computational modeling, deep neural network, and recombinant DNA technology. This generalizable approach involves incorporating a series of de novo-designed sequences with &#945;-helical conformation and genetically encoding them into biologically inspired intrinsically disordered repeating motifs. The new ELP variants maintain structural conformation and showed tunable supramolecular self-assembly out of thermal equilibrium with phase behavior in vitro. This work illustrates the effective translation of the predicted molecular designs in structural and functional materials. The proposed methodology can be applied to a broad range of partially disordered biomacromolecules and potentially pave the way toward the discovery of novel structural proteins.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Magnetic navigation systems are used to precisely manipulate magnetically responsive materials enabling the realization of new minimally invasive procedures using magnetic medical devices. Their widespread applicability has been constrained by high infrastructure demands and costs. we report on a portable electromagnetic navigation system, the Navion, which is capable of generating a large magnetic field over a large workspace. The system is easy to install in hospital operating rooms and transportable through healthcare facilities, aiding in the widespread adoption of magnetically responsive medical devices. First, we introduce our design and implementation approach for the system and characterize its performance. Next, we demonstrate in vitro navigation of different microrobot structures using magnetic field gradients and rotating magnetic fields. Spherical permanent magnets, electroplated cylindrical microrobots, microparticle swarms, and magnetic composite bacteria&#8208;inspired helical structures are investigated. we also demonstrate the navigation of magnetic catheters in two challenging endovascular tasks: (1) an angiography procedure and (2) deep navigation within the circle of Willis. Catheter navigation is demonstrated in a porcine model in vivo to perform an angiography under magnetic guidance.

         <title>A Single Component, Single Layer Flexile Foam Evaporator with the Higher Efficiency for Water Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
One of the greenest and promising ways to solve the problem of freshwater crisis is surface solar steam generation from seawater. A great number of photothermal materials with multi&#8208;component and multi&#8208;layered delicate yet complex structures often suffer from either low evaporation rate or high energy loss. Here, we present a single component foam evaporator with steam generation rate of up to 4.32&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 under 1 sun irradiation. The evaporator is constructed from an aniline oligomer as a single light&#8208;absorbing component, covalent linked with polyethylene glycol to form a monolithic polymer foam. Floating on the seawater, the foam has absorbance of 99.5% over the entire solar spectral range and low thermal conductivity (0.0077&#160;W K&#8722;1m&#8722;1) that effectively retains heat in the material and at the interface. After 3 months of continuous outdoor natural sunlight irradiation, the evaporator maintains a stable and durable evaporation rate. Moreover, the materials have good mechanical properties (7.48&#160;MPa young's modulus and 57.38% elongation at break) and excellent chemical resistance in 10 common organic solvents and aqueous solutions of pH = 1 to 14. This study provides a new system and strategy for desalination, steam power generation, treatment of polluted water and sewage, etc.

         <title>Synchronous Switching Strategy to Enhance the Real&#8208;Time Powering and Charging Performance of Triboelectric Nanogenerator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) are of great significance as sustainable power sources that harvest energy from the human body and environment. Nevertheless, due to TENG's impedance&#8208;dependent output voltage characteristics, in traditional strategy (TS), real&#8208;timely powering a sensor with TENG has a poor sensing on/off ratio (or response), and directly charging a capacitor with TENG shows a low charging efficiency. This degraded real&#8208;time powering and charging performance of TENG compared to a commercial constant voltage source has been a huge challenge of the TENG field for a long time. Here, we propose a synchronous switching strategy (SSS) for TENG to real&#8208;timely power sensors or charge capacitors without degrading its performance. Compared with TS, this new strategy enables sensors to have 5&#8211;7 times sensing on/off ratio enhancement when using TENG as a power source, reaching the powering ability of a commercial constant voltage source, it makes the powering performance of TENG stable under different driving frequency, improving the powering robustness of TENG. In addition, compared with TS, SSS can also enhance the charging efficiency of TENG in every charging cycle by up to 2.4 times when charging capacitors. This work contributes to real&#8208;timely powering or charging the distributed, mobile and wireless electronics using TENG.

         <title>A Suspended, Three&#8208;dimensional Morphing Sensory System for Robots to Feel and Protect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Artificial sensory systems with synergistic touch and pain perception hold substantial promise for environment interaction and human&#8208;robot communication. However, the realization of biological skin&#8208;like functional integration of sensors with sensitive touch and pain perception still remains a challenge. Here, we propose a concept of suspended electronic skins enabling three&#8208;dimensional deformation&#8208;mechanical contact interactions for achieving synergetic ultra&#8208;sensitive touch and adjustable pain perception. The suspended sensory system can sensitively capture tiny touch stimuli as low as 0.02&#160;Pa and actively perceive pain response with reliable 5200 cycles via 3D deformation and mechanical contact mechanism, respectively. Based on the touch&#8208;pain effect, a visualized feedback demo with miniaturized sensor arrays on artificial fingers is rationally designed to give a pain perception mapping on sharp surfaces. Furthermore, we show the capability of the suspended electronic skin serving as a safe human&#8208;robot communication interface from active and passive view through a feedback control system, demonstrating potential in bionic electronics and intelligent robotics.

         <title>Composition dictates octahedral tilt and photostability in halide perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Halide perovskites are excellent candidate materials for use in solar cell, LED, and detector devices, in part because their composition can be tuned to achieve ideal optoelectronic properties. Empirical efficiency optimisation has led the field towards compositions rich in FA (formamidinium) on the A&#8208;site and I on the X&#8208;site, with additional small amounts of MA (methylammonium) or Cs A&#8208;site cations and Br X&#8208;site anions. However, it is not clear how and why the specific compositions of alloyed, i.e., mixed component, halide perovskites relate to photo&#8208;stability of the materials. Here, we combine synchrotron grazing incidence wide&#8208;angle x&#8208;ray scattering, photoluminescence, high&#8208;resolution scanning electron diffraction measurements and theoretical modelling to reveal the links between material structure and photostability. Namely, we find that increased octahedral titling leads to improved photo&#8208;stability that is correlated with lower densities of performance&#8208;harming hexagonal polytype impurities. Our results uncover the structural signatures underpinning photo&#8208;stability and can therefore be used to make targeted changes to halide perovskites, bettering the commercial prospects of technologies based on these materials.

         <title>Deep&#8208;Blue and Fast Delayed Fluorescence from Carbene&#8208;Metal&#8208;Amides for Highly Efficient and Stable Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Linear gold complexes of the &#8220;carbene&#8208;metal&#8208;amide&#8221; (CMA) type are prepared with a rigid benzoguanidine amide donor and various carbene ligands. These complexes emit in the deep&#8208;blue range at 424 and 466&#160;nm with 100% quantum yields in all media. The deep&#8208;blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) originates from a charge transfer state (CT) with an excited state lifetime as low as 213&#160;ns, resulting in fast radiative rates of 4.7 &#215; 106 s&#8722;1. The high thermal and photo&#8208;stability of these CMA materials enabled us to fabricate highly energy efficient organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLED) in host&#8208;guest architectures. We report deep&#8208;blue OLED devices with electroluminescence at 416&#160;nm and 457&#160;nm with practical external quantum efficiencies of up to 23% at 100&#160;cd m&#8722;2 with excellent colour coordinates CIE (x; y) = 0.16; 0.07 and 0.17; 0.18. The operating stability of these OLEDs is the longest reported to date (LT50 = 1 hour) for deep&#8208;blue CMA emitters, indicating a high promise for further development of blue OLED devices. Our findings inform the molecular design strategy and correlation between delayed luminescence with high radiative rates and CMA OLED device operating stability.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linear gold complexes of the &#8220;carbene-metal-amide&#8221; (CMA) type are prepared with a rigid benzoguanidine amide donor and various carbene ligands. These complexes emit in the deep-blue range at 424 and 466&#160;nm with 100% quantum yields in all media. The deep-blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) originates from a charge transfer state (CT) with an excited state lifetime as low as 213&#160;ns, resulting in fast radiative rates of 4.7 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The high thermal and photo-stability of these CMA materials enabled us to fabricate highly energy efficient organic light-emitting diodes (OLED) in host-guest architectures. We report deep-blue OLED devices with electroluminescence at 416&#160;nm and 457&#160;nm with practical external quantum efficiencies of up to 23% at 100&#160;cd m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with excellent colour coordinates CIE (x; y) = 0.16; 0.07 and 0.17; 0.18. The operating stability of these OLEDs is the longest reported to date (LT&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 hour) for deep-blue CMA emitters, indicating a high promise for further development of blue OLED devices. Our findings inform the molecular design strategy and correlation between delayed luminescence with high radiative rates and CMA OLED device operating stability.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Boosting Upconversion Efficiency in Optically Inert Shelled Structures with Electroactive Membrane through Electron Donation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
This study innovatively addresses challenges in enhancing upconversion efficiency in lanthanide&#8208;based nanoparticles (UCNPs) by exploiting Shewanella oneidensis MR&#8208;1, a microorganism capable of extracellular electron transfer. Electroactive membranes, rich in c&#8208;type cytochromes, are extracted from bacteria and integrated into membrane&#8208;integrated liposomes (MILs), encapsulating core&#8208;shelled UCNPs with an optically inactive shell, forming UCNP@MIL constructs. The electroactive membrane, tailored to donate electrons through the inert shell, independently boosts upconversion emission under near&#8208;infrared excitation (980&#160;nm or 1550&#160;nm), bypassing ligand&#8208;sensitized UCNPs. The optically inactive shell restricts energy migration, emphasizing electroactive membrane electron donation. Density functional theory calculations elucidate efficient electron transfer due to the electroactive membrane hemes' highest occupied molecular orbital being higher than the valence band maximum of the optically inactive shell, crucial for enhancing energy transfer to emitter ions. The introduction of a SiO2 insulator coating diminishes light enhancement, underscoring the importance of unimpeded electron transfer. Luminescence enhancement remains resilient to variations in emitter or sensitizing ions, highlighting the robustness of the electron transfer&#8208;induced phenomenon. However, altering the inert shell material diminishes enhancement, emphasizing the role of electron transfer. This methodology holds significant promise for diverse biological applications. UCNP@MIL offers an advantage in cellular uptake, which proves beneficial for cell imaging.

         <title>Controlled Growth Lateral/Vertical Heterostructure Interface for Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Artificial heterostructures with structural advancements and customizable electronic interfaces are fundamental for achieving high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Here, we propose a design idea for a covalently bonded lateral/vertical black phosphorus (BP)&#8208;graphdiyne oxide (GDYO) heterostructure achieved through a facile ball&#8208;milling approach. Lateral heterogeneity is realized by the sp2&#8208;hybridized mode P&#8208;C bonds, which connects the phosphorus atoms at the edges of BP with the carbon atoms of the terminal acetylene in GDYO. The vertical connection of the heterojunction of BP and GDYO is connected by P&#8208;O&#8208;C bond. Experimental and theoretical studies demonstrate that BP&#8208;GDYO incorporates interfacial and structural engineering features, including built&#8208;in electric fields, chemical bond interactions, and maximized nanospace confinement effects. Therefore, BP&#8208;GDYO exhibits improved electrochemical kinetics and enhanced structural stability. Moreover, through ex&#8208; and in&#8208;situ studies, we clarified the lithiation mechanism of BP&#8208;GDYO, highlighting that the introduction of GDYO inhibits the shuttle/dissolution effect of phosphorus intermediates, hinders volume expansion, provides more reactive sites, and ultimately promotes reversible lithium storage. The BP&#8208;GDYO anode exhibits lithium storage performance with high&#8208;rate capacity and long&#8208;cycle stability (602.6 mAh g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles at 2.0 A g&#8722;1). The proposed interfacial and structural engineering are universal and represents a conceptual advance in building high&#8208;performance LIBs electrode.

         <title>Experimental Demonstration of Reservoir Computing with Self&#8208;Assembled Percolating Networks of Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Brain&#8208;like computing with percolating networks of nanoparticles. Successful spoken digit recognition is achieved by converting audio waveforms to electrical signals which are classified using a reservoir computing scheme. The use of parallel reservoirs results in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art accuracy. Similar techniques allow prediction of complex time series as well as nonlinear transformations.








Abstract
The complex self&#8208;assembled network of neurons and synapses that comprises the biological brain enables natural information processing with remarkable efficiency. Percolating networks of nanoparticles (PNNs) are complex self&#8208;assembled nanoscale systems that have been shown to possess many promising brain&#8208;like attributes and which are therefore appealing systems for neuromorphic computation. Here experiments are performed that show that PNNs can be utilized as physical reservoirs within a nanoelectronic reservoir computing framework and demonstrate successful computation for several benchmark tasks (chaotic time series prediction, nonlinear transformation, and memory capacity). For each task, relevant literature results are compiled and it is shown that the performance of the PNNs compares favorably to that previously reported from nanoelectronic reservoirs. It is then demonstrated experimentally that PNNs can be used for spoken digit recognition with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art accuracy. Finally, a parallel reservoir architecture is emulated, which increases the dimensionality and richness of the reservoir outputs and results in further improvements in performance across all tasks.

Abstract
The photovoltaic cells (PVs) are able to convert solar energy to electric energy, while energy storage devices are required to be equipped due to the fluctuations of sunlight. However, the electrical connection of PVs and energy storage devices leads to increased energy consumption, and thus energy storage ability and utilization efficiency are decreased. One of the solutions is to explore an integrated photoelectrochemical energy conversion&#8208;storage device. Up to date, the integrated photo&#8208;rechargeable Li&#8208;ion batteries often suffer from unstable photo&#8208;active materials and flammable electrolytes under illumination, with concerns in safety risk and limited lifetime. To address the critical issues, here a novel photo&#8208;rechargeable aluminum battery (PRAB) is designed with safe ionic liquid electrolytes and stable polyaniline photo&#8208;electrodes. The integrated PRAB presents stable operation with enhanced reversible specific capacity &#8764;191% under illumination. Meanwhile, a simplified continuum model is established to provide rational guidance for designing electrode structures along with charging/discharging strategy to meet the practical operation conditions. The as&#8208;designed PRAB presents energy saving efficiency &#8764;61.92% upon charging and energy output increment &#8764;31.25% during discharging under illumination. The strategy of designing and fabricating stable and safe photo&#8208;rechargeable non&#8208;aqueous Al battery highlights the pathway for substantially promoting the utilization efficiency of solar energy.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Anode Based on Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Glass</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Applying an isotropic metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) glass layer to unlock dendrite&#8208;free lithium metal anode is proposed. Simulation and experimental analyses corroborate the internal monolithic and interfacial merits of MOF glass, facilitating uniform lithium diffusion. The obtained lithium metal anode delivers superior battery performances. This work unveils the promising glassy MOF layer for high&#8208;performance lithium metal batteries.








Abstract
The performance of lithium metal batteries is severely hampered by uncontrollable dendrite growth and volume change within the anode. This work addresses these obstacles by introducing a novel strategy: applying an isotropic and internal grain&#8208;boundary&#8208;free layer, specifically, a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) glass layer with nano&#8208;porosity onto the electrochemically plated lithium metal anode. Both ab initio and classical molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the MOF glass layer makes the lithium transport smooth and uniform via its internal monolithic and interfacial advantages. This MOF glass layer with the fast and more uniform lithium diffusion in the monolithic interior and its interface enables dendrite&#8208;free lithium plating and stripping through surface confinement effect and interfacial effect. When employed in symmetric batteries, the achieved Li metal anode can operate over 300&#160;h at 1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. The full batteries matched with LiFePO4 exhibit high capacity (148&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1), excellent rate performance (61&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 5&#160;C), and outstanding cycling stability (with capacity retention of &#8776;90% after 1000 cycles). The full batteries matched with high&#8208;voltage LiCoO2 also show superior performances. Therefore, the strategy of utilizing a MOF glass layer enables the development of high&#8208;performance lithium metal anodes.

When employed in symmetric batteries, the achieved Li metal anode can operate over 300&#160;h at 1&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The full batteries matched with LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; exhibit high capacity (148&#160;mAh&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), excellent rate performance (61&#160;mAh&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 5&#160;C), and outstanding cycling stability (with capacity retention of &#8776;90% after 1000 cycles). The full batteries matched with high-voltage LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; also show superior performances. Therefore, the strategy of utilizing a MOF glass layer enables the development of high-performance lithium metal anodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enthalpy&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Healing in Thin Metallic Films on Flexible Substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metastable thin Mo1&#8208;xAgx films exhibit self&#8208;healing properties. The system can be stabilized by a segregation barrier. Upon cracking, the barrier directs Ag segregations into the cracks instead of to the surface. The effect is autonomously intrinsic, occurs at room temperature, and it is enhanced with increasing temperature. Cracking of thin metal films causes damage to the flexible polymer substrate.









Abstract
Self&#8208;healing microelectronics are needed for costly applications with limited or without access. They are needed in fields such as space exploration to increase lifetime and decrease both costs and the environmental impact. While advanced self&#8208;healing mechanisms for polymers are numerous, practical ways for self&#8208;healing in metal films have yet to be found. A concept for an autonomous intrinsic self&#8208;healing metallic film system is developed, allowing the healing of cracks in metallic films on flexible substrates. The concept relies on stabilizing metastable thin films with high mixing enthalpy via segregation barriers. This allows the films to possess autonomous intrinsic self&#8208;healing capabilities triggered by cracking at temperatures not detrimental to flexible microelectronics. The effect will be shown on metastable Mo1&#8208;xAgx thin films, stabilized via a Mo segregation barrier. Without a segregation barrier, the system is known to exhibit spontaneous Ag particle formation on the surface. This property is controlled and directed to heal cracks and partially restore the electro&#8208;mechanical properties of the multilayer system. This mechanism opens up the field of self&#8208;healing thin metallic films that could profoundly impact the design of future microelectronics.

         <title>Freestanding Ammonium Vanadate Composite Cathodes with Lattice Self&#8208;Regulation and Ion Exchange for Long&#8208;Lasting Ca&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

Vanadium oxides are particularly attractive as cathode materials for calcium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the cycling lifespan of vanadium oxides in organic electrolytes at room temperature still falls short of 1000 cycles. Here, the calcium storage performance of vanadium oxides is improved by electrode and electrolyte engineering and the cycling lifespan of vanadium oxides is increased from 1000 to 10&#160;000 cycles.








Abstract
Calcium&#8208;ion batteries (CIBs) have emerged as a promising alternative for electrochemical energy storage. The lack of high&#8208;performance cathode materials severely limits the development of CIBs. Vanadium oxides are particularly attractive as cathode materials for CIBs, and preinsertion chemistry is often used to improve their calcium storage performance. However, the room temperature cycling lifespan of vanadium oxides in organic electrolytes still falls short of 1000 cycles. Here, based on preinsertion chemistry, the cycling life of vanadium oxides is further improved by integrated electrode and electrolyte engineering. Utilizing a tailored Ca electrolyte, the constructed freestanding (NH4)2V6O16&#183;1.35H2O@graphene oxide@carbon nanotube (NHVO&#8208;H@GO@CNT) composite cathode achieves a 305 mAh g&#8722;1 high capacity and 10&#160;000 cycles record&#8208;long life. Additionally, for the first time, a Ca&#8208;ion hybrid capacitor full cell is assembled and delivers a capacity of 62.8 mAh g&#8722;1. The calcium storage mechanism of NHVO&#8208;H@GO@CNT based on a two&#8208;phase reaction and the exchange of NH4+ and Ca2+ during cycling are revealed. The lattice self&#8208;regulation of V&#9472;O layers is observed and the layered vanadium oxides with Ca2+ pillars formed by ion exchange exhibit higher capacity. This work provides novel strategies to enhance the calcium storage performance of vanadium oxides via integrated structural design of electrodes and electrolyte modification.

         <title>Single&#8208;Step Control of Liquid&#8211;Liquid Crystalline Phase Separation by Depletion Gradients</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different sizes of nanoparticles with concentration gradients control the liquid&#8211;liquid crystalline phase separation (LLCPS) speed and induce different morphologies of tactoids with positional order. Nanoparticles can be templated by LLCPS via size selectivity effects inside and on the surface of tactoids, enabling unprecedented spatial characterization of the structure of the tactoids.








Abstract
Fine&#8208;tuning nucleation and growth of colloidal liquid crystalline (LC) droplets, also known as tactoids, is highly desirable in both fundamental science and technological applications. However, the tactoid structure results from the trade&#8208;off between thermodynamics and nonequilibrium kinetics effects, and controlling liquid&#8211;liquid crystalline phase separation (LLCPS) in these systems is still a work in progress. Here, a single&#8208;step strategy is introduced to obtain a rich palette of morphologies for tactoids formed via nucleation and growth within an initially isotropic phase exposed to a gradient of depletants. The simultaneous appearance is shown of rich LC structures along the depleting potential gradient, where the position of each LC structure is correlated with the magnitude of the depleting potential. Changing the size (nanoparticles) or the nature (polymers) of the depleting agent provides additional, precise control over the resulting LC structures through a size&#8208;selective mechanism, where the depletant may be found both within and outside the LC droplets. The use of depletion gradients from depletants of varying sizes and nature offers a powerful toolbox for manipulation, templating, imaging, and understanding heterogeneous colloidal LC structures.

         <title>Autonomous Artificial Olfactory Sensor Systems with Homeostasis Recovery via a Seamless Neuromorphic Architecture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial olfactory sensor system capable of detecting gas accumulation via memory characteristics is investigated, all in a seamless architecture. The neuromorphic olfactory system exhibits excitatory action in response to NO2 gas, triggering an alarm at dangerous levels of gas adsorption. Furthermore, inhibitory properties from pulsed UV light are analyzed, demonstrating autonomous recovery that mimic the biological homeostasis function.








Abstract
Neuromorphic olfactory systems have been actively studied in recent years owing to their considerable potential in electronic noses, robotics, and neuromorphic data processing systems. However, conventional gas sensors typically have the ability to detect hazardous gas levels but lack synaptic functions such as memory and recognition of gas accumulation, which are essential for realizing human&#8208;like neuromorphic sensory system. In this study, a seamless architecture for a neuromorphic olfactory system capable of detecting and memorizing the present level and accumulation status of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) during continuous gas exposure, regulating a self&#8208;alarm implementation triggered after 147 and 85 s at a continuous gas exposure of 20 and 40&#160;ppm, respectively. Thin&#8208;film&#8208;transistor type gas sensors utilizing carbon nanotube semiconductors detect NO2 gas molecules through carrier trapping and exhibit long&#8208;term retention properties, which are compatible with neuromorphic excitatory applications. Additionally, the neuromorphic inhibitory performance is also characterized via gas desorption with programmable ultraviolet light exposure, demonstrating homeostasis recovery. These results provide a promising strategy for developing a facile artificial olfactory system that demonstrates complicated biological synaptic functions with a seamless and simplified system architecture.

         <title>Development of Electrolytes under Lean Condition in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Implementing lean electrolyte is a required condition to achieve high specific energy of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries at the cell level. This review analyzes the challenges induced by lean electrolyte condition focusing on the connection between polysulfide evolution pathways and fundamental solvation properties of the electrolytes. The working mechanisms and design principle of redox mediators and catalysts are also discussed.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries stand out as one of the promising candidates for next&#8208;generation electrochemical energy storage technologies. A key requirement to realize high&#8208;specific&#8208;energy Li&#8211;S batteries is to implement low amount of electrolyte, often characterized by the electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratio. Low E/S ratio aggravates the known challenges for Li&#8211;S batteries and introduces new ones originated from the high concentration of polysulfides in limited electrolyte reservoir. In this review, the connections between the fundamental properties of electrolytes and the electrochemical/chemical reactions in Li&#8211;S batteries under lean electrolyte condition are elucidated. The emphasis is on how the solvating properties of the electrolyte affect the fate of polysulfides.

&lt;p&gt;Implementing lean electrolyte is a required condition to achieve high specific energy of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries at the cell level. This review analyzes the challenges induced by lean electrolyte condition focusing on the connection between polysulfide evolution pathways and fundamental solvation properties of the electrolytes. The working mechanisms and design principle of redox mediators and catalysts are also discussed.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries stand out as one of the promising candidates for next-generation electrochemical energy storage technologies. A key requirement to realize high-specific-energy Li&#8211;S batteries is to implement low amount of electrolyte, often characterized by the electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratio. Low E/S ratio aggravates the known challenges for Li&#8211;S batteries and introduces new ones originated from the high concentration of polysulfides in limited electrolyte reservoir. In this review, the connections between the fundamental properties of electrolytes and the electrochemical/chemical reactions in Li&#8211;S batteries under lean electrolyte condition are elucidated. The emphasis is on how the solvating properties of the electrolyte affect the fate of polysulfides. Built upon the mechanistic analysis, different strategies to design lean electrolytes to improve the overall process of Li&#8211;S reactions and Li anode protection are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Solar&#8208;Driven Conversion of CO2 to C2 Products by the 3d Transition Metal Intercalates of Layered Lead Iodides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H5OH conversion is realized by tailoring the structure of layered lead iodide by coordination chemistry, introducing interlamellar redox&#8208;active Co2+/Ni2+ centers at the atomic&#8208;precision level. The heterobimetallic Pb&#8211;O&#8211;Co/Ni species are found to not only facilitate interlayer carrier transport, but also achieve charge&#8208;polarized active sites to promote C&#8211;C coupling.








Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction to high&#8208;value&#8208;added C2+ products presents significant challenges, which is attributed to the slow kinetics of multi&#8208;e&#8722; CO2 photoreduction and the high thermodynamic barrier for C&#8211;C coupling. Incorporating redox&#8208;active Co2+/Ni2+ cations into lead halide photocatalysts has high potentials to improve carrier transport and introduce charge polarized bimetallic sites, addressing the kinetic and thermodynamic issues, respectively. In this study, a coordination&#8208;driven synthetic strategy is developed to introduce 3d transition metals into the interlamellar region of layered organolead iodides with atomic precision. The resultant bimetallic halide hybrids exhibit selective photoreduction of CO2 to C2H5OH using H2O vapor at the evolution rates of 24.9&#8211;31.4&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 and high selectivity of 89.5&#8211;93.6%, while pristine layered lead iodide yields only C1 products. Band structure calculations and photoluminescence studies indicate that the interlayer Co2+/Ni2+ species greatly contribute to the frontier orbitals and enhance exciton dissociation into free carriers, facilitating carrier transport between adjacent lead iodide layers. In addition, Bader charge distribution calculations and in situ experimental spectroscopic studies reveal that the asymmetric Ni&#8211;O&#8211;Pb bimetallic catalytic sites exhibit intrinsic charge polarization, promoting C&#8211;C coupling and leading to the formation of the key *OC&#8211;CHO intermediate.

         <title>Ultrasmall Inorganic Mesoporous Nanoparticles: Preparation, Functionalization, and Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrasmall inorganic mesoporous nanoparticles (&lt;50&#160;nm) are a unique type of porous nanomaterial with numerous advantages, involving abundant mesopores, low density, high specific surface area, multiple reaction sites, and small size effect, which have been widely used in multiple applications, such as catalysis, energy storage, and drug delivery.








Abstract
Ultrasmall mesoporous nanoparticles (&lt;50&#160;nm), a unique porous nanomaterial, have been widely studied in many fields in the last decade owing to the abundant advantages, involving rich mesopores, low density, high surface area, numerous reaction sites, large cavity space, ultrasmall size, etc. This paper presents a review of recent advances in the preparation, functionalization, and applications of ultrasmall inorganic mesoporous nanoparticles for the first time. The soft monomicelles&#8208;directed method, in contrast to the hard&#8208;template and template&#8208;free methods, is more flexible in the synthesis of mesoporous nanoparticles. This is because the amphiphilic micelle has tunable functional blocks, controlled molecule masses, configurations and mesostructures. Focus on the soft micelle directing method, monomicelles could be classified into four types, i.e., the Pluronic&#8208;type block copolymer monomicelles, laboratory&#8208;synthesized amphiphilic block copolymers monomicelles, the single&#8208;molecule star&#8208;shaped block copolymer monomicelles, and the small&#8208;molecule anionic/cationic surfactant monomicelles. This paper also reviews the functionalization of the inner mesopores and the outer surfaces, which includes constructing the yolkshell structures (encapsulated nanoparticles), anchoring the active components packed on the shell and building an asymmetric Janus architecture. Then, several representative applications, involving catalysis, energy storage, and biomedicines are presented. Finally, the prospects and challenges of controlled synthesis and large&#8208;scale applications of ultrasmall mesoporous nanoparticles in the future are foreseen.

         <title>Tunable Negative and Positive Photoconductance in Van Der Waals Heterostructure for Image Preprocessing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the negative and positive photoconductance effects conversion and the dark current suppression are realized by applying various laser power densities on a graphene/InSe/h&#8208;BN heterojunction&#8208;based FET. In addition, a modified photocurrent model as a function of laser power density is proposed to describe both negative and positive photoconductance effects. Finally, the van der Waals heterostructure is successfully applied to the image preprocessing.








Abstract
The processing of visual information occurs mainly in the retina, and the retinal preprocessing function greatly improves the transmission quality and efficiency of visual information. The artificial retina system provides a promising path to efficient image processing. Here, graphene/InSe/h&#8208;BN heterogeneous structure is proposed, which exhibits negative and positive photoconductance (NPC and PPC) effects by altering the strength of a single wavelength laser. Moreover, a modified theoretical model is presented based on the power&#8208;dependent photoconductivity effect of laser: Iph=&#8722;mP&#945;1+nP&#945;2${\rm I}_{\rm ph}\,=\,-{\rm mP}^{\alpha _{1}} + {\rm nP}^{\alpha _{2}}$, which can reveal the internal physical mechanism of negative/positive photoconductance effects. The present 2D structure design allows the field effect transistor (FET) to exhibit excellent photoelectric performance (RNPC&#160;=&#160;1.1&#215; 104&#160;AW&#8722;1, RPPC&#160;=&#160;13&#160;AW&#8722;1) and performance stability. Especially, the retinal pretreatment process is successfully simulated based on the negative and positive photoconductive effects. Moreover, the pulse signal input improves the device responsivity by 167%, and the transmission quality and efficiency of the visual signal can also be enhanced. This work provides a new design idea and direction for the construction of artificial vision, and lay a foundation for the integration of the next generation of optoelectronic&#160;devices.

         <title>Black Phosphorus Nanosheets Protect Neurons by Degrading Aggregative &#945;&#8208;syn and Clearing ROS in Parkinson's Disease</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#945;&#8208;syn is an important target in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). The study finds that black phosphorus nanosheets (BPNSs) degrade &#945;&#8208;syn aggregates by directly binding &#945;&#8208;syn and activating autophagy. In addition, BPNSs can also protect mitochondria and clear reactive oxygen species, thereby protecting neuronal cells and treating Parkinson's disease. Further, BPNSs are able to cross the blood&#8211;brain barrier and treat PD model mice in vivo.








Abstract
Although evidence indicates that the abnormal accumulation of &#945;&#8208;synuclein (&#945;&#8208;syn) in dopamine neurons of the substantia nigra is the main pathological feature of Parkinson's disease (PD), no compounds that have both &#945;&#8208;syn antiaggregation and &#945;&#8208;syn degradation functions have been successful in treating the disease in the clinic. Here, it is shown that black phosphorus nanosheets (BPNSs) interact directly with &#945;&#8208;syn fibrils to trigger their disaggregation for PD treatment. Moreover, BPNSs have a specific affinity for &#945;&#8208;syn through van der Waals forces. And BPNSs are found to activate autophagy to maintain &#945;&#8208;syn homeostasis, improve mitochondrial dysfunction, reduce reactive oxygen species levels, and rescue neuronal death and synaptic loss in PC12 cells. It is also observed that BPNSs penetrate the blood&#8211;brain barrier and protect against dopamine neuron loss, alleviating behavioral disorders in 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,2,3,6&#8208;tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) induced mouse model and hA53T &#945;&#8208;syn transgenic mice. Together, the study reveals that BPNSs have the potential as a novel integrated nanomedicine for clinical diagnosis and treatment of neurological diseases.

         <title>A Lead&#8208;Free Ferroelectric 2D Dion&#8211;Jacobson Tin Iodide Perovskite</title>

         <dc:description>
New lead&#8208;free 2D Dion&#8211;Jacobson tin perovskites containing the 4&#8208;(aminomethyl)piperidinium (4AMP) spacer cation are studied: (4AMP)SnI4, (4AMP)(MA)Sn2I7, and (4AMP)(FA)Sn2I7 (MA = methylammonium, FA = formamidinium). Structural analysis reveals that only (4AMP)SnI4 is noncentrosymmetric, confirmed by second harmonic generation. Ferroelectric hysteresis measurements provide clear evidence of ferroelectricity of (4AMP)SnI4 at room temperature with spontaneous polarization of 10.0 &#181;C cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
2D hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic halide perovskites emerge as a new class of 2D semiconductors with the potential to combine excellent optoelectronic properties with symmetry&#8208;enabled properties such as ferroelectricity. Although many lead&#8208;based ferroelectric 2D halide perovskites are reported, there is yet to be a conclusive report of ferroelectricity in tin&#8208;based 2D perovskites. Here, the structures and properties of a new series of 2D Dion&#8211;Jacobson (DJ) Sn perovskites: (4AMP)SnI4, (4AMP)(MA)Sn2I7, and (4AMP)(FA)Sn2I7 (4AMP = 4&#8208;(aminomethyl)piperidinium, MA = methylammonium, and FA = formamidinium), are reported. Structural characterization reveals that (4AMP)SnI4 is polar with in&#8208;plane spontaneous polarization whereas (4AMP)(MA)Sn2I7 and (4AMP)(FA)Sn2I7 are centrosymmetric. Further, (4AMP)SnI4 displays second harmonic generation (SHG) and polarization&#8208;electric field hysteresis measurements confirm it is ferroelectric with a spontaneous polarization of 10.0 &#181;C cm&#8722;2 at room temperature. (4AMP)SnI4 transitions into a centrosymmetric structure above 367 K. As the first direct experimental observation of the spontaneous ferroelectric polarization of a Sn&#8208;based 2D hybrid perovskite, this work opens up environmentally friendly 2D tin halide perovskites for ferroelectricity and other physical property studies.

         <title>Lead Isolation and Capture in Perovskite Photovoltaics toward Eco&#8208;Friendly Commercialization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been developed rapidly in efficiency and stability in recent years, which can compete with silicon solar cells. However, an important obstacle to the commercialization of PSCs is the toxicity of lead ions (Pb2+) from water&#8208;soluble perovskites. The entry of free Pb2+ into organisms can will cause severe harm to humans, such as blood lead poisoning, organ failure, etc. Therefore, we report a &#8220;lead isolation&#8208;capture&#8221; dual detoxification strategy with calcium disodium edetate (EDTA Na&#8208;Ca), which can inhibit lead leakage from PSCs under extreme conditions. More importantly, leaked lead exists in a nontoxic aggregation state chelated by EDTA. For the first time, in vivo experiments were conducted in mice to systematically prove that this material has a significant inhibitory effect on the toxicity of perovskites. In addition, this strategy can further enhance device performance, enabling the optimized devices to achieve an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.19%. This innovative strategy is a major breakthrough in the research on the prevention of lead toxicity in PSCs.

         <title>Bi&#8208;interlayer Strategy for Modulating NiCoP&#8208;based Heterostructure toward High&#8208;performance Aqueous Energy Storage Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Nickel&#8208;cobalt (NiCo) phosphides (NCPs) possess high electrochemical activity, which makes them promising candidates for electrode materials in aqueous energy storage devices, such as supercapacitors and zinc batteries. However, the actual specific capacitance and rate capability of NCPs require further improvement, which can be achieved through reasonable heterostructural design and loading conditions of active materials on substrates. Herein, novel hierarchical Bi&#8208;NCP heterogeneous structures with built&#8208;in electric fields consisting of bismuth (Bi) interlayers (electrodeposited on carbon cloth (CC)) were designed and fabricated to ensure the formation of uniform high&#8208;load layered active materials for efficient charge and ion transport. The resulting CC/Bi&#8208;NCP electrodes showed a uniform, continuous, and high mass loading (&gt;3.5&#160;mg) with a superior capacitance reaching 1200 F&#8901;g&#8722;1 at 1 A&#8901;g&#8722;1 and 4129 mF&#8901;cm&#8722;2 at 1 mA&#8901;cm&#8722;2 combined with high&#8208;rate capability and durable cyclic stability. Moreover, assembled hybrid supercapacitors, supercapatteries, and alkaline zinc batteries constructed using these electrodes delivered high energy densities of 64.4, 81.8, and 319.1 Wh&#183;kg&#8722;1, respectively. Overall, the constructed NCPs with excellent aqueous energy storage performance are potential for the development of novel transition metal&#8208;based heterostructure electrodes for advanced energy devices.

         <title>Van der Waals Epitaxial Growth of Ultrathin Indium Antimonide on Arbitrary Substrates Through Low&#8208;thermal Budget</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
III&#8211;V semiconductors possess high mobility, high frequency response, and detection sensitivity, making them potentially attractive for beyond&#8208;silicon electronics applications. However, the traditional heteroepitaxy of III&#8211;V semiconductors is impeded by a significant lattice mismatch and the necessity for extreme vacuum and high temperature conditions due to the low saturated vapor pressures of their constituent metals, thereby impeding their in situ compatibility with flexible substrates and silicon&#8208;based circuits. In this study, we present a novel approach to fabricate ultrathin InSb single&#8208;crystal nanosheets on arbitrary substrates with a thickness as thin as 2.4&#160;nm using low&#8208;thermal&#8208;budget Van der Waals (vdW) epitaxy through chemical vapor deposition (CVD). In particular, we have successfully achieved in&#8208;situ growth on both silicon&#8208;based substrates and flexible polyimide substrates. Notably, the growth temperature required for InSb nanosheets (240&#160;&#176;C) is significantly lower than that employed in back&#8208;end&#8208;of&#8208;line processes (400&#160;&#176;C). The field effect transistor (FET) devices based on fabricated ultrathin InSb nanosheets exhibit ultra&#8208;high On&#8208;off ratio exceeding 108 and demonstrate minimal gate leakage currents. Furthermore, these ultrathin InSb nanosheet display p&#8208;type characteristics with hole mobilities reaching up to 203 cm2v&#8722;1s&#8722;1 at room temperatures. This study paves the way for achieving heterogeneous integration of III&#8211;V semiconductors, ensuring compatibility with existing integrated circuit architecture and facilitating their application in flexible electronics, thereby realizing the potential of III&#8211;V nanometer&#8208;scale logic transistors.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of Electrocatalysts Base on Catalysis&#8208;Unit Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
It is a pressing need to develop new energy materials to address the existing energy crisis. However, screening optimal targets out of thousands of materials candidates remains a great challenge. Herein, we propose and validate an alternative concept for highly effective materials screening based on dual&#8208;atom salphen catalysis units. Such an approach simplifies the design of catalytic materials and reforms the trial&#8208;and&#8208;error experimental model into a building&#8208;blocks&#8208;assembly like process. Firstly, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed on a series of potential catalysis units which were possible to synthesize. Then, machine learning (ML) was employed to define the structure&#8208;performance relationship and acquire chemical insights. Afterwards, the projected catalysis units were integrated into covalent organic frameworks (COFs) to validate the concept Electrochemical tests confirm that Ni&#8208;SalphenCOF and Co&#8208;SalphenCOF are promising conductive agent&#8208;free oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts. This work provides a fast&#8208;tracked strategy for design and development of functional materials, which serves as a potentially workable framework for seamlessly integrating DFT calculations, ML, and experimental approaches.

This work provides a fast-tracked strategy for design and development of functional materials, which serves as a potentially workable framework for seamlessly integrating DFT calculations, ML, and experimental approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

Abstract
The pursuit of constructing humanoid robots to replicate the anatomical structures and capabilities of human beings has been a long&#8208;standing significant undertaking and especially garnered tremendous attention in recent years. However, despite the progress made over recent decades, humanoid robots have predominantly been confined to those rigid metallic structures, which however starkly contrast with the inherent flexibility observed in biological systems. To better innovate this area, the present article systematically explores the value and potential of liquid metals and their derivatives in facilitating a crucial transition towards soft humanoid robots. Through a comprehensive interpretation of bionics, we present an overview of liquid metals&#8217; multifaceted roles as essential components in constructing advanced humanoid robots &#8211; functioning as soft actuators, sensors, power sources, logical devices, circuit systems, and even transformable skeletal structures. We conceived that the integration of these components with flexible structures, facilitated by the unique properties of liquid metals, can create unexpected versatile functionalities and behaviors to better fulfill human needs. Finally, we envision a revolution in humanoid robots, transitioning from metallic frameworks to hybrid soft&#8208;rigid structures resembling that of biological tissues. This article is expected to provide fundamental guidance for the coming research, thereby advancing the area.

         <title>Two&#8208;dimensional Hybrid Perovskites: from Static and Dynamic Structures to Potential Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskites have received great attention recently due to their structural tunability and environmental stability, making them highly promising candidates for various applications by breaking property bottlenecks that affect established materials. However, in 2D perovskites, the complicated interplay between organic spacers and inorganic slabs makes structural analysis challenging to interpret. A deeper understanding of the structure&#8208;property relationship in these systems is urgently needed to enable high&#8208;performance tunable optoelectronic devices. Herein, we examine how structural changes, from constant lattice distortion and variable structural evolution, modeled with both static and dynamic structural descriptors, affect macroscopic properties and ultimately device performance. We report the effect of chemical composition, crystallographic inhomogeneity, and mechanical&#8208;stress&#8208;induced static structural changes and corresponding electronic band variations. Additionally, the structure dynamics are described from the viewpoint of anharmonic vibrations, which impact electron&#8208;phonon coupling and the carriers&#8217; dynamic processes. Correlated carrier&#8208;matter interactions, known as polarons and acting on fine electronic structures, are then discussed. Finally, we propose reliable guidelines to facilitate design to exploit structural features and rationally achieve breakthroughs in 2D perovskite applications. This review provides a global structural landscape of 2D perovskites, expected to promote the prosperity of these materials in emerging device applications.

         <title>A Customized Biohybrid presenting Cascade Responses to Tumor Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Intrinsic characteristics of microorganisms, including non&#8208;specific metabolism sites, toxic byproducts and uncontrolled proliferation constrain their exploitation in medical applications such as tumor therapy. Here, we report an engineered biohybrid that can efficiently target cancerous sites through a pre&#8208;determined metabolic pathway to enable precise tumor ablation. In this system, DH5&#945; Escherichia coli is engineered by the introduction of hypoxia&#8208;inducible promoters and lactate oxidase genes, and further surface&#8208;armored with iron&#8208;doped ZIF&#8208;8 nanoparticles. This bioengineered E. coli can produce and secrete lactate oxidase to reduce lactate concentration in response to hypoxic tumor microenvironment, as well as triggering immune activation. The peroxidase&#8208;like functionality of the nanoparticles extends the end product of the lactate metabolism, enabling the conversion of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) into highly cytotoxic hydroxyl radicals. This, coupled with the transformation of tirapazamine loaded on nanoparticles to toxic benzotriazinyl, culminates in severe tumor cell ferroptosis. Intravenous injection of this biohybrid significantly inhibited tumor growth and metastasis.

         <title>A Rational Design of Bio&#8208;Derived Disulfide CANs for Wearable Capacitive Pressure Sensor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Classic approaches to integrate flexible capacitive sensor performance are to on&#8208;demand microstructing dielectric layers and to adjust dielectric material compositions via the introduction of insoluble carbon additives (to increase sensitivity) or dynamic interactions (to achieve self&#8208;healing). However, the sensor's enhanced performances often come with the increased material complexity, discouraging its circular economy. Herein, we introduce a new intrinsic self&#8208;healable, closed&#8208;loop recyclable dielectric layer material, a fully nature&#8208;derived dynamic covalent poly(disulfide) decorated with rich H bonding and metal&#8208;catechol complexations. The polymer network possesses a mechanically ductile character with an Arrhenius&#8208;like dependent viscoelasticity. The assembled capacitive pressure sensor is able to achieve a sensitivity up to 9.26 kPa&#8722;1, fast response/recovery times of 32/24&#160;ms, and could deliver consistent signals of continuous consecutive cycles even after being self&#8208;healed or closed&#8208;loop recycled for real&#8208;time detection of human motions. This is expected to be of high interest for current capacitive sensing research to move towards a life&#8208;like, high performance and circular economy direction.

         <title>High&#8208;Voltage Spinel Cathode Materials: Navigating the Structural Evolution for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
High&#8208;voltage LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO) spinel oxides are highly promising cobalt&#8208;free cathode materials to cater to the surging demand for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, commercial application of LNMOs is still challenging despite decades of research. To address the challenge, the understanding of their crystallography and structural evolutions during synthesis and electrochemical operation is critical. This review aims to illustrate and update the fundamentals of crystallography, phase transition mechanisms, and electrochemical behaviors of LNMOs. First, we outline the research history of LNMO and its development into a LIB cathode material. Then we review the structural basics of LNMOs including the classic and updated views of the crystal polymorphism, interconversion between the polymorphs, and structure&#8208;composition relationship. Afterwards, the phase transition mechanisms of LNMOs that connect structural and electrochemical properties are comprehensively discussed from fundamental thermodynamics to operando dynamics at intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;particle levels. In addition, phase evolutions during overlithiation as well as thermal&#8208;/electrochemical&#8208;driven phase transformations of LNMOs are also discussed. Finally, we offer recommendations for the further development of LNMOs as well as other complex materials to unlock their full potential for future sustainable and powerful batteries.

         <title>&#8220;Cloth&#8208;to&#8208;Clothes&#8208;Like&#8221; Fabrication of Soft Actuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Inspired by adaptive natural organisms and living matter, soft actuators appeal to a variety of innovative applications such as soft grippers, artificial muscles, wearable electronics, and biomedical devices. However, their fabrication is typically limited in laboratories or a few enterprises since specific instruments, strong stimuli, or specialized operation skills are inevitably involved. Here we propose a straightforward &#8220;cloth&#8208;to&#8208;clothes&#8208;like&#8221; method to prepare soft actuators with a low threshold by combining the hysteretic behavior of liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) with the exchange reaction of dynamic covalent bonds. Due to hysteretic behavior, the LCEs (resemble &#8220;cloth&#8221;) effectively retain predefined shapes after stretching and releasing for extended periods. Subsequently, the samples naturally become soft actuators (resemble &#8220;clothes&#8221;) via the exchange reaction at ambient temperatures. As a post&#8208;synthesis method, this strategy effectively separates the production of LCEs and soft actuators. LCEs can be mass&#8208;produced in bulk by factories or producers and stored as prepared, much like rolls of cloth. When required, these LCEs can be customized into soft actuators as needed. This strategy provides a robust, flexible, and scalable solution to engineering soft actuators, holding great promise for mass production and universal applications.

This strategy provides a robust, flexible, and scalable solution to engineering soft actuators, holding great promise for mass production and universal applications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>CVD Synthesis of Twisted Bilayer WS2 with Tunable Second Harmonic Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Twisted bilayer transitionmetal dichalcogenides provide a unique platform for investigating intriguing fundamental physical properties. A tilted SiO2/Si substrate is introduced into chemical vapordeposition to synthesize twisted bilayer WS2 with a wide twist angle range from 0&#176; to 120&#176;. The strong correlation between the SHG response and the twist angle suggests atunable SHG performance with twist angles.








Abstract
The introduction of rotational freedom by twist angles in twisted bilayer (TB) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) can tailor the inherent properties of the TMDCs, which provides a promising platform to investigate the exotic physical properties. However, direct synthesis of high&#8208;quality TB&#8208;TMDCs with full twist angles is significantly challenging due to the substantial energy barriers during crystal growth. Here, a modified chemical vapor deposition strategy is proposed to synthesize TB&#8208;WS2 with a wide twist angle range from 0&#176; to 120&#176;. Utilizing a tilted SiO2/Si substrate, a gas flow disturbance is generated in the furnace tube to create a heterogeneous concentration gradient of the metal precursor, which provides an extra driving force for the growth of TB&#8208;WS2. The Raman and photoluminescence results confirm a weak interlayer coupling of the TB&#8208;WS2. High&#8208;quality periodic Moir&#233; patterns are observed in the scanning transmission electron microscopy images. Moreover, owing to the strong correlation between the nonlinear optical response and the twisted crystal structure, tunable second harmonic generation behaviors are realized in the TB&#8208;WS2. This approach opens up a new avenue for the direct growth of high&#8208;crystalline&#8208;quality and pristine TB&#8208;TMDCs and their potential applications in nonlinear optical devices.

         <title>Probing Hyperbolic Shear Polaritons in &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 Nanostructures Using STEM&#8208;EELS</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hyperbolic shear polaritons are observed in &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 nanostructures using electron energy loss spectroscopy. The propagation and reflection of polariton modes are studied. The tunable broad spectral polaritons in &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 expand the scope of &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 from its application in traditional electronic devices to applications in nanophotonics and metamaterials.








Abstract
Phonon polaritons, quasiparticles arising from strong coupling between electromagnetic waves and optical phonons, have potential for applications in subdiffraction imaging, sensing, thermal conduction enhancement, and spectroscopy signal enhancement. A new class of phonon polaritons in low&#8208;symmetry monoclinic crystals, hyperbolic shear polaritons (HShPs), have been verified recently in &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 by free electron laser (FEL) measurements. However, detailed behaviors of HShPs in &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 nanostructures still remain unknown. Here, by using monochromatic electron energy loss spectroscopy in conjunction with scanning transmission electron microscopy, the experimental observation of multiple HShPs in &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 in the mid&#8208;infrared (MIR) and far&#8208;infrared (FIR) ranges is reported. HShPs in various &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 nanorods and a &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 nanodisk are excited. The frequency&#8208;dependent rotation and shear effect of HShPs reflect on the distribution of EELS signals. The propagation and reflection of HShPs in nanostructures are clarified by simulations of electric field distribution. These findings suggest that, with its tunable broad spectral HShPs, &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 is an excellent candidate for nanophotonic applications.

         <title>Enhanced Chemoradiotherapy for MRSA&#8208;Infected Osteomyelitis Using Immunomodulatory Polymer&#8208;Reinforced Nanotherapeutics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel nanoradiosensitizer with improved light penetration depth for enhanced chemoradiotherapy effect to reverse immunosuppression in the biofilm&#8208;caused poorly innate immunity area and to eliminate MRSA&#8208;infected deep&#8208;tissue infections. The polymer&#8208;reinforced nanotherapeutics in the rat osteomyelitis model verify that chemoradiotherapy expresses an excellent modality for deep&#8208;tissue infection management and a promising immunomodulatory treatment to enhance the therapeutic effects of bacterial infections.








Abstract
The eradication of osteomyelitis caused by methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) poses a significant challenge due to its development of biofilm&#8208;induced antibiotic resistance and impaired innate immunity, which often leads to frequent surgical failure. Here, the design, synthesis, and performance of X&#8208;ray&#8208;activated polymer&#8208;reinforced nanotherapeutics that modulate the immunological properties of infectious microenvironments to enhance chemoradiotherapy against multidrug&#8208;resistant bacterial deep&#8208;tissue infections are reported. Upon X&#8208;ray radiation, the proposed polymer&#8208;reinforced nanotherapeutic generates reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species. To robustly eradicate MRSA biofilms at deep infection sites, these species can specifically bind to MRSA and penetrate biofilms for enhanced chemoradiotherapy treatment. X&#8208;ray&#8208;activated nanotherapeutics modulate the innate immunity of macrophages to prevent the recurrence of osteomyelitis. The remarkable anti&#8208;infection effects of these nanotherapeutics are validated using a rat osteomyelitis model. This study demonstrates the significant potential of a synergistic chemoradiotherapy and immunotherapy method for treating MRSA biofilm&#8208;infected osteomyelitis.

         <title>Probing the Strain Direction&#8208;Dependent Nonmonotonic Optical Bandgap Modulation of Layered Violet Phosphorus</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonmonotonic optical bandgap modulation is proven to exist in violet phosphorus nanosheets by photoluminescence, and the modulation rates enter a good agreement with the theoretical values. The underlying mechanism is clarified by first&#8208;principle calculations that the strain&#8208;induced asymmetric distribution of conduction band minimum wavefunctions plays a crucial role in the nonmonotonic modulation. 








Abstract
Recent theoretical investigations have well&#8208;predicted strain&#8208;induced nonmonotonic optical band gap variations in low&#8208;dimensional materials. However, few two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials are experimentally confirmed to exhibit nonmonotonic optical band gap variation under varying strain. Here, a strain&#8208;induced nonmonotonic optical bandgap variation in violet phosphorus (VP) nanosheets is observed, as evidenced by photoluminescence spectroscopy, which is reported in a few other 2D materials in knowledge. The optical bandgap variations are characterized to show the modulation rates of 41 and &#8722;24 meV/% with compression and tensile strains, respectively. Remarkably, first&#8208;principle calculations predict and clarify the nonmonotonic modulation accurately, highlighting its relationship with the strain direction&#8208;dependent asymmetric distribution of conduction band minimum wavefunctions, demonstrating that this unique nonmonotonic optical bandgap modulation is determined by the distinctive crystal structure of VP. This work provides a deep insight into the design of 2D materials toward optoelectronic and photoelectrochemical applications via strain engineering.

Black phosphorus&#8208;methylene blue (BP&#8208;MB) is continuously released from intranasal BP&#8208;MB@Gel and delivered to the brain, exerting synergistic therapeutic effects by suppressing tau neuropathology, restoring mitochondrial function, and alleviating the neuroinflammation, thus inducing cognitive improvements in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). These findings highlight a potential strategy for brain&#8208;targeted drug delivery in the management of the complex pathologies of AD.









Abstract
The accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein aggregates is a key pathogenic event in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and induces mitochondrial dysfunction and reactive oxygen species overproduction. However, the treatment of AD remains challenging owning to the hindrance caused by the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) and the complex pathology of AD. Nasal delivery represents an effective means of circumventing the BBB and delivering drugs to the brain. In this study, black phosphorus (BP) is used as a drug carrier, as well as an antioxidant, and loaded with a tau aggregation inhibitor, methylene blue (MB), to obtain BP&#8208;MB. For intranasal (IN) delivery, a thermosensitive hydrogel is fabricated by cross&#8208;linking carboxymethyl chitosan and aldehyde Pluronic F127 (F127&#8208;CHO) micelles. The BP&#8208;MB nanocomposite is incorporated into the hydrogel to obtain BP&#8208;MB@Gel. BP&#8208;MB@Gel could be injected intranasally, providing high nasal mucosal retention and controlled drug release. After IN administration, BP&#8208;MB is continuously released and delivered to the brain, exerting synergistic therapeutic effects by suppressing tau neuropathology, restoring mitochondrial function, and alleviating neuroinflammation, thus inducing cognitive improvements in mouse models of AD. These findings highlight a potential strategy for brain&#8208;targeted drug delivery in the management of the complex pathologies of AD.

         <title>Dibromomethane Knitted Highly Porous Hyper&#8208;Cross&#8208;Linked Polymers for Efficient High&#8208;Pressure Methane Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultra&#8208;high porous SHCP&#8208;3&#8208;Br, synthesized via a slow&#8208;knitting method using DBM as both solvent and cross&#8208;linker under low dosage of an AlCl3 catalyst, exhibits the highest surface area among the reported HCPs and an impressive performance in high&#8208;pressure methane storage and delivery, which provides a feasible and efficient approach for the scalable production of high&#8208;porosity HCPs with a dynamic&#8208;level control.








Abstract
Hyper&#8208;cross&#8208;linked polymers (HCPs) with ultra&#8208;high porosity, superior physicochemical stability, and excellent cost&#8208;effectiveness are attractive candidates for methane storage. However, the construction of HCPs with BET surface areas exceeding 3000 m2 g&#8722;1 remains extremely challenging. In this work, a newly developed DBM&#8208;knitting method with a slow&#8208;knitting rate is employed to increase the cross&#8208;linking degree, in which dichloromethane (DCM) is replaced by dibromomethane (DBM) as both solvent and electrophilic cross&#8208;linker, resulting in highly porous and physicochemically stable HCPs. The BET surface areas of DBM&#8208;knitted SHCPs&#8208;Br are 44%&#8211;120% higher than that of DCM&#8208;knitted SHCPs&#8208;Cl using the same building blocks. Remarkably, SHCP&#8208;3&#8208;Br exhibits an unprecedentedly high porosity (SBET = 3120&#160;m2&#160;g&#8722;1) among reported HCPs, and shows a competitive volumetric 5&#8211;100&#160;bar working methane capacity of 191 cm3 (STP) cm&#8722;3 at 273&#160;K calculated by using real packing density, which outperforms sate&#8208;of&#8208;art metal&#8208;organic framework (MOFs) at comparable conditions. This facile and versatile low&#8208;knitting&#8208;rate strategy enables effective improvement in the porosity of HCPs for porosity&#8208;desired applications.

         <title>Triphenylamine Spirofunctionalized Light&#8208;Emitting Conjugated Polymer with an Ultradeep&#8208;Blue Narrowband Emission for Large&#8208;Area Printed Display</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>

Large&#8208;area blade&#8208;coated ultradeep&#8208;blue polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs) are fabricated based on triphenylamine spirofunctionalized polydiarylfluorenes (POPSAF). POPSAF present a&#160;stable narrowband emissionand good charge transport behavior. Large&#8208;area printed PLEDs are constructed with an uniform emission of full width at half maximum &#8776;36&#160;nm and a Commission internationale de l&#8217;&#233;clairage of (0.155, 0.072) for preliminary passive matrix PLED display.








Abstract
Emerging printed large&#8208;area polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs) are essential for manufacturing flat&#8208;panel displays and solid lighting devices. However, it is challenging to obtain large&#8208;area and stable ultradeep&#8208;blue PLEDs because of the lack of light&#8208;emitting conjugated polymers (LCPs) with robust deep&#8208;blue emissions, excellent morphological stabilities, and high charging abilities. Here, a novel unsymmetrically substituted polydiarylfluorene (POPSAF) is obtained with stable narrowband emission for large&#8208;area printed displays via triphenylamine (TPA) spirofunctionalization of LCPs. POPSAF films show narrowband and stable ultradeep&#8208;blue emission with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 36&#160;nm, associated with their intrachain excitonic behavior without obvious polaron formation. Compared to controlled poly[4&#8208;(octyloxy)&#8208;9,9&#8208;diphenylfluoren&#8208;2,7&#8208;diyl]&#8208;co&#8208;[5&#8208;(octyloxy)&#8208;9,9&#8208;diphenylfluoren&#8208;2,7&#8208;diyl] (PODPF), excellent charge transport is observed in the POPSAF films because of the intrinsic hole transport ability of the TPA units. Large&#8208;area PLEDs are fabricated via blade&#8208;coating with an emission area of 9 cm2, which exhibit uniform ultradeep&#8208;blue emission with an FWHM of 36&#160;nm and corresponding Commission internationale de l&#8217;&#233;clairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.155, 0.072). These findings are attributed to the synergistic effects of robust emission, stable morphology, and printing capacity. Finally, preliminary printed passive matrix (PM) PLED displays with 20 &#215; 20 pixels monochromes are fabricated, confirmed the effectiveness of spirofunctionalization in optoelectronics.

         <title>Peptide&#8208;Driven Proton Sponge Nano&#8208;Assembly for Imaging and Triggering Lysosome&#8208;Regulated Immunogenic Cancer Cell Death</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proton sponge nano&#8208;assembly (PSNA) is optimized with self&#8208;assembly dependent fluorescence, positive charge density, and cell cytotoxicity. PSNA triggers immunogenic cell death (e.g., pyroptosis and necroptosis) of tumor cells, followed by the release of tumor&#8208;associated antigens, danger&#8208;associated molecular patterns, and pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines and the stimulation of dendritic cells by these molecules.








Abstract
Triggering lysosome&#8208;regulated immunogenic cell death (ICD, e.g., pyroptosis and necroptosis) with nanomedicines is an emerging approach for turning an &#8220;immune&#8208;cold&#8221; tumor &#8220;hot&#8221;&#8212;a key challenge faced by cancer immunotherapies. Proton sponge such as high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight branched polyethylenimine (PEI) is excellent at rupturing lysosomes, but its therapeutic application is hindered by uncontrollable toxicity due to fixed charge density and poor understanding of resulted cell death mechanism. Here, a series of proton sponge nano&#8208;assemblies (PSNAs) with self&#8208;assembly controllable surface charge density and cell cytotoxicity are created. Such PSNAs are constructed via low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight branched PEI covalently bound to self&#8208;assembling peptides carrying tetraphenylethene pyridinium (PyTPE, an aggregation&#8208;induced emission&#8208;based luminogen). Assembly of PEI assisted by the self&#8208;assembling peptide&#8208;PyTPE leads to enhanced surface positive charges and cell cytotoxicity of PSNA. The self&#8208;assembly tendency of PSNAs is further optimized by tuning hydrophilic and hydrophobic components within the peptide, thus resulting in the PSNA with the highest fluorescence, positive surface charge density, cell uptake, and cancer cell cytotoxicity. Systematic cell death mechanistic studies reveal that the lysosome rupturing&#8208;regulated pyroptosis and necroptosis are at least two causes of cell death. Tumor cells undergoing PSNA&#8208;triggered ICD activate immune cells, suggesting the great potential of PSNAs to trigger anticancer immunity.

         <title>Dislodgement of Hydrogen Bubbles in Microchannels with Embedded Pillars: An Analytical, Experimental, and Numerical Study</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insights into the fundamental behavior, forces, and interactions between entrapped gas bubbles and microchannels are provided. These microchannels include porous structures at the low&#8208;micrometer scale. Here, analytical, experimental, and numerical investigations are employed to present balanced and unbalanced conditions for gas bubble interfaces. This enables, in specific cases, bubble dislodgment at low pressure loads while enhancing the surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio.








Abstract
Microchannels with integrated pillars have enhanced the production capabilities and performance of various applications due to their high surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio. However, emerging gas bubbles can become trapped, potentially limiting the functionality or efficiency of the device when scaled down to the low&#8208;micrometer scale. Understanding the conditions required to dislodge these bubbles is thus critical for optimizing microfluidic devices with complex physical behaviors. Here an analytical model is presented that outlines the dislodgment conditions and driving forces for such gas&#8211;liquid flows. These terms are derived from the gas&#8211;liquid interface properties, geometry, and processing parameters. As the density of the pillar arrangement is scaled down, the resistance to bubble dislodgment typically increases. Nevertheless, the bubble is compelled to dislodge at lower pressure loads when critical volumes are reached. This newly discovered effect is particularly noticeable in densely packed arrays and can be explained by the interplay of increased surface tension, geometrical restrictions, and volume&#8208;preserving forces. The analytical terms and effects are validated through novel experimental and numerical methods tailored for microchannels in the low&#8208;micrometer scale, showing strong agreement.

         <title>2D Lateral Heterojunction Arrays with Tailored Interface Band Bending</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports on a new strategy, using semiconducting monolayers of Si2Te2 and Sb2Te3, for the epitaxial growth of high&#8208;density lateral heterojunction arrays with tunable interfacial band alignment. Scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy measurements demonstrate the continuous lattice of the two&#8208;dimensional&#160;Si2Te2/Sb2Te3 lateral heterojunctions and directly reveal the tailored type&#8208;II band bending at the interface.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) lateral heterojunction arrays, characterized by well&#8208;defined electronic interfaces, hold significant promise for advancing next&#8208;generation electronic devices. Despite this potential, the efficient synthesis of high&#8208;density lateral heterojunctions with tunable interfacial band alignment remains a challenging. Here, a novel strategy is reported for the fabrication of lateral heterojunction arrays between monolayer Si2Te2 grown on Sb2Te3 (ML&#8208;Si2Te2@Sb2Te3) and one&#8208;quintuple&#8208;layer Sb2Te3 grown on monolayer Si2Te2 (1QL&#8208;Sb2Te3@ML&#8208;Si2Te2) on a p&#8208;doped Sb2Te3 substrate. The site&#8208;specific formation of numerous periodically arranged 2D ML&#8208;Si2Te2@Sb2Te3/1QL&#8208;Sb2Te3@ML&#8208;Si2Te2 lateral heterojunctions is realized solely through three epitaxial growth steps of thick&#8208;Sb2Te3, ML&#8208;Si2Te2, and 1QL&#8208;Sb2Te3 films, sequentially. More importantly, the precisely engineering of the interfacial band alignment is realized, by manipulating the substrate's p&#8208;doping effect with lateral spatial dependency, on each ML&#8208;Si2Te2@Sb2Te3/1QL&#8208;Sb2Te3@ML&#8208;Si2Te2 junction. Atomically sharp interfaces of the junctions with continuous lattices are observed by scanning tunneling microscopy. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements directly reveal the tailored type&#8208;II band bending at the interface. This reported strategy opens avenues for advancing lateral epitaxy technology, facilitating practical applications of 2D in&#8208;plane heterojunctions.

         <title>Selective Organ&#8208;Targeting Hafnium Oxide Nanoparticles with Multienzyme&#8208;Mimetic Activities Attenuate Radiation&#8208;Induced Tissue Damage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Commonly known as radioenhancers, HfO2 nanoparticles reported in the study present surprising radioprotection in mice and rabbits, along with selective organ&#8208;targeting through fine&#8208;tuned synthesis. These multienzyme&#8208;mimicking agents can be visualized by spectral computed tomography with improved half&#8208;life and stability over amifostine. The protective mechanisms involve inhibiting DNA damage and inflammation and attenuating activated FoxO, Hippo, TNF, and MAPK interactive cascades.








Abstract
Radioprotective agents hold clinical promises to counteract off&#8208;target adverse effects of radiation and benefit radiotherapeutic outcomes, yet the inability to control drug transport in human organs poses a leading limitation. Based upon a validated rank&#8208;based multigene signature model, radiosensitivity indices are evaluated of diverse normal organs as a genomic predictor of radiation susceptibility. Selective ORgan&#8208;Targeting (SORT) hafnium oxide nanoparticles (HfO2 NPs) are rationally designed via modulated synthesis by &#945;&#8208;lactalbumin, homing to top vulnerable organs. HfO2 NPs like Hensify are commonly radioenhancers, but SORT HfO2 NPs exhibit surprising radioprotective effects dictated by unfolded ligands and Hf(0)/Hf(IV) redox couples. Still, the X&#8208;ray attenuation patterns allow radiological confirmation in target organs by dual&#8208;beam spectral computed tomography. SORT HfO2 NPs present potent antioxidant activities, catalytically scavenge reactive oxygen species, and mimic multienzyme catalytic activities. Consequently, SORT NPs rescue radiation&#8208;induced DNA damage in mouse and rabbit models and provide survival benefits upon lethal exposures. In addition to inhibiting radiation&#8208;induced mitochondrial apoptosis, SORT NPs impede DNA damage and inflammation by attenuating activated FoxO, Hippo, TNF, and MAPK interactive cascades. A universal methodology is proposed to reverse radioenhancers into radioprotectors. SORT radioprotective agents with image guidance are envisioned as compelling in personalized shielding from radiation deposition.

         <title>Enhancing CAR Macrophage Efferocytosis Via Surface Engineered Lipid Nanoparticles Targeting LXR Signaling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research introduces a novel approach to address efferocytosis disruption in atherosclerosis. Chimeric antigen receptor macrophages are engineered to target and engulf resistant apoptotic cells, with reactive oxygen species responsive nanoparticles enhancing their efficacy. This innovative cell therapy platform shows promise in promoting lipid efflux and reducing inflammation, offering the potential for advanced cardiovascular disease treatments.








Abstract
The removal of dying cells, or efferocytosis, is an indispensable part of resolving inflammation. However, the inflammatory microenvironment of the atherosclerotic plaque frequently affects the biology of both apoptotic cells and resident phagocytes, rendering efferocytosis dysfunctional. To overcome this problem, a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) macrophage that can target and engulf phagocytosis&#8208;resistant apoptotic cells expressing CD47 is developed. In both normal and inflammatory circumstances, CAR macrophages exhibit activity equivalent to antibody blockage. The surface of CAR macrophages is modified with reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive therapeutic nanoparticles targeting the liver X receptor pathway to improve their cell effector activities. The combination of CAR and nanoparticle engineering activated lipid efflux pumps enhances cell debris clearance and reduces inflammation. It is further suggested that the undifferentiated CAR&#8208;Ms can transmigrate within a mico&#8208;fabricated vessel system. It is also shown that our CAR macrophage can act as a chimeric switch receptor (CSR) to withstand the immunosuppressive inflammatory environment. The developed platform has the potential to contribute to the advancement of next&#8208;generation cardiovascular disease therapies and further studies include in vivo experiments.

         <title>Enhanced CO2 Electrolysis Through Mn Substitution Coupled with Ni Exsolution in Lanthanum Calcium Titanate Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>

Perovskite oxides La0.3Ca0.6Ni0.05MnxTi0.95&#8722;xO3&#8722;&#947; are investigated as potential solid oxide electrolysis cell cathode materials. Their electrocatalytic activity toward CO2 reduction is enhanced through the exsolution Ni nanoparticles enhanced by electrochemical poling and coupled with Mn codoping. Mn dopants enable more flexible coordination, facilitating oxygen ion migration resulting in more Ni nanoparticles and improved adsorption, desorption, and dissociation of CO2 molecules.








Abstract
In this study, perovskite oxides La0.3Ca0.6Ni0.05MnxTi0.95&#8722;xO3&#8722;&#947; (x = 0, 0.05, 0.10) are investigated as potential solid oxide electrolysis cell cathode materials. The catalytic activity of these cathodes toward CO2 reduction reaction is significantly enhanced through the exsolution of highly active Ni nanoparticles, driven by applying a current of 1.2 A in 97% CO2 &#8211; 3% H2O. The performance of La0.3Ca0.6Ni0.05Ti0.95O3&#8722;&#947; is notably improved by co&#8208;doping with Mn. Mn dopants enhance the reducibility of Ni, a crucial factor in promoting the in situ exsolution of metallic nanocatalysts in perovskite (ABO3) structures. This improvement is attributed to Mn dopants enabling more flexible coordination, resulting in higher oxygen vacancy concentration, and facilitating oxygen ion migration. Consequently, a higher density of Ni nanoparticles is formed. These oxygen vacancies also improve the adsorption, desorption, and dissociation of CO2 molecules. The dual doping strategy provides enhanced performance without degradation observed after 133&#160;h of high&#8208;temperature operation, suggesting a reliable cathode material for CO2 electrolysis.

         <title>Polymorphic Self&#8208;Assembly with Procedural Flexibility for Monodisperse Quaternary Protein Structures of DegQ Enzymes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
As smart building blocks, proteins can create quaternary structures in polymorphic configurations determined by soft clients. In the present study, highly monodisperse, one&#8208;way clustering is programmed by the protomer, DegQ, featuring procedural flexibility in the self&#8208;assembly procedure. First high&#8208;resolution cryo&#8208;EM structures of DegQ are presented, validating the feasibility and flexibility of programming proteins with native robot&#8208;like functions.








Abstract
As large molecular tertiary structures, some proteins can act as small robots that find, bind, and chaperone target protein clients, showing the potential to serve as smart building blocks in self&#8208;assembly fields. Instead of using such intrinsic functions, most self&#8208;assembly methodologies for proteins aim for de novo&#8208;designed structures with accurate geometric assemblies, which can limit procedural flexibility. Here, a strategy enabling polymorphic clustering of quaternary proteins, exhibiting simplicity and flexibility of self&#8208;assembling paths for proteins in forming monodisperse quaternary cage particles is presented. It is proposed that the enzyme protomer DegQ, previously solved at low resolution, may potentially be usable as a threefold symmetric building block, which can form polyhedral cages incorporated by the chaperone action of DegQ in the presence of protein clients. To obtain highly monodisperse cage particles, soft, and hence, less resistive client proteins, which can program the inherent chaperone activity of DegQ to efficient formations of polymorphic cages, depending on the size of clients are utilized. By reconstructing the atomic resolution cryogenic electron microscopy DegQ structures using obtained 12&#8208; and 24&#8208;meric clusters, the polymorphic clustering of DegQ enzymes is validated in terms of soft and rigid domains, which will provide effective routes for protein self&#8208;assemblies with procedural flexibility.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Construction of Articular Cartilage&#8208;Like Hydrogel Coating for Durable Aqueous Lubrication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A three&#8208;in&#8208;one strategy is developed for constructing an articular cartilage&#8208;like hydrogel coating on the surface of ultra&#8208;high molecular weight polyethylene, which exhibits an ultralow friction coefficient of 0.0048 during 10&#160;000 cycles under a load of 0.9&#160;MPa, and thus has important implications for development of biological lubricating materials.








Abstract
Articular cartilage has an appropriate multilayer structure and superior tribological properties and provides a structural paradigm for design of lubricating materials. However, mimicking articular cartilage traits on prosthetic materials with durable lubrication remains a huge challenge. Herein, an ingenious three&#8208;in&#8208;one strategy is developed for constructing an articular cartilage&#8208;like bilayer&#160;hydrogel coating on the surface of ultra&#8208;high molecular weight polyethylene (BH&#8208;UPE), which makes full use of conceptions of interfacial interlinking, high&#8208;entanglement crosslinking, and interface&#8208;modulated polymerization. The hydrogel coating is tightly interlinked with UPE substrate through hydrogel&#8208;UPE interchain entanglement and bonding. The hydrogel chains are highly entangled with each other to form a dense tough layer with negligible hysteresis for load&#8208;bearing by reducing the amounts of crosslinker and hydrophilic initiator to p.p.m. levels.&#160;Meanwhile, the polymerization of monomers in the top surface region is suppressed via interface&#8208;modulated polymerization, thus introducing a porous&#160;surface for effective aqueous lubrication. As a result, BH&#8208;UPE exhibits an ultralow friction coefficient of 0.0048 during 10&#160;000 cycles under a load of 0.9&#160;MPa, demonstrating great potential as an advanced bearing material for disc prosthesis. This work may provide a new way to build stable bilayer coatings and have important implications for development of biological lubricating materials.

         <title>Ferredoxin&#8208;Inspired Design of S&#8208;Synergized Fe&#8211;Fe Dual&#8208;Metal Center Catalysts for Enhanced Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, iron&#8208;based dual&#8208;metal center catalysts are strategically designed and fabricated by mimicking ferredoxin, in which additional Fe and S sites are synchronously installed near the single Fe sites as the &#8220;dual modulators&#8221; for precise modulation of the electronic structure. Thereby, balancing the adsorption/desorption behavior of the reaction intermediates, and accelerating the overall reaction kinetics.








Abstract
Dual&#8208;metal center catalysts (DMCs) have shown the ability to enhance the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) owing to their distinctive structural configurations. However, the precise modulation of electronic structure and the in&#8208;depth understanding of synergistic mechanisms between dual metal sites of DMCs at the atomic level remain challenging. Herein, mimicking the ferredoxin, Fe&#8208;based DMCs (Fe2N6&#8208;S) are strategically designed and fabricated, in which additional Fe and S sites are synchronously installed near the Fe sites and serve as &#8220;dual modulators&#8221; for coarse&#8208; and fine&#8208;tuning of the electronic modulation, respectively. The as&#8208;prepared Fe2N6&#8208;S catalyst exhibits enhanced ORR activity and outstanding Zinc&#8208;air (Zn&#8211;air) battery performance compared to the conventional single Fe site catalysts. The theoretical and experimental results reveal that introducing the second metal Fe creates a dual adsorption site that alters the O2 adsorption configuration and effectively activates the O&#9472;O bond, while the synergistic effect of dual Fe sites results in the downward shift of the d&#8208;band center, facilitating the release of OH*. Additionally, local electronic engineering of heteroatom S for Fe sites further facilitates the formation of the rate&#8208;determining step OOH*, thus accelerating the reaction kinetics.

         <title>Bioresorbable Multilayer Organic&#8211;Inorganic Films for Bioelectronic Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces an organic&#8211;inorganic multilayer design strategy for bioresorbable encapsulating structures that serve as water barriers for electronic systems. This approach not only protects implantable electronic devices from biofluids to ensure reliable operational performance but also enables favorable degradation after a desired period of use. This materials system&#160;may find broad and immediate applications for a range of practical electronic devices that are capable of resorption in biological and environmental settings.








Abstract
Bioresorbable electronic devices as temporary biomedical implants represent an emerging class of technology relevant to a range of patient conditions currently addressed with technologies that require surgical explantation after a desired period of use. Obtaining reliable performance and favorable degradation behavior demands materials that can serve as biofluid barriers in encapsulating structures that avoid premature degradation of active electronic components. Here, this work presents a materials design that addresses this need, with properties in water impermeability, mechanical flexibility, and processability that are superior to alternatives. The approach uses multilayer assemblies of alternating films of polyanhydride and silicon oxynitride formed by spin&#8208;coating and plasma&#8208;enhanced chemical vapor deposition , respectively. Experimental and theoretical studies investigate the effects of material composition and multilayer structure on water barrier performance, water distribution, and degradation behavior. Demonstrations with inductor&#8208;capacitor circuits, wireless power transfer systems, and wireless optoelectronic devices illustrate the performance of this materials system as a bioresorbable encapsulating structure.

         <title>150 Gbps THz Chipscale Topological Photonic Diplexer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The on&#8208;chip photonic diplexer for sixth to X generation communication works on the principle of power splitting and terahertz spectrum filtering. The topological nature of the silicon chip facilitates simultaneous multiplexing and demultiplexing of the two broadband 12.5 GHz channels (CH1 and CH2) to support an aggregated data speed of 150 Gbps.








Abstract
Photonic diplexers are being widely investigated for high data transfer rates in on&#8208;chip communication. However, dividing the available spectrum into nonoverlapping multicarrier frequency sub&#8208;bands has remained a challenge in designing frequency&#8208;selective time&#8208;invariant channels. Here, an on&#8208;chip topological diplexer is reported exhibiting terahertz frequency band filtering through Klein tunneling of topological edge modes. The silicon topological diplexer chip facilitates two high&#8208;speed channels with quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) over a broad bandwidth of 12.5 GHz each. These channels operate at carrier frequencies of 305 and 321.6 GHz, achieving a combined diplexer capacity of 150 Gbit&#160;s&#8722;1. To ensure minimal interference between adjacent channels, a guard band is implemented. Topologically protected edge modes suppress the frequency selective fading of the broadband signals and hold promise for diverse integrated photonic applications spanning terahertz and telecommunication realms, including the design of lossless topological multiplexers, interconnects, antennas, and modulators for the sixth to X generation (6G to XG) wireless.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Assisted Generation and Straight Movement of Skyrmion Bubble in Kagome TbMn6Sn6</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The precise generation and straight movement of skyrmion bubble are demonstrated at zero field and room temperature in the Kagome plane of TbMn6Sn6 by conveniently electron&#8208;assisted heating, where the crucial contribution of local anisotropy variation near the spin reorientation transition and geometric confinement is validated in simulation, highlighting a significant possibility for the compatible application in skyrmionic devices.








Abstract
Topological magnetic textures are promising candidates as binary data units for the next&#8208;generation memory device. The precise generation and convenient control of nontrivial spin topology at zero field near room temperature endows the critical advantages in skyrmionic devices but is not simultaneously integrated into one material. Here, in the Kagome plane of quantum TbMn6Sn6, the expedient generation of the skyrmion bubbles in versatile forms of lattice, chain, and isolated one by converging the electron beam, where the electron intensity gradient contributes to the dynamic generation from local anisotropy variation near spin reorientation transition (SRT) is reported. Encouragingly, by utilizing the dynamic shift of the SRT domain interface, the straight movement is actualized with the skyrmion bubble slave to the SRT domain interface forming an elastic composite object, avoiding the usual deflection from the skyrmion Hall effect. The critical contribution of the SRT domain interface via conveniently electron&#8208;assisted heating is further theoretically validated in micromagnetic simulation, highlighting the compatible application possibility in advanced devices.

         <title>Resonant Band Hybridization in Alloyed Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Heterobilayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bandstructure engineering using alloying is widely utilized for achieving optimized performance in modern semiconductor devices. Here, this approach is applied to van der Waals heterostructures built from semiconducting monolayers of MoxW1 &#8722; xSe2 alloy and WSe2 (or MoSe2). Interlayer exciton photoluminescence monitors the bandstructure modifications as a function of alloy composition x. Strong bandstructure hybridization is unveiled leading to a transition from direct to indirect bandgap for x&lt;0.6 in MoxW1 &#8722; xSe2/WSe2 heterostructures.








Abstract
Bandstructure engineering using alloying is widely utilized for achieving optimized performance in modern semiconductor devices. While alloying has been studied in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides, its application in van der Waals heterostructures built from atomically thin layers is largely unexplored. Here, heterobilayers made from monolayers of WSe2 (or MoSe2) and MoxW1 &#8722; xSe2 alloy are fabricated and nontrivial tuning of the resultant bandstructure is observed as a function of concentration x. This evolution is monitored by measuring the energy of photoluminescence (PL) of the interlayer exciton (IX) composed of an electron and hole residing in different monolayers. In MoxW1 &#8722; xSe2/WSe2, a strong IX energy shift of &#8776;100 meV is observed for x varied from 1 to 0.6. However, for x &lt; 0.6 this shift saturates and the IX PL energy asymptotically approaches that of the indirect bandgap in bilayer WSe2. This observation is theoretically interpreted as the strong variation of the conduction band K valley for x &gt; 0.6, with IX PL arising from the K &#8722; K transition, while for x &lt; 0.6, the bandstructure hybridization becomes prevalent leading to the dominating momentum&#8208;indirect K &#8722; Q transition. This bandstructure hybridization is accompanied with strong modification of IX PL dynamics and nonlinear exciton properties. This work provides foundation for bandstructure engineering in van der Waals heterostructures highlighting the importance of hybridization effects and opening a way to devices with accurately tailored electronic&#160;properties.

         <title>Controlled Refolding of Denatured IL&#8208;12 Using In Situ Antigen&#8208;Capturing Nanochaperone Remarkably Reduces the Systemic Toxicity and Enhances Cancer Immunotherapy</title>

A self&#8208;assembled nanochaperone (P&#8208;nChap) is designed as in situ antigen capturing nanovaccine to enhance cytokine&#8208;based cancer immunotherapy. P&#8208;nChap effectively avoids on&#8208;target, off&#8208;tumor toxicity of IL&#8208;12 by delivering its denatured form, which can be only refolded into native states in response to tumor microenvironment. Moreover, P&#8208;nChap releases PTX to produce ICD, captures TAAs and transports to DCs to facilitate antigen cross&#8208;presentation.








Abstract
Cytokines are powerful in cancer immunotherapy, however, their therapeutic potential is limited by the severe systemic toxicity. Here a potent strategy to reduce the toxicity of systemic cytokine therapy by delivering its denatured form using a finely designed nanochaperone, is described. It is demonstrated that even if the denatured protein cargos are occasionally released under normal physiological conditions they are still misfolded, while can effectively refold into native states and release to function in tumor microenvironment. Consequently, the systemic toxicity of cytokines is nearly completely overcome. Moreover, an immunogenic cell death (ICD)&#8208;inducing chemotherapeutic is further loaded and delivered to tumor using this nanochaperone to trigger the release of tumor&#8208;associated antigens (TAAs) that are subsequently captured in situ by nanochaperone and then reflows into lymph nodes (LNs) to promote antigen cross&#8208;presentation. This optimized personalized nanochaperone&#8208;vaccine demonstrates unprecedented suppressive effects against large, advanced tumors, and in combination with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy results in a significant abscopal effect and inhibition of postoperative tumor recurrence and metastasis. Hence, this approach provides a simple and universal delivery strategy to reduce the systemic toxicities of cytokines, as well as provides a robust personalized cancer vaccination platform, which may find wide applications in cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Intrinsic Defect&#8208;Driven Synergistic Synaptic Heterostructures for Gate&#8208;Free Neuromorphic Phototransistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative gate&#8208;free Fe7S8@MoS2 heterostructure wherein a defect&#8208;rich Fe7S8 core is enveloped snugly by a curved MoS2 dome shell is developed to realize the effective photocarrier trapping through the exploitation of intrinsic defects in the Fe7S8 core. The resultant neuromorphic devices exhibit remarkable light&#8208;tunable synaptic behaviors, thus demonstrating great advances in simulating visual recognition system.








Abstract
The optoelectronic synaptic devices based on two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials offer great advances for future neuromorphic visual systems with dramatically improved integration density and power efficiency. The effective charge capture and retention are considered as one vital prerequisite to realizing the synaptic memory function. However, the current 2D synaptic devices are predominantly relied on materials with artificially&#8208;engineered defects or intricate gate&#8208;controlled architectures to realize the charge trapping process. These approaches, unfortunately, suffer from the degradation of pristine materials, rapid device failure, and unnecessary complication of device structures. To address these challenges, an innovative gate&#8208;free heterostructure paradigm is introduced herein. The heterostructure presents a distinctive dome&#8208;like morphology wherein a defect&#8208;rich Fe7S8 core is enveloped snugly by a curved MoS2 dome shell (Fe7S8@MoS2), allowing the realization of effective photocarrier trapping through the intrinsic defects in the adjacent Fe7S8 core. The resultant neuromorphic devices exhibit remarkable light&#8208;tunable synaptic behaviors with memory time up to &#8776;800 s under single optical pulse, thus demonstrating great advances in simulating visual recognition system with significantly improved image recognition efficiency. The emergence of such heterostructures foreshadows a promising trajectory for underpinning future synaptic devices, catalyzing the realization of high&#8208;efficiency and intricate visual processing applications.

         <title>A Gas Therapy Strategy for Intestinal Flora Regulation and Colitis Treatment by Nanogel&#8208;Based Multistage NO Delivery Microcapsules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanogel&#8208;based multistage NO delivery microcapsules are developed to regulate the intestinal microbiota for the colitis treatment by targeting inflamed tissues to release NO. This microcapsule exhibits good resistance to digestive fluids and the nanogel has good inflammation targeting and NO release properties. In vivo experiments show that the gas therapy strategy modulates intestinal microbiota, reducing inflammation and promoting intestinal repair.








Abstract
Current approaches to treating inflammatory bowel disease focus on the suppression of overactive immune responses, the removal of reactive intestinal oxygen species, and regulation of the intestinal flora. However, owing to the complex structure of the gastrointestinal tract and the influence of mucus, current small&#8208;molecule and biologic&#8208;based drugs for treating colitis cannot effectively act at the site of colon inflammation, and as a result, they tend to exhibit low efficacies and toxic side effects. In this study, nanogel&#8208;based multistage NO delivery microcapsules are developed to achieve NO release at the inflammation site by targeting the inflammatory tissues using the nanogel. Surprisingly, oral administration of the microcapsules suppresses the growth of pathogenic bacteria and increases the abundance of probiotic bacteria. Metabolomics further show that an increased abundance of intestinal probiotics promotes the production of metabolites, including short&#8208;chain fatty acids and indole derivatives, which modulate the intestinal immunity and restore the intestinal barrier via the interleukin&#8208;17 and PI3K&#8208;Akt signaling pathways. This work reveals that the developed gas therapy strategy based on multistage NO delivery microcapsules modulates the intestinal microbial balance, thereby reducing inflammation and promoting intestinal barrier repair, ultimately providing a new therapeutic approach for the clinical management of colitis.

         <title>In Situ Mitochondrial Biomineralization for Drug&#8208;Free Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ mitochondrial biomineralization approach is developed, where the mitochondrial targeted nanosystem is activated via near&#8208;infrared (NIR) irradiation as a burst source of PO43&#8722; and Ca2+ for drug&#8208;free cancer therapy.








Abstract
The common clinical chemotherapy often brings serious side effects to patients, mainly due to the off&#8208;target and leakage of toxic drugs. However, this is fatal for some specific clinical tumors, such as brain tumors and neuroma. This study performs a drug&#8208;free approach by encapsulating black phosphorus (BP) and calcium peroxide (CaO2) in liposomes with surface&#8208;modified triphenylphosphonium (BCLT) to develop mitochondria targeting calcification for cancer therapy without damaging normal cells. BCLT preferentially accumulates inside tumor mitochondria and then is activated by near&#8208;infrared (NIR) laser irradiation to produce abundant PO43&#8722; and Ca2+ to accelerate in situ mitochondrial mineralization, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and cancer cell death. More importantly, both PO43&#8722; and Ca2+ are essential components of metabolism in the body, and random gradient diffusion or premature leakage does not cause damage to adjacent normal cells. This achievement promises to be an alternative to conventional chemotherapy in clinical practice for many specific tumor types.

         <title>Inflammation&#8208;Responsive Cell Membrane&#8208;Camouflaged Nanoparticles against Liver Fibrosis via Regulating Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress and Oxidative Stress</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The PLGA@Melatonin is constructed by loading melatonin with poly (lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) (PLGA). Platelet membranes (PM) and activated hepatic stellate cell membranes (HSCM) with high expression of the platelet&#8208;derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) are extracted to successfully construct PM@PLGA@Melatonin and HSCM@PLGA@Melatonin, which are subsequently utilized to treat mice with liver fibrosis.








Abstract
Liver fibrosis represents a reversible stage of various chronic liver diseases that progresses to cirrhosis. This condition is characterized by an imbalance between tissue damage and repair, and the production of fibers in the liver exceeds their degradation. Oxidative stress (OS) resulting from tissue injury and endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) triggered by the overproduction of proteins are pivotal factors in liver fibrosis. Melatonin demonstrates the capability to neutralize free radicals, shielding cells from oxidative harm. It is also a specific inhibitor of the ERS receptor transcription activating factor 6 (ATF6), indicating its great potential in ameliorating liver fibrosis. However, its limited water solubility and oral bioavailability of under 15% present hurdles in achieving therapeutic blood concentrations for treating liver fibrosis. The PLGA@Melatonin is constructed by loading melatonin with poly (lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) (PLGA). Platelet membranes (PM) and activated hepatic stellate cell membranes (HSCM) with high expression of the platelet&#8208;derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) are extracted to successfully construct PM@PLGA@Melatonin and HSCM@PLGA@Melatonin, which are subsequently utilized to treat mice with liver fibrosis.

&lt;p&gt;The PLGA@Melatonin is constructed by loading melatonin with poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA). Platelet membranes (PM) and activated hepatic stellate cell membranes (HSCM) with high expression of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) are extracted to successfully construct PM@PLGA@Melatonin and HSCM@PLGA@Melatonin, which are subsequently utilized to treat mice with liver fibrosis.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liver fibrosis represents a reversible stage of various chronic liver diseases that progresses to cirrhosis. This condition is characterized by an imbalance between tissue damage and repair, and the production of fibers in the liver exceeds their degradation. Oxidative stress (OS) resulting from tissue injury and endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) triggered by the overproduction of proteins are pivotal factors in liver fibrosis. Melatonin demonstrates the capability to neutralize free radicals, shielding cells from oxidative harm. It is also a specific inhibitor of the ERS receptor transcription activating factor 6 (ATF6), indicating its great potential in ameliorating liver fibrosis. However, its limited water solubility and oral bioavailability of under 15% present hurdles in achieving therapeutic blood concentrations for treating liver fibrosis. The PLGA@Melatonin is constructed by loading melatonin with poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA). Platelet membranes (PM) and activated hepatic stellate cell membranes (HSCM) with high expression of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) are extracted to successfully construct PM@PLGA@Melatonin and HSCM@PLGA@Melatonin, which are subsequently utilized to treat mice with liver fibrosis.

         <title>Gold Recovery from E&#8208;Waste by Food&#8208;Waste Amyloid Aerogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents an innovative approach to recover gold from e&#8208;waste using protein amyloid aerogels derived from food waste. These aerogels demonstrate exceptional gold adsorption capabilities, transforming gold ions into gold single crystals at the microscopic level and yielding a high&#8208;purity 22&#8208;carat gold nugget in bulk, demonstrating an eco&#8208;friendly and cost&#8208;effective potential for gold recovery.








Abstract
Demand for gold recovery from e&#8208;waste grows steadily due to its pervasive use in the most diverse technical applications. Current methods of gold recovery are resource&#8208;intensive, necessitating the development of more efficient extraction materials. This study explores protein amyloid nanofibrils (AF) derived from whey, a dairy industry side&#8208;stream, as a novel adsorbent for gold recovery from e&#8208;waste. To do so, AF aerogels are prepared and assessed against gold adsorption capacity and selectivity over other metals present in waste electrical and electronic equipment (e&#8208;waste). The results demonstrate that AF aerogel has a remarkable gold adsorption capacity (166.7&#160;mg g&#8722;1) and selectivity, making it efficient and an adsorbent for gold recovery. Moreover, AF aerogels are efficient templates to convert gold ions into single crystalline flakes due to Au growth along the (111) plane. When used as templates to recover gold from e&#8208;waste solutions obtained by dissolving computer motherboards in suitable solvents, the process yields high&#8208;purity gold nuggets, constituted by &#8776;90.8&#160;wt% gold (21&#8211;22 carats), with trace amounts of other metals. Life cycle assessment and techno&#8211;economic analysis of the process finally consolidate the potential of protein nanofibril aerogels from food side&#8208;streams as an environmentally friendly and economically viable approach for gold recovery from e&#8208;waste.

         <title>22% Record Efficiency in Nanorod Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Achieved by Gradient Shells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;efficiency nanorod light&#8208;emitting&#8208;diodes (NR&#8208;LEDs) are fabricated using CdSe/CdZnSe/CdZnS/ZnS core/shell nanorods. The gradient alloyed CdZnSe/CdZnS shell effectively suppresses the electron delocalization and reduces hole injection barrier compared with conventional CdS shell. Therefore, the NRs exhibit near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield and a high degree of linear polarization. The NR&#8208;LEDs show record external quantum efficiency, high brightness, and high current efficiency simultaneously.








Abstract
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) in light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) based on isotropic quantum dots has approached the theoretical limit of close to 20%. Anisotropic nanorods can break this limit by taking advantage of their directional emission. However, the progress towards higher EQE by using CdSe/CdS nanorods (NRs) faces several challenges, primarily involving the low quantum yield and unbalanced charge injection in devices. Herein, the seeded growth method is modified and anisotropic nanorods are obtained with photoluminescence quantum yield up to 98% by coating a gradient alloyed CdZnSe shell around conventional spherical CdSe seeds. This intermediate alloyed CdZnSe shell combined with a subsequent rod&#8208;shaped CdZnS/ZnS shell can effectively suppress the electron delocalization in the typical CdSe/CdS nanorods due to their small conduction bandgap offset. Additionally, this alloyed shell can reduce the hole&#8208;injection barrier and create a larger barrier for electron injection, both effects promoting a balanced injection of electrons and holes in LEDs. Hence, LEDs are reached with high brightness (160341&#160;cd m&#8722;2) and high efficiency (EQE = 22%, current efficiency = 23.19&#160;cd A&#8722;1), which are the highest values to date for nanorod LEDs.

         <title>Drug&#8208;Loaded Bacillus Calmette&#8211;Gu&#233;rin Bacteria for Immuno&#8208;Chemo Combo Therapy in Bladder Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
During intravesical treatment, Bacillus Calmette&#8211;Gu&#233;rin (BCG) facilitates the tumor&#8208;targeted delivery of doxorubicin (DOX) nanoparticles. Subsequently, the released DOX induces both chemotherapeutic and immunogenic tumor cell death, thereby releasing additional damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns. This synergistic interaction between DOX and BCG contributes to the establishment of antitumor immunity, ultimately achieving a comprehensive intravesical therapy of bladder cancer.








Abstract
Intravesical Bacillus Calmette&#8211;Gu&#233;rin (BCG) is a well&#8208;established strategy for managing high&#8208;risk nonmuscle&#8208;invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC); however, over half of patients still experience disease recurrence or progression. Although the combined intravesical instillation of various chemotherapeutic drugs is implemented in clinical trials to enhance the BCG therapy, the outcome is far from satisfying due to severe irritative effects and treatment intolerance at high doses. Therefore, it is adopted the &#8220;biotin&#8211;streptavidin strategy&#8221; to doxorubicin (DOX)&#8208;encapsulated nanoparticles within live BCG bacteria (DOX@BCG) to improve treatment outcomes. Adherence of BCG to the bladder epithelium helps precisely target DOX@BCG to the local tumor cells and simultaneously increases intratumoral transport of therapeutic drugs. DOX@BCG effectively inhibits cancer progression and prolongs the survival of rats/mice with orthotopic bladder cancer owing to synergism between BCG&#8208;immunotherapy, DOX&#8208;chemotherapy, and DOX&#8208;induced immunogenic tumor cell death; furthermore, it exhibits improved tolerance and biosafety, and establishes antitumor immunity in the tumor microenvironment. Therefore, the drug&#8208;loaded live BCG bacterial delivery system holds considerable potential for clinical translation in the intravesical treatment of bladder cancer.

         <title>Sensitive Organic Photodetectors With Spectral Response up to 1.3&#160;&#181;m Using a Quinoidal Molecular Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A quinoidal molecular semiconductor, with a photoelectric response of up to 1.3&#160;&#181;m, is developed. The resulting photodetector affords unprecedented external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 26% and 41% at a wavelength of 1.10&#160;&#181;m under zero bias and a reverse bias, respectively. Moreover, owing to the low trap density, the photodetector demonstrates detectivity exceeding 1012 Jones from 0.3&#8211;1.3&#160;&#181;m.








Abstract
Detecting short&#8208;wavelength infrared (SWIR) light has underpinned several emerging technologies. However, the development of highly sensitive organic photodetectors (OPDs) operating in the SWIR region is hindered by their poor external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) and high dark currents. Herein, the development of high&#8208;sensitivity SWIR&#8208;OPDs with an efficient photoelectric response extending up to 1.3&#160;&#181;m is reported. These OPDs utilize a new ultralow&#8208;bandgap molecular semiconductor featuring a quinoidal tricyclic electron&#8208;deficient central unit and multiple non&#8208;covalent conformation locks. The SWIR&#8208;OPD achieves an unprecedented EQE of 26% under zero bias and an even more impressive EQE of up to 41% under a &#8211;4&#160;V bias at 1.10&#160;&#181;m, effectively pushing the detection limit of silicon photodetectors. Additionally, the low energetic disorder and trap density in the active layer lead to significant suppression of thermal&#8208;generation carriers and dark current, resulting in excellent detectivity (Dsh*) exceeding 1013 Jones from 0.50 to 1.21&#160;&#181;m and surpassing 1012 Jones even at 1.30&#160;&#181;m under zero bias, marking the highest achievements for OPDs beyond the silicon limit to date. Validation with photoplethysmography measurements, a spectrometer prototype in the 0.35&#8211;1.25&#160;&#181;m range, and image capture under 1.20&#160;&#181;m irradiation demonstrate the extensive applications of this SWIR&#8208;OPD.

The SWIR-OPD achieves an unprecedented EQE of 26% under zero bias and an even more impressive EQE of up to 41% under a &#8211;4&#160;V bias at 1.10&#160;&#181;m, effectively pushing the detection limit of silicon photodetectors. Additionally, the low energetic disorder and trap density in the active layer lead to significant suppression of thermal-generation carriers and dark current, resulting in excellent detectivity (&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;sh&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;) exceeding 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; Jones from 0.50 to 1.21&#160;&#181;m and surpassing 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; Jones even at 1.30&#160;&#181;m under zero bias, marking the highest achievements for OPDs beyond the silicon limit to date. Validation with photoplethysmography measurements, a spectrometer prototype in the 0.35&#8211;1.25&#160;&#181;m range, and image capture under 1.20&#160;&#181;m irradiation demonstrate the extensive applications of this SWIR-OPD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineered Microchannel Scaffolds with Instructive Niches Reinforce Endogenous Bone Regeneration by Regulating CSF&#8208;1/CSF&#8208;1R Pathway</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, a hybrid microchannel scaffold with instructive niches is engineered by a circumferential freeze&#8208;casting technique with an alkaline salting&#8208;out strategy. This scaffold orchestrates the advantage of an oriented porous structure for rapid cell infiltration and satisfactory immunomodulatory capacity to promote stem cell recruitment, retention, and subsequent osteogenic differentiation by regulating the colony&#8208;stimulating factor&#8208;1 (CSF&#8208;1)/colony&#8208;stimulating factor&#8208;1 receptor (CSF&#8208;1R) pathway of macrophages.








Abstract
Structural and physiological cues provide guidance for the directional migration and spatial organization of endogenous cells. Here, a microchannel scaffold with instructive niches is developed using a circumferential freeze&#8208;casting technique with an alkaline salting&#8208;out strategy. Thereinto, polydopamine&#8208;coated nano&#8208;hydroxyapatite is employed as a functional inorganic linker to participate in the entanglement and crystallization of chitosan molecules. This scaffold orchestrates the advantage of an oriented porous structure for rapid cell infiltration and satisfactory immunomodulatory capacity to promote stem cell recruitment, retention, and subsequent osteogenic differentiation. Transcriptomic analysis as well as its in vitro and in vivo verification demonstrates that essential colony&#8208;stimulating factor&#8208;1 (CSF&#8208;1) factor is induced by this scaffold, and effectively bound to the target colony&#8208;stimulating factor&#8208;1 receptor (CSF&#8208;1R) on the macrophage surface to activate the M2 phenotype, achieving substantial endogenous bone regeneration. This strategy provides a simple and efficient approach for engineering inducible bone regenerative biomaterials.

         <title>Engineering Dual CO2&#8208; and Photothermal&#8208;Responsive Membranes for Switchable Double Emulsion Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;coated fiber consisting of primary photothermal&#8208;responsive and secondary CO2&#8208;responsive coatings is prepared by two&#8208;step coating. Automated weaving of these fibers produces membranes with photothermal&#8208; and CO2&#8208;responsive characteristics, achieving on&#8208;demand separation of various double oil&#8208;in&#8208;water&#8208;in&#8208;oil and water&#8208;in&#8208;oil&#8208;in&#8208;water emulsions with separation efficiencies exceeding 99.6%. 








Abstract
Stimulus&#8208;responsive membranes demonstrate promising applications in switchable oil/water emulsion separations. However, they are unsuitable for the treatment of double emulsions like oil&#8208;in&#8208;water&#8208;in&#8208;oil (O/W/O) and water&#8208;in&#8208;oil&#8208;in&#8208;water (W/O/W) emulsions. For efficient separation of these complicated emulsions, fine control over the wettability, response time, and aperture structure of the membrane is required. Herein, dual&#8208;coated fibers consisting of primary photothermal&#8208;responsive and secondary CO2&#8208;responsive coatings are prepared by two steps. Automated weaving of these fibers produces membranes with photothermal&#8208; and CO2&#8208;responsive characteristics and narrow pore size distributions. These membranes exhibit fast switching wettability between superhydrophilicity (under CO2 stimulation) and high hydrophobicity (under near&#8208;infrared stimulation), achieving on&#8208;demand separation of various O/W/O and W/O/W emulsions with separation efficiencies exceeding 99.6%. Two&#8208;dimensional low&#8208;field nuclear magnetic resonance and correlated spectra technique are used to clarify the underlying mechanism of switchable double emulsion separation. The approach can effectively address the challenges associated with the use of stimulus&#8208;responsive membranes for double emulsion separation and facilitate the industrial application of these membranes.

         <title>Triboelectric Energy Harvesting from Highly Conjugated Fused Aromatic Ladder Structure Under Extreme Environmental Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D&#8208;fused aromatic ladder (FAL) structure is developed as a tribo&#8208;positive material for triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG). The 3D&#8208;FAL offers high specific surface area and porosity, good physicochemical stability, and tunable electronic properties. As a result, the 3D&#8208;FAL&#8208;based TENG demonstrates high performance and stability under harsh operating conditions.








Abstract
Practical application of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) has been challenging, particularly, under harsh environmental conditions. This work proposes a novel 3D&#8208;fused aromatic ladder (FAL) structure as a tribo&#8208;positive material for TENGs, to address these challenges. The 3D&#8208;FAL offers a unique materials engineering platform for tailored properties, such as high specific surface area and porosity, good thermal and mechanical stability, and tunable electronic properties. The fabricated 3D&#8208;FAL&#8208;based TENG reaches a maximum peak power density of 451.2 &#181;W cm&#8722;2 at 5 Hz frequency. More importantly, the 3D&#8208;FAL&#8208;based TENG maintains stable output performance under harsh operating environments, over wide temperature (&#8722;45&#8211;100&#160;&#176;C) and humidity ranges (8.3&#8211;96.7% RH), representing the development of novel FAL for sustainable energy generation under challenging environmental conditions. Furthermore, the 3D&#8208;FAL&#8208;based TENG proves to be a promising device for a speed monitoring system engaging reconstruction in virtual reality in a snowy environment.

         <title>Molecular Engineering Enables Hydrogel Electrolyte with Ionic Hopping Migration and Self&#8208;Healability toward Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular engineering strategy is presented to introduce oxygen&#8208;rich poly(urea&#8208;urethane) (OR&#8208;PUU) into polyacrylamide (PAM)&#8208;based (OR&#8208;PUU/PAM) hydrogel electrolytes. Benefiting from their high ionic conductivity, desolvation effect, ionic hopping migration, and self&#8208;healability, the resulting Zn symmetric cell exhibits prominent cycling stability. This work provides meaningful guidance for the development of high&#8208;performance zinc&#8208;based hydrogel electrolytes.








Abstract
Hydrogel electrolytes (HEs), characterized by intrinsic safety, mechanical stability, and biocompatibility, can promote the development of flexible aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (FAZIBs). However, current FAZIB technology is severely restricted by the uncontrollable dendrite growth arising from undesirable reactions between the HEs with sluggish ionic conductivity and Zn metal. To overcome this challenge, this work proposes a molecular engineering strategy, which involves the introduction of oxygen&#8208;rich poly(urea&#8208;urethane) (OR&#8208;PUU) into polyacrylamide (PAM)&#8208;based HEs. The OR&#8208;PUU/PAM HEs facilitate rapid ion transfer through their ionic hopping migration mechanism, resulting in uniform and orderly Zn2+ deposition. The abundant polar groups on the OR&#8208;PUU molecules in OR&#8208;PUU/PAM HEs break the inherent H&#8208;bond network, tune the solvation structure of hydrated Zn2+, and inhibit the occurrence of side reactions. Moreover, the interaction of hierarchical H&#8208;bonds in the OR&#8208;PUU/PAM HEs endows them with self&#8208;healability, enabling in situ repair of cracks induced by plating/stripping. Consequently, Zn symmetric cells incorporating the novel OR&#8208;PUU/PAM HEs exhibit a long cycling life of 2000&#160;h. The resulting Zn&#8211;MnO2 battery displays a low capacity decay rate of 0.009% over 2000 cycles at 2000&#160;mA g&#8722;1. Overall, this work provides valuable insights to facilitate the realization of dendrite&#8208;free Zn&#8208;metal anodes through the molecular engineering of HEs.

The resulting Zn&#8211;MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; battery displays a low capacity decay rate of 0.009% over 2000 cycles at 2000&#160;mA g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Overall, this work provides valuable insights to facilitate the realization of dendrite-free Zn-metal anodes through the molecular engineering of HEs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In Situ&#8208;Sprayed Bioinspired Adhesive Conductive Hydrogels for Cavernous Nerve Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a bioinspired nucleobase adhesion strategy is proposed to design an adhesive conductive hydrogel spray with immunomodulatory, and endoscopic delivery convenience for cavernous nerve repair. The feasibility and validity of sprayable hydrogel in minimally invasive surgery is verified through the use of a beagle model. The results reveal the great potential of sprayable conductive hydrogel materials as next&#8208;generation minimally invasive nerve repair materials.








Abstract
Cavernous nerve injury (CNI), resulting in erectile dysfunction (ED), poses a significant threat to the quality of life for men. Strategies utilizing conductive hydrogels have demonstrated promising results for the treatment of peripheral nerves with a large diameter (&gt;2&#160;mm). However, integrating convenient minimally invasive operation, antiswelling and immunomodulatory conductive hydrogels for treating small&#8208;diameter injured cavernous nerves remains a great challenge. Here, a sprayable adhesive conductive hydrogel (GACM) composed of gelatin, adenine, carbon nanotubes, and mesaconate designed for cavernous nerve repair is developed. Multiple hydrogen bonds provide GACM with excellent adhesive and antiswelling properties, enabling it to establish a conformal electrical bridge with the damaged nerve and aiding in the regeneration process. Additionally, mesaconate&#8208;loaded GACM suppresses the release of inflammatory factors by macrophages and promotes the migration and proliferation of Schwann cells. In vivo tests demonstrate that the GACM hydrogel repairs the cavernous nerve and restores erectile function and fertility. Furthermore, the feasibility of sprayable GACM in minimally invasive robotic surgery in beagles is validated. Given the benefits of therapeutic effectiveness and clinical convenience, the research suggests a promising future for sprayable GACM materials as advanced solutions for minimally invasive nerve repair.

         <title>Important Role of Ion Flux Regulated by Separators in Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The three&#8208;dimensional pore structures of polyolefin separators have a significant influence on the ion flux distribution towards the lithium (Li) electrode, which consequently causes different Li deposition behavior. It is revealed that an appropriate separator creates a more homogeneous Li ion flux, a more compact deposit Li, and enables Li metal batteries to achieve a longer cycle life.








Abstract
Polyolefin separators are the most common separators used in rechargeable lithium (Li)&#8208;ion batteries. However, the influence of different polyolefin separators on the performance of Li metal batteries (LMBs) has not been well studied. By performing particle injection simulations on the reconstructed three&#8208;dimensional&#160;pores of different polyethylene separators, it is revealed that the pore structure of the separator has a significant impact on the ion flux distribution, the Li deposition behavior, and consequently, the cycle life of LMBs. It is also discovered that the homogeneity factor of Li&#8208;ion toward Li metal electrode is positively correlated to the longevity and reproducibility of LMBs. This work not only emphasizes the importance of the pore structure of polyolefin separators but also provides an economic and effective method to screen favorable separators for LMBs.

         <title>Coexistence of Quantum&#8208;Spin&#8208;Hall and Quantum&#8208;Hall&#8208;Topological&#8208;Insulating States in Graphene/hBN on SrTiO3 Substrate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of a monolayer hBN spacer allows the coexistence of quantum Hall topological insulating (QHTI) and quantum spin Hall (QSH) states with different symmetries and causes for the helical edge spin phases in the same single graphene placed on an SrTiO3 substrate, with a crossover regime between the two at low magnetic fields.








Abstract
SrTiO3 (STO) substrate, a perovskite oxide material known for its high dielectric constant (&#603;), facilitates the observation of various (high&#8208;temperature) quantum phenomena. A quantum Hall topological insulating (QHTI) state, comprising two copies of QH states with antiparallel two ferromagnetic edge&#8208;spin overlap protected by the U(1) axial rotation symmetry of spin polarization, has recently been achieved in low magnetic field (B) even as high as &#8776;100 K in a monolayer graphene/thin hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) spacer placed on an STO substrate, thanks to the high &#603; of STO. Despite the use of the heavy STO substrate, however, proximity&#8208;induced quantum spin Hall (QSH) states in 2D TI phases, featuring a topologically protected helical edge spin phase within time&#8208;reversal&#8208;symmetry, is not confirmed. Here, with the use of a monolayer hBN spacer, it is revealed the coexistence of QSH (at B = 0T) and QHTI (at B &#8800; 0) states in the same single graphene sample placed on an STO, with a crossover regime between the two at low B. It is also classified that the different symmetries of the two nontrivial helical edge spin phases in the two states lead to different interaction with electron&#8208;puddle quantum dots, caused by a local surface pocket of the STO, in the crossover regime, resulting in a spin dephasing only for the QHTI state. The results obtained using STO substrates open the doors to investigations of novel QH spin states with different symmetries and their correlations with quantum phenomena. This exploration holds value for potential applications in spintronic devices.

         <title>Underpotential Deposition of 3D Transition Metals: Versatile Electrosynthesis of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts on Oxidized Carbon Supports</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops a simple, versatile approach for synthesis of oxidized carbon&#8208;supported mono&#8208; and bi&#8208;metallic single atom catalysts (SACs) based on underpotential deposition. The authors achieve minute&#8208;scale synthesis of Cu, Fe, Co, and Ni SACs under ambient conditions and showcase the catalytic performance of an as&#8208;synthesized Co SAC for electrochemical nitrate reduction to ammonia.








Abstract
Use of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) has become a popular strategy for tuning activity and selectivity toward specific pathways. However, conventional SAC synthesis methods require high temperatures and pressures, complicated procedures, and expensive equipment. Recently, underpotential deposition (UPD) has been investigated as a promising alternative, yielding high&#8208;loading SAC electrodes under ambient conditions and within minutes. Yet only few studies have employed UPD to synthesize SACs, and all have been limited to UPD of Cu. In this work, a flexible UPD approach for synthesis of mono&#8208; and bi&#8208;metallic Cu, Fe, Co, and Ni SACs directly on oxidized, commercially available carbon electrodes is reported. The UPD mechanism is investigated using in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and, finally, the catalytic performance of a UPD&#8208;synthesized Co SAC is assessed for electrochemical nitrate reduction to ammonia. The findings expand upon the usefulness and versatility of UPD for SAC synthesis, with hopes of enabling future research toward realization of fast, reliable, and fully electrified SAC synthesis processes.

This study shows that self&#8208;assembled zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8211;MXene nanocomposites, featuring tunable built&#8208;in electric field, exhibit outstanding microwave absorption performance (reflection loss (RLmin) = &#8722;47.35 dB and effective absorption bandwidth (fE) = 6.32 GHz). This innovative model system provides insights into interfacial polarization mechanisms and introduces a pioneering approach to developing electromagnetic functional materials through spatial charge heterointerface engineering.








Abstract
Heterointerface engineering, which plays a pivotal role in developing advanced microwave&#8208;absorbing materials, is employed to design zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF)&#8211;MXene nanocomposites. The ZIF&#8211;MXene composites are prepared by electrostatic self&#8208;assembly of negatively charged titanium carbide MXene flakes and positively charged Co&#8208;containing ZIF nanomaterials. This approach effectively creates abundant Mott&#8211;Schottky heterointerfaces exhibiting a robust built&#8208;in electric field (BIEF) effect, as evidenced by experimental and theoretical analyses, leading to a notable attenuation of electromagnetic energy. Systematic manipulation of the BIEF&#8208;exhibiting heterointerface, achieved through topological modulation of the ZIF, proficiently alters charge separation, facilitates electron migration, and ultimately enhances polarization relaxation loss, resulting in exceptional electromagnetic wave absorption performance (reflection loss RLmin = &#8722;47.35 dB and effective absorption bandwidth fE = 6.32 GHz). The present study demonstrates an innovative model system for elucidating the interfacial polarization mechanisms and pioneers a novel approach to developing functional materials with electromagnetic characteristics through spatial charge engineering.

         <title>Observation of High&#8208;Capacity Monoclinic B&#8208;Nb2O5 with Ultrafast Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monoclinic B&#8208;Nb2O5 of same chemistry as T&#8208;Nb2O5 and similar structure to B&#8208;TiO2 is essentially inert for lithium storage. To address this issue, here implementation of both electron transport and Li+ migration &#8220;superhighways&#8221; by developing defect&#8208;rich and nanoporous B&#8208;Nb2O5&#8722;x pseudocrystals via a &#8220;shape&#8208;keep&#8221; topological microcorrosion is proposed. The resulting B&#8208;Nb2O5&#8722;x achieves ultrahigh specific capacity and rate capability, surpassing that of Li4Ti5O12.








Abstract
Apart from Li4Ti5O12, there are few anode substitutes that can be used in commercial high&#8208;power lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Orthorhombic T&#8208;Nb2O5 has recently been proven to be another substitute anode. However, monoclinic B&#8208;Nb2O5 of same chemistry is essentially inert for lithium storage, but the underlying reasons are unclear. In order to activate the &#8220;inert&#8221; B&#8208;Nb2O5, herein, nanoporous pseudocrystals to achieve a larger specific capacity of 243 mAh g&#8722;1 than Li4Ti5O12 (theoretical capacity: 175 mAh g&#8722;1) are proposed. These pseudocrystals are rationally synthesized via a &#8220;shape&#8208;keep&#8221; topological microcorrosion process from LiNbO3 precursor. Compared to pristine B&#8208;Nb2O5, experimental investigations reveal that B&#8208;Nb2O5&#8722;x delivers &#8776;3000 times higher electronic conductivity and tenfold enhanced Li+ diffusion coefficient. An &#8776;30% reduction of energy barrier for Li&#8208;ion migration is also confirmed by the theoretical calculations. The nanoporous B&#8208;Nb2O5&#8722;x delivers unique ion/electron transport channels to proliferate the reversible and deeper lithiation, which activate the &#8220;inert&#8221; B&#8208;Nb2O5. The capacitive&#8208;like behavior is observed to endow B&#8208;Nb2O5&#8722;x ultrafast lithium storage ability, harvesting 136 mAh g&#8722;1 at 100 C and 72 mAh g&#8722;1 even at 250 C, superior to Li4Ti5O12. Pouch&#8208;type full cells exhibit the energy density of &#8776;251&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and ultrahigh power density up to &#8776;35&#160;kW kg&#8722;1.

         <title>PbS Quantum Dots Ink with Months&#8208;Long Shelf&#8208;Lifetime Enabling Scalable and Efficient Short&#8208;Wavelength Infrared Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methylammonium lead iodide is used in phase&#8208;transfer ligand exchange of&#160;PbS quantum dots of size up to 6.7 nm. These inks show at least ten&#8208;week shelf&#8208;life time, confirmed by the absorption spectroscopy and the field&#8208;effect transistor performances. Photodetectors fabricate via blade&#8208;coating exhibit 76% external quantum efficiency at 1300&#160;nm and 1.8&#160;&#215;&#160;1012&#160;Jones specific detectivity.








Abstract
The phase&#8208;transfer ligand exchange of PbS quantum dots (QDs) has substantially simplified device fabrication giving hope for future industrial exploitation. However, this technique when applied to QDs of large size (&gt;4&#160;nm) gives rise to inks with poor colloidal stability, thus hindering the development of QDs photodetectors in short&#8208;wavelength infrared range. Here, it is demonstrated that methylammonium lead iodide ligands can provide sufficient passivation of PbS QDs of size up to 6.7&#160;nm, enabling inks with a minimum of ten&#8208;week shelf&#8208;life time, as proven by optical absorption and solution&#8208;small angle X&#8208;ray scattering. Furthermore, the maximum linear electron mobility of 4.7&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 is measured in field&#8208;effect transistors fabricated with fresh inks, while transistors fabricated with the same solution after ten&#8208;week storage retain 74% of the average starting electron mobility, demonstrating the outstanding quality both of the fresh and aged inks. Finally, photodetectors fabricated via blade&#8208;coating exhibit 76% external quantum efficiency at 1300&#160;nm and 1.8&#160;&#215;&#160;1012&#160;Jones specific detectivity, values comparable with devices fabricated using ink with lower stability and wasteful methods such as spin&#8208;coating.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Rapid 3D Printing of Photoresponsive Resins for Optically Clear Multifunctional 3D Objects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The authors have developed novel visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven acrylic resins for photoactive 3D printing. Their mechanistic evaluation of photoinitiating systems enable 3D printing of transparent objects with rapid build speeds and exceptional feature resolution. By incorporating hexaarylbiimidazole derivatives in the resin formulation, spatially&#8208;resolved photoactivation is achieved, providing capabilities such as crack healing and selective erasing under violet/blue light irradiation.








Abstract
Light&#8208;driven 3D printing is gaining significant attention for its unparalleled build speed and high&#8208;resolution in additive manufacturing. However, extending vat photopolymerization to multifunctional, photoresponsive materials poses challenges, such as light attenuation and interference between the photocatalysts (PCs) and photoactive moieties. This study introduces novel visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven acrylic resins that enable rapid, high&#8208;resolution photoactive 3D printing. The synergistic combination of a cyanine&#8208;based PC, borate, and iodonium coinitiators (HNu 254) achieves an excellent printing rate and feature resolution under low&#8208;intensity, red light exposure. The incorporation of novel hexaarylbiimidazole (HABI) crosslinkers allows for spatially&#8208;resolved photoactivation upon exposure to violet/blue light. Furthermore, a photobleaching mechanism inhibited by HNu 254 during the photopolymerization process results in the production of optically&#8208;clear 3D printed objects. Real&#8208;time Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy validates the rapid photopolymerization of the HABI&#8208;containing acrylic resin, whereas mechanistic evaluations reveal the underlying dynamics that are responsible for the rapid photopolymerization rate, wavelength&#8208;orthogonal photoactivation, and observed photobleaching phenomenon. Ultimately, this visible&#8208;light&#8208;based printing method demonstrates: (i) rapid printing rate of 22.5&#160;mm h&#8722;1, (ii) excellent feature resolution (&#8776;20&#160;&#181;m), and (iii) production of optically clear object with self&#8208;healing capability and spatially controlled cleavage. This study serves as a roadmap for developing next&#8208;generation &#8220;smart&#8221; 3D printing technologies.

This study introduces novel visible-light-driven acrylic resins that enable rapid, high-resolution photoactive 3D printing. The synergistic combination of a cyanine-based PC, borate, and iodonium coinitiators (HNu 254) achieves an excellent printing rate and feature resolution under low-intensity, red light exposure. The incorporation of novel hexaarylbiimidazole (HABI) crosslinkers allows for spatially-resolved photoactivation upon exposure to violet/blue light. Furthermore, a photobleaching mechanism inhibited by HNu 254 during the photopolymerization process results in the production of optically-clear 3D printed objects. Real-time Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy validates the rapid photopolymerization of the HABI-containing acrylic resin, whereas mechanistic evaluations reveal the underlying dynamics that are responsible for the rapid photopolymerization rate, wavelength-orthogonal photoactivation, and observed photobleaching phenomenon. Ultimately, this visible-light-based printing method demonstrates: (i) rapid printing rate of 22.5&#160;mm h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, (ii) excellent feature resolution (&#8776;20&#160;&#181;m), and (iii) production of optically clear object with self-healing capability and spatially controlled cleavage. This study serves as a roadmap for developing next-generation &#8220;smart&#8221; 3D printing technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ln&#8208;MOF&#8208;Based Hydrogel Films with Tunable Luminescence and Afterglow Behavior for Visual Detection of Ofloxacin and Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A composite lanthanide MOF &#8211; carrageenan hydrogel material is prepared and its luminescent sensing properties towards ofloxacin antibiotic in raw meat are demonstrated. Hydrogel films based on bimetallic MOFs demonstrate tunable multicolor luminescence with the afterglow effect suitable for anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications.








Abstract
Highly selective and sensitive quantitative detection of ofloxacin (OFX) at ultralow concentrations in aqueous media and development of new afterglow materials remains a challenge. Herein, a new 2D water&#8208;stable lanthanide metal&#8211;organic framework (NIIC&#8208;2&#8208;Tb) is proposed, which exhibits high selectivity towards OFX through the luminescence quenching with the lowest detection limit (1.1&#160;&#215; 10&#8722;9 M) reported to date and a fast response within 6 s. In addition, the luminescent detection of OFX by NIIC&#8208;2&#8208;Tb is not affected by typical components of blood plasma and urine. The excellent sensing effect of NIIC&#8208;2&#8208;Tb is further utilized to prepare a composite functional sensing carrageenan hydrogel material for the rapid detection of OFX in meat in real time and the first discovery of impressive afterglow in MOF&#8208;based hydrogels. This study not only presents novel Ln&#8208;MOF materials and Ln&#8208;MOF&#8208;based hydrogel films for luminescent sensing of OFX, but also demonstrates color&#8208;tunable luminescent films with afterglow, which expands the application of composite luminescent materials for detection and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

         <title>Targeted Macrophage CRISPR&#8208;Cas13 mRNA Editing in Immunotherapy for Tendon Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conventional delivery methods of CRISPR&#8208;Cas13 fall short in addressing the heightened inflammatory response orchestrated by macrophages during the acute stages of tendon injury. This work furnishes a swift RNA editing strategy for macrophages in the inflammatory phase, triggered by ROS in tendon injury, along with a pioneering macrophage&#8208;targeted carrier proficient in delivering Cas13 into macrophages efficiently to alleviate inflammation.








Abstract
CRISPR&#8208;Cas13 holds substantial promise for tissue repair through its RNA editing capabilities and swift catabolism. However, conventional delivery methods fall short in addressing the heightened inflammatory response orchestrated by macrophages during the acute stages of tendon injury. In this investigation, macrophage&#8208;targeting cationic polymers are systematically screened to facilitate the entry of Cas13 ribonucleic&#8208;protein complex (Cas13 RNP) into macrophages. Notably, SPP1 (OPN encoding)&#8208;producing macrophages are recognized as a profibrotic subtype that emerges during the inflammatory stage. By employing ROS&#8208;responsive release mechanisms tailored for macrophage&#8208;targeted Cas13 RNP editing systems, the overactivation of SPP1 is curbed in the face of an acute immune microenvironment. Upon encapsulating this composite membrane around the tendon injury site, the macrophage&#8208;targeted Cas13 RNP effectively curtails the emergence of injury&#8208;induced SPP1&#8208;producing macrophages in the acute phase, leading to diminished fibroblast activation and mitigated peritendinous adhesion. Consequently, this study furnishes a swift RNA editing strategy for macrophages in the inflammatory phase triggered by ROS in tendon injury, along with a pioneering macrophage&#8208;targeted carrier proficient in delivering Cas13 into macrophages efficiently.

         <title>A Spiking Artificial Vision Architecture Based on Fully Emulating the Human Vision</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spiking&#8208;based artificial vision architecture consisting of event&#8208;based spiking photodetectors and artificial synapses is reported. The spiking photodetectors directly convert light into electrical spiking signals for artificial synapse&#8208;based neuromorphic computing. And the event&#8208;triggered mechanism greatly reduces the total power consumption. This fully emulated human vision architecture will effectively improve the performance of artificial vision systems.








Abstract
Intelligent vision necessitates the deployment of detectors that are always&#8208;on and low&#8208;power, mirroring the continuous and uninterrupted responsiveness characteristic of human vision. Nonetheless, contemporary artificial vision systems attain this goal by the continuous processing of massive image frames and executing intricate algorithms, thereby expending substantial computational power and energy. In contrast, biological data processing, based on event&#8208;triggered spiking, has higher efficiency and lower energy consumption. Here, this work proposes an artificial vision architecture consisting of spiking photodetectors and artificial synapses, closely mirroring the intricacies of the human visual system. Distinct from previously reported techniques, the photodetector is self&#8208;powered and event&#8208;triggered, outputting light&#8208;modulated spiking signals directly, thereby fulfilling the imperative for always&#8208;on with low&#8208;power consumption. With the spiking signals processing through the integrated synapse units, recognition of graphics, gestures, and human action has been implemented, illustrating the potent image processing capabilities inherent within this architecture. The results prove the 90% accuracy rate in human action recognition within a mere five epochs utilizing a rudimentary artificial neural network. This novel architecture, grounded in spiking photodetectors, offers a viable alternative to the extant models of always&#8208;on low&#8208;power artificial vision system.

         <title>Piezocatalytic Schottky Junction Treats Atherosclerosis by a Biomimetic Trojan Horse Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports on the engineering of a rod&#8208;like gold&#8208;zinc oxide (Au&#8208;ZnO) Schottky junction for enhanced piezocatalytic performance and camouflage with the macrophage membrane for improved biocompatibility and intraplaque enrichment. The obtained biomimetic Au&#8208;ZnO@MM promotes foamy macrophage apoptosis as well as cholesterol efflux and efferocytosis activated by apoptotic fragments, fulfilling amplified piezocatalytic atherosclerosis therapy by a biomimetic Trojan horse strategy.








Abstract
The atherosclerotic vulnerable plaque is characterized by the&#160;foamy macrophage burden, involving impaired cholesterol efflux and deficient efferocytosis. Correspondingly, piezocatalytic therapy is an emerging solution for eliminating the foamy macrophage burden with satisfactory spatiotemporal controllability and deep penetration depth. Herein, a biomimetic Trojan horse (Au&#8208;ZnO@MM) is engineered by coating the macrophage membrane (MM) onto the surface of a rod&#8208;like Au&#8208;ZnO Schottky Junction to effectively relieve the atherosclerotic progression. These Trojan horses with the coating of MM are actively transported into subsistent foamy macrophages and generate abundant reactive oxygen species (ROS) via ultrasound&#8208;activated piezocatalysis. ROS&#8208;initiated autophagy and mitochondrial dysfunction induce substantial cell apoptosis, alleviating the burden of subsistent foamy macrophages. The resulting apoptotic fragments further significantly facilitate cholesterol excretion and trigger efferocytosis of intraplaque fresh macrophages. Ultimately, the biomimetic Au&#8208;ZnO@MM piezocatalyst not only inhibits the foaming capacity of macrophages, but also improves the function of removing cell debris, which can stabilize atherosclerotic vulnerable plaque. Meanwhile, the plasmon resonance effect of integrated gold nanoparticles enables favorable photoacoustic molecular imaging for real&#8208;time image&#8208;guided atherosclerotic therapy. This proposed biomimetic Trojan horse strategy provides the paradigm of employing ultrasound&#8208;activated piezocatalytic methodology for enhanced atherosclerotic theranostics.

         <title>4D Multimaterial Printing of Soft Actuators with Spatial and Temporal Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the double&#8208;layer printed circuit board structure, a 4D printed multimaterial soft actuator that integrates a hydrophilic pH&#8208;responsive hydrogel and a hydrophobic shape&#8208;memory polymer with an adhesive layer to overcome poor interface compatibility, is designed. This integration enables active spatiotemporal control of actuation, while 4D printing facilitates a diverse range of configurations. 








Abstract
Soft actuators (SAs) are devices which can interact with delicate objects in a manner not achievable with traditional robotics. While it is possible to design a SA whose actuation is triggered via an external stimulus, the use of a single stimulus creates challenges in the spatial and temporal control of the actuation. Herein, a 4D printed multimaterial soft actuator design (MMSA) whose actuation is only initiated by a combination of triggers (i.e., pH and temperature) is presented. Using 3D printing, a multilayered soft actuator with a hydrophilic pH&#8208;sensitive layer, and a hydrophobic magnetic and temperature&#8208;responsive shape&#8208;memory polymer layer, is designed. The hydrogel responds to environmental pH conditions by swelling or shrinking, while the shape&#8208;memory polymer can resist the shape deformation of the hydrogel until triggered by temperature or light. The combination of these stimuli&#8208;responsive layers allows for a high level of spatiotemporal control of the actuation. The utility of the 4D MMSA is demonstrated via a series of cargo capture and release experiments, validating its ability to demonstrate active spatiotemporal control. The MMSA concept provides a promising research direction to develop multifunctional soft devices with potential applications in biomedical engineering and environmental engineering.

         <title>Isomerization of Benzothiadiazole Yields a Promising Polymer Donor and Organic Solar Cells with Efficiency of 19.0%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isomerization of 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole to 1,2,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole (iBT) in polymers can concurrently improve photon harvest, suppress nonradiative energy loss, and increase charge mobility. Consequently, the organic solar cells (OSCs) made with polymer PiBT donor and Y6 acceptor achieve efficiency of 19.0%, which is one of the highest efficiencies in binary OSCs. Polymer PiBT does broaden the family of efficient polymer donors.








Abstract
The exploration of high&#8208;performance and low&#8208;cost wide&#8208;bandgap polymer donors remains critical to achieve high&#8208;efficiency nonfullerene organic solar cells (OSCs) beyond current thresholds. Herein, the 1,2,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole (iBT), which is an isomer of 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole (BT), is used to design wide&#8208;bandgap polymer donor PiBT. The PiBT&#8208;based solar cells reach efficiency of 19.0%, which is one of the highest efficiencies in binary OSCs. Systemic studies show that isomerization of BT to iBT can finely regulate the polymers&#8217; photoelectric properties including i) increasing the extinction coefficient and photon harvest, ii) downshifting the highest occupied molecular orbital energy levels, iii) improving the coplanarity of polymer backbones, iv) offering good thermodynamic miscibility with acceptors. Consequently, the PiBT:Y6 bulk heterojunction (BHJ) device simultaneously reaches advantageous nanoscale morphology, efficient exciton generation and dissociation, fast charge transportation, and suppressed charge recombination, leading to larger VOC of 0.87&#160;V, higher JSC of 28.2 mA cm&#8722;2, greater fill factor of 77.3%, and thus higher efficiency of 19.0%, while the analog&#8208;PBT&#8208;based OSCs reach efficiency of only 12.9%. Moreover, the key intermediate iBT can be easily afforded from industry chemicals via two&#8208;step procedure. Overall, this contribution highlights that iBT is a promising motif for designing high&#8208;performance polymer donors.

         <title>Molecular Motor&#8208;Driven Light&#8208;Controlled Logic&#8208;Gated K+ Channel for Cancer Cell Apoptosis</title>

         <dc:description>
Deeply understanding the subtle dynamic behaviors of natural channel proteins based on artificial ion transport systems remains challenging. In this study, a molecular motor&#8208;derived photo&#8208;controlled logic&#8208;gated K+ channel resembling a multi&#8208;core processor is developed. The channel can step&#8208;wise control ion transport and anticancer treatments via executing logic gate instructions. Dramatic K+ efflux in the &#8220;ON&#8221; state significantly induces cancer cell apoptosis.








Abstract
Developing artificial ion transport systems, which process complicated information and step&#8208;wise regulate properties, is essential for deeply comprehending the subtle dynamic behaviors of natural channel proteins (NCPs). Here a photo&#8208;controlled logic&#8208;gated K+ channel based on single&#8208;chain random heteropolymers containing molecular motors, exhibiting multi&#8208;core processor&#8208;like properties to step&#8208;wise control ion transport is reported. Designed with oxygen, deoxygenation, and different wavelengths of light as input signals, complicated logical circuits comprising &#8220;YES&#8221;, &#8220;AND&#8221;, &#8220;OR&#8221; and &#8220;NOT&#8221; gate components are established. Implementing these logical circuits with K+ transport efficiencies as output signals, multiple state transitions including &#8220;ON&#8221;, &#8220;Partially OFF&#8221; and &#8220;Totally OFF&#8221; in liposomes and cancer cells are realized, further causing step&#8208;wise anticancer treatments. Dramatic K+ efflux in the &#8220;ON&#8221; state (decrease by 50% within 7&#160;min) significantly induces cancer cell apoptosis. This integrated logic&#8208;gated strategy will be expanded toward understanding the delicate mechanism underlying NCPs and treating cancer or other diseases is expected.

         <title>A Nanoscale Trans&#8208;Platinum(II)&#8208;Based Supramolecular Coordination Self&#8208;Assembly with a Distinct Anticancer Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanoscale trans&#8208;platinum(II)&#8208;based supramolecular coordination self&#8208;assembly Pt&#8211;tetracarboxylporphyrin (TCPP)&#8211;benzoic acid (BA) is synthesized. In presence of H2O2, Pt&#8211;TCPP&#8211;BA undergoes decomposition and generates bioactive trans&#8208;Pt(II) and TCPP&#8211;Pt species, which can induce unconventional interstrand cross&#8208;links and groove binding with DNA, respectively. These different mechanisms of action from cisplatin make Pt&#8211;TCPP&#8211;BA kill Pt&#8208;resistant cancer cells efficiently.








Abstract
Drug resistance significantly hampers the clinical application of existing platinum&#8208;based anticancer drugs. New platinum medications that possess distinct mechanisms of action are highly desired for the treatment of Pt&#8208;resistant cancers. Herein, a nanoscale trans&#8208;platinum(II)&#8208;based supramolecular coordination self&#8208;assembly (Pt&#8211;TCPP&#8211;BA) is prepared via using trans&#8208;[PtCl2(pyridine)(NH3)] (transpyroplatin), tetracarboxylporphyrin (TCPP), and benzoic acid (BA) as building blocks to combat drug resistance in platinum&#8208;based chemotherapy. Mechanistic studies indicate that Pt&#8211;TCPP&#8211;BA shows a hydrogen&#8208;peroxide&#8208;responsive dissociation behavior along with the generation of bioactive trans&#8208;Pt(II) and TCPP&#8211;Pt species. Different from cisplatin, these degradation products interact with DNA via interstrand cross&#8208;links and small groove binding, and induce significant upregulation of cell&#8208;death&#8208;related proteins such as p53, cleaved caspase 3, p21, and phosphorylated H2A histone family member X in cisplatin&#8208;resistant cancer cells. As a result, Pt&#8211;TCPP&#8211;BA exhibits potent killing effects against Pt&#8208;resistant tumors both in vitro and in vivo. Overall, this work not only provides a new platinum drug for combating drug&#8208;resistant cancer but also offers a new paradigm for the development of platinum&#8208;based supramolecular anticancer drugs.

         <title>Regenerated Graphite Electrodes with Reconstructed Solid Electrolyte Interface and Enclosed Active Lithium Toward &gt;100% Initial Coulombic Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ and fast solid electrolyte interface (SEI) engineering strategy (&lt;1 s) is proposed to efficiently convert degraded graphite into an air&#8208;stable, prelithiated, and regenerated material via reconstructing the original SEI and utilizing the residual active lithium, featuring significant environmental and economic advantages. This innovative approach holds the potential to efficiently propel the development of high&#8208;performance anodes.








Abstract
Solid electrolyte interface (SEI) is arguably the most important concern in graphite anodes, which determines their achievable Coulombic efficiency (CE) and cycling stability. In spent graphite anodes, there are already&#8208;formed (yet loose and/or broken) SEIs and some residual active lithium, which, if can be inherited in the regenerated electrodes, are highly desired to compensate for the lithium loss due to SEI formation. However, current graphite regenerated approaches easily destroy the thin SEIs and residue active lithium, making their reuse impossible. Herein, this work reports a fast&#8208;heating strategy (e.g., 1900 K for &#8776;150&#160;ms) to upcycle degraded graphite via instantly converting the loose original SEI layer (&#8776;100&#160;nm thick) to a compact and mostly inorganic one (&#8776;10&#8211;30&#160;nm thick with a 26X higher Young's Modulus) and still retaining the activity of residual lithium. Thanks to the robust SEI and enclosed active lithium, the regenerated graphite exhibited 104.7% initial CE for half&#8208;cell and gifted the full cells with LiFePO4 significantly improved initial CE (98.8%&#160;versus 83.2%) and energy density (309.4&#160;versus 281.4&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1), as compared with commercial graphite. The as&#8208;proposed upcycling strategy turns the &#8220;waste&#8221; graphite into high&#8208;value prelithiated ones, along with significant economic and environmental benefits.

         <title>Intergrating Hollow Multishelled Structure and High Entropy Engineering toward Enhanced Mechano&#8208;Electrochemical Properties in Lithium Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high entropy oxide (LiFeZnNiCoMn)3O4 hollow multishelled sphere (HEO&#8208;HoMS) with multiple electroactive elements is successfully developed. Benefiting from the delicate cocontrol from molecule to microstructure, HEO&#8208;HoMS provides impressively high specific capacity and long life span for lithium storage. This work may inspire more thoughts on rational multiscale design of conversion&#8208;type electrodes.








Abstract
Hollow multishelled structures (HoMSs) are attracting great interest in lithium&#8208;ion batteries as the conversion anodes, owing to their superior buffering effect and mechanical stability. Given the synthetic challenges, especially elemental diffusion barrier in the multimetal combinations, this complex structure design has been realized in low&#8208; and medium&#8208;entropy compounds so far. It means that poor reaction reversibility and low intrinsic conductivity remain largely unresolved. Here, a hollow multishelled (LiFeZnNiCoMn)3O4 high entropy oxide (HEO) is developed through integrating molecule and microstructure engineering. As expected, the HoMS design exhibits significant targeting functionality, yielding satisfactory structure and cycling stability. Meanwhile, the abundant oxygen defects and optimized electronic structure of HEO accelerate the lithiation kinetics, while the retention of the parent lattice matrix enables reversible lithium storage, which is validated by rigorous in situ tests and theoretical simulations. Benefiting from these combined properties, such hollow multishelled HEO anode can deliver a specific capacity of 967 mAh g&#8722;1 (89% capacity retention) after 500 cycles at 0.5 A g&#8722;1. The synergistic lattice and volume stability showcased in this work holds great promise in guiding the material innovations for the next&#8208;generation energy storage devices.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Epigenetically Relieving the MYC&#8208;Correlated Immunosuppression via an Advanced Nano&#8208;Radiosensitizer Potentiates Cancer Immuno&#8208;Radiotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radiotherapy causes patients severe MYC&#8208;mediated immune tolerance. To address this clinical issue, a high&#8208;Z metal&#8211;phenolic nanoradiosensitizer is engineered to dual&#8208;epigenetically downregulate MYC expression and trigger cancer cellular IFN&#8208;I signaling. This tactic significantly enhances the proliferation, intratumoral infiltration, and cytotoxicity of CD8+ T cells but decreases the levels of immune suppressors.








Abstract
Cancer cells can upregulate the MYC expression to repair the radiotherapy&#8208;triggered DNA damage, aggravating therapeutic resistance and tumor immunosuppression. Epigenetic treatment targeting the MYC&#8208;transcriptional abnormality may intensively solve this clinical problem. Herein, 5&#8208;Aza (a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor) and ITF&#8208;2357 (a histone deacetylase inhibitor) are engineered into a tungsten&#8208;based nano&#8208;radiosensitizer (PWAI), to suppress MYC rising and awaken robust radiotherapeutic antitumor immunity. Individual 5&#8208;Aza depletes MYC expression but cannot efficiently awaken radiotherapeutic immunity. This drawback can be overcome by the addition of ITF&#8208;2357, which triggers cancer cellular type I interferon (IFN&#8208;I) signaling. Coupling 5&#8208;Aza with ITF&#8208;2357 ensures that PWAI does not evoke the treated model with high MYC&#8208;related immune resistance while amplifying the radiotherapeutic tumor killing, and more importantly promotes the generation of IFN&#8208;I signal&#8208;related proteins involving IFN&#8208;&#945; and IFN&#8208;&#946;. Unlike the radiation treatment alone, PWAI&#8208;triggered immuno&#8208;radiotherapy remarkably enhances antitumor immune responses involving the tumor antigen presentation by dendritic cells, and improves intratumoral recruitment of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and their memory&#8208;phenotype formation in 4T1 tumor&#8208;bearing mice. Downgrading the radiotherapy&#8208;induced MYC overexpression via the dual&#8208;epigenetic reprogramming strategy may elicit a robust immuno&#8208;radiotherapy.

         <title>A Hybrid Pulsed Laser Deposition Approach to Grow Thin Films of Chalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Epitaxial growth of vapor&#8208;pressure mismatched materials is challenging due to differences in the reactivity, and surface adatom sticking and mobility. A novel approach &#8212;hybrid pulsed laser deposition&#8212;wherein an organosulfur precursor delivery is combined with pulsed laser deposition is used to grow several sulfides as epitaxial or textured thin films with superior crystallinity compared to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art. 








Abstract
Vapor&#8208;pressure mismatched materials such as transition metal chalcogenides have emerged as electronic, photonic, and quantum materials with scientific and technological importance. However, epitaxial growth of vapor&#8208;pressure mismatched materials are challenging due to differences in the reactivity, sticking coefficient, and surface adatom mobility of the mismatched species constituting the material, especially sulfur containing compounds. Here, a novel approach is reported to grow chalcogenides&#8212;hybrid pulsed laser deposition&#8212;wherein an organosulfur precursor is used as a sulfur source in conjunction with pulsed laser deposition to regulate the stoichiometry of the deposited films. Epitaxial or textured thin films of sulfides with variety of structure and chemistry such as alkaline metal chalcogenides, main group chalcogenides, transition metal chalcogenides, and chalcogenide perovskites are demonstrated, and structural characterization reveal improvement in thin film crystallinity, and surface and interface roughness compared to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art. The growth method can be broadened to other vapor&#8208;pressure mismatched chalcogenides such as selenides and tellurides. This work opens up opportunities for broader epitaxial growth of chalcogenides, especially sulfide&#8208;based thin film technological applications.

         <title>Dynamic Optical Encryption Fueled via Tunable Mechanical Composite Micrograting Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a dynamic optical encryption strategy using tunable mechanical composite wrinkle micrograting encryption systems (MCWGES). By generating dynamic keys with large space capacity for encrypted diffraction patterns, MCWGES effectively prevents eavesdropping, damage, and tampering. The proposed approach demonstrates the potential applications of micro/nanostructured functional surfaces in information security.








Abstract

&lt;p&gt;Optical grating devices based on micro/nanostructured functional surfaces are widely employed to precisely manipulate light propagation, which is significant for information technologies, optical data storage, and light sensors. However, the parameters of rigid periodic structures are difficult to tune after manufacturing, which seriously limits their capacity for in situ light manipulation. Here, a novel anti-eavesdropping, anti-damage, and anti-tamper dynamic optical encryption strategy are reported via tunable mechanical composite wrinkle micrograting encryption systems (MCWGES). By mechanically composing multiple in-situ tunable ordered wrinkle gratings, the dynamic keys with large space capacity are generated to obtain encrypted diffraction patterns, which can provide a higher level of security for the encrypted systems. Furthermore, a multiple grating cone diffraction model is proposed to reveal the dynamic optical encryption principle of MCWGES.

         <title>Stretchable Device for Simultaneous Measurements of Contractility and Electrophysiology of Neuromuscular Tissue in the Gastrointestinal Tract</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stretchable electrode made from poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is demonstrated for simultaneous monitoring of electrical and mechanical responses in dynamic neuromuscular gastrointestinal tissues. The devices are fabricated using shadow masks and solution&#8208;processing techniques, providing a faster and simpler process than traditional lithography.








Abstract
Devices interfacing with biological tissues can provide valuable insights into function, disease, and metabolism through electrical and mechanical signals. However, certain neuromuscular tissues, like those in the gastrointestinal tract, undergo significant strains of up to 40%. Conventional inextensible devices cannot capture the dynamic responses in these tissues. This study introduces electrodes made from poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) that enable simultaneous monitoring of electrical and mechanical responses of gut tissue. The soft PDMS layers conform to tissue surfaces during gastrointestinal movement. Dopants, including Capstone FS&#8208;30 and polyethylene glycol, are explored to enhance the conductivity, electrical sensitivity to strain, and stability of the PEDOT:PSS. The devices are fabricated using shadow masks and solution&#8208;processing techniques, providing a faster and simpler process than traditional clean&#8208;room&#8208;based lithography. Tested on ex vivo mouse colon and human stomach, the device recorded voltage changes of up to 300 &#181;V during contraction and distension consistent with muscle activity, while simultaneously recording resistance changes of up to 150% due to mechanical strain. These devices detect and respond to chemical stimulants and blockers, and can induce contractions through electrical stimulation. They hold great potential for studying and treating complex disorders like irritable bowel syndrome and gastroparesis.

         <title>Graphene and MOF Assembly: Enhanced Fabrication and Functional Derivative via MOF Amorphization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The assembly of graphene&#8208;MOFs (MOFs, metal&#8211;organic frameworks) carries substantial implications across diverse domains. This work provides an efficient fabrication of graphene&#8208;MOFs assembly, uncovers critical mechanisms underlying the assembly efficiency, and showcases the assembly's versatility in electrocatalysis through MOF amorphization. By doing so, it is aimed to open up new avenues for graphene&#8208;MOFs in advancing the field of electrocatalysis and beyond.








Abstract
The integration of graphene and metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) has numerous implications across various domains, but fabricating such assemblies is often complicated and time&#8208;consuming. Herein, a one&#8208;step preparation of graphene&#8208;MOF assembly is presented by directly impregnating vertical graphene (VG) arrays into the zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) precursors under ambient conditions. This approach can effectively assemble multiple ZIFs, including ZIF&#8208;7, ZIF&#8208;8, and ZIF&#8208;67, resulting in their uniform dispersion on the VG with adjustable sizes and shapes. Hydrogen defects on the VG surface are critical in inducing such high&#8208;efficiency ZIF assembly, acting as the reactive sites to interact with the ZIF precursors and facilitate their crystallisation. The versatility of VG&#8208;ZIF&#8208;67 assembly is further demonstrated&#160;by exploring the process of MOF amorphization. Surprisingly, this process leads to an amorphous thin&#8208;film coating formed on VG (named VG&#8208;IL&#8208;amZIF&#8208;67), which preserves the short&#8208;range molecular bonds of crystalline ZIF&#8208;67 while sacrificing the long&#8208;range order. Such a unique film&#8208;on&#8208;graphene architecture maintains the essential characteristics and functionalities of ZIF&#8208;67 within a disordered arrangement, making it well&#8208;suited for electrocatalysis. In electrochemical oxygen reduction, VG&#8208;IL&#8208;amZIF&#8208;67 exhibits exceptional activity, selectivity, and stability to produce H2O2 in acid media.

         <title>Carboxylating Elastomer via Thiol&#8208;Ene Click Reaction to Improve Miscibility with Conjugated Polymers for Mechanically Robust Organic Solar Cells with Efficiency of 19%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective strategy to enhance the miscibility between the conjugated polymer PM6 and the insulating elastomer styrene&#8208;butadiene&#8208;styrene (SBS) has been developed by incorporating carboxyl groups into SBS (SBS&#8208;COOH), resulting in optimized mechanical properties and morphology of PM6. A remarkable power conversion efficiency of 19.04% is achieved for organic solar cells with 5% SBS&#8208;COOH (PM6:L8&#8208;BO system), outperforming devices of PM6:L8&#8208;BO without or with SBS.








Abstract
Incorporating flexible insulating polymers is a straightforward strategy to enhance the mechanical properties of rigid conjugated polymers, enabling their use in flexible electronic devices. However, maintaining electronic characteristics simultaneously is challenging due to the poor miscibility between insulating polymers and conjugated polymers. This study introduces the carboxylation of insulating polymers as an effective strategy to enhance miscibility with conjugated polymers via surface energy modulation and hydrogen bonding. The carboxylated elastomer, synthesized via a thiol&#8208;ene click reaction, closely matches the surface energy of the conjugated polymer. This significantly improves the mechanical properties, achieving a high crack&#8208;onset strain of 21.48%, surpassing that (5.93%) of the unmodified elastomer:conjugated polymer blend. Upon incorporating the carboxylated elastomer into PM6:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based organic solar cells, an impressive power conversion efficiency of 19.04% is attained, which top&#8208;performs among insulating polymer&#8208;incorporated devices and outperforms devices with unmodified elastomer or neat PM6:L8&#8208;BO. The superior efficiency is attributed to the optimized microstructures and enhanced crystallinity for efficient and balanced charge transport, and suppressed charge recombination. Furthermore, flexible devices with 5% carboxylated elastomer exhibit superior mechanical stability, retaining &#8776;88.9% of the initial efficiency after 40&#160;000 bending cycles at a 1&#160;mm radius, surpassing &#8776;83.5% for devices with 5% unmodified elastomer.

         <title>Three&#8208;in&#8208;One Strategy Enables Single&#8208;Component Organic Solar Cells with Record Efficiency and High Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>

This work proposes a facile three&#8208;in&#8208;one strategy by fusing the advantages of ternary blend system and single&#8208;component system for stable and efficient orgainic solar cells. The PM6&#8208;D18&#8208;b&#8208;PYIT&#8208;10&#8208;based three&#8208;in&#8208;one single&#8208;component device not only obtains a breakthrough efficiency of 14.89%, but also displays significantly higher stability than the corresponding two&#8208;component (PM6&#8208;D18:PYIT) and three&#8208;component (PM6:D18:PYIT), including the photostability, storage stability, and thermal stability.








Abstract
Single&#8208;component organic solar cells (SCOSCs) with covalently bonding donor and acceptor are becoming increasingly attractive because of their superior stability over traditional multicomponent blend organic solar cells (OSCs). Nevertheless, the efficiency of SCOSCs is far behind the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art multicomponent OSCs. Herein, by combination of the advantages of three&#8208;component and single&#8208;component devices, this work reports an innovative three&#8208;in&#8208;one strategy to boost the performance of SCOSCs. In this three&#8208;in&#8208;one strategy, three independent components (PM6, D18, and PYIT) are covalently linked together to create a new single&#8208;component active layer based on ternary conjugated block copolymer (TCBC) PM6&#8208;D18&#8208;b&#8208;PYIT by a facile polymerization. Precisely manipulating the component ratios in the polymer chains of PM6&#8208;D18&#8208;b&#8208;PYIT is able to broaden light utilization, promote charge dynamics, optimize, and stabilize film morphology, contributing to the simultaneously enhanced efficiency and stability of the SCOSCs. Ultimately, the PM6&#8208;D18&#8208;b&#8208;PYIT&#8208;based device exhibits a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.89%, which is the highest efficiency of the reported SCOSCs. Thanks to the aggregation restriction of each component and chain entanglement in the three&#8208;in&#8208;one system, the PM6&#8208;D18&#8208;b&#8208;PYIT&#8208;based SCOSC displays significantly higher stability than the corresponding two&#8208;component (PM6&#8208;D18:PYIT) and three&#8208;component (PM6:D18:PYIT).

     alt="Three-in-One Strategy Enables Single-Component Organic Solar Cells with Record Efficiency and High Stability"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work proposes a facile three-in-one strategy by fusing the advantages of ternary blend system and single-component system for stable and efficient orgainic solar cells. The PM6-D18&lt;i&gt;-b-&lt;/i&gt;PYIT-10-based three-in-one single-component device not only obtains a breakthrough efficiency of 14.89%, but also displays significantly higher stability than the corresponding two-component (PM6-D18:PYIT) and three-component (PM6:D18:PYIT), including the photostability, storage stability, and thermal stability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single-component organic solar cells (SCOSCs) with covalently bonding donor and acceptor are becoming increasingly attractive because of their superior stability over traditional multicomponent blend organic solar cells (OSCs). Nevertheless, the efficiency of SCOSCs is far behind the state-of-the-art multicomponent OSCs. Herein, by combination of the advantages of three-component and single-component devices, this work reports an innovative three-in-one strategy to boost the performance of SCOSCs. In this three-in-one strategy, three independent components (PM6, D18, and PYIT) are covalently linked together to create a new single-component active layer based on ternary conjugated block copolymer (TCBC) PM6-D18&lt;i&gt;-b-&lt;/i&gt;PYIT by a facile polymerization. Precisely manipulating the component ratios in the polymer chains of PM6-D18&lt;i&gt;-b-&lt;/i&gt;PYIT is able to broaden light utilization, promote charge dynamics, optimize, and stabilize film morphology, contributing to the simultaneously enhanced efficiency and stability of the SCOSCs. Ultimately, the PM6-D18&lt;i&gt;-b-&lt;/i&gt;PYIT-based device exhibits a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.89%, which is the highest efficiency of the reported SCOSCs. Thanks to the aggregation restriction of each component and chain entanglement in the three-in-one system, the PM6-D18&lt;i&gt;-b-&lt;/i&gt;PYIT-based SCOSC displays significantly higher stability than the corresponding two-component (PM6-D18:PYIT) and three-component (PM6:D18:PYIT). These results demonstrate that the three-in-one strategy is facile and promising for developing SCOSCs with superior efficiency and stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The utilization of photothermal assistance principle presents significant opportunities for exploring the relationship between the photothermal effect of catalyst and their as&#8208;tuned comprehensive zinc&#8208;air battery (ZAB) properties at both normal and extreme working conditions (e.g., low temperature and deformation), and bridging the long&#8208;existing gap between the underlying mechanism of photothermal effect and advanced light&#8208;heat&#8208;electric&#8208;chemical energy conversion.








Abstract
Despite the increasing effort in advancing oxygen electrocatalysts for zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs), the performance development gradually reaches a plateau via only ameliorating the electrocatalyst materials. Herein, a new class of external field&#8208;responsive electrocatalyst comprising Ni0.5Mn0.5Fe2O4 stably dispersed on N&#8208;doped Ketjenblack (Ni0.5Mn0.5Fe2O4/N&#8208;KB) is developed via polymer&#8208;assisted strategy for practical ZABs. Briefly, the activity indicator &#916;E is significantly decreased to 0.618&#160;V upon photothermal assistance, far exceeding most reported electrocatalysts (generally &gt;0.680&#160;V). As a result, the photothermal electrocatalyst possesses comprehensive merits of excellent power density (319&#160;mW cm&#8722;2), ultralong lifespan (5163 cycles at 25&#160;mA cm&#8722;2), and outstanding rate performance (100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) for liquid ZABs, and superb temperature and deformation adaptability for flexible ZABs. Such improvement is attributed to the photothermal&#8208;heating&#8208;enabled synergy of promoted electrical conductivity, reactant&#8208;molecule motion, active area, and surface reconstruction, as revealed by operando Raman and simulation. The findings open vast possibilities toward more&#8208;energy&#8208;efficient energy applications.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Functional Spirobifluorene Phosphonate Based Exciplex Interface Enables Voc Reaching 95% of Theoretical Limit for Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An exciplex interface is developed by the designed and synthesized spirobifluorene phosphonate molecules to mitigate VOC loss in perovskite solar cells. The multi&#8208;functional spirobifluorene phosphonate based exciplex interface can promote hole extraction by donor&#8211;acceptor interaction, optimize energy band alignment, and reduce defect&#8208;induced recombination. A record VOC reaching 95% of theoretical limit and a high efficiency are achieved.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) show significant advancements in power conversion efficiency (PCE). However, the open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of PSCs is limited by interfacial factors such as defect&#8208;induced recombination, energy band mismatch, and non&#8208;intimate interface contact. Here, an exciplex interface is first developed based on the strategically designed and synthesized two spirobifluorene phosphonate molecules to mitigate VOC loss in PSCs. The exciplex interface constructed by the intimate contact between the multi&#8208;functional molecules and hole transport layer takes the roles to promote the hole extraction by donor&#8211;acceptor interaction, passivate coordination&#8208;unsaturated Pb2+ defects by equipped phosphonate groups, and optimize the energy level alignment. As a result, a record VOC of 1.26&#160;V with a perovskite bandgap of 1.61&#160;eV is achieved, representing over 95% of theoretical limit. This advancement leads to an increase in PCE from 21.29% to 24.12% and improved stability. The exciplex interface paves the way for addressing the long&#8208;standing challenge of VOC loss and promotes the wider application of PSCs.

         <title>A Fluoride&#8208;Rich Solid&#8208;Like Electrolyte Stabilizing Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A solid&#8208;like electrolyte is presented to enhance the overall performance of rechargeable Li&#8211;metal batteries. The triflate groups in its channels facilitate the formation of a functional inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase that effectively stabilizes Li metal anodes. Besides, these triflate groups contribute to the decoupling of Li+ and provide hopping sites for rapid Li+ transport.








Abstract
To address the problems associated with Li metal anodes, a fluoride&#8208;rich solid&#8208;like electrolyte (SLE) that combines the benefits of solid&#8208;state and liquid electrolytes is presented. Its unique triflate&#8208;group&#8208;enhanced frame channels facilitate the formation of a functional inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), which not only improves the reversibility and interfacial charge transfer of Li anodes but also ensures uniform and compact Li deposition. Furthermore, these triflate groups contribute to the decoupling of Li+ and provide hopping sites for rapid Li+ transport, enabling a high room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity of 1.1 mS cm&#8722;1 and a low activation energy of 0.17&#160;eV, making it comparable to conventional liquid electrolytes. Consequently, Li symmetric cells using such SLE achieve extremely stable plating/stripping cycling over 3500&#160;h at 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and support a high critical current up to 2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The assembled Li||LiFePO4 solid&#8208;like batteries exhibit exceptional cyclability for over 1 year and a half, even outperforming liquid cells. Additionally, high&#8208;voltage cylindrical cells and high&#8208;capacity pouch cells are demonstrated, corroborating much simpler processibility in battery assembly compared to all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>Downsizing Porphyrin Covalent Organic Framework Particles Using Protected Precursors for Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Downsized particles of a porphyrin covalent organic framework are synthesized using a tritylated amine as a protected precursor. The downsized particles exhibit superior catalytic performance in electrochemical CO2 reduction because of the larger contact area with a conductive agent. This study reveals the importance of particle size and its control strategy in covalent organic framework catalysts.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising electrocatalyst platforms owing to their designability, porosity, and stability. Recently, COFs with various chemical structures are developed as efficient electrochemical CO2 reduction catalysts. However, controlling the morphology of COF catalysts remains a challenge, which can limit their electrocatalytic performance. Especially, while porphyrin COFs show promising catalytic properties, their particle size is mostly large and uncontrolled because of the severe aggregation of crystallites. In this work, a new synthetic methodology for rationally downsized COF catalyst particles is reported, where a tritylated amine is employed as a novel protected precursor for COF synthesis. Trityl protection provides high solubility to a porphyrin precursor, while its deprotection proceeds in situ under typical COF synthesis conditions. Subsequent homogeneous nucleation and colloidal growth yield smaller COF particles than a conventional synthesis, owing to suppressed crystallite aggregation. The downsized COF particles exhibit superior catalytic performance in electrochemical CO2 reduction, with higher CO production rate and faradaic efficiency compared to conventional COF particles. The improved performance is attributed to the higher contact area with a conductive agent. This study reveals particle size as an important factor for the evaluation of COF electrocatalysts and provides a strategy to control it.

     alt="Downsizing Porphyrin Covalent Organic Framework Particles Using Protected Precursors for Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Downsized particles of a porphyrin covalent organic framework are synthesized using a tritylated amine as a protected precursor. The downsized particles exhibit superior catalytic performance in electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction because of the larger contact area with a conductive agent. This study reveals the importance of particle size and its control strategy in covalent organic framework catalysts.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising electrocatalyst platforms owing to their designability, porosity, and stability. Recently, COFs with various chemical structures are developed as efficient electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction catalysts. However, controlling the morphology of COF catalysts remains a challenge, which can limit their electrocatalytic performance. Especially, while porphyrin COFs show promising catalytic properties, their particle size is mostly large and uncontrolled because of the severe aggregation of crystallites. In this work, a new synthetic methodology for rationally downsized COF catalyst particles is reported, where a tritylated amine is employed as a novel protected precursor for COF synthesis. Trityl protection provides high solubility to a porphyrin precursor, while its deprotection proceeds in situ under typical COF synthesis conditions. Subsequent homogeneous nucleation and colloidal growth yield smaller COF particles than a conventional synthesis, owing to suppressed crystallite aggregation. The downsized COF particles exhibit superior catalytic performance in electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction, with higher CO production rate and faradaic efficiency compared to conventional COF particles. The improved performance is attributed to the higher contact area with a conductive agent. This study reveals particle size as an important factor for the evaluation of COF electrocatalysts and provides a strategy to control it.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Catalytic Nanodots&#8208;Driven Pyroptosis Suppression in Nucleus Pulposus for Antioxidant Intervention of Intervertebral Disc Degeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Considering that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are the primary instigators of pyroptosis and lack pharmacological intervention, advanced carbonized Mn&#8208;containing nanodots (MCDs) are developed as ROS&#8208;scavenging biomaterials to efficiently suppress pyroptosis in nucleus pulposus (NP) cells and maintain NP tissue homeostasis for potential intervention in intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD).








Abstract
Low back pain resulting from intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) is a prevalent global concern; however, its underlying mechanism remains elusive. Single&#8208;cell sequencing analyses revealed the critical involvement of pyroptosis in IVDD. Considering the involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as the primary instigator of pyroptosis and the lack of an efficient intervention approach, this study developed carbonized Mn&#8208;containing nanodots (MCDs) as ROS&#8208;scavenging catalytic biomaterials to suppress pyroptosis of nucleus pulposus (NP) cells to efficiently alleviate IVDD. Catalytic MCDs have superior efficacy in scavenging intracellular ROS and rescuing homeostasis in the NP microenvironment compared with N&#8208;acetylcysteine, a classical antioxidant. The data validates that pyroptosis plays a vital role in mediating the protective effects of catalytic MCDs against oxidative stress. Systematic in vivo assessments substantiate the effectiveness of MCDs in rescuing a puncture&#8208;induced IVDD rat model, further demonstrating their ability to suppress pyroptosis. This study highlights the potential of antioxidant catalytic nanomedicine as a pyroptosis inhibitor and mechanistically unveils an efficient strategy for the treatment of IVDD.

         <title>Pre&#8208;Endcapping of Hyperbranched Polymers toward Intrinsically Stretchable Semiconductors with Good Ductility and Carrier Mobility</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;pre&#8208;endcapping&#8221; hyperbranched strategy is proposed for the development of intrinsically stretchable semiconducting polymers. This approach hinders the formation of a homogeneous backbone and promotes the formation of small crystalline domains. The topology network establishes through endcapping branching not only enhances isotropic charge transport but also ensures tensile resistance. This strategy presents a promising approach for designing advanced intrinsically stretchable semiconductors.








Abstract
The advancement of semiconducting polymers stands as a pivotal milestone in the quest to realize wearable electronics. Nonetheless, endowing semiconductor polymers with stretchability without compromising their carrier mobility remains a formidable challenge. This study proposes a &#8220;pre&#8208;endcapping&#8221; strategy for synthesizing hyperbranched semiconducting polymers (HBSPs), aiming to achieve the balance between carrier mobility and stretchability for organic electronics. The findings unveil that the aggregates formed by the endcapped hyperbranched network structure not only ensure efficient charge transport but also demonstrate superior tensile resistance. In comparison to linear conjugated polymers, HBSPs exhibit substantially larger crack onset strains and notably diminished tensile moduli. It is evident that the HBSPs surpass their linear counterparts in terms of both their semiconducting and mechanical properties. Among HBSPs, HBSP&#8208;72h&#8208;2.5 stands out as the preeminent candidate within the field of inherently stretchable semiconducting polymers, maintaining 93% of its initial mobility even when subjected to 100% strain (1.41&#160;&#177;&#160;0.206&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1). Furthermore, thin film devices of HBSP&#8208;72h&#8208;2.5 remain stable after undergoing repeated stretching and releasing cycles. Notably, the mobilities are independent of the stretching directions, showing isotropic charge transport behavior. The preliminary study makes this &#8220;pre&#8208;endcapping&#8221; strategy a potential candidate for the future design of organic materials for flexible electronic devices.

         <title>Achieving Stable Lithium Anodes through Leveraging Inevitable Stress Variations via Adaptive Piezoelectric Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanical failures stemming from substantial volume fluctuations and stress concentration pose formidable challenges for lithium&#8208;metal batteries. To address this, the piezoelectric effect to transform these stresses into robust, responsive, and highly sensitive built&#8208;in electric fields is introduced. This work provides crucial insights in managing mechanical failures, and significantly contributes to characterizing and visualizing latent issues in lithium&#8208;metal batteries.








Abstract
Unleashing the potential of lithium&#8208;metal anodes in practical applications is hindered by the inherent stress&#8208;related challenges arising from their limitless volume expansion, leading to mechanical failures such as electrode cracking, solid electrolyte interphase damage, and dendritic growth.&#160;Despite the various protective strategies to &#8220;combat&#8221; stress in lithium&#8208;metal anodes, they fail to address the intrinsic issue fundamentally. Here, a unique strategy is proposed that leverages the stress generated during the battery cycling via the piezoelectric effect, transforming to the adaptive built&#8208;in electric field to accelerate lithium&#8208;ion migration, homogenize the lithium deposition, and alleviate the stress concentration. The mechanism of the piezoelectric effect in modulating electro&#8208;chemomechanical field evolution is further validated and decoupled through finite element method simulations. Inspired by this strategy, a high sensitivity, fast responsive, and strength adaptability polymer piezoelectric is used to demonstrate the feasibility and the corresponding protected lithium&#8208;metal anode shows cycling stability over 6000&#160;h under a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and extending life in a variety of coin and pouch cell systems. This work effectively tackles the stress&#8208;related issues and decoupling the electro&#8208;chemomechanical field evolution also contributes to developing more stable lithium anodes for future research.

         <title>A High&#8208;Energy Tellurium Redox&#8208;Amphoteric Conversion Cathode Chemistry for Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tellurium redox&#8208;amphoteric conversion cathode chemistry is demonstrated for aqueous zinc batteries with a highly concentrated ZnCl2 electrolyte, achieving a specific capacity of 1223.9 mAh gTe&#8722;1 and an outstanding energy density of 1028.0&#160;Wh kgTe&#8722;1. The reversible six&#8208;electron Te2&#8722;/Te0/Te4+ conversion is disclosed with TeCl4 as the fully charged product and ZnTe as the fully discharged product.








Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous zinc batteries are potential candidates for sustainable energy storage systems at a grid scale, owing to their high safety and low cost. However, the existing cathode chemistries exhibit restricted energy density, which hinders their extensive applications. Here, a tellurium redox&#8208;amphoteric conversion cathode chemistry is presented for aqueous zinc batteries, which delivers a specific capacity of 1223.9 mAh gTe&#8722;1 and a high energy density of 1028.0&#160;Wh kgTe&#8722;1. A highly concentrated electrolyte (30&#160;mol kg&#8722;1 ZnCl2) is revealed crucial for initiating the Te redox&#8208;amphoteric conversion as it suppresses the H2O reactivity and inhibits undesirable hydrolysis of the Te4+ product. By carrying out multiple operando/ex situ characterizations, the reversible six&#8208;electron Te2&#8722;/Te0/Te4+ conversion with TeCl4 is identified as the fully charged product and ZnTe as the fully discharged product. This finding not only enriches the conversion&#8208;type battery chemistries but also establishes a critical step in exploring redox&#8208;amphoteric materials for aqueous zinc batteries and beyond.

By carrying out multiple operando/ex situ characterizations, the reversible six-electron Te&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/Te&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;/Te&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; conversion with TeCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is identified as the fully charged product and ZnTe as the fully discharged product. This finding not only enriches the conversion-type battery chemistries but also establishes a critical step in exploring redox-amphoteric materials for aqueous zinc batteries and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>HLCT&#8208;Type Acceptor Molecule&#8208;Based Exciplex System for Highly Efficient Solution&#8208;Processable OLEDs with Suppressed Efficiency Roll&#8208;Offs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two HLCT emitters are synthesized as acceptor molecules in the exciplex system. By using the exciplex system as an emitter, a solution&#8208;processable organic light&#8208;emitting diode achieves a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 20.8%. Furthermore, a high EQEmax &gt; 25% with a very low&#8208;efficiency roll&#8208;off is obtained for solution&#8208;processable phosphorescent devices using the exciplex as a host matrix for phosphors.








Abstract
Exciplex systems are promising candidates for thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules because of the small energy difference between the lowest singlet and triplet excited states (&#916;EST). However, realizing high&#8208;efficiency and low&#8208;external&#8208;quantum&#8208;efficiency (EQE) roll&#8208;off in solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) using an exciplex system remains a formidable challenge. In this study, two (HLCT)&#8208;type isomers with a spiro skeleton, 2&#8208;tBuspoCz&#8208;TRZ and 10&#8208;tBuspoCz&#8208;TRZ, are designed and synthesized as acceptors of exciplexes, where tert&#8208;butylspirofluorene indole is regarded as a donor and the triazine unit as an acceptor. Green exciplex emissions are observed for the 2&#8208;tBuspoCz&#8208;TRZ:TAPC and 10&#8208;tBuspoCz&#8208;TRZ:TAPC exciplexes, indicating distinct TADF characteristics with a very small &#916;EST of 35 &#177; 5 meV. By using the TADF exciplex system based on the HLCT acceptor as an emitter, solution&#8208;processable OLEDs achieve a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 20.8%. Furthermore, a high EQEmax &gt; 25% with a very low&#8208;efficiency roll&#8208;off (&#8776;3.5% at 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2) is obtained for solution&#8208;processable phosphorescent devices using HLCT&#8208;based exciplexes as the host matrix of phosphors. This study paves the way for a novel strategy for designing acceptor exciplex molecules for effective TADF molecules and host matrices in solution&#8208;processable OLEDs.

         <title>Establishing Pinhole Deposition Mode of Zn via Scalable Monolayer Graphene Film</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Probing the specific role of graphene layer for Zn deposition is realized by high&#8208;quality graphene transfer, showcasing that the low lattice mismatch is barely a decisive factor for ideal epitaxial deposition and that the monolayer transferred graphene creates a unique pinhole deposition pattern, which harvests satisfactory battery lifespan






.

Abstract
The uneven texture evolution of Zn during electrodeposition would adversely impact upon the lifespan of aqueous Zn metal batteries. To address this issue, tremendous endeavors are made to induce Zn(002) orientational deposition employing graphene and its derivatives. Nevertheless, the effect of prototype graphene film over Zn deposition behavior has garnered less attention. Here, it is attempted to solve such a puzzle via utilizing transferred high&#8208;quality graphene film with controllable layer numbers in a scalable manner on a Zn foil. The multilayer graphene fails to facilitate a Zn epitaxial deposition, whereas the monolayer film with slight breakages steers a unique pinhole deposition mode. In&#8208;depth electrochemical measurements and theoretical simulations discover that the transferred graphene film not only acts as an armor to inhibit side reactions but also serves as a buffer layer to homogenize initial Zn nucleation and decrease Zn migration barrier, accordingly enabling a smooth deposition layer with closely stacked polycrystalline domains. As a result, both assembled symmetric and full cells manage to deliver satisfactory electrochemical performances. This study proposes a concept of &#8220;pinhole deposition&#8221; to dictate Zn electrodeposition and broadens the horizons of graphene&#8208;modified Zn anodes.

         <title>Electrochemically Exfoliated Graphene Additive&#8208;Free Inks for 3D Printing Customizable Monolithic Integrated Micro&#8208;Supercapacitors on a Large Scale</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cost&#8208;effective, additive&#8208;free, highly robust, and environmentally friendly graphene ink is demonstrated for large&#8208;scale 3D printed MSCs, showing extremely high areal and volumetric energy density, high temperature stability, and good integration. This work provides a great reference value for the commercialization of graphene in the field of 3D printing.








Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) printing technology with enhanced fidelity can achieve multiple functionalities and boost electrochemical performance of customizable planar micro&#8208;supercapacitors (MSCs), however, precise structural control of additive&#8208;free graphene&#8208;based macro&#8208;assembly electrode for monolithic integrated MSCs (MIMSCs) remains challenging. Here, the large&#8208;scale 3D printing fabrication of customizable planar MIMSCs is reported utilizing additive&#8208;free, high&#8208;quality electrochemically exfoliated graphene inks, which is not required the conventional cryogenic assistance during the printing process and any post&#8208;processing reduction. The resulting MSCs reveal an extremely small engineering footprint of 0.025&#160;cm2, exceptionally high areal capacitance of 4900&#160;mF&#160;cm&#8722;2, volumetric capacitance of 195.6&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;3, areal energy density of 2.1&#160;mWh&#160;cm&#8722;2, and unprecedented volumetric energy density of 23&#160;mWh&#160;cm&#8722;3 for a single cell, surpassing most previously reported 3D printed MSCs. The 3D printed MIMSC pack is further demonstrated, with the maximum areal cell count density of 16&#160;cell&#160;cm&#8722;2, the highest output voltage of 192.5&#160;V and the largest output voltage per unit area of 56&#160;V&#160;cm&#8722;2 up to date are achieved. This work presents an innovative solution for processing high&#8208;performance additive&#8208;free graphene ink and realizing the large&#8208;scale production of 3D printed MIMSCs for planar energy storage.

         <title>Synergy of Dendrites&#8208;Impeded Atomic Clusters Dissociation and Side Reactions Suppressed Inert Interface Protection for Ultrastable Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional composite interphase of Bi/Bi2O3 is in situ designed on Zn anode, for the first time initiating a synergistic modulation mechanism: the innovative thermodynamically favorable Zn atomic clusters dissociation mechanism inhibiting dendrites formation and chemically inert interface protection mechanism alleviating interfacial side reactions. Eventually, Zn@Bi/Bi2O3 electrode exhibits remarkably prominent cyclic performance both in symmetry cells system and practical full cells system.








Abstract
The sluggish ions&#8208;transfer and inhomogeneous ions&#8208;nucleation induce the formation of randomly oriented dendrites on Zn anode, while the chemical instability at anode&#8211;electrolyte interface triggers detrimental side reactions. Herein, this report in situ designs a multifunctional hybrid interphase of Bi/Bi2O3, for the first time resulting in a novel synergistic regulation mechanism involving: (i) chemically inert interface protection mechanism suppresses side reactions; and more fantastically, (ii) innovative thermodynamically favorable Zn atomic clusters dissociation mechanism impedes dendrites formation. Assisted by collaborative modulation behavior, the Zn@Bi/Bi2O3 symmetry cell delivers an ultrahigh cumulative plating capacity of 1.88 Ah cm&#8722;2 at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and ultralong lifetimes of 300&#160;h even at high current density and depth of discharge (10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, DODZn: 60%). Furthermore, under a low electrolyte&#8208;to&#8208;capacity ratio (E/C: 45&#160;&#181;L mAh&#8722;1) and negative&#8208;to&#8208;positive capacity ratio (N/P: 6.3), Zn@Bi/Bi2O3||MnO2 full&#8208;cell exhibits a superior capacity retention of 86.7% after 500 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1, which outperforms most existing interphases. The scaled&#8208;up Zn@Bi/Bi2O3||MnO2 battery module (6&#160;V, 1 Ah), combined with the photovoltaic panel, presents excellent renewable&#8208;energy storage ability and long output lifetime (12&#160;h). This work provides a fantastic synergistic mechanism to achieve the ultrastable Zn anode and can be greatly promised to apply it into other metal&#8208;based batteries.

     alt="Synergy of Dendrites-Impeded Atomic Clusters Dissociation and Side Reactions Suppressed Inert Interface Protection for Ultrastable Zn Anode"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A multifunctional composite interphase of Bi/Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is in situ designed on Zn anode, for the first time initiating a synergistic modulation mechanism: the innovative thermodynamically favorable Zn atomic clusters dissociation mechanism inhibiting dendrites formation and chemically inert interface protection mechanism alleviating interfacial side reactions. Eventually, Zn@Bi/Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; electrode exhibits remarkably prominent cyclic performance both in symmetry cells system and practical full cells system.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sluggish ions-transfer and inhomogeneous ions-nucleation induce the formation of randomly oriented dendrites on Zn anode, while the chemical instability at anode&#8211;electrolyte interface triggers detrimental side reactions. Herein, this report in situ designs a multifunctional hybrid interphase of Bi/Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, for the first time resulting in a novel synergistic regulation mechanism involving: (i) chemically inert interface protection mechanism suppresses side reactions; and more fantastically, (ii) innovative thermodynamically favorable Zn atomic clusters dissociation mechanism impedes dendrites formation. Assisted by collaborative modulation behavior, the Zn@Bi/Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry cell delivers an ultrahigh cumulative plating capacity of 1.88 Ah cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 5&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and ultralong lifetimes of 300&#160;h even at high current density and depth of discharge (10&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, DOD&lt;sub&gt;Zn&lt;/sub&gt;: 60%). Furthermore, under a low electrolyte-to-capacity ratio (E/C: 45&#160;&#181;L mAh&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and negative-to-positive capacity ratio (N/P: 6.3), Zn@Bi/Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;||MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; full-cell exhibits a superior capacity retention of 86.7% after 500 cycles at 1 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which outperforms most existing interphases. The scaled-up Zn@Bi/Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;||MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; battery module (6&#160;V, 1 Ah), combined with the photovoltaic panel, presents excellent renewable-energy storage ability and long output lifetime (12&#160;h). This work provides a fantastic synergistic mechanism to achieve the ultrastable Zn anode and can be greatly promised to apply it into other metal-based batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In Situ Rapid&#8208;Formation Sprayable Hydrogels for Challenging Tissue Injury Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly sought in medical scarcity situations, the hydrogel system offers rapid gelation and in situ spraying for treating extensive tissue injuries. Designed to address hemostasis, barrier establishment, and therapeutic treatment, the hydrogel forms in &lt;0.5 s, maintaining a balance between fluidity and mechanical strength. Its inherently bioactive includes osteogenesis, anti&#8208;inflammation, and angiogenesis, providing innovative solutions for challenging tissue injury management.








Abstract
Rapid&#8208;acting, convenient, and broadly applicable medical materials are in high demand for the treatment of extensive and intricate tissue injuries in extremely medical scarcity environment, such as battlefields, wilderness, and traffic accidents. Conventional biomaterials fail to meet all the high criteria simultaneously for emergency management. Here, a multifunctional hydrogel system capable of rapid gelation and in situ spraying, addressing clinical challenges related to hemostasis, barrier establishment, support, and subsequent therapeutic treatment of irregular, complex, and urgent injured tissues, is designed. This hydrogel can be fast formed in less than 0.5 s under ultraviolet initiation. The precursor maintains an impressively low viscosity of 0.018 Pa s, while the hydrogel demonstrates a storage modulus of 0.65&#160;MPa, achieving the delicate balance between sprayable fluidity and the mechanical strength requirements in practice, allowing flexible customization of the hydrogel system for differentiated handling and treatment of various tissues. Notably, the interactions between the component of this hydrogel and the cell surface protein confer upon its inherently bioactive functionalities such as osteogenesis, anti&#8208;inflammation, and angiogenesis. This research endeavors to provide new insights and designs into emergency management and complex tissue injuries treatment.

         <title>Self&#8208;Propulsion by Directed Explosive Emulsification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An alternative approach is introduced to create active droplets through a simple process of inducing symmetry&#8208;breaking oversaturation at the interface assembly. The partially oversaturated interfacial packing structure causes the asymmetrical explosive emulsification behavior and enables the directional movement of the droplet. The process exhibits autonomy, repeatability, and versatility in handling diverse nanoparticle compositions, making it highly promising for self&#8208;propulsion applications.








Abstract
An active droplet system, programmed to repeatedly move autonomously at a specific velocity in a well&#8208;defined direction, is demonstrated. Coulombic energy is stored in oversaturated interfacial assemblies of charged nanoparticle&#8208;surfactants by an applied DC electric field and can be released on demand. Spontaneous emulsification is suppressed by an increase in the stiffness of the oversaturated assemblies. Rapidly removing the field releases the stored energy in an explosive event that propels the droplet, where thousands of charged microdroplets are ballistically ejected from the surface of the parent droplet. The ejection is made directional by a symmetry breaking of the interfacial assembly, and the combined interaction force of the microdroplet plume on one side of the droplet propels the droplet distances tens of times its size, making the droplet active. The propulsion is autonomous, repeatable, and agnostic to the chemical composition of the nanoparticles. The symmetry&#8208;breaking in the nanoparticle assembly controls the microdroplet velocity and direction of propulsion. This mechanism of droplet propulsion will advance soft micro&#8208;robotics, establishes a new type of active matter, and introduces new vehicles for compartmentalized delivery.

         <title>Quantifying Dielectric Material Charge Trapping and De&#8208;Trapping Ability Via Ultra&#8208;Fast Charge Self&#8208;Injection Technique</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>

This work proposes an ultra&#8208;fast charge self&#8208;injection technique based on the air breakdown effect and introduces a general standard method to quantify traditional triboelectric materials' charge trapping and de&#8208;trapping effects.








Abstract
Recently, utilizing the air breakdown effect in the charge excitation strategy proves as an efficient charge injection technique to increase the surface charge density of dielectric polymers for triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). However, quantitative characterization of the ability of dielectric polymers to trap reverse charges and the effect on the startup time of secondary self&#8208;charge excitation (SSCE) are essential for extensive applications. Here, an ultra&#8208;fast charge self&#8208;injection technique based on a self&#8208;charge excitation strategy is proposed, and a standard method to quantify the charge trapping and de&#8208;trapping abilities of 23 traditional tribo&#8208;materials is introduced. Further, the relationship among the distribution of dielectric intrinsic deep, shallow trap states, and transportation of trapped charges is systematically analyzed in this article. It shows that the de&#8208;trapping rate of charges directly determines the reactivation and failure of SSCE. Last, independent of TENG contact efficiency, an ultra&#8208;high charge density of 2.67 mC m&#8722;2 and an ultra&#8208;fast startup time of SSCE are obtained using a 15&#160;&#181;m poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;trifluoroethylene) film, breaking the historical record for material modification. As a standard for material selection, this work quantifies the charge trapping and de&#8208;trapping ability of the triboelectric dielectric series and provides insights for understanding the charge transport in dielectrics.

         <title>Semimetallic Bismuthene with Edge&#8208;Rich Dangling Bonds: Broad&#8208;Spectrum&#8208;Driven and Edge&#8208;Confined Electron Enhancement Boosting CO2 Hydrogenation Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under broad&#8208;spectrum (UV&#8211;vis&#8211;NIR) excitation, photogenerated electrons in semimetallic bismuthene migrate from the partially electronically occupied intermediate band to the lowest fully unoccupied empty band. The edge dangling bonds of bismuthene as the active sites for CO2 adsorption/activation significantly reduce the catalytic reaction energy barrier and promote the formation of C&#9472;H bonds until the generation of CH4.








Broad&#8208;spectrum&#8208;driven high&#8208;performance artificial photosynthesis is quite challenging. Herein, atomically ultrathin bismuthene with semimetallic properties is designed and demonstrated for broad&#8208;spectrum (ultraviolet&#8208;visible&#8208;near infrared light) (UV&#8211;vis&#8211;NIR)&#8208;driven photocatalytic CO2 hydrogenation. The trap states in the bandgap produced by edge dangling bonds prolong the lifetime of the photogenerated electrons from 90&#160;ps in bulk Bi to 1650&#160;ps in bismuthine, and excited&#8208;state electrons are enriched at the edge of bismuthine. The edge dangling bonds of bismuthene as the active sites for adsorption/activation of CO2 increase the hybridization ability of the Bi 6p orbital and O 2p orbital to significantly reduce the catalytic reaction energy barrier and promote the formation of C&#9472;H bonds until the generation of CH4. Under &#955;&#160;&#8805;&#160;400&#160;nm and &#955;&#160;&#8805;&#160;550&#160;nm irradiation, the utilization ratios of photogenerated electron reduction CO2 hydrogenation to CO and CH4 for bismuthene are 58.24 and 300.50 times higher than those of bulk Bi, respectively. Moreover, bismuthene can extend the CO2 hydrogenation reaction to the near&#8208;infrared region (&#955;&#160;&#8805;&#160;700&#160;nm). This pioneering work employs the single semimetal element as an artificial photosynthetic catalyst to produce a broad spectral response.

Under &lt;i&gt;&#955;&lt;/i&gt;&#160;&#8805;&#160;400&#160;nm and &lt;i&gt;&#955;&lt;/i&gt;&#160;&#8805;&#160;550&#160;nm irradiation, the utilization ratios of photogenerated electron reduction CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogenation to CO and CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; for bismuthene are 58.24 and 300.50 times higher than those of bulk Bi, respectively. Moreover, bismuthene can extend the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogenation reaction to the near-infrared region (&lt;i&gt;&#955;&lt;/i&gt;&#160;&#8805;&#160;700&#160;nm). This pioneering work employs the single semimetal element as an artificial photosynthetic catalyst to produce a broad spectral response.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stabilizing Top Interface by Molecular Locking Strategy with Polydentate Chelating Biomaterials toward Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells in Ambient Air</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular locking strategy is proposed to stabilize top interface by adopting polydentate ligand green biomaterial 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;2,2&#8208;difluoro&#8208;d&#8208;erythro&#8208;pentafuranous&#8208;1&#8208;ulose&#8208;3,5&#8208;dibenzoate (DDPUD) to manipulate the surface and grain boundaries of perovskite films. The ingenious polydentate ligand chelating is translated into reduced interfacial defects, released interfacial stress, and enhanced moisture resistance. The DDPUD&#8208;modified device achieves an enhancement in power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 23.17% to 24.47%.








Abstract
The instability of top interface induced by interfacial defects and residual tensile strain hinders the realization of long&#8208;term stable n&#8211;i&#8211;p regular perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, one molecular locking strategy is reported to stabilize top interface by adopting polydentate ligand green biomaterial 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;2,2&#8208;difluoro&#8208;d&#8208;erythro&#8208;pentafuranous&#8208;1&#8208;ulose&#8208;3,5&#8208;dibenzoate (DDPUD) to manipulate the surface and grain boundaries of perovskite films. Both experimental and theoretical evidence collectively uncover that the uncoordinated Pb2+ ions, halide vacancy, and/or I&#9472;Pb antisite defects can be effectively healed and locked by firm chemical anchoring on the surface of perovskite films. The ingenious polydentate ligand chelating is translated into reduced interfacial defects, increased carrier lifetimes, released interfacial stress, and enhanced moisture resistance, which should be liable for strengthened top interface stability and inhibited interfacial nonradiative recombination. The universality of the molecular locking strategy is certified by employing different perovskite compositions. The DDPUD modification achieves an enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.17&#8211;24.47%, which is one of the highest PCEs ever reported for the devices prepared in ambient air. The unsealed DDPUD&#8208;modified devices maintain 98.18% and 88.10% of their initial PCEs after more than 3000&#160;h under a relative humidity of 10&#8211;20% and after 1728&#160;h at 65 &#176;C, respectively.

Gold Recovery
An artistic view of the recovery of gold from E&#8208;waste via a revisited version of The Kiss by Gustav Klimt. Dairy components (used for the adsorbing aerogel) are visible within the clothes of the man, while the woman's clothes are composed by gold ingots. The E&#8208;waste used for extracting gold lays as carpet, at the feet of the two lovers. More details can be found in article number 2310642 by Raffaele Mezzenga and co&#8208;workers.

Twisted Bilayer WS2
In article number 2313638, Xuetao Gan, Xuewen Wang, Wei Huang, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate an improved CVD setup for the direct synthesis of high&#8208;quality twisted bilayer WS2 with a wide twist angle range from 0 to 120&#176; by utilizing tilted SiO2/Si substrates. The strong correlation between the second harmonic generation (SHG) response and the twist angle suggests a tunable SHG performance with twist angles.

3D Printing
In article number 2311917 by Hyun&#8208;Jong Paik, Wonjoo Lee, Min Sang Kwon, Dowon Ahn, and co&#8208;workers, panchromatic photopolymer resins, selectively reacting to two colors of lights, are developed and applied to realize photoactive 3D printing. Longer&#8208;wavelength of light (red light, &#8776;620 nm) irradiation initiates rapid photopolymerization and 3D printing, resulting in remarkable build speed and feature resolution. Incorporating violet/blue&#8208;light&#8208;sensitive moieties (&#8776;405&#8211;450 nm), such as hexaarylbiimidazoles, enable independent spatiotemporal degradation/erasing.

Liver Fibrosis
In article number 2310443, Zhengwei Mao, Yuan Ding, Weilin Wang, and co&#8208;workers constructed cell membrane&#8208;camouflaged nanoparticles (HSCM@PLGA@Melatonin and PM@PLGA@Melatonin NPs) using platelet membranes and activated hepatic stellate cell membranes. The release of melatonin targeting the inflamed liver during homing improves endoplasmic reticulum stress and oxidative stress in the liver, significantly enhancing the therapeutic effect of liver fibrosis.

         <title>Multimodal Soft Robotic Actuation and Locomotion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Soft robots are a promising direction to create machines capable of complex motion observed in living creatures. Designing soft actuators that perform a combination of multiple actuation modalities allows them to perform intricate tasks. Then, applying multimodal actuators into soft robotics is conducive toward developing robots with multimodal gaits of locomotion that adapt to various environments for real&#8208;world applications.








Abstract
Diverse and adaptable modes of complex motion observed at different scales in living creatures are challenging to reproduce in robotic systems. Achieving dexterous movement in conventional robots can be difficult due to the many limitations of applying rigid materials. Robots based on soft materials are inherently deformable, compliant, adaptable, and adjustable, making soft robotics conducive to creating machines with complicated actuation and motion gaits. This review examines the mechanisms and modalities of actuation deformation in materials that respond to various stimuli. Then, strategies based on composite materials are considered to build toward actuators that combine multiple actuation modes for sophisticated movements. Examples across literature illustrate the development of soft actuators as free&#8208;moving, entirely soft&#8208;bodied robots with multiple locomotion gaits via careful manipulation of external stimuli. The review further highlights how the application of soft functional materials into robots with rigid components further enhances their locomotive abilities. Finally, taking advantage of the shape&#8208;morphing properties of soft materials, reconfigurable soft robots have shown the capacity for adaptive gaits that enable transition across environments with different locomotive modes for optimal efficiency. Overall, soft materials enable varied multimodal motion in actuators and robots, positioning soft robotics to make real&#8208;world applications for intricate and challenging tasks.

         <title>Sensing, Imaging, and Therapeutic Strategies Endowing by Conjugate Polymers for Precision Medicine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advanced conjugated polymers (CPs) are widely used in biomedical applications due to their excellent light absorption, high fluorescence quantum yield, and stability. This paper presents research advances in CPs for biological detection, imaging, therapeutics, and bio&#8208;electronic device fabrication. Through this review, it is hoped to provide cutting&#8208;edge information for basic research and clinical translation of CPs&#8208;based detection methods and technologies.








Abstract
Conjugated polymers (CPs) have promising applications in biomedical fields, such as disease monitoring, real&#8208;time imaging diagnosis, and disease treatment. As a promising luminescent material with tunable emission, high brightness and excellent stability, CPs are widely used as fluorescent probes in biological detection and imaging. Rational molecular design and structural optimization have broadened absorption/emission range of CPs, which are more conductive for disease diagnosis and precision therapy. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advances in the application of CPs, aiming to elucidate their structural and functional relationships. The fluorescence properties of CPs and the mechanism of detection signal amplification are first discussed, followed by an elucidation of their emerging applications in biological detection. Subsequently, CPs&#8208;based imaging systems and therapeutic strategies are illustrated systematically. Finally, recent advancements in utilizing CPs as electroactive materials for bioelectronic devices are also investigated. Moreover, the challenges and outlooks of CPs for precision medicine are discussed. Through this systematic review, it is hoped to highlight the frontier progress of CPs and promote new breakthroughs in fundamental research and clinical transformation.

         <title>Engineering and Targeting Neutrophils for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the recent advances in engineering neutrophils and their derivatives as drug delivery carriers for enhanced tumor targeting and improved therapeutic efficacy. Targeting neutrophils for remodeling tumor microenvironment (TME) and reinvigorating anti&#8208;tumor immunity provide a broad understanding of the potential application of neutrophils in cancer therapy.








Abstract
Neutrophils are the most abundant white blood cells in the circulation and act as the first line of defense against infections. Increasing evidence suggests that neutrophils possess heterogeneous phenotypes and functional plasticity in human health and diseases, including cancer. Neutrophils play multifaceted roles in cancer development and progression, and an N1/N2 paradigm of neutrophils in cancer is proposed, where N1 neutrophils exert anti&#8208;tumor properties while N2 neutrophils display tumor&#8208;supportive and immune&#8208;suppressive functions. Selective activation of beneficial neutrophil population and targeted inhibition or re&#8208;polarization of tumor&#8208;promoting neutrophils has shown an important potential in tumor therapy. In addition, due to the natural inflammation&#8208;responsive and physical barrier&#8208;crossing abilities, neutrophils and their derivatives (membranes and extracellular vesicles (EVs)) are regarded as advanced drug delivery carriers for enhanced tumor targeting and improved therapeutic efficacy. In this review, the recent advances in engineering neutrophils for drug delivery and targeting neutrophils for remodeling tumor microenvironment (TME) are comprehensively presented. This review will provide a broad understanding of the potential of neutrophils in cancer therapy.

         <title>Engineering Biomaterials to Model Immune&#8208;Tumor Interactions In Vitro</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>

In this review, the authors explore the pertinent microenvironmental cues that drive tumor progression in the context of the immune system, discuss how these cues can be incorporated into hydrogel design to culture immune cells, and describe progress toward precision oncological drug screening with engineered&#160;tissues.








Abstract
Engineered biomaterial scaffolds are becoming more prominent in research laboratories to study drug efficacy for oncological applications in vitro, but do they have a place in pharmaceutical drug screening pipelines? The low efficacy of cancer drugs in phase II/III clinical trials suggests that there are critical mechanisms not properly accounted for in the pre&#8208;clinical evaluation of drug candidates. Immune cells associated with the tumor may account for some of these failures given recent successes with cancer immunotherapies; however, there are few representative platforms to study immune cells in the context of cancer as traditional 2D culture is typically monocultures and humanized animal models have a weakened immune composition. Biomaterials that replicate tumor microenvironmental cues may provide a more relevant model with greater in vitro complexity. In this review, the authors explore the pertinent microenvironmental cues that drive tumor progression in the context of the immune system, discuss how these cues can be incorporated into hydrogel design to culture immune cells, and describe progress toward precision oncological drug screening with engineered tissues.

         <dc:description>
This review comprehensively highlights recent breakthroughs and critical milestones regarding the controllable synthesis processes, fluorescence origins, and cancer imaging or therapy applications of different families of nanocarbons: zero&#8208;dimensional carbon nanodots, nanodiamonds, carbon nanoonions, and two&#8208;dimensional carbon nanohorns.








Abstract
Nanocarbons are emerging at the forefront of nanoscience, with diverse carbon nanoforms emerging over the past two decades. Early cancer diagnosis and therapy, driven by advanced chemistry techniques, play a pivotal role in mitigating mortality rates associated with cancer. Nanocarbons, with an attractive combination of well&#8208;defined architectures, biocompatibility, and nanoscale dimension, offer an incredibly versatile platform for cancer imaging and therapy. This paper aims to review the underlying principles regarding the controllable synthesis, fluorescence origins, cellular toxicity, and surface functionalization routes of several classes of nanocarbons: carbon nanodots, nanodiamonds, carbon nanoonions, and carbon nanohorns. This review also highlights recent breakthroughs regarding the green synthesis of different nanocarbons from renewable sources. It also presents a comprehensive and unified overview of the latest cancer&#8208;related applications of nanocarbons and how they can be designed to interface with biological systems and work as cancer diagnostics and therapeutic tools. The commercial status for large&#8208;scale manufacturing of nanocarbons is also presented. Finally, it proposes future research opportunities aimed at engendering modifiable and high&#8208;performance nanocarbons for emerging applications across medical industries. This work is envisioned as a cornerstone to guide interdisciplinary teams in crafting fluorescent nanocarbons with tailored attributes that can revolutionize cancer diagnostics and therapy.

         <title>Improve the Charge Carrier Transporting in Two&#8208;Dimensional Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To improve the charge carrier transport in two&#8208;dimensional Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskite solar cells, this review shows the relevant progress from bandgap regulation, phase orientation and distribution, amine molecule selection, and energy level matching from the perspective of 2D perovskite structural properties. Finally, the possible future research directions and methods to achieve efficient and stable perovskite solar cells are rationalized.








Abstract
Conventional 3D organic&#8211;inorganic halide perovskite materials have shown substantial potential in the field of optoelectronics, enabling the power conversation efficiency of solar cells beyond 26%. A key challenge limiting the further commercial application of 3D perovskite solar cells is their inherent instability over outer oxygen, humidity, light, and heat. By contrast, 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (2DRP) perovskites with bulky organic cations can effectively stabilize the inorganic slabs, yielding excellent environmental stability. However, the efficiencies of 2DRP perovskite solar cells are much lower than those of the 3D counterparts due to poor charge carrier transporting property of insulating bulky organic cations. Their inner structural, dielectric, optical, and excitonic properties remain to be primarily studied. In this review, the main reasons for the low efficiency of 2DRP perovskite solar cells are first analyzed. Next, a detailed description of various strategies for improving the charge carrier transporting of 2DRP perovskites is provided, such as bandgap regulation, perovskite crystal phase orientation and distribution, energy level matching, interfacial modification, etc. Finally, a summary is given, and the possible future research directions and methods to achieve high&#8208;efficiency and stable 2DRP perovskite solar cells are rationalized.

By contrast, 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (2DRP) perovskites with bulky organic cations can effectively stabilize the inorganic slabs, yielding excellent environmental stability. However, the efficiencies of 2DRP perovskite solar cells are much lower than those of the 3D counterparts due to poor charge carrier transporting property of insulating bulky organic cations. Their inner structural, dielectric, optical, and excitonic properties remain to be primarily studied. In this review, the main reasons for the low efficiency of 2DRP perovskite solar cells are first analyzed. Next, a detailed description of various strategies for improving the charge carrier transporting of 2DRP perovskites is provided, such as bandgap regulation, perovskite crystal phase orientation and distribution, energy level matching, interfacial modification, etc. Finally, a summary is given, and the possible future research directions and methods to achieve high-efficiency and stable 2DRP perovskite solar cells are rationalized.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Topological Analysis and Structural Determination of 3D Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structure of covalent organic frameworks can be seen as periodic nets. First, some basic concepts about periodic nets and topology are introduced, and then the topological rules of reported 3D COFs are analyzed and summarized. Furthermore, the structural determination methods of 3D COFs is described, and finally, some prospects toward the structural problem of 3D COFs are proposed.








Abstract
3D covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs) constitute a new type of crystalline materials that consist of a range of porous structures with numerous applications in the fields of adsorption, separation, and catalysis. However, because of the complexity of the three&#8208;periodic net structure, it is desirable to develop a thorough structural comprehension, along with a means to precisely determine the actual structure. Indeed, such advancements would considerably contribute to the rational design and application of 3D COFs. In this review, the reported topologies of 3D COFs are introduced and categorized according to the configurations of their building blocks, and a comprehensive overview of diffraction&#8208;based structural determination methods is provided. The current challenges and future prospects for these materials will also be discussed.

         <title>Eliminating Non&#8208;Corner&#8208;Sharing Octahedral for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
The metal halide octahedron is regarded as the fundamental structural and functional unit of perovskites. However, the impact of octahedral connectivity in perovskites on device performance is not systematically explored. This manuscript provides direct experimental evidence that the existence of non&#8208;corner&#8208;sharing regions is detrimental to device performance and provides key guidance on how to regulate octahedral connectivity.








Abstract
The metal halide (BX6)4&#8208; octahedron, where B represents a metal cation and X represents a halide anion, is regarded as the fundamental structural and functional unit of metal halide perovskites. However, the influence of the way the (BX6)4&#8722; octahedra connect to each other has on the structural stability and optoelectronic properties of metal halide perovskite is still unclear. Here, the octahedral connectivity, including corner&#8208;, edge&#8208;, and face&#8208;sharing, of various CsxFA1&#8208;xPbI3 (0&#160;&#8804;&#160;x&#160;&#8804;&#160;0.3) perovskite films is tuned and reliably characterized through compositional and additive engineering, and with ultralow&#8208;dose transmission electron microscopy. It is found that the overall solar cell device performance, the charge carrier lifetime, the open&#8208;circuit voltage, and the current density&#8211;voltage hysteresis are all improved when the films consist of corner&#8208;sharing octahedra, and non&#8208;corner sharing phases are suppressed, even in films with the same chemical composition. Additionally, it is found that the structural, optoelectronic, and device performance stabilities are similarly enhanced when non&#8208;corner&#8208;sharing connectivities are suppressed. This approach, combining macroscopic device tests and microscopic material characterization, provides a powerful tool enabling a thorough understanding of the impact of octahedral connectivity on device performance, and opens a new parameter space for designing high&#8208;performance photovoltaic metal halide perovskite devices.

Abstract
Metal oxide nanostructures have received an increasing attention owing to their unique chemical and physical properties along with their widespread applications in various fields. In this article, we provide an overview of our recent discovery &#8211; christened Hydroxides&#8208;Derived Nanostructures, or HDNs &#8211; in which we react hydroxide aqueous solutions (mostly tetramethylammonium hydroxide, TMAH) at temperatures &lt; 100&#160;&#176;C and under atmospheric pressure with various metal&#8208;containing precursors to scalably prepare novel metal oxide nanostructures. In one case, we converted a dozen commercial and earth abundant Ti&#8208;containing powders such as binary carbides, nitrides, borides, among others, into new, one&#8208;dimensional TiO2&#8211;based lepidocrocite (1DL) nanofilaments (NFs). Application&#8208;wise, 1DLs show outstanding performance in a number of energy, environmental, and biomedical fields such as photo&#8208; and electrocatalysis, water splitting, lithium&#8208;sulfur and lithium&#8208;ion batteries, water purification, dye degradation, cancer therapy, and polymer composites. In addition to 1DL, the HDNs family encompasses other metal oxides nanostructures including magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles and MnO2 birnessite&#8208;based crystalline two&#8208;dimensional (2D) flakes. The latter showed promise as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for water oxidation and oxygen reduction, as well as cathodes in aqueous asymmetric supercapacitor and in an aqueous ammonium ion battery. Our developed recipe provides a new vista in the molecular self&#8208;assembly synthesis of metal oxide nanomaterials that can advance the field with a library of novel nanostructures with substantial implications in a multitude of fields.

         <title>Addressing the Carbonate Issue: Electrocatalysts for Acidic CO2 Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) powered by renewable energy provides a promising route to CO2 conversion and utilization. However, the widely used neutral/alkaline electrolyte consumes a large amount of CO2 to produce (bi)carbonate byproducts, leading to significant challenges at the device level, thereby impeding the further deployment of this reaction. Conducting CO2RR in acidic electrolytes offers a promising solution to address the &#8220;carbonate issue&#8221;; however, it presents inherent difficulties due to the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction, necessitating concerted efforts towards advanced catalyst and electrode designs to achieve high selectivity and activity. This review encompasses recent developments of acidic CO2RR, from mechanism elucidation to catalyst design and device engineering. We begin by discussing the mechanistic understanding of the reaction pathway, laying the foundation for catalyst design in acidic CO2RR. Subsequently, we provide an in&#8208;depth analysis of recent advancements in acidic CO2RR catalysts, highlighting heterogeneous catalysts, surface immobilized molecular catalysts and catalyst surface enhancement. Furthermore, we summarize the progress made in device&#8208;level applications, aiming to develop high&#8208;performance acidic CO2RR systems. Finally, we outline the existing challenges and future directions in the design of acidic CO2RR catalysts, emphasizing the need for improved selectivity, activity, stability, and scalability.

         <title>Combating Atherosclerosis with Chirality/Phase Dual&#8208;Engineered Nanozyme Featuring Microenvironment&#8208;Programmed Senolytic and Senomorphic Actions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Senescence plays a critical role in the development and progression of various diseases. This study introduces an amorphous, high&#8208;entropy alloy nanozyme&#8208;based therapeutic designed to combat senescence. We start by screening ligands to optimize the synthesis of the amorphous nanozyme. By adjusting the nanozyme's composition and surface properties, we analyze its catalytic performance under both normal and aging conditions, confirming that peroxide and superoxide dismutase activity are crucial for its anti&#8208;aging therapeutic function. Subsequently, we validate the chiral&#8208;dependent therapeutic effects and demonstrate the senolytic performance of D&#8208;handed PtPd2CuFe across several aging models. Through proteomic and transcriptome analyses, we explore the mechanism underlying the senolytic action exerted by nanozyme in depth. We confirm that exposure to senescent conditions led to the enrichment of copper and iron atoms in the nanozyme's lower oxidation states, disrupting the iron&#8208;thiol cluster in mitochondria and lipoic acid transferase, as well as oxidizing unsaturated fatty acids. These actions triggered a cascade of cuproptotic and ferroptotic cell death. Additionally, we found that the nanozyme's anti&#8208;aging effects depend on concentration. Even an ultra&#8208;low dose of the therapeutic can act as a senomorphic, reducing the effects of senescence. Given its broad&#8208;spectrum action and concentration&#8208;adjustable anti&#8208;aging potential, we confirmed the remarkable therapeutic capability of D&#8208;handed PtPd2CuFe in managing atherosclerosis, a disease involving various types of senescent cells.

Even an ultra-low dose of the therapeutic can act as a senomorphic, reducing the effects of senescence. Given its broad-spectrum action and concentration-adjustable anti-aging potential, we confirmed the remarkable therapeutic capability of D-handed PtPd2CuFe in managing atherosclerosis, a disease involving various types of senescent cells.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Stable Oxyhalide&#8208;Nitride Fast Ionic Conductors for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Li Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work provides a group of oxyhalide&#8208;nitride solid&#8208;state electrolytes (ONSEs) that possess high ionic conductivity of 0.52 mS cm&#8722;1 accompanied with low activation energy of 0.35 eV. The ONSEs are capable of achieving long&#8208;term cycling of Li||Li symmetric cell, as well as providing a high critical current density of &gt;7.4 mA cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Rechargeable all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (ASSLMBs) utilizing inorganic solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) are promising for electric vehicles and large&#8208;scale grid energy storage. However, the Li dendrite growth in SSEs still constrains the practical utility of ASSLMBs. To achieve a high dendrite&#8208;suppression capability, SSEs must be chemically stable with Li, possess fast Li transfer kinetics, and exhibit high interface energy. Herein, a class of low&#8208;cost, eco&#8208;friendly, and sustainable oxyhalide&#8208;nitride solid electrolytes (ONSEs), denoted as LixNyIz&#8208;qLiOH (where x = 3y + z, 0 &#8804; q &#8804; 0.75), is designed to fulfill all the requirements. As&#8208;prepared ONSEs demonstrate chemically stable against Li and high interface energy (&gt;43.08 meV &#197;&#8722;2), effectively restraining Li dendrite growth and the self&#8208;degradation at electrode interfaces. Furthermore, improved thermodynamic oxidation stability of ONSEs (&gt;3&#160;V vs Li+/Li, 0.45&#160;V for pure Li3N), arising from the increased ionicity of Li&#9472;N bonds, contributes to the stability in ASSLMBs. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the optimized ONSEs possess high ionic conductivity of 0.52 mS cm&#8722;1 and achieve long&#8208;term cycling of Li||Li symmetric cell for over 500&#160;h. When coupled with the Li3InCl6 SSE for high&#8208;voltage cathodes, the bilayer oxyhalide&#8208;nitride/Li3InCl6 electrolyte imparts 90% capacity retention over 500 cycles for Li||1 mAh cm&#8722;2 LiCoO2 cells.

         <title>Constructing High&#8208;Active Surface of Plasmonic Tungsten Oxide for Photocatalytic Alcohol Dehydration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high&#8208;active surface of plasmonic tungsten oxide is tuned by simultaneously increasing the body crystallinity and surface oxygen vacancies to overcome the hindrance of the surface depletion layer in photocatalytic alcohol dehydration. The activation barrier for TBA dehydration is significantly reduced by 93% to 6.0&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1, and highly selective isobutylene generation reaches 1.8&#160;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1.








Abstract
Plasmonic semiconductors with broad spectral response hold significant promise for sustainable solar energy utilization. However, the surface inertness limits the photocatalytic activity. Herein, a novel approach is proposed to improve the body crystallinity and increase the surface oxygen vacancies of plasmonic tungsten oxide by the combination of hydrochloric acid (HCl) regulation and light irradiation, which can promote the adsorption of tert&#8208;butyl alcohol (TBA) on plasmonic tungsten oxide and overcome the hindrance of the surface depletion layer in photocatalytic alcohol dehydration. Additionally, this process can concentrate electrons for strong plasmonic electron oscillation on the near surface, facilitating rapid electron transfer within the adsorbed TBA molecules for C&#8208;O bond cleavage. As a result, the activation barrier for TBA dehydration is significantly reduced by 93% to 6.0&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1, much lower than that of thermocatalysis (91&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1). Therefore, an optimal isobutylene generation rate of 1.8&#160;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 (selectivity of 99.9%) is achieved. A small flow reaction system is further constructed, which shows an isobutylene generation rate of 12&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 under natural sunlight irradiation. This work highlights the potential of plasmonic semiconductors for efficient photocatalytic alcohol dehydration, thereby promoting the sustainable utilization of solar energy.

         <title>Anomalous&#8208;Chern Steering of Topological Nonreciprocal Guided Waves</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a novel method for one&#8208;way, reconfigurable guiding of microwave photons along predefined paths on a 2D metamaterial platform, with unprecedented flexibility and reconfiguration speed. The new approach is based on topological effects inherent to unitary systems, and relies on doping a circulator scattering network with a tunable scatterers. This breakthrough paves way toward practical realization of reconfigurable topological meta&#8208;devices for robust communication technologies.








Abstract
Nonreciprocal topological edge states based on external magnetic bias have been regarded as the last resort for genuine unidirectional wave transport, showing superior robustness over topological states with preserved time&#8208;reversal symmetry. However, fast and efficient reconfigurability of their trajectory has remained a formidable challenge due to the difficulty in controlling the spatial distribution of magnetic fields over large areas and short times. Here, this&#160;persistent issue is solved by leveraging the rich topology of unitary scattering networks, and achieve fast steering of nonreciprocal topological transport at an interface between a Chern and an anomalous topological insulator, without having to control a magnetic field. Such interface can be drawn by doping the network with scatterers located at the center of each link, whose level of reflection is electrically tuned. With experiments in the GHz range, the possibility to actively steer the way of unidirectional edge states is demonstrated, switching the transmission path thousands of times per second in a fully&#8208;robust topological heterostructure. The approach represents a significant step towards the realization of practical reconfigurable topological meta&#8208;devices with broken time&#8208;reversal symmetry, and their application to future robust communication&#160;technologies.

         <title>Metallic Ru&#9472;Ru Interaction in Ruthenium Oxide Enabling Durable Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique RuO2 catalyst containing metallic Ru&#9472;Ru interactions (m&#8208;RuO2) is developed, which demonstrates great stability in proton exchange membrane water electrolysis. The under&#8208;coordinate Ru species are stabilized and the energy barrier for Ru dissolution is increased due to the presence of Ru&#9472;Ru interactions. These results highlight the significance of local coordination structure modulation in developing robust electrocatalysts.








Abstract
Developing efficient and robust electrocatalysts toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is critical for proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE). RuO2 possesses intrinsically high OER activity, but the concurrent electrochemical dissolution leads to rapid deactivation. Here a unique RuO2 catalyst containing metallic Ru&#9472;Ru interactions (m&#8208;RuO2) is reported, which maintains stability in practical PEMWE for 100&#160;h at 60 &#176;C and 1 A cm&#8722;2. Experimental and theoretical investigations suggest that the presence of Ru&#9472;Ru interactions significantly increases the energy barrier for the formation of RuO2(OH)2, which is a key intermediate for Ru dissolution, and hence substantially mitigates the electrochemical corrosion of m&#8208;RuO2. Meanwhile, the Ru4d band center downshifts, accordingly, ensuring the high OER activity, and the participation of lattice oxygen in the OER is also suppressed at the Ru&#9472;Ru sites, further contributing to the enhanced durability. Interestingly, such enhanced stability is also dependent on the size of metallic Ru&#9472;Ru cluster, where the energy barrier is further increased for Ru3, but is decreased for Ru5. These results highlight the significance of local coordination structure modulation on the electrochemical stability of RuO2 and open a feasible avenue toward the development of robust OER electrocatalysts for high&#8208;performance PEMWE.

         <title>Manipulating Radiation&#8208;Sensitive Z&#8208;DNA Conformation for Enhanced Radiotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The inherent radiosensitivity of tumor DNA represents a breakthrough in sensitization, yet enhancing it remains a challenge. Based on the positive impact of Z&#8208;DNA conformation on its inherent radiosensitivity, a novel radiosensitization strategy is proposed, aiming to enhance radiation&#8208;induced DNA double&#8208;strand breaks (DSBs) by facilitating the B&#8208;Z DNA conformation transition mediated by CBL@HfO2 nanocapsules.









Abstract
DNA double&#8208;strand breaks (DSBs) yield highly determines radiotherapy efficacy. However, improving the inherent radiosensitivity of tumor DNA to promote radiation&#8208;induced DSBs remains a challenge. Using theoretical and experimental models, the underexplored impact of Z&#8208;DNA conformations on radiosensitivity, yielding higher DSBs than other DNA conformations, is discovered. Thereout, a radiosensitization strategy focused on inducing Z&#8208;DNA conformation, utilizing CBL@HfO2 nanocapsules loaded with a Z&#8208;DNA inducer CBL0137, is proposed. A hollow mesoporous HfO2 (HM&#8208;HfO2) acts as a delivery and an energy depositor to promote Z&#8208;DNA breakage. The nanocapsule permits the smart DSBs accelerator that triggers its radiosensitization with irradiation stimulation. Impressively, the CBL@HfO2 facilitates the B&#8208;Z DNA conformational transition, augmenting DSBs about threefold stronger than irradiation alone, generating significant tumor suppression with a 30% cure rate. The approach enables DSBs augmentation by improving the inherent radiosensitivity of DNA. As such, it opens up an era of Z&#8208;DNA conformation manipulation in radiotherapy.

         <title>Extraordinary Thermoelectric Properties of Topological Surface States in Quantum&#8208;Confined Cd3As2 Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermoelectric properties of topological Dirac semimetal Cd3As2 thin films with varying thicknesses are systematically studied. Significant enhancement of the Seebeck coefficient in quantum&#8208;confined thin films at cryogenic temperatures is observed, which is attributed to the contribution of topological surface states. The findings suggest promising applications of topological thermoelectric materials in cryogenic solid&#8208;state cooling.








Abstract
Topological insulators and semimetals have been shown to possess intriguing thermoelectric properties promising for energy harvesting and cooling applications. However, thermoelectric transport associated with the Fermi arc topological surface states on topological Dirac semimetals remains less explored. This work systematically examines thermoelectric transport in a series of topological Dirac semimetal Cd3As2 thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. Surprisingly, significantly enhanced Seebeck effect and anomalous Nernst effect are found at cryogenic temperatures when the Cd3As2 layer is thin. In particular, a peak Seebeck coefficient of nearly 500&#160;&#181;V&#160;K&#8722;1 and a corresponding thermoelectric power factor over 30&#160;mW&#160;K&#8722;2&#160;m&#8722;1 are observed at 5&#160;K in a 25&#8208;nm&#8208;thick sample. Combining angle&#8208;dependent quantum oscillation analysis, magnetothermoelectric measurement, transport modeling, and first&#8208;principles simulation, the contributions from bulk and surface conducting channels are isolated and the unusual thermoelectric properties are attributed to the topological surface states. The analysis showcases the rich thermoelectric transport physics in quantum&#8208;confined topological Dirac semimetal thin films and suggests new routes to achieving high thermoelectric performance at cryogenic&#160;temperatures.

         <title>Eight In. Wafer&#8208;Scale Epitaxial Monolayer MoS2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper presents the epitaxial growth of 8&#8208;in. wafer&#8208;scale highly oriented monolayer MoS2 on sapphire with excellent spatial homogeneity, using a specially designed vertical chemical vapor deposition system. The as&#8208;grown 8&#8208;in. MoS2 wafers are used for the batch fabrication of large&#8208;scale, high&#8208;performance devices, including field&#8208;effect transistors, logic circuits, and ring oscillators, showcasing the potential for practical industry&#8208;scale applications.








Abstract
Large&#8208;scale, high&#8208;quality, and uniform monolayer molybdenum disulfide&#160;(MoS2) films are crucial for their applications in next&#8208;generation electronics and optoelectronics. Epitaxy is a mainstream technique for achieving high&#8208;quality MoS2 films and is demonstrated at a wafer scale up to 4&#8208;in. In this study, the epitaxial growth of 8&#8208;in. wafer&#8208;scale highly oriented monolayer MoS2 on sapphire is reported as with excellent spatial homogeneity, using a specially designed vertical chemical vapor deposition (VCVD) system. Field effect transistors (FETs) based on the as&#8208;grown 8&#8208;in. wafer&#8208;scale monolayer MoS2 film are fabricated and exhibit high performances, with an average mobility and an on/off ratio of 53.5 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and 107, respectively. In addition, batch fabrication of logic devices and 11&#8208;stage ring oscillators are also demonstrated, showcasing excellent electrical functions. This work may pave the way of MoS2 in practical industry&#8208;scale applications.

         <title>Stabilizing the Bulk&#8208;Phase and Solid Electrolyte Interphase of Silicon Microparticle Anode by Constructing Gradient&#8208;Hierarchically Ordered Conductive Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a gradient&#8208;hierarchically ordered conductive (GHOC) network is designed to enhance the stability of both the bulk&#8208;phase and interphase of &#181;Si. Within the GHOC network, Ti3C2T acts as conductive &#8220;brick&#8221;, establishing highly conductive inner layer, while the porous outer layer, composed of TCNF and PAA, functions akin to structural &#8220;rebar&#8221; and &#8220;concrete&#8221;, ensuring the tightly interconnected conductive framework.








Abstract
The poor bulk&#8208;phase and interphase stability, attributable to adverse internal stress, impede the cycling performance of silicon microparticles (&#181;Si) anodes and the commercial application for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries. In this work, a groundbreaking gradient&#8208;hierarchically ordered conductive (GHOC) network structure, ingeniously engineered to enhance the stability of both bulk&#8208;phase and the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) configurations of &#181;Si, is proposed. Within the GHOC network architecture, two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition metal carbides (Ti3C2Tx) act as a conductive &#8220;brick&#8221;, establishing a highly conductive inner layer on &#181;Si, while the porous outer layer, composed of one&#8208;dimensional (1D) Tempo&#8208;oxidized cellulose nanofibers (TCNF) and polyacrylic acid (PAA) macromolecule, functions akin to structural &#8220;rebar&#8221; and &#8220;concrete&#8221;, effectively preserves the tightly interconnected conductive framework through multiple bonding mechanisms, including covalent and hydrogen bonds. Additionally, Ti3C2Tx enhances the development of a LiF&#8208;enriched SEI. Consequently, the &#181;Si&#8208;MTCNF&#8208;PAA anode presents a high discharge capacity of 1413.7 mAh g&#8722;1 even after 500 cycles at 1.0 C. Moreover, a full cell, integrating LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 with &#181;Si&#8208;MTCNF&#8208;PAA, exhibits a capacity retention rate of 92.0% following 50 cycles. This GHOC network structure can offer an efficacious pathway for stabilizing both the bulk&#8208;phase and interphase structure of anode materials with high volumetric strain.

Abstract
Membrane&#8208;based enantioselective separation is a promising method for chiral resolution due to its low cost and high efficiency. However, scalable fabrication of chiral separation membranes displaying both high enantioselectivity and high flux of enantiomers is still a challenge. Here, we report the preparation of homochiral porous organic cage (CC3&#8208;R)&#8208;based enantioselective thin&#8208;film&#8208;composite membranes using polyamide (PA) as the matrix, where fully organic and solvent&#8208;processable cage crystals have good compatibility with the polymer scaffold. The hierarchical CC3&#8208;R channels consist of chiral selective windows and inner cavities, leading to favorable chiral resolution and permeation of enantiomers; the CC3&#8208;R/PA composite membranes display an enantiomeric excess (ee) of 95.2% for R&#8208;(+)&#8208;limonene over S&#8208;(&#8208;)&#8208;limonene and a high flux of 99.9&#160;mg h&#8722;1 m&#8722;2. This work sheds light on the use of homochiral porous organic cages for preparing enantioselective membranes and demonstrates a new route for the development of next&#8208;generation chiral separation membranes.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction on Metallic CoNi&#8208;Terminated Catalyst with Industrial&#8208;Level Current Density in Neutral Medium</title>

Abstract
Green ammonia synthesis through electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (eNO3RR) can serve as an effective alternative to the traditional energy&#8208;intensive Haber&#8208;Bosch process. However, achieving high Faradaic efficiency (FE) at industrially relevant current density in neutral medium poses significant challenges in eNO3RR. Herein, with the guidance of theoretical calculation, we successfully designed and constructed a metallic CoNi&#8208;terminated catalyst on copper foam, which achieves an ammonia FE of up to 100% under industrial&#8208;level current density and very low overpotential (&#8208;0.15&#160;V versus RHE) in a neutral medium. Multiple characterization results have confirmed that the maintained metal atom&#8208;terminated surface through interaction with copper atoms plays a crucial role in reducing overpotential and achieving high current density. By constructing a home&#8208;made gas stripping and absorption device, we demonstrated the complete conversion process for high&#8208;purity ammonium nitrate products, displaying the potential for practical application. Our work suggests a sustainable and promising process towards directly converting nitrate&#8208;containing pollutant solutions into practical nitrogen fertilizers.

Multiple characterization results have confirmed that the maintained metal atom-terminated surface through interaction with copper atoms plays a crucial role in reducing overpotential and achieving high current density.

         <title>Constructing Ru&#8208;O&#8208;TM Bridge in NiFe&#8208;LDH Enables High Current Hydrazine&#8208;assisted H2 Production</title>

Abstract
Hydrazine oxidation&#8208;assisted water splitting is a critical technology to tackle the high energy consumption in large&#8208;scale H2 production. Ru&#8208;based electrocatalysts hold promise for synergetic hydrogen reduction (HER) and hydrazine oxidation (HzOR) catalysis but are hindered by excessive superficial adsorption of reactant intermediate. Herein, we design Ru cluster anchoring on NiFe&#8208;LDH (denoted as Ruc/NiFe&#8208;LDH), which effectively enhances the intermediate adsorption capacity of Ru by constructing Ru&#8208;O&#8208;Ni/Fe bridges. Notably, it achieves an industrial current density of 1 A cm&#8722;2 at an unprecedentedly low voltage of 0.43&#160;V, saving 3.94&#160;kWh m&#8722;3H2 in energy, and exhibits remarkable stability over 120 hours at a high current density of 5 A cm&#8722;2. Advanced characterizations and theoretical calculation reveal that the presence of Ru&#8208;O&#8208;Ni/Fe bridges widens the d&#8208;band width of the Ru cluster, leading to lower d&#8208;band center and higher electron occupation on antibonding orbitals, thereby facilitating moderate adsorption energy and enhanced catalytic activity of Ru.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Crystalline Core&#8208;Shell Guanine Spherulites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Spherical particles with diameters within the wavelength of visible light, known as spherulites, manipulate light uniquely due to their spatial organization and their structural birefringence. Most of the known crystalline spherulites are branched, and composed of metals, alloys, and semi&#8208;crystalline polymers. Recently, a different spherulite architecture was&#160;discovered in the vision systems of decapod crustaceans &#8208; core&#8208;shell spherulites composed of highly birefringent (&#916;n &#8764; 30%) organic single&#8208;crystal platelets, with exceptional optical properties. These metastructures, which efficiently scatter light even in dense aqueous environments, have no synthetic equivalence and serve as a natural proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept as well as synthetic inspiration for thin scattering media. Here, we&#160;present the synthesis of core&#8208;shell spherulites composed of guanine crystal platelets (&#916;n &#8764; 25%) in a two&#8208;step emulsification process in which we&#160;use a water/oil/water emulsion and induced pH changes to promote interfacial crystallization. Carboxylic acids neutralize the dissolved guanine salts to form spherulites composed of single, radially stacked, &#946;&#8208;guanine platelets, which are oriented tangentially to the spherulite surface. Using Mie theory calculations and forward scattering measurements from single spherulites, we&#160;find that due to the single&#8208;crystal properties and orientation, the synthetic spherulites possess a high tangential refractive index, similarly to biogenic&#160;particles.

         <title>Electrically Reconfigurable Phase&#8208;Change Transmissive Metasurface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Programmable and reconfigurable optics hold significant potential for transforming a broad spectrum of applications, spanning space explorations to biomedical imaging, gas sensing, and optical cloaking. The ability to adjust the optical properties of components like filters, lenses, and beam steering devices could result in dramatic reductions in size, weight, and power consumption in future optoelectronic devices. Among the potential candidates for reconfigurable optics, chalcogenide&#8208;based phase change materials (PCMs) offer great promise due to their non&#8208;volatile and analogue switching characteristics. Although PCM have found widespread use in electronic data storage, these memory devices are deeply sub&#8208;micron&#8208;sized. To incorporate phase change materials into free&#8208;space optical components, it is essential to scale them up to beyond several hundreds of microns while maintaining reliable switching characteristics. This study demonstrated a non&#8208;mechanical, non&#8208;volatile transmissive filter based on low&#8208;loss PCMs with a 200 &#181;m&#215;200 &#181;m switching area. The device/metafilter can be consistently switched between low&#8208; and high&#8208;transmission states using electrical pulses with a switching contrast ratio of 5.5 dB. The device was&#160;reversibly switched for 1250 cycles before accelerated degradation took place. The work represents an important step toward realizing free&#8208;space reconfigurable optics based on&#160;PCMs.

         <title>Rapid Surface Reconstruction of In2S3 Photoanode via Flame Treatment for Enhanced Photoelectrochemical Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Surface reconstruction, re&#8208;organizing the surface atoms or structure, is a promising strategy to manipulate materials' electrical, electrochemical, and surface catalytic properties. Herein, we demonstrate a rapid surface reconstruction of indium sulfide (In2S3) via a high&#8208;temperature flame treatment to improve its charge collection properties. The flame process selectively transforms the In2S3 surface into a diffusionless In2O3 layer with high crystallinity. Additionally, it controllably generates bulk sulfur (S) vacancies within a few seconds, leading to surface&#8208;reconstructed In2S3 (sr&#8208;In2S3). When using those sr&#8208;In2S3 as photoanode for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting devices, these dual functions of surface In2O3/bulk In2S3 reduce the charge recombination in the surface and bulk region, thus improving photocurrent density and stability. With optimized surface reconstruction, the sr&#8208;In2S3 photoanode demonstrates a significant photocurrent density of 8.5&#160;mA/cm2 at 1.23&#160;V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), marking a 2.5&#8208;fold increase compared to pristine In2S3 (3.5&#160;mA/cm2). More importantly, the sr&#8208;In2S3 photoanode exhibited an impressive photocurrent density of 7.3&#160;mA/cm2 at 0.6&#160;V versus RHE for iodide oxidation reaction (IOR). We also showcase a practical and scalable surface reconstruction via flame treatment. Our work provides new insights for surface reconstruction engineering in sulfide&#8208;based semiconductors, making a breakthrough in developing efficient solar&#8208;fuel energy devices.

When using those sr-In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as photoanode for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting devices, these dual functions of surface In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/bulk In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; reduce the charge recombination in the surface and bulk region, thus improving photocurrent density and stability. With optimized surface reconstruction, the sr-In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; photoanode demonstrates a significant photocurrent density of 8.5&#160;mA/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 1.23&#160;V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), marking a 2.5-fold increase compared to pristine In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (3.5&#160;mA/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). More importantly, the sr-In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; photoanode exhibited an impressive photocurrent density of 7.3&#160;mA/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.6&#160;V versus RHE for iodide oxidation reaction (IOR). We also showcase a practical and scalable surface reconstruction via flame treatment. Our work provides new insights for surface reconstruction engineering in sulfide-based semiconductors, making a breakthrough in developing efficient solar-fuel energy devices.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Customized Proteinaceous Nanoformulation for In Vivo Chemical Reprogramming</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Sweat gland (SwG) regeneration is crucial for the functional rehabilitation of burn patients. In vivo chemical reprogramming that harnessing the patient's own cells in damaged tissue is of substantial interest to regenerate organs endogenously by pharmacological manipulation, which could compensate for tissue loss in devastating diseases and injuries, e.g., burns. However, achieving in vivo chemical reprogramming is challenging due to the low reprogramming efficiency and an unfavorable tissue environment. Herein, we have developed a functionalized proteinaceous nanoformulation delivery system containing prefabricated epidermal growth factor (EGF) structure for on&#8208;demand delivery of a cocktail of seven SwG reprogramming components to the dermal site. Such a chemical reprogramming system can efficiently induce the conversion of epidermal keratinocytes into SwG myoepithelial cells, resulting in successful in situ regeneration of functional SwGs. Notably, in vivo chemical reprogramming of SwGs is achieved for the first time with an impressive efficiency of 30.6%, surpassing previously reported efficiencies. Overall, our proteinaceous nanoformulation provides a platform for coordinating the target delivery of multiple pharmacological agents and facilitating in vivo SwG reprogramming by chemicals. This advancement greatly improves the clinical accessibility of in vivo reprogramming and offers a non&#8208;surgical, non&#8208;viral, and cell&#8208;free strategy for in situ SwG regeneration.

         <title>Superhydrophobic Solar&#8208;to&#8208;Thermal Materials toward Cutting&#8208;Edge Applications</title>

Abstract
Solar&#8208;to&#8208;thermal conversion is a direct and effective way to absorb sunlight for heat via the rational design and control of photothermal materials. However, when exposed to water&#8208;existed conditions, the conventional solar&#8208;to&#8208;thermal performance may experience severe degradation owing to the high specific heat capacity of water. To tackle with the challenge, the water&#8208;repellent function is introduced to construct superhydrophobic solar&#8208;to&#8208;thermal materials (SSTMs) for achieving stable heating and even creating new application possibilities under water droplets, sweat, seawater and ice environments. In this review, we give in&#8208;depth review of cutting&#8208;edge researches of SSTMs, focusing on synergetic functions, typical construction methods, and cutting&#8208;edge potentials based on water medium. Moreover, the current challenges and future prospects based on SSTMs are also carefully discussed.

         <title>Inorganic Composition Modulation of Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Fast Charging Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) with lithium fluoride (LiF) is critical to the performance of lithium metal batteries (LMBs) due to its high stability and mechanical properties. However, the low Li ion conductivity of LiF impedes the rapid diffusion of Li ions in the SEI, which leads to localized Li ion oversaturation dendritic deposition and hinders the practical applications of LMBs at high&#8208;current regions (&gt;3 C). To address this issue, we introduce a fluorophosphated SEI rich with fast ion&#8208;diffusing inorganic grain boundaries (LiF/Li3P). By utilizing a sol electrolyte that contains highly dispersed porous LiF nanoparticles modified with phosphorus&#8208;containing functional groups, we construct a fluorophosphated SEI and demonstrate the presence of electrochemically&#8208;active Li within these fast ion&#8208;diffusing grain boundaries (GBs&#8208;Li) that are non&#8208;nucleated, ensuring the stability of the Li || NCM811 cell for over 1,000 cycles at fast&#8208;charging rates of 5 C (11&#160;mA cm&#8722;2). Additionally, we fabricate a practical, long cycling, and intrinsically safe LMB pouch cell with high energy density (400&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1). Our work reveals how SEI components and structure design can enable fast&#8208;charging LMBs.

         <title>Recent Advances in Ferroelectret Fabrication, Performance Optimization and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The growing demand for wearable devices has sparked a significant interest in ferroelectret films. They possess flexibility and exceptional piezoelectric properties due to strong macroscopic&#8208;dipoles formed by charges trapped at the interface of their internal cavities. This review of ferroelectrets focuses on the latest progress in fabrication techniques for high temperature resistant ferroelectrets with regular and engineered cavities, strategies for optimizing their piezoelectric performance, and novel applications. The charging mechanisms of bipolar and unipolar ferroelectrets with closed and open&#8208;cavity structures are explained first. Next, the preparation and piezoelectric behavior of ferroelectret films with closed, open and regular cavity structures using various materials are discussed. Three widely used models for predicting the piezoelectric coefficients (d33) are outlined. Methods for enhancing the piezoelectric performance such as optimized cavity design, utilization of fabric electrodes, injection of additional ions, application of DC bias voltage and synergy of foam structure and ferroelectric effect are illustrated. A variety of applications of ferroelectret films in acoustic devices, wearable monitors, pressure sensors and energy harvesters are presented. Finally, the future development trends of ferroelectrets towards fabrication and performance optimization are summarized along with its potential for integration with intelligent systems and large&#8208;scale preparation.

         <title>Tailorable Multi&#8208;Modular Pore&#8208;Space&#8208;Partitioned Vanadium Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Currently, few porous vanadium metal&#8208;organic frameworks (V&#8208;MOFs) are known and even fewer are obtainable as single crystals, resulting in limited information on their structures and properties. Here we demonstrate remarkable promise of V&#8208;MOFs by presenting an extensible family of V&#8208;MOFs with tailorable pore geometry and properties. The synthesis leverages inter&#8208;modular synergy on a tri&#8208;modular pore&#8208;partitioned platform. New V&#8208;MOFs show a broad range of structural features and sorption properties suitable for gas storage and separation applications for C2H2/CO2, C2H6/C2H4, and C3H8/C3H6. The c/a ratio of the hexagonal cell, a measure of pore shape, is tunable from 0.612 to1.258. Other tunable properties include pore size from 5.0 to 10.9 &#197; and surface area from 820 to 2964 m2 g&#8722;1. With C2H2/CO2 selectivity from 3.3 to 11 and high uptake capacity for C2H2 from 65.2 to 182 cm3 g&#8722;1 (298K, 1&#160;bar), an efficient separation is confirmed by breakthrough experiments. The near&#8208;record high uptake for C2H6 (166.8 cm3 g&#8722;1) contributes to the promise for C2H6&#8208;selective separation of C2H6/C2H4. The multi&#8208;module pore expansion enables transition from C3H6&#8208;selective to more desirable C3H8&#8208;selective separation with extraordinarily high C3H8 uptake (254.9 cm3 g&#8722;1) and high separation potential (1.25&#160;mmol g&#8722;1) for C3H8/C3H6 (50:50 v/v) mixture.

         <title>Superdurable Full&#8208;Life Superhydrophobic Composite Block</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Superhydrophobic materials are attractive for industrial development but plagued by poor mechanical stability. Herein, we have designed and fabricated a superdurable full&#8208;life superhydrophobic composite block by embedding near&#8208;zero contractive superhydrophobic silica aerogel into a rigid iron&#8208;nickel foam structured similarly to a regular dodecahedron. The synergistic protection afforded by these materials ensures superrobust mechanical stability for our composite block, which features a high compressive strength of up to &#8764;7.4&#160;MPa, and ultralow Taber abrasion of down to &#8764;0.567&#160;mm after withstanding 50,000 cycles, and highly efficient water harvesting capability of up to &#8764;3,114.3&#160;mg min&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at a supercooling degree of 40 K. This robust material system provides a novel strategy to design superhydrophobic materials capable of withstanding extreme conditions, including high temperature, humidity, pressure, and abrasion.

         <title>Supersoft Norbornene&#8208;Based Thermoplastic Elastomers with High Strength and Upper Service Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
With over 6 million tons produced annually, thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs) have become ubiquitous in modern society, due to their unique combination of elasticity, toughness, and reprocessability. Nevertheless, industrial TPEs display a tradeoff between softness and strength, along with low upper service temperatures, typically &#8804;100&#160;&#176;C. This limits their utility, such as in bio&#8208;interfacial applications where supersoft deformation is required in tandem with strength, in addition to applications that require thermal stability (e.g., encapsulation of electronics, seals/joints for aeronautics, protective clothing for firefighting, and biomedical devices that can be subjected to steam sterilization). Thus, combining softness, strength, and high thermal resistance into a single versatile TPE has remained an unmet opportunity. Through de novo design and synthesis of novel norbornene&#8208;based ABA triblock copolymers, we fill this gap. Ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) is employed to prepare TPEs with an unprecedented combination of properties, including skin&#8208;like moduli (&lt;100&#160;kPa), strength competitive with commercial TPEs (&gt;5&#160;MPa), and upper service temperatures akin to high&#8208;performance plastics (&#8764;260&#160;&#176;C). Furthermore, the materials are elastic, tough, reprocessable, and shelf stable (&#8805;2 months) without incorporation of plasticizer. Structure&#8208;property relationships identified herein inform development of next&#8208;generation TPEs that are both biologically soft yet thermomechanically durable.

         <title>3D Laser Writing of Low&#8208;Loss Cross&#8208;Section&#8208;Variable Type&#8208;I Optical Waveguide Passive/Active Integrated Devices in Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Optical waveguides fabricated in single crystals offer crucial passive/active optical components for photonic integrated circuits. Single crystals possess inherent advantages over their amorphous counterpart, such as lower optical losses in visible&#8208;to&#8208;mid&#8208;infrared band, larger peak emission cross&#8208;section, higher doping concentration. However, the writing of Type&#8208;I positive refractive index modified waveguides in single crystals using femtosecond laser technology presents significant challenges. Herein, we introduce a novel femtosecond laser direct writing technique that combines slit&#8208;shaping with an immersion oil objective to fabricate low&#8208;loss Type&#8208;I waveguides in single crystals. This approach allows for precise control of waveguide shape, size, mode&#8208;field and refractive index distribution, with a spatial resolution as high as 700&#160;nm and a high positive refractive index variation on the order of 10&#8722;2, introducing new degrees of freedom to design and fabricate passive/active optical waveguide devices. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we successfully produced a 7&#160;mm&#8208;long circular&#8208;shaped gain waveguide (&#8764;10&#160;&#181;m in diameter) in an Er3+&#8208;doped YAG single crystal, exhibiting a propagation loss as low as 0.23&#160;dB/cm, a net gain of &#8764;3&#160;dB and a polarization&#8208;insensitive character. The newly&#8208;developed technique is theoretically applicable to arbitrary single crystals, holding promising potential for various applications in integrated optics, optical communication, and photonic quantum circuits.

         <title>Physical Entanglements Supported Polymeric Form Stable Phase Change Materials with Ultra&#8208;high Melting Enthalpy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
With the rapid development of new energy and the upgrading of electronic devices, structurally stable phase change materials (PCMs) have attracted widespread attentions from both academia and industries. Traditional cross&#8208;linking, composites or micro&#8208;encapsulation methods for preparation of form stable PCMs usually sacrifice part of the phase change enthalpy and recyclability. Based on the basic polymer viscoelasticity and crystallization theories, in this work, a kind of novel recyclable polymeric PCM is developed by simple solution mixing ultra&#8208;high molecular weight of polyethylene oxide (UHMWPEO) with its chemical identical oligomer PEG. Rheological and leakage&#8208;proof experiments confirm that, even containing 90% of phase change fraction PEG oligomers, long&#8208;term of structure stability of PCMs could be achieved when the molecular weight of UHMWPEO is higher than 7000&#160;kg/mol due to their ultralong terminal relaxation time and large number of entanglements per chain. Furthermore, because of the reduced overall entanglement concentration, phase change enthalpy of PCMs could be greatly promoted, even reaching to approximate 185 J/g, which is larger than any PEG based form stable PCMs in literatures. This work provides a new strategy and mechanism for designing physical entanglements supported form stable PCMs with ultrahigh phase change enthalpies.

         <title>Brain Delivery of Protein Therapeutics by Cell Matrix&#8208;inspired Biomimetic Nanocarrier</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Protein therapeutics are anticipated to offer significant treatment options for central nervous system (CNS) diseases. However, the majority of proteins are unable to traverse the blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB) and reach their CNS target sites. Inspired by the natural environment of active proteins, we used the cell matrix components hyaluronic acid (HA) and protamine (PRTM) to self&#8208;assemble with proteins to form a protein&#8208;loaded biomimetic core and then incorporated it into ApoE3&#8208;reconstituted high&#8208;density lipoprotein (rHDL) to form a protein&#8208;loaded biomimetic nanocarrier (Protein&#8208;HA&#8208;PRTM&#8208;rHDL). This cell matrix&#8208;inspired biomimetic nanocarrier facilitated the penetration of protein therapeutics across the BBB and enabled their access to intracellular target sites. Specifically, CAT&#8208;HA&#8208;PRTM&#8208;rHDL facilitated rapid intracellular delivery and release of CAT via macropinocytosis&#8208;activated membrane fusion, resulting in improved spatial learning and memory in traumatic brain injury (TBI) model mice (significantly reduced the latency of TBI mice and doubled the number of crossing platforms), and enhanced motor function and prolonged survival in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) model mice (extended the median survival of ALS mice by more than 10 days). Collectively, this cell matrix&#8208;inspired nanoplatform enables the efficient CNS delivery of protein therapeutics and provides a novel approach for the treatment of CNS diseases.

         <title>3D Conjugated Hole Transporting Materials for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The orthogonal structure of the widely used hole transporting material (HTM) Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD imparts isotropic conductivity and excellent film&#8208;forming capability. However, inherently weak intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;molecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions result in low intrinsic hole mobility. Herein, a novel arylamine derivative, termed FTPE&#8208;ST, with a twist conjugated dibenzo[g,p]chrysene core and coplanar 3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) as extended donor units, was designed to enhance intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;molecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions, without compromising on solubility. The 3D configuration provides the material multi&#8208;direction charge transport as well as excellent solubility even in 2&#8208;methylanisole (2&#8208;MA), and its large conjugated delocalization backbone endows the HTM with a high hole mobility (7.2 &#215; 10&#8722;4 cm2V&#8722;1s&#8722;1). Moreover, the sulfur donors in the EDOT units coordinate to lead ions on the perovskite surface, leading to stronger interfacial interactions and the suppression of defects at the perovskite/HTM interface. As a result, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) employing FTPE&#8208;ST as the HTM achieve a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.21% with excellent long&#8208;time stability, which is one of the highest PCEs for non&#8208;spiro HTMs in n&#8208;i&#8208;p PSCs. In addition, the excellent film&#8208;forming capacity of the HTM enables the fabrication of FTPE&#8208;ST&#8208;based large&#8208;scale PSCs (1.0 cm2) and modules (29.0 cm2), which achieve PCEs of 24.21% (certificated 24.17%) and 21.27%, respectively.

&lt;p&gt;The orthogonal structure of the widely used hole transporting material (HTM) Spiro-OMeTAD imparts isotropic conductivity and excellent film-forming capability. However, inherently weak intra- and inter-molecular &#960;-&#960; interactions result in low intrinsic hole mobility. Herein, a novel arylamine derivative, termed FTPE-ST, with a twist conjugated dibenzo[g,p]chrysene core and coplanar 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) as extended donor units, was designed to enhance intra- and inter-molecular &#960;-&#960; interactions, without compromising on solubility. The 3D configuration provides the material multi-direction charge transport as well as excellent solubility even in 2-methylanisole (2-MA), and its large conjugated delocalization backbone endows the HTM with a high hole mobility (7.2 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;).

         <title>A Synergistic Chemoimmunotherapy System Leveraging PD&#8208;L1 Blocking and Bioorthogonal Prodrug Activation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Novel strategies to facilitate tumor&#8208;specific drug delivery and restore immune attacks remain challenging in overcoming the current limitations of chemoimmunotherapy. We propose an anti&#8208;tumor chemoimmunotherapy system comprising bioorthogonal reaction&#8208;ready group tetrazine (TZ) modified with an anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibody (&#945;PD&#8208;L1TZ) and TZ&#8208;activatable prodrug vinyl ether&#8208;doxorubicin (DOX&#8208;VE) for self&#8208;reinforced anti&#8208;tumor chemoimmunotherapy. The &#945;PD&#8208;L1TZ effectively disrupts the PD&#8208;L1/PD&#8208;1 interaction and activates the DOX prodrug in situ through the bioorthogonal click reaction of TZ and VE. Conversely, the activated DOX upregulates PD&#8208;L1 on the surface of tumor cells, facilitating tumor accumulation of &#945;PD&#8208;L1TZ and enhancing DOX&#8208;VE activation. Further, the activated DOX&#8208;induced immunogenic cell death of tumor cells, substantially improving the response efficiency of &#945;PD&#8208;L1 in an immune&#8208;suppressive tumor microenvironment. Thus, PD&#8208;L1 blocking and bioorthogonal in situ prodrug activation synergistically enhance the anti&#8208;tumor efficacy of the chemoimmunotherapy system. Therefore, the system significantly enhances &#945;PD&#8208;L1 tumor accumulation and prodrug activation and induces a robust immunological memory effect to prevent tumor recurrence and metastasis. Thus, a feasible chemoimmunotherapy combination regimen is presented.

         <title>KIr4O8 Nanowires with Rich Hydroxyl Promote Oxygen Evolution Reaction in Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolyzer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The sluggish kinetics for anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and insufficient catalytic performance over the corresponding Ir&#8208;based catalysts are still enormous challenges in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE). Herein, we report that KIr4O8 nanowires anode catalyst with more exposed active sites and rich hydroxyl achieves a current density of 1.0 A/cm2 at 1.68&#160;V and possesses excellent catalytic stability with 1230&#160;h in PEMWE. Combining in situ Raman spectroscopy and differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy results, we propose the modified adsorbate evolution mechanism that rich hydroxyl in the inherent structure of KIr4O8 nanowires directly participates in the catalytic process for favoring the OER. Density functional theory calculation results further suggest that the enhanced proximity between Ir (d) and O (p) band center in KIr4O8 can strengthen the covalence of Ir&#8208;O, facilitate the electron transfer between adsorbents and active sites, and decrease the energy barrier of rate&#8208;determining step from OH* to O* during the OER.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;stable Electrolytic Zn&#8208;I2 Batteries Based on Nanocarbon Wrapped by Highly Efficient Single&#8208;Atom Fe&#8208;NC Iodine Catalysts</title>

Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;iodine (Zn&#8208;I2) conversion batteries with iodine redox chemistry suffers the severe polyiodide shuttling and sluggish redox kinetics, which impede the battery lifespan and rate capability. Herein, we introduce an ultrastable Zn&#8208;I2 battery based on single&#8208;atom Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C encapsulated high&#8208;surface&#8208;area carbon (HC@FeNC) as the core&#8208;shell cathode materials, which accelerate the I&#8722;/I3&#8722;/I&#176; conversion significantly. The robust chemical&#8208;physical interaction between polyiodides and Fe&#8208;N4 sites tightly binds the polyiodide ions and suppresses the polyiodide shuttling, thereby significantly enhancing the coulombic efficiency. As a result, the core&#8208;shell HC@FeNC cathode endows the electrolytic Zn&#8211;I2 battery with an excellent capacity, remarkable rate capability, and an ultra&#8208;long lifespan over 60000 cycles. More importantly, a practical 253&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 pouch cell shows good capacity retention of 84% after 100 cycles, underscoring its considerable potential for commercial Zn&#8208;I2 batteries.

         <title>Interfacially enhanced superconductivity in Fe(Te,Se)/Bi4Te3 heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Realizing topological superconductivity by integrating high&#8208;transition&#8208;temperature (TC) superconductors with topological insulators can open new paths for quantum computing applications. Here, we report a new approach for increasing the superconducting transition temperature (TConset)$( {T_C^{onset}} )$ by interfacing the unconventional superconductor Fe(Te,Se) with the topological insulator Bi&#8208;Te system in the low&#8208;Se doping regime, near where superconductivity vanishes in the bulk. The critical finding is that the TConset$T_C^{onset}$ of Fe(Te,Se) increases from nominally non&#8208;superconducting to as high as 12.5&#160;K when Bi2Te3 is replaced with the topological phase Bi4Te3. Interfacing Fe(Te,Se) with Bi4Te3 is also found to be critical for stabilizing superconductivity in monolayer films where TConset$T_C^{onset}$ can be as high as 6&#160;K. Measurements of the electronic and crystalline structure of the Bi4Te3 layer reveal that a large electron transfer, epitaxial strain, and novel chemical reduction processes are critical factors for the enhancement of superconductivity. This novel route for enhancing TC in an important epitaxial system provides new insight on the nature of interfacial superconductivity and a platform to identify and utilize new electronic phases.

         <title>Non&#8208;equivalent Atomic Vibrations at Interfaces in a Polar Superlattice</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In heterostructures made from polar materials, e.g., AlN&#8208;GaN&#8208;AlN, the non&#8208;equivalence of the two interfaces has long been recognized as a critical aspect of their electronic properties, in that they host different two&#8208;dimensional carrier gases. Interfaces play an important role in the vibrational properties of materials, where interface states enhance thermal conductivity and can generate unique infrared&#8208;optical activity. The non&#8208;equivalence of the corresponding interface atomic vibrations, however, has not been investigated so far due to a lack of experimental techniques with both high spatial and high spectral resolution. Herein we experimentally demonstrate the non&#8208;equivalence of AlN&#8208;(Al0.65Ga0.35)N and (Al0.65Ga0.35)N&#8208;AlN interface vibrations using monochromated electron energy&#8208;loss spectroscopy in the scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM&#8208;EELS) and employ density&#8208;functional&#8208;theory (DFT) calculations to gain insights in the physical origins of observations. We demonstrate that STEM&#8208;EELS possesses sensitivity to the displacement vector of the vibrational modes as well as the frequency, which is as critical to understanding vibrations as polarization in optical spectroscopies. The combination enables direct mapping of the non&#8208;equivalent interface phonons between materials with different phonon polarizations. The results demonstrate the capacity to carefully assess the vibrational properties of complex heterostructures where interface states dominate the functional properties.

         <title>Bioprinting&#8208;assisted Tissue Assembly for Structural and Functional Modulation of Engineered Heart Tissue Mimicking Left Ventricular Myocardial Fiber Orientation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Left ventricular twist is influenced by the unique oriented structure of myocardial fibers. Replicating this intricate structural&#8208;functional relationship in an in vitro heart model remains challenging, mainly due to the difficulties in achieving a complex structure with synchrony between layers. This study introduces a novel approach through the utilization of bioprinting&#8208;assisted tissue assembly (BATA)&#8212;a synergistic integration of bioprinting and tissue assembly strategies. By flexibly manufacturing tissue modules and assembly platforms, BATA can create structures that traditional methods find difficult to achieve. This approach integrates engineered heart tissue (EHT) modules, each with intrinsic functional and structural characteristics, into a layered, multi&#8208;oriented tissue in a controlled manner. EHTs assembled in different orientations exhibit various contractile forces and electrical signal patterns. The BATA is capable of constructing complex myocardial fiber orientations within a chamber&#8208;like structure (MoCha). MoCha replicates the native cardiac architecture by exhibiting three layers and three alignment directions, and it reproduces the left ventricular twist by exhibiting synchronized contraction between layers and mimicking the native cardiac architecture. The potential of BATA extends to engineering tissues capable of constructing and functioning as complete organs on a large scale. This advancement holds the promise of realizing future organ&#8208;on&#8208;demand technology.

         <title>Peptide&#8208;AIE Nanofibers Functionalized Sutures with Antimicrobial Activity and Subcutaneous Traceability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
As one of the most widely used medical device, sutures face challenges related to surgical site infections (SSIs) and lack of subcutaneous traceability. In the present study, we have developed a facile and effective approach using peptide&#8208;AIE nanofibers (NFs&#8208;K18) to create fluorescent&#8208;traceable antimicrobial sutures, which have been applied to four commercially available sutures. The functionalized sutures of PGAS&#8208;NFs&#8208;K18 and PGLAS&#8208;NFs&#8208;K18 exhibited fluorescence with excellent penetration from 4&#160;mm chicken breasts. They also demonstrated remarkable stability after 24&#160;h of white light illumination and threading through chicken breasts 10 times. These sutures efficiently generated ROS, resulting in a significant suppression of four clinical bacteria, with the highest antimicrobial rate of nearly 100%. Moreover, the sutures exhibited favorable hemocompatibility and biocompatibility. In vivo experiments demonstrated that the optimized PGLAS&#8208;NFs&#8208;K18 suture displayed potent antimicrobial activity against MRSA, effectively inhibiting inflammation and promoting tissue healing in both skin wound and abdominal wall wound models, outperforming the commercially available Coated VICRYL&#174; Plus Antibacterial suture. Importantly, PGLAS&#8208;NFs&#8208;K18 exhibited sensitive subcutaneous traceability, allowing for accurate in situ monitoring of its degradation. We believe that this straightforward strategy offers a new pathway for inhibiting SSIs and monitoring the status of sutures.

         <title>Spatially Precise Genetic Engineering at the Electrode&#8208;Tissue Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops a versatile AAV&#8208;shRNA&#8208;delivery probe that seamlessly integrates abiotic and biotic engineering principles into the electrode&#8208;tissue interface. This system facilitates the highly effective downregulation of target gene within specific cell types at the electrode&#8208;tissue interface, and capability of recording neuronal activities continuously for several months, which is promising for clinical research of gene therapy to neurodegenerative diseases.








Abstract
The interface between electrodes and neural tissues plays a pivotal role in determining the efficacy and fidelity of neural activity recording and modulation. While considerable efforts have been made to improve the electrode&#8208;tissue interface, the majority of studies have primarily concentrated on the development of biocompatible neural electrodes through abiotic materials and structural engineering. In this study, an approach is presented that seamlessly integrates abiotic and biotic engineering principles into the electrode&#8208;tissue interface. Specifically, ultraflexible neural electrodes with short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) designed to silence the expression of endogenous genes within neural tissues are combined. The system facilitates shRNA&#8208;mediated knockdown of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) and polypyrimidine tract&#8208;binding protein 1 (PTBP1), two essential genes associated in neural survival/growth and neurogenesis, within specific cell populations located at the electrode&#8208;tissue interface. Additionally, it is demonstrated that the downregulation of PTEN in neurons can result in an enlargement of neuronal cell bodies at the electrode&#8208;tissue interface. Furthermore, the system enables long&#8208;term monitoring of neuronal activities following PTEN knockdown in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease and traumatic brain injury. The system provides a versatile approach for genetically engineering the electrode&#8208;tissue interface with unparalleled precision, paving the way for the development of regenerative electronics and next&#8208;generation brain&#8211;machine interfaces.

         <title>Vacancy&#8208;Driven High&#8208;Performance Metabolic Assay for Diagnosis and Therapeutic Evaluation of Depression</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance platform based on vacancy&#8208;engineered Co3O4 for rapid diagnosis and therapeutic evaluation of depression is developed. The vacancy&#8208;engineered nanoparticles enable up to 20&#8208;fold signal amplification compared to commercial products, featured by superior photoelectric response and photothermal properties. This platform achieves superior diagnostic performance for depression (AUC: 0.941&#8211;0.980; Accuracy: 92%&#8722;94%), driving progress in advanced matrices toward precision medicine.








Abstract
Depression is one of the most common mental illnesses and is a well&#8208;known risk factor for suicide, characterized by low overall efficacy (&lt;50%) and high relapse rate (40%). A rapid and objective approach for screening and prognosis of depression is highly desirable but still awaits further development. Herein, a high&#8208;performance metabolite&#8208;based assay to aid the diagnosis and therapeutic evaluation of depression by developing a vacancy&#8208;engineered cobalt oxide (Vo&#8208;Co3O4) assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometer platform is presented. The easy&#8208;prepared nanoparticles with optimal vacancy achieve a considerable signal enhancement, characterized by favorable charge transfer and increased photothermal conversion. The optimized Vo&#8208;Co3O4 allows for a direct and robust record of plasma metabolic fingerprints (PMFs). Through machine learning of PMFs, high&#8208;performance depression diagnosis is achieved, with the areas under the curve (AUC) of 0.941&#8211;0.980 and an accuracy of over 92%. Furthermore, a simplified diagnostic panel for depression is established, with a desirable AUC value of 0.933. Finally, proline levels are quantified in a follow&#8208;up cohort of depressive patients, highlighting the potential of metabolite quantification in the therapeutic evaluation of depression. This work promotes the progression of advanced matrixes and brings insights into the management of depression.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Channel Ca2+ Nanomodulator Induces Intracellular Ca2+ Disorders via Endogenous Ca2+ Redistribution for Tumor Radiosensitization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A capsaicin&#8208;conjugated and nitric oxide&#8208;grafted self&#8208;assembling peptide based nanofiber is presented, serving as a tumor&#8208;specific dual&#8208;channel Ca2+ nanomodulator with synchronous stimulation of the extracellular Ca2+ influx and the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release performances for inducing intracellular Ca2+ disorders and thus achieving tumor radiosensitization.








Abstract
Tumor cells harness Ca2+ to maintain cellular homeostasis and withstand external stresses from various treatments. Here, a dual&#8208;channel Ca2+ nanomodulator (CAP&#8208;P&#8208;NO) is constructed that can induce irreversible intracellular Ca2+ disorders via the redistribution of tumor&#8208;inherent Ca2+ for disrupting cellular homeostasis and thus improving tumor radiosensitivity. Stimulated by tumor&#8208;overexpressed acid and glutathione, capsaicin and nitric oxide are successively escaped from CAP&#8208;P&#8208;NO to activate the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 and the ryanodine receptor for the influx of extracellular Ca2+ and the release of Ca2+ in the endoplasmic reticulum, respectively. The overwhelming level of Ca2+ in tumor cells not only impairs the function of organelles but also induces widespread changes in the gene transcriptome, including the downregulation of a set of radioresistance&#8208;associated genes. Combining CAP&#8208;P&#8208;NO treatment with radiotherapy achieves a significant suppression against both pancreatic and patient&#8208;derived hepatic tumors with negligible side effects. Together, the study provides a feasible approach for inducing tumor&#8208;specific intracellular Ca2+ overload via endogenous Ca2+ redistribution and demonstrates the great potential of Ca2+ disorder therapy in enhancing the sensitivity for tumor radiotherapy.

         <title>Constructing Lysozyme Protective Layer via Conformational Transition for Aqueous Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The practical applications for aqueous Zn ion batteries are promising yet still impeded by the severe side reactions on Zn metal. Here, a lysozyme protective layer (LPL) is prepared on Zn metal surface by a simple and facile self&#8208;adsorption strategy. The lysozyme protective layer exhibits extremely strong adhesion on Zn metal to provide stable interface during long&#8208;term cycling. In addition, the self&#8208;adsorption strategy triggered by the hydrophobicity&#8208;induced aggregation effect endows the protective layer with a gap&#8208;free and compacted morphology which can reject free water for effective side reaction inhibition performance. More importantly, the lysozyme conformation is transformed from &#945;&#8208;helix to &#946;&#8208;sheet structure before layer formation, thus abundant functional groups are exposed to interact with Zn2+ for electrical double layer modification, desolvation energy decrease, and ion diffusion kinetics acceleration. Consequently, the LPL renders the symmetrical Zn battery with ultra&#8208;long cycling performance for more than 1200&#160;h under high Zn depth of discharge (DOD) for 77.7%, and the Zn/Zn0.25V2O5 pouch cell with low N/P ratio of 2.1 at high Zn utilization of 48% for over 300 cycles. This study proposes a facile and low&#8208;cost method on constructing stable protective layer of Zn metal for high Zn utilization aqueous devices.

         <title>A Membrane&#8208;Free Rechargeable Seawater Battery Unlocked by Lattice Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new rechargeable seawater battery that directly utilizes natural seawater as both anolyte and catholyte is successfully constructed. The lattice expansion strategy transforms electrochemically inert anatase TiO2 into a high&#8208;specific&#8208;capacity anode in various aqueous electrolytes. This approach effectively addresses the anode challenge in rechargeable seawater batteries, which opens new perspectives for designing high&#8208;energy and scalable aqueous batteries with seawater.








Abstract
Seawater batteries that directly utilize natural seawater as electrolytes are ideal sustainable aqueous devices with high safety, exceedingly low cost, and environmental friendliness. However, the present seawater batteries are either primary batteries or rechargeable half&#8208;seawater/half&#8208;nonaqueous batteries because of the lack of suitable anode working in seawater. Here, a unique lattice engineering to unlock the electrochemically inert anatase TiO2 anode to be highly active for the reversible uptake of multiple cations (Na+, Mg2+, and Ca2+) in aqueous electrolytes is demonstrated. Density functional theory calculations&#160;further reveal the origin of the unprecedented charge storage behaviors, which can be attributed to the significant reduction of the cations diffusion barrier within the lattice, i.e., from 1.5 to 0.4&#160;eV. As a result, the capacities of anatase TiO2 with 2.4% lattice expansion are &#8776;100 times higher than the routine one in natural seawater, and &#8776;200 times higher in aqueous Na+ electrolyte. The finding will significantly advance aqueous seawater energy storage devices closer to practical applications.

         <title>Fluorinated Organic Polymers for Cancer Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review article focuses on introducing the applications of fluorinated polymers in tumor drug therapy, elucidating their molecular structures, synthetic pathways and functional properties, while discussing the challenges currently faced in this field and potential future directions.








Abstract
In the realm of cancer therapy, the spotlight is on nanoscale pharmaceutical delivery systems, especially polymer&#8208;based nanoparticles, for their enhanced drug dissolution, extended presence in the bloodstream, and precision targeting achieved via surface engineering. Leveraging the amplified permeation and retention phenomenon, these systems concentrate therapeutic agents within tumor tissues. Nonetheless, the hurdles of systemic toxicity, biological barriers, and compatibility with living systems persist. Fluorinated polymers, distinguished by their chemical idiosyncrasies, are poised for extensive biomedical applications, notably in stabilizing drug metabolism, augmenting lipophilicity, and optimizing bioavailability. Material science heralds the advent of fluorinated polymers that, by integrating fluorine atoms, unveil a suite of drug delivery merits: the hydrophobic traits of fluorinated alkyl chains ward off lipid or protein disruption, the carbon&#8211;fluorine bond's stability extends the drug's lifecycle in the system, and a lower alkalinity coupled with a diminished ionic charge bolsters the drug's ability to traverse cellular membranes. This comprehensive review delves into the utilization of fluorinated polymers for oncological pharmacotherapy, elucidating their molecular architecture, synthetic pathways, and functional attributes, alongside an exploration of their empirical strengths and the quandaries they encounter in both experimental and clinical settings.

         <title>Completely Inorganic Deep Eutectic Solvents for Efficient and Recyclable Liquid&#8211;Liquid Interface Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A completely inorganic deep eutectic solvent (IDES) is synthesized by ZnCl2 and phosphoric acid through hydrogen bonding (Cl&#183;&#183;&#183;H&#9472;O) and coordination (Zn&#183;&#183;&#183;O&#9552;P). Due to the presence of composite catalytic active site (Zn&#183;&#183;&#183;O&#9552;P), the IDES could convert the oxidant into a triple reactive oxygen species with stronger oxidation ability, leading to rapid and efficient oxidation removal of thiophenes from fuel.








Abstract
Organic acid&#8208;based deep eutectic solvents (DESs) as catalysts always suffer from weak stability and low recyclability due to the accumulation of organic oxidative products in the DES phase. Herein, a completely inorganic deep eutectic solvent (IDES) ZnCl2/PA with zinc chloride (ZnCl2) and phosphoric acid (PA) as precursors is constructed to realize liquid&#8211;liquid interface catalysis for desulfurization of fuel and product self&#8208;separation for the first time. Owing to the inorganic nature, the organic oxidative products are accumulated at the interface between the IDES and fuel rather than the IDES phase. With this unique feature, the IDES can be reused for at least 15 times without any further treatment in oxidative desulfurization process, showing a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art cycle&#8208;regeneration stability. Moreover, compared with the reported organic DESs, the IDES also reveals more attractive catalytic oxidative desulfurization performance. Experimental and theoretical studies indicate that the strong coordination Zn&#183;&#183;&#183;O&#9552;P and the strong adsorption energy between IDES and sulfides enhance the activation of H2O2 to reactive oxygen species, leading to the superior catalytic performance in oxidative desulfurization of fuel.

         <title>A General Molecular Structural Design for Highly Efficient Photopyroptosis that can be Activated within 10 s Irradiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and rational principle is developed to design the molecular structure of photosensitizers for highly efficient photopyroptosis. Under the guidance of this principle, the pyroptotic trigger can be achieved in a minimum of 10 s of irradiation with a substantially low light dosage (0.4 J&#160;cm&#8315;2). In photodynamic therapy, immunotherapy with high tumor inhibition rates is achieved by applying the synthetic molecule alone.








Abstract
Photopyroptosis is an emerging research branch of photodynamic therapy (PDT), whereas there remains a lack of molecular structural principles to fabricate photosensitizers for triggering a highly efficient pyroptosis. Herein, a general and rational structural design principle to implement this hypothesis, is proposed. The principle relies on the clamping of cationic moieties (e.g., pyridinium, imidazolium) onto one photosensitive core to facilitate a considerable mitochondrial targeting (both of the inner and the outer membranes) of the molecules, thus maximizing the photogenerated reactive oxygen species (ROS) at the specific site to trigger the gasdermin E&#8208;mediated pyroptosis. Through this design, the pyroptotic trigger can be achieved in a minimum of 10 s of irradiation with a substantially low light dosage (0.4 J&#160;cm&#8315;2), compared to relevant work reported (up to 60 J&#160;cm&#8315;2). Moreover, immunotherapy with high tumor inhibition efficiency is realized by applying the synthetic molecules alone. This structural paradigm is valuable for deepening the understanding of PDT (especially the mitochondrial&#8208;targeted PDT) from the perspective of pyroptosis, toward the future development of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art form of PDT.

         <title>Wetting Transparency of Single&#8208;Layer Graphene on Liquid Substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Graphene's wetting transparency offers promising avenues for creating multifunctional devices by allowing real&#8208;time wettability control on liquid substrates via the flow of different liquids beneath graphene. Despite its potential, direct measurement of floating graphene's wettability remains a challenge, hindering the exploration of these applications. The current study develops an experimental methodology to assess the wetting transparency of single&#8208;layer graphene on liquid substrates. By employing contact angle measurements and Neumann's Triangle model, the challenge of evaluating the wettability of floating free&#8208;suspended single&#8208;layer graphene has been addressed. The research reveals that for successful contact angle measurements, the testing and substrate liquids must be immiscible. Using diiodomethane as the testing liquid and ammonium persulfate solution as liquid substrate, the study demonstrates the near&#8208;complete wetting transparency of graphene. Furthermore, it successfully showcases the feasibility of real&#8208;time wettability control using graphene on liquid substrates. This work not only advances the understanding of graphene's interaction with liquid interfaces but also suggests a new avenue for the development of multifunctional materials and devices by exploiting the unique wetting transparency of graphene.

         <title>A Topological Parametric Phonon Oscillator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Topological bosonic systems have recently aroused intense interests in exploring exotic phenomena that have no counterparts in electronic systems. The squeezed bosonic interaction in these systems is particularly interesting, because it can modify the vacuum fluctuations of topological states, drive them into instabilities, and lead to topological parametric oscillators. However, these phenomena remain experimentally elusive because of limited nonlinearities in most existing topological bosonic systems. Here, a topological parametric phonon oscillator is experimentally realized based on a nonlinear nanoelectromechanical Dirac&#8208;vortex cavity with strong squeezed interaction. Specifically, the Dirac&#8208;vortex cavity is parametrically driven to provide phase&#8208;sensitive amplification for topological phonons, leading to the observation of coherent parametric phonon oscillation above the threshold. Additionally, it is confirmed that the random frequency variation caused by fabrication disorders can be suppressed effectively by increasing the cavity size, while the free spectral range reduces at a much slower rate, which benefit the realization of large&#8208;area single&#8208;mode lasers. Our results represent an important advance in experimental investigations of topological physics with large bosonic nonlinearities and parametric gain.

         <title>Porous Aromatic Frameworks Enabling Polyiodide Confinement toward High Capacity and Long Lifespan Zinc&#8211;Iodine Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8211;iodine batteries (AZIBs) are attracting increasing attention because of their high safety and abundance of resources. However, the performance of AZIBs is compromised by inadequate confinement of soluble polyiodides, the undesired shuttle effect, and slow reaction kinetics. In this study, a porous aromatic framework (PAF) with abundant benzene motifs and a well&#8208;organized pore structure is adopted as the iodine host, which exhibits high iodine adsorption capacity and robust polyiodide confinement. Both experimental characterizations and theoretical simulations indicate that the interactions between iodine species and the PAF&#8208;1 facilitate the redox reaction by coupling the electronic structures of the active species in the framework. A comparison of PAF&#8208;1, PAF&#8208;5, and PAF&#8208;11 also emphasizes the structural advantages of the high surface area and interconnected three&#8208;dimensional channels of PAF&#8208;1. Consequently, the I2@PAF&#8208;1 cathode can deliver a high capacity of 328 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 C, outstanding rate performance (86% retention at 10 C), and a stable cycling life of 20000 cycles. The robust polyiodide confinement and superb electrochemical performance of Zn&#8211;I2@PAF&#8208;1 provide insights into the practical application of PAFs as excellent electrode materials for AZIBs.

         <title>Photothermal CO2 Catalysis toward the Synthesis of Solar Fuel: From Material and Reactor Engineering to Techno&#8208;Economic Analysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores recent progress in photothermal CO2 conversion, focusing on catalyst design, mechanism analysis, reactor engineering, and techno&#8208;economic aspects. It emphasizes the need to address rising atmospheric CO2 levels by converting CO2 into valuable chemicals using renewable solar energy, offering insights and future research directions in managing the anthropogenic carbon cycle.








Abstract
Carbon dioxide (CO2), a member of greenhouse gases, contributes significantly to maintaining a tolerable environment for all living species. However, with the development of modern society and the utilization of fossil fuels, the concentration of atmospheric CO2 has increased to 400&#160;ppm, resulting in a serious greenhouse effect. Thus, converting CO2 into valuable chemicals is highly desired, especially with renewable solar energy, which shows great potential with the manner of photothermal catalysis. In this review, recent advancements in photothermal CO2 conversion are discussed, including the design of catalysts, analysis of mechanisms, engineering of reactors, and the corresponding techno&#8208;economic analysis. A guideline for future investigation and the anthropogenic carbon cycle are provided.

         <title>Achieving High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries by Modulating Li+ Desolvation Barrier with Liquid Crystal Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sulfonate anion&#8208;rich interface is constructed by tape&#8208;casting a liquid crystal polymer&#8208;containing layer on the separator to facilitate Li+ desolvation and improve Li2S precipitation kinetics. With this well&#8208;thought&#8208;out design, the battery performance exhibits excellent rate capability and long&#8208;term cycling stability. More importantly, under a low E/S ratio and high sulfur loading condition, the pouch cell delivers a remarkable areal capacity.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries offer high theoretical capacity but are hindered by poor rate capability and cycling stability due to sluggish Li2S precipitation kinetics. Here a sulfonate&#8208;group&#8208;rich liquid crystal polymer (poly&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;disulfonyl&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;benzidine terephthalamide, PBDT) is designed and fabricated to accelerate Li2S precipitation by promoting the desolvation of Li+ from electrolyte. PBDT&#8208;modified separators are employed to assemble Li&#8211;S batteries, which deliver a remarkable rate capacity (761 mAh g&#8722;1 at 4 C) and cycling stability (500 cycles with an average decay rate of 0.088% per cycle at 0.5 C). A PBDT&#8208;based pouch cell even delivers an exceptional capacity of &#8776;1400 mAh g&#8722;1 and an areal capacity of &#8776;11 mAh cm&#8722;2 under lean&#8208;electrolyte and high&#8208;sulfur&#8208;loading condition, demonstrating promise for practical applications. Results of Raman spectra, molecular dynamic (MD) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the abundant anionic sulfonate groups of PBDT aid in Li+ desolvation by attenuating Li+&#8208;solvent interactions and lowering the desolvation energy barrier. Plus, the polysulfide adsorption/catalysis is also excluded via electrostatic repulsion. This work elucidates the critical impact of Li+ desolvation on Li&#8211;S batteries and provides a new design direction for advanced Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <dc:description>
In this review, the latest advancements in work function&#8208;guided electrocatalyst design for diverse electrochemical energy applications are comprehensively analyzed. The development of work function&#8208;based catalytic activity descriptors is discussed.

Abstract
The development of high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts for energy conversion reactions is crucial for advancing global energy sustainability. The design of catalysts based on their electronic properties (e.g., work function) has gained significant attention recently. Although numerous reviews on electrocatalysis have been provided, no such reports on work function&#8208;guided electrocatalyst design are available. Herein, a comprehensive summary of the latest advancements in work function&#8208;guided electrocatalyst design for diverse electrochemical energy applications is provided. This includes the development of work function&#8208;based catalytic activity descriptors, and the design of both monolithic and heterostructural catalysts. The measurement of work function is first discussed and the applications of work function&#8208;based catalytic activity descriptors for various reactions are fully analyzed. Subsequently, the work function&#8208;regulated material&#8208;electrolyte interfacial electron transfer (IET) is employed for monolithic catalyst design, and methods for regulating the work function and optimizing the catalytic performance of catalysts are discussed. In addition, key strategies for tuning the work function&#8208;governed material&#8208;material IET in heterostructural catalyst design are examined. Finally, perspectives on work function determination, work function&#8208;based activity descriptors, and catalyst design are put forward to guide future research. This work paves the way to the work function&#8208;guided rational design of efficient electrocatalysts for sustainable energy applications.

         <title>Sterically Hindered Oleogel&#8208;Based Underwater Adhesive Enabled by Mesh&#8208;Tailoring Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing the mesh&#8208;tailoring strategy, bio&#8208;based epoxidized soybean oil (ESO) molecules are precisely entrapped in highly crosslinked polyurethane network, creating a sterically hindered oleogel&#8208;based underwater adhesive (OUA). The well&#8208;designed OUA exhibits facile fabrication, exceptional substrate universality, ultrahigh adhesive strength, remarkable environmental adaptability, excellent stability, and broad application potential.








Abstract
Underwater adhesives hold significant relevance in daily life and numerous industrial applications. Despite considerable efforts, developing scalable, high&#8208;performance underwater adhesives through a simple and effective method remains a formidable challenge. This study presents a novel mesh&#8208;tailoring strategy for in situ, rapid, and ultrastrong oleogel&#8208;based underwater adhesives (OUA), which comprises a highly crosslinked polyurethane network with a matching mesh size (&#8776;2.22&#160;nm) that precisely entraps bio&#8208;based epoxidized soybean oil (ESO) molecules (&#8776;2.31&#160;nm) by steric hindrance effect. This oleogel exhibits unprecedented robust mechanical properties (&#8776;35&#160;MPa) and maintains stability under extreme conditions, including high temperatures (100&#160;&#176;C), high pressures (30&#160;MPa), and immersion in various solvents (water, ethanol, or ESO). In particular, this oleogel displays high hydrophobicity, rapid curing, and strong interface affinity, resulting in ultrahigh underwater adhesion strength (up to 2.13&#160;MPa) and exceptional substrate universality. Moreover, the remarkable environmental adaptability and stability of OUA enable its use in harsh aqueous environments, including acidic/alkaline, saline, and extreme temperature solutions. The comprehensive capabilities of the OUA underscore its potential for building underwater structures, repairing leaky containers, and sealing broken submarine pipelines. This research establishes the foundation for the designing of next&#8208;generation underwater adhesives and offers fresh perspectives for exploring oleogel&#8208;based materials.

         <title>Immunoengineering Biomaterials for Musculoskeletal Tissue Repair across Lifespan</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review addresses the intersection of the immune system and aging in biomaterial&#8208;mediated musculoskeletal tissue repair. The authors provide an overview of how aging impacts tissue physiology, immunity, and biomaterial responses. Then, the authors discuss the roles of the immune system in biomaterial&#8208;mediated repair of cartilage, muscle, and bone; and the impact of aging on biomaterial responses in these tissues.








Abstract
Musculoskeletal diseases and injuries are among the leading causes of pain and morbidity worldwide. Broad efforts have focused on developing pro&#8208;regenerative biomaterials to treat musculoskeletal conditions; however, these approaches have yet to make a significant clinical impact. Recent studies have demonstrated that the immune system is central in orchestrating tissue repair and that targeting pro&#8208;regenerative immune responses can improve biomaterial therapeutic outcomes. However, aging is a critical factor negatively affecting musculoskeletal tissue repair and immune function. Hence, understanding how age affects the response to biomaterials is essential for improving musculoskeletal biomaterial therapies. This review focuses on the intersection of the immune system and aging in response to biomaterials for musculoskeletal tissue repair. The article introduces the general impacts of aging on tissue physiology, the immune system, and the response to biomaterials. Then, it explains how the adaptive immune system guides the response to injury and biomaterial implants in cartilage, muscle, and bone and discusses how aging impacts these processes in each tissue type. The review concludes by highlighting future directions for the development and translation of personalized immunomodulatory biomaterials for musculoskeletal tissue repair.

         <title>Catheter&#8208;Directed Ionic Liquid Embolic Agent for Rapid Portal Vein Embolization, Segmentectomy, and Bile Duct Ablation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Embolic materials currently used for PVE do not treat the tumor, risking tumor progression during the interval between PVE and surgery. Here, an ionic&#8208;liquid&#8208;based embolic material (LEAD) is developed that can embolize, ablate, and deliver therapeutics. With its ease of use and a high safety profile demonstrated in animal studies, LEAD offers a potential alternative to tumor ablation with or without PVE for FLR growth.









Abstract
Embolic materials currently in use for portal vein embolization (PVE) do not treat the tumor, which poses a risk for tumor progression during the interval between PVE and surgical resection. Here, is developed an ionic&#8208;liquid&#8208;based embolic material (LEAD) for portal vein embolization, liver ablation, and drug delivery. LEAD is optimized and characterized for diffusivity, X&#8208;ray visibility, and cytotoxicity. In the porcine renal embolization model, LEAD delivered from the main renal artery reached vasculature down to 10 microns with uniform tissue ablation and delivery of small and large therapeutics. In non&#8208;survival and survival porcine experiments, successful PVE is achieved in minutes, leading to the expected chemical segmentectomy, and delivery of a large protein drug (i.e., Nivolumab) with LEAD. In cholangiocarcinoma mouse tumor models and in ex vivo human tumors, LEAD consistently achieved an effective ablation and wide drug distribution. Furthermore, various strains of drug&#8208;resistant patient&#8208;derived bacteria showed significant susceptibility to LEAD, suggesting that LEAD may also prevent infectious complications resulting from tissue ablation. With its capabilities to embolize, ablate, and deliver therapeutics, ease of use, and a high safety profile demonstrated in animal studies, LEAD offers a potential alternative to tumor ablation with or without PVE for FLR growth.

&lt;p&gt;Embolic materials currently used for PVE do not treat the tumor, risking tumor progression during the interval between PVE and surgery. Here, an ionic-liquid-based embolic material (LEAD) is developed that can embolize, ablate, and deliver therapeutics. With its ease of use and a high safety profile demonstrated in animal studies, LEAD offers a potential alternative to tumor ablation with or without PVE for FLR growth.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Embolic materials currently in use for portal vein embolization (PVE) do not treat the tumor, which poses a risk for tumor progression during the interval between PVE and surgical resection. Here, is developed an ionic-liquid-based embolic material (LEAD) for portal vein embolization, liver ablation, and drug delivery. LEAD is optimized and characterized for diffusivity, X-ray visibility, and cytotoxicity. In the porcine renal embolization model, LEAD delivered from the main renal artery reached vasculature down to 10 microns with uniform tissue ablation and delivery of small and large therapeutics. In non-survival and survival porcine experiments, successful PVE is achieved in minutes, leading to the expected chemical segmentectomy, and delivery of a large protein drug (i.e., Nivolumab) with LEAD. In cholangiocarcinoma mouse tumor models and in ex vivo human tumors, LEAD consistently achieved an effective ablation and wide drug distribution. Furthermore, various strains of drug-resistant patient-derived bacteria showed significant susceptibility to LEAD, suggesting that LEAD may also prevent infectious complications resulting from tissue ablation. With its capabilities to embolize, ablate, and deliver therapeutics, ease of use, and a high safety profile demonstrated in animal studies, LEAD offers a potential alternative to tumor ablation with or without PVE for FLR growth.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Harnessing Nanochaperone&#8208;Mediated Autophagy for Selective Clearance of Pathogenic Tau Protein in Alzheimer's Disease</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research demonstrates a nanochaperone&#8208;mediated&#8208;autophagy&#8208;based strategy that can specifically recognize pathogenic tau and recruit them, thereby maintaining the tau homeostasis to guarantee microtubule stability. Meanwhile, the captured pathogenic tau can be sequestered by in situ autophagy activation and transported along the stabilized microtubule to achieve successful fusion with lysosomes, resulting in selective clearance of pathogenic tau protein in Alzheimer's disease.








Abstract
Accumulation of pathological tau is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which correlates more closely with cognitive impairment than does the amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) burden. Autophagy is a powerful process for the clearance of toxic proteins including aberrant tau. However, compromised autophagy is demonstrated in neurodegeneration including AD, and current autophagy inducers remain enormously challenging due to inability of restoring autophagy pathway and lack of targeting specificity. Here, pathogenic tau&#8208;specific autophagy based on customized nanochaperone is developed for AD treatment. In this strategy, the nanochaperone can selectively bind to pathogenic tau and maintain tau homeostasis, thereby ensuring microtubule stability which is important for autophagy pathway. Meanwhile, the bound pathogenic tau can be sequestered in autophagosomes by in situ autophagy activation of nanochaperone. Consequently, autophagosomes wrapping with pathogenic tau are able to be trafficked along the stabilized microtubule to achieve successful fusion with lysosomes, resulting in the enhancement of autophagic flux and pathologic tau clearance. After treatment with this nanochaperone&#8208;mediated autophagy strategy, the tau burden, neuron damages, and cognitive deficits of AD mice are significantly alleviated in the brain. Therefore, this work represents a promising candidate for AD&#8208;targeted therapy and provides new insights into future design of anti&#8208;neurodegeneration drugs.

         <title>AMPLON: Amplifying DNA with Multiarm Priming and Looping Optimization of Nucleic Acid</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The article introduces a groundbreaking method called amplifying DNA with multiarm priming and looping optimization of nucleic acid (AMPLON) for efficient DNA amplification under isothermal conditions. By utilizing unique multiarm polyethylene glycol&#8211;DNA primers, AMPLON demonstrates high sensitivity and specificity in nucleic acid detection. With its potential to enhance nucleic acid amplification, AMPLON holds promise for significant advancements in biotechnology, medicine and healthcare.








Abstract
Nucleic acid amplification, the bedrock of biotechnology and molecular diagnostics, surges in applications&#8212;especially isothermal approaches&#8212;heightening the demand for advanced and precisely engineered methods. Here, a novel approach for amplifying DNA with multiarm priming and looping optimization of nucleic acid (AMPLON) is presented. AMPLON relies on a novel polymeric material with unique set of multiarm polyethylene glycol&#8211;DNA primers for efficient DNA amplification under isothermal conditions. Each arm carries single&#8208;stranded DNA complementing the sense or antisense sequence of the target DNA. The amplification reaction begins with antisense arms binding to the target DNA, forming a template for sense&#8208;carrying arms to direct multiarm large DNA amplicon synthesis through successive DNA looping and unlooping steps. Using human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV&#8208;1) as a model clinical target, AMPLON exhibits high sensitivity, detecting target concentrations as low as 100 copies mL&#8722;1. Compared to a quantitative real&#8208;time polymerase chain reaction assay using sensitive primers, AMPLON reliably identifies HIV&#8208;1 RNA in plasma samples (n = 20) with a significant agreement rate of 95%. With its ability to achieve highly specific and sensitive target amplification within 30 min, AMPLON holds immense potential to transform the field of nucleic acid research and unleashing new possibilities in medicine and biotechnology.

         <title>Nonflammable Succinonitrile&#8208;Based Deep Eutectic Electrolyte for Intrinsically Safe High&#8208;Voltage Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intrinsically safe sodium&#8208;ion battery is realized by the new&#8208;type of nonflammable succinonitrile (SN)&#8208;based deep eutectic electrolyte. The deep eutectic electrolyte with a strong hydrogen bond between S&#9552;O of 1,3,2&#8208;dioxathiolane&#8208;2,2&#8208;dioxide and the &#945;&#8208;H of SN effectively improves the compatibility of SN with Lewis bases.








Abstract
Intrinsically safe sodium&#8208;ion batteries are considered as a promising candidate for large&#8208;scale energy storage systems. However, the high flammability of conventional electrolytes may pose serious safety threats and even explosions. Herein, a strategy of constructing a deep eutectic electrolyte is proposed to boost the safety and electrochemical performance of succinonitrile (SN)&#8208;based electrolyte. The strong hydrogen bond between S&#9552;O of 1,3,2&#8208;dioxathiolane&#8208;2,2&#8208;dioxide (DTD) and the &#945;&#8208;H of SN endows the enhanced safety and compatibility of SN with Lewis bases. Meanwhile, the DTD participates in the inner Na+ sheath and weakens the coordination number of SN. The unique solvation configuration promotes the formation of robust gradient inorganic&#8208;rich electrode&#8211;electrolyte interphase, and merits stable cycling of half&#8208;cells in a wide temperature range, with a capacity retention of 82.8% after 800 cycles (25&#160;&#176;C) and 86.3% after 100 cycles (60&#160;&#176;C). Correspondingly, the full cells deliver tremendous improvement in cycling stability and rate performance.

         <title>Electron Spectroscopy and Microscopy: A Window into the Surface Electronic Properties of Polycrystalline Metal Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The perspective presents an overview of the array of information that can be gleaned from the characterization of single crystals of metal halide perovskites using electron spectroscopic techniques. Building on this information, the perspective then discusses the challenges that need to be addressed in order to extend these versatile techniques to include the highly heterogeneous polycrystalline perovskite thin films.








Abstract
In the past years, an increasing number of experimental techniques have emerged to address the need to unveil the chemical, structural, and electronic properties of perovskite thin films with high vertical and lateral spatial resolutions. One of these is angle&#8208;resolved photoemission electron spectroscopy which can provide direct access to the electronic band structure of perovskites, with the aim of overcoming elusive and controversial information due to the complex data interpretation of purely optical spectroscopic techniques. This perspective looks at the information that can be gleaned from the direct measurement of the electronic band structure of single crystal perovskites and the challenges that remain to be&#160;overcame to extend this technique to heterogeneous polycrystalline metal halide perovskites.

         <title>Tailoring the Coordination Micro&#8208;Environment in Nanotraps for Efficient Platinum/Palladium Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The precise tailoring of the coordination micro&#8208;environment enables the creation of nanotraps specifically targeting platinum, facilitating the separation of binary platinum group metals (platinum/palladium). This advancement allows for the sequential and convenient acquisition of pure palladium outflow from a binary mixture of platinum and palladium via breakthrough experiments.








Abstract
Recovering platinum group metals from secondary resources is crucial to meet the growing demand for high&#8208;tech applications. Various techniques are explored, and adsorption using porous materials has emerged as a promising technology due to its efficient performance and environmental beingness. However, the challenge lies in effectively recovering and separating individual platinum group metals (PGMs) given their similar chemical properties. Herein, a breakthrough approach is presented by sophisticatedly tailoring the coordination micro&#8208;environment in a series of aminopyridine&#8208;based porous organic polymers, which enables the creation of platinum&#8208;specific nanotraps for efficient separation of binary PGMs (platinum/palladium). The newly synthesized POP&#8208;o2NH2&#8208;Py demonstrates record uptakes and selectivity toward platinum over palladium, with the amino groups adjacent to the pyridine moieties being vital in improving platinum binding performance. Further breakthrough experiments underline its remarkable ability to separate platinum and palladium. Spectroscopic analysis reveals that POP&#8208;o2NH2&#8208;Py offers a more favorable coordination fashion to platinum ions compared to palladium ions owing to the greater interaction between N and Pt4+ and stronger intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the amino groups and four coordinating chlorines at platinum. These findings underscore the importance of fine&#8208;tuning the coordination micro&#8208;environment of nanotraps through subtle modifications that can greatly enhance the selectivity toward the desired metal ions.

         <title>A Highly Deficient Medium&#8208;Entropy Perovskite Ceramic for Electromagnetic Interference Shielding under Harsh Environment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly deficient medium&#8208;entropy perovskite ceramic has developed as an efficient electromagnetic interference&#160;shielding material in harsh environment. The high concentration of Ti&#8208;O vacancy clusters formed under the synergistic effect of aliovalent substitution and entropy effect enables the material to serve as an bifunctional shielding material for electromagnetic wave and heat.








Abstract
Materials that can provide reliable electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding in highly oxidative atmosphere at elevated temperature are indispensable in the fast&#8208;developing aerospace field. However, most of conductor&#8208;type EMI shielding materials such as metals can hardly withstand the high&#8208;temperature oxidation, while the conventional dielectric&#8208;type materials cannot offer sufficient shielding efficiency in gigahertz (GHz) frequencies. Here, a highly deficient medium&#8208;entropy (ME) perovskite ceramic as an efficient EMI shielding material in harsh environment, is demonstrated. The synergistic effect of entropy stabilization and aliovalent substitution on A&#8208;site generate abnormally high concentration of Ti and O vacancies that are stable under high&#8208;temperature oxidation. Due to the clustering of vacancies, the highly deficient perovskite ceramic exhibits giant complex permittivity and polarization loss in GHz, leading to the specific EMI shielding effectiveness above 30&#160;dB/mm in X&#8208;band even after 100 h of annealing at 1000&#160;&#176;C in air. Along with the low thermal conductivity, the aliovalent ME perovskite can serve as a bifunctional shielding material for applications in aircraft engines and reusable rockets.

         <title>Triboelectric Basalt Textiles Efficiently Operating within an Ultrawide Temperature Range</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a thermally stabilized triboelectric basalt textile capable of operating in an ultra&#8208;wide temperature range of &#8722;196&#160;&#176;C to 520&#160;&#176;C. Applications of wearable extreme temperature alarms and self&#8208;powered temperature recognition are demonstrated under extreme cold and hot environments, showing their possible use in high and low latitudes, high altitudes, deserts, and even space settings.








Abstract
With the continuous upsurge in demand for wearable energy, nanogenerators are increasingly required to operate under extreme environmental conditions. Even though they are at the cutting edge of technology, nanogenerators have difficulty producing high&#8208;quality electrical output at very extreme temperatures. Here, a triboelectric basalt textile (TBT) with an ultrawide operational temperature range (from &#8722;196 to 520&#160;&#176;C) is created employing basalt material as the main body. The output power density of the TBT, in contrast to most conventional nanogenerators, would counterintuitively rise by 2.3 times to 740.6&#160;mW m&#8722;2 after heating to 100&#160;&#176;C because the high temperature will enhance the material's interface polarization and electronic kinetic energy. The TBT retains &#8776;55% of its initial electrical output even after heating in the flame of an alcohol lamp (520&#160;&#176;C). Surprisingly, the TBTs output voltage may retain over 85% of its initial value even after submerging in liquid nitrogen. The TBTs exceptional resistance to heat and cold indicates its possible use in high and low latitudes, high altitudes, deserts, and even space settings.

         <title>Double&#8208;Layered Hollow Mesoporous Cuprous Oxide Nanoparticles for Double Drug Sequential Therapy of Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To overcome the resistance of traditional tumor therapies resulting from cancer stem cells (CSCs), a strategy of double drug sequential therapy, i.e., one drug for differentiation therapy of CSCs and another drug for subsequent traditional therapy of non&#8208;CSCs, was proposed&#160;and then realized based on double&#8208;layered hollow mesoporous cuprous oxide nanoparticles in this study.








Abstract
Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are one of the determinants of tumor heterogeneity and are characterized by self&#8208;renewal, high tumorigenicity, invasiveness, and resistance to various therapies. To overcome the resistance of traditional tumor therapies resulting from CSCs, a strategy of double drug sequential therapy (DDST) for CSC&#8208;enriched tumors is proposed in this study and is realized utilizing the developed double&#8208;layered hollow mesoporous cuprous oxide nanoparticles (DL&#8208;HMCONs). The high drug&#8208;loading contents of camptothecin (CPT) and all&#8208;trans retinoic acid (ATRA) demonstrate that the DL&#8208;HMCON can be used as a generic drug delivery system. ATRA and CPT can be sequentially loaded in and released from CPT3@ATRA3@DL&#8208;HMCON@HA. The DDST mechanisms of CPT3@ATRA3@DL&#8208;HMCON@HA for CSC&#8208;containing tumors are demonstrated as follows: 1) the first release of ATRA from the outer layer induces differentiation from CSCs with high drug resistance to non&#8208;CSCs with low drug resistance; 2) the second release of CPT from the inner layer causes apoptosis of non&#8208;CSCs; and 3) the third release of Cu+ from DL&#8208;HMCON itself triggers the Fenton&#8208;like reaction and glutathione depletion, resulting in ferroptosis of non&#8208;CSCs. This CPT3@ATRA3@DL&#8208;HMCON@HA is verified to possess high DDST efficacy for CSC&#8208;enriched tumors with high biosafety.

         <dc:description>
This novel &#8220;Twistron energy cell harvester&#8221; (TECH), consisting of coiled carbon nanotube yarn, produces electrical energy from mechanical contraction. The TECH device is applied to an artificial heartbeat system and in a second step to a porcine heart and is able continuously generated electrical energy from cardiac contraction. This energy can potentially be used for medical implants.








Abstract
Reliability of power supply for current implantable electronic devices is a critical issue for longevity and for reducing the risk of device failure. Energy harvesting is an emerging technology, representing a strategy for establishing autonomous power supply by utilizing biomechanical movements in human body. Here, a novel &#8220;Twistron energy cell harvester&#8221; (TECH), consisting of coiled carbon nanotube yarn that converts mechanical energy of the beating heart into electrical energy, is presented. The performance of TECH is evaluated in an in vitro artificial heartbeat system which simulates the deformation pattern of the cardiac surface, reaching a maximum peak power of 1.42&#160;W kg&#8722;1 and average power of 0.39&#160;W kg&#8722;1 at 60 beats per minute. In vivo implantation of TECH onto the left ventricular surface in a porcine model continuously generates electrical energy from cardiac contraction. The generated electrical energy is used for direct pacing of the heart as documented by extensive electrophysiology mapping. Implanted modified carbon nanotubes are applicable as a source for harvesting biomechanical energy from cardiac motion for power supply or cardiac pacing.

         <title>Challenges and Breakthroughs in Enhancing Temperature Tolerance of Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) demonstrate distinct advantages over lithium&#8208;ion batteries across various applications when considering a wide temperature range. Herein, this review delves into the research on wide&#8208;temperature SIBs, offering a comprehensive analysis of how temperature affects the parameters governing battery performance. Furthermore, it summarizes the modification strategies for electrodes and electrolytes aimed at enhancing battery performance under extreme temperature conditions.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;based batteries (LBBs) have been highly researched and recognized as a mature electrochemical energy storage (EES) system in recent years. However, their stability and effectiveness are primarily confined to room temperature conditions. At temperatures significantly below 0&#160;&#176;C or above 60&#160;&#176;C, LBBs experience substantial performance degradation. Under such challenging extreme contexts, sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) emerge as a promising complementary technology, distinguished by their fast dynamics at low&#8208;temperature regions and superior safety under elevated temperatures. Notably, developing SIBs suitable for wide&#8208;temperature usage still presents significant challenges, particularly for specific applications such as electric vehicles, renewable energy storage, and deep&#8208;space/polar explorations, which requires a thorough understanding of how SIBs perform under different temperature conditions. By reviewing the development of wide&#8208;temperature SIBs, the influence of temperature on the parameters related to battery performance, such as reaction constant, charge transfer resistance, etc., is systematically and comprehensively analyzed. The review emphasizes challenges encountered by SIBs in both low and high temperatures while exploring recent advancements in SIB materials, specifically focusing on strategies to enhance battery performance across diverse temperature ranges. Overall, insights gained from these studies will drive the development of SIBs that can handle the challenges posed by diverse and harsh climates.

         <title>5.1&#160;&#181;m Ion&#8208;Regulated Rigid Quasi&#8208;Solid Electrolyte Constructed by Bridging Fast Li&#8208;Ion Transfer Channels for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

A 5.1&#160;&#181;m rigid quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte layer&#160;constructed by tough Kevlar nanofibers bridge with metal&#8208;organic framework channels&#160;and in&#8208;situ polymerized deep&#8208;eutectic&#8208;solvent as the ion&#8208;transport carrier is designed on the cathode. This quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte with nano&#8208;network&#8208;topology&#160;has considerable Li+ transport properties, low ionic diffusion activation energy, and high modulus, which guarantees the high cyclic stability of lithium&#8208;metal batteries.








Abstract
An ultra&#8208;thin quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte (QSE) with dendrite&#8208;inhibiting properties is a requirement for achieving high energy density quasi&#8208;solid lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Here, a 5.1&#160;&#181;m rigid QSE layer is directly designed on the cathode, in which Kevlar (poly(p&#8208;phenylene terephthalate)) nanofibers (KANFs) with negatively charged groups bridging metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) particles are served as a rigid skeleton, and non&#8208;flammable deep eutectic solvent is selected to be encapsulated into the MOF channels, combined with in situ polymerization to complete safe electrolyte system with high rigidness and stability. The QSE with&#160;constructed topological network demonstrates high rigidity (5.4&#160;GPa), high ionic conductivity (0.73 mS cm&#8722;1 at room temperature), good ion&#8208;regulated properties, and improved structural stability, contributing to homogenized Li&#8208;ion flux, excellent dendrite suppression, and prolonged cyclic performance for LMB. Additionally, ion regulation influences the Li deposition behavior, exhibiting a uniform morphology on the Li&#8208;metal surface after cycling. According to density&#8208;functional theory, KANFs bridging MOFs as hosts play a vital function in the free&#8208;state and fast diffusion dynamics of Li&#8208;ions. This work provides an effective strategy for constructing ultrathin robust electrolytes with a novel ionic conduction mode.

         <title>Less is More: Asymmetric D&#8211;A Type Agent to Achieve Dynamic Self&#8208;Assembled Nanoaggregates for Long&#8208;Acting Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic self&#8208;assembled nanoaggregates that can undergo &#8220;sphere&#8208;to&#8208;rod&#8221; process are constructed here by an asymmetric D&#8211;A type TIBT. The nanoaggregates exhibit high tumor&#8208;targeting, prolonged retention, and favored metabolism by a single effort, finally contributing to long&#8208;acting photodynamic therapy treatment with low dose but high inhibition rate to tumors in vivo.








Abstract
To enhance the phototheranostic performance, agents with high reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, good tumor&#8208;targeting ability, and prolonged retention are urgently needed. However, symmetric donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) type agents usually produce spherical nanoaggregates, leading to good tumor targeting but inferior retention. Rod&#8208;like nanoaggregates are desired to extend their retention in tumors; however, this remains a challenge. In particular, agents with dynamically changeable shapes that integrate merits of different morphologies are seldomly reported. Therefore, self&#8208;assembled organic nanoaggregates with smart shape tunability are designed here using an asymmetric D&#8211;A type TIBT. The photoluminescence quantum yield in solids is up to 52.24% for TIBT. TIBT also exhibits high ROS generation in corresponding nanoaggregates (TIBT&#8208;NCs). Moreover, dynamic self&#8208;assembly in shape changing from nanospheres to nanorods occurrs in TIBT&#8208;NCs, contributing to the enhancement of ROS quantum yield from 0.55 to 0.72. In addition, dynamic self&#8208;assembly can be observed for both in vitro and in vivo, conferring TIBT&#8208;NCs with strong tumor targeting and prolonged retention. Finally, efficient photodynamic therapy to inhibit tumor growth is achieved in TIBT&#8208;NCs, with an inhibition rate of 90%. This work demonstrates that asymmetric D&#8211;A type agents can play significant roles in forming self&#8208;assembled organic nanoaggregates, thus showing great potential in long&#8208;acting cancer therapy.

         <title>Co&#8208;Assembled Nanoparticles toward Multi&#8208;Target Combinational Therapy of Alzheimer's Disease by Making Full Use of Molecular Recognition and Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein a novel supramolecular integration strategy based on molecular recognition and self&#8208;assembly is proposed for the multi&#8208;target combinational therapy of Alzheimer's disease, and its feasibility and tunability are validated taking the combination of &#946;&#8208;amyloid fibrillization and oxidative stress as the representative in this work, which provides a convenient platform for constructing such multifunctional integrated system toward complex disease treatment.








Abstract
The complex pathologies in Alzheimer's disease (AD) severely limit the effectiveness of single&#8208;target pharmic interventions, thus necessitating multi&#8208;pronged therapeutic strategies. While flexibility is essentially demanded in constructing such multi&#8208;target systems, for achieving optimal synergies and also accommodating the inherent heterogeneity within AD. Utilizing the dynamic reversibility of supramolecular strategy for conferring sufficient tunability in component substitution and proportion adjustment, amphiphilic calixarenes are poised to be a privileged molecular tool for facilely achieving function integration. Herein, taking &#946;&#8208;amyloid (A&#946;) fibrillation and oxidative stress as model combination pattern, a supramolecular multifunctional integration is proposed by co&#8208;assembling guanidinium&#8208;modified calixarene with ascorbyl palmitate and loading dipotassium phytate within calixarene cavity. Serial pivotal events can be simultaneously addressed by this versatile system, including 1) inhibition of A&#946; production and aggregation, 2) disintegration of A&#946; fibrils, 3) acceleration of A&#946; metabolic clearance, and 4) regulation of oxidative stress, which is verified to significantly ameliorate the cognitive impairment of 5&#215;FAD mice, with reduced A&#946; plaque content, neuroinflammation, and neuronal apoptosis. Confronted with the extremely intricate clinical realities of AD, the strategy presented here exhibits ample adaptability for necessary alterations on combinations, thereby may immensely expedite the advancement of AD combinational therapy through providing an exceptionally convenient platform.

         <title>Multilaminate Energy Storage Films from Entropy&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Assembled Supramolecular Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Entropy&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly empowers the creation of highly ordered lamellar organic&#8211;inorganic supramolecular nanocomposite films, which display remarkably enhanced performance compared to unstructured composites when employed for electrostatic energy storage. This work highlights the central role of oriented nanoparticle&#8208;rich lamella in manipulating dielectric properties and electrostatic energy storage performance, offering a design concept for exploiting high&#8208;energy&#8208;density polymer nanocomposite films.








Abstract
Composite materials comprising polymers and inorganic nanoparticles (NPs) are promising for energy storage applications, though challenges in controlling NP dispersion often result in performance bottlenecks. Realizing nanocomposites with controlled NP locations and distributions within polymer microdomains is highly desirable for improving energy storage capabilities but is a persistent challenge, impeding the in&#8208;depth understanding of the structure&#8211;performance relationship. In this study, a facile entropy&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly approach is employed to fabricate block copolymer&#8208;based supramolecular nanocomposite films with highly ordered lamellar structures, which are then used in electrostatic film capacitors. The oriented interfacial barriers and well&#8208;distributed inorganic NPs within the self&#8208;assembled multilaminate nanocomposites effectively suppress leakage current and mitigate the risk of breakdown, showing superior dielectric strength compared to their disordered counterparts. Consequently, the lamellar nanocomposite films with optimized composition exhibit high energy efficiency (&gt;90% at 650&#160;MV&#160;m&#8722;1), along with remarkable energy density and power density. Moreover, finite element simulations and statistical modeling have provided theoretical insights into the impact of the lamellar structure on electrical conduction, electric field distribution, and electrical tree propagation. This work marks a significant advancement in the design of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrids for energy storage, establishing a well&#8208;defined correlation between microstructure and performance.

         <title>Functional Amyloids: The Biomaterials of Tomorrow?</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functional amyloid from bacteria, particularly CsgA and FapC, are emerging as promising new biomaterials with applications within areas as diverse as gastrointestinal colonization, tissue engineering, water purification, CO2 fixation, biosensing, and more recently biocatalysis. This is thanks to their high stability, efficient and controllable formation, easy and scalable availability and ready engineering opportunities.








Abstract
Functional amyloid (FAs), particularly the bacterial proteins CsgA and FapC, have many useful properties as biomaterials: high stability, efficient, and controllable formation of a single type of amyloid, easy availability as extracellular material in bacterial biofilm and flexible engineering to introduce new properties. CsgA in particular has already demonstrated its worth in hydrogels for stable gastrointestinal colonization and regenerative tissue engineering, cell&#8208;specific drug release, water&#8208;purification filters, and different biosensors. It also holds promise as catalytic amyloid; existing weak and unspecific activity can undoubtedly be improved by targeted engineering and benefit from the repetitive display of active sites on a surface. Unfortunately, FapC remains largely unexplored and no application is described so far. Since FapC shares many common features with CsgA, this opens the window to its development as a functional scaffold. The multiple imperfect repeats in CsgA and FapC form a platform to introduce novel properties, e.g., in connecting linkers of variable lengths. While exploitation of this potential is still at an early stage, particularly for FapC, a thorough understanding of their molecular properties will pave the way for multifunctional fibrils which can contribute toward solving many different societal challenges, ranging from CO2 fixation to hydrolysis of plastic nanoparticles.

         <title>Responsively Degradable Nanoarmor&#8208;Assisted Super Resistance and Stable Colonization of Probiotics for Enhanced Inflammation&#8208;Targeted Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A superior armored probiotic (EcN@PC&#8211;Fe/HA) with an inflammation&#8208;targeting capacity is developed to enhance the efficacy and timely action of bacterial therapy against inflammatory bowel disease. EcN@PC&#8211;Fe/HA shows excellent prophylactic efficacy and therapeutic performance against dextran sulfate sodium&#8208;induced colitis including alleviating inflammation, restoring intestinal barrier function, and reshaping the dysbiosis of intestinal bacteria.








Abstract
Manipulation of the gut microbiota using oral microecological preparations has shown great promise in treating various inflammatory disorders. However, delivering these preparations while maintaining their disease&#8208;site specificity, stability, and therapeutic efficacy is highly challenging due to the dynamic changes associated with pathological microenvironments in the gastrointestinal tract. Herein, a superior armored probiotic with an inflammation&#8208;targeting capacity is developed to enhance the efficacy and timely action of bacterial therapy against inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The coating strategy exhibits suitability for diverse probiotic strains and has negligible influence on bacterial viability. This study demonstrates that these armored probiotics have ultraresistance to extreme intraluminal conditions and stable mucoadhesive capacity. Notably, the HA&#8208;functionalized nanoarmor equips the probiotics with inflamed&#8208;site targetability through multiple interactions, thus enhancing their efficacy in IBD therapy. Moreover, timely &#8220;awakening&#8221; of ingested probiotics through the responsive transferrin&#8208;directed degradation of the nanoarmor at the site of inflammation is highly beneficial for bacterial therapy, which requires the bacterial cells to be fully functional. Given its easy preparation and favorable biocompatibility, the developed single&#8208;cell coating approach provides an effective strategy for the advanced delivery of probiotics for biomedical applications at the cellular level.

         <title>Intense Left&#8208;handed Circularly Polarized Luminescence in Chiral Nematic Hydroxypropyl Cellulose Composite Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) derived luminescent materials exhibit intense and multicolored left&#8208;handed circularly polarized light (CPL), opening the way for the practical application of nanocellulosic chirality in durable multimode anticounterfeiting and enantioselective photopolymerization. The versatility, high glum, and large &#934; of this system will promote its applications in chiral sensing, chiroptical devices, 3D display technologies, and CPL chiral imaging.








Abstract
Integrating optically active components into chiral photonic cellulose to fabricate circularly polarized luminescent materials has transformative potential in disease detection, asymmetric reactions, and anticounterfeiting techniques. However, the lack of cellulose&#8208;based left&#8208;handed circularly polarized light (L&#8208;CPL) emissions hampers the progress of these chiral functionalizations. Here, this work proposes an unprecedented strategy: incorporating a chiral nematic organization of hydroxypropyl cellulose with robust aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens to generate intense L&#8208;CPL emission. By utilizing N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide as a good solvent for fluorescent components and cellulose matrices, this work produces a right&#8208;handed chiral nematic structure film with a uniform appearance in reflective and fluorescent states. Remarkably, this system integrates a high asymmetric factor (0.51) and an impressive emission quantum yield (55.8%) into one fascinating composite. More meaningfully, this approach is versatile, allowing for the incorporation of luminogen derivatives emitting multicolored L&#8208;CPL. These chiral fluorescent films possess exceptional mechanical flexibility (toughness up to 0.9 MJ m&#8722;3) and structural stability even under harsh environmental exposures, making them promising for the fabrication of various products. Additionally, these films can be cast on the fabrics to reveal multilevel and durable anticounterfeiting capabilities or used as a chiral light source to induce enantioselective photopolymerization, thereby offering significant potential for diverse practical applications.

         <title>Solid Additive Dual&#8208;Regulates Spectral Response Enabling High&#8208;Performance Semitransparent Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel solid additive is proposed to dual&#8208;regulate donor/acceptor diffusion and molecular stacking, thus tuning the spectral response of resulting semi&#8208;transparent devices. The weakened visible light absorption intensity and extended utilization of NIR light enable ST&#8208;OSCs to simultaneously possess high average visible transmittance and high photocurrent, which results in a record&#8208;breaking light utilization efficiency in the AVT range of 40&#8211;50%.








Abstract
Semi&#8208;transparent organic solar cells (ST&#8208;OSCs) possess significant potential for applications in vehicles and buildings due to their distinctive visual transparency. Conventional device engineering strategies are typically used to optimize photon selection and utilization at the expense of power conversion efficiency (PCE); moreover, the fixed spectral utilization range always imposes an unsatisfactory upper limit to its light utilization efficiency (LUE).

&lt;p&gt;A novel solid additive is proposed to dual-regulate donor/acceptor diffusion and molecular stacking, thus tuning the spectral response of resulting semi-transparent devices. The weakened visible light absorption intensity and extended utilization of NIR light enable ST-OSCs to simultaneously possess high average visible transmittance and high photocurrent, which results in a record-breaking light utilization efficiency in the AVT range of 40&#8211;50%.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Semi-transparent organic solar cells (ST-OSCs) possess significant potential for applications in vehicles and buildings due to their distinctive visual transparency. Conventional device engineering strategies are typically used to optimize photon selection and utilization at the expense of power conversion efficiency (PCE); moreover, the fixed spectral utilization range always imposes an unsatisfactory upper limit to its light utilization efficiency (LUE). Herein, a novel solid additive named&#160;1,3-diphenoxybenzene (DB) is employed to dual-regulate donor/acceptor molecular aggregation and crystallinity, which effectively broadens the spectral response of ST-OSCs&#160;in near-infrared region. Besides, more visible light is allowed to pass through the devices, which enables ST-OSCs to possess satisfactory photocurrent and high average visible transmittance (AVT) simultaneously. Consequently, the optimal ST-OSC based on PP2+DB/BTP-eC9+DB achieves a superior LUE of 4.77%, representing the highest value within AVT range of 40&#8211;50%, which also correlates with the formation of multi-scale phase-separated morphology. Such results indicate that the ST-OSCs can simultaneously meet the requirements for minimum commercial efficiency and plant photosynthesis when integrated with the roofs of agricultural greenhouses. This work emphasizes the significance of additives to tune the spectral response in ST-OSCs, and charts the way for organic photovoltaics in economically sustainable agricultural development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering a Dynamic Solvent&#8208;Phobic Liquid Electrolyte Interphase for Long&#8208;Life Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solvent&#8208;phobic dynamic liquid electrolyte interphase (DLEI) on a Li metal surface (Li&#8211;PFbTHF) is developed to improve the cycling performance of practical Li metal batteries in carbonate electrolytes. Evidence from advanced techniques indicated that the C&#8211;F&#8208;rich groups of PFbTHF induce LiF/Li3PO4&#8208;rich SEI. Consequently, the LiFePO4||Li&#8211;PFbTHF cells exhibit long&#8208;term cycling stability and a high rate capacity.








Abstract
The heterogeneity, species diversity, and poor mechanical stability of solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs) in conventional carbonate electrolytes result in the irreversible exhaustion of lithium (Li) and electrolytes during cycling, hindering the practical applications of Li metal batteries (LMBs). Herein, this work proposes a solvent&#8208;phobic dynamic liquid electrolyte interphase (DLEI) on a Li metal (Li&#8211;PFbTHF (perfluoro&#8208;butyltetrahydrofuran)) surface that selectively transports salt and induces salt&#8208;derived SEI formation. The solvent&#8208;phobic DLEI with C&#8211;F&#8208;rich groups dramatically reduces the side reactions between Li, carbonate solvents, and humid air, forming a LiF/Li3PO4&#8208;rich SEI. In situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and Ab&#8208;initio molecular dynamics demonstrate that DLEI effectively stabilizes the interface between Li metal and the carbonate electrolyte. Specifically, the LiFePO4||Li&#8211;PFbTHF cells deliver 80.4% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 1.0 C, excellent rate capacity (108.2 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5.0 C), and 90.2% capacity retention after 550 cycles at 1.0 C in full&#8208;cells (negative/positive (N/P) ratio of 8) with high LiFePO4 loadings (15.6&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) in carbonate electrolyte. In addition, the 0.55 Ah pouch cell of 252.0&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 delivers stable cycling. Hence, this study provides an effective strategy for controlling salt&#8208;derived SEI to improve the cycling performances of carbonate&#8208;based LMBs.

         <title>Interlayer Biatomic Pair Bridging the van der Waals Gap for 100% Activation of 2D Layered Material</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to achieve 100% activation is reported of atoms on the basal plane of 2D layered materials by constructing an interlayer biatomic bridge. New gap states at the Fermi level are introduced and interlayer conductivity is enhanced in this catalyst. Exposed basal plane atoms are optimized to a state favorable for adsorbing catalytic intermediates.








Abstract
2D layered materials are regarded as prospective catalyst candidates due to their advantageous atomic exposure ratio. Nevertheless, the predominant population of atoms residing on the basal plane with saturated coordination, exhibit inert behavior, while a mere fraction of atoms located at the periphery display reactivity. Here, a novel approach is reported to attain complete atom activation in 2D layered materials through the construction of an interlayer biatomic pair bridge. The atoms in question have been strategically optimized to achieve a highly favorable state for the adsorption of intermediates. This optimization results from the introduction of new gap states around the Fermi level. Moreover, the presence of the interlayer bridge facilitates the electron transfer across the van der Waals gap, thereby enhancing the reaction kinetics. The hydrogen evolution reaction exhibits an impressive ultrahigh current density of 2000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 397&#160;mV, surpassing the pristine MoS2 by approximately two orders of magnitude (26&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 397&#160;mV). This study provides new insights for enhancing the efficacy of 2D layered catalysts.

         <title>Solid Electrolyte Bimodal Grain Structures for Improved Cycling Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To overcome the low critical current density obstacle facing Li7La3Zr2O12 solid&#8208;state electrolytes, a &#8220;detour and buffer&#8221; strategy is validated by obtaining a coarse/fine bimodal grain microstructure. By tuning the ratio and spatial distribution of coarse and fine grains, the optimized bimodal microstructure allows cycling for over 2000&#160;h as the current density is ramped from 1.0 up to 2.0 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
The application of solid&#8208;state electrolytes in Li batteries is hampered by the occurrence of Li&#8208;dendrite&#8208;caused short circuits. To avoid cell failure, the electrolytes can only be stressed with rather low current densities, severely restricting their performance. As grain size and pore distributions significantly affect dendrite growth in ceramic electrolytes such as Li7La3Zr2O12 and its variants; here, a &#8220;detour and buffer&#8221; strategy to bring the superiority of both coarse and fine grains into play, is proposed. To validate the mechanism, a coarse/fine bimodal grain microstructure is obtained by seeding unpulverized large particles in the green body. The rearrangement of coarse grains and fine pores is fine&#8208;tuned by changing the ratio of pulverized and unpulverized powders. The optimized bimodal microstructure, obtained when the two powders are equally mixed, allows, without extra interface decoration, cycling for over 2000&#160;h as the current density is increased from 1.0 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2, and gradually, up to 2.0 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2. The &#8220;detour and buffer&#8221; effects are confirmed from postmortem analysis. The complex grain boundaries formed by fine grains discourage the direct infiltration of Li. Simultaneously, the coarse grains further increase the tortuosity of the Li path. This study sheds light on the microstructure optimization for the polycrystalline solid&#8208;state electrolytes.

         <title>Enabling Self&#8208;Adaptive Water&#8208;Energy&#8208;Balance of Photothermal Water Diode Evaporator: Dynamically Maximizing Energy Utilization Under the Ever&#8208;Changing Sunlight</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photothermal water diode (WD) evaporator concept by an integrated hydrophilic/hydrophobic absorber is proposed to address the critical issue of low energy utilization. Due to the unique unidirectional water transport properties induced by asymmetric wettability, the WD evaporator can bring dynamic management and self&#8208;regulation on water supply when encountering different suns, thus realizing the energy matching and utilization maximization.








Abstract
Maintaining a match between input solar energy and required energy by water supply management is key to achieving efficient interfacial solar&#8208;driven evaporation (ISDE). In practice, the solar radiation flux is constantly changing throughout the day, so keeping a dynamic water&#8208;energy&#8208;balance of ISDE is a big challenge.

&lt;p&gt;A photothermal water diode (WD) evaporator concept by an integrated hydrophilic/hydrophobic absorber is proposed to address the critical issue of low energy utilization. Due to the unique unidirectional water transport properties induced by asymmetric wettability, the WD evaporator can bring dynamic management and self-regulation on water supply when encountering different suns, thus realizing the energy matching and utilization maximization.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maintaining a match between input solar energy and required energy by water supply management is key to achieving efficient interfacial solar-driven evaporation (ISDE). In practice, the solar radiation flux is constantly changing throughout the day, so keeping a dynamic water-energy-balance of ISDE is a big challenge. Herein, a photothermal water diode (WD) evaporator concept is proposed by an integrated hydrophilic/hydrophobic Janus absorber to overcome the issue. Due to the unique unidirectional water transport properties induced by asymmetric wettability, a self-adaptive balance between photothermal energy input and water uptake is established, thus realizing the energy matching and utilization maximization. The experimental and simulation results exhibit that with the increase of sunlight intensity, the water supply speed is significantly accelerated due to the dynamic management and self-regulation on water replenishment. Therefore, an excellent evaporation rate of up to 2.14&#160;kg&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt; with a high efficiency of 93.7% under 1&#160;sun illumination is achieved. This water diode engineering with Janus wettability provides a novel strategy and extends the path for designing solar evaporation systems with diverse water supply properties, which shows great potential in different environmental conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fully Memristive Elementary Motion Detectors for a Maneuver Prediction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully memristive elementary motion detector (M&#8208;EMD) is proposed to emulate the biological vision system. Inspired by the structure and function of the biological motion&#8208;detecting neural circuit, the detector achieves agile and efficient motion detection using a simple configuration composed only of memristors. The proposed detector is applicable to a motion&#8208;detecting element for edge&#8208;level neuromorphic computing.








Abstract
Insects can efficiently perform object motion detection via a specialized neural circuit, called an elementary motion detector (EMD). In contrast, conventional machine vision systems require significant computational resources for dynamic motion processing. Here, a fully memristive EMD (M&#8208;EMD) is presented that implements the Hassenstein&#8211;Reichardt (HR) correlator, a biological model of the EMD. The M&#8208;EMD consists of a simple Wye (Y) configuration, including a static resistor, a dynamic memristor, and a Mott memristor. The resistor and dynamic memristor introduce different signal delays, enabling spatio&#8208;temporal signal integration in the subsequent Mott memristor, resulting in a direction&#8208;selective response. In addition, a neuromorphic system is developed employing the M&#8208;EMDs to predict a lane&#8208;changing maneuver by vehicles on the road. The system achieved a high accuracy (&gt; 87%) in predicting future lane&#8208;changing maneuvers on the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) dataset while reducing the computational cost by 92.9% compared to the conventional neuromorphic system without the M&#8208;EMD, suggesting its strong potential for edge&#8208;level computing.

         <title>Competing Mechanisms Determine Oxygen Redox in Doped Ni&#8211;Mn Based Layered Oxides for Na&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Beyond the well&#8208;known P2 to O2 phase transition, oxygen redox is a main bottleneck for capacity retention. Using synchrotron&#8208;based methods, it is revealed that competing mechanisms between Ni and Mg (or Li, Zn, and Cu) are critical for controlling the degree of oxygen redox in doped Ni&#8211;Mn based layered oxides in Na&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Cation doping is an effective strategy for improving the cyclability of layered oxide cathode materials through suppression of phase transitions in the high voltage region. In this study, Mg and Sc are chosen as dopants in P2&#8208;Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2, and both have found to&#160;positively impact the cycling stability, but influence the high voltage regime in different ways. Through a combination of synchrotron&#8208;based methods and theoretical calculations it is shown that it is more than just suppression of the P2 to O2 phase transition that is critical for promoting the favorable properties, and that the interplay between Ni and O activity is also a critical aspect that dictates the performance. With Mg doping, the Ni activity can be enhanced while simultaneously suppressing the O activity. This is surprising because it is in contrast to what has been reported in other Mn&#8208;based layered oxides where Mg is known to trigger oxygen redox. This contradiction is addressed by proposing a competing mechanism between Ni and Mg that impacts differences in O activity in Na0.67MgxNi0.33&#8208;xMn0.67O2 (x&#160;&lt;&#160;0&#160;&lt;&#160;0.33). These findings provide a new direction in understanding the effects of cation doping on the electrochemical behavior of layered oxides.

         <title>Physically and Chemically Stable Molybdenum&#8208;Based Composite Electrodes for p&#8211;i&#8211;n Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
As a pivotal component within solar devices, the electrode has a profound impact on the device performance. Herein, device configuration based on the physically and chemically stable molybdenum electrode is engineered to fundamentally tackle the instability factors introduced by electrodes in perovskite solar cells. A titanium seed layer is further introduced to optimize the electrode interfacial contact. 








Abstract
Metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have garnered much attention in recent years. Despite the remarkable advancements in PSCs utilizing traditional metal electrodes, challenges such as stability concerns and elevated costs have necessitated the exploration of innovative electrode designs to facilitate industrial commercialization. Herein, a physically and chemically stable molybdenum (Mo) electrode is developed to fundamentally tackle the instability factors introduced by electrodes. The combined spatially resolved element analyses and theoretical study demonstrate the high diffusion barrier of Mo ions within the device. Structural and morphology characterization also reveals the negligible plastic deformation and halide&#8208;metal reaction during aging when Mo is in contact with perovskite (PVSK). The electrode/underlayer junction is further stabilized by a thin seed layer of titanium (Ti) to improve Mo film's uniformity and adhesion. Based on a corresponding p&#8211;i&#8211;n PSCs (ITO/PTAA/PVSK/C60/SnO2/ITO/Ti/Mo), the champion sample could deliver an efficiency of 22.25%, which is among the highest value for PSCs based on Mo electrodes. Meanwhile, the device shows negligible performance decay after 2000 h operation, and retains 91% of the initial value after 1300 h at 50&#8211;60 &#176;C. In summary, the multilayer Mo electrode opens an effective avenue to all&#8208;round stable electrode design in high&#8208;performance PSCs.

Abstract
In this work, the properties of a novel electrolyte based on the combination of bio&#8208;based &#436;&#8208;valerolactone (GVL) solvent with lithium bis(oxalato)borate (LiBOB) salt and its use for lithium&#8208;ion capacitors (LICs) are presented. It is shown that the 1 m LiBOB in GVL electrolyte displays good transport properties, high thermal stability, and the ability to prevent anodic dissolution. Its impact on the performance of both battery&#8208;type and capacitive&#8208;type electrodes is evaluated. In this regard, special attention is paid to the filming properties associated with LiBOB and GVL decomposition at the electrode surfaces. To the best of the authors&#8217; knowledge, the full&#8208;cell devices assembled in this study are the first example of a fluorine&#8208;free LIC. These devices exhibit a favorable energy&#8208;to&#8208;power ratio, delivering 80&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1AM at 10&#160;000&#160;W&#160;kg&#8722;1AM along with excellent cycling stability, retaining 80% of the initial capacitance after 25&#160;000 cycles. Furthermore, post&#8208;mortem analysis of the LIC electrodes is conducted to gain deeper insights into the degradation mechanisms within the device.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, the properties of a novel electrolyte based on the combination of bio-based &#436;-valerolactone (GVL) solvent with lithium &lt;i&gt;bis&lt;/i&gt;(oxalato)borate (LiBOB) salt and its use for lithium-ion capacitors (LICs) are presented. It is shown that the 1 &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; LiBOB in GVL electrolyte displays good transport properties, high thermal stability, and the ability to prevent anodic dissolution. Its impact on the performance of both battery-type and capacitive-type electrodes is evaluated. In this regard, special attention is paid to the filming properties associated with LiBOB and GVL decomposition at the electrode surfaces. To the best of the authors&#8217; knowledge, the full-cell devices assembled in this study are the first example of a fluorine-free LIC. These devices exhibit a favorable energy-to-power ratio, delivering 80&#160;Wh&#160;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;AM&lt;/sub&gt; at 10&#160;000&#160;W&#160;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;AM&lt;/sub&gt; along with excellent cycling stability, retaining 80% of the initial capacitance after 25&#160;000 cycles. Furthermore, post-mortem analysis of the LIC electrodes is conducted to gain deeper insights into the degradation mechanisms within the device.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient and Stable Multicolor Emissions of the Coumarin&#8208;Modified Cs3LnCl6 Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Nanocrystals and LED Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing coumarin molecule, various Cs3LnCl6 perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) emitting light across the visible to near&#8208;infrared spectrum are systemically prepared. The Cs3EuCl6 NC can achieve an impressive photoluminescence quantum yield of 92.4% with pure red emission and an exceptional energy transfer efficiency of nearly 93.2%. Furthermore, the lanthanide&#8208;based electroluminescent devices in red, green, and blue are successfully fabricated.








Abstract
Lanthanide&#8208;based lead&#8208;free perovskite materials hold great promise for the development of high&#8208;resolution full&#8208;color displays in the future. Here, various Cs3LnCl6 perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) emitting light across the visible to near&#8208;infrared spectrum with remarkably high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) are systemically prepared. Especially, by introducing multifunctional coumarin small molecules into Cs3EuCl6 NCs as an intermediate state, Cs3EuCl6 NCs can achieve an impressive PLQY of 92.4% with pure red emission and an exceptional energy transfer efficiency of nearly 93.2%. Furthermore, the lanthanide&#8208;based electroluminescent devices in red, green, and blue are successfully fabricated. Among them, the Cs3EuCl6&#8208;NC&#8208;based red light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) demonstrates a FWHM of 18&#160;nm at 617&#160;nm, an external quantum efficiency up to 5.17%, and a maximum brightness of 2373&#160;cd m&#8722;2, which is the most excellent reported for lead&#8208;free narrowband (within 20&#160;nm) emission devices. Notably, these devices exhibit an operating half&#8208;life of 440 h at a brightness level of 100&#160;cd m&#8722;2, surpassing the performance of most reported lead&#8208;free perovskite LEDs (PLEDs). This work opens up exciting possibilities for the future commercialization of lanthanide&#8208;based PLEDs in the display industry, paving the way for more vibrant, energy&#8208;efficient, and long&#8208;lasting display technologies.

         <title>On&#8208;Command Disassembly of Microrobotic Superstructures for Transport and Delivery of Magnetic Micromachines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A magnetically driven microrobotic superstructure is designed for navigation in microscale environments. The superstructure consists of microhelices interlocked with a gelatin composite chassis containing iron oxide nanoparticles. The helices serve as the motion component, while the nanoparticles enable the gelatin to dissolve via magnetic hyperthermia. Upon dissolution, the helices are released and navigate through smaller conduits using a rotating field.








Abstract
Magnetic microrobots have been developed for navigating microscale environments by means of remote magnetic fields. However, limited propulsion speeds at small scales remain an issue in the maneuverability of these devices as magnetic force and torque are proportional to their magnetic volume. Here, a microrobotic superstructure is proposed, which, as analogous to a supramolecular system, consists of two or more microrobotic units that are interconnected and organized through a physical (transient) component (a polymeric frame or a thread). The superstructures consist of microfabricated magnetic helical micromachines interlocked by a magnetic gelatin nanocomposite containing iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs). While the microhelices enable the motion of the superstructure, the IONPs serve as heating transducers for dissolving the gelatin chassis via magnetic hyperthermia. In a practical demonstration, the superstructure's motion with a gradient magnetic field in a large channel, the disassembly of the superstructure and release of the helical micromachines by a high&#8208;frequency alternating magnetic field, and the corkscrew locomotion of the released helices through a small channel via a rotating magnetic field, is showcased. This adaptable microrobotic superstructure reacts to different magnetic inputs, which can be used to perform complex delivery procedures within intricate regions of the human body.

         <title>Ultrathin Magnesium&#8208;Based Coating as an Efficient Oxygen Barrier for Superconducting Circuit Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a combined experimental and computational study, it is demonstrated that an ultrathin Mg capping layer effectively suppresses the oxidation of tantalum (Ta), a promising material for superconducting qubits. With Mg acting as an oxygen barrier and getter, the superconducting properties of the underlaying Ta thin films are improved, exhibiting sharper transition to the Meissner state at higher critical temperature.








Abstract
Scaling up superconducting quantum circuits based on transmon qubits necessitates substantial enhancements in qubit coherence time. Over recent years, tantalum (Ta) has emerged as a promising candidate for transmon qubits, surpassing conventional counterparts in terms of coherence time. However, amorphous surface Ta oxide layer may introduce dielectric loss, ultimately placing a limit on the coherence time. In this study, a novel approach for suppressing the formation of tantalum oxide using an ultrathin magnesium (Mg) capping layer is presented. Synchrotron&#8208;based X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies demonstrate that oxide is confined to an extremely thin region directly beneath the Mg/Ta interface. Additionally, it is demonstrated that the superconducting properties of thin Ta films are improved following the Mg capping, exhibiting sharper and higher&#8208;temperature transitions to superconductive and magnetically ordered states. Moreover, an atomic&#8208;scale mechanistic understanding of the role of the capping layer in protecting Ta from oxidation is established based on computational modeling. This work provides valuable insights into the formation mechanism and functionality of surface tantalum oxide, as well as a new materials design principle with the potential to reduce dielectric loss in superconducting quantum materials. Ultimately, the findings pave the way for the realization of large&#8208;scale, high&#8208;performance quantum computing systems.

         <title>Ultrasound Imaging of Tumor Vascular CD93 with MMRN2 Modified Microbubbles for Immune Microenvironment Prediction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tumor endothelial expression of CD93 inversely correlates with the tumor vasculature normalization and immune activation. Ultrasound molecular imaging CD93 using targeted MBs armed with MMRN2, an endogenous ligand of CD93, provides a noninvasive and accurate strategy to evaluate the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) and predict immunotherapy response.








Abstract
Vascular microenvironment is found to be closely related to immunotherapy efficacy. Identification and ultrasound imaging of the unique vascular characteristics, able to predict immune microenvironment, is important for immunotherapy decision&#8208;making. Herein, it is proved that high CD93 expression in the tumor vessels is closely related to the poor immune response of prostate cancer. For ultrasound molecular imaging of CD93, CD93&#8208;targeted microbubbles (MBs) consist a gaseous core and the MMRN2 (Multimerin&#8208;2) containing cell membrane (CM) /lipid hybrid membrane is then synthesized. In vitro and in vivo assays demonstrate that these MBs can recognize CD93 efficiently and then accumulate within tumor regions highly expressing CD93. Contrast&#8208;enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) imaging with CD93&#8208;targeted MBs demonstrates that targeted ultrasound intensity is negatively related to inflammatory tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) and cytotoxic T cell infiltration. Together, endothelial expression of CD93 in tumor is a unique predictor of immunosuppressive microenvironment and CD93&#8208;targeted MBs have a great potential to evaluate tumor immune status.

         <title>Robust Fiber&#8208;Shaped Flexible Temperature Sensors for Safety Monitoring with Ultrahigh Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fiber&#8208;shaped flexible temperature sensors with outstanding deformability and temperature sensing characteristics (broad working range and high sensitivity) are achieved through a two&#8208;step synthetic method. The temperature sensors can effectively capture diverse thermal signals in various applications. Notably, a temperature monitoring and warning system is developed to prevent fire accidents resulting from abnormal thermal runaway in electronic devices.








Abstract
Flexible temperature sensors capable of detecting and transmitting temperature data from the human body, environment, and electronic devices hold significant potential for applications in electronic skins, human&#8211;machine interactions, and disaster prevention systems. Nonetheless, fabricating flexible temperature sensors with exceptional sensing performance remains a formidable task, primarily due to the intricate process of constructing an intrinsically flexible sensing element with high sensitivity. In this study, a facile in situ two&#8208;step synthetic method is introduced for fabricating flexible fiber&#8208;shaped NiO/carbon nanotube fiber (CNTF) composites. The resulting NiO/CNTF flexible temperature sensors demonstrate outstanding deformability and temperature sensing characteristics, encompassing a broad working range (&#8722;15 to 60&#160;&#176;C) and high sensitivity (maximum TCR of &#8722;20.2%&#160;&#176;C&#8722;1 and B value of 3332 K). Importantly, the mechanical and thermal behaviors of the sensor in various application conditions are thoroughly examined using finite element analysis simulations. Moreover, the temperature sensors can effectively capture diverse thermal signals in wearable applications. Notably, a temperature monitoring and warning system is developed to prevent fire accidents resulting from abnormal thermal runaway in electronic devices.

         <title>Polymorphism&#8208;Dependent Organic Room Temperature Phosphorescent Scintillation for X&#8208;Ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two phenothiazine derivatives exhibiting intriguing polymorphism&#8208;dependent phosphorescent radioluminescence features in the crystal under X&#8208;ray irradiation are synthesized. The results reveal that stabilizing triplet excitons by intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions can achieve efficient X&#8208;ray phosphorescent scintillation. The low detection limit of 278 nGys&#8722;1 of resulting scintillators demonstrates the potential of flexible and low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray radiography.








Abstract
Organic phosphorescent scintillating materials have shown great potential for applications in radiography and radiation detection due to their efficient utilization of excitons. However, revealing the relationship between molecule stacking and the phosphorescent radioluminescence of scintillators is still challenging. This study reports on two phenothiazine derivatives with polymorphism&#8208;dependent phosphorescence radioluminescence. The experiments reveal that molecule stacking significantly affects the non&#8208;radiation decay of the triplet excitons of scintillators, which further determines the phosphorescence scintillation performance under X&#8208;ray irradiation. These phosphorescent scintillators exhibit high radio stability and have a low detection limit of 278 nGys&#8722;1. Additionally, the potential application of these scintillators in X&#8208;ray radiography, based on their X&#8208;ray excited radioluminescence properties, is demonstrated. These findings provide a guideline for obtaining high&#8208;performance phosphorescent scintillating materials by shedding light on the effect of crystal packing on the radioluminescence of organic molecules.

         <title>Breaking&#8208;Down Tumoral Physical Barrier by Remotely Unwrapping Metal&#8208;Polyphenol&#8208;Packaged Hyaluronidase for Optimizing Photothermal/Photodynamic Therapy&#8208;Induced Immune Response</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the treatment of iron poisoning, here, the authors propose a remotely unwrapping strategy of metal&#8208;polyphenol&#8208;packaged hyaluronidase (named PPFH) by sequentially injecting PPFH and a clinically used iron&#8208;chelator deferoxamine. Such a cost&#8208;effective HAase delivery strategy memorably improves the subsequent photothermal and photodynamic therapy (PTT/PDT)&#8208;induced intratumoral infiltration of CD8+ T cells and the cross&#8208;talk between tumor and tumor&#8208;draining lymph nodes.








Abstract
The therapy of solid tumors is often hindered by the compact and rigid tumoral extracellular matrix (TECM). Precise reduction of TECM by hyaluronidase (HAase) in combination with nanotechnology is promising for solid tumor therapeutics, yet remains an enormous challenge. Inspired by the treatment of iron poisoning, here a remotely unwrapping strategy is proposed of metal&#8208;polyphenol&#8208;packaged HAase (named PPFH) by sequentially injecting PPFH and a clinically used iron&#8208;chelator deferoxamine (DFO). The in situ dynamic disassembly of PPFH can be triggered by the intravenously injected DFO, resulting in the release, reactivation, and deep penetration of encapsulated HAase inside tumors. Such a cost&#8208;effective HAase delivery strategy memorably improves the subsequent photothermal and photodynamic therapy (PTT/PDT)&#8208;induced intratumoral infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocyte cells and the cross&#8208;talk between tumor and tumor&#8208;draining lymph nodes (TDLN), thereby decreasing the immunosuppression and optimizing tumoricidal immune response that can efficiently protect mice from tumor growth, metastasis, and recurrence in multiple mouse cancer models. Overall, this work presents a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept of the dynamic disassembly of metal&#8208;polyphenol nanoparticles for extracellular drug delivery as well as the modulation of TECM and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment.

         <title>Giant Blue Energy Harvesting in Two&#8208;Dimensional Polymer Membranes with Spatially Aligned Charges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel ion transporting membranes enhance power density during osmotic energy conversion. In this study, positively charged propidium&#8208;based 2D polymer membranes are synthesized with both skeleton and intrinsic space charges. When mixing artificial seawater and river water, a great power density of 48 W m&#8722;2 is achieved, surpassing the performance of most nanofluidic membranes.








Abstract
Blue energy between seawater and river water is attracting increasing interest, as one of the sustainable and renewable energy resources that can be harvested from water. Within the reverse electrodialysis applied in blue energy conversion, novel membranes with nanoscale confinement that function as selective ion transport mediums are currently in high demand for realizing higher power density. The primary challenge lies in constructing well&#8208;defined nanochannels that allow for low&#8208;energy barrier transport. This work proposes a concept for nanofluidic channels with a simultaneous dual electrostatic effect that can enhance both ion selectivity and flux. To actualize this, this work has synthesized propidium iodide&#8208;based two&#8208;dimensional polymer (PI&#8208;2DP) membranes possessing both skeleton charge and intrinsic space charge, which are spatially aligned along the ion transport pathway. The dual charge design of PI&#8208;2DP significantly enhances the electrostatic interaction between the translocating anions and the cationic polymer framework, and a high anion selectivity coefficient (&#8776;0.8) is reached. When mixing standard artificial seawater and river water, this work achieves a considerable power density of 48.4&#160;W m&#8722;2, outperforming most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art nanofluidic membranes. Moreover, when applied between the Mediterranean Sea and the Elbe River, an output power density of 42.2&#160;W m&#8722;2 is achieved by the PI&#8208;2DP. This nanofluidic membrane design with dual&#8208;layer charges will inspire more innovative development of ion&#8208;selective channels for blue energy conversion that will contribute to global energy consumption.

A methodical functionality modulation is carried out to construct an efficient electrocatalyst for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions. The incorporation of cyanovinylene linkage enhances the hydrophilicity and stability of the porous polymers. Furthermore, a gradual insertion of electroactive moieties into the structural backbone leads to the construction of a hollow spherical porous polymer as a highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst.








Abstract
The development of metal&#8208;free bifunctional electrocatalysts for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER) is significant but rarely demonstrated. Porous organic polymers (POPs) with well&#8208;defined electroactive functionalities show superior performance in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Precise control of the active sites' local environment requires careful modulation of linkers through the judicious selection of building units. Here, a systematic strategy is introduced for modulating functionality to design and synthesize a series of thianthrene&#8208;based bifunctional sp2 C&#9552;C bonded POPs with hollow spherical morphologies exhibiting superior electrocatalytic activity. This precise structural tuning allowed to gain insight into the effects of heteroatom incorporation, hydrophilicity, and variations in linker length on electrocatalytic activity. The most efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst THT&#8208;PyDAN achieves a current density of 10 mA cm&#9472;2 at an overpotential (&#951;10) of &#8776;65 mV (in 0.5 m H2SO4) and &#8776;283 mV (in 1 m KOH) for HER and OER, respectively. THT&#8208;PyDAN exhibits superior activity to all previously reported metal&#8208;free bifunctional electrocatalysts in the literature. Furthermore, these investigations demonstrate that THT&#8208;PyDAN maintains its performance even after 36 h of chronoamperometry and 1000 CV cycling. Post&#8208;catalytic characterization using FT&#8208;IR, XPS, and microscopic imaging techniques underscores the long&#8208;term durability of THT&#8208;PyDAN.

         <title>Magnetic Skyrmions above Room Temperature in a van der Waals Ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Room&#8208;temperature N&#233;el skyrmions in Fe3GaTe2 are observed through Lorentz transmission electron microscopy . Upon an optimized field cooling procedure, zero&#8208;field skyrmion lattices are successfully generated in nanoflakes with an extended thickness range. Significantly, these skyrmion lattices remain stable up to 355 K, setting a new record for the highest temperature at which skyrmions can be hosted.








Abstract
2D van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnetic crystals are a promising platform for innovative spintronic devices based on magnetic skyrmions, thanks to their high flexibility and atomic thickness stability. However, room&#8208;temperature skyrmion&#8208;hosting vdW materials are scarce, which poses a challenge for practical applications. In this study, a chemical vapor transport (CVT) approach is employed to synthesize Fe3GaTe2 crystals and room&#8208;temperature N&#233;el skyrmions are observed in Fe3GaTe2 nanoflakes above 58&#160;nm in thickness through in situ Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (L&#8208;TEM). Upon an optimized field cooling procedure, zero&#8208;field hexagonal skyrmion lattices are successfully generated in nanoflakes with an extended thickness range (30&#8211;180&#160;nm). Significantly, these skyrmion lattices remain stable up to 355 K, setting a new record for the highest temperature at which skyrmions can be hosted. The research establishes Fe3GaTe2 as an emerging above&#8208;room&#8208;temperature skyrmion&#8208;hosting vdW material, holding great promise for future spintronics.

         <title>Flexible, Biodegradable, and Wireless Magnetoelectric Paper for Simple In Situ Personalization of Bioelectric Implants</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible, biodegradable bioelectronic paper featuring homogeneously distributed wireless stimulation functionality is presented. This paper synergistically combines lead&#8208;free magnetoelectric nanoparticles for external magnetic field&#8208;induced electrical stimulation and flexible, biodegradable nanofibers for high&#8208;selectivity stimulation, oxygen/nutrient permeation, cell orientation modulation, and biodegradation rate control. Scalability, design flexibility, and rapid customizability are demonstrated through simple paper crafting techniques such as origami and kirigami.








Abstract
Bioelectronic implants delivering electrical stimulation offer an attractive alternative to traditional pharmaceuticals in electrotherapy. However, achieving simple, rapid, and cost&#8208;effective personalization of these implants for customized treatment in unique clinical and physical scenarios presents a substantial challenge. This challenge is further compounded by the need to ensure safety and minimal invasiveness, requiring essential attributes such as flexibility, biocompatibility, lightness, biodegradability, and wireless stimulation capability. Here, a flexible, biodegradable bioelectronic paper with homogeneously distributed wireless stimulation functionality for simple personalization of bioelectronic implants is introduced. The bioelectronic paper synergistically combines i) lead&#8208;free magnetoelectric nanoparticles (MENs) that facilitate electrical stimulation in response to external magnetic field and ii) flexible and biodegradable nanofibers (NFs) that enable localization of MENs for high&#8208;selectivity stimulation, oxygen/nutrient permeation, cell orientation modulation, and biodegradation rate control. The effectiveness of wireless electrical stimulation in vitro through enhanced neuronal differentiation of neuron&#8208;like PC12 cells and the controllability of their microstructural orientation are shown. Also, scalability, design flexibility, and rapid customizability of the bioelectronic paper are shown by creating various 3D macrostructures using simple paper crafting techniques such as cutting and folding. This platform holds promise for simple and rapid personalization of temporary bioelectronic implants for minimally invasive wireless stimulation therapies.

         <title>Harnessing High&#8208;Throughput Computational Methods to Accelerate the Discovery of Optimal Proton Conductors for High&#8208;Performance and Durable Protonic Ceramic Electrochemical Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pivoting to advanced computational methods accelerates the discovery of optimal proton conductors. Calculations predict that BaSnxCe0.8&#8208;xYb0.2O3&#8208;&#948; (BSCYb) exhibits superior conductivity and stability over existing materials. Experimental studies confirm these insights, demonstrating outstanding performance in BSCYb&#8208;based protonic ceramic electrochemical cells (PCECs). This research underscores the potential of computational methodologies in propelling more efficient PCEC systems for power generation and fuel production.









Abstract
The pursuit of high&#8208;performance and long&#8208;lasting protonic ceramic electrochemical cells (PCECs) is impeded by the lack of efficient and enduring proton conductors. Conventional research approaches, predominantly based on a trial&#8208;and&#8208;error methodology, have proven to be demanding of resources and time&#8208;consuming. Here, this work reports the findings in harnessing high&#8208;throughput computational methods to expedite the discovery of optimal electrolytes for PCECs. This work methodically computes the oxygen vacancy formation energy (EV), hydration energy (EH), and the adsorption energies of H2O and CO2 for a set of 932 oxide candidates. Notably, these findings highlight BaSnxCe0.8&#8208;xYb0.2O3&#8208;&#948; (BSCYb) as a prospective game&#8208;changing contender, displaying superior proton conductivity and chemical resilience when compared to the well&#8208;regarded BaZrxCe0.8&#8208;xY0.1Yb0.1O3&#8208;&#948; (BZCYYb) series. Experimental validations substantiate the computational predictions; PCECs incorporating BSCYb as the electrolyte achieved extraordinary peak power densities in the fuel cell mode (0.52 and 1.57&#160;W cm&#8722;2 at 450 and 600 &#176;C, respectively), a current density of 2.62 A cm&#8722;2 at 1.3&#160;V and 600 &#176;C in the electrolysis mode while demonstrating exceptional durability for over 1000&#8208;h when exposed to 50% H2O. This research underscores the transformative potential of high&#8208;throughput computational techniques in advancing the field of proton&#8208;conducting oxides for sustainable power generation and hydrogen production.

A light&#8208;driven rotary motor is co&#8208;self&#8208;assembled in a &#946;&#8208;amyloid&#8208;like structure forming supramolecular hydrogels. Upon UV irradiation, the work produced by the continuous rotation of the motor is shown to disrupt the hydrogen bonds of the self&#8208;assembled system, leading to an endergonic gel&#8208;to&#8208;sol transition in out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium conditions. The structure of the original hydrogel is subsequently recovered in the dark.








Abstract
Artificial molecular motors have the potential to generate mechanical work on their environment by producing autonomous unidirectional motions when supplied with a source of energy. However, the harnessing of this mechanical work to subsequently activate various endoenergetic processes that can be useful in materials science remains elusive. Here, it is shown that by integrating a light&#8208;driven rotary motor through hydrogen bonds in a &#946;&#8208;amyloid&#8208;like structure forming supramolecular hydrogels, the mechanical work generated during the constant rotation of the molecular machine under UV irradiation is sufficient to disrupt the &#946;&#8208;amyloid fibers and to trigger a gel&#8208;to&#8208;sol transition at macroscopic scale. This melting of the gel under UV irradiation occurs 25 &#176;C below the temperature needed to melt it by solely using thermal activation. In the dark, a reversible sol&#8211;gel transition is observed as the system fully recovers its original microstructure, thus illustrating the possible access to new kinds of motorized materials that can be controlled by advanced out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium thermodynamics.

Core&#8211;bishell PdCu@Au@SiO2&#160;nanotripods significantly enhance photon absorption in the NIR range for semi&#8208;transparent organic solar cells. An optical coupling&#160;multilayer&#160;consisting of ZnS(130&#160;nm)/Na3AlF6(60&#160;nm)/WO3(100&#160;nm)/LaF3(50&#160;nm) enhances the NIR light utilization and the visible transparency. These strategies&#160;result in a record&#8208;high PCE of 16.14% along with an excellent AVT of over 30%, correspond to the record LUE of 5.33%.









Abstract
Semitransparent organic photovoltaics (ST&#8208;OPVs) offer promising prospects for application in building&#8208;integrated photovoltaic systems and greenhouses, but further improvement of their performance faces a delicate trade&#8208;off between the two competing indexes of power conversion efficiency (PCE) and average visible transmittance (AVT). Herein, the authors take advantage of coupling plasmonics with the optical design of ST&#8208;OPVs to enhance near&#8208;infrared absorption and hence simultaneously improve efficiency and visible transparency to the maximum extent. By integrating core&#8211;bishell PdCu@Au@SiO2 nanotripods that act as optically isotropic Lambertian sources with near&#8208;infrared&#8208;customized localized surface plasmon resonance in an optimal ternary PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based ST&#8208;OPV, it is shown that their interplay with a multilayer optical coupling layer, consisting of ZnS(130&#160;nm)/Na3AlF6(60&#160;nm)/WO3(100&#160;nm)/LaF3(50&#160;nm) identified from high&#8208;throughput optical screening, leads to a record&#8208;high PCE of 16.14% (certified as 15.90%) along with an excellent AVT of 33.02%. The strong enhancement of the light utilization efficiency by &#8776;50% as compared to the counterpart device without optical engineering provides an encouraging and universal pathway for promoting breakthroughs in ST&#8208;OPVs from meticulous optical design.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Scale Visualization of Multiferroicity in Monolayer NiI2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used to probe and characterize the multiferroic order in monolayer NiI2. Its type&#8208;II multiferroic order arises from the combination of a magnetic spin spiral order and a strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling. These results on magnetoelectric effects at the atomic scale suggest new ways to engineer multiferroic orders in van der Waals materials and their heterostructures.








Abstract
Progress in layered van der Waals materials has resulted in the discovery of ferromagnetic and ferroelectric materials down to the monolayer limit. Recently, evidence of the first purely 2D multiferroic material was&#160;reported in monolayer NiI2. However, probing multiferroicity with scattering&#8208;based and optical bulk techniques is challenging on 2D materials, and experiments on the atomic scale are needed to fully characterize the multiferroic order at the monolayer limit. Here, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations is used to probe and characterize the multiferroic order in monolayer NiI2. It is demonstrated that the type&#8208;II multiferroic order displayed by NiI2, arising from the combination of a magnetic spin spiral order and a strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling, allows probing the multiferroic order in the STM experiments. Moreover, the magnetoelectric coupling of NiI2 is directly probed by external electric field manipulation of the multiferroic domains. The findings establish a novel point of view to analyze magnetoelectric effects at the microscopic level, paving the way toward engineering new multiferroic orders in van der Waals materials and their&#160;heterostructures.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The topological transition in twisted bilayer materials has attracted considerable attention in nano&#8208;optics. In the analogue of acoustics, however, no such topological transition has been found experimentally due to the inherent scalar property of sound pressure. In this work, by using a nonlocal design, the in&#8208;plane acoustic pressure is transformed into a spatially distributed vector field using twisted multilayer metasurfaces.








Abstract
The discovery of the topological transition in twisted bilayer (tBL) materials has attracted considerable attention in nano&#8208;optics. In the analogue of acoustics, however, no such topological transition has been found due to the inherent nondirectional scalar property of acoustic pressure. In this work, by using a theory&#8208;based nonlocal anisotropic design, the in&#8208;plane acoustic pressure is transformed into a spatially distributed vector field using twisted multilayer metasurfaces. So&#8208;called &#8220;acoustic magic angle&#8221;&#8208;related acoustic phenomena occur, such as nonlocal polariton hybridization and the topological Lifshitz transition. The dispersion becomes flat at the acoustic magic angle, enabling polarized excitations to propagate in a single direction. Moreover, the acoustic topological transition (from hyperbolic to elliptic dispersion) is experimentally observed for the first time as the twist angle continuously changes. This unique characteristic facilitates low&#8208;loss tunable polariton hybridization at the subwavelength scale. A twisted trilayer acoustic metasurface is also experimentally demonstrated, and more possibilities for manipulating acoustic waves are found. These discoveries not only enrich the concepts of moir&#233; physics and topological acoustics but also provide a complete framework of theory and methodologies for explaining the phenomena that are observed.

         <title>Discovering a New Drug Against Acute Kidney Injury by Using a Tailored Photoacoustic Imaging Probe</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Given the revelation of myeloperoxidase overexpression and redox imbalance of ClO&#8722;/GSH in acute kidney injury (AKI), a tailored photoacoustic (PA) probe is developed that enables real&#8208;time, noninvasive monitoring of AKI levels through PA imaging. Leveraging this probe, this work has established a drug screening approach and has discovered, for the first time, the therapeutic potential of astragalin in treating AKI.








Abstract
Acute kidney injury (AKI) has become an increasing concern for patients due to the widespread clinical use of nephrotoxic drugs. Currently, the early diagnosis of AKI is still challenging and the available therapeutic drugs cannot meet the clinical demand. Herein, this work has investigated the key redox couple involved in AKI and develops a tailored photoacoustic (PA) imaging probe (AB&#8208;DiOH) which can reversibly respond to hypochlorite (ClO&#8722;)/glutathione (GSH) with high specificity and sensitivity. This probe enables the real&#8208;time monitoring of AKI by noninvasive PA imaging, with better detection sensitivity than the blood test. Furthermore, this probe is utilized for screening nephroprotective drugs among natural products. For the first time, astragalin is discovered to be a potential new drug for the treatment of AKI. After oral administration, astragalin can be efficiently absorbed by the animal body, alleviate kidney injury, and meanwhile induce no damage to other normal tissues. The treatment mechanism of astragalin has also been revealed to be the simultaneous inhibition of oxidative stress, ferroptosis, and cuproposis. The developed PA imaging probe and the discovered drug candidate provide a promising new tool and strategy for the early diagnosis and effective treatment of AKI.

&lt;p&gt;Given the revelation of myeloperoxidase overexpression and redox imbalance of ClO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/GSH in acute kidney injury (AKI), a tailored photoacoustic (PA) probe is developed that enables real-time, noninvasive monitoring of AKI levels through PA imaging. Leveraging this probe, this work has established a drug screening approach and has discovered, for the first time, the therapeutic potential of astragalin in treating AKI.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute kidney injury (AKI) has become an increasing concern for patients due to the widespread clinical use of nephrotoxic drugs. Currently, the early diagnosis of AKI is still challenging and the available therapeutic drugs cannot meet the clinical demand. Herein, this work has investigated the key redox couple involved in AKI and develops a tailored photoacoustic (PA) imaging probe (AB-DiOH) which can reversibly respond to hypochlorite (ClO&#8722;)/glutathione (GSH) with high specificity and sensitivity. This probe enables the real-time monitoring of AKI by noninvasive PA imaging, with better detection sensitivity than the blood test. Furthermore, this probe is utilized for screening nephroprotective drugs among natural products. For the first time, astragalin is discovered to be a potential new drug for the treatment of AKI. After oral administration, astragalin can be efficiently absorbed by the animal body, alleviate kidney injury, and meanwhile induce no damage to other normal tissues. The treatment mechanism of astragalin has also been revealed to be the simultaneous inhibition of oxidative stress, ferroptosis, and cuproposis. The developed PA imaging probe and the discovered drug candidate provide a promising new tool and strategy for the early diagnosis and effective treatment of AKI.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sustainable and Rapid Water Purification at the Confined Hydrogel Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>

This work demonstrates the design insight into the peroxymonosulfate activation system by boosting the mass transfer performance within hydrogel interfaces for ultrafast water purification.








Abstract
Emerging organic contaminants in water matrices have challenged ecosystems and human health safety. Persulfate&#8208;based advanced oxidation processes (PS&#8208;AOPs) have attracted much attention as they address potential water purification challenges. However, overcoming the mass transfer constraint and the catalyst's inherent site agglomeration in the heterogeneous system remains urgent. Herein, the abundant metal&#8208;anchored loading (&#8776;6&#8211;8&#160;g m&#8722;2) of alginate hydrogel membranes coupled with cross&#8208;flow mode as an efficient strategy for water purification applications is proposed. The organic flux of the confined hydrogel interfaces sharply enlarges with the reduction of the thickness of the boundary layer via the pressure field. The normalized property of the system displays a remarkable organic (sulfonamides) elimination rate of 4.87 &#215; 104&#160;mg min&#8722;1 mol&#8722;1. Furthermore, due to the fast reaction time (&lt;1&#160;min), cross&#8208;flow mode only reaches a meager energy cost (&#8776;2.21&#160;Wh m&#8722;3) under the pressure drive field. It is anticipated that this finding provides insight into the novel design with ultrafast organic removal performance and low techno&#8208;economic cost (i.e., energy operation cost, material, and reagent cost) for the field of water purification under various PS&#8208;AOPs challenging scenarios.

         <title>In Situ Piezoelectric&#8208;Catalytic Anti&#8208;Inflammation Promotes the Rehabilitation of Acute Spinal Cord Injury in Synergy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports an effective and controllable H2&#8208;based nanocatalytic treatment strategy in which biocompatible Au@BT NPs are constructed to catalyze H2 generation in response to ultrasound exposure to achieve anti&#8208;inflammatory effect through scavenging ROS; thus, achieving a notable therapeutic improvement in their motor function.








Abstract
Relieving inflammation via scavenging toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) during the acute phase of spinal cord injury (SCI) proves to be an effective strategy to mitigate secondary spinal cord injury and improve recovery of motor function. However, commonly used corticosteroid anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs show adverse side effects which may induce increased risk of wound infection. Fortunately, hydrogen (H2), featuring selective antioxidant performance, easy penetrability, and excellent biosafety, is being extensively investigated as a potential anti&#8208;inflammatory therapeutic gas for the treatment of SCI. In this work, by a facile in situ growth approach of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) on the piezoelectric BaTiO3, a particulate nanocomposite with Schottky heterojunction (Au@BT) is synthesized, which can generate H2 continuously by catalyzing H+ reduction through piezoelectric catalysis. Further, theoretical calculations are employed to reveal the piezoelectric catalytic mechanism of Au@BT. Transcriptomics analysis and nontargeted large&#8208;scale metabolomic analysis reveal the deeper mechanism of the neuroprotective effect of H2 therapy. The as&#8208;prepared Au@BT nanoparticle is first explored as a flexible hydrogen gas generator for efficient SCI therapy. This study highlights a promising prospect of nanocatalytic medicine for disease treatments by catalyzing H2 generation; thus, offering a significant alternative to conventional approaches against refractory spinal cord injury.

         <title>Early Diagnosis and Prognosis Prediction of Pancreatic Cancer Using Engineered Hybrid Core&#8208;Shells in Laser Desorption/Ionization Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops designer Au@SiO2@ZrO2 core&#8208;shells with tunable structural features for direct laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (LDI&#8208;MS) based recording of serum metabolic fingerprints (SMFs), enabling both early diagnosis and prognostic prediction of pancreatic cancer (PC). This work highlights the synergistic effect of core&#8208;shell structures in LDI and offers insights into the material&#8208;based cancer diagnosis and prognosis.








Abstract
Effective detection of bio&#8208;molecules relies on the precise design and preparation of materials, particularly in laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (LDI&#8208;MS). Despite significant advancements in substrate materials, the performance of single&#8208;structured substrates remains suboptimal for LDI&#8208;MS analysis of complex systems. Herein, designer Au@SiO2@ZrO2 core&#8208;shell substrates are developed for LDI&#8208;MS&#8208;based early diagnosis and prognosis of pancreatic cancer (PC). Through controlling Au core size and ZrO2 shell crystallization, signal amplification of metabolites up to 3 orders is not only achieved, but also the synergistic mechanism of the LDI process is revealed. The optimized Au@SiO2@ZrO2 enables a direct record of serum metabolic fingerprints (SMFs) by LDI&#8208;MS. Subsequently, SMFs are employed to distinguish early PC (stage I/II) from controls, with an accuracy of 92%. Moreover, a prognostic prediction scoring system is established with enhanced efficacy in predicting PC survival compared to CA19&#8208;9 (p &lt; 0.05). This work contributes to material&#8208;based cancer diagnosis and prognosis.

         <title>Freeze&#8208;Thaw Microfluidic System Produces &#8220;Themis&#8221; Nanocomplex for Cleaning Persisters&#8208;Infected Macrophages and Enhancing Uninfected Macrophages</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;Themis&#8221; nanocomplex (TNC) is fabricated via a microfluidic chip based on the freeze&#8208;thaw strategy. For infected macrophages, TNC releases heme to reconstruct the respiratory chain complexes of intracellular persisters, forcing them to regrow. For uninfected macrophages, TNC upregulates TCA cycle and OXPHOS, contributing to the immunoenhancement. The combined effect of TNC provides a promising strategy for intracellular bacteria therapy.








Abstract
Macrophages are the primary effectors against potential pathogen infections. They can be &#8220;parasitized&#8221; by intracellular bacteria, serving as &#8220;accomplices&#8221;, protecting intracellular bacteria and even switching them to persisters. Here, using a freeze&#8208;thaw strategy&#8208;based microfluidic chip, a &#8220;Themis&#8221; nanocomplex (TNC) is created. The TNC consists of Lactobacillus reuteri&#8208;derived membrane vesicles, heme, and vancomycin, which cleaned infected macrophages and enhanced uninfected macrophages. In infected macrophages, TNC releases heme that led to the reconstruction of the respiratory chain complexes of intracellular persisters, forcing them to regrow. The revived bacteria produces virulence factors that destroyed host macrophages (accomplices), thereby being externalized and becoming vulnerable to immune responses. In uninfected macrophages, TNC upregulates the TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), contributing to immunoenhancement. The combined effect of TNC of cleaning the accomplice (infected macrophages) and reinforcing uninfected macrophages provides a promising strategy for intracellular bacterial therapy.

         <title>Mapping Extracellular Space Features of Viral Encephalitis to Evaluate the Proficiency of Anti&#8208;Viral Drugs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust approach that utilizes single particle diffusion fingerprinting of quantum dots, along with machine learning, to map brain extracellular space features and predict the efficacy of drugs against viral encephalitis is developed.








Abstract
The extracellular space (ECS) is an important barrier against viral attack on brain cells, and dynamic changes in ECS microstructure characteristics are closely related to the progression of viral encephalitis in the brain and the efficacy of antiviral drugs. However, mapping the precise morphological and rheological features of the ECS in viral encephalitis is still challenging so far. Here, a robust approach is developed using single&#8208;particle diffusional fingerprinting of quantum dots combined with machine learning to map ECS features in the brain and predict the efficacy of antiviral encephalitis drugs. These results demonstrated that this approach can characterize the microrheology and geometry of the brain ECS at different stages of viral infection and identify subtle changes induced by different drug treatments. This approach provides a potential platform for drug proficiency assessment and is expected to offer a reliable basis for the clinical translation of drugs.

         <title>Mitocytosis Mediated by an Enzyme&#8208;Activable Mitochondrion&#8208;Disturbing Polymer&#8208;Drug Conjugate Enhances Active Penetration in Glioblastoma Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzyme&#8208;activable mitochondrion&#8208;disturbing nanomedicine assembled from an amphiphilic block polymer&#8208;drug conjugate is developed for achieving efficient blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) crossing and deep glioblastoma (GBM) penetration. This nanomedicine interferes mitochondrial homeostasis, which mediates the process of mitocytosis for mitochondrial quality control, facilitating mitosome&#8208;mediated active transcellular transport in GBM tissues.








Abstract
The application of nanomedicines for glioblastoma (GBM) therapy is hampered by the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) and the dense glioblastoma tissue. To achieve efficient BBB crossing and deep GBM penetration, this work demonstrates a strategy of active transcellular transport of a mitochondrion&#8208;disturbing nanomedicine, pGBEMA22&#8208;b&#8208;pSSPPT9 (GBEPPT), in the GBM tissue through mitocytosis. GBEPPT is computer&#8208;aided designed and prepared by self&#8208;assembling a conjugate of an amphiphilic block polymer and a drug podophyllotoxin (PPT). When GBEPPT is delivered to the tumor site, overexpressed &#947;&#8208;glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) on the brain&#8211;blood endothelial cell, or the GBM cell triggered enzymatic hydrolysis of &#947;&#8208;glutamylamide on GBEPPT to reverse its negative charge to positive. Positively charged GBEPPT rapidly enter into the cell and target the mitochondria. These GBEPPT disturb the homeostasis of mitochondria, inducing mitocytosis&#8208;mediated extracellular transport of GBEPPT to the neighboring cells via mitosomes. This intracellular&#8208;to&#8208;intercellular delivery cycle allows GBEPPT to penetrate deeply into the GBM parenchyma, and exert sustainable action of PPT released from GBEPPT on the tumor cells along its penetration path at the tumor site, thus improving the anti&#8208;GBM effect. The process of mitocytosis mediated by the mitochondrion&#8208;disturbing nanomedicine may offer great potential in enhancing drug penetration through malignant tissues, especially poorly permeable solid tumors.

         <title>Monolithic 2D Perovskites Enabled Artificial Photonic Synapses for Neuromorphic Vision Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new persistent photocurrent mechanism based on ion motion and ion&#8208;exciton coupling is proposed in two dimensional perovskites. The special charge carrier dynamics lead to the bio&#8208;plausible synaptic characteristics of the photodetectors. The light&#8208;tunable synaptic plasticity enables not only to realize image preprocessing, but also effectively recognizes target images by learning critical features.








Abstract
Neuromorphic visual sensors (NVS) based on photonic synapses hold a significant promise to emulate the human visual system. However, current photonic synapses rely on exquisite engineering of the complex heterogeneous interface to realize learning and memory functions, resulting in high fabrication cost, reduced reliability, high energy consumption and uncompact architecture, severely limiting the up&#8208;scaled manufacture, and on&#8208;chip integration. Here a photo&#8208;memory fundamental based on ion&#8208;exciton coupling is innovated to simplify synaptic structure and minimize energy consumption. Due to the intrinsic organic/inorganic interface within the crystal, the photodetector based on monolithic 2D perovskite exhibits a persistent photocurrent lasting about 90&#160;s, enabling versatile synaptic functions. The electrical power consumption per synaptic event is estimated to be&#8776;1.45&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;16&#160;J, one order of magnitude lower than that in a natural biological system. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept image preprocessing using the neuromorphic vision sensors enabled by photonic synapse demonstrates 4 times enhancement of classification accuracy. Furthermore, getting rid of the artificial neural network, an expectation&#8208;based thresholding model is put forward to mimic the human visual system for facial recognition. This conceptual device unveils a new mechanism to simplify synaptic structure, promising the transformation of the NVS and fostering the emergence of next generation neural networks.

         <title>Enhancing Photosynthesis Efficiency of Hydrogen Peroxide by Modulating Side Chains to Facilitate Water Oxidation at Low&#8208;Energy Barrier Sites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>

Linked electron donor&#8211;acceptor conjugated polymers are constructed alternately and introduce electron&#8208;withdrawing groups into the side chains of electron donors to mediate the active sites responsible for water oxidation. Under anaerobic conditions, its H2O2 photosynthetic efficiency via water oxidation reaction reaches an impressive 1365&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8208;1&#160;h&#8208;1. Remarkably, the photocatalyst achieves a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion of 0.64%, the highest reported in natural water.








Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a crucial oxidant in advanced oxidation processes. In situ, photosynthesis of it in natural water holds the promise of practical application for water remediation. However, current photosynthesis of H2O2 systems primarily relies on oxygen reduction, leading to limited performance in natural water with low dissolved oxygen or anaerobic conditions found in polluted water. Herein, a novel photocatalyst based on conjugated polymers with alternating electron donor&#8211;acceptor structures and electron&#8208;withdrawing side chains on electron donors is introduced. Specifically, carbazole functions as the electron donor, triazine serves as the electron acceptor, and cyano acts as the electron&#8208;withdrawing side chain. Notably, the photocatalyst exhibits a remarkable solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion of 0.64%, the highest reported in natural water. Furthermore, even in anaerobic conditions, it achieves an impressive H2O2 photosynthetic efficiency of 1365&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1, surpassing all the reported photosynthetic systems of H2O2. This remarkable improvement is attributed to the effective relocation of the water oxidation active site from a high&#8208;energy carbazole to a low&#8208;energy acetylene site mediated by the side chains, resulting in enhanced O2 or H2O2 generation from water. This breakthrough offers a new avenue for efficient water remediation using advanced oxidation technologies in oxygen&#8208;limited environments, holding significant implications for environmental restoration.

         <title>Highly Flexible, High&#8208;Performance, and Stretchable Piezoelectric Sensor Based on a Hierarchical Droplet&#8208;Shaped Ceramics with Enhanced Damage Tolerance</title>

Schematic showing the development of stretchable hierarchical ceramic sensors through a novel soft&#8208;rigid hybrid strategy, whose configuration ensures excellent mechanical flexibility, high piezoelectric activity and structural robustness, including a linear response, wide&#8208;angle twisting, and wide range of stretching. This new sensor is successfully used for both wireless gesture recognition and the assessment of the progression of knee osteoarthritis.








Abstract
Stretchable self&#8208;powered sensors are of significant interest in next&#8208;generation wearable electronics. However, current strategies for creating stretchable piezoelectric sensors based on piezoelectric polymers or 0&#8211;3 piezoelectric composites face several challenges such as low piezoelectric activity, low sensitivity, and poor durability. In this paper, a biomimetic soft&#8208;rigid hybrid strategy is used to construct a new form of highly flexible, high&#8208;performance, and stretchable piezoelectric sensor. Inspired by the hinged bivalve Cristaria plicata, hierarchical droplet&#8208;shaped ceramics are manufactured and used as rigid components, where computational models indicate that the unique arched curved surface and rounded corners of this bionic structure can alleviate stress concentrations. To ensure electrical connectivity of the piezoelectric phase during stretching, a patterned liquid metal acts as a soft circuit and a silicone polymer with optimized wettability and stretchability serves as a soft component that forms a strong mechanical interlock with the hierarchical ceramics. The novel sensor design exhibits excellent sensitivity and durability, where the open circuit voltage remains stable after 5000 stretching cycles at 60% strain and 5000 twisting cycles at 180&#176;. To demonstrate its potential in heathcare applications, this new stretchable sensor is successfully used for wireless gesture recognition and assessing the progression of knee osteoarthritis.

         <title>Beyond Conventional Carbon Activation: Creating Porosity without Etching Using Cesium Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and efficient synthetic strategy is proposed for highly porous carbons with a high yield of 25% and a specific surface area of 3008 m2 g&#8722;1 upon thermal treatment of carboxylic acids and Cs2CO3. The unconventional roles of Cs species are unraveled as an electron injector and intercalation agent to promote the formation of carbonaceous frameworks and porous structures.








Abstract
Facile synthesis of porous carbon with high yield and high specific surface area (SSA) from low&#8208;cost molecular precursors offers promising opportunities for their industrial applications. However, conventional activation methods using potassium and sodium hydroxides or carbonates suffer from low yields (&lt;20%) and poor control over porosity and composition especially when high SSAs are targeted (&gt;2000 m2 g&#8722;1) because nanopores are typically created by etching. Herein, a non&#8208;etching activation strategy is demonstrated using cesium salts of low&#8208;cost carboxylic acids as the sole precursor in producing porous carbons with yields of up to 25% and SSAs reaching 3008 m2 g&#8722;1. The pore size and oxygen content can be adjusted by tuning the synthesis temperature or changing the molecular precursor. Mechanistic investigation unravels the non&#8208;classical role of cesium as an activating agent. The cesium compounds that form in situ, including carbonates, oxides, and metallic cesium, have extremely low work function enabling electron injection into organic/carbonaceous framework, promoting condensation, and intercalation of cesium ions into graphitic stacks forming slit pores. The resulting porous carbons deliver a high capacity of 252 mAh g&#8722;1 (567 F g&#8722;1) and durability of 100&#160;000 cycles as cathodes of Zn&#8208;ion capacitors, showing their potential for electrochemical energy storage.

         <title>Bioengineered Neutrophils for Smart Response in Brain Infection Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
CellUs integrates live neutrophils enveloping a liposomal formulation of antibiotic ceftriaxone, steroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drug dexamethasone, and oxygen&#8208;loaded perfluorocarbon, for treating brain infections. CellUs leverages the natural chemotactic property of neutrophils to penetrate the blood&#8211;brain barrier, accurately targets infection sites, and synchronizes the release of therapeutic agents under the ultrasound stimulation, thereby combating both bacterial infection and excess inflammatory cytokines.








Abstract
Brain infections, frequently accompanied by significant inflammation, necessitate comprehensive therapeutic approaches targeting both infections and associated inflammation. A major impediment to such combined treatment is the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB), which significantly restricts therapeutic agents from achieving effective concentrations within the central nervous system. Here, a neutrophil&#8208;centric dual&#8208;responsive delivery system, coined &#8220;CellUs,&#8221; is pioneered. This system is characterized by live neutrophils enveloping liposomes of dexamethasone, ceftriaxone, and oxygen&#8208;saturated perfluorocarbon (Lipo@D/C/P). CellUs is meticulously engineered to co&#8208;deliver antibiotics, anti&#8208;inflammatory agents, and oxygen, embodying a comprehensive strategy against brain infections. CellUs leverages the intrinsic abilities of neutrophils to navigate through BBB, accurately target infection sites, and synchronize the release of Lipo@D/C/P with local inflammatory signals. Notably, the incorporation of ultrasound&#8208;responsive perfluorocarbon within Lipo@D/C/P ensures the on&#8208;demand release of therapeutic agents at the afflicted regions. CellUs shows considerable promise in treating Staphylococcus aureus infections in mice with meningitis, particularly when combined with ultrasound treatments. It effectively penetrates BBB, significantly eliminates bacteria, reduces inflammation, and delivers oxygen to the affected brain tissue, resulting in a substantial improvement in survival rates. Consequently, CellUs harnesses the natural chemotactic properties of neutrophils and offers an innovative pathway to improve treatment effectiveness while minimizing adverse effects.

         <title>Programming Polarity Heterogeneity of Energy Storage Dielectrics by Bidirectional Intelligent Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bidirectional intelligent design with phase&#8208;field simulation and machine learning is performed to study the influence of local polarity heterogeneity on the energy storage performance in BiFeO3&#8208;based dielectrics. By reversely optimization, a maximal energy density of 188 J cm&#8722;3 with efficiency above 95% at 8 MV cm&#8722;1 is obtained in BiFeO3&#8208;Al2O3 systems with nanopillar&#8208;like polar regions. 








Abstract
Dielectric capacitors, characterized by ultra&#8208;high power densities, are considered as fundamental energy storage components in electronic and electrical systems. However, synergistically improving energy densities and efficiencies remains a daunting challenge. Understanding the role of polarity&#160;heterogeneity at the nanoscale in determining polarization response is crucial to the domain engineering of high&#8208;performance dielectrics. Here, a bidirectional design with phase&#8208;field simulation and machine learning is performed to forward reveal the structure&#8208;property relationship and reversely optimize polarity heterogeneity to improve energy storage performance. Taking BiFeO3&#8208;based dielectrics as typical systems, this work establishes the mapping diagrams of energy density and efficiency dependence on the volume fraction, size and configuration of polar regions. Assisted by CatBoost and Wolf Pack algorithms, this work analyzes the contributions of geometric factors and intrinsic features and find that nanopillar&#8208;like polar regions show great potential in achieving both high polarization intensity and fast dipole switching. Finally, a maximal energy density of 188 J cm&#8722;3 with efficiency above 95% at 8 MV cm&#8722;1 is obtained in BiFeO3&#8208;Al2O3 systems. This work provides a general method to study the influence of local polar heterogeneity on polarization behaviors and proposes effective strategies to enhance energy storage performance by tuning polarity heterogeneity.

         <title>Fluidic Ultrasound Generation for Non&#8208;Destructive Testing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Air&#8208;coupled ultrasound enables material characterization and fault detection for specimens that are very large or do not allow contact with other materials. This study presents a novel fluidic transducer that can withstand harsh environments and generates a high&#8208;amplitude ultrasonic signal without impedance mismatch to air. Its usability for time&#8208;of&#8208;flight measurements was&#160;verified and compared to piezoelectric transducers.








Abstract
Air&#8208;coupled ultrasonic testing (ACU) is a pioneering technique in non&#8208;destructive testing (NDT). While contact testing and fluid immersion testing are standard methods in many applications, the adoption of ACU is progressing slowly, especially in the low ultrasonic frequency range. A main reason for this development is the difficulty of generating high amplitude ultrasonic bursts with equipment that is robust enough to be applied outside a laboratory environment. This paper presents the fluidic ultrasonic transducer as a solution to this challenge. This novel aeroacoustic source uses the flow instability of a sonic jet in a bistable fluidic switch to generate ultrasonic bursts up to 60&#160;kHz with a mean peak pressure of 320&#160;Pa.

&lt;p&gt;Air-coupled ultrasound enables material characterization and fault detection for specimens that are very large or do not allow contact with other materials. This study presents a novel fluidic transducer that can withstand harsh environments and generates a high-amplitude ultrasonic signal without impedance mismatch to air. Its usability for time-of-flight measurements was&#160;verified and compared to piezoelectric transducers.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air-coupled ultrasonic testing (ACU) is a pioneering technique in non-destructive testing (NDT). While contact testing and fluid immersion testing are standard methods in many applications, the adoption of ACU is progressing slowly, especially in the low ultrasonic frequency range. A main reason for this development is the difficulty of generating high amplitude ultrasonic bursts with equipment that is robust enough to be applied outside a laboratory environment. This paper presents the fluidic ultrasonic transducer as a solution to this challenge. This novel aeroacoustic source uses the flow instability of a sonic jet in a bistable fluidic switch to generate ultrasonic bursts up to 60&#160;kHz with a mean peak pressure of 320&#160;Pa. The robust design allows operation in adverse environments, independent of the operating fluid. Non-contact through-transmission experiments are conducted on four materials and compared with the results of conventional transducers. For the first time, it is shown that the novel fluidic ultrasonic transducer provides a suitable acoustic signal for NDT tasks and has potential of furthering the implementation of ACU in industrial&#160;applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Infinite Self&#8208;Propulsion of Circularly On/Discharged Droplets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
On the superhydrophobic surface printed with symmetrical waved alternating potential, the droplets can be circularly charged or discharged during the transport process. By deeply studying the motion mechanisms for neutral droplets and charged droplets, the circularly on/discharged droplets achieve the infinite self&#8208;propulsion (&gt;1000 mm) with an ultrahigh velocity of meters per second.








Abstract
Self&#8208;propulsion of droplets in a controlled and long path at a high&#8208;speed is crucial for organic synthesis, pathological diagnosis and programable lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip. To date, extensive efforts have been made to achieve droplet self&#8208;propulsion by asymmetric gradient, yet, existing structural, chemical, or charge density gradients can only last for a while (&lt;50&#160;mm). Here, this work designs a symmetrical waved alternating potential (WAP) on a superhydrophobic surface to charge or discharge the droplets during the transport process. By deeply studying the motion mechanisms for neutral droplets and charged droplets, the circularly on/discharged droplets achieve the infinite self&#8208;propulsion (&gt;1000&#160;mm) with an ultrahigh velocity of meters per second. In addition, after permutation and combination of two motion styles of the droplets, it can be competent for more interesting work, such as liquid diode and liquid logic gate. Being assembled into a microfluidic chip, the strategy would be applied in chemical synthesis, cell culture, and diagnostic kits.

         <title>Heterojunction&#8208;Induced Rapid Transformation of Ni3+/Ni2+ Sites which Mediates Urea Oxidation for Energy&#8208;Efficient Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Ni3+/Ni2+&#8208;mediated urea oxidation pathway is achieved via constructing heterojunction of nickel metaphosphate and nickel telluride (Ni2P4O12/NiTe), resulting in a record&#8208;high electrocatalytic urea oxidation performance. Furthermore, achieving excellent hydrogen evolution property in a urea electrolysis electrolyzer equipped with Ni2P4O12/NiTe as bi&#8208;functional electrocatalysts (Ni2P4O12/NiTe || Ni2P4O12/NiTe), steadily delivering 100 mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.475 V over 500 h.








Abstract
Water electrolysis is an environmentally&#8208;friendly strategy for hydrogen production but suffers from significant energy consumption. Substituting urea oxidation reaction (UOR) with lower theoretical voltage for water oxidation reaction adopting nickel&#8208;based electrocatalysts engenders reduced energy consumption for hydrogen production. The main obstacle remains strong interaction between accumulated Ni3+ and *COO in the conventional Ni3+&#8208;catalyzing pathway. Herein, a novel Ni3+/Ni2+ mediated pathway for UOR via constructing a heterojunction of nickel metaphosphate and nickel telluride (Ni2P4O12/NiTe), which efficiently lowers the energy barrier of UOR and avoids the accumulation of Ni3+ and excessive adsorption of *COO on the electrocatalysts, is developed. As a result, Ni2P4O12/NiTe demonstrates an exceptionally low potential of 1.313&#160;V to achieve a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 toward efficient urea oxidation reaction while simultaneously showcases an overpotential of merely 24&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for hydrogen evolution reaction. Constructing urea electrolysis electrolyzer using Ni2P4O12/NiTe at both sides attains 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at a low cell voltage of 1.475&#160;V along with excellent stability over 500 h accompanied with nearly 100% Faradic efficiency.

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature, Universal Synthetic Route for Mesoporous Metal Oxides by Exploiting Synergistic Effect of Thermal Activation and Plasma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistic effect of thermal activation and plasma enabled low&#8208;temperature synthesis (150&#8211;200&#160;&#176;C) of various mesoporous metal oxide (V2O5, V6O13, TiO2, WO3, Nb2O5, and MoO3), suitable for flexible polymeric substrates. As a proof of concept, the direct synthesis of mesoporous V2O5 is demonstrated on an indium&#8208;tin oxide&#8208;coated polyimide film and its application as electrode materials.








Abstract
Mesoporous metal oxides exhibit excellent physicochemical properties and are widely used in various fields, including energy storage/conversion, catalysis, and sensors. Although several soft&#8208;template approaches are reported, high&#8208;temperature calcination for both metal oxide formation and template removal is necessary, which limits direct synthesis on a plastic substrate for flexible devices. Here, a universal synthetic approach that combines thermal activation and oxygen plasma to synthesize diverse mesoporous metal oxides (V2O5, V6O13, TiO2, Nb2O5, WO3, and MoO3) at low temperatures (150&#8211;200&#160;&#176;C), which can be applicable to a flexible polymeric substrate is introduced. As a demonstration, a flexible micro&#8208;supercapacitor is fabricated by directly synthesizing mesoporous V2O5 on an indium&#8208;tin oxide&#8208;coated colorless polyimide film. The energy storage performance is well maintained under severe bending conditions.

         <title>Current&#8208;Controllable and Reversible Multi&#8208;Resistance&#8208;State Based on Domain Wall Number Transition in 2D Ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multi&#8208;output state of the resistance is acquired by a pure current strategy based on the manipulation of domain wall number by pulse current under zero magnetic field in the 2D ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2. The multi&#8208;output properties can be utilized in the pattern recognition in the neuron computing trained by National Institute of Standards and Technology dataset.








Abstract
Controlling the multi&#8208;state switching is significantly essential for the extensive utilization of 2D ferromagnet in magnetic racetrack memories, topological devices, and neuromorphic computing devices. The development of all&#8208;electric functional nanodevices with multi&#8208;state switching and a rapid reset remains challenging. Herein, to imitate the potentiation and depression process of biological synapses, a full&#8208;current strategy is unprecedently established by the controllable resistance&#8208;state switching originating from the spin configuration rearrangement by domain wall number modulation in Fe3GeTe2. In particular, a strong correlation is uncovered in the reduction of domain wall number with the corresponding resistance decreasing by in&#8208;situ Lorentz transmission electron microscopy. Interestingly, the magnetic state is reversed instantly to the multi&#8208;domain wall state under a single pulse current with a higher amplitude, attributed to the rapid thermal demagnetization by simulation. Based on the neuromorphic computing system with full&#8208;current&#8208;driven artificial Fe3GeTe2 synapses with multi&#8208;state switching, a high accuracy of &#8776;91% is achieved in the handwriting image recognition pattern. The results identify 2D ferromagnet as an intriguing candidate for future advanced neuromorphic spintronics.

&lt;p&gt;The multi-output state of the resistance is acquired by a pure current strategy based on the manipulation of domain wall number by pulse current under zero magnetic field in the 2D ferromagnet Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;GeTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The multi-output properties can be utilized in the pattern recognition in the neuron computing trained by National Institute of Standards and Technology dataset.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Controlling the multi-state switching is significantly essential for the extensive utilization of 2D ferromagnet in magnetic racetrack memories, topological devices, and neuromorphic computing devices. The development of all-electric functional nanodevices with multi-state switching and a rapid reset remains challenging. Herein, to imitate the potentiation and depression process of biological synapses, a full-current strategy is unprecedently established by the controllable resistance-state switching originating from the spin configuration rearrangement by domain wall number modulation in Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;GeTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. In particular, a strong correlation is uncovered in the reduction of domain wall number with the corresponding resistance decreasing by in-situ Lorentz transmission electron microscopy. Interestingly, the magnetic state is reversed instantly to the multi-domain wall state under a single pulse current with a higher amplitude, attributed to the rapid thermal demagnetization by simulation. Based on the neuromorphic computing system with full-current-driven artificial Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;GeTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; synapses with multi-state switching, a high accuracy of &#8776;91% is achieved in the handwriting image recognition pattern. The results identify 2D ferromagnet as an intriguing candidate for future advanced neuromorphic spintronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Circularly Polarized Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Based on Chiral Hole Transport Enantiomers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of hole transport enantiomers are applied in fabrication of circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes first time with achiral luminescent materials as emitters, where the chiral hole transport enantiomers act as the organic circularly polarizers in principle. All devices exhibit symmetric circularly polarized electroluminescent spectra with dissymmetry factors ranging from 8.8 &#215; 10&#8722;4 to 3.6 &#215; 10&#8722;3.








Abstract
The circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) demonstrate promising application in 3D display due to the direct generation of circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL). But the chiral luminescence materials face challenges as intricated synthetic route, enantiomeric separation, etc. Herein, fresh CP&#8208;OLEDs are designed based on chiral hole transport material instead of chiral emitters. A pair of hole transport enantiomers (R/S&#8208;NPACZ) exhibit intense dissymmetry factors (|gPL|) about 5.0 &#215; 10&#8722;3. With R/S&#8208;NPACZ as hole transport layers, CP&#8208;OLEDs are fabricated employing six achiral phosphorescence and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials with different wavelengths, in consistence with the generated CPEL spectra. The CP&#8208;OLEDs based on achiral red, green, and blue iridium(III) complexes exhibit external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 14.9%, 30.7%, and 14.1% with |gEL| factors of 8.8 &#215; 10&#8722;4, 2.3 &#215; 10&#8722;3, and 2.0 &#215; 10&#8722;3, respectively. Moreover, the devices using achiral blue, blueish&#8208;green, and green TADF materials display EQEs of 24.1%, 17.9%, and 25.4% with |gEL| factors of 1.0 &#215; 10&#8722;3, 3.6 &#215; 10&#8722;3, and 2.2 &#215; 10&#8722;3, respectively. As far as known, it is the first example of CP&#8208;OLEDs based on chiral hole transport materials, which act as the organic circularly polarizers and have potential to generate CPEL from achiral luminescence materials.

         <title>The Unique Fe3Mo3N Structure Bestowed Efficient Fenton&#8208;Like Performance of the Iron&#8208;Based Catalysts: The Double Enhancement of Radicals and Nonradicals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of the unique Fe3Mo3N structure not only ensures efficient Fe cycle in Fenton&#8208;like process, but also promotes the production of various reactive species, especially nonradical pathways (such as electron transport process and Fe(IV)). The system has made remarkable progress in catalytic activity, multireaction mechanism system, adaptability, and catalytic sustainability.








Abstract
Iron&#8208;based catalysts are widely used in Fenton&#8208;like water pollution control technology due to their high efficiency, but their practical applications are limited by complex preparation conditions and strong blockage of Fe2+/Fe3+ cycle during the reaction. Here, a new iron&#8211;molybdenum bimetallic carbon&#8208;based catalyst is designed and synthesized using cellulose hydrogel for adsorption of Fe and Mo bimetals as a template, and the effective iron cycle in water treatment is realized. The integrated materials (Fe2.5Mo@CNs) with &#8220;catalytic/cocatalytic&#8221; performance have higher Fenton&#8208;like activation properties and universality than the equivalent quantity iron&#8211;carbon&#8208;based composite catalysts (Fe@CNs). Through the different characterization methods, experimental verifications and theoretical calculations show that the unique Fe3Mo3N structure promotes the adsorption of persulfate and reduces the energy barrier of the reaction, further completing the double enhancement of radicals (such as SO4&#183;&#8722;) and nonradicals (1O2 and electron transport process). The integrated &#8220;catalytic/cocatalytic&#8221; combined material is expected to provide a new promotion strategy for Fenton&#8208;like water pollution control.

         <title>Orderly Arranged Dipoles Regulate Anion&#8208;Derived Solid&#8211;Electrolyte Interphase for Stable Lithium Metal Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
After thermal reduction, BaTiO3 with surface oxygen vacancies (BTOV) exhibits stimulative adsorption and polarization for TFSI&#8722; and NO3&#8722; due to enhanced dipoles. With the BTOV on the polypropylene separator, a locally anion&#8208;rich and Li+&#8208;rich region is formed at the electrolyte&#8211;anode interface, which will promote the transport of Li+. Moreover, polarized anions are reduced promotively to form an expected SEI film.








Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal batteries are considered the most promising high&#8208;energy&#8208;density electrochemical energy storage devices of the next generation. However, the unstable solid&#8211;electrolyte interphase (SEI) derived from electrolytes usually leads to high impedance, Li dendrites growth, and poor cyclability. Herein, the ferroelectric BaTiO3 with orderly arranged dipoles (BTOV) is integrated into the polypropylene separator as a functional layer. Detailed characterizations and theoretical calculations indicate that surface oxygen vacancies drive the phase transition of BaTiO3 materials and promote the ordered arrangement of dipoles. The strong dipole moments in BTOV can adsorb TFSI&#8722; and NO3&#8722; anions selectively and promote their preferential reduction to form a SEI film enriched with inorganic LiF and LiNxOy species, thus facilitating the rapid transfer of Li+ and restraining the growth of Li dendrites. As a result, the Li&#8211;Li cell with the BTOV functional layer exhibits enhanced Li plating/stripping cycling with an ultra&#8208;long life of over 7000&#160;h at 0.5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2/1.0&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2. The LiFePO4 || Li (50&#160;&#181;m) full cells display excellent cycling performance exceeding 1760 cycles and superior rate performance. This work provides a new perspective for regulating SEI chemistry by introducing ordered dipoles to control the distribution and reaction of anions.

Noble metals have been widely used in catalysis, however, the scarcity and high cost of noble metal motivate researchers to balance the atomic efficiency and atomic density, which is formidably challenging. This article proposes a robust strategy for fabricating 3D amorphous noble metal&#8208;based oxides with simultaneous enhancement on atomic efficiency and density with the assistance of atomic channels, where the atomic utilization increases from 18.2% to 59.4%. The unique properties of amorphous bimetallic oxides and formation of atomic channels have been evidenced by detailed experimental characterizations and theoretical simulations. Moreover, the universality of the current strategy is validated by other binary oxides. When Cu2IrOx with atomic channels (Cu2IrOx&#8208;AE) is used as catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the mass activity and turnover frequency value of Cu2IrOx&#8208;AE are 1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude higher than CuO/IrO2 and Cu2IrOx without atomic channels, largely outperforming the reported OER catalysts. Theoretical calculations reveal that the formation of atomic channels leads to various Ir sites, on which the proton of adsorbed *OH can transfer to adjacent O atoms of [IrO6]. This work may attract immediate interest of researchers in material science, chemistry, catalysis, and beyond.

         <title>Steering CO2 Electroreduction to C2+ Products via Enhancing Localized *CO Coverage and Local Pressure in Conical Cavity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The successful construction of open and deep conical cavities (OD&#8208;CCs) imparts structural confinement to the catalysts, enabling concentrated carbon intermediates and facilitating smooth efflux of products along the curved sides. The nanosheet&#8208;stacked Cu2O sphere (NS&#8208;Cu2O) achieves an enhanced selectivity toward C2+ products with a maximum C2+ Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 81.7% at a partial current density of 286 mA cm&#8211;2.








Abstract
The electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction reaction (CO2RR) involves a multistep proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) process that generates a variety of intermediates, making it challenging to transform them into target products with high activity and selectivity. Here, a catalyst featuring a nanosheet&#8208;stacked sphere structure with numerous open and deep conical cavities (OD&#8208;CCs) is reported. Under the guidance of the finite&#8208;element method (FEM) simulations and theoretical analysis, it is shown that exerting control over the confinement space results in diffusion limitation of the carbon intermediates, thereby increasing local pressure and subsequently enhancing localized *CO coverage for dimerization. The nanocavities exhibit a structure&#8208;driven shift in selectivity of multicarbon (C2+) product from 41.8% to 81.7% during the CO2RR process.

         <title>Development of Inverse&#8208;Opal&#8208;Structured Charge&#8208;Deficient Co9S8@nitrogen&#8208;Doped&#8208;Carbon to Catalytically Enable High Energy and High Power for the Two&#8208;Electron Transfer I+/I&#8722; Electrode</title>

         <dc:description>
An inverse&#8208;opal&#8208;structured cobalt sulfide@nitrogen&#8208;doped&#8208;carbon (Co9S8@NC) is developed as a catalytic host of the iodine electrode, specifically targeting improved reaction kinetics for the two&#8208;electron transfer cascade reaction. The inherent charge&#8208;deficient nature of Co9S8@NC effectively lowers the activation energy required for the conversion reaction and enhances the physicochemical adsorption of active iodine species, leading to superior electrochemical performance even at sub&#8208;zero temperatures.








Abstract
The iodine (I) electrode involving two&#8208;electron transfer chemistry by converting between I+ and I&#8722;, has the potential to deliver theoretically doubled capacity and higher working voltage platforms, thus achieving higher energy density. However, owing to the slow kinetics of the cascade two&#8208;electron transfer reactions, the system suffers from large overpotentials and low power density, especially at high working currents and low temperatures. Here, an inverse&#8208;opal&#8208;structured cobalt sulfide@nitrogen&#8208;doped&#8208;carbon (Co9S8@NC) catalyst with unique charge&#8208;deficient states is developed to promote the reaction kinetics of the I&#8722;/I+ electrode. The charge&#8208;deficient Co9S8@NC catalyst not only enables strong physicochemical adsorption with the iodine species but also significantly reduces the activation energy and interfacial charge transfer resistance of the cascade I+/I0/I&#8722; conversion reaction. Consequently, the prototypical Zn&#8214;I+/I0/I&#8722; battery equipped with the Co9S8@NC catalyst can deliver a high energy density of 554 Wh kg&#8722;1 and a stable cycle life of 5000 cycles at 30&#160;&#176;C. Moreover, at a subzero temperature of &#8722;30 &#176;C, the battery can exhibit enhanced kinetics and a high power density of 1514 W kg&#8722;1, high energy density of 485 Wh kg&#8722;1.

         <title>Anchoring Charge Selective Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers for Tin&#8211;Lead Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The application of self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAMs) in perovskite solar cells has made the performance of p&#8211;i&#8211;n structure devices develop rapidly, while the relationship of function group, anchor groups, and spacers often is neglected. It is found that anchoring groups and spacers can affect the coordination between SAMs and perovskite. This work demonstrates different components of perovskites are selective to SAMs.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) have displayed great potential for improving efficiency and stability in p&#8211;i&#8211;n perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The anchoring of SAMs at the conductiv metal oxide substrates and their interaction with perovskite materials must be rationally tailored to ensure efficient charge carrier extraction and improved quality of the perovskite films. Herein, SAMs molecules with different anchoring groups and spacers to control the interaction with perovskite in the p&#8211;i&#8211;n mixed Sn&#8211;Pb PSCs are selected. It is found that the monolayer with the carboxylate group exhibits appropriate interaction and has a more favorable orientation and arrangement than that of the phosphate group. This results in reduced nonradiative recombination and enhanced crystallinity. In addition, the short chain length leads to an improved energy level alignment of SAMs with perovskite, improving hole extraction. As a result, the narrow bandgap (&#8776;1.25&#160;eV) Sn&#8211;Pb PSCs show efficiencies of up to 23.1% with an open&#8208;circuit voltage of up to 0.89&#160;V. Unencapsulated devices retain 93% of their initial efficiency after storage in N2 atmosphere for over 2500 h. Overall, this work highlights the underexplored potential of SAMs for perovskite photovoltaics and provides essential findings on the influence of their structural modification.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wearable sensor able to monitor in real time the subtlest changes of respiratory signals, associated with different daily activities as well as various symptoms of flu, is demonstrated. The device is based on hexagonal boron nitride inks made by non&#8208;covalent functionalization with pyrene derivatives, enabling to strongly enhance the sensitivity to water molecules, and device stability.








Abstract
Wearable humidity sensors are attracting strong attention as they allow for real&#8208;time and continuous monitoring of important physiological information by enabling activity tracking as well as air quality assessment. Amongst 2Dimensional (2D) materials, graphene oxide (GO) is very attractive for humidity sensing due to its tuneable surface chemistry, high surface area, processability in water, and easy integration onto flexible substrates. However, strong hysteresis, low sensitivity, and cross&#8208;sensitivity issues limit the use of GO in practical applications, where continuous monitoring is preferred. Herein, a wearable and wireless impedance&#8208;based humidity sensor made with pyrene&#8208;functionalized hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) nanosheets is demonstrated. The device shows enhanced sensitivity towards relative humidity (RH) (&gt;1010 Ohms/%RH in the range from 5% to 100% RH), fast response (0.1&#160;ms), no appreciable hysteresis, and no cross&#8208;sensitivity with temperature&#160;in the range of 25&#8211;60 &#176;C. The h&#8208;BN&#8208;based sensor is able to monitor the whole breathing cycle process of exhaling and inhaling, hence enabling to record in real&#8208;time the subtlest changes of respiratory signals associated with different daily activities as well as various symptoms of flu, without requiring any direct contact with the individual.

         <title>Mechanical Stimulation of Anti&#8208;Inflammatory and Antioxidant Hydrogels for Rapid Re&#8208;Epithelialization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrogel with natural anti&#8208;inflammatory and antioxidant properties is reported. The hydrogel possesses outstanding mechanical properties and can be further enhanced by water. In a long urethral injury model in vivo, and the hydrogels achieve effective functional replacement and ultimately accurate remodeling of the epithelium combining mechanical stimulation and immunoregulation.








Abstract
The epithelium, an essential barrier to protect organisms against infection, exists in many organs. However, rapid re&#8208;epithelialization to restore tissue integrity and function in an adverse environment is challenging. In this work, a long&#8208;term anti&#8208;inflammatory and antioxidant hydrogel with mechanical stimulation for rapid re&#8208;epithelialization, mainly composed of the small molecule thioctic acid, biocompatible glycine, and &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 nanoparticles is reported. Glycine&#8208;modified supramolecular thioctic acid is stable and possesses outstanding mechanical properties. The incorporating &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 providing the potential contrast function for magnetic resonance imaging observation, can propel hydrogel reconfiguration to enhance the mechanical properties of the hydrogel underwater due to water&#8208;initiated release of Fe3+. In vitro experiments show that the hydrogels effectively reduced intracellular reactive oxygen species, guided macrophages toward M2 polarization, and alleviated inflammation. The effect of rapid re&#8208;epithelialization is ultimately demonstrated in a long urethral injury model in vivo, and the mechanical stimulation of hydrogels achieves effective functional replacement and ultimately accurate remodeling of the epithelium. Notably, the proposed strategy provides an advanced alternative treatment for patients in need of large&#8208;area epithelial reconstruction.

         <title>Amorphous MnO2 Lamellae Encapsulated Covalent Triazine Polymer&#8208;Derived Multi&#8208;Heteroatoms&#8208;Doped Carbon for ORR/OER Bifunctional Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amorphous MnO2 lamellae encapsulated N, S, P co&#8208;doped carbon sphere (A&#8208;MnO2/NSPC) is fabricated through a self&#8208;doping process coupled with in situ encapsulating strategy. Due to the predesigned amorphous MnO2 surface defects and the abundance of multi&#8208;heteroatom catalytic active sites, the as&#8208;developed A&#8208;MnO2/NSPC can readily work as an oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen evolution reaction dual&#8208;functional electrocatalyst for both liquid and solid rechargeable zinc&#8208;air battery.








Abstract
The intelligent construction of non&#8208;noble metal materials that exhibit reversible oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with bifunctional electrocatalytic performance is greatly coveted in the realm of zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs). Herein, a crafted structure&#8208;amorphous MnO2 lamellae encapsulated covalent triazine polymer&#8208;derived N, S, P co&#8208;doped carbon sphere (A&#8208;MnO2/NSPC) is designed using a self&#8208;doped pyrolysis coupled with an in situ encapsulation strategy. The customized A&#8208;MnO2/NSPC&#8208;2 demonstrates a superior bifunctional electrocatalytic performance, confirmed by a small &#916;E index of 0.64&#160;V for ORR/OER. Experimental investigations, along with density functional theory calculations validate that predesigned amorphous MnO2 surface defects and abundant heteroatom catalytic active sites collectively enhance the oxygen electrocatalytic performance. Impressively, the A&#8208;MnO2/NSPC&#8208;based rechargeable liquid ZABs show a large open&#8208;circuit potential of 1.54&#160;V, an ultrahigh peak power density of 181&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, an enormous capacity of 816 mAh g&#8722;1, and a remarkable stability for more than 1720 discharging/charging cycles. Additionally, the assembled flexible all&#8208;solid&#8208;state ZABs also demonstrate outstanding cycle stability, surpassing 140 discharging/charging cycles. Therefore, this highly operable synthetic strategy offers substantial understanding in the development of magnificent bifunctional electrocatalysts for various sustainable energy conversions and beyond.

         <title>Multiple Cations Nanoconfinement in Ultrathin V2O5 Nanosheets Enables Ultrafast Ion Diffusion Kinetics Toward High&#8208;performance Zinc Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general, supramolecular&#160;self&#8208;assembly strategy is developed to intercalate unitary cation including NH4+, Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Zn2+, Al3+ and multiple cations (NH4+ + Na+, NH4+ + Na+ + Ca2+, NH4+ + Na+ + Ca2+ + Mg2+) in ultrathin V2O5 nanosheets. The success on multiple cations nanoconfinement enables very fast zinc ion diffusion kinetics and excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability. The optimized diffusion coefficient of zinc ion (7.5&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;8 cm2 s&#8722;1) in this assembly series surpasses most of the V&#8208;based cathodes reported up to date.








Abstract
Nanoconfinement of cations in layered oxide cathode is an important approach to realize advanced zinc ion storage performance. However, thus far, the conventional hydrothermal/solvothermal route for this nanoconfinement has been restricted to its uncontrollable phase structure and the difficulty on the multiple cation co&#8208;confinement simultaneously. Herein, this work reports a general, supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of ultrathin V2O5 nanosheets using various unitary cations including Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Zn2+, Al3+, NH4+, and multiple cations (NH4+ + Na+, NH4+ + Na+ + Ca2+, NH4+ + Na+ + Ca2+ +Mg2+). The unitary cation confinement results in a remarkable increase in the specific capacity and Zn&#8208;ion diffusion kinetics, and the multiple cation confinement gives rise to superior structural and cycling stability by multiple cation synergetic pillaring effect. The optimized diffusion coefficient of Zn&#8208;ion (7.5 &#215; 10&#8722;8 cm2 s&#8722;1) in this assembly series surpasses most of the V&#8208;based cathodes reported up to date. The work develops a novel multiple&#8208;cations nanoconfinement strategy toward high&#8208;performance cathode for aqueous battery. It also provides new insights into the guest cation regulation of zinc&#8208;ion diffusion kinetics through a general, supramolecular assembly pathway.

         <title>Microencapsulated Perovskite Crystals via In Situ Permeation Growth from Polymer Microencapsulation&#8208;Expansion&#8208;Contraction Strategy: Advancing a Record Long&#8208;Term Stability beyond 10&#160;000 h for Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

Microencapsulation of PbI2 and perovskite crystals with the in situ polymerized poly(4&#8208;acryloylmorpholine) (poly(4&#8208;AcM)): this novel strategy modulates the PbI2&#8208;ammonium salt reaction through poly(4&#8208;AcM) microencapsulation&#8208;expansion&#8208;contraction behavior. The resultant decelerated crystallization rate fosters high&#8208;quality perovskite film formation, achieving a notable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 24.04%. Remarkably, after 13 008 h in dry storage, the PCE impressively retains 91% of its initial efficiency.








Abstract
Organic metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) bearing both high efficiency and durability are predominantly challenged by inadequate crystallinity of perovskite. Herein, a polymer microencapsulation&#8208;expansion&#8208;contraction strategy is proposed for the first time to optimize the crystallization behavior of perovskite, typically by adeptly harnessing the swelling and deswelling characteristics of poly(4&#8208;acryloylmorpholine) (poly(4&#8208;AcM)) network on PbI2 surface. It can effectively retard the crystallization rate of perovskite, permitting meliorative crystallinity featured by increased grain size from 0.74 to 1.32&#160;&#181;m and reduced trap density from 1.12 &#215; 1016 to 2.56 &#215; 1015 cm&#8722;3. Moreover, profiting from the protection of poly(4&#8208;AcM) microencapsulation layer, the degradation of the perovskite is markedly suppressed. Resultant PSCs gain a robust power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.04%. Typically, they maintain 91% of their initial PCE for 13&#160;008 h in a desiccated ambient environment and retain 92% PCE after storage for 4000 h with a relative humidity of 50 &#177; 10%, which is the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art long&#8208;term stability among the reported contributions.

         <title>Piezoionic Elastomers by Phase and Interface Engineering for High&#8208;Performance Energy&#8208;Harvesting Ionotronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study presents phase and interface engineering to design piezoionic elastomers with integrated microphase&#8208;separated structures and an intermediate phase. It addresses the significant challenges associated with harmonizing the structural requirements for voltage generation, current conduction, and mechanical adaptability in piezoionic and piezoelectric materials, which are crucial for energy&#8208;harvesting ionotronics and human&#8211;machine interaction.








Abstract
Piezoionic materials play a pivotal role in energy&#8208;harvesting ionotronics. However, a persistent challenge lies in balancing the structural requirements for voltage generation, current conduction, and mechanical adaptability. The conventional approach of employing crystalline heterostructures for stress concentration and localized charge separation, while effective for voltage generation, often compromises the stretchability and long&#8208;range charge transport found in homogeneous quasisolid states. Herein, phase and interface engineering strategy is introduced to address this dilemma and a piezoionic elastomer is presented that seamlessly integrates ionic liquids and ionic plastic crystals, forming a finely tuned microphase&#8208;separated structure with an intermediate phase. This approach promotes charge separation via stress concentration among hard phases while leveraging the high ionic charge mobility in soft and intermediate phases. Impressively, the elastomer achieves an extraordinary piezoionic coefficient of about 6.0&#160;mV kPa&#8722;1, a more than threefold improvement over current hydrogels and ionogels. The resulting power density of 1.3 &#181;W cm&#8722;3 sets a new benchmark, exceeding that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art piezoionic gels. Notably, this elastomer combines outstanding stretchability, remarkable toughness, and rapid self&#8208;healing capability, underscoring its potential for real&#8208;world applications. This work may represent a stride toward mechanically robust energy harvesting systems and provide insights into ionotronic systems for human&#8211;machine interaction.

         <title>Tunable Hydrogel Electronics for Diagnosis of Peripheral Neuropathy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
On&#8208;skin patches with polyaspartic acid&#8208;modified dopamine/ethyl&#8208;based ionic liquid hydrogel (PDEH) are developed to capture electromyography signals for the diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy. Triggered by a one&#8208;step electric field treatment, the hydrogel realizes rapid, wide&#8208;range adhesion regulation, and enhanced mechanical performance. In clinical applications, the PDEH&#8208;SLM (silver&#8208;liquid metal) devices can establish intimate device/skin interfaces or ensure benign removal while achieving precise diagnoses of nerve injuries.








Abstract
Peripheral neuropathy characterized by rapidly increasing numbers of patients is commonly diagnosed via analyzing electromyography signals obtained from stimulation&#8208;recording devices. However, existing commercial electrodes have difficulty in implementing conformal contact with skin and gentle detachment, dramatically impairing stimulation/recording performances. Here, this work develops on&#8208;skin patches with polyaspartic acid&#8208;modified dopamine/ethyl&#8208;based ionic liquid hydrogel (PDEH) as stimulation/recording devices to capture electromyography signals for the diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy. Triggered by a one&#8208;step electric field treatment, the hydrogel achieves rapid and wide&#8208;range regulation of adhesion and substantially strengthened mechanical performances. Moreover, hydrogel patches assembled with a silver&#8208;liquid metal (SLM) layer exhibit superior charge injection and low contact impedance, capable of capturing high&#8208;fidelity electromyography. This work further verifies the feasibility of hydrogel devices for accurate diagnoses of peripheral neuropathy in sensory, motor, and mixed nerves. For various body parts, such as fingers, the elderly's loose skin, hairy skin, and children's fragile skin, this work regulates the adhesion of PDEH&#8208;SLM devices to establish intimate device/skin interfaces or ensure benign removal. Noticeably, hydrogel patches achieve precise diagnoses of nerve injuries in these clinical cases while providing extra advantages of more effective stimulation/recording performances. These patches offer a promising alternative for the diagnosis and rehabilitation of neuropathy in future.

         <title>Control of Charge&#8208;Spin Interconversion in van der Waals Heterostructures with Chiral Charge Density Waves</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented tunable charge&#8208;spin interconversion (CSI) is observed in graphene/1T&#8208;TaS2 van der Waals heterostructures by manipulating the charge density wave (CDW) phases in 1T&#8208;TaS2. The output of one of the CSI components switches off with the commensurability of the CDW phases. First&#8208;principles calculations support that chiral CDW multidomains in the heterostructure are at the origin of the switching of CSI.








Abstract
A charge density wave (CDW) represents an exotic state in which electrons are arranged in a long&#8208;range ordered pattern in low&#8208;dimensional materials. Although the understanding of the fundamental character of CDW is enriched after extensive studies, its practical application remains limited. Here, an unprecedented demonstration of a tunable charge&#8208;spin interconversion (CSI) in graphene/1T&#8208;TaS2 van der Waals heterostructures is shown by manipulating the distinct CDW phases in 1T&#8208;TaS2. Whereas CSI from spins polarized in all three directions is observed in the heterostructure when the CDW phase does not show commensurability, the output of one of the components disappears, and the other two are enhanced when the CDW phase becomes commensurate. The experimental observation is supported by first&#8208;principles calculations, which evidence that chiral CDW multidomains in the heterostructure are at the origin of the switching of CSI. The results uncover a new approach for on&#8208;demand CSI in low&#8208;dimensional systems, paving the way for advanced spin&#8208;orbitronic devices.

         <title>Hot&#8208;Carrier Cooling Regulation for Mixed Sn&#8208;Pb Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tin(II) oxalate as a substitute for tin(II) fluoride is used to regulate the hot carrier cooling kinetics, increase the carrier diffusion length, and prolong the carrier lifetime. Based on this strategy, the champion efficiencies of mixed Sn&#8208;Pb and all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells are 23.36% and 27.56%, accompanied by significantly improved long&#8208;term stability.








Abstract
The rapid relaxation of hot carriers leads to energy loss in the form of heat and consequently restricts the theoretical efficiency of single&#8208;junction solar cells; However, this issue has not received much attention in tin&#8208;lead perovskites solar cells. Herein, tin(II) oxalate (SnC2O4) is introduced into tin&#8208;lead perovskite precursor solution to regulate hot&#8208;carrier cooling dynamics. The addition of SnC2O4 increases the length of carrier diffusion, extends the lifetime of carriers, and simultaneously slows down the cooling rate of carriers. Furthermore, SnC2O4 can bond with uncoordinated Sn2+ and Pb2+ ions to regulate the crystallization of perovskite and enable large grains. The strongly reducing properties of the C2O42&#8722; can inhibit the oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ and minimize the formation of Sn vacancies in the resulting perovskite films. Additionally, as a substitute for tin(II) fluoride, the introduction of SnC2O4 avoids the carrier transport issues caused by the aggregation of F&#8211; ions at the interface. As a result, the SnC2O4&#8208;treated Sn&#8208;Pb cells show a champion efficiency of 23.36%, as well as 27.56% for the all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells. Moreover, the SnC2O4&#8208;treated devices show excellent long&#8208;term stability. This finding is expected to pave the way toward stable and highly efficient all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells.

         <title>Impact of Electrostatic Interaction on Vertical Morphology and Energy Loss in Efficient Pseudo&#8208;Planar Heterojunction Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A relationship between the molecular structure and the vertical phase separation (VPS) morphology of PPHJ OSCs by using molecular surface electrostatic potential (ESP) as a bridge is first established. A ternary PPHJ device with an appropriate &#8710;ESP is elaborately constructed to achieve better VPS morphology and lower &#916;E3, resulting in impressive efficiency of 19.09%.








Abstract
Although a suitable vertical phase separation (VPS) morphology is essential for improving charge transport efficiency, reducing charge recombination, and ultimately boosting the efficiency of organic solar cells (OSCs), there is a lack of theoretical guidance on how to achieve the ideal morphology. Herein, a relationship between the molecular structure and the VPS morphology of pseudo&#8208;planar heterojunction (PPHJ) OSCs is established by using molecular surface electrostatic potential (ESP) as a bridge. The morphological evolution mechanism is revealed by studying four binary systems with vary electrostatic potential difference (&#8710;ESP) between donors (Ds) and acceptors (As). The findings manifest that as &#8710;ESP increases, the active layer is more likely to form a well&#8208;mixed phase, while a smaller &#8710;ESP favors VPS morphology. Interestingly, it is also observed that a larger &#8710;ESP leads to enhanced miscibility between Ds and As, resulting in higher non&#8208;radiative energy losses (&#916;E3). Based on these discoveries, a ternary PPHJ device is meticulously designed with an appropriate &#8710;ESP to obtain better VPS morphology and lower &#916;E3, and an impressive efficiency of 19.09% is achieved. This work demonstrates that by optimizing the &#916;ESP, not only the formation of VPS morphology can be controlled, but also energy losses can be reduced, paving the way to further boost OSC performance.

CD93&#8208;Targeted Microbubbles
In article number 2310421, Qiuyang Li, Lijun Yuan, and co&#8208;workers develop a novel ultrasound contrast microbubble for evaluation of immune status through molecular imaging of endothelial CD93 expression. High levels of CD93 in tumor vasculature correlate well with immune cell infiltration deficiency, and ultrasound imaging of CD93 with MMRN2&#8208;modified microbubbles holds as a promising strategy to assess the anti&#8208;tumor immune response.

On&#8208;Skin Electronics
In article number 2308831, Hao Wu, Yutian Liu, and co&#8208;workers develop on&#8208;skin patches with polyaspartic acid&#8208;modified dopamine/ethyl&#8208;based ionic liquid hydrogel to capture electromyography signals. Triggered by a one&#8208;step electric field treatment, the hydrogel realizes rapid, wide&#8208;range adhesion regulation and enhanced mechanical performance. Hydrogel devices can establish intimate device/skin interfaces or ensure benign removal while achieving precise diagnoses of nerve injuries.

Microrobots
In article number 2310084, Salvador Pan&#233;, Minsoo Kim, Hao Ye, and co&#8208;workers introduce microrobotic superstructures comprising a magnetic gelatin composite chassis threaded with iron helical micromachines. Magnetic inputs can be used to navigate the superstructure (gradients) and also dissolve the chassis through magnetic hyperthermia, thereby releasing the micromachines to navigate through narrow channels. The capability of these micromachines to disassemble on&#8208;command to access narrower conduits enhances the microrobots' multifunctionality.

Organ&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip devices have been extensively developed as potentially transformative in vitro models to recapitulate sophisticated architectures and dynamic microenvironments of human organs. The latest developments toward intelligent organ&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip systems where sensing, data processing, and modulating units are integrated and coordinated to fine&#8208;tune the in vitro models and offer holistic biomedical insights for diverse applications are reviewed.








Abstract
In vitro models are essential to a broad range of biomedical research, such as pathological studies,&#160;drug development, and personalized medicine. As a potentially transformative paradigm for 3D in vitro models, organ&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip (OOC) technology has been extensively developed to recapitulate sophisticated architectures and dynamic microenvironments of human organs by applying the principles of life sciences and leveraging micro&#8208; and nanoscale engineering capabilities. A pivotal function of OOC devices is to support multifaceted and timely characterization&#160;of cultured cells&#160;and their microenvironments. However, in&#8208;depth analysis of OOC models&#160;typically requires biomedical assay procedures that are labor&#8208;intensive and interruptive. Herein,&#160;the latest advances toward intelligent OOC (iOOC) systems, where sensors integrated with OOC devices continuously report cellular and microenvironmental information for comprehensive in situ bioanalysis, are examined. It is proposed that the multimodal data in iOOC systems can support closed&#8208;loop control of the in vitro&#160;models and offer holistic biomedical insights for diverse applications. Essential techniques for establishing iOOC systems are surveyed, encompassing in situ sensing, data processing, and dynamic modulation. Eventually, the future development of iOOC systems featuring cross&#8208;disciplinary strategies is discussed.

&lt;p&gt;In vitro models are essential to a broad range of biomedical research, such as pathological studies,&#160;drug development, and personalized medicine. As a potentially transformative paradigm for 3D in vitro models, organ-on-a-chip (OOC) technology has been extensively developed to recapitulate sophisticated architectures and dynamic microenvironments of human organs by applying the principles of life sciences and leveraging micro- and nanoscale engineering capabilities. A pivotal function of OOC devices is to support multifaceted and timely characterization&#160;of cultured cells&#160;and their microenvironments. However, in-depth analysis of OOC models&#160;typically requires biomedical assay procedures that are labor-intensive and interruptive. Herein,&#160;the latest advances toward intelligent OOC (iOOC) systems, where sensors integrated with OOC devices continuously report cellular and microenvironmental information for comprehensive in situ bioanalysis, are examined. It is proposed that the multimodal data in iOOC systems can support closed-loop control of the in vitro&#160;models and offer holistic biomedical insights for diverse applications. Essential techniques for establishing iOOC systems are surveyed, encompassing in situ sensing, data processing, and dynamic modulation. Eventually, the future development of iOOC systems featuring cross-disciplinary strategies is discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Towards Negative Emissions: Hydrothermal Carbonization of Biomass for Sustainable Carbon Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon materials from hydrothermal carbonization of biomass have great potential for carbon emission reduction. This review covers the fundamental properties of biomass and the hydrothermal environment, the intrinsic mechanisms and regulation methods of biomass hydrothermal carbonization, the wide range of applications of derived carbon materials, and the sustainability potential of carbon materials.








Abstract
The contemporary production of carbon materials heavily relies on fossil fuels, contributing significantly to the greenhouse effect. Biomass is a carbon&#8208;neutral resource whose organic carbon is formed from atmospheric CO2. Employing biomass as a precursor for synthetic carbon materials can fix atmospheric CO2 into solid materials, achieving negative carbon emissions. Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) presents an attractive method for converting biomass into carbon materials, by which biomass can be transformed into materials with favorable properties in a distinct hydrothermal environment, and these carbon materials have made extensive progress in many fields. However, the HTC of biomass is a complex and interdisciplinary problem, involving simultaneously the physical properties of the underlying biomass and sub/supercritical water, the chemical mechanisms of hydrothermal synthesis, diverse applications of resulting carbon materials, and the sustainability of the entire technological routes. This review starts with the analysis of biomass composition and distinctive characteristics of the hydrothermal environment. Then, the factors influencing the HTC of biomass, the reaction mechanism, and the properties of resulting carbon materials are discussed in depth, especially the different formation mechanisms of primary and secondary hydrochars. Furthermore, the application and sustainability of biomass&#8208;derived carbon materials are summarized, and some insights into future directions are provided.

         <title>Mechanically Strengthened Aerogels through Multiscale, Multicompositional, and Multidimensional Approaches: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
It has already been &#8776;90 years since the first development of aerogels, and many researchers have devoted tremendous efforts to enhance&#160;their mechanical properties, which is yet completely achieved. This review presents multiscale, multicompositional and multidimensional strategies, resulting from flexible synthesis techniques for 0D&#8211;1D, 0D&#8211;2D, 1D&#8211;2D, and 0D&#8211;1D&#8211;2D combined aerogels.








Abstract
In recent decades, aerogels have attracted tremendous&#160;attention&#160;in academia and industry as a class of lightweight and porous multifunctional nanomaterial. Despite their wide application range, the low mechanical&#160;durability hinders their processing and handling, particularly in applications requiring complex physical structures. &#8220;Mechanically strengthened aerogels&#8221; have emerged as a potential solution to address this drawback. Since the first report on aerogels in 1931, various modified synthesis processes have been introduced in the last few decades to enhance the aerogel mechanical strength, further advancing their multifunctional scope. This review summarizes the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art developments of mechanically strengthened aerogels through multicompositional and multidimensional approaches. Furthermore, new trends and future directions for&#160;as&#160;prevailed commercialization of aerogels as plastic materials are discussed.

         <title>Revitalizing Ancient Mitochondria with Nano&#8208;Strategies: Mitochondria&#8208;Remedying Nanodrugs Concentrate on Disease Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mitochondrial quality decrease, oxidative stress, Ca2+ dyshomeostasis, and inflammation are the major features of multiple types of diseases of mitochondrial damage. Mitochodnria&#8208;remedying nanodrugs with different characteristics and remarkable brilliance are committed to ameliorating various diseases by rescuing mitochondria via repairing mitochondrial quality, protecting mitochondria from oxidative stress, inhibiting mPTP and inflammation response and mitochondrial bionics.








Abstract
Mitochondria, widely known as the energy factories of eukaryotic cells, have a myriad of vital functions across diverse cellular processes. Dysfunctions within mitochondria serve as catalysts for various diseases, prompting widespread cellular demise. Mounting research on remedying damaged mitochondria indicates that mitochondria constitute a valuable target for therapeutic intervention against diseases. But the less clinical practice and lower recovery rate imply the limitation of traditional drugs, which need a further breakthrough. Nanotechnology has approached favorable regiospecific biodistribution and high efficacy by capitalizing on excellent nanomaterials and targeting drug delivery. Mitochondria&#8208;remedying nanodrugs have achieved ideal therapeutic effects. This review elucidates the significance of mitochondria in various cells and organs, while also compiling mortality data for related diseases. Correspondingly, nanodrug&#8208;mediate therapeutic strategies and applicable mitochondria&#8208;remedying nanodrugs in disease are detailed, with a full understanding of the roles of mitochondria dysfunction and the advantages of nanodrugs. In addition, the future challenges and directions are widely discussed. In conclusion, this review provides comprehensive insights into the design and development of mitochondria&#8208;remedying nanodrugs, aiming to help scientists who desire to extend their research fields and engage in this interdisciplinary subject.

         <title>A Holistic Review of C = C Crosslinkable Conjugated Molecules in Solution&#8208;Processed Organic Electronics: Insights into Stability, Processibility, and Mechanical Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The C = C Cross&#8208;linking strategy is an effective tool to improve the chem&#8208;physic, optoelectronic, and soluton&#8208;processing capacities of organic conjugated molecules (OCMs) for optoelectronic applications. This review mainly describes the structural type, characterization method, and unique property of the C = C cross&#8208;linking OCMs system, and further summarizes their application in the field of organic optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processable organic conjugated molecules (OCMs) consist of a series of aromatic units linked by &#963;&#8208;bonds, which present a relatively freedom intramolecular motion and intermolecular re&#8208;arrangement under external stimulation. The cross&#8208;linked strategy provides an effective platform to obtain OCMs network, which allows for outstanding optoelectronic, excellent physicochemical properties, and substantial improvement in device fabrication. An unsaturated double carbon&#8211;carbon bond (C = C) is universal segment to construct crosslinkable OCMs. In this review, the authors will set C = C cross&#8208;linkable units as an example to summarize the development of cross&#8208;linkable OCMs for solution&#8208;processable optoelectronic applications. First, this review provides a comprehensive overview of the distinctive chemical, physical, and optoelectronic properties arising from the cross&#8208;linking strategies employed in OCMs. Second, the methods for probing the C = C cross&#8208;linking reaction are also emphasized based on the perturbations of chemical structure and physicochemical property. Third, a series of model C = C cross&#8208;linkable units, including styrene, trifluoroethylene, and unsaturated acid ester, are further discussed to design and prepare novel OCMs. Furthermore, a concise overview of the optoelectronic applications associated with this approach is presented, including light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), solar cells (SCs), and field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs). Lastly, the authors offer a concluding perspective and outlook for the improvement of OCMs and their optoelectronic application via the cross&#8208;linking strategy.

The rational construction and microenvironment regulation of interlayer nanochannels are of vital importance for the realization of efficient ion separation and storage. This review systematically summarizes the interlayer engineering strategies of layered materials and discusses their effects on ion separation and storage, which provide guidance for designing high&#8208;performance separation membranes and battery electrodes.








Abstract
Layered materials are characterized by strong in&#8208;plane covalent chemical bonds within each atomic layer and weak out&#8208;of&#8208;plane van der Waals (vdW) interactions between adjacent layers. The non&#8208;bonding nature between neighboring layers naturally results in a vdW gap, which enables the insertion of guest species into the interlayer gap. Rational design and regulation of interlayer nanochannels are crucial for converting these layered materials and their 2D derivatives into ion separation membranes or battery electrodes. Herein, based on the latest progress in layered materials and their derivative nanosheets, various interlayer engineering methods are briefly introduced, along with the effects of intercalated species on the crystal structure and interlayer coupling of the host layered materials. Their applications in the ion separation and energy storage fields are then summarized, with a focus on interlayer engineering to improve selective ion transport and ion storage performance. Finally, future research opportunities and challenges in this emerging field are comprehensively discussed.

Versatile nitrogen&#8208;centered redox&#8208;active organic materials, including electrochemical performance and reaction mechanism, are discussed individually. The challenges, solutions, and perspectives are also proposed in this review.








Abstract
Versatile nitrogen&#8208;centered organic redox&#8208;active molecules have gained significant attention in alkali metal&#8208;ion batteries (AMIBs) due to their low cost, low toxicity, and ease of preparation. Specially, their multiple reaction categories (anion/cation insertion types of reaction) and higher operating voltage, when compared to traditional conjugated carbonyl materials, underscore their promising prospects. However, the high solubility of nitrogen&#8208;centered redox active materials in organic electrolyte and their low electronic conductivity contribute to inferior cycling performance, sluggish reaction kinetics, and limited rate capability. This review provides a detailed overview of nitrogen&#8208;centered redox&#8208;active materials, encompassing their redox chemistry, solutions to overcome shortcomings, characterization of charge storage mechanisms, and recent progress. Additionally, prospects and directions are proposed for future investigations. It is anticipated that this review will stimulate further exploration of underlying mechanisms and interface chemistry through in situ characterization techniques, thereby promoting the practical application of nitrogen&#8208;centered redox&#8208;active materials in AMIBs.

         <title>Enhancing Purely Organic Room Temperature Phosphorescence via Supramolecular Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive review of purely organic room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) via supramolecular self&#8208;assembly is presented. RTP can be achieved by small molecular self&#8208;assembly, cocrystal, the self&#8208;assembly of macrocyclic host and guest, and multi&#8208;stage supramolecular self&#8208;assembly. The constructions, RTP properties, and applications of supramolecular assembly systems are discussed in detail. This review lays the foundation for developing RTP supramolecular materials.








Abstract
Long&#8208;lived and highly efficient room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials are in high demand for practical applications in lighting and display, security signboards, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. Achieving RTP in aqueous solutions, near&#8208;infrared (NIR) phosphorescence emission, and NIR&#8208;excited RTP are crucial for applications in bio&#8208;imaging, but these goals pose significant challenges. Supramolecular self&#8208;assembly provides an effective strategy to address the above problems. This review focuses on the recent advances in the enhancement of RTP via supramolecular self&#8208;assembly, covering four key aspects: small molecular self&#8208;assembly, cocrystals, the self&#8208;assembly of macrocyclic hosts and guests, and multi&#8208;stage supramolecular self&#8208;assembly. This review not only highlights progress in these areas but also underscores the prominent challenges associated with developing supramolecular RTP materials. The resulting strategies for the development of high&#8208;performance supramolecular RTP materials are discussed, aiming to satisfy the practical applications of RTP materials in biomedical science.

         <title>Expanding the Horizons of Machine Learning in Nanomaterials to Chiral Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review analyzes machine learning methods for studying achiral nanomaterials and offers guidance for adapting and extending this work to chiral nanomaterials. An overview of chiral nanomaterials in the context of synthesis&#8208;structure&#8211;property&#8211;application relationships is presented, offering insights on leveraging machine learning for these complex relationships. Key achievements, challenges, and outlook for machine learning in chiral nanomaterials research are discussed.








Abstract
Machine learning holds significant research potential in the field of nanotechnology, enabling nanomaterial structure and property predictions, facilitating materials design and discovery, and reducing the need for time&#8208;consuming and labor&#8208;intensive experiments and simulations.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Machine learning holds significant research potential in the field of nanotechnology, enabling nanomaterial structure and property predictions, facilitating materials design and discovery, and reducing the need for time-consuming and labor-intensive experiments and simulations. In contrast to their achiral counterparts, the application of machine learning for chiral nanomaterials is still in its infancy, with a limited number of publications to date. This is despite the great potential of machine learning to advance the development of new sustainable chiral materials with high values of optical activity, circularly polarized luminescence, and enantioselectivity, as well as for the analysis of structural chirality by electron microscopy. In this review, an analysis of machine learning methods used for studying achiral nanomaterials is provided, subsequently offering guidance on adapting and extending this work to chiral nanomaterials. An overview of chiral nanomaterials within the framework of synthesis&#8211;structure&#8211;property&#8211;application relationships is presented and insights on how to leverage machine learning for the study of these highly complex relationships are provided. Some key recent publications are reviewed and discussed on the application of machine learning for chiral nanomaterials. Finally, the review captures the key achievements, ongoing challenges, and the prospective outlook for this very important research field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
