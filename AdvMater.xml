      <title>Mechanical and Tribological Performances Enhanced by Self&#8208;Assembled Structures</title>
      <dc:description>
Inspired by nacre and bones, an effective fabrication method for enhancing the mechanical and tribological performances of self&#8208;assembled structures is reported via two strategies. First, a progressive interfacial sliding resistance is thought to be a source of strength and deformation hardening. Second, regulating the building blocks with an amorphous microstructure means they are harder and tougher than those that are single crystalline.








Abstract
Taking inspiration from natural materials, composite materials can be reinforced by creating matrix architectures that can better accommodate and control internal stresses. Despite the recent success in the synthesis of artificial assemblies for local reinforcement through the introduction of oriented fibers and plates into host multilayered composites, there is a lack of fundamental understanding of the factors that determine mechanical properties. Moreover, designing building blocks and interfaces that facilitate higher resistance and energy dissipation is highly challenging. When the intrinsic material is fixed, the mechanical and tribological properties can be further adjusted. In this study, europium oxide nanosheets are arranged in interlocked&#8208;junction superstructures that resist sliding at junction points, thereby enhancing the mechanical properties of the nanosheet assemblies compared to those of the conventional face&#8208;to&#8208;face superstructures formed by parallel nanosheets. Furthermore, the crystalline origin of building blocks is revealed by demonstrating that faulty crystal nanosheets adopting an amorphous structure are different from single&#8208;crystal nanosheets, with the former exhibiting superior mechanical reinforcement and improved abrasive resistance.

      <title>The Bulk Heterojunction in Organic Photovoltaic, Photodetector, and Photocatalytic Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
The development of the bulk heterojunction, in terms of materials design, device engineering, and the underpinning physical understanding, has led to significant improvements in organic photovoltaics. Looking forward, the bulk heterojunction concept is likely to allow even greater solar cell efficiencies and interestingly, can be applied to other organic electronic applications, such as organic photodetectors and photocatalysts.








Abstract
Organic semiconductors require an energetic offset in order to photogenerate free charge carriers efficiently, owing to their inability to effectively screen charges. This is vitally important in order to achieve high power conversion efficiencies in organic solar cells. Early heterojunction&#8208;based solar cells were limited to relatively modest efficiencies (&lt;4%) owing to limitations such as poor exciton dissociation, limited photon harvesting, and high recombination losses. The development of the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) has significantly overcome these issues, resulting in dramatic improvements in organic photovoltaic performance, now exceeding 18% power conversion efficiencies. Here, the design and engineering strategies used to develop the optimal bulk heterojunction for solar&#8208;cell, photodetector, and photocatalytic applications are discussed. Additionally, the thermodynamic driving forces in the creation and stability of the bulk heterojunction are presented, along with underlying photophysics in these blends. Finally, new opportunities to apply the knowledge accrued from BHJ solar cells to generate free charges for use in promising new applications are discussed.

      <title>Van Hove Singularities: Observation of Electrically Tunable van Hove Singularities in Twisted Bilayer Graphene from NanoARPES (Adv. Mater. 31/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article number 2001656, Jyoti Katoch, S&#248;ran Ulstrup, and co&#8208;workers apply nanoscale angle&#8208;resolved photoemission (nanoARPES) to measure the superlattice van Hove singularity formed by the Dirac cones of twisted bilayer graphene. The photoemission experiment is performed on a device architecture that permits electrostatic tuning of the doping level, revealing the doping dependence of the singularity over a wide energy range.

      <title>Graphene Quantum Dots: Controllable Singlet&#8211;Triplet Energy Splitting of Graphene Quantum Dots through Oxidation: From Phosphorescence to TADF (Adv. Mater. 31/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article number 2000936, Seunghyup Yoo, Seokwoo Jeon, and co&#8208;workers introduce a novel concept for tuning singlet&#8211;triplet energy splitting of graphene quantum dots (GQDs) by oxidation control, which induces a dramatic afterglow transition from phosphorescence to thermally activated delayed fluorescence. Matrix&#8208;assisted stabilization of triplet excited states provides ultralong lifetimes to such afterglow emissions at room&#8208;temperature, which enables multilevel information security.

      <dc:description>
Thermomechanical patterning of 2D materials into micro/nanostructures with a resolution down to 20 nm is reported by J&#252;rgen Brugger and co&#8208;workers in article number 2001232. A heated scanning nanotip performs the patterning by a combination of heat and local pressure, thereby cleaving chemical bonds of the 2D materials, in concert with the rapid sublimation of the polymer layer underneath.

      <dc:description>
Current understanding of brain development, derived from suboptimal in vitro and animal models, is rudimentary. In article number 2002183, Francis G. Szele, Hagan Bayley, and co&#8208;workers introduce a means to print human neural cells in a soft, biocompatible extracellular matrix. The approach provides precise, customizable construction of natural and unnatural patterns of cells, and yields important insights into the development of the human cerebral cortex.

      <title>Chiral Microstructures: Chiral Assemblies of Laser&#8208;Printed Micropillars Directed by Asymmetrical Capillary Force (Adv. Mater. 31/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
Rationally designed artificial chiral architectures have found broad applications in various fields. In article number 2002356, Yanlei Hu, Dong Wu, and co&#8208;workers describe how highly ordered chiral microstructures can be spontaneously assembled by the meniscus&#8208;directed capillary force arising in an evaporating liquid. The chirality is facilitated by rationally breaking the intrinsic symmetry through cooperative control of the geometry and spatial topology of the pillar unit cells.

Tuning the surface strain of inorganic nanozymes can enhance catalytic reactivity to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS). In article number 2001566, Kyungpyo Park, Taeghwan Hyeon, and co&#8208;workers present epitaxially strained CeO2/Mn3O4 nanocrystals as a highly catalytic antioxidant that can protect tissue&#8208;resident stem cells from ionizing&#8208;radiation&#8208;induced ROS damage.

      <dc:description>
Wood is a prototypical biological material, which adapts to mechanical requirements by the structural organization of cellulose fibrils. The cellulose fiber orientation determines the response of wood to environmental changes as an active material, thereby processing information and converting energy. Some examples for the harvesting of wood activity as well as bioinspiration are discussed.








Abstract
Wood is a prototypical biological material, which adapts to mechanical requirements. The microarchitecture of cellulose fibrils determines the mechanical properties of woody materials, as well as their actuation properties, based on absorption and desorption of water. Herein it is argued that cellulose fiber orientation corresponds to an analog code that determines the response of wood to humidity as an active material. Examples for the harvesting of wood activity, as well as bioinspiration, are given.

      <title>Multiple Mechanical Gradients are Responsible for the Strong Adhesion of Spider Attachment Hair</title>
      <dc:description>
Nanostructured adhesive hair on the feet of spiders is responsible for strong adhesion, enabling the animals to walk upside down. Using scanning nanofocus X&#8208;ray scattering under force control, the mechanism of alignment and consequently intimate contact, leading to adhesion of the nanostructures to a surface, is examined. The results show excellent adaptation of the biological structures for their specific function.








Abstract
Wandering spiders climb vertically and walk upside&#8208;down on rough and smooth surfaces using a nanostructured attachment system on their feet. The spiders are assumed to adhere by intermolecular van der Waals forces between the adhesive structures and the substrate. The adhesive elements are arranged highly ordered on the hierarchically structured attachment hair (setae). While walking, it has been suggested that the spiders apply a shear force on their legs to increase friction. However, the detailed mechanical behavior of the hair's structures during attachment and detachment remains unknown. Here, gradients of the mechanical properties of the attachment hair on different length scales that have evolved to support attachment, stabilize adhesion in contact, and withstand high stress at detachment, examined by in situ experiments, are shown. Shearing helps to self&#8208;align the adhesive elements with the substrate. The study is anticipated to contribute to the development of optimized artificial dry adhesives.

      <title>On&#8208;Demand Local Modification of High&#8208;Tc Superconductivity in Few Unit&#8208;Cell Thick Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+&#948;</title>
      <dc:description>
A nondestructive method of patterning high&#8208;temperature superconductivity in few unit&#8208;cell thick Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+&#948; (BSCCO) is developed. Deposition of reactive metals like Cr or Ti on the surface of few unit&#8208;cell thick BSCCO alters the superconductivity in underlying layers by locally depleting oxygen content. Using this technique, superconductivity in BSCCO can be spatially patterned to make superconducting devices like nanowires.








Abstract
High&#8208;temperature superconductors (HTSs) are important for potential applications and for understanding the origin of strong correlations. Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+&#948; (BSCCO), a van der Waals material, offers a platform to probe the physics down to a unit&#8208;cell. Guiding the flow of electrons by patterning 2DEGS and oxide heterostructures has brought new functionality and access to new science. Similarly, modifying superconductivity in HTS locally, on a small length scale, is of immense interest for superconducting electronics. A route to modify superconductivity locally by depositing metal on the surface is reported here by transport studies on few unit&#8208;cell thick BSCCO. Deposition of chromium (Cr) on the surface over a selected area of BSCCO results in insulating behavior of the underlying region. Cr locally depletes oxygen in CuO2 planes and disrupts the superconductivity in the layers below. This technique of modifying superconductivity is suitable for making sub&#8208;micrometer superconducting wires and more complex superconducting&#160;devices.

      <title>A Single&#8208;Pixel RGB Device in a Colorful Alphanumeric Electrofluorochromic Display</title>
      <dc:description>
A single&#8208;pixel RGB electrofluorochromic (EFC) device is fabricated based on proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer, with remarkable EFC properties, and a prototype of a colorful pixel&#8208;based alphanumeric display is demonstrated. The success of this new exploration provides the possibility of full&#8208;color emission in EFC devices, and widely broadens the EFC system and its applications.








Abstract
With the rapid development of human society, consumer electronics have brought marvelous changes to human daily life, but they are accompanied by the much higher demand of display quality and visual experience. Therefore, ideal conversion among the three primary colors&#8212;red (R), green (G), and blue (B)&#8212;in a single pixel has been a better way to avoid the insurmountable technical barrier of subpixel technology of modern displays. Electrofluorochromic (EFC) materials capable of a novel luminescent switching, open a powerful way to design optoelectronic devices for displays and information storage etc. Colorful EFC devices, especially emitting the ideal three primary colors without subpixel technology, have been a challenge for years. Herein, a long&#8208;awaited single&#8208;pixel device with RGB color is fabricated successfully based on proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer. The RGB EFC device exhibits outstanding EFC properties, such as low turn&#8208;on voltage (+1.0 and &#8722;1.0 V), large color gamut, and good stability (500 cycles for each color). Prototypes of colorful alphanumeric displays are well demonstrated in a facile way. The success of this new exploration of single&#8208;pixel RGB EFC device not only provides the possibility of full&#8208;color emission in EFC devices, but also will widely broaden the EFC system and their applications.

      <title>Devising Materials Manufacturing Toward Lab&#8208;to&#8208;Fab Translation of Flexible Electronics</title>
      <dc:description>
Flexible electronics have witnessed tremendous progress in academia over the past decade, but their industrial adoption lags behind. To stimulate faster lab&#8208;to&#8208;fab translation, the current status of flexible electronics is reviewed, critical challenges in materials manufacturing during lab&#8208;to&#8208;fab translation are identified, and perspectives on research and development that can expedite the translation process are proposed.








Abstract
Flexible electronics have witnessed exciting progress in academia over the past decade, but most of the research outcomes have yet to be translated into products or gain much market share. For mass production and commercialization, industrial adoption of newly developed functional materials and fabrication techniques is a prerequisite. However, due to the disparate features of academic laboratories and industrial plants, translating materials and manufacturing technologies from labs to fabs is notoriously difficult. Therefore, herein, key challenges in the materials manufacturing of flexible electronics are identified and discussed for its lab&#8208;to&#8208;fab translation, along the four stages in product manufacturing: design, materials supply, processing, and integration. Perspectives on industry&#8208;oriented strategies to overcome some of these obstacles are also proposed. Priorities for action are outlined, including standardization, iteration between basic and applied research, and adoption of smart manufacturing. With concerted efforts from academia and industry, flexible electronics will bring a bigger impact to society as promised.

      <title>Stone&#8211;Wales Defects Cause High Proton Permeability and Isotope Selectivity of Single&#8208;Layer Graphene</title>
      <dc:description>
Topological (vacancy&#8208;free) Stone&#8211;Wales defects significantly lower the penetration barrier for hydrogen through graphene: the proton flow through a seven&#8208;membered ring is a million times higher compared to a ring in the pristine honeycomb lattice, and yields an H&#8208;over&#8208;D selectivity of 7 at ambient condition. These calculated results can explain hydrogen isotope separation on defect&#8208;free graphene.








Abstract
While the isotope&#8208;dependent hydrogen permeability of graphene membranes at ambient condition has been demonstrated, the underlying mechanism has been controversially discussed during the past 5 years. The reported room&#8208;temperature proton&#8208;over&#8208;deuteron (H+&#8208;over&#8208;D+) selectivity is 10, much higher than in any competing method. Yet, it has not been understood how protons can penetrate through graphene membranes&#8212;proposed hypotheses include atomic defects and local hydrogenation. However, neither can explain both the high permeability and high selectivity of the atomically thin membranes. Here, it is confirmed that ideal graphene is quasi&#8208;impermeable to protons, yet the most common defect in sp2 carbons, the topological Stone&#8211;Wales defect, has a calculated penetration barrier below 1 eV and H+&#8208;over&#8208;D+ selectivity of &#8202;7 at room temperature and, thus, explains all experimental results on graphene membranes that are available to date. The competing explanation, local hydrogenation, which also reduces the penetration barrier, but shows significantly lower isotope selectivity, is challenged.

      <title>Rational Design of Functional Peptide&#8208;Gold Hybrid Nanomaterials for Molecular Interactions</title>
      <dc:description>
In this contribution, rational designed functional peptide&#8208;gold hybrid nanomaterials are reviewed for various applications such as biosensing, targeting, imaging, and so forth, due to their specific molecular interactions. With all advantages of peptide&#8208;gold&#8208;based interactive nano&#8208;approaches, they are promising for future applications in the biomedical domain and beyond, especially in field testing.








Abstract
Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have been extensively used for decades in biosensing&#8208;related development due to outstanding optical properties. Peptides, as newly realized functional biomolecules, are promising candidates of replacing antibodies, receptors, and substrates for specific molecular interactions. Both peptides and AuNPs are robust and easily synthesized at relatively low cost. Hence, peptide&#8208;AuNP&#8208;based bio&#8208;nano&#8208;technological approaches have drawn increasing interest, especially in the field of molecular targeting, cell imaging, drug delivery, and therapy. Many excellent works in these areas have been reported: demonstrating novel ideas, exploring new targets, and facilitating advanced diagnostic and therapeutic technologies. Importantly, some of them also have been employed to address real practical problems, especially in remote and less privileged areas. This contribution focuses on the application of peptide&#8211;gold hybrid nanomaterials for various molecular interactions, especially in biosensing/diagnostics and cell targeting/imaging, as well as for the development of highly active antimicrobial/antifouling coating strategies. Rationally designed peptide&#8211;gold nanomaterials with functional properties are discussed along with future challenges and opportunities.

      <title>Effect of Adventitious Carbon on Pit Formation of Monolayer MoS2</title>
      <dc:description>
In situ environmental transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements show that pit formation by thermal oxidation is preferentially initiated at the interface between adventitious carbon (C) nanoparticles and monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), rather than only sulfur vacancies. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the C/MoS2 interface favors the sequential adsorption of oxygen atoms with facile kinetics.








Abstract
Forming pits on molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) monolayers is desirable for (opto)electrical, catalytic, and biological applications. Thermal oxidation is a potentially scalable method to generate pits on monolayer MoS2, and pits are assumed to preferentially form around undercoordinated sites, such as sulfur vacancies. However, studies on thermal oxidation of MoS2 monolayers have not considered the effect of adventitious carbon (C) that is ubiquitous and interacts with oxygen at elevated temperatures. Herein, the effect of adventitious C on the pit formation on MoS2 monolayers during thermal oxidation is studied. The in situ environmental transmission electron microscopy measurements herein show that pit formation is preferentially initiated at the interface between adventitious C nanoparticles and MoS2, rather than only sulfur vacancies. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the C/MoS2 interface favors the sequential adsorption of oxygen atoms with facile kinetics. These results illustrate the important role of adventitious C on pit formation on monolayer MoS2.

      <title>Magnetic Skyrmions in a Hall Balance with Interfacial Canted Magnetizations</title>
      <dc:description>
N&#233;el&#8208;type skyrmions at zero field and room temperature are experimentally observed using Lorentz&#8208;TEM in a Hall balance with core structure of [Co/Pt]n/NiO/[Co/Pt]n. Interfacial canted magnetizations across NiO spacer give rise to the nucleation of high&#8208;density skyrmions under pulsed current, which shows a strong dependence on interlayer exchange coupling. The Physical mechanism of the skyrmions in synthetic antiferromagnets is presented.








Abstract
Magnetic skyrmions are attracting interest as efficient information&#8208;storage devices with low energy consumption, and have been experimentally and theoretically investigated in multilayers including ferromagnets, ferrimagnets, and antiferromagnets. The 3D spin texture of skyrmions demonstrated in ferromagnetic multilayers provides a powerful pathway for understanding the stabilization of ferromagnetic skyrmions. However, the manipulation mechanism of skyrmions in antiferromagnets is still lacking. A Hall balance with a ferromagnet/insulating spacer/ferromagnet structure is considered to be a promising candidate to study skyrmions in synthetic antiferromagnets. Here, high&#8208;density N&#233;el&#8208;type skyrmions are experimentally observed at zero field and room temperature by Lorentz transmission electron microscopy in a Hall balance (core structure [Co/Pt]n/NiO/[Co/Pt]n) with interfacial canted magnetizations because of interlayer ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic coupling between top and bottom [Co/Pt]n multilayers, where the Co layers in [Co/Pt]n are always ferromagnetically coupled. Micromagnetic simulations show that the generation and density of skyrmions are strongly dependent on interlayer exchange coupling (IEC) and easy&#8208;axis orientation. Direct experimental evidence of skyrmions in synthetic antiferromagnets is provided, suggesting that the proposed approach offers a promising alternative mechanism for room&#8208;temperature spintronics.

      <title>Calendering&#8208;Compatible Macroporous Architecture for Silicon&#8211;Graphite Composite toward High&#8208;Energy Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
There is a gap between lithium&#8208;ion batteries in academia and industry, which is the lack of consideration of industrial requirements in terms of electrode conditions, such as calendering. In this work, a calendering&#8208;compatible macroporous design is presented. This unique design enables both high electrode density without any collapse of pores and an excellent energy density with good cycle life under practical conditions.








Abstract
Porous strategies based on nanoengineering successfully mitigate several problems related to volume expansion of alloying anodes. However, practical application of porous alloying anodes is challenging because of limitations such as calendering incompatibility, low mass loading, and excessive usage of nonactive materials, all of which cause a lower volumetric energy density in comparison with conventional graphite anodes. In particular, during calendering, porous structures in alloying&#8208;based composites easily collapse under high pressure, attenuating the porous characteristics. Herein, this work proposes a calendering&#8208;compatible macroporous architecture for a Si&#8211;graphite anode to maximize the volumetric energy density. The anode is composed of an elastic outermost carbon covering, a nonfilling porous structure, and a graphite core. Owing to the lubricative properties of the elastic carbon covering, the macroporous structure coated by the brittle Si nanolayer can withstand high pressure and maintain its porous architecture during electrode calendering. Scalable methods using mechanical agitation and chemical vapor deposition are adopted. The as&#8208;prepared composite exhibits excellent electrochemical stability of &gt;3.6 mAh cm&#8722;2, with mitigated electrode expansion. Furthermore, full&#8208;cell evaluation shows that the composite achieves higher energy density (932 Wh L&#8722;1) and higher specific energy (333 Wh kg&#8722;1) with stable cycling than has been reported in previous studies.

Abstract
The ability to switch magnetic elements by spin&#8208;orbit&#8208;induced torques has recently attracted much attention for a path toward high&#8208;performance, nonvolatile memories with low power consumption. Realizing efficient spin&#8208;orbit&#8208;based switching requires the harnessing of both new materials and novel physics to obtain high charge&#8208;to&#8208;spin conversion efficiencies, thus making the choice of spin source crucial. Here, the observation of spin&#8208;orbit torque switching in bilayers consisting of a semimetallic film of 1T&#8242;&#8208;MoTe2 adjacent to permalloy is reported. Deterministic switching is achieved without external magnetic fields at room temperature, and the switching occurs with currents one order of magnitude smaller than those typical in devices using the best&#8208;performing heavy metals. The thickness&#8208;dependence can be understood if the interfacial spin&#8208;orbit contribution is considered in addition to the bulk spin Hall effect. Further threefold reduction in the switching current is demonstrated with resort to dumbbell&#8208;shaped magnetic elements. These findings foretell exciting prospects of using MoTe2 for low&#8208;power semimetal&#8208;material&#8208;based spin devices.

      <title>Autonomous Surface Reconciliation of a Liquid&#8208;Metal Conductor Micropatterned on a Deformable Hydrogel</title>
      <dc:description>
Micropatternable, super&#8208;stretchable, self&#8208;healable, and water&#8208;swellable liquid&#8208;metal electrodes are developed with a low resistance of &#8776;2 and &#8776;4.6 &#937; at strains of 0% and 1500%, respectively, with low variation in conductance (a variation factor of &#8776;2.3) by utilizing autonomous surface reconciliation of EGaIn on chemically modified hydrogels. These electrodes are suitable for a variety of deformable microelectronic applications.








Abstract
Spreading liquid droplets on solid surfaces is a core topic in physical chemistry with significant technological implications. Liquid metals, which are eutectic alloys of constituent metal atoms with low melting temperatures, are practically useful, but difficult to spread on solid surfaces because of their high surface tension. This makes it difficult to use liquid metals as deformable on&#8208;board microcircuitry electrodes, despite their intrinsic deformability. In this study, it is discovered that eutectic gallium&#8211;indium (EGaIn) can be spread onto the surface of chemically cross&#8208;linked hydrogels consisting of aliphatic alkyl chains with numerous hydroxyl groups (&#63743;OH), thus facilitating the development of directly micropatterned EGaIn electrodes. More importantly, EGaIn patterned on a hydrogel autonomously reconciliates its surface to form a firm hydrogel interface upon mechanical deformation of the hydrogel. This autonomous surface reconciliation of EGaIn on hydrogels allows researchers to reap the benefits of chemically modified hydrogels, such as reversible stretching, self&#8208;healing, and water&#8208;swelling capability, thereby facilitating the fabrication of superstretchable, self&#8208;healable, and water&#8208;swellable liquid&#8208;metal electrodes with very high conductance tolerance upon deformation. Such electrodes are suitable for a variety of deformable microelectronic applications.

      <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Colossal Magnetoresistance in Terraced Single&#8208;Layer Graphene</title>
      <dc:description>
Terraced graphene, formed by laminating single&#8208;layer graphene on a terraced substrate, shows a colossal magnetoresistance of up to 5000% at 9 T and 300&#160;K. The magnetoresistance enhancement is attributed to the topographic corrugations and inhomogeneous charge puddles induced by the terraced structure. The concept of inducing colossal magnetoresistance by stepped surfaces is certainly boosting room&#8208;temperature graphene magnetic sensors.








Abstract
Disorder&#8208;induced magnetoresistance (MR) effect is quadratic at low perpendicular magnetic fields and linear at high fields. This effect is technologically appealing, especially in 2D materials such as graphene, since it offers potential applications in magnetic sensors with nanoscale spatial resolution. However, it is a great challenge to realize a graphene magnetic sensor based on this effect because of the difficulty in controlling the spatial distribution of disorder and enhancing the MR sensitivity in the single&#8208;layer regime. Here, a room&#8208;temperature colossal MR of up to 5000% at 9 T is reported in terraced single&#8208;layer graphene. By laminating single&#8208;layer graphene on a terraced substrate, such as TiO2&#8208;terminated SrTiO3, a universal one order of magnitude enhancement in the MR compared to conventional single&#8208;layer graphene devices is demonstrated. Strikingly, a colossal MR of &gt;1000% is also achieved in the terraced graphene even at a high carrier density of &#8776;1012 cm&#8722;2. Systematic studies of the MR of single&#8208;layer graphene on various oxide&#8208; and non&#8208;oxide&#8208;based terraced surfaces demonstrate that the terraced structure is the dominant factor driving the MR enhancement. The results open a new route for tailoring the physical property of 2D materials by engineering the strain through a terraced substrate.

      <title>Tocilizumab&#8208;Conjugated Polymer Nanoparticles for NIR&#8208;II Photoacoustic&#8208;Imaging&#8208;Guided Therapy of Rheumatoid Arthritis</title>
      <dc:description>
The US Food and Drug Administration approved antirheumatic targeted drug tocilizumab (TCZ) is conjugated to polymer nanoparticles (PNPs) to develop TCZ&#8208;PNPs for near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;II photoacoustic (PA) imaging&#8208;guided therapy of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). TCZ&#8208;PNPs&#8208;assisted NIR&#8208;II PA molecular imaging shows that TCZ&#8208;PNPs have excellent RA specificity and significant suppression effect, which provides a new strategy for RA theranostics and therapeutic monitoring.








Abstract
The progressive debilitating nature of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) combined with its unknown etiology and initial similarity to other inflammatory diseases makes early diagnosis a significant challenge. Early recognition and treatment of RA is essential for achieving effective therapeutic outcome. NIR&#8208;II photoacoustic (PA) molecular imaging (PMI) is emerging as a promising new strategy for effective diagnosis and treatment guidance of RA, owing to its high sensitivity and specificity at large penetration depth. Herein, an antirheumatic targeted drug tocilizumab (TCZ) is conjugated to polymer nanoparticles (PNPs) to develop the first NIR&#8208;II theranostic nanoplatform, named TCZ&#8208;PNPs, for PA&#8208;imaging&#8208;guided therapy of RA. The TCZ&#8208;PNPs are demonstrated to have strong NIR&#8208;II extinction coefficient, high photostability and excellent biocompatibility. NIR&#8208;II PMI results reveal the excellent targeting abilities of TCZ&#8208;PNPs for the effective noninvasive diagnosis of RA joint tissue with a high signal&#8208;to noise ratio (SNR) of 35.8 dB in 3D PA tomography images. Remarkably, one&#8208;month treatment and PA monitoring using TCZ&#8208;PNPs shows RA is significantly suppressed. In addition, the therapeutic evaluation of RA mice by NIR&#8208;II PMI is shown to be consistent with clinical micro&#8208;CT and histological analysis. The TCZ&#8208;PNPs&#8208;assisted NIR&#8208;II PMI provides a new strategy for RA theranostics, therapeutic monitoring and the beyond.

      <title>A Moisture&#8208;Hungry Copper Complex Harvesting Air Moisture for Potable Water and Autonomous Urban Agriculture</title>
      <dc:description>
A moisture&#8208;hungry Cu&#8208;complex is synthesized and used for fabricating a SmartFarm device that can harvest atmospheric water during the nighttime and release water during the daytime under natural sunlight. The device enables self&#8208;sustainable and autonomous irrigation to alleviate both water and food scarcity.








Abstract
The earth's atmosphere houses an enormous amount of water, which could be effectively exploited for a plethora of applications. While the development of materials for harnessing this abundant resource has gained impetus in recent years, limited efforts have been devoted to in&#8208;depth research on their agricultural applications. Herein, a novel copper(II)&#8211;ethanolamine complex (Cu&#8208;complex), which has a maximum water uptake of up to 300% and a water production rate of 2.24 g g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 under natural sunlight, is reported. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application, using this material, a fully automated and self&#8208;sustainable solar&#8208;powered SmartFarm device is developed. The Cu&#8208;complex harvests atmospheric water during the night, stores the adsorbed water within, and efficiently releases the adsorbed water during the day when the device is exposed to sunlight. The water harvesting and irrigation process can be fine&#8208;tuned to suit different types of plants and local climates for an optimal cultivation. With the SmartFarm in operation, the demand for freshwater for irrigation could be greatly reduced and urban farming techniques such as large&#8208;scale rooftop farming could be promoted with a view of alleviating both water and food scarcity in the near future.

      <title>Chiral Transition Metal Oxides: Synthesis, Chiral Origins, and Perspectives</title>
      <dc:description>
Transition metal oxides with induced chirality have revolutionized the area of chiroptics and motifs of fundamental research on chiral origin of inorganic nanomaterials with chiral morphologies or chiral interactions with the environment, demonstrating capacities of such unique classes of nano&#8208; to microscale materials for the applications in environmental remediation, stereoselective synthesis, and biological science.








Abstract
Transition metal oxides (TMOs) consist of a series of solid materials, exhibiting a wide variety of structures with tunability and versatile physicochemical properties. Such a statement is undeniably true for chiral TMOs since the introduction of chirality brings in not only active optical activities but also geometrical anisotropy due to the symmetry&#8208;breaking effect. Although progressive investigations have been made for accurately controlled synthesis and relevant explanations on the chirality origin of such materials, the overall field of chiral TMOs is still in its infancy with adequate space for interdisciplinary communications and development. Herein, therefore, recent advances in both experimental phenomena and theoretical calculations in this area are reviewed, to elucidate the underlying chiral origin with respect to their fabrications process, triggering new insights for further evolution of this field.

      <title>Aggregate Science: From Structures to Properties</title>
      <dc:description>
The study of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) creates many aggregate&#8208;related research branches in which the structures and properties are quite different from those of their molecular components. By virtue of the emerging AIE research, the concept of &#8220;aggregate science&#8221; is proposed to fill the gap between molecules and aggregates, meanwhile providing a general platform for academic research at the mesoscale.








Abstract
Molecular science entails the study of structures and properties of materials at the level of single molecules or small interacting complexes of molecules. Moving beyond single molecules and well&#8208;defined complexes, aggregates (i.e., irregular clusters of many molecules) serve as a particularly useful form of materials that often display modified or wholly new properties compared to their molecular components. Some unique structures and phenomena such as polymorphic aggregates, aggregation&#8208;induced symmetry breaking, and cluster excitons are only identified in aggregates, as a few examples of their exotic features. Here, by virtue of the flourishing research on aggregation&#8208;induced emission, the concept of &#8220;aggregate science&#8221; is put forward to fill the gaps between molecules and aggregates. Structures and properties on the aggregate scale are also systematically summarized. The structure&#8211;property relationships established for aggregates are expected to contribute to new materials and technological development. Ultimately, aggregate science may become an interdisciplinary research field and serves as a general platform for academic research.

      <title>Thiol&#8208;Branched Solid Polymer Electrolyte Featuring High Strength, Toughness, and Lithium Ionic Conductivity for Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
A thiol&#8208;branched SPE is synthesized to decouple ionic conductivity and mechanic strength and it features high mechanical strength, toughness, and ionic conductivity. Meanwhile, the SPE is also endowed with the functions of both enabling fast Li+ transport and blocking Li dendrite growth, thereby guaranteeing a high stability in battery cycling.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) with high energy densities are highly desirable for energy storage, but generally suffer from dendrite growth and side reactions in liquid electrolytes; thus the need for solid electrolytes with high mechanical strength, ionic conductivity, and compatible interface arises. Herein, a thiol&#8208;branched solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) is introduced featuring high Li+ conductivity (2.26 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 at room temperature) and good mechanical strength (9.4 MPa)/toughness (&#8776;500%), thus unblocking the tradeoff between ionic conductivity and mechanical robustness in polymer electrolytes. The SPE (denoted as M&#8208;S&#8208;PEGDA) is fabricated by covalently cross&#8208;linking metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), tetrakis (3&#8208;mercaptopropionic acid) pentaerythritol (PETMP), and poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) via multiple C&#63743;S&#63743;C bonds. The SPE also exhibits a high electrochemical window (&gt;5.4 V), low interfacial impedance (&lt;550 &#937;), and impressive Li+ transference number (tLi+ = 0.44). As a result, Li||Li symmetrical cells with the thiol&#8208;branched SPE displayed a high stability in a &gt;1300 h cycling test. Moreover, a Li|M&#8208;S&#8208;PEGDA|LiFePO4 full cell demonstrates discharge capacity of 143.7 mAh g&#8722;1 and maintains 85.6% after 500 cycles at 0.5 C, displaying one of the most outstanding performances for SPEs to date.

      <title>Emergent Nonreciprocal Circularly Polarized Emission from an Organic Thin Film</title>
      <dc:description>
The thin film of a chiral &#960;&#8208;conjugated phenylene derivative emits circularly polarized (CP) light with a high degree of dissymmetry and opposite handedness from the two opposite faces of the film. Nonreciprocal CP emission is unreported so far, and it offers new opportunities in the design of CP emitting materials.








Abstract
Controlling circularly polarized (CP) emission is key for both fundamental understanding and applications in the field of chiral photonics and electronics. Here, a completely new way to achieve this goal is presented. A luminescent thin film, made from a chiral conjugated phenylene bis&#8208;thiophenylpropynone able to self&#8208;assemble into ordered structures, emits highly circularly polarized light with opposite handedness from its two opposite faces. Such emergent nonreciprocal behavior in CP emission, so far unprecedented, represents a fundamental advance, opening new opportunities in design, preparation, and applications of CP emitting materials.

      <title>Large Switchable Photoconduction within 2D Potential Well of a Layered Ferroelectric Heterostructure</title>
      <dc:description>
Coexistence of a 2D potential well and robust ferroelectric polarization is achieved in layered&#8208;perovskite Bi2WO6, leading to a large and stable photocurrent density in an artificially designed photosensitive Bi2WO6/SrTiO3 heterostructure. Such a prototype device shows a great potential for applications in high&#8208;efficiency photovoltaic cells and nonvolatile information processing with low power consumption.








Abstract
The coexistence of large conductivity and robust ferroelectricity is promising for high&#8208;performance ferroelectric devices based on polarization&#8208;controllable highly efficient carrier transport. Distinct from traditional perovskite ferroelectrics, Bi2WO6 with a layered structure shows a great potential to preserve its ferroelectricity under substantial electron doping. Herein, by artificial design of photosensitive heterostructures with desired band alignment, three orders of magnitude enhancement of the short&#8208;circuit photocurrent is achieved in Bi2WO6/SrTiO3 at room temperature. The microscopic mechanism of this large photocurrent originates from separated transport of electrons and holes in [WO4]&#8722;2 and [Bi2O2]+2 layers respectively with a large in&#8208;plane conductivity, which is understood by a combination of ab initio calculations and spectroscopic measurements. The layered electronic structure and appropriately designed band alignment in this layered ferroelectric heterostructure provide an opportunity to achieve high&#8208;performance and nonvolatile switchable electronic devices.

DNA micro&#8208;disks, QR&#8208;coded micro&#8208;sized disks that harbor data&#8208;encoded DNA molecules for the efficient management of DNA&#8208;based data storage are proposed. Using these DNA micro&#8208;disks, data items can be efficiently accessed by indexing the data&#8208;encoded DNA library and write&#8208;once&#8211;read&#8208;many (WORM) memory can be demonstrated through in situ DNA production on the DNA micro&#8208;disks.








Abstract
DNA&#8208;based data storage has attracted attention because of its higher physical density of the data and longer retention time than those of conventional digital data storage. However, previous DNA&#8208;based data storage lacked index features and the data quality of storage after a single access was not preserved, obstructing its industrial use. Here, DNA micro&#8208;disks, QR&#8208;coded micro&#8208;sized disks that harbor data&#8208;encoded DNA molecules for the efficient management of DNA&#8208;based data storage, are proposed. The two major features that previous DNA&#8208;based data&#8208;storage studies could not achieve are demonstrated. One feature is accessing data items efficiently by indexing the data&#8208;encoded DNA library. Another is achieving write&#8208;once&#8211;read&#8208;many (WORM) memory through the immobilization of DNA molecules on the disk and their enrichment through in situ DNA production. Through these features, the reliability of DNA&#8208;based data storage is increased by allowing selective and multiple accession of data&#8208;encoded DNA with lower data loss than previous DNA&#8208;based data storage methods.

Abstract
Wood materials are being reinvented to carry superior properties for a variety of new applications. Cutting&#8208;edge nanomanufacturing transforms traditional bulky and low&#8208;value woods into advanced materials that have desired structures, durability, and functions to replace nonrenewable plastics, polymers, and metals. Here, a first prospect report on how novel nanowood materials have been developed and applied in water and associated industries is provided, wherein their unique features and promises are discussed. First, the unique hierarchical structure and associated properties of the material are introduced, and then how such features can be harnessed and modified by either bottom&#8208;up or top&#8208;down manufacturing to enable different functions for water filtration, chemical adsorption and catalysis, energy and resource recovery, as well as energy&#8208;efficient desalination and environmental cleanup are discussed. The study recognizes that this is a nascent but very promising field; therefore, insights are offered to encourage more research and development. Trees harness solar energy and CO2 and provide abundant carbon&#8208;negative materials. Once harvested and utilized, it is believed that advanced wood materials will play a vital role in enabling a circular water economy.

      <title>Structure&#8211;Transport Correlation Reveals Anisotropic Charge Transport in Coupled PbS Nanocrystal Superlattices</title>
      <dc:description>
Nanocrystal superlattices exhibit favored directions for charge transport. Electronic and structural properties of microdomains of coupled PbS nanocrystal superlattices are correlatively investigated by conductivity and X&#8208;ray nanodiffraction measurements. Highly ordered superlattices of iso&#8208;oriented nanocrystals show electrical transport anisotropy, a feature attractive for electronic applications, which has never been experimentally demonstrated for nanocrystal superlattices before.








Abstract
The assembly of colloidal semiconductive nanocrystals into highly ordered superlattices predicts novel structure&#8208;related properties by design. However, those structure&#8211;property relationships, such as charge transport depending on the structure or even directions of the superlattice, have remained unrevealed so far. Here, electric transport measurements and X&#8208;ray nanodiffraction are performed on self&#8208;assembled lead sulfide nanocrystal superlattices to investigate direction&#8208;dependent charge carrier transport in microscopic domains of these materials. By angular X&#8208;ray cross&#8208;correlation analysis, the structure and orientation of individual superlattices is determined, which are directly correlated with the electronic properties of the same microdomains. By that, strong evidence for the effect of superlattice crystallinity on the electric conductivity is found. Further, anisotropic charge transport in highly ordered monocrystalline domains is revealed, which is attributed to the dominant effect of shortest interparticle distance. This implies that transport anisotropy should be a general feature of weakly coupled nanocrystal superlattices.

      <title>Electrochemical Intercalation in Atomically Thin van der Waals Materials for Structural Phase Transition and Device Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
Recent progress on the electrochemical intercalation of foreign species into atomically thin 2D materials and van der Waals heterostructures via versatile electrochemical platforms and their influence on the structural phase transition of materials and novel device applications is reviewed, and the future opportunities especially on the intercalation via solid ion conductor field effect transistors are discussed.








Abstract
In van der Waals (vdWs) materials and heterostructures, the interlayers are bonded by weak vdWs interactions due to the lack of dangling bonds. The vdWs gap at the homo&#8208; or heterointerface provides great freedom to enrich the tunability of electronic structures by external intercalation of foreign ions or atoms at the interface, leading to the discovery of new physics and functionalities. Herein, the recent progress on electrochemical intercalation of foreign species into atomically thin vdWs materials for structural phase transition and device applications is reviewed and future opportunities are discussed. First, several kinds of electrochemical intercalation platforms to achieve the intercalation in vdWs materials and heterostructures are introduced. Next, the in situ characterization of electrochemical intercalation dynamics by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art techniques is summarized, including optical techniques, scanning probe techniques, and electrical transport. Moreover, particular attention is paid on the experimentally reported phase transition and multifunctional applications of intercalated devices. Finally, future applications and challenges of intercalation in vdWs materials and heterostructures are proposed, including the intrinsic intercalation mechanism of solid ion conductors, exact identification of intercalated foreign species by near&#8208;field optical techniques, and the tunability of intercalation kinetics for ultrafast switching.

      <title>Diode&#8208;Like Selective Enhancement of Carrier Transport through Metal&#8211;Semiconductor Interface Decorated by Monolayer Boron Nitride</title>
      <dc:description>
For the first time, a novel diode&#8208;like selective enhancement of the carrier transport through a metal&#8211;insulator&#8211;semiconductor (MIS) contact is revealed through a comparison with conventional metal&#8211;semiconductor contact on a single monolayer MoS2 triangular domain. The MIS contact exploits monolayer hexagonal boron nitride as an ultrathin decorating layer added between MoS2 and metal contact.








Abstract
2D semiconductors such as monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) are promising material candidates for next&#8208;generation nanoelectronics. However, there are fundamental challenges related to their metal&#8211;semiconductor (MS) contacts, which limit the performance potential for practical device applications. In this work, 2D monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) is exploited as an ultrathin decorating layer to form a metal&#8211;insulator&#8211;semiconductor (MIS) contact, and an innovative device architecture is designed as a platform to reveal a novel diode&#8208;like selective enhancement of the carrier transport through the MIS contact. The contact resistance is significantly reduced when the electrons are transported from the semiconductor to the metal, but is barely affected when the electrons are transported oppositely. A concept of carrier collection barrier is proposed to interpret this intriguing phenomenon as well as a negative Schottky barrier height obtained from temperature&#8208;dependent measurements, and the critical role of the collection barrier at the drain end is shown for the overall transistor performance.

      <title>Water Passivation of Perovskite Nanocrystals Enables Air&#8208;Stable Intrinsically Stretchable Color&#8208;Conversion Layers for Stretchable Displays</title>
      <dc:description>
Here, an air&#8208;stable stretchable display consisting of an intrinsically stretchable electroluminescent device and perovskite nanocrystal (PeNCs) stretchable color conversion layer is proposed. Surprisingly, the increase in photoluminescence intensity of PeNCs in the water is proved to be caused by the surface passivation of moisture, which overcomes the water instability of perovskite materials.








Abstract
Conventional organic light&#8208;emitting devices without an encapsulation layer are susceptible to degradation when exposed to air, so realization of air&#8208;stable intrinsically&#8208;stretchable display is a great challenge because the protection of the devices against penetration of moisture and oxygen is even more difficult under stretching. An air&#8208;stable intrinsically&#8208;stretchable display that is composed of an intrinsically&#8208;stretchable electroluminescent device (SELD) integrated with a stretchable color&#8208;conversion layer (SCCL) that contains perovskite nanocrystals (PeNCs) is proposed. PeNCs normally decay when exposed to air, but they become resistant to this decay when dispersed in a stretchable elastomer matrix; this change is a result of a compatibility between capping ligands and the elastomer matrix. Counterintuitively, the moisture can efficiently passivate surface defects of PeNCs, to yield significant increases in both photoluminescence intensity and lifetime. A display that can be stretched up to 180% is demonstrated; it is composed of an air&#8208;stable SCCL that down&#8208;converts the SELD&#8217;s blue emission and reemits it as green. The work elucidates the basis of moisture&#8208;assisted surface passivation of PeNCs and provides a promising strategy to improve the quantum efficiency of PeNCs with the aid of moisture, which allows PeNCs to be applied for air&#8208;stable stretchable displays.

      <title>Porous Materials Applied in Nonaqueous Li&#8211;O2 Batteries: Status and Perspectives</title>
      <dc:description>
The application of nonaqueous Li&#8211;O2 batteries is limited by challenges from the cathode, anode, separator, and electrolyte. The perspectives of porous materials for Li&#8211;O2 batteries are outlined, the advances of porous materials for targeting critical battery challenges are highlighted, rational design and future directions of porous&#8208;materials&#8208;based Li&#8211;O2 battery systems are suggested.








Abstract
Porous materials possessing high surface area, large pore volume, tunable pore structure, superior tailorability, and dimensional effect have been widely applied as components of lithium&#8211;oxygen (Li&#8211;O2) batteries. Herein, the theoretical foundation of the porous materials applied in Li&#8211;O2 batteries is provided, based on the present understanding of the battery mechanism and the challenges and advantageous qualities of porous materials. Furthermore, recent progress in porous materials applied as the cathode, anode, separator, and electrolyte in Li&#8211;O2 batteries is summarized, together with corresponding approaches to address the critical issues that remain at present. Particular emphasis is placed on the importance of the correlation between the function&#8208;orientated design of porous materials and key challenges of Li&#8211;O2 batteries in accelerating oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)/oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics, improving the electrode stability, controlling lithium deposition, suppressing the shuttle effect of the dissolved redox mediators, and alleviating electrolyte decomposition. Finally, the rational design and innovative directions of porous materials are provided for their development and application in Li&#8211;O2 battery systems.

     alt="Porous Materials Applied in Nonaqueous Li&#8211;O2 Batteries: Status and Perspectives"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application of nonaqueous Li&#8211;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries is limited by challenges from the cathode, anode, separator, and electrolyte. The perspectives of porous materials for Li&#8211;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries are outlined, the advances of porous materials for targeting critical battery challenges are highlighted, rational design and future directions of porous&#8208;materials&#8208;based Li&#8211;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; battery systems are suggested.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Porous materials possessing high surface area, large pore volume, tunable pore structure, superior tailorability, and dimensional effect have been widely applied as components of lithium&#8211;oxygen (Li&#8211;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) batteries. Herein, the theoretical foundation of the porous materials applied in Li&#8211;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries is provided, based on the present understanding of the battery mechanism and the challenges and advantageous qualities of porous materials. Furthermore, recent progress in porous materials applied as the cathode, anode, separator, and electrolyte in Li&#8211;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries is summarized, together with corresponding approaches to address the critical issues that remain at present. Particular emphasis is placed on the importance of the correlation between the function&#8208;orientated design of porous materials and key challenges of Li&#8211;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries in accelerating oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)/oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics, improving the electrode stability, controlling lithium deposition, suppressing the shuttle effect of the dissolved redox mediators, and alleviating electrolyte decomposition. Finally, the rational design and innovative directions of porous materials are provided for their development and application in Li&#8211;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; battery systems.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Optical Forces: From Fundamental to Biological Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
Optical forces form the basis for optical trapping and manipulation and are of critical importance in various disciplines from fundamental research to practical applications. Advances in optical forces have made significant impacts for biological exploration both in vitro and in vivo, with applications from individual manipulation and analysis to multiple assembly and detection.








Abstract
Optical forces, generally arising from changes of field gradients or linear momentum carried by photons, form the basis for optical trapping and manipulation. Advances in optical forces help to reveal the nature of light&#8211;matter interactions, giving answers to a wide range of questions and solving problems across various disciplines, and are still yielding new insights in many exciting sciences, particularly in the fields of biological technology, material applications, and quantum sciences. This review focuses on recent advances in optical forces, ranging from fundamentals to applications for biological exploration. First, the basics of different types of optical forces with new light&#8211;matter interaction mechanisms and near&#8208;field techniques for optical force generation beyond the diffraction limit with nanometer accuracy are described. Optical forces for biological applications from in vitro to in vivo are then reviewed. Applications from individual manipulation to multiple assembly into functional biophotonic probes and soft&#8208;matter superstructures are discussed. At the end future directions for application of optical forces for biological exploration are provided.

Abstract
The relationship between chirality and superconductivity is an intriguing question. The two enantiomeric crystalline radical cation salts &#954;&#8208;[(S,S)&#8208;DM&#8208;BEDT&#8208;TTF]2ClO4 and &#954;&#8208;[(R,R)&#8208;DM&#8208;BEDT&#8208;TTF]2ClO4, showing &#954;&#8208;type arrangement of the organic layers, are investigated in search for superconducting chiral molecular materials following a 1992 report indicating the occurrence of a superconducting transition in the former compound. While the initial interpretation is presently challenged through in&#8208;depth temperature and pressure dependent single crystal resistivity measurements combined with band structure calculations, the two chiral conductors show metal like behavior with room temperature conductivities of 10&#8211;30 S cm&#8722;1 at ambient pressure and stabilization of the metallic state down to the lowest temperatures under moderate pressures. Moreover, their structural and theoretical investigations reveal an original feature, namely the existence of two different &#954; layers with 1D and 2D electronic dimensionality, respectively, as a consequence of an interlayer charge transfer. The resistivity drop observed for one sample below 1 K and insensitive to magnetic field, possibly results from mixing in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane contributions to the measured resistance and suggests current induced charge order melting. This feature contradicts the occurrence of superconductivity in these chiral molecular conductors and leaves open the discovery of the first chiral molecular superconductors.

      <title>De Novo Design of Covalent Organic Framework Membranes toward Ultrafast Anion Transport</title>
      <dc:description>
The de novo design of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) afforded dense and ordered alignment of quaternary ammonium&#8208;functionalized side chains along the intrinsic channels within the frameworks, rendering one of the highest hydroxide conductivities among the ever&#8208;reported anion exchange membranes (AEMs), and demonstrating the feasibility of COFs as the building blocks for high&#8208;performance AEMs.








Abstract
The emergence of all&#8208;organic frameworks is of fundamental significance, and designing such structures for anion conduction holds great promise in energy conversion and storage applications. Herein, inspired by the efficient anion transport within organisms, a de novo design of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) toward ultrafast anion transport is demonstrated. A phase&#8208;transfer polymerization process is developed to acquire dense and ordered alignment of quaternary ammonium&#8208;functionalized side chains along the channels within the frameworks. The resultant self&#8208;standing COFs membranes exhibit one of the highest hydroxide conductivities (212 mS cm&#8722;1 at 80 &#176;C) among the reported anion exchange membranes. Meanwhile, it is found that shorter, more hydrophilic side chains are favorable for anion conduction. The present work highlights the prospects of all&#8208;organic framework materials as the platform building blocks in designing ion exchange membranes and ion sieving membranes.

      <title>Single&#8208;Crystal SnSe Thermoelectric Fibers via Laser&#8208;Induced Directional Crystallization: From 1D Fibers to Multidimensional Fabrics</title>
      <dc:description>
Single&#8208;crystal SnSe fibers are achieved using thermal drawing and laser&#8208;induced recrystallization. The resulting single&#8208;crystal rock&#8208;salt SnSe fibers possess high thermoelectric properties, enhancing the ZT value close to 2 at 860 K, while being highly flexible, ultralong, and mechanically stable. This simple and low&#8208;cost approach engages the fiber&#8208;shaped high&#8208;performance single&#8208;crystal materials in applications from 1D fiber devices to multidimensional wearable fabrics.








Abstract
Single&#8208;crystal tin selenide (SnSe), a record holder of high&#8208;performance thermoelectric materials, enables high&#8208;efficient interconversion between heat and electricity for power generation or refrigeration. However, the rigid bulky SnSe cannot satisfy the applications for flexible and wearable devices. Here, a method is demonstrated to achieve ultralong single&#8208;crystal SnSe wire with rock&#8208;salt structure and high thermoelectric performance with diameters from micro&#8208; to nanoscale. This method starts from thermally drawing SnSe into a flexible fiber&#8208;like substrate, which is polycrystalline, highly flexible, ultralong, and mechanically stable. Then a CO2 laser is employed to recrystallize the SnSe core to single&#8208;crystal over the entire fiber. Both theoretical and experimental studies demonstrate that the single&#8208;crystal rock&#8208;salt SnSe fibers possess high thermoelectric properties, significantly enhancing the ZT value to 2 at 862 K. This simple and low&#8208;cost approach offers a promising path to engage the fiber&#8208;shaped single&#8208;crystal materials in applications from 1D fiber devices to multidimensional wearable fabrics.

      <title>Fabricating 3D Metastructures by Simultaneous Modulation of Flexible Resist Stencils and Basal Molds</title>
      <dc:description>
Orthotropic control of resist stencils and basal molds is developed to realize high&#8208;resolution true triaxial fabrication of 3D metastructures. New strategies to modulate the basal mold with high precision are realized by a controlled annealing process. A new alignment technique is also introduced to stacking the 3D metastructures with high addressability.








Abstract
Metamaterials have gained much attention thanks to their extraordinary and intriguing optical properties beyond natural materials. However, universal high&#8208;resolution fabrications of 3D micro/nanometastructures with high&#8208;resolution remain a challenge. Here, a novel approach to fabricate sophisticated 3D micro/nanostructures with excellent robustness and precise controllability is demonstrated by simultaneously modulating of flexible resist stencils and basal molds. This method allows arbitrary manipulations of morphology, size, and orientation, as well as contact angles of the objects. Combined with a new alignment strategy of high&#8208;resolution, previously inaccessible architectures are fabricated with ultrahigh precision, leading to an excellent spectra response from the fabricated metastructures. This method provides a new possibility to realize true 3D metamaterial fabrications featuring high&#8208;resolution and direct&#8208;compatibility with broad planar lithography platforms.

New strategies to modulate the basal mold with high precision are realized by a controlled annealing process. A new alignment technique is also introduced to stacking the 3D metastructures with high addressability.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metamaterials have gained much attention thanks to their extraordinary and intriguing optical properties beyond natural materials. However, universal high&#8208;resolution fabrications of 3D micro/nanometastructures with high&#8208;resolution remain a challenge. Here, a novel approach to fabricate sophisticated 3D micro/nanostructures with excellent robustness and precise controllability is demonstrated by simultaneously modulating of flexible resist stencils and basal molds. This method allows arbitrary manipulations of morphology, size, and orientation, as well as contact angles of the objects. Combined with a new alignment strategy of high&#8208;resolution, previously inaccessible architectures are fabricated with ultrahigh precision, leading to an excellent spectra response from the fabricated metastructures. This method provides a new possibility to realize true 3D metamaterial fabrications featuring high&#8208;resolution and direct&#8208;compatibility with broad planar lithography platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Large&#8208;Area Alignment of Supramolecular Columns by Photothermal Laser Writing</title>
      <dc:description>
Supramolecular columns of nanoscale periodicity (&#8776;4.75 nm) are aligned in a uniform direction over a large area by photothermal laser writing. The alignment direction of the supramolecular structures is determined by varying the laser heating conditions. Area&#8208;selective alignment is also demonstrated by local laser writing, and planar structures of supramolecular materials along the laser scanning direction at the specified areas are generated.








Abstract
Controlling the orientation of highly periodic supramolecular structures of small feature size (&lt;5 nm) is the first step for potential applications in optoelectronics, membranes, and template synthesis. A new method, namely, laser photothermal writing, is introduced to direct the orientation of supramolecular columns over a large area. Supramolecular columns consisting of taper&#8208;shaped molecules with long aliphatic tail groups are aligned by a thermal gradient, which is induced by exposing a near&#8208;infrared laser beam to a graphene photothermal conversion layer. Intriguingly, the orientation of the supramolecular columns can be controlled in a facile manner by varying the laser scanning velocity and power. In contrast to previous methodologies for aligning supramolecular structures, this laser photothermal mechanism allows the directional and continuous alignment of supramolecular structures over an arbitrary large area with the easy control of laser irradiation. Besides, the laser process also enables area&#8208;selective orientation of the supramolecular structures for device&#8208;oriented nanopatterning.

      <title>Toward Robust Macroscale Superlubricity on Engineering Steel Substrate</title>
      <dc:description>
A novel principle is proposed to assemble numberless &#8220;microscale superlubricity&#8221; into &#8220;macroscale superlubricity,&#8221; where the elaborately constructed micro&#8208;asperities of rough engineering substrate play the role of splitting macro&#8208;surface into micro&#8208;points. Then at each contact point, special measures, such as pre&#8208;running&#8208;in and heterogeneous 2D materials are devised to manipulate the interfacial ordered state, chemical interaction, and incommensurate configuration, thereby achieving robust macroscale superlubricity.








Abstract
&#8220;Structural superlubricity&#8221; is an important fundamental phenomenon in modern tribology that is expected to greatly diminish friction in mechanical engineering, but now is limited to achieve only at nanoscale and microscale in experiment. A novel principle for broadening the structural superlubricating state based on numberless micro&#8208;contact into macroscale superlubricity is demonstrated. The topography of micro&#8208;asperities on engineering steel substrates is elaborately constructed to divide the macroscale surface contact into microscale point contacts. Then at each contact point, special measures such as pre&#8208;running&#8208;in period and coating heterogeneous covalent/ionic or ionic/ionic nanocomposite of 2D materials are devised to manipulate the interfacial ordered layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer state, weak chemical interaction, and incommensurate configuration, thereby satisfying the prerequisites responsible for structural superlubricity. Finally, the robust superlubricating states on engineering steel&#8211;steel macroscale contact pairs are achieved with significantly reduced friction coefficient in 10&#8722;3 magnitude, extra&#8208;long antiwear life (more than 1.0 &#215; 106 laps), and good universality to wide range of materials and loads, which can be of significance for the industrialization of &#8220;structural superlubricity.&#8221;

      <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Framework&#8208;Derived Co2P Nanoparticle/Multi&#8208;Doped Porous Carbon as a Trifunctional Electrocatalyst</title>
      <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance trifunctional electrocatalyst which is characterized by Co2P nanoparticles embedded in Co, N, and P multi&#8208;doped carbon is developed using zeolitic imidazolate frameworks as precursors. The synergistic effect of Co2P on multi&#8208;heteroatom&#8208;doped carbon substrates provides an excellent electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction, hydrogen evolution reaction, and oxygen reduction reaction.








Abstract
Developing efficient and low&#8208;cost replacements for precious metals as electrocatalysts active in electrochemical reactions&#8212;the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)&#8212;is a top priority in renewable energy technology. In this work a highly active and very stable trifunctional electrocatalyst composed of Co2P embedded in Co, N, and P multi&#8208;doped carbon has been synthesized using zeolitic imidazolate frameworks as precursors. The synergistic effects between Co2P and the multi&#8208;heteroatom&#8208;doped carbon substrates afford materials having electrocatalytic activities for HER, OER, and ORR, which are comparable&#8212;or even superior to&#8212;those of commercial RuO2 or Pt/C catalysts. Density functional theory calculations show that Co2P has a higher density of states at the Fermi level than ConP (0 &lt; n &lt; 2), which promotes electron transfer and intermediates adsorption in the catalytic process. Zinc&#8211;air batteries and water splitting devices assembled using the materials as electrode electrocatalysts show good performance and outstanding stability. This work represents a breakthrough in improving the catalytic performance of non&#8208;precious metal electrocatalysts for OER, HER, and ORR, and opens new avenues for clean energy generation.

Abstract
Engineering novel Sn&#8208;based bimetallic materials could provide intriguing catalytic properties to boost the electrochemical CO2 reduction. Herein, the first synthesis of homogeneous Sn1&#8722;xBix alloy nanoparticles (x up to 0.20) with native Bi&#8208;doped amorphous SnOx shells for efficient CO2 reduction is reported. The Bi&#8208;SnOx nanoshells boost the production of formate with high Faradaic efficiencies (&gt;90%) over a wide potential window (&#8722;0.67 to &#8722;0.92&#160;V vs RHE) with low overpotentials, outperforming current tin oxide catalysts. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Bi&#8208;SnOx nanoshells derived from Sn0.80Bi0.20 alloy nanoparticles exhibit a great partial current density of 74.6&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and high Faradaic efficiency of 95.8%. The detailed electrocatalytic analyses and corresponding density functional theory calculations simultaneously reveal that the incorporation of Bi atoms into Sn species facilitates formate production by suppressing the formation of H2 and CO.

      <title>Bioinspired Copper Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Tumor Parallel Catalytic Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>
This work demonstrates an intriguing paradigm of tumor parallel catalytic therapy using bioinspired copper single&#8208;atom catalysts to directly catalyze O2 and H2O2 in parallel into O2&#8226;&#8722; and &#8226;OH, respectively, for the oxidation and damage of target biomolecules without external energy input, which is expected to deliver a novel therapeutic nanoplatform for clinics in the future.








Abstract
The oxidation of intracellular biomolecules by reactive oxygen species (ROS) forms the basis for ROS&#8208;based tumor therapy. However, the current therapeutic modalities cannot catalyze H2O2 and O2 concurrently for ROS generation, thereby leading to unsatisfactory therapeutic efficacy. Herein, it is reported a bioinspired hollow N&#8208;doped carbon sphere doped with a single&#8208;atom copper species (Cu&#8208;HNCS) that can directly catalyze the decomposition of both oxygen and hydrogen peroxide to ROS, namely superoxide ion (O2&#8226;&#8722;) and the hydroxyl radical (&#8226;OH), respectively, in an acidic tumor microenvironment for the oxidation of intracellular biomolecules without external energy input, thus resulting in an enhanced tumor growth inhibitory effect. Notably, the Fenton reaction turnover frequency of Cu species in Cu&#8208;HNCS is &#8776;5000 times higher than that of Fe in commercial Fe3O4 nanoparticles. Experimental results and density functional theory calculations reveal that the high catalytic activity of Cu&#8208;HNCS originates from the single&#8208;atom copper, and the calculation predicts a next&#8208;generation Fenton catalyst. This work provides an effective paradigm of tumor parallel catalytic therapy for considerably enhanced therapeutic efficacy.

&lt;p&gt;This work demonstrates an intriguing paradigm of tumor parallel catalytic therapy using bioinspired copper single&#8208;atom catalysts to directly catalyze O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in parallel into O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8226;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and &#8226;OH, respectively, for the oxidation and damage of target biomolecules without external energy input, which is expected to deliver a novel therapeutic nanoplatform for clinics in the future.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oxidation of intracellular biomolecules by reactive oxygen species (ROS) forms the basis for ROS&#8208;based tumor therapy. However, the current therapeutic modalities cannot catalyze H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concurrently for ROS generation, thereby leading to unsatisfactory therapeutic efficacy. Herein, it is reported a bioinspired hollow N&#8208;doped carbon sphere doped with a single&#8208;atom copper species (Cu&#8208;HNCS) that can directly catalyze the decomposition of both oxygen and hydrogen peroxide to ROS, namely superoxide ion (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8226;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) and the hydroxyl radical (&#8226;OH), respectively, in an acidic tumor microenvironment for the oxidation of intracellular biomolecules without external energy input, thus resulting in an enhanced tumor growth inhibitory effect. Notably, the Fenton reaction turnover frequency of Cu species in Cu&#8208;HNCS is &#8776;5000 times higher than that of Fe in commercial Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles. Experimental results and density functional theory calculations reveal that the high catalytic activity of Cu&#8208;HNCS originates from the single&#8208;atom copper, and the calculation predicts a next&#8208;generation Fenton catalyst. This work provides an effective paradigm of tumor parallel catalytic therapy for considerably enhanced therapeutic efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Multiscale Architecture and Superior High&#8208;Temperature Performance of Discontinuously Reinforced Titanium Matrix Composites</title>
      <dc:description>
Discontinuously reinforced titanium matrix composites (DRTMCs) by tailoring multiscale architectures have exposed more promising mechanical properties, including comparatively better strengthening effects, exceptional high&#8208;temperature endurability, and most importantly, decent tensile ductility. The most recent developments, including the design, fabrication, microstructure, high&#8208;temperature performance, strengthening mechanisms, and future research opportunities for composites, are reviewed.








Abstract
Discontinuously reinforced titanium matrix composites (DRTMCs), as one of the most important metal matrix composites (MMCs), are expected to exhibit high strength, elastic modulus, high&#8208;temperature endurability, wear resistance, isotropic property, and formability. Recent innovative research shows that tailoring the reinforcement network distribution totally differently from the conventional homogeneous distribution can not only improve the strengthening effect but also resolve the dilemma of DRTMCs with poor tensile ductility. Based on the network architecture, multiscale architecture, for example, two&#8208;scale network and laminate&#8208;network microstructure can further inspire superior strength, creep, and oxidation resistance at elevated temperatures. Herein, the most recent developments, which include the design, fabrication, microstructure, high&#8208;temperature performance, strengthening mechanisms, and future research opportunities for DRTMCs with multiscale architecture, are captured. In this regard, the service temperature can be increased by 200 &#176;C, and the creep rupture time by 59&#8208;fold compared with those of conventional titanium alloys, which can meet the urgent demands of lightweight nickel&#8208;based structural materials and potentially replace nickel base superalloys at 600&#8211;800 &#176;C to reduce weight by 45%. In fact, multiscale architecture design strategy will also favorably open a new era in the research of extensive metallic materials for improved performances.

      <title>Giant and Broadband Multiphoton Absorption Nonlinearities of a 2D Organometallic Perovskite Ferroelectric</title>
      <dc:description>
Giant and broadband multiphoton absorption effects are presented in 2D hybrid perovskite ferroelectric, which exhibits a record&#8208;high five&#8208;photon absorption cross&#8208;section of 1.2 &#215; 10&#8722;132 cm10 s4 photon&#8722;4, exceeding all the known ferroelectrics and being about 10 orders larger than some state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art organic molecules. This makes a breakthrough in ferroelectrics for newly conceptual photonic device applications.








Abstract
Multiphoton absorption (MPA) has been utilized for important technological applications. High&#8208;order multiphoton harvesting (e.g., five&#8208;photon absorption, 5PA) exhibits unique properties that could benefit biophotonics. Within this field, perovskite oxide ferroelectrics (e.g., BaTiO3) enable low&#8208;order optical nonlinearities of 2PA/3PA processes. However, it is challenging to obtain efficient, high&#8208;order 5PA effects. Herein, for the first time, giant and broadband MPA properties are presented in the 2D hybrid perovskite ferroelectric (IA)2(MA)2Pb3Br10 (1; IA = isoamylammonium and MA = methylammonium), where multiphoton&#8208;excited optical nonlinearities related to different MPA mechanisms over a broadband range of 550&#8211;2400 nm are observed. Strikingly, its 5PA absorption cross&#8208;section (&#963;5) reaches up to 1.2 &#215; 10&#8722;132 cm10 s4 photon&#8722;4 (at 2400 nm), almost 10 orders larger than some state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art organic molecules and a record&#8208;high value among all known ferroelectrics. This unprecedented 5PA effect results from the quantum&#8208;confined motif of inorganic trilayer sheets (wells) and organic cations (barriers) in 1. Moreover, its large ferroelectric polarization of 5 &#181;C cm&#8722;2 could promote modulation of MPA effects under external electric fields. As far as it is known, this is the first report on giant, broadband high&#8208;order MPA properties in ferroelectrics, which provides potential, novel electric&#8208;ordered materials for next&#8208;generation biophotonic applications.

      <dc:description>
The interfacial dynamics between solid electrolytes and electrodes are considered as a crucial factor in determining all&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery performance. The interfacial principle and engineering in a variety of solid&#8208;state batteries, including solid&#8208;state lithium/sodium batteries and emerging batteries, are discussed.

Abstract
Owing to the promise of high safety and energy density, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries are attracting incremental interest as one of the most promising next&#8208;generation energy storage systems. However, their widespread applications are inhibited by many technical challenges, including low&#8208;conductivity electrolytes, dendrite growth, and poor cycle/rate properties. Particularly, the interfacial dynamics between the solid electrolyte and the electrode is considered as a crucial factor in determining solid&#8208;state battery performance. In recent years, intensive research efforts have been devoted to understanding the interfacial behavior and strategies to overcome these challenges for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries. Here, the interfacial principle and engineering in a variety of solid&#8208;state batteries, including solid&#8208;state lithium/sodium batteries and emerging batteries (lithium&#8211;sulfur, lithium&#8211;air, etc.), are discussed. Specific attention is paid to interface physics (contact and wettability) and interface chemistry (passivation layer, ionic transport, dendrite growth), as well as the strategies to address the above concerns. The purpose here is to outline the current interface issues and challenges, allowing for target&#8208;oriented research for solid&#8208;state electrochemical energy storage. Current trends and future perspectives in interfacial engineering are also presented.

      <title>Tough and Multi&#8208;Recyclable Cross&#8208;Linked Supramolecular Polyureas via Incorporating Noncovalent Bonds into Main&#8208;Chains</title>
      <dc:description>
A new strategy of incorporating noncovalent bonds into main&#8208;chains is developed to construct tough and multi&#8208;recyclable cross&#8208;linked supramolecular polyureas (CSPU). After five generations of recycling processes, the mechanical properties of reprocessed CSPU can recover more than 95% of their original properties. Overall, CSPU exhibit the superior toughness, remarkable solvent resistance, high transparency, and excellent multiple recyclability.








Abstract
Covalent thermosets generally exhibit robust mechanical properties, while they are fragile and lack the ability to be reprocessed or recycled. Herein, a new strategy of incorporating noncovalent bonds into main&#8208;chains is developed to construct tough and multi&#8208;recyclable cross&#8208;linked supramolecular polyureas (CSPU), which are prepared via the copolymerization of diisocyanate monomers, noncovalently bonded diamine monomers linked by quadruple hydrogen bonds, and covalent diamine/triamine monomers. The CSPU exhibit remarkable solvent resistance and outstanding mechanical properties owing to the covalent cross&#8208;linking via triamine monomer. Through the incorporation of 9.7% and 14.6% quadruple hydrogen bonded diamine monomer, the transparent CSPU films are endowed with superior toughness of 74.17 and 124.17 MJ&#160;m&#8722;3, respectively. Impressively, even after five generations of recycling processes, the mechanical properties of reprocessed CSPU can recover more than 95% of their original properties, displaying excellent multiple recyclablity. As a result, the superior toughness, remarkable solvent resistance, high transparency, and excellent multiple recyclability are well&#8208;combined in the CSPU. It is highly anticipated that this line of research will provide a facile and general method to construct various cross&#8208;linked polymer materials with superior recyclability and mechanical properties.

Abstract
The possibility of structuring material at the nanoscale is essential to control light&#8211;matter interactions and therefore fabricate next&#8208;generation paints and coatings. In this context, nature can serve not only as a source of inspiration for the design of such novel optical structures, but also as a primary source of materials. Here, some of the strategies used in nature to optimize light&#8211;matter interaction are reviewed and some of the recent progress in the production of optical materials made solely of plant&#8208;derived building blocks is highlighted. In nature, nano&#8208; to micrometer&#8208;sized structured materials made from biopolymers are at the origin of most of the light&#8208;transport effects. How natural photonic systems manage light scattering and what can be learned from plants and animals to produce photonic materials from biopolymers are discussed. Tuning the light&#8208;scattering properties via structural variations allows a wide range of appearances to be obtained, from whiteness to transparency, using the same renewable and biodegradable building blocks. Here, various transparent and white cellulose&#8208;based materials produced so far are highlighted.

      <title>Multimode Hydraulically Amplified Electrostatic Actuators for Wearable Haptics</title>
      <dc:description>
Hydraulically amplified zipping taxels (HAXELs) are thin, soft fluidically coupled electrostatic actuators, generating both out&#8208;of&#8208;plane and in&#8208;plane motion, delivering rich haptic sensations by locally applying normal and shear forces to the skin. A 90 mg actuator generates 300 mN of force and 500 &#181;m displacement in under 5 ms. Arrays of wearable HAXELs provide a realistic sense of touch.








Abstract
The sense of touch is underused in today&#8217;s virtual reality systems due to lack of wearable, soft, mm&#8208;scale transducers to generate dynamic mechanical stimulus on the skin. Extremely thin actuators combining both high force and large displacement are a long&#8208;standing challenge in soft actuators. Sub&#8208;mm thick flexible hydraulically amplified electrostatic actuators are reported here, capable of both out&#8208;of&#8208;plane and in&#8208;plane motion, providing normal and shear forces to the user&#8217;s fingertip, hand, or arm. Each actuator consists of a fluid&#8208;filled cavity whose shell is made of a metalized polyester boundary and a central elastomer region. When a voltage is applied to the annular electrodes, the fluid is rapidly forced into the stretchable region, forming a raised bump. A 6 mm &#215; 6 mm &#215; 0.8 mm actuator weighs 90 mg, and generates forces of over 300 mN, out&#8208;of&#8208;plane displacements of 500 &#181;m (over 60% strain), and lateral motion of 760 &#181;m. Response time is below 5 ms, for a specific power of 100 W kg&#8722;1. In user tests, human subjects distinguished normal and different 2&#8208;axis shear forces with over 80% accuracy. A flexible 5 &#215; 5 array is demonstrated, integrated in a haptic sleeve.

      <title>3D Printing of Microgel&#8208;Loaded Modular Microcages as Instructive Scaffolds for Tissue Engineering</title>
      <dc:description>
Novel 3D printed microcages that can be easily assembled via simple stacking to fit the complexity of various tissue defects are introduced. Individual microcage units allow for spatial loading of biomolecules to instruct site&#8208;specific cell migration three&#8208;dimensionally and facilitate neovascularization in vivo, thus accelerating the process of healing.








Abstract
Biomaterial scaffolds have served as the foundation of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. However, scaffold systems are often difficult to scale in size or shape in order to fit defect&#8208;specific dimensions, and thus provide only limited spatiotemporal control of therapeutic delivery and host tissue responses. Here, a lithography&#8208;based 3D printing strategy is used to fabricate a novel miniaturized modular microcage scaffold system, which can be assembled and scaled manually with ease. Scalability is based on an intuitive concept of stacking modules, like conventional toy interlocking plastic blocks, allowing for literally thousands of potential geometric configurations, and without the need for specialized equipment. Moreover, the modular hollow&#8208;microcage design allows each unit to be loaded with biologic cargo of different compositions, thus enabling controllable and easy patterning of therapeutics within the material in 3D. In summary, the concept of miniaturized microcage designs with such straight&#8208;forward assembly and scalability, as well as controllable loading properties, is a flexible platform that can be extended to a wide range of materials for improved biological performance.

      <title>Antineoplastic Drug&#8208;Free Anticancer Strategy Enabled by Host&#8208;Defense&#8208;Peptides&#8208;Mimicking Synthetic Polypeptides</title>
      <dc:description>
An antineoplastic drug&#8208;free anticancer strategy enabled by host defense peptides (HDPs)&#8208;mimicking synthetic polypeptides is proposed. The synthetic anticancer polypeptides (ACPP) exhibit broad&#8208;spectrum anticancer activity through an HDPs&#8208;like membrane&#8208;lytic mechanism. Modification of ACPP with 2,3&#8208;dimethylmaleic anhydride (DA) generates a pH&#8208;sensitive zwitterionic derivative, DA&#8208;ACPP, with improved biocompatibility, which can selectively lyse tumors in vivo after being activated in acidic tumor microenvironment.








Abstract
An antineoplastic drug&#8208;free anticancer strategy enabled by host defense peptides (HDPs)&#8208;mimicking synthetic polypeptides is reported. The polypeptide exhibits a broad spectrum of anticancer activity in 12 cancer cell lines, including drug&#8208;resistant and highly metastatic tumor cells. Detailed mechanistic studies reveal that the cationic anticancer polypeptide (ACPP) can directly induce rapid necrosis of cancer cells within minutes through a membrane&#8208;lytic mechanism. Moreover, a pH&#8208;sensitive zwitterionic derivative of ACPP (DA&#8208;ACPP) is prepared for in vivo application. DA&#8208;ACPP shows negligible hemolysis under neutral physiological conditions, and can be converted back to ACPP in slightly acidic tumor environments, resulting in selective killing of cancer cells. Consequently, DA&#8208;ACPP shows an effective inhibition of tumor growth in both 4T1 orthotopic breast tumor models and B16&#8208;F10 melanoma pulmonary metastatic models. Overall, these findings demonstrate that synthetic HDPs&#8208;mimicking polypeptides represent safe and effective antineoplastic agents, which sheds new light on the development of drug&#8208;free synthetic polymers for cancer therapy.

      <title>2D Materials Decorated with Ultra&#8208;Thin and Porous Graphene Oxide for High Stability and Selective Surface Activity</title>
      <dc:description>
&#8220;Janus&#8208;like&#8221; 2D porous heterostructures are described for realizing ultra&#8208;stable surface reactivity of chemiresistive 2D materials as proven by chemical sensing case study and multiscale simulations. The few&#8208;layered holey graphene oxide passivation layer effectively shields black phosphorous and MXene from oxidative degradation, while allowing the selective diffusion of NO2 molecules toward the underlying 2D sensing materials.








Abstract
2D black phosphorous (BP) and MXenes have triggered enormous research interest in catalysis, energy storage, and chemical sensing. Unfortunately, the low stability of these materials under practical operating conditions remains a critical bottleneck, particularly as they are prone to oxidization under moisture. In this work, the design and application of stable 2D heterostructures obtained from decorating BP and MXene (Ti3C2Tx) with few&#8208;layer holey graphene oxide (FHGO) membranes are presented. In the resulting heterostructured systems, FHGO serves as a multifunctional passivation layer that shields BP or MXene from oxidative degradation, while allowing the selective diffusion of target gas molecules through its micropores and toward the underlying 2D material. Through a case study of dilute NO2 sensing, it is demonstrated that these heterostructures show a greatly enhanced sensing performance under humid conditions, where fast sensing speed and response are consistently observed, and high stability is impressively retained upon repetitive sensing cycles for 1000 min. These results corroborate the efficacy of material decoration with porous FHGO membranes and suggest that this is a generalizable strategy for reliable high&#8208;performance applications of 2D materials.

      <title>An Atomically Thin Optoelectronic Machine Vision Processor</title>
      <dc:description>
2D materials have been extensively studied for electronic and optoelectronic applications. A 2D optoelectronic machine vision processor is demonstrated by integrating 1024 MoS2 photo&#8208;FETs in a crossbar structure. This vision processor mimics two core functions of human vision: image sensing like the eyes and recognition like the brain, demonstrating visual recognition of 1000 handwritten numbers.








Abstract
2D semiconductors, especially transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers, are extensively studied for electronic and optoelectronic applications. Beyond intensive studies on single transistors and photodetectors, the recent advent of large&#8208;area synthesis of these atomically thin layers has paved the way for 2D integrated circuits, such as digital logic circuits and image sensors, achieving an integration level of &#8776;100 devices thus far. Here, a decisive advance in 2D integrated circuits is reported, where the device integration scale is increased by tenfold and the functional complexity of 2D electronics is propelled to an unprecedented level.

     alt="An Atomically Thin Optoelectronic Machine Vision Processor"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2D materials have been extensively studied for electronic and optoelectronic applications. A 2D optoelectronic machine vision processor is demonstrated by integrating 1024 MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photo&#8208;FETs in a crossbar structure. This vision processor mimics two core functions of human vision: image sensing like the eyes and recognition like the brain, demonstrating visual recognition of 1000 handwritten numbers.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2D semiconductors, especially transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers, are extensively studied for electronic and optoelectronic applications. Beyond intensive studies on single transistors and photodetectors, the recent advent of large&#8208;area synthesis of these atomically thin layers has paved the way for 2D integrated circuits, such as digital logic circuits and image sensors, achieving an integration level of &#8776;100 devices thus far. Here, a decisive advance in 2D integrated circuits is reported, where the device integration scale is increased by tenfold and the functional complexity of 2D electronics is propelled to an unprecedented level. Concretely, an analog optoelectronic processor inspired by biological vision is developed, where 32 &#215; 32 = 1024 MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photosensitive field&#8208;effect transistors manifesting persistent photoconductivity (PPC) effects are arranged in a crossbar array. This optoelectronic processor with PPC memory mimics two core functions of human vision: it captures and stores an optical image into electrical data, like the eye and optic nerve chain, and then recognizes this electrical form of the captured image, like the brain, by executing analog in&#8208;memory neural net computing.

      <title>Coherent Perfect Diffraction in Metagratings</title>
      <dc:description>
Coherent control of metagratings through multiple wave excitations is shown to provide new opportunities for highly reconfigurable broadband metasurfaces with unitary diffraction efficiency.








Abstract
Metasurfaces are 2D engineered structures with subwavelength granularity, offering a wide range of opportunities to tailor the impinging wavefront. However, fundamental limitations on their efficiency in wave transformation, associated with their deeply subwavelength thickness, challenge their implementation in practical application scenarios. Here, it is shown how the coherent control of metagratings through multiple wave excitations can provide new opportunities to achieve highly reconfigurable broadband metasurfaces with large diffraction efficiency, beyond the limitations of conventional approaches. Remarkably, energy distribution between the 0th and higher diffraction orders can be continuously tuned by changing the relative phase difference between two excitation waves, enabling coherent control, with added benefits of enhanced efficiency and bandwidth. This concept is demonstrated for a thin electric metagrating operating at terahertz frequencies, showing that coherent control can overcome several of the limitations of single&#8208;layer ultrathin metastructures, and extend their feasibility in various practical scenarios.

      <title>A Thermal Radiation Modulation Platform by Emissivity Engineering with Graded Metal&#8211;Insulator Transition</title>
      <dc:description>
Unprecedented manipulation of infrared radiation is achieved by an unusual material platform based on thin films of vanadium dioxide where tungsten is judiciously graded doped across a thickness of &lt;100 nm. The platform enables various infrared applications including a flexible and power&#8208;free infrared camouflage with unique advantages, as well as a novel technology named &#8220;infrared decoy.&#8221;








Abstract
Thermal radiation from a black body increases with the fourth power of absolute temperature (T4), an effect known as the Stefan&#8211;Boltzmann law. Typical materials radiate heat at a portion of this limit, where the portion, called integrated emissivity (&#949;int), is insensitive to temperature (|d&#949;int/dT| &#8776; 10&#8722;4 &#176;C&#8211;1). The resultant radiance bound by the T4 law limits the ability to regulate radiative heat. Here, an unusual material platform is shown in which &#949;int can be engineered to decrease in an arbitrary manner near room temperature (|d&#949;int/dT| &#8776; 8 &#215; 10&#8722;3 &#176;C&#8211;1), enabling unprecedented manipulation of infrared radiation. As an example, &#949;int is programmed to vary with temperature as the inverse of T4, precisely counteracting the T4 dependence; hence, thermal radiance from the surface becomes temperature&#8208;independent, allowing the fabrication of flexible and power&#8208;free infrared camouflage with unique advantage in performance stability. The structure is based on thin films of tungsten&#8208;doped vanadium dioxide where the tungsten fraction is judiciously graded across a thickness less than the skin depth of electromagnetic screening.

      <title>High&#8208;Performance Nonvolatile Organic Photonic Transistor Memory Devices using Conjugated Rod&#8211;Coil Materials as a Floating Gate</title>
      <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance photonic transistor memory devices are fabricated using conjugated rod&#8211;coil materials as a photoactive floating gate, in which the conjugated rods and side&#8208;chain coils act as charge&#8208;trapping and tunneling moieties, respectively. By inheriting their self&#8208;assembled structure, both n&#8208;type and p&#8208;type memory devices exhibit a fast response, a current contrast over 105, and an extremely low programing driving force of 0.1 V.








Abstract
A novel approach for using conjugated rod&#8211;coil materials as a floating gate in the fabrication of nonvolatile photonic transistor memory devices, consisting of n&#8208;type Sol&#8208;PDI and p&#8208;type C10&#8208;DNTT, is presented. Sol&#8208;PDI and C10&#8208;DNTT are used as dual functions of charge&#8208;trapping (conjugated rod) and tunneling (insulating coil), while n&#8208;type BPE&#8208;PDI and p&#8208;type DNTT are employed as the corresponding transporting layers. By using the same conjugated rod in the memory layer and transporting channel with a self&#8208;assembled structure, both n&#8208;type and p&#8208;type memory devices exhibit a fast response, a high current contrast between &#8220;Photo&#8208;On&#8221; and &#8220;Electrical&#8208;Off&#8221; bistable states over 105, and an extremely low programing driving force of 0.1 V. The fabricated photon&#8208;driven memory devices exhibit a quick response to different wavelengths of light and a broadband light response that highlight their promising potential for light&#8208;recorder and synaptic device applications.

      <title>Surface&#8208;Mediated Interconnections of Nanoparticles in Cellulosic Fibrous Materials toward 3D Sensors</title>
      <dc:description>
To create 3D fibrous sensors, surface&#8208;mediated interconnection of bimodally distributed gold&#8211;copper alloy nanoclusters and nanoparticles (NPs) is exploited as an effective pathway to fabricate embedded microelectrodes in the cellulosic fibrous materials. This pathway is further coupled to surface&#8208;mediated assembly of the NPs to produce chemically sensitive interfaces to targeted gases/vaporous analytes.








Abstract
Fibrous materials serve as an intriguing class of 3D materials to meet the growing demands for flexible, foldable, biocompatible, biodegradable, disposable, inexpensive, and wearable sensors and the rising desires for higher sensitivity, greater miniaturization, lower cost, and better wearability. The use of such materials for the creation of a fibrous sensor substrate that interfaces with a sensing film in 3D with the transducing electronics is however difficult by conventional photolithographic methods. Here, a highly effective pathway featuring surface&#8208;mediated interconnection (SMI) of metal nanoclusters (NCs) and nanoparticles (NPs) in fibrous materials at ambient conditions is demonstrated for fabricating fibrous sensor substrates or platforms. Bimodally distributed gold&#8211;copper alloy NCs and NPs are used as a model system to demonstrate the semiconductive&#8208;to&#8208;metallic conductivity transition, quantized capacitive charging, and anisotropic conductivity characteristics. Upon coupling SMI of NCs/NPs as electrically conductive microelectrodes and surface&#8208;mediated assembly (SMA) of the NCs/NPs as chemically sensitive interfaces, the resulting fibrous chemiresistors function as sensitive and selective sensors for gaseous and vaporous analytes. This new SMI&#8211;SMA strategy has significant implications for manufacturing high&#8208;performance fibrous platforms to meet the growing demands of the advanced multifunctional sensors and biosensors.

      <title>Long&#8208;Range Ordered Amorphous Atomic Chains as Building Blocks of a Superconducting Quasi&#8208;One&#8208;Dimensional Crystal</title>
      <dc:description>
Combination of long&#8208;range ordered and short&#8208;range disordered structures at the atomic level is demonstrated for a quasi&#8208;1D linear chain compound. Under compression, the constituent atomic chains of the material are amorphized without breaking the orientational and periodic translation symmetries of the chain lattice. This lattice of amorphous atomic chains hosts a quantum condensate of Cooper pairs.








Abstract
Crystalline and amorphous structures are two of the most common solid&#8208;state phases. Crystals having orientational and periodic translation symmetries are usually both short&#8208;range and long&#8208;range ordered, while amorphous materials have no long&#8208;range order. Short&#8208;range ordered but long&#8208;range disordered materials are generally categorized into amorphous phases. In contrast to the extensively studied crystalline and amorphous phases, the combination of short&#8208;range disordered and long&#8208;range ordered structures at the atomic level is extremely rare and so far has only been reported for solvated fullerenes under compression.&#160;Here, a report on the creation and investigation of a superconducting quasi&#8208;1D material with long&#8208;range ordered amorphous building blocks is presented. Using a diamond anvil cell, monocrystalline (TaSe4)2I is compressed and a system is created where the TaSe4 atomic chains are in amorphous state without breaking the orientational and periodic translation symmetries of the chain lattice. Strikingly, along with the amorphization of the atomic chains, the insulating (TaSe4)2I becomes a superconductor. The data provide critical insight into a new phase of solid&#8208;state materials. The findings demonstrate a first ever case where superconductivity is hosted by a lattice with periodic but amorphous constituent atomic chains.

     alt="Long&#8208;Range Ordered Amorphous Atomic Chains as Building Blocks of a Superconducting Quasi&#8208;One&#8208;Dimensional Crystal"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combination of long&#8208;range ordered and short&#8208;range disordered structures at the atomic level is demonstrated for a quasi&#8208;1D linear chain compound. Under compression, the constituent atomic chains of the material are amorphized without breaking the orientational and periodic translation symmetries of the chain lattice. This lattice of amorphous atomic chains hosts a quantum condensate of Cooper pairs.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crystalline and amorphous structures are two of the most common solid&#8208;state phases. Crystals having orientational and periodic translation symmetries are usually both short&#8208;range and long&#8208;range ordered, while amorphous materials have no long&#8208;range order. Short&#8208;range ordered but long&#8208;range disordered materials are generally categorized into amorphous phases. In contrast to the extensively studied crystalline and amorphous phases, the combination of short&#8208;range disordered and long&#8208;range ordered structures at the atomic level is extremely rare and so far has only been reported for solvated fullerenes under compression.&#160;Here, a report on the creation and investigation of a superconducting quasi&#8208;1D material with long&#8208;range ordered amorphous building blocks is presented. Using a diamond anvil cell, monocrystalline (TaSe&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I is compressed and a system is created where the TaSe&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; atomic chains are in amorphous state without breaking the orientational and periodic translation symmetries of the chain lattice. Strikingly, along with the amorphization of the atomic chains, the insulating (TaSe&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I becomes a superconductor. The data provide critical insight into a new phase of solid&#8208;state materials. The findings demonstrate a first ever case where superconductivity is hosted by a lattice with periodic but amorphous constituent atomic chains.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Applications of Zeolites to C1 Chemistry: Recent Advances, Challenges, and Opportunities</title>
      <dc:description>
Zeolite catalysts play a pivotal role in C1 chemistry including conversion of CO, CO2, CH4, CH3OH, and HCOOH into various hydrocarbons (e.g., methane, lower olefins, aromatics, and liquid fuels) and oxygenates (e.g., methanol, dimethyl ether, formic acid, and higher alcohols) to meet the demand for energy and chemicals as crude oil reserves decline.








Abstract
C1 chemistry, which is the catalytic transformation of C1 molecules including CO, CO2, CH4, CH3OH, and HCOOH, plays an important role in providing energy and chemical supplies while meeting environmental requirements. Zeolites are highly efficient solid catalysts used in the chemical industry. The design and development of zeolite&#8208;based mono&#8208;, bi&#8208;, and multifunctional catalysts has led to a booming application of zeolite&#8208;based catalysts to C1 chemistry. Combining the advantages of zeolites and metallic catalytic species has promoted the catalytic production of various hydrocarbons (e.g., methane, light olefins, aromatics, and liquid fuels) and oxygenates (e.g., methanol, dimethyl ether, formic acid, and higher alcohols) from C1 molecules. The key zeolite descriptors that influence catalytic performance, such as framework topologies, nanoconfinement effects, Br&#248;nsted acidities, secondary&#8208;pore systems, particle sizes, extraframework cations and atoms, hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity, and proximity between acid and metallic sites are discussed to provide a deep understanding of the significance of zeolites to C1 chemistry. An outlook regarding challenges and opportunities for the conversion of C1 resources using zeolite&#8208;based catalysts to meet emerging energy and environmental demands is also presented.

      <title>Record Enhancement of Phase Transition Temperature Realized by H/F Substitution</title>
      <dc:description>
From (1&#8208;azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane)CdCl3, a molecular design strategy of H/F substitution is applied to synthesize a multiaxial organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite ferroelectric (4&#8208;fluoro&#8208;1&#8208;azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane)CdCl3. The phase transition temperature is successfully increased from 190 to 419&#160;K, which is a record enhancement of 229&#160;K for molecular ferroelectrics, significantly outperforming those induced by the isotope effect and other techniques.








Abstract
A high transition temperature (Tc) is essential for the practical application of ferroelectrics as electronic devices under extreme thermal conditions in the aerospace, automotive, and energy industries. In recent decades, the isotope effect and strain engineering are found to effectively modulate Tc; however, these strategies are limited to certain systems. Developing simple, universal, and practical methods to improve Tc has become an imminent challenge for expanding the applications of ferroelectrics. Here, by adopting a molecular design strategy involving H/F substitution on an organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite (1&#8208;azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane)CdCl3 at a Tc of 190&#160;K, the successful synthesis of a multiaxial, ferroelectric hybrid perovskite (4&#8208;fluoro&#8208;1&#8208;azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane)CdCl3 is reported, which demonstrates a large spontaneous polarization of 11.2&#160;&#181;C&#160;cm&#8722;2 (greater than that of polyvinylidene difluoride) and a Tc of 419&#160;K (greater than that of BaTiO3). This temperature enhancement (229&#160;K) is the largest reported for molecular ferroelectrics, far exceeding the reported enhancements induced by the isotope effect and other techniques. This pioneering technique provides an effective and universal method for improving Tc in ferroelectrics and represents an important step toward the development of high&#8208;performance ferroelectric technology.

      <title>Comprehensive Electrical Control of Metamagnetic Transition of a Quasi&#8208;2D Antiferromagnet by In Situ Anisotropic Strain</title>
      <dc:description>
Effective nonmagnetic control of the spin structure is at the forefront of the study for functional quantum materials. This study demonstrates that an in situ anisotropic strain of less than 0.1% is able to fully tune the metamagnetic transition of Sr2IrO4 by almost 300%, which enables electrically controllable and electronically detectable metamagnetic switching in this excellent prototype of antiferromagnetic spintronic.








Abstract
Effective nonmagnetic control of the spin structure is at the forefront of the study for functional quantum materials. This study demonstrates that, by applying an anisotropic strain up to only 0.05%, the metamagnetic transition field of spin&#8211;orbit&#8208;coupled Mott insulator Sr2IrO4 can be in situ modulated by almost 300%. Simultaneous measurements of resonant X&#8208;ray scattering and transport reveal that this drastic response originates from the complete strain&#8208;tuning of the transition between the spin&#8208;flop and spin&#8208;flip limits, and is always accompanied by large elastoconductance and magnetoconductance. This enables electrically controllable and electronically detectable metamagnetic switching, despite the antiferromagnetic insulating state. The obtained strain&#8208;magnetic field phase diagram reveals that C4&#8208;symmetry&#8208;breaking anisotropy is introduced by strain via pseudospin&#8208;lattice coupling, directly demonstrating the pseudo&#8208;Jahn&#8211;Teller effect of spin&#8211;orbit&#8208;coupled complex oxides. The extracted coupling strength is much weaker than the superexchange interactions, yet crucial for the spontaneous symmetry&#8208;breaking, affording the remarkably efficient strain&#8208;control.

      <title>Unraveling the Crystallization Kinetics of 2D Perovskites with Sandwich&#8208;Type Structure for High&#8208;Performance Photovoltaics</title>
      <dc:description>
An in situ grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering experiment is conducted to reveal the crystallization kinetics and formation mechanism of 2D perovskite films, during which additives play a key role in regulating the nucleation and growth process. For the dual additive processing case, a novel sandwich&#8208;type structure is achieved, which can effectively passivate defects at dual interfaces, finally resulting in a high device efficiency of 16.48%.








Abstract
2D perovskite solar cells with high stability and high efficiency have attracted significant attention. A systematical static and dynamic structure investigation is carried out to show the details of 2D morphology evolution. A dual additive approach is used, where the synergy between an alkali metal cation and a polar solvent leads to high&#8208;quality 2D perovskite films with sandwich&#8208;type structures and vertical phase segregation. Such novel structure can induce high&#8208;quality 2D slab growth and reduce internal and surface defects, resulting in a high device efficiency of 16.48% with enhanced continuous illumination stability and improved moisture (55&#8211;60%) and thermal (85&#160;&#176;C) tolerances. Transient absorption spectra reveal the carrier migration from low n to high n species with different kinetics. An [PbI6]4&#8722; octagon coalescence transformation mechanism coupled with metal and organic cations wrapped is proposed. By solvent vapor annealing, a recrystallization and reorientation of the 2D perovskite slabs occurs to form an ideal structure with improved device performance and stability.

Acoustic metamaterials with artificial microstructures are attractive to realize intriguing functions, including efficient waveguiding, which requires large impedance mismatches to realize total side reflection with negligible transmission and absorption. While large impedance mismatch can be readily realized in an air environment, acoustic waveguiding in an underwater environment remains elusive due to insufficient impedance mismatch of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art metamaterials. Here, a superhydrophobic acoustic metasurface of microstructured poly(vinylidene fluoride) membrane, referred to as a &#8220;meta&#8208;skin&#8221; insulator, which is able to confine acoustic waves in an all&#8208;angle and wide spectrum range due to tremendous impedance mismatch at stable air/water interfaces, viz., the Cassie&#8211;Baxter state is demonstrated. By utilizing the meta&#8208;skin insulator with broadband and high throughput, orbital&#8208;angular&#8208;momentum multiplexing at a high spectral efficiency and binary coding along large&#8208;angle bending channels for bit&#8208;error&#8208;free acoustic data transmission in an underwater environment are demonstrated. Very different from optical and/or electrical cable communications, acoustic waves can be simply and effectively coupled into remote meta&#8208;skin acoustic fibers from free space, which is technologically significant for long&#8208;haul and anti&#8208;interference communication. This work can enlighten many fluidic applications based on efficient waveguiding, such as in vivo ultrasound medical treatment and imaging.

&lt;p&gt;Underwater acoustic wave confinement in an all&#8208;angle and wide spectrum range can be realized in a meta&#8208;skin insulator due to the tremendous impedance mismatch originating from the stable Cassie&#8211;Baxter state. Acoustic&#8208;wave&#8208;based underwater orbital&#8208;angular&#8208;momentum multiplexing and binary coding are implemented, which is promising for long&#8208;haul and anti&#8208;interference communication. This work also benefits in vivo ultrasound medical treatment and imaging.
