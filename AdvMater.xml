         <title>Multispectrum Electromagnetic Response in FeNiHo/C Heterodimensional Structure for Microwave Absorption and Multimode Photodetection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper reports a novel FeNiHo/C hierarchical heterodimensional structured with multispectrum&#8208;coupling electromagnetic response. Through multi&#8208;scale polar heterointerface engineering, the heterodimensional structure achieves ultra&#8208;broadband microwave absorption, in situ microwave frequency&#8208;agile property, and multimode photodetections. These results inspire the development of electromagnetic multifunctional materials.








Abstract
Multispectrum response technology is the key to developing multifunctional electromagnetic devices in cross&#8208;field applications. Traditional methods rely on integrating complex multi&#8208;material systems, leading to bulkier and costlier devices. Here, a hierarchical heterodimensional structure composed of FeNiHo alloy and carbon matrix achieves autonomous multispectrum&#8208;coupling electromagnetic response between microwave and ultraviolet through polar interface engineering. In the microwave band, the heterodimensional structure exhibits outstanding microwave absorption performance with high reflection loss of &#8722;46.87 dB and ultra&#8208;wide absorption bandwidth of 8.96 GHz. Furthermore, the antenna arrays based on the heterodimensional structure demonstrate in situ microwave frequency&#8208;agile property by a coupled ultraviolet stimulation, where the largest frequency modulation range reaches 5.05 GHz in Ku&#8208;band. In the ultraviolet band, multimode photodetectors constructed by the heterodimensional structure possess excellent responsivity and accurate decoding ability for anti&#8208;interference ultraviolet communication. Particularly, the metamaterial detector achieves analog signal communication for the first time by microwave&#8208;ultraviolet coupling response. This work pioneers a novel approach to developing multifunctional electromagnetic materials for multispectrum applications.

         <title>2D Molybdenum Disulfide Embedded Photonic Crystal Fiber for all&#8208;Fiber Phase Retarder</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A material&#8208;induced birefringence is successfully achieved through selective vapor deposition of monolayer MoS2 in photonic crystal fibers (PCFs). The position&#8208;specific MoS2 films efficiently break the degeneracy of polarization modes and enable phase retardation with a manageable beat length. The as&#8208;fabricated MoS2&#8208;PCF phase retarder reliably works in variable conditions, including outdoor exposure, large deformation, and high temperature/humidity.









Abstract
The integration of 2D materials with optical fibers enables multifunctional fiber devices, such as polarizers, modulators, and sensors. Recent advances in direct vapor deposition growth further enhance light&#8208;2D material interactions to centimeter&#8208;scale lengths, overcoming the micrometer&#8208;scale limitations of transferred 2D materials. However, conventional methods for growing 2D materials in fibers typically produce isotropic material architectures due to uniform precursor deposition, limiting applications that require birefringence, such as a phase retarder. Here, a selective vapor deposition method is proposed to realize the non&#8208;circular symmetric growth of 2D molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) into photonic crystal fibers (PCFs), achieving anisotropy&#8208;engineered phase retardation. The high refractive index of MoS2 efficiently breaks the degeneracy of polarization modes in PCF and enables phase retardation with a manageable beat length of &#8776;7.7&#160;cm. The MoS2&#8208;PCF phase retarder reliably works in varying conditions, including outdoor exposure, large deformation, and high temperature/humidity. Its phase retardation exhibits an extremely small fluctuation of &#8776;3.3&#176; between 25 and 200&#160;&#176;C, which is two orders of magnitude lower than that of commercial polarization&#8208;maintaining fibers (&#8776;2.0&#176;/&#176;C). The work provides a new solution for the fiber device preparation and pave the way for robust polarization manipulation in all&#8208;fiber systems.

         <title>Lanthanide&#8208;Containing Bilayer Polymers With Programmable Wrinkling Dynamics Coherent With Visible Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bilayer polymers comprising lanthanide&#8208;coordinated skins and polyurethane substrates exhibit programmable wrinkling dynamics during relaxation. The evolving surface topography modulates visible light, enabling transitions among scattering, iridescence, and transparency. Independently, the metallopolymer layer emits multicolor luminescence under UV light. These features offer a durable, rewritable, dual&#8208;mode anti&#8208;counterfeiting platform with high adaptability and spatiotemporal control.








Abstract
A family of lanthanide metallopolymer/polyurethane bilayer polymers exhibiting multicolor luminescence and tunable wrinkling behavior are engineered to combat escalating challenges in information forgery and data leakage. These architectures are fabricated by spin&#8208;coating a lanthanide&#8208;coordinated metallopolymer skin layer onto a polyurethane substrate, facilitating strained&#8208;induced topographical transformations through a tensile&#8208;release process. During dynamic relaxation, the emergent wrinkled topographies modulate optical diffraction, yielding three distinct states: diffuse scattering (frosted glass effect), constructive interference (iridescent rainbow effect), and optical transparency. The metallopolymer skin layer demonstrates high&#8208;efficiency luminescence with broad&#8208;spectrum chromatic emission, while the polyurethane substrate confers exceptional mechanical robustness, optical transparency, and intrinsic self&#8208;healing properties. Consequently, a dual&#8208;mode anti&#8208;counterfeiting platform integrating luminescence and structural coloration is realized, offering facile activation, immediate visual verification, and enhanced durability with recyclability. These multifunctional materials exhibit superior performance metrics in encryption and hierarchical anti&#8208;counterfeiting paradigms, surpassing contemporary security technologies in adaptability and functional sophistication.

         <title>MUTE&#8208;Seq: An Ultrasensitive Method for Detecting Low&#8208;Frequency Mutations in cfDNA With Engineered Advanced&#8208;Fidelity FnCas9</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An advanced&#8208;fidelity CRISPR nuclease, FnCas9&#8208;AF2, is rationally engineered to discriminate single&#8208;base mismatches with unprecedented level precision. Integrated into the MUTE&#8208;Seq workflow, FnCas9&#8208;AF2 depletes wild&#8208;type cell&#8208;free DNA, thereby exposing rare tumor&#8208;derived mutant DNA (a molecular &#8220;needle in a haystack&#8221;). The method enables ultrasensitive, cost&#8208;efficient detection of low&#8208;frequency mutations for liquid&#8208;biopsy cancer diagnostics, supporting early detection, companion diagnosis, and MRD monitoring.








Abstract
In this study, we present the development of the Mutation tagging by CRISPR&#8208;based Ultra&#8208;precise Targeted Elimination in Sequencing (MUTE&#8208;Seq) method. We engineered a highly precise advanced&#8208;fidelity FnCas9 variant, named FnCas9&#8208;AF2, to effectively discriminate single&#8208;base mismatches at all positions of the single guide RNA (sgRNA) target sequences. FnCas9&#8208;AF2 exhibited significantly lower off&#8208;target effects compared to existing high&#8208;fidelity CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 variants. MUTE&#8208;Seq leverages FnCas9&#8208;AF2 for the enrichment of mutant DNA through the exclusive cleavage of perfectly matched wild&#8208;type DNA, allowing for sensitive detection of low&#8208;frequency cancer&#8208;associated mutant alleles. MUTE&#8208;Seq enabled sensitive monitoring of minimal residual disease (MRD) from the bone marrow of patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). Furthermore, MUTE&#8208;Seq was applied in a multiplexed manner on cell&#8208;free DNA (cfDNA) from patients diagnosed with non&#8208;small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and pancreatic cancer. This approach demonstrated a significant improvement in the sensitivity of simultaneous mutant detection and highlighted its clinical utility for early&#8208;stage cancer patients with extremely low levels of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). We anticipate that the FnCas9&#8208;AF2&#8208;based MUTE&#8208;Seq could offer a valuable clinical tool to facilitate improved molecular diagnosis, prognosis evaluation, and treatment planning for cancers in various stages.

Redefining Surface Chemistry
Oleylammonium halides, traditionally viewed as surface passivation agents, are revealed here as powerful inducers of structural transformation in all&#8208;inorganic CsPbBr3 perovskite nanocrystals. Leveraging this insight, Tze Chien Sum and coworkers introduce in article number 2500349 a simple, low&#8208;cost in situ core&#8208;shell self&#8208;assembly strategy to synthesize monodisperse, water&#8208;dispersible perovskite nanocrystals. These nanocrystals exhibit unprecedented single&#8208;photon emission in aqueous environments, opening new avenues for underwater quantum light sources.

Adaptive Cation&#8208;Selective Interfaces
An adaptive integrated interface structure has been developed, which couples time&#8208;dependent solvent evaporation with the spatial sedimentation of the transduction material. This structure utilizes lipophilic molybdenum disulfide as a component of the ion&#8208;selective membrane (ISM), which seamlessly connects a meticulously uniform ISM on the top with the transduction layer below, achieving the highly stable detection of general cations. More details can be found in article number 2501749 by Zong&#8208;Yin Song, Meng Yang, Pei&#8208;Hua Li, Xing&#8208;Jiu Huang, and co&#8208;workers.

Hollow Core&#8208;Shell Nanoreactors
In article number 2502977, Jian Liu, Sheng Ye, and co&#8208;authors report a hollow core&#8208;shell structured 2H@1T&#8208;MoS2&#8208;Sn1 nanoreactor, which features a metallic 1T&#8208;MoS2 shell encapsulating a semiconducting 2H&#8208;MoS2 core. This structure forms a Mott&#8208;Schottky phase junction that drives dynamic charge redistribution, while surface&#8208;anchored Sn single atoms within Sn&#8208;S2&#8208;Mo motifs accelerate catalytic kinetics.

Nanosheets for Multifunctional Energy Applications
In article number 2505700, Ben Xu, Daofeng Sun, and co&#8208;workers present a scalable strategy for synthesizing 2D ultrathin MOF/GO/MOF (MGM) sandwich&#8208;like nanosheets using Ni/Co&#8208;BDC frameworks with GO as a structure&#8208;directing agent. In a single batch, 1 kg of MGM nanosheets is obtained with a 98.73% metal&#8208;based yield. The universality of this method is demonstrated across multiple ligands. The resulting MGM7 nanosheets exhibit outstanding electrochemical and catalytic performance in basic zinc batteries, sodium&#8208;ion batteries, and oxygen evolution.

Drug Development in Peritoneal Metastases
Clinically effective treatments for peritoneal metastases (PM) remain a significant unmet need. In their study, Chin&#8208;Ann Johnny Ong, Eliza Li Shan Fong, and co&#8208;workers cultured patient&#8208;derived tumor explants using hydrogels, and added patient ascites fluid to mimic the actual environment in the body. More details can be found in article number 1418647.

Single&#8208;Cell Seq&#8208;Guided Therapeutic Strategy for Acute Pancreatitis
This study using single&#8208;cell sequencing first revealed that neutrophil N1/N2 polarization drives acute pancreatitis progression, regulated by ROS. A hollow manganese dioxide (HMnO2)&#8208;based nanoreactor (Pyp@APHM) targets inflammation via neutrophils, releases catalytic manganese porphyrin in situ, eliminates ROS, inhibits polarization, and offers a novel precise therapy for acute pancreatitis. More details can be found in article number 2502200 by Han Lin, Zhendong Jin, Wencheng Wu, Haojie Huang, and co&#8208;workers.

         <title>Advances in Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Coupled with Alcohol and Aldehyde Oxidation: Mechanistic Insights and Economic Feasibility</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, the synergistic integration of hydrogen evolution reactions with alcohol and aldehyde oxidation reactions is explored to enhance H2 production efficiency. It examines reaction mechanisms, catalytic pathways, and energy advantages over conventional water splitting. Additionally, it evaluates technoeconomic feasibility, highlighting industrial scalability and the potential for value&#8208;added chemical generation, supporting the transition to sustainable energy solutions.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic H2 generation via conventional water splitting is gaining attention, but challenges such as high overpotentials, energy demands, and slow kinetics limit its scalability. Here, a novel approach: coupling hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) with alcohol and aldehyde oxidation reactions (AAORs) is explored. This strategy decreases energy requirements, improves HER efficiency, and enables dual H2 generation. Additionally, it facilitates the cogeneration of valuable chemicals such as formate, acetate, and 2,5&#8208;furan dicarboxylic acid (FDCA), enhancing economic feasibility. A detailed analysis of alcohol and aldehyde oxidation mechanisms and their integration into electrocatalytic systems are provided here. Furthermore, it examines the technoeconomic advantages of HER coupled with AAORs, emphasizing cost efficiency and industrial scalability. It is aimed here to advance renewable energy technologies and optimize processes for large&#8208;scale H2 generation, contributing to a sustainable energy future by addressing these aspects.

         <title>Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Sulfur Batteries: From Challenges to Strategies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on building better aqueous zinc&#8208;sulfur batteries, including the electrochemistry of conventional and decoupled aqueous zinc&#8208;sulfur batteries, the challenges for the sulfur cathode, zinc anode, and corresponding electrolytes, and the available strategies for the batteries. It will provide guidelines for the modification of electrodes, along with the selection of zinc salts, additives, and co&#8208;solvents.








Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;S batteries (AZSBs), including conventional and decoupled AZSBs, are suitable options for advanced electrochemical energy storage systems. They are cost&#8208;effective with safety, high theoretical capacity, and power density. Nevertheless, many inherent hurdles need to be overcome to make AZSBs practically feasible, including irreversible transformation of the sulfur cathode, instability of the Zn anode, and incompatibility of the electrolyte. This review presents a comprehensive evaluation of AZSBs, emphasizing the configurations and electrode reactions, challenges, strategies, and prospects for the future. First, the electrochemistry behavior of AZSBs is reviewed, encompassing both conventional and decoupled battery configurations, along with their respective electrode reactions. Second, various sources, hosts, and additives for sulfur are identified that can effectively enhance the reversibility of the sulfur cathode. Third, approaches to constructing the solid electrolyte interphase on the Zn anode and facilitating Zn alloying are discussed as key strategies for anode protection. Fourth, the selection of zinc salts and the employment of organic co&#8208;solvents are explored to regulate electrolytes. Finally, the thoughts on future research development in AZSBs are presented to build better aqueous batteries.

Abstract
Electrochemical biosensors offer numerous advantages, including high sensitivity, specificity, portability, ease of use, rapid response times, versatility, and multiplexing capability. Advanced materials and nanomaterials enhance electrochemical biosensors by improving sensitivity, response, and portability. Machine learning (ML) integration with electrochemical biosensors is also gaining traction, being particularly promising for addressing challenges such as electrode fouling, interference from non&#8208;target analytes, variability in testing conditions, and inconsistencies across samples. ML enhances data processing and analysis efficiency, generating actionable results with minimal information loss. Additionally, ML is well&#8208;suited for handling large, noisy datasets often generated in continuous monitoring applications. Beyond data analysis, ML can also help optimize biosensor design and function. While extensive research has expanded applications of advanced and nanomaterials&#8208;enhanced electrochemical biosensors and ML in their respective fields, fewer studies explore their combined potential in diagnostics; their synergy holds immense promise for advancing diagnostics and screening. This review highlights recent ML applications in advanced and nanomaterial&#8208;enhanced electrochemical biosensing, categorized into biocatalytic sensing, affinity&#8208;based sensing, bioreceptor&#8208;free sensing, electrochemiluminescence, high&#8208;throughput sensing, and continuous monitoring. Together, these developments underscore the transformative potential of ML&#8208;aided advanced/nanomaterial&#8208;enhanced electrochemical biosensors in diagnostics and screening, paving new pathways in the field.

         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent progress in piezoelectric materials for regenerative medicine, emphasizing their ability to convert mechanical stimuli into bioelectric signals that promote tissue repair. Key discussions cover the intrinsic piezoelectric properties of biological tissues, co&#8208;stimulation cellular mechanisms for tissue regeneration, and optimized structural designs aligned with specific tissue demands for translational applications.








Abstract
Piezoelectric materials, capable of converting mechanical stimuli into electrical signals, have emerged as promising tools in regenerative medicine due to their potential to stimulate tissue repair. Despite a surge in research on piezoelectric biomaterials, systematic insights to direct their translational optimization remain limited. This review addresses the current landscape by bridging fundamental principles with clinical potential. The biomimetic basis of piezoelectricity, key molecular pathways involved in the synergy between mechanical and electrical stimulation for enhanced tissue regeneration, and critical considerations for material optimization, structural design, and biosafety is discussed. More importantly, the current status and translational quagmire of mechanisms and applications in recent years are explored. A mechanism&#8208;driven strategy is proposed for the therapeutic application of piezoelectric biomaterials for tissue repair and identify future directions for accelerated clinical applications.

         <title>Single&#8211;Atom Supported Catalysts and Beyond</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In contrast to traditional supports, single&#8211;atom catalyst supports possess abundant unsaturated coordination sites and diverse electronic states. They are used to accommodate active metal species, thereby modulating the strong metal&#8208;support interactions and influencing catalytic performance. The enhancement mechanisms due to site&#8208;specific strong metal&#8208;support interactions in single&#8211;atom supported catalysts can be categorized into two types: electronic interaction and synergistic catalysis.








Abstract
Tuning electronic configurations of active components in supported metal catalysts can be achieved via strong metal&#8211;support interaction (SMSI) between loaded metal species and support, which has a profound effect on catalytic efficiency. Distinct from conventional supports, single&#8211;atom catalysts, due to their rich unsaturated coordination metal sites and versatile electronic states, are employed as supports to load active metal species, which can manipulate the SMSI and thereby regulate catalytic performance. Although single&#8211;atom supported catalysts have demonstrated remarkable advance in catalytic capabilities, this field is still in its infancy with a large room for improvement. Here, definition, classification, and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art characterization techniques of single&#8211;atom supported catalysts are summarily demonstrated. The enhancement mechanisms influenced by site&#8208;specific strong metal&#8208;support interaction within single&#8211;atom supported catalysts including electronic interactions and synergistic catalysis are highlighted to present their potentials and advantages for catalysis community. Moreover, various single&#8211;atom supported catalysts with advanced components are summarized to discuss the relationships between components and catalytic properties. Finally, challenges and perspectives of single&#8211;atom supported catalysts for directions of future development are provided.

         <title>Electrochemical Cell Designs for Efficient Carbon Dioxide Reduction and Water Electrolysis: Status and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review discusses recent innovations in electrochemical CO2 reduction reactions (eCO2RR) and hydrogen evolution reaction cell designs. The latest advancements in in situ cells for operando characterization are also presented. Optimizations in flow patterns, membrane electrode assemblies, electrolyte engineering, and counter&#8208;anodic reactions provide valuable insights into upgrading catalytic systems with enhanced energy efficiency, aiming to support the industrial&#8208;scale implementation of eCO2RR and water electrolysis.








Abstract
Integrating renewable electricity and concentrated CO2 from direct air capture, electrochemical CO2 reduction reactions (eCO2RR) offer a promising pathway for converting CO2 into fuel chemicals, enabling the closure of the carbon loop in a sustainable manner. The clean H2 produced via the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) during water electrolysis can replace traditional fossil fuels without additional CO2 emissions. Achieving large&#8208;scale and high&#8208;efficiency eCO2RR and HER requires the development of rational electrolyzer designs, which are crucial for industrial implementation. This review examines recent innovations in system designs for eCO2RR, HER, and the latest advances in in situ cell designs for operando characterization during electrochemical reactions. It focuses on cell improvements in flow patterns, membrane electrode assemblies, and electrolyte engineering to maximize catalytic activities at the industrial level. Besides, the review discusses optimizing counter&#8208;anodic reactions to improve the energy efficiency of eCO2RR and water electrolysis, offering insights into the design of catalytic systems with efficient energy utilization. Furthermore, it explores the integration of eCO2RR and HER with other electrochemical systems (e.g., fuel cells), highlighting their potential role in the decarbonization of future industrial processes. Finally, the summary, challenge, and outlook on the industrial&#8208;scale eCO2RR and water electrolysis system designs are concluded.

         <title>Hydrogel&#8208;Mediated Preservation of Live Tumor Explants for Drug Development in Peritoneal Metastases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a hyaluronan&#8208;based hydrogel&#160;platform preserving the native tumor microenvironment (morphology, tissue composition, histology) of patient&#8208;derived explants from peritoneal metastases, enabling clinically relevant drug screening. Hydrogel properties such as stiffness and degradation are crucial for longer&#8208;term histoculture. This study also reveals for the first time, a universal finding that hydrogels perturb myosin II&#8208;mediated tissue contraction in embedded tissues, thereby enhancing explant preservation.








Abstract
Clinically effective treatments for peritoneal metastases (PM) remain a significant unmet need. To expedite drug development in PM, hyaluronan (HA) hydrogel&#8208;supported PM patient&#8208;derived tumor explants (PDTE) that better preserve histological features, composition, and biological pathways of the original tumor, as compared to conventional PDTE culture methods are developed. Hydrogel modulation shows that stiffness, degradation, three&#8208;dimensional embedding, and HA itself are key parameters that enhance PDTE maintenance ex vivo. Further, HA hydrogels effectively preserve PDTE viability by disrupting myosin II&#8208;mediated tissue contraction, a phenomenon that occurs in the absence of hydrogel embedding. Lastly, the addition of ascites into PM PDTE not only recapitulates changes to the tumor microenvironment as observed in patients but also ascites&#8208;dependent drug efficacy, highlighting the importance of incorporating ascites into ex vivo PM models for accurate therapeutic evaluation. The bioengineered PM PDTE models in this study serve as a valuable platform for drug development and treatment personalization.

         <title>Self&#8208;Replenishable Metabolically Augmented Synbiotic Microspheres Remodel Gut&#8208;Bone Homeostasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a self&#8208;replenishable metabolically augmented synbiotic microsphere (SMASM) is fabricated via thiol&#8211;ene click reaction to restore gut&#8208;bone homeostasis, by employing Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG as a viable metabolic niche and hyaluronic acid as a self&#8208;replenishable prebiotic substrate. Oral administration of SMASMs improves intestinal barrier integrity, mitigates inflammation, and suppresses bone loss in ovariectomized mice, accompanied by alterations in microbial biomarkers and predicted metabolic functions.








Abstract
Gut microbiota dysbiosis in postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO) is frequently accompanied by aberrant metabolism and absorption of short&#8208;chain fatty acids (SCFAs). However, current oral probiotic therapies neglect the crucial role of probiotic&#8208;driven SCFAs metabolism in restoring gut&#8208;bone homeostasis. In this study, commencing with the sequencing of fecal samples from clinical patients with PMO, a self&#8208;replenishable metabolically augmented synbiotic microsphere (SMASM) is fabricated via a thiol&#8211;ene click reaction to restore gut&#8208;bone homeostasis using Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) as a viable metabolic niche and hyaluronic acid (HA) as a self&#8208;replenishable prebiotic substrate. In vitro, the SMASMs exhibit favorable biocompatibility, enhanced resistance to gastric acid, and improved mucosal adhesion for colonization. In vivo, oral administration of SMASMs in ovariectomized mice improves intestinal barrier integrity, mitigates inflammation, and suppresses bone loss, accompanied by alterations in microbial biomarkers and predicted metabolic functions. Notably, HA serves as a sustainable prebiotic substrate that supports the LGG metabolic niche and microbial homeostasis, enhances the production of SCFAs, including butyric, isobutyric, and valeric acids, and contributes to the downregulation of key osteoclastic signaling factors. Importantly, this strategy of oral SMASMs through in situ fermentation offers novel insights into addressing metabolic disorders associated with gut microbiota via the gut&#8211;X axis.

         <title>Controlling Lithium Surface Diffusivity via 2D PtTe2, PdTe2, and NiTe2 Coatings for Anode&#8208;Free and Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lithium plating mechanisms on 2D&#8208;coated current collectors: PtTe2 coating enables rapid Li surface diffusivity, while PdTe2 and NiTe2 coatings shorten diffusion paths for Li adatoms. In addition, Li2Te, formed from PdTe2 and NiTe2 decomposition, reduces the critical nucleus size by lowering the interfacial energy between the electrolyte and deposited Li.








Abstract
Anode&#8208;free Li&#8208;ion batteries (AFLBs) and Li&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) offer superior energy densities compared to conventional Li&#8208;ion batteries with graphite anodes. However, they degrade faster owing to their lower Coulombic efficiency, primarily caused by uneven Li deposition on the current collector (CC) in AFLBs or the Li&#8208;metal anode (LMA) in LMBs. Coating CCs and LMAs has emerged as a promising strategy to enhance the CE. Coating CCs and LMAs with PtTe2, PdTe2, and NiTe2&#8212;metallic 2D transition metal dichalcogenides&#8212;reveals the critical factors for achieving uniform Li plating. The PtTe2 coating facilitates rapid Li surface diffusivity, while the PdTe2 and NiTe2 coatings provide shorter diffusion paths for Li adatoms on the CCs and LMAs. In addition, Li2Te, formed as a byproduct of the decomposition of PdTe2 and NiTe2 during Li plating, reduces the critical nucleus size by minimizing the interfacial energy between the electrolyte and the plated Li. PtTe2 more effectively enhances the AFLB cycling performance, whereas PdTe2 and NiTe2 are more advantageous for LMBs. Notably, a 5&#8208;nm&#8208;thick PdTe2 coating on the LMA achieves 80% capacity retention after 450 cycles using a LiFePO4 cathode (3 mAh cm&#8722;2) at a 0.5 C&#8208;rate.

         <title>Siliconizing&#8208;Driven Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Growth of 2D Tellurides with Controlled Crystallization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents the strategy for preparing large&#8208;area 2D zirconium tellurides through a siliconizing&#8208;driven layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer growth process. The use of Si&#8208;Te precursor in this strategy, instead of conventional Te source, enhances the growth controllability of 2D ZrTe2 and ZrTe3 single crystals such as layer thickness and crystallinity. The findings facilitate wafer&#8208;scale 2D tellurides for spintronic applications.








Abstract
2D transition metal tellurides (TMTs) possess fascinating properties for applications in ferroelectrics and optoelectronics. Nevertheless, it is still challenging to grow high&#8208;quality 2D TMTs with the desired phase (especially high&#8208;temperature phase) because of the weak bonding between the transition metal and Te as compared to S and Se atoms. Here, a strategy of siliconizing&#8208;driven layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer growth is reported to synthesize 2D ZrTe2 and ZrTe3 crystals with high crystallinity and desired thickness. Both as&#8208;synthesized crystals exhibit large&#8208;area uniform phases and atomically precise layered stacking structures. 2D ZrTe2 shows type&#8208;II Weyl semimetal characteristics with negative magnetoresistance, and 2D ZrTe3 demonstrates the existence of charge density waves and intrinsic superconductivity. Theoretical study reveals that silicon atoms can infiltrate and isolate a single layer of zirconium atoms and allow them to be tellurized in a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer manner. The work paves the way for the synthesis of layer&#8208;controlled 2D TMTs and lays a material foundation for their physical property research.

         <title>Generalized Adaptive Cation&#8208;Selective Interfaces Exhibiting High Stability: Integrating Transduction Materials and Uniform Ion&#8208;Selective Membranes via One&#8208;Step Fabrication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An adaptive integrated interface structure coupling time&#8208;dependent solvent evaporation and spatial sedimentation of transduction material is customized using lipophilic molybdenum disulfide as ion&#8208;selective membrane (ISM) components, featuring a uniform ISM on top and transduction layers below. The interfacial mixed capacitance stability mechanism, driven by TFPB&#8722; surface adsorption, enhances the stability of general cation&#8208;selective electrodes and offers insights for sensing chip development.








Abstract
Rapidly advancing all&#8208;solid&#8208;state ion&#8208;selective electrodes are promising candidates as key components in intelligent biological and chemical sensors. Ionics sensing performance, essential for sensor stability and reliability, is influenced not only by interface compositions but by often&#8208;overlooked overall interface structures. This work develops a one&#8208;step adaptive integrated interface structure (AIIS) with high interfacial stability for analyzing general cations (K+, Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Pb2+, Cd2+, and Cu2+), showcasing exceptional near&#8208;Nernst response across wide linear ranges. AIIS, based on cetyltrimethylammonium&#8208;regulated lipophilic molybdenum disulfide (2.0 CTA&#8208;MoS2), forms single&#8208;piece ISM on top and bottom transduction layers over time due to THF volatilization in ISM solutions, ensuring performance adaptability. A kinetic model developed through electrochemical numerical simulation confirms the optimal theoretical stability of an AIIS based on maximum transduction layer charge current and minimal diffusion current. The mixed capacitive transduction mechanism driven by the adsorption of TFPB&#8722; on the 2.0 CTA&#8208;MoS2 surface is elucidated. Adaptive integrated cadmium ion&#8208;selective electrodes, as a case study, exhibit excellent interfacial stability (potential drift of 5.51 &#177; 0.32 &#181;V&#160;h&#8722;1 for 24&#160;h and sensitivity loss rate of 4.77% for 30 days) and selectivity. This study proposes a promising strategy for constructing extendable interface structures, providing valuable insights for advancing sensor chip development.

         <title>De Novo Design of Efficient NIR&#8208;II&#8208;Activated Heavy&#8208;Atom&#8208;Free Type&#8208;I Photosensitizer for Anti&#8208;Tumor Photoimmunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free NIR&#8208;I&amp;II activated photosensitizers (PSs) based on boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) derivatives are synthesized via a de novo design strategy. Upon 1064&#160;nm laser irradiation, CTU3 NPs show highly efficient 7.8&#8208;fold enhancement in type&#8208;I reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation that is higher than the reported type&#8208;I PS, resulting in irreversible cytotoxicity to tumor tissue and distinct solid tumor ablation and triggered immunogenic cell death (ICD) within tumors.








Abstract
Type&#8208;I photosensitizers (PSs) are considered to be efficient agents for overcoming the oxygen&#8208;dependent deficiency of traditional photodynamic therapy (PDT). However, it is still challenging to design type&#8208;I PSs that can be activated by the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) irradiation. Herein, a series of organic heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free molecules are designed (named as CTU1, CTU2, and CTU3) and exhibit strong absorption bands over the first near&#8208;infrared and NIR&#8208;II regions. Among them, water&#8208;dispersible CTU3 nanoparticles (NPs) show strong J&#8208;aggregate characteristics and a good NIR&#8208;II absorption band, resulting in highly efficient &#8226;O2&#8722; generation upon irradiation of 1064&#160;nm light. In addition, the CTU3 NPs also exhibit a high photothermal conversion efficiency of 88.6%. In vitro and in vivo experiments show that CTU3 NPs have superior PDT and photothermal therapy (PTT) effects, which can further induce immunogenic cell death and activate immune cells in 4T1 tumor&#8208;bearing mice for combined PDT/PTT anti&#8208;tumor photoimmunotherapy against refractory tumors. This work presents a paradigm of de novo design of NIR&#8208;II light&#8208;activated type&#8208;I PS for combinational photoimmunotherapy of cancer.

         <title>2D, Physical&#8208;Vapor Growth of Low&#8208;Coercivity, Epitaxial Ferroelectric Sc0.3Al0.7N on Scalable Substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically smooth, ultrathin Sc0.3Al0.7N ferroelectric films are synthesized on scalable substrates via 2D pulsed laser deposition. The films exhibit significantly reduced coercive fields, exceptional crystallinity, and robust endurance. Density functional theory and cross&#8208;sectional microscopy reveal the role of abrupt interfaces in minimizing switching barriers, offering new insights into energy&#8208;efficient ferroelectric device platforms.








Abstract
Ferroelectric nitrides attract immense attention due to their excellent electrical, mechanical, and thermal properties as well as for their compatibility with scalable semiconductor technology. The availability of high&#8208;quality nitride films possessing tailorable coercive voltage and field, however, remains challenging, and is a key for deeper exploration of switching dynamics and practical applications in low&#8208;power devices. 2D growth of epitaxial thin (&#8818;20&#160;nm) c&#8208;axis&#8208;oriented Sc0.3Al0.7N films is reported on Al2O3 (0001) and on electrically conductive 4H&#8208;SiC (0001), obtained by reflection high&#8208;energy electron diffraction&#8208;monitored layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer physical vapor deposition growth. Films exhibit high quality, as evidenced by rocking curve full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) as narrow as &#8776;0.02&#176;, and an atomically abrupt film&#8208;substrate interface with low dislocation density. The coercive field of Sc0.3Al0.7N/4H&#8208;SiC (0001) heterostructures is as low as 2.75 MV&#160;cm&#8722;1. Moreover, a high endurance of &gt;109 cycles at saturation polarization is achieved. Density functional theory calculations of a model system reveal that an improved crystal quality, including atomically abrupt ferroelectric nitride&#8208;metal interface, facilitates the reduction in the switching barriers, and leads to reduced coercivity. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of obtaining high&#8208;quality epitaxial ferroelectric nitride films on highly scalable and radiation&#8208;resistant substrates, and their potential for energy&#8208;efficient electronic devices.

         <title>Biocatalytic and Redox&#8208;Regulated Nanoarchitectures for Precision Inflammation and Immune Homeostasis Modulation to Combat Rheumatoid Arthritis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biocatalytic and redox&#8208;regulated nanoarchitectures (BEVs@Ru&#8208;HFO) have been constructed for precision inflammation and immune homeostasis modulation to combat rheumatoid arthritis. Benefiting from the synergistic effects of exceptional antioxidase&#8208;like catalytic activities, extracellular vesicles&#8208;mediated inflammation targeting, and ultrasound&#8208;assisted cellular uptake, the BEVs@Ru&#8208;HFO effectively reprograms macrophages, downregulates inflammatory cytokines, and ameliorates hypoxia to inhibit osteoclastogenesis, and ultimately confers bone/cartilage protection and restores joint function.








Abstract
The chronic inflammatory milieu of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), marked by elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS), perpetually activated pro&#8208;inflammatory macrophages (M1) and osteoclasts, and significant infiltration of pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines contributes to abnormal articular redox imbalance, severe synovitis, and progressive joint erosion. In this study, the rational design of a biocatalytic and redox&#8208;regulated nanoarchitecture comprising Ru cluster&#8208;anchored hydroxylated Fe2O3 (Ru&#8208;HFO) encapsulated within bone marrow stem cell&#8208;derived extracellular vesicles (BEVs), for precision inflammation modulation to combat RA is proposed. When combined with ultrasound (US) stimulation, this biocatalytic and inflammation&#8208;targeting nanoarchitecture (BEVs@Ru&#8208;HFO) can reprogram macrophages and osteoclasts to restore redox and immune homeostasis, thereby alleviating RA. The findings reveal that the hydroxylation strategy enhances electron density at Ru redox centers and fine&#8208;tunes the binding affinity of oxygen intermediates, thereby ensuring exceptional multi&#8208;enzymatic ROS&#8208;scavenging activities. Notably, under ultrasonic irradiation, BEVs@Ru&#8208;HFO targets inflamed joints, promotes the local accumulation of anti&#8208;inflammatory macrophages, downregulates inflammatory cytokines, and ameliorates the hypoxic microenvironment to inhibit osteoclastogenesis. This ultimately confers bone and cartilage protection and restores joint function. It is posit that this biocatalytic and redox&#8208;regulated nanoarchitecture, with its superior antioxidant and immunomodulatory capabilities, represents a promising strategy for engineering ROS&#8208;catalytic materials to treat RA and potentially many other autoimmune diseases.

         <title>A Single&#8208;Cell Atlas&#8208;Inspired Hitchhiking Therapeutic Strategy for Acute Pancreatitis by Restricting ROS in Neutrophils</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study discloses the first comprehensive single&#8208;cell differentiation atlas of neutrophils during acute pancreatitis. A neutrophil&#8208;targeted nanoreactor is developed to regulate neutrophil polarization by restricting intracellular reactive oxygen species levels. This strategy effectively alleviates inflammation, offering new mechanistic insights and potential therapeutic avenues for the treatment of acute pancreatitis.








Abstract
Neutrophils can undergo transcriptional and epigenetic reprogramming in disease, thus causing inflammation or modulating tissue repair and fibrosis. A thorough understanding of the neutrophil subpopulation composition and their polarization processes in acute pancreatitis (AP) is essential to open up design of treatments tailored to individual patients. Herein, this study distinct subgroups and two differentiation pathways associated with N1 and N2 polarization during AP by single&#8208;cell sequencing. Inspired by this, a hollow manganese dioxide (HMnO2)&#8208;based nanoreactor (Pyp@APHM) conjugated with neutrophil&#8208;binding Ly&#8208;6G antibody and loaded with porphyrin is developed for targeted and in situ modulation of neutrophil polarization. Pyp@APHM can enrich the AP site by hitchhiking on neutrophils and then degrade in response to a weakly acidic environment to simultaneously release manganese ions and porphyrin ligands, enabling in situ synthesis of manganese porphyrin antioxidants. Leveraging this strategy, Pyp@APHM can effectively eliminate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and broadly inhibit both N1 and N2 polarization, as well as enhance tissue oxygenation by generating O2, thereby further mitigating pancreatic inflammation. This study provides a comprehensive single&#8208;cell atlas of neutrophils in AP and proposes an innovative hitchhiking therapeutic strategy for AP by restricting ROS in neutrophils.

Inspired by this, a hollow manganese dioxide (HMnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)-based nanoreactor (Pyp@APHM) conjugated with neutrophil-binding Ly-6G antibody and loaded with porphyrin is developed for targeted and in situ modulation of neutrophil polarization. Pyp@APHM can enrich the AP site by hitchhiking on neutrophils and then degrade in response to a weakly acidic environment to simultaneously release manganese ions and porphyrin ligands, enabling in situ synthesis of manganese porphyrin antioxidants. Leveraging this strategy, Pyp@APHM can effectively eliminate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and broadly inhibit both N1 and N2 polarization, as well as enhance tissue oxygenation by generating O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, thereby further mitigating pancreatic inflammation. This study provides a comprehensive single-cell atlas of neutrophils in AP and proposes an innovative hitchhiking therapeutic strategy for AP by restricting ROS in neutrophils.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Probing the Effect of Electrode Thermodynamics on Reaction Heterogeneity in Thick Battery Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thick electrodes promise higher battery energy density but suffer from reaction heterogeneity. While typically attributed to sluggish charge transport, this study shows how thermodynamic properties of active materials also have critical influence. Through advanced X&#8208;ray characterization of LiFePO4 and LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 thick electrodes, stark differences in their reaction gradients are revealed and a predictive metric to guide electrode design is introduced.








Abstract
Thick electrodes present a viable strategy for enhancing energy density and reducing manufacturing costs of lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, reaction heterogeneity during cycling compromises their rate capability and cycle life. While this nonuniformity is commonly attributed to sluggish charge transport, it is demonstrated here that the thermodynamic properties of the electrode material play an equally critical role. Through combined X&#8208;ray fluorescence microscopy and absorption near&#8208;edge structure spectroscopy, reaction distributions in LiFePO4 (LFP) and LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 (NMC) thick electrodes with matched porosity and tortuosity are compared. LFP electrodes develop pronounced depth&#8208;oriented state&#8208;of&#8208;charge (SOC) gradients that worsen with increasing discharge rates, whereas NMC maintains much more uniform SOC distributions under such conditions. This difference originates from their distinct SOC dependence of equilibrium potentials and is quantifiable through a dimensionless &#8220;reaction uniformity&#8221; number. Intriguingly, LFP thick electrodes also exhibit lateral SOC variations that strengthen during slow discharge. The enhanced reaction uniformity in NMC correlates with better active material utilization and slower capacity fade than LFP, highlighting electrode thermodynamics as a key design consideration for thick electrodes.

         <title>Direct Observation of Optically Active Mid&#8208;Gap Electronic States in Hexagonal Boron Nitride by Electron Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present work utilizes STEM&#8208;EELS for a direct visualization of defect mediated midgap electronic states (MESs) in hexagonal boron nitride and correlates these states with observed photoluminescence.








Abstract
Optically active point defects in wide&#8208;bandgap semiconductors have been demonstrated to be attractive for a variety of quantum and nanoscale applications. In particular, color centers in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have recently gained substantial attention owing to their spectral tunability, brightness, stability, and room&#8208;temperature operation. Despite all of the recent studies, precise detection of the defect&#8208;induced mid&#8208;gap electronic states (MESs) and their simultaneous correlations with the observed emission in hBN remain elusive. Directly probing these MESs provides a powerful approach toward atomic identification and optical control of the defect centers underlying the sub&#8208;bandgap emission in hBN. Combining optical and electron spectroscopy, the existence of mid&#8208;gap absorptive features is revealed at the emissive sites in hBN, along with an atom&#8208;by&#8208;atom identification of the underlying defect configuration. The atomically resolved defect structure, primarily constituted by vacancies and carbon/oxygen substitutions, is further studied via first&#8208;principles calculations, which support the correlation with the observed MESs through the electronic density of states. This work provides a direct relationship between the observed visible emission in hBN, the underlying defect structure, and its absorptive MESs, opening venues for atomic&#8208;scale and optical control in hBN for quantum&#160;technology.

         <title>Cu2O/CuVO3 Nano&#8208;Heterojunction as a Highly Active Therapeutic Catalyst for Aggravating Redox Dyshomeostasis of Neoplastic Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A belt&#8208;like heterojunction nanozyme (CVO) with high peroxidase&#8208;like activity is facilely developed for inducing apoptosis, ferroptosis, and cuproptosis via redox imbalance in tumors. DFT analysis attributes its catalytic efficiency to charge transfer and OH coverage. This study offers useful insights into nanozyme structure&#8208;activity relationships and advances tumor&#8208;targeted catalytic therapy.








Abstract
Redox dyshomeostasis is both a hallmark and a vulnerability of cancer cells, offering multiple avenues for therapeutic intervention. Herein, a belt&#8208;like nano&#8208;heterojunction Cu2O/CuVO3 (CVO) is developed as a potential redox dyshomeostasis inducer by exacerbating ROS levels and compromising antioxidant defense without the need of exogenous stimulations. Steady&#8208;state analysis reveals that CVO exhibits extraordinary reaction velocity and catalytic efficiency (Vmax = 2.32 &#181;m s&#8722;1, Kcat = 0.49 s&#8722;1) in the production of hydroxyl radicals (&#183;OH). Likewise, density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the superb charge&#8208;transferring properties in the heterojunction structure and unique surface coverage rate of CVO primarily dominate the high&#8208;efficient catalytic reactions. Noteworthy, CVO is capable of inducing mitochondria dysfunction by aggravating the cellular redox imbalance, thereby triggering multiple cell death pathways and generating synergistic effects. Transcriptomics analysis outcomes further demonstrate that CVO exerts significant and distinct effects on key biological processes in tumor cells, encompassing but not limited to canonical pathways such as apoptosis, ferroptosis, and cuprotosis. Both in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate the pronounced tumor&#8208;inhibitory efficacy of CVO, which paves a promising pathway for the development of novel nanocatalysts that effectively target cancer through the amplification of redox dyshomeostasis.

         <title>Dynamic Magnonic Crystals Based on Spatiotemporal Plasmon Excitation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid magnonic&#8208;plasmonic metamaterials enabling spatiotemporal optical control of spin&#8208;wave transport are demonstrated. These structures integrate periodic stripes of gold nanodisk arrays with low&#8208;damping yttrium iron garnet films to realize dynamically reconfigurable magnonic crystals. By utilizing localized thermoplasmonic heating, induced by short laser pulses, the system achieves active modulation of the magnonic band structure, including the formation of bandgaps and minibands.








Abstract
Metamaterials, designed to exhibit properties beyond those found in nature, enable unprecedented control over physical phenomena through flexible band structure engineering. This work introduces a hybrid magnonic&#8208;plasmonic metamaterial that allows spatiotemporal manipulation of spin&#8208;wave transport at micrometer scales and sub&#8208;microsecond timescales. The system integrates a plasmonic metamaterial, comprising Au nanodisk arrays arranged in a 1D periodic stripe pattern, with a low&#8208;damping yttrium iron garnet (YIG) film as the spin&#8208;wave transport medium. Short laser pulses (100&#8722;500 ns) excite surface lattice resonances (SLRs) in the plasmonic stripes, inducing thermoplasmonic heating and generating a striped temperature profile. This dynamic thermal modulation periodically alters the YIG film's saturation magnetization, forming a laser&#8208;controlled magnonic crystal. Time&#8208;resolved propagating spin&#8208;wave spectroscopy reveals tunable bandgaps and minibands arising from Bragg reflection. By adjusting the plasmonic stripe pattern, laser pulse duration, or power, this system enables precise control over spin&#8208;wave transport, paving the way for reconfigurable wave&#8208;based computing&#160;devices.

         <title>Quantifying the Effects of Geometric Parameters on the Elastic Properties of Multilayer Graphene Platelet Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Realistic random 3D periodic representative volume element models of multilayer graphene platelet films are constructed to perform simulations, quantify the effects of different geometric parameters on all their five independent elastic properties, and uncover the dominant deformation mechanisms. The obtained dimensionless results apply to different types of laminate or multi&#8208;layered materials such as MXene, graphene oxide films, and nacre and seashells.








Abstract
Multilayer graphene platelet films (MGPFs) are widely studied for their exceptional mechanical, electrical, and chemical properties. The elastic properties and deformation mechanisms of MGPFs are highly sensitive to their geometric parameters, including graphene platelet size, graphene area fraction, and layer count. Despite extensive experimental and theoretical efforts, systematically quantifying these effects remains a significant challenge, severely hindering the design of high&#8208;performance MGPFs. Here, realistic random 3D periodic representative volume element (RVE) models of MGPFs are constructed to perform simulations, quantify the effects of different geometric parameters on all their five independent elastic properties, and uncover the dominant deformation mechanisms. The results reveal that the dimensionless platelet size, graphene area fraction, and number of platelet layers significantly affect the elastic properties, with detailed quantifications provided for their relationships. The effects of defects on the elastic properties are also explored, offering insights into the dominant deformation mechanisms. Validation against experimental data confirms that the developed RVE models and dimensionless results apply to various multilayer laminate composites, including MGPFs, MXene, graphene oxide films, and nacre&#8208;like materials. The findings provide a robust framework and pave the way for optimizing the design of MGPFs and other laminate composites, enabling their potential in diverse applications.

         <dc:description>
This work reports a compact, high&#8208;performance, solution&#8208;processed flexible organic spectrometer featuring an optical cascade architecture that integrates organic electrochromic devices and photodetectors. This organic spectrometer reliably reconstructs monochromatic, narrowband, and broadband spectra reconstruction with high resolution, accuracy, and the capability for absolute spectral irradiance measurement.








Abstract
Spectrometers are indispensable tools for civil and military&#8208;related optoelectronic applications. To meet the requirements of the revolutionary data/AI&#8208;driven era, next&#8208;generation spectrometers must not only be flexible with minimal sizes but exhibit high accuracy and resolution. In this study, a compact, high&#8208;performance, and flexible organic spectrometer is reported, fabricated using solution processing, which employs an optical cascade architecture by integrating organic electrochromic devices and photodetectors. This organic spectrometer can not only achieve a resolution of 0.56&#160;nm, an accuracy of 0.14&#160;nm, and a broad detection range from 400 to 1000&#160;nm but also realize a vital absolute spectral irradiance measurement ranging from 10&#8722;8 to 10&#8722;4&#160;W cm&#8722;2 nm&#8722;1. Additionally, its intrinsic flexibility and highly replaceable feasibility of bandgap&#8208;tunable organic materials enable their high applicability with excellent portability and adaptability in the upcoming data/AI&#8208;driven era or scenarios.

         <title>Vectorial Fluorescence Control with Light&#8208;Emitting Metasurfaces for Unidirectional Emission and Incoherent Holography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The light&#8208;emitting metasurfaces (LEMs) are constructed for unidirectional emission and incoherent photoluminescence (PL) holography. Through engineering the interaction between LEM and guided PL, the diffraction angle, linear polarization state, and emission intensity are independently controlled. Furthermore, the phase encoding capability of LEM experimentally enabled vectorial PL holography alongside nanoprinting. Such LEM potentially paves the way for next&#8208;generation vectorial light&#8208;emitting devices.








Abstract
Ultracompact light emission manipulation is crucial for various applications, including illumination, biosensing, and quantum photonics. Despite significant advancements in lasing manipulation, achieving complex vectorial wavefront control over fluorescence emission is inherently challenging due to its incoherent, omnidirectional, unpolarized, and phase&#8208;random emission characteristics. Here, the light&#8208;emitting metasurfaces (LEMs), equipped with vectorial manipulation and complex amplitude encoding capabilities, are introduced to realize unidirectional emission and incoherent photoluminescence (PL) holography. Through engineering the interaction between the LEM and guided PL, the diffraction angle, linear polarization state, and emission intensity of PL unidirectional emission are independently controlled. Furthermore, the phase encoding capability of LEM, combined with the enhanced spatial coherence of guided PL, experimentally enabled vectorial PL holography alongside polarization&#8208;multiplexed nanoprinting. This versatile LEM platform provides a simplified approach to vectorial PL manipulation, promising multiple potential applications in nanophotonics and light&#8208;emitting devices.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Charging Single&#8208;Atom Nanozymes Activated Pyroptosis for Antitumor Immunotherapy via Bioorthogonal Disruption of Succination and Reinvigorating T Lymphocytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In order to enhance tumor immunogenicity, reshape the immune microenvironment, and consume immunosuppressive metabolites, an ultrasound&#8208;driven piezoelectric charges assisted Fe&#8208;based single&#8208;atom nanozyme with co&#8208;loaded triphenylphosphonium and methyl (Z)&#8208;4&#8208;(chloro(2&#8208;phenylhydrazono)methyl)benzoate that can serve as a pyroptosis initiator and metabolism immune activator significantly enhance antitumor immunotherapy effects via ROS storms, fumarate depletion, triggering pyroptosis and reinvigorating T lymphocytes, is constructed.








Abstract
Pyroptosis can trigger strong immunogenic cell death (ICD) of tumor cells for antitumor immunotherapy. However, metabolic disorders of fumarate in the tumor microenvironment (TME) can significantly reduce the pyroptosis rate and render T lymphocytes dysfunctional. Here, the ultrasound (US)&#8208;driven piezoelectric charges assisted Fe&#8208;based SAzyme (BFTM) with co&#8208;loaded triphenylphosphonium (TPP) and methyl (Z)&#8208;4&#8208;(chloro(2&#8208;phenylhydrazono)methyl)benzoate (MMB, a bioorthogonal reagent of fumarate) for activating pyroptosis and regulating fumarate metabolism is developed. Positive and negative charges generated by barium titanate (BTO) regulate the electron cloud density of single&#8208;Fe atom, endowing the BFTM with efficient reactive oxygen species (ROS) production ability for triggering caspase&#8208;1 related gasdermin D (GSDMD) mediated pyroptosis. Meanwhile, the consumption of intracellular fumarate through bioorthogonal reaction not only prevented the succinate of cysteines in GSDMD, causing it to be activated and oligomerized by caspase&#8208;1 to enhance pyroptosis but also restored the phosphorylation of ZAP70 to normalize the T cell receptor (TCR) signaling pathways for reinvigorating CD8+ T cells. In short, US&#8208;driven BFTM as a pyroptosis initiator and metabolism immune activator significantly enhances antitumor immunotherapy effects via ROS storms, fumarate depletion, triggering pyroptosis, and reinvigorating T lymphocytes.

         <title>Infrared Photothermal Catalytic Reduction of Atmospheric CO2 Into CO with 100% Selectivity via Dual&#8208;Plasmon Resonance Conductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Schematic illustration of the designed environmentally friendly CO synthesis route from infrared&#8208;light&#8208;driven reduction of atmospheric CO2 over a dual&#8208;plasmonic photocatalyst, in which the dual&#8208;plasmonic effect helps to improve infrared region absorption and promotes carrier space separation, but also reduces CO2 reaction energy barrier.








Abstract
Today, the fabrication of carbon monoxide (CO) in industry customarily necessitates elevated temperature and pressure. Concurrently, the harnessing of infrared (IR) light, which constitutes &#8776;50% of solar energy, has predominantly remained unexploited due to a pronounced contradiction between the utilization of IR light and CO2 photoreduction. To break the above limitation, a dual&#8208;plasmon resonance conductor with a metallic nature is designed, which realizes the synthesis of CO with 100% selectivity from infrared photothermal catalytic reduction of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). Taking the Au particles loaded Cu7Te4 nanowires as an example, the surface dual&#8208;plasmon resonance coupling effect can optimize the three critical processes of CO2 photoreduction, in which it is illustrated that the dual&#8208;plasmon resonance effect lowers the thermodynamic reaction energy barrier, facilitating the selective generation of CO products. Consequently, the Au&#8208;Cu7Te4 nanowires manifest a CO evolution rate of &#8776;2.7&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with 100% selectivity for atmospheric CO2 reduction driven by IR light, several times higher than that of the Cu7Te4 nanowires.

Concurrently, the harnessing of infrared (IR) light, which constitutes &#8776;50% of solar energy, has predominantly remained unexploited due to a pronounced contradiction between the utilization of IR light and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photoreduction. To break the above limitation, a dual-plasmon resonance conductor with a metallic nature is designed, which realizes the synthesis of CO with 100% selectivity from infrared photothermal catalytic reduction of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Taking the Au particles loaded Cu&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nanowires as an example, the surface dual-plasmon resonance coupling effect can optimize the three critical processes of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photoreduction, in which it is illustrated that the dual-plasmon resonance effect lowers the thermodynamic reaction energy barrier, facilitating the selective generation of CO products. Consequently, the Au-Cu&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nanowires manifest a CO evolution rate of &#8776;2.7&#160;&#181;mol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with 100% selectivity for atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction driven by IR light, several times higher than that of the Cu&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nanowires.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Artificial T Cells (ATC) for Tumor Colonization: Combining T cell&#8208;derived granzyme B and phage&#8208;derived holin within a disulfide&#8208;linked chitosan&#8208;hyaluronic acid hydrogel framework. ATC targets and destroys tumor cells and intracellular bacteria, enhances immune cell infiltration, and inhibits tumor migration, showcasing potential in precision medicine for effective anti&#8208;tumor immunity.








Abstract
Tumor&#8208;colonizing bacteria can impede the efficacy of cancer treatments and elevate the risk of metastatic spread. While cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are essential for destroying tumor cells, they lack the ability to eliminate bacteria. Here, the artificial T cells (ATC) are presented for tumors, particularly those colonized with intracellular bacteria. The ATC is composed of a hydrogel framework made of disulfide&#8208;linked chitosan and hyaluronic acid, encapsulating T cell&#8208;derived granzyme B and phage&#8208;derived holin. This design leverages the tumor microenvironment for the targeted release of these antitumor and antibacterial agents to precisely kill tumor cells and intracellular bacteria. In vivo studies demonstrate the debris from ATC&#8208;mediated destruction acts as an immune stimulator, promoting immune cell infiltration and inhibiting tumor migration. This work highlights the potential of ATC therapy in achieving targeted treatment and robust anti&#8208;tumor immunity, advancing the field of artificial cell technologies for precision medicine.

         <title>Designing Moderately&#8208;Solvating Electrolytes for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design principle of moderately solvating electrolytes (MSEs) for lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs) is demonstrated by using a multiple&#8208;solvent system comprising of a highly&#8208;solvating solvent, a weakly&#8208;solvating solvent, and a non&#8208;solvating solvent. The optimal MSE significantly improves the cycle life of LSBs by doubling that of similar cells with the conventional electrolyte and enables stable calendar life for at least seven months.








Abstract
New electrolytes are critical for high&#8208;energy lithium (Li)&#8211;sulfur (S) batteries (LSBs) to ensure their stability against Li metal anode and polysulfides (PSs) shuttling which hinder the large&#8208;scale application of LSBs. In this study, the design principle of moderately solvating electrolytes (MSEs) for LSBs is demonstrated by using a multiple&#8208;solvent system comprising of a highly solvating solvent, a weakly solvating solvent, and a non&#8208;solvating solvent to create a well&#8208;balanced electrolyte system. This resulting electrolyte significantly improves the cycle life of LSBs, achieving 300 cycles, which is twice as long as that of similar cells with the conventional electrolyte and it also ensures stable calendar life for at least seven months. The optimal MSE forms robust passivation layers enhancing the structural integrity of both S and Li metal electrodes after cycling. These virtues effectively hinder parasitic side reactions and self&#8208;discharge behavior of LSBs. This electrolyte design principle is versatile and can be applied to other battery chemistries, providing a potential path toward the development of a more efficient and stable battery system. By addressing key challenges such as the instability of electrodes and shuttling of polysulfides, this electrolyte approach offers promising solutions for advancing LSB technology.

         <title>Highly Efficient and Stable Green Quantum Rod LEDs Enabled by Material and Charge Injection Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>

Green&#8208;emitting CdSe/ZnxCd1&#8208;xS quantum rods with gradient shell, uniform shape, and shortened ligands enable high PLQY and efficient charge injection. Combined with a double hole transport layer structure to suppress electron leakage and enhance hole injection, the resulting QRLEDs achieve 24% EQE, &gt;500&#8201;000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 brightness, and &gt;22&#8201;000 h T&#8325;&#8320; lifetime, advancing high&#8208;performance display applications.








Abstract
Nanocrystal&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) are a promising technology for the next generation of flexible and large&#8208;area displays, offering high brightness, tunable narrow emission, and high display contrast. Although internal quantum efficiency (IQE) has reached unity, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of LEDs utilizing spherical quantum dots (QDs) is limited by low light outcoupling efficiency (&#951;out). A promising approach to improve &#951;out is using horizontal alignment of nanocrystals&#8217; transition dipole moments, such as aligned quantum rods (QRs), which provide directional light emission. Though the IQE for QRs has recently improved significantly, creating efficient and bright green&#8208;emitting QRs (515&#8211;560 nm) remains a big challenge, which is essential for full&#8208;color display applications. In this study, a uniform and highly bright green&#8208;emitting CdSe/ZnxCd1&#8208;xS QRs of gradient shell structure are synthesized with minimized shell thickness and reduced Zn content, coupled with shorter organic ligands to reduce the energy barriers and enhance carriers injection. The electron leakage current at the interface between the polymeric hole transport layer (HTL) and QRs is the primary factor limiting the QRLED's performance. HTL with a higher energy offset is employed to prevent electron leakage at the organic/inorganic interface. Furthermore, is developed a bilayer HTL that enhances hole injections while minimizing electron leakage, thereby improving charge balance. The resulting QRLEDs demonstrate a record&#8208;high efficiency, with an EQE of 24%, current efficiency (CE) of 89 cd&#160;A&#8722;1, and maximum brightness (Lmax) exceeding 500k cd&#160;m&#8722;2. Additionally, they exhibited an extended operational T50 lifetime of over 22k h at 100 cd&#160;m&#8722;2, making them well&#8208;suited for high&#8208;color&#8208;gamut display and lighting applications.

         <title>Conjugation Pathway of Benzobisoxazoles in Polymer Donors Mediates the Charge Management and Enables Organic Solar Cells with Record Certified Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, the conjugation pathway isomerism of the benzobisoxazole (BBO) building block is systematically compared, by which a certified efficiency of 19.1% is obtained in corresponding all&#8208;polymer solar cells.








Abstract

Charge management plays a pivotal role in achieving high&#8208;performance bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs). In this study, two efficient polymer donors are designed, P[4,8]BBO and P[2,6]BBO, by regulating the conjugation pathways of benzobisoxazoles (BBO) through 4,8&#8208; and 2,6&#8208;linkages, respectively. Comparing to P[2,6]BBO, the isomer of conjugation pathway has been proved to enable P[4,8]BBO a shallower highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of &#8722;5.20 eV, significantly enhanced luminescence efficiency, and reduced aggregation property. These improvements lead to a dramatic increase in device efficiencies from 2.6% for P[2,6]BBO:eC9&#8208;2Cl to 19.0% for P[4,8]BBO:eC9&#8208;2Cl. The combined characterizations show that a better comprehensive charge management can be reached in P[4,8]BBO:eC9&#8208;2Cl&#8208;based OSCs, yielding a significantly higher short&#8208;circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF) parameters compared to P[2,6]BBO:eC9&#8208;2Cl&#8208;based&#160;ones. Furthermore, P[4,8]BBO demonstrates good applicability and can achieve an impressive efficiency of 19.4% in all&#8208;polymer solar cells with a third&#8208;party certified efficiency of 19.1%. This work highlights the critical role of conjugation pathway isomerism in mediating polymeric properties and advancing the development of high&#8208;performance multifunctional photovoltaic materials.

In this study, two efficient polymer donors are designed, P[4,8]BBO and P[2,6]BBO, by regulating the conjugation pathways of benzobisoxazoles (BBO) through 4,8- and 2,6-linkages, respectively. Comparing to P[2,6]BBO, the isomer of conjugation pathway has been proved to enable P[4,8]BBO a shallower highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of &#8722;5.20 eV, significantly enhanced luminescence efficiency, and reduced aggregation property. These improvements lead to a dramatic increase in device efficiencies from 2.6% for P[2,6]BBO:eC9-2Cl to 19.0% for P[4,8]BBO:eC9-2Cl. The combined characterizations show that a better comprehensive charge management can be reached in P[4,8]BBO:eC9-2Cl-based OSCs, yielding a significantly higher short-circuit current density (&lt;i&gt;J&lt;sub&gt;SC&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;) and fill factor (FF) parameters compared to P[2,6]BBO:eC9-2Cl-based&#160;ones. Furthermore, P[4,8]BBO demonstrates good applicability and can achieve an impressive efficiency of 19.4% in all-polymer solar cells with a third-party certified efficiency of 19.1%. This work highlights the critical role of conjugation pathway isomerism in mediating polymeric properties and advancing the development of high-performance multifunctional photovoltaic materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cracked Metal&#8211;Phenolic Networks with Durable Confinement Capillarity for Enhanced Solar Desalination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nature&#8208;inspired cracks are introduced into photothermal metal&#8211;phenolic networks (C&#8208;MPNs). These crack patterns can be controlled to optimize water flow, enabling confinement capillarity to enhance the evaporation rate while preventing salt fouling. The cracks also serve as a buffer zone to significantly enhance the stability of the C&#8208;MPNs, overcoming the bottleneck for the practical applications of confinement capillarity.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven interfacial desalination is a promising strategy to address freshwater shortages. Water evaporation can be enhanced through confinement capillarity by generating ultra&#8208;thin water layers on the internal surfaces of porous photothermal materials. However, realizing confinement capillarity relies on coatings composed of aggregated nanospheres, which likely detach under mechanical compression, limiting their practical application. Herein, nature&#8208;inspired crack patterns are introduced into adhesive photothermal supramolecular materials, metal&#8211;phenolic network coatings, forming C&#8208;MPNs to achieve durable confinement capillarity. The crack patterns can be controlled to optimize water transport through narrow channels, enhancing the evaporation rate from 1.6 to 3.3 kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 while preventing salt accumulation during seawater desalination. Furthermore, the cracks serve as buffer zones, significantly improving the mechanical stability of C&#8208;MPN coatings under compression (exhibiting negligible change after 300 cycles)&#8212;overcoming a key challenge that has hindered the practical application of confinement capillarity. Furthermore, due to the enhanced confinement capillarity in C&#8208;MPNs, high evaporation performance is sustained even as the size of the photothermal material increases&#8212;a rare characteristic among 3D photothermal materials. This work provides fundamental insights into the design of photothermal coatings with confinement capillarity, paving the way for their application in solar desalination.

         <title>Active Passivation Charge Transport in n&#8208;i&#8208;p Perovskite Solar Cells Approaching 26% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a synergistic interface engineering strategy for n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite solar cells, integrating active passivation and stacked charge transport. A multifunctional SDBA modifier passivates oxygen vacancies in TiO2 and promotes high&#8208;quality SnO2 deposition, optimizing energy level alignment and carrier dynamics. The resulting devices achieve a record PCE of 25.94% with excellent stability and scalability.








Abstract
In n&#8208;i&#8208;p planar perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the electron transport layer (ETL) and the hole transporting layer play a crucial role in realizing high power conversion efficiency (PCE). Herein, a TiO2&#8208;SDBA&#8208;SnO2 stacked ETL is reported, where 4,4&#8242;&#8208;sulfonyldibenzoic acid (SDBA) serves as an active passivation agent to suppress charge recombination and enhance interface quality. SDBA effectively passivates oxygen vacancies in sputtered TiO2, while simultaneously promoting SnO2 nucleation and improving film quality. Moreover, its molecular structure increases the surface free energy of the ETL, facilitating the formation of high&#8208;quality perovskite films with larger grain sizes and fewer defects. As a result, PSCs with this optimized ETL achieve a PCE of 25.94% with excellent stability. This approach also enables the fabrication of perovskite solar modules with a certified efficiency of 22.55% over a 26.02 cm2 aperture area.

         <title>All&#8208;Season Thermochromic Window With Customizable Optical Switching Temperature and Directional Thermal Radiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes to achieve the utilization of the &#8220;what you see is what you get&#8221;feature during the synthesis process to customize the preparation of PVP liquid with different LCST for user requirements. Meanwhile, an asymmetrical window (PLA window) for all seasons is designed to achieve warmth in winter and coolness in summer, which has the potential for energy conservation and emission reduction.








Abstract
Dynamic all&#8208;season window is a key energy&#8208;saving solution for maintaining indoor thermal comfort. However, current progress faces challenges in balancing weather adaptability, functional tunability, and fabrication costs. This study introduces an all&#8208;season, polyvinyl propional&#8208;liquid&#8208;based asymmetric window. It features a tunable switching temperature ranging from 10 to 70&#160;&#176;C, maintains transparency at temperatures as low as &#8722;15&#160;&#176;C for extended periods, and delivers optimal net cooling (&#8776;246.5&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;2) and heating (&#8776;113.9&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;2) power as derived from the modulation of the optical spectrum, and boasts a service life of over 8 years, with resistance to 1000 thermal shock cycles. The synthesis of the polyvinyl propional liquid involves a zero&#8208;emission process, and the transparent&#8208;to&#8208;cloudy phase transition provides a visually identifiable and theoretically predictable indicator for reaction termination. Additionally, the liquid contains an in situ doped dispersant that functions as a cryoprotectant. Encapsulated between an outward&#8208;facing transparent glass layer and an inward&#8208;facing low&#8208;emissivity glazing, the asymmetric window directional scattering of solar radiation and thermal re&#8208;emission, effectively delivers net cooling in summer and heat retention in winter. This window presents a complementary, affordable, and sustainable solution for enhancing energy efficiency and thermal comfort in diverse climatic conditions.

         <title>Wafer&#8208;Scale Dry&#8208;Transfer of Single&#8208;Crystalline Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The VTCB technique is developed for wafer&#8208;scale, ultra&#8208;clean stacking of single&#8208;crystalline TMDCs with precise angular control. This method overcomes conventional limitations, enhancing interfacial integrity, uniformity, compositional flexibility, and twist&#8208;angle manipulation, exemplified by multilayer 3R&#8208;MoS&#8322; retaining bulk&#8208;like properties. The technique is semiconductor&#8208;process&#8208;compatible, offering a scalable platform for fundamental research and device development.








Abstract
The twisting and stacking of 2D materials have emerged as transformative strategies for discovering novel physical phenomena and designing advanced materials and devices. A significant challenge, however, is achieving pristine interfaces with precise angular control while maintaining the long&#8208;range order over large areas. In this work, a novel dry&#8208;transfer method is presented that enables the ultra&#8208;clean integration of epitaxial, single&#8208;crystalline transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) via vacuum thermocompression bonding (VTCB). This technique facilitates the fabrication of wafer&#8208;scale twisting and stacking of single&#8208;crystalline TMDCs to form homo&#8208;and heterostructures with intrinsic material properties and precise angular control. The layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer reconstruction of single&#8208;crystalline multilayer 2H&#8208;and 3R&#8208;MoS2 is demonstrated, with structural, electrical, and optical properties comparable to those of the bulk counterpart. Furthermore, the approach is fully compatible with standard semiconductor fabrication workflows and equipment, offering a scalable pathway for automated high&#8208;throughput fabrication. This findings provide a new avenue for the large&#8208;scale production of multi&#8208;stacked materials and twist&#8208;electronic device arrays.

         <title>Unique Bioinspired Nanowire Structures for Dual&#8208;Modal Optoelectronic Electronic Skin</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An infrared&#8208;electrical (IE) integrated e&#8208;skin with customizable modes is developed by combining interface assembly technique with mechanical strategies. Benefiting from the tunable engineering of nanowire structures, the Mode I demonstrates an ultrasensitive anisotropic IE e&#8208;skin. In contrast, the Mode II delivers an interference&#8208;resistant e&#8208;skin that maintains stable electrical performance and infrared transmittance under complex deformations.








Abstract
As initial basic applications expand into more complex and diverse fields, including prosthesis, the metaverse, and information encryption, the diversification, multifunctionality, and customization of electronic skin (e&#8208;skin) have increasingly become prominent research trends. However, most e&#8208;skins focus on achieving higher performance and a broader response range, lacking functionality and mode customization options. Here, a mode designable bioinspired e&#8208;skin is reported, utilizing a mechanical strategy combined with interface assembly technology, and achieving the integration of optical and electrical sensing capabilities in single functional material. Benefiting from the tunable engineering of nanowire structures, the Mode I demonstrates for the first time an anisotropic infrared&#8208;electrical combined e&#8208;skin, achieving remarkable anisotropic electrical performance with an anisotropy index (GF1/GF2) greater than 104 and stable anisotropy infrared transmittance changes even after 105 cycles at 75% strain. On the other hand, the Mode II offers an interference&#8208;resistant e&#8208;skin that maintains stable electrical performance and infrared transmittance under complex deformations based on novel 3D buckled structure. Finally, the two modes are integrated and successfully applied to the multiple encryption of customized information, presenting significant potential for confidential military projects.

         <title>Halogen&#8208;Bonded Liquid Crystal Elastomers as Initiator&#8208;Free Photochemical Actuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of dynamic disulfide bonds and halogen bonds in chain&#8208;extended liquid crystal elastomers enables the fabrication of photochemical actuators without the need for a photoinitiator, advancing the design of multimodal soft actuators that can be reprogrammed and reprocessed through supramolecular functionalization.








Abstract
Photochemically driven liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) actuators require precise arrangement and sufficiently high concentration of photoswitchable molecules for effective actuation. Achieving both high photoswitch content and a high degree of molecular alignment has been challenging especially in thick samples, but is essential for future applications in soft robotics, biomedicine, and photonic technologies. In this work, this issue is addressed by combining dynamic halogen bonds with Aza&#8211;Michael addition&#8208;based polymerization, creating azobenzene&#8208;containing LCEs with multimodal actuation capabilities. These highly directional supramolecular interactions eliminate the need for a photo&#8208;initiator in the LCE fabrication process, enabling control over the azobenzene content over a wide range while maintaining a high degree of molecular alignment and dynamic programming ability. The potential of this approach is demonstrated through proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept examples such as light&#8208;guided rolling movement and underwater gripping, underscoring the versatility of the weak, dynamic halogen bonds in advancing the supramolecular design of multimodal soft actuators.

         <title>Unleashing the Kinetic Limitation of Co&#8208;Free Li&#8208;Rich Mn&#8208;Based Cathodes via Ionic/Electronic Dual&#8208;Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tetra&#8208;effect integration of Na+/F&#8722; dual&#8208;ion surface doping effectively eliminates the intrinsic kinetic limitations of cobalt&#8208;free lithium&#8208;rich manganese&#8208;based cathode materials, maintains highly stable interfaces, and achieves dual benefits in cycling performance and energy density, providing novel insights for the industrialization of cobalt&#8208;free lithium&#8208;rich manganese&#8208;based solutions.








Abstract
Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based oxide (LRMO) are promising cathode candidates for next&#8208;generation Li&#8208;ion batteries with combined cost&#8208;effectiveness and high specific capacity. Designing Co&#8208;free LRMO can further leverage the low cost of this class of cathodes given the capacity can be maintained. However, implementing cobalt&#8208;free LRMO cathode materials are hampered by their sluggish kinetics, resulting in low capacity and poor rate performance that underperform compared with their Co&#8208;containing counterparts. Here, it is confirmed that the slow kinetics of Co&#8208;free LRMO originates from the structural disorder caused by transition metals (TMs) migration at high voltages (above 4.5&#160;V Vs. Li+/Li) and consequent irreversible oxygen redox process. Aware of this, Na+/F&#8722; is introduced in surficial lattice to alleviate these issues, ultimately achieving improved discharge voltage (&#8776;0.2&#160;V above 1 C, 1 C = 0.25 A g&#8722;1), exceptional cycle stability in pouch&#8208;type cell (95.1% capacity retention in 1 C after 400 cycles at 25&#160;&#176;C, and 80.9% capacity retention after 300 cycles in 0.5 C at 45&#160;&#176;C) and excellent C&#8208;rate performance (&#8776;150&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 5 C). The newly developed Na+/F&#8722; gradient design unleashes the surficial charge transfer kinetics limitation and greatly improves the lattice structure stability, consequently providing valuable guidelines for future high&#8208;capacity LRMO cathode design.

         <title>Schottky MSM&#8208;Structured Tribovoltaic Nanogenerator Enabling Over 25,000 nC Charge Transfer via Single Droplet Impact</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tribovoltaic nanogenerator featuring a Schottky MSM architecture utilizes triboelectric potential to modulate carrier transport. The device leverages interfacial state density and surface conductance engineering to maintain a tunable Schottky barrier. This strategy enables high charge output per droplet and rapid energy storage, showing potential for scalable and practical energy harvesting applications.








Abstract
Using water droplets to generate electricity is an attractive approach for addressing the energy crisis. However, achieving high charge transfer and power output in such systems remains a major challenge. Here, a tribovoltaic nanogenerator (TVNG) is developed based on a specially designed Schottky metal&#8208;semiconductor&#8208;metal (MSM) structure. This device is capable of efficiently converting the kinetic energy of water droplets into electricity. To improve performance, a patterned interface layer between the metal and semiconductor is introduced, which helps guide charge flow and control surface conductivity. Upon droplet impact, the mechanical friction between the liquid and the surface generates a potential that activates charge transport across the Schottky barrier. This breaks the equilibrium state and enhances carrier movement. As a result, the device achieves a record&#8208;high charge output of 25500&#160;nC from a single droplet, along with an output energy of 5.8&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8315;&#8310;&#160;J. To showcase scalability, a TVNG module with 60 cells on a 3&#8208;inch wafer delivers milliamp&#8208;level current and charges a 220&#160;&#181;F capacitor to 0.6&#160;V within 2&#160;s. The effects of processing, materials, structure, and droplet properties are studied to guide the future design of high&#8208;efficiency Schottky MSM&#8208;based TVNG.

         <title>Robust Mix&#8208;Charged Polyzwitterionic Hydrogels for Ultra&#8208;Efficient Atmospheric Water Harvesting and Evaporative Cooling</title>

Conventional atmospheric water&#8208;harvesting&#160;hydrogels prioritize hygroscopicity at the expense of mechanics, hindering its practical applications. The proposed hygroscopic&#160;mix&#8208;charged polyzwitterionic hydrogel(THMPH)&#160;achieves a trade&#8208;off between high water absorption and exceptional mechanical robustness through a strength gradient&#8208;enhanced ionic cross&#8208;linking structure synergized with improvelithium chloride&#160;binding affinity.&#160;This design strategy significantly expands applicability to diverse practical implementations including photovoltaic thermal management.








Abstract
Atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) presents great potential in addressing the increasing global challenges in freshwater and energy supply, especially in arid and semi&#8208;arid regions. The recent AWH materials focus primarily on maximizing water uptake,&#160;while conventional approaches prioritize hygroscopicity at the expense of mechanical integrity, which severely limits their applicability in real&#8208;world scenarios. In this study, a novel tunable hygroscopic mix&#8208;charged polyzwitterionic hydrogel (THMPH) is reported that achieves dual excellence in outstanding moisture absorbency and mechanical robustness. Owing to the broad ionic crosslink's degree enabling the rigid skeletal framework and energy&#8208;dissipative sacrificial networks, THMPH exhibits more than 200 times higher mechanical ductility (225&#160;kPa tensile strength retention at 200% mass swelling ratio) in comparison with the commonly&#8208;used AWH zwitterionic polybetaine. The optimized topological structure coupled with improved lithium chloride&#160;binding affinity results in excellent water uptake (2.9&#160;g&#160;g&#8722;1 at 25&#160;&#176;C, 70% RH). When THMPH is used for daytime photovoltaic panel cooling, it can provide a 15&#160;&#176;C temperature reduction of a PV panel under 1&#160;kW&#160;m&#8722;2 solar irradiation, resulting in a 7.33% increase in solar energy conversion efficiency. This hydrogel design paradigm, synergizing superior hygroscopicity with&#160;exceptional mechanical robustness, demonstrates significant potential for advancing practical applications.

         <title>Local Recruitment of Autologous Stem Cells via a Targeting Microgel for Precise Cartilage Repair without Surgery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An antibody&#8208;modified hydrogel microsphere containing TGF&#946; affinity peptides (TRG microsphere) is designed and synthesized to precisely target multiple scattered cartilage injury sites in advanced osteoarthritis. It can locally capture endogenous TGF&#946; to recruit bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and promote their differentiation into chondrocytes, thereby achieving precise hyaline cartilage repair in vivo without surgery.








Abstract
The treatment of advanced osteoarthritis (OA) remains clinically intractable due to the inability to regenerate multifocal cartilage defects, stemming from poor targeted recruitment of bone marrow&#8208;derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and the absence of a sustained chondrogenic microenvironment at the injury sites. In this work, an antibody&#8208;mediated gelatin methacrylate&#8208;based hydrogel microsphere modified by TGF&#946;&#8208;affinity peptides (TRG microsphere) is developed, to precisely target and repair scattered cartilage injuries by only intraarticular injection without any surgical assistance. By leveraging the specific expression of type I collagen in OA cartilage lesions, the type I collagen antibodies anchoring on TRG's surface enable the specific and accurate targeting of the multiple injury areas that need regeneration. In the meantime, the TGF&#946;&#8208;affinity peptides incorporated in the TRG microsphere can capture the endogenous TGF&#946;, a growth factor that can recruit BMSCs and promote their differentiation, to precisely induce the hyaline&#8208;like cartilage regeneration locally. In a rat model of advanced OA, a single intra&#8208;articular injection of TRG microspheres can repair scattered cartilage defects, restore glycosaminoglycan deposition, and alleviate joint dysfunction. This study proposes an injection&#8208;based strategy that enables continuous recruitment of endogenous BMSCs for precise cartilage regeneration, eliminating complex invasive procedures and patient discomfort.

         <title>Asymmetric Single&#8208;Unit&#8208;Cell Layer Enriching Polar Inherent Hydroxyls Eliminates Interlayer Electric Field Shielding Effect and In Situ Self&#8208;Polarize for Piezocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of Bi2O2(OH)(NO3) monolayer with strong force&#8208;sensitivity eliminates interlayer electric field screening induced by H bond between [Bi2O2OH] and [NO3] layers, resulting in larger piezoelectricity and strengthened internal electric field (IEF). It also incurs sufficient surface polar inherent hydroxyls, benefiting surface charge carrier decoupling and more favorable H2O molecules adsorption and H* desorption. Mechanical strain can induce in situ self&#8208;polarization, which further boosts IEF and reduces energy barriers of H* desorption and key intermediate *OH formation, facilitating piezocatalytic water splitting.








Abstract
Piezocatalytic two&#8208;electron water splitting into spontaneously isolated H2 and H2O2 shows huge prospects in meeting industrial requirements. Herein, asymmetric single&#8208;unit&#8208;cell Bi2O2(OH)(NO3) monolayer (BON&#8208;M) with superb force&#8208;sensitivity are developed for pure water and seawater dissociation. The formation of a monolayer structure allows sufficient exposure of polar inherent hydroxyls and eliminates the interlayer electric field screening induced by hydrogen bonding between [Bi2O2OH] slices and [NO3] layers, resulting in larger piezoelectricity and strengthened internal electric field. It also benefits surface charge carrier decoupling and renders more favorable H2O molecules adsorption and H* desorption. Particularly, the mechanical strain can induce the in situ self&#8208;polarization of BON&#8208;M, which further enhances electric field intensity and reduces energy barriers of H* desorption and key intermediate *OH formation, facilitating water splitting to H2 and H2O2 kinetically and thermodynamically. An exceptional piezocatalytic H2 and H2O2 production rate up to 2071.05 and 970.27&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 is delivered by BON&#8208;M from pure water. It also accumulates H2 output of 12&#8201;429.68&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 within 8&#160;h from seawater splitting, along with mechanical&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen efficiency of 0.15%. This work develops an effective strategy for exploiting high&#8208;performance piezocatalyst by building ultrafine nanostructure enriched with inherent polar groups on the surface.

         <title>Atomically&#8208;Thin Freestanding Racetrack Memory Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin and flexible freestanding racetrack membranes are fabricated using a water&#8208;soluble Sr3Al2O6 release layer, without a buffer between the release layer and the magnetic heterostructure. The absence of any buffer layer enables local modulation of the current&#8208; and field&#8208;induced manipulation of the racetrack magnetization via direct coupling with patterned platinum underlayers, showing potential for advanced spintronic applications.








Abstract
Advances in freestanding membranes allow novel heterostructures to be formed from distinct families of materials in 2D or 3D configurations. Recently, this technique has been used to form a 3D racetrack memory device by transferring a complex magnetic thin film heterostructure, in the form of a membrane, onto a corrugated surface. The membrane is released using a water&#8208;soluble oxide layer (Sr3Al2O6). The magnetic structure within the membrane is supported by a thin buffer layer (MgO), which decouples the magnetic structure from the receiving surface. Here it is shown that ultrathin freestanding racetrack membranes can be formed without any buffer layer and that the current&#8208;induced motion of magnetic domain walls within the transferred racetrack is highly efficient. Furthermore, the absence of any buffer layer enables local engineering of the racetracks via their direct coupling with pre&#8208;patterned platinum underlayers on which they are placed. The presence or absence of the Pt underlayer allows for local modulation of the current and field&#8208;induced manipulation of the racetrack magnetization. In addition, the ultrathin freestanding membranes exhibit excellent flexibility and enable highly reliable racetrack devices. The findings highlight the potential of freestanding magnetic heterostructure membranes for advanced spintronic applications.

         <title>Breaking the Vicious Spiral to Suppress Oxygen Loss in Li&#8208;Rich Oxide Cathode Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism of oxygen loss/redox in layered Li&#8322;MnO&#8323; and spinel Li&#8324;Mn&#8325;O&#8321;&#8322; is comparatively studied. The nanovoids as a result of the vicious spiral between O&#9472;O dimerization and TM migration, facilitate O2 release in Li2MnO3, whereas O2 is trapped in stable Li4Mn5O12. Unraveling the correlation between structural rearrangement and O&#8208;redox reversibility sheds light on designing of advanced oxide cathode materials.








Abstract
The irreversible oxygen loss (O&#8208;loss) hinders the application of oxygen redox (O&#8208;redox) cathode material in high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li/Na&#8208;ion batteries. Although O&#8208;loss is commonly associated with O2 release, the underlying mechanism remains unclear, which is not a simple surface problem. Herein, the O&#8208;loss/redox behaviors of the layered Li2MnO3 and spinel Li4Mn5O12 are comparatively investigated through experiments and density functional theory (DFT)&#160;calculations. It shows that the vicious spiral between O&#9472;O dimerization and Mn migration drive the void growth, chain&#8208;like structural collapse, and O2 release in Li2MnO3. In contrast, the stable spinel framework and inert O in O&#8208;LiMn3 coordination of Li4Mn5O12 break this spiral and trap O2 within the bulk, ensuring a reversible O&#8208;redox. By atomically compositing Li4Mn5O12 with LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4, a novel Co&#8208;free Li&#8208;rich spinel oxide (LRSO) with high energy density (&gt;1000&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1) is produced. These findings clarify the correlation between structural rearrangement and O&#8208;redox and contribute to the design of advanced O&#8208;redox cathode materials.

         <title>A Metabolism&#8208;Oriented Strategy to Directly Generate Photosensitizer&#8208;Engineered Extracellular Vesicles from Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward and effective metabolic approach utilizing glucose&#8208;modified photosensitizer as substrate is employed for the in situ biosynthesis of engineered extracellular vesicles (EVs) enriched with photosensitizers. This strategy offers increased yield and high labeling efficiency of engineered EVs. Moreover, the extracted engineered EVs exhibite excellent targeting ability and superior photodynamic therapy efficacy for inducing tumor ablation.








Abstract
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) hold great potential for delivering cancer therapy drugs. However, limited efficiency and sophisticated drug encapsulation procedures have hindered their effectiveness. Herein, &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;glucose is modified with the synthesized photosensitizer (1&#8208;(4&#8208;carboxybutyl)&#8208;4&#8208;(7&#8208;(4&#8208;(diphenylamino)phenyl)benzo[c][1,2,5] thiadiazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl)pyridin&#8208;1&#8208;ium, named TB) via amide bond to form a glucose&#8208;conjugated photosensitizer, referred to as TBG, which is further utilized as a metabolic substrate for cancer cells. Through simple co&#8208;incubation with TBG, cancer cells directly generate TBG&#8208;engineered EVs in situ via a metabolism&#8208;driven process, in which glucose transporters play a critical role. Notably, a higher yield of engineered EVs is observed in TBG&#8208;treated cells compared to the TB&#8208;treated group. This enhancement could be attributed to increased glucose transporter activity and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis, highlighting the significance of glucose&#8208;modified chemicals. Remarkably, this metabolism&#8208;driven strategy has been successfully validated across three cell lines, highlighting its versatility and broad applicability. The extracted TBG&#8208;EVs maintain a strong targeting ability toward cancer cells and demonstrate enhanced efficacy in photodynamic therapy for tumor ablation. The study offers an alternative strategy to efficiently produce cargo&#8208;loading EVs via direct biological metabolism.

         <title>Excellent Energy Storage Performance of Polymorphic Modulated Antiferroelectric Lead Zirconate Ceramic</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A special antiferroelectric state composed of the coexistence of polymorphic polarization configurations has been identified, and two completely different non&#8208;ergodic relaxor ferroelectric states are sequentially induced from its matrix. This kind of phase transition simultaneously provides high maximum polarization and fast domain dynamics response. The energy storage density exceeds 23 J&#160;cm&#8722;3, and the energy storage efficiency can reach 88%.








Abstract
Multiphase transition type antiferroelectric lead zirconate is one of the ideal candidate dielectrics for energy storage ceramic capacitors, it is challenging to fully reveal its formation and regulation mechanism, and further enhance the energy storage performance. Here, the essence of polymorphic modulation of multiphase transition antiferroelectric is proposed, and its non&#8208;ergodic relaxor phase transition nature is revealed. The polymorphic modulated antiferroelectric ceramics show a giant energy storage density of 23.73 J&#160;cm&#8722;3 and an excellent efficiency of 88%, which is much superior to the commensurate and incommensurate modulated antiferroelectric phases and other dielectric ceramics. The polymorphic modulated antiferroelectric ceramic is composed of both commensurate and incommensurate modulated ferrielectric like antiferroelectric sub&#8208;grain regions. Under an electric field, relaxor ferroelectric and ferroelectric phases are successively derived from the incommensurate and commensurate antiferroelectric regions, constituting two distinct non&#8208;ergodic relaxor ferroelectric states. The independent evolution of antiferroelectric short&#8208;range to ferroelectric short&#8208;range and ferroelectric long&#8208;range, and their interaction are the key to the excellent energy storage performance of polymorphic modulated antiferroelectric ceramics. The findings offer a novel insight into the field&#8208;induced phase transition in antiferroelectric, and promote the potential applications of pulse power antiferroelectric ceramic capacitors.

         <title>Heterocluster&#8208;Assembled Crystalline Hydrophobic Complexes with Delayed Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first heterocluster MOF, SnCu&#8208;mMBA&#8208;dia, integrating [Sn4O8] and [Cu8S8] SBUs via a bifunctional m&#8208;mercaptobenzoic acid (D&#8208;A ligand) is presented. The donor&#8211;acceptor heterojunction spatially separates HOMO ([Cu8S8] core) and LUMO (carboxylate), enabling thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) through minimized &#916;EST, driven by D&#8208;A ligand&#8208;enhanced CT&#8208;state emission. mMBA suppresses nonradiative decay while hydrophobic Sn&#8324; units confer hydrolytic stability without quenching Cu&#8211;S luminescence. This work pioneers heterocluster MOFs for stable optoelectronic materials.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with metal&#9472;sulfur bonds exhibit unique electrical, redox, and optical properties. However, their development has been hindered by rapid nucleation during crystallization. To address this challenge, amine&#8208;based modulators to retard nucleation through competitive coordination with ligands, enabling the synthesis of a series of Cu&#8208;S cluster&#8208;based MOFs with diverse network topologies: Cu&#8208;BDT&#8208;hcb (1), Cu&#8208;TBT&#8208;acs (2), Cu&#8208;TBT&#8208;pcu (3), Cu&#8208;TBT&#8208;sql (4), Cu&#8208;TBT&#8208;dia (5), and Cu&#8208;TBT&#8208;hcb (6), are utilized. Using donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) ligands (o/p&#8208;mercaptobenzoic acid&#8212;o/pMBA), [Sn4]&#8208;based MOFs: Sn&#8208;oDTBA&#8208;cds (7) and Sn&#8208;pDTBA&#8208;pcu (8), are fabricated. During synthesis, sulfhydryl groups underwent reductive coupling to generate novel dicarboxylate ligands with disulfide (S&#8211;S) linkages. Notably, the first bimetallic heterocluster MOF, SnCu&#8208;mMBA&#8208;dia (9), incorporating both a metal&#8208;oxygen cluster [Sn4O2(carboxylate)4] and a metal&#8208;sulfur cluster [Cu8(thiolate)8] is developed. This framework, constructed using m&#8208;mercaptobenzoic acid (mMBA) as a D&#8211;A bifunctional ligand, exhibits spatially separated HOMO and LUMO, minimizing the singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap to promote thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). Compound 9 also demonstrates exceptional hydrolytic stability due to steric shielding by hydrophobic organotin moieties. This work pioneers a modulator&#8208;assisted strategy for heterocluster MOF construction, offering a paradigm for designing stable luminescent materials with tailored optoelectronic functionalities.

Using donor-acceptor (D-A) ligands (&lt;i&gt;o/p&lt;/i&gt;-mercaptobenzoic acid&#8212;&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sup&gt;o/p&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;MBA), [Sn&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]-based MOFs: Sn-&lt;i&gt;

   &lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;DTBA-pcu (&lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt;), are fabricated. During synthesis, sulfhydryl groups underwent reductive coupling to generate novel dicarboxylate ligands with disulfide (S&#8211;S) linkages. Notably, the first bimetallic heterocluster MOF, SnCu-&lt;i&gt;

This framework, constructed using &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;-mercaptobenzoic acid (&lt;i&gt;

Compound &lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt; also demonstrates exceptional hydrolytic stability due to steric shielding by hydrophobic organotin moieties.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Phototransistor Based on a 2D Polybenzimidazole Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crystalline 2D polybenzimidazole polymer (2DPBI), incorporating a porphyrin&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;system linked via 1,3&#8208;diazole units, is synthesized on the water surface over large areas. The 2DPBI thin&#8208;film exhibits high charge carrier mobility (&#8776;240 cm2&#160;V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, measured by terahertz spectroscopy), strong photoresponse, and band&#8208;like transport, enabling phototransistor performance with a detectivity of 2.0 &#215; 1013 Jones, highlighting its potential for high&#8208;performance optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
Photodetectors are fundamental components of modern optoelectronics, enabling the conversion of light into electrical signals. The development of high&#8208;performance phototransistors necessitates materials with both high charge carrier mobility and robust photoresponse. However, achieving both in a single material poses challenges due to inherent trade&#8208;offs. Herein, this study introduces a polybenzimidazole&#8208;(1,3&#8208;diazole)&#8208;based 2D polymer (2DPBI), synthesized as few&#8208;layer, crystalline films covering &#8776;28 cm2 on the water surface at room temperature, with large crystalline domain sizes ranging from 110 to 140 &#181;m2. The 2DPBI incorporates a &#960;&#8208;conjugated photoresponsive porphyrin motif through a 1,3&#8208;diazole linkage, exhibiting enhanced &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization, a narrow direct band gap of &#8776;1.18&#160;eV, a small reduced electron&#8211;hole effective mass (m* = 0.171&#160;m0), and a very high resonant absorption coefficient of up to 106 cm&#8722;1. Terahertz spectroscopy reveals excellent short&#8208;range charge carrier mobility of &#8776;240 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. Temperature&#8208;dependent photoconductivity measurements and theoretical calculations confirm a band&#8208;like charge transport mechanism. Leveraging these features, 2DPBI&#8208;based phototransistors demonstrate an on/off ratio exceeding 108, photosensitivity of 1.08 &#215; 107, response time of 1.1&#160;ms, and detectivity of 2.0 &#215; 1013 Jones, surpassing previously reported standalone few&#8208;layer 2D materials and are on par with silicon photodetectors. The unique characteristics of 2DPBI make it a promising foundation for future optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Spatially Resolved Observation of Ferroelectric&#8208;to&#8208;Paraelectric Phase Transition in a Two&#8208;Dimensional Halide Perovskite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Temperature&#8208;dependent nanoscale ferroelectric domain evolution and the ferroelectric&#8208;to&#8208;paraelectric phase transition in 2D halide perovskites is visualized using piezoresponse force microscopy. The phase transition initiates locally below the Curie temperature and progressively propagates as paraelectric regions expand. Landau&#8211;Ginzburg&#8211;Devonshire theory identifies a second&#8208;order phase transition, consistent with the gradual evolution of ferroelectric domains.








Abstract
2D halide perovskite ferroelectrics have garnered significant attention due to their potential applications and intriguing fundamental properties. However, their temperature&#8208;dependent ferroelectric behaviors, particularly at the nanoscale, remain poorly understood. In this study, the nanoscale ferroelectric domain evolution with temperature and ferroelectric&#8208;to&#8208;paraelectric phase transition in (BA)2(MA)Pb2Br7 films are investigated using piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM). Angle&#8208;resolved lateral PFM (LPFM) reveals a complex in&#8208;plane ferroelectric domain structure. Temperature&#8208;dependent LPFM measurements clearly show that the Curie temperature (TC) is &#8776;353 K, as confirmed by other macroscopic measurements. Notably, it is observed that the ferroelectric&#8208;to&#8208;paraelectric phase transition initiates locally even below TC. As the temperature increases, large ferroelectric domains fragment into smaller ones and the regions with the novel LPFM phase signal emerge, indicating a local phase transition. Furthermore, temperature&#8208;dependent LPFM spectroscopy demonstrates a progressive weakening of the ferroelectricity. The analysis based on Landau&#8211;Ginzburg&#8211;Devonshire theory identifies a second&#8208;order phase transition, consistent with the gradual evolution of nanoscale ferroelectric domains observed in LPFM images. This spatially resolved observation of phase transition provides critical insights into the temperature&#8208;dependent ferroelectric properties of 2D halide perovskite ferroelectrics and establishes a foundational framework for their future device applications.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient organic D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A scintillators with temperature adaptability are presented, achieved through strategic fluorine atom modification of &#960;&#8208;bridge. These materials simultaneously exhibit TADF, AIDF, and RTP that dynamically respond to environmental changes under ultraviolet excitation. Their PLQYs can reach up to 88% in PMMA films. Notably, 1FAT@PMMA exhibits excellent radioluminescence performance, achieving a remarkably low detection limit of 62.27 nGy&#160;s&#8722;1 and an impressive spatial resolution of 20 lp&#160;mm&#8722;1.








Abstract
Achieving highly efficient organic scintillators for X&#8208;ray imaging remains a significant challenge, primarily owing to the inherent difficulty in facilitating rapid radiative decays of both singlet and triplet excitons. To address this limitation, a novel design strategy is introduced that incorporated fluorine atoms to modify the &#960;&#8208;bridge of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A molecules, thereby fine&#8208;tuning their electronic structures and photophysical properties. The emitters, namely 1FAT and 2FAT, show excellent thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), aggregation&#8208;induced delayed fluorescence (AIDF), and room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) excited by ultraviolet light varying with surrounding environments. Notably, the doped PMMA film of 1FAT exhibites intense emission across a broad temperature range from 77 to 363 K, showcasing its adaptability to diverse thermal conditions. More importantly, 1FAT@PMMA film exhibits excellent radioluminescence performance under X&#8208;ray excitation with a low detection limit of 62.27 nGy&#160;s&#8722;1 and a high spatial resolution of over 20 lp&#160;mm&#8722;1. This study introduces a novel and fundamental design strategy for developing efficient, temperature&#8208;adaptive D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A organic scintillators, significantly expanding their potential applications in flexible, stretchable X&#8208;ray detectors and advanced imaging technologies.

Low&#8208;platinum&#8208;group metal (low&#8208;PGM) catalysts play a vital role in reducing the cost of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). In this study, an axially Cl&#8208;coordinated Pt&#8208;Co dual atom on N&#8208;doped graphitic carbon catalyst (denoted as Pt1Co1/NC&#8211;Cl) is rationally designed. Owing to the axial chlorine ligand and asymmetric coordination environment, the catalyst exhibits significantly enhanced oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity under acidic conditions.








Abstract
Low&#8208;platinum&#8208;group metal (low&#8208;PGM) catalysts play a crucial role in reducing the cost of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Dual&#8208;atomic catalysts offer valuable solutions due to their exceptional performance. This work explores the application of axial Cl&#8208;coordinated Pt&#9472;Co dual atoms on N&#8208;doped graphitic carbon (Pt1Co1/NC&#9472;Cl) catalysts utilizing PtCo dual&#8208;atomic catalysts, demonstrating their ability to significantly enhance the acidic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalytic performance of conventional PtCo catalysts. The half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2) reaches 0.841 V in a 0.1 M HClO4 solution, and only a reduction of 12 mV in E1/2 is observed after 5000 cycles. Axial Cl proves to be resistant to removal during the electroreduction reaction. Consequently, the use of heteroatom&#8208;modulated asymmetric structures can greatly improve the performance of Pt&#8208;based catalysts. Incorporating nonmetallic synergistic Pt&#8208;group metals presents a promising solution for achieving high&#8208;performance Low&#8208;PGMs.

         <title>Tuning Surface Coordination Environment of Ni3N by Fluorine Modification for Efficient Methanol Electrooxidation Assisted Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a fluorine&#8208;modified Ni3N electrocatalyst for the efficient methanol oxidation reaction (MOR)&#8208;coupled hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Fluorine tuning enhances surface reconstruction, optimizing activity and stability. The catalyst achieves exceptional bifunctional performance, offering insights into electrocatalyst regulation and surface dynamics in electrochemical oxidation.








Abstract
Replacing the kinetically sluggish oxygen evolution reaction with the thermodynamically favorable methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) represents a promising strategy for energy&#8208;efficient hydrogen production. However, optimizing electrocatalytic performance in the coupled hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and MOR requires precise regulation of the electrochemical coordination environment and a fundamental understanding of activity origins, posing a significant challenge. Here, a scalable strategy is developed that harnesses the high electronegativity of fluorine (F) to tailor the coordination environment of Ni3N, enhancing HER kinetics. Concurrently, adsorbed F&#160;ions induce rapid and extensive self&#8208;reconstruction of the Ni3N surface during MOR by dynamically modulating interfacial ion concentrations (OH&#8315; and Ni species). This reconstruction enhances catalytic activity and enables the selective oxidation of methanol to formate via a sequential pathway, involving primary O&#8208;H bond activation followed by subsequent C&#8208;H bond cleavage at Ni active sites. Consequently, F10&#8208;Ni3N demonstrates exceptional bifunctional performance, delivering 2.02&#160;V and remarkable stability (600&#160;h) for MOR&#8208;coupled hydrogen production in a membrane electrode assembly&#8208;based flow electrolyzer at an industrially relevant current density of 200&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. This work establishes a dual&#8208;regulation paradigm for electrocatalysts, offering mechanistic insights into surface reconstruction and a rational design framework for next&#8208;generation energy conversion systems.

         <title>Molecularly Interlocked Interfaces Enable Record&#8208;Efficiency Stretchable Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dual&#8208;phase interface engineering strategy synergizes molecular&#8208;scale topological entanglement with mesoscale gradient modulus transitions, enabling organic solar cells to achieve record&#8208;breaking PCE of 19.58% while maintaining &gt;10% efficiency at 100% strain&#8208;unprecedented in stretchable energy devices.








Abstract
The development of stretchable organic solar cells (s&#8208;OSCs) demands concurrent breakthroughs in mechanical compliance and electronic properties, and the challenge is rooted in the intrinsic mechanical mismatch between organic semiconductors and metal electrodes. Here, this study proposes dual&#8208;phase interface engineering strategies to reconcile these conflicting requirements through molecularly interlocked conductive elastomers. Dynamic stress dissipation through dynamic bond plasticity is achieved by embedding a 3D interpenetrating conducting elastomer network within the electron transport layer (ETL). The strategy creates gradient modulus interfaces through Ag coordination&#8208;enabled nanocomposite bonding, suppressing crack propagation velocities and reduces the interfacial mechanical mismatch phenomenon. Eventually, the PCE of 19.58% is achieved on the small&#8208;area flexible devices, which is one of the highest PCEs for flexible organic solar cells (f&#8208;OSCs) to date. Notably, the stretchable devices retain over the PCE of 10% under 100% tensile strain, surpassing previous stretchable photovoltaic devices. To further validate the potential of this strategy for large&#8208;area module applications, 25 cm2&#8208;based flexible and stretchable modules are prepared with PCEs of 16.74% and 14.48%, respectively. The work redefines material design rules for deformable electronics by establishing a generic mechanically adaptive framework that synchronizes interfacial dynamics across molecular to macroscopic scales.

         <title>Manipulating Ferroelectric Topological Polar Structures with Twisted Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate dynamic control of ferroelectric order in quasi&#8208;2D CsBiNb2O7 using twisted ultraviolet light carrying orbital angular momentum. Our approach harnesses non&#8208;resonant multiphoton absorption and induced strain to modulate topological of ferroelectric polarization textures. In&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray coherent imaging and Raman spectroscopy reveal reversible, nanoscale polarization transitions, enabling efficient stabilization of topological solitons and paving the way for novel optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
The dynamic control of non&#8208;equilibrium states represents a central challenge in condensed matter physics. While intense terahertz fields drive metal&#8208;insulator transitions and ferroelectricity via soft phonon modes, recent theory suggests that twisted light with orbital angular momentum (OAM) offers a distinct route to manipulate ferroelectric order and stabilize topological excitations including skyrmions, vortices, and Hopfions. Control of ferroelectric polarization in quasi&#8208;2D CsBiNb2O7 (CBNO) is demonstrated using non&#8208;resonant twisted ultra&#8208;violet (UV) light (375 nm, 800 THz). Combining in situ X&#8208;ray Bragg coherent diffractive imaging (BCDI), twisted optical Raman spectroscopy, and density functional theory (DFT), three&#8208;dimensional (3D) ionic displacements, strain fields, and polarization changes are resolved in single crystals. Operando measurements reveal light&#8208;induced strain hysteresis under twisted light&#8211;a hallmark of nonlinear, history&#8208;dependent ferroelastic switching driven by OAM. Discrete, irreversible domain transitions emerge as the topological charge &#8467; is cycled, stabilizing non&#8208;trivial domain textures including vortex&#8208;antivortex pairs, Bloch/anti&#8208;Bloch points, and merons. These persist after OAM removal, indicating a memory effect. Competing mechanisms are discussed, including multiphoton absorption, strain&#8208;mediated polarization switching, and defect&#8208;wall interactions. The findings establish structured light as a tool for deterministic, reversible control of ferroic states, enabling optically reconfigurable non&#8208;volatile&#160;devices.

         <title>Phonon Driven Ferroelectricity and Raman Active Modes in Hybrid Organic&#8208;Inorganic Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferroelectric domains, a hallmark of ferroelectricity, are studied using temperature&#8208;dependent Raman spectroscopy to uncover characteristic phonons associated with ferroelectric phase transitions in different n&#8208;value HOIPs. Higher n&#8208;value HOIP demonstrate a reduced ferroelectric switching energy barrier, providing valuable insights for optimizing domain&#8208;related properties in ferroelectric devices.








Abstract
Hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) have emerged as promising ferroelectric semiconductors, yet the phonon signatures governing their ferroelectricity remain poorly understood.

&lt;p&gt;Ferroelectric domains, a hallmark of ferroelectricity, are studied using temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy to uncover characteristic phonons associated with ferroelectric phase transitions in different &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-value HOIPs. Higher &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-value HOIP demonstrate a reduced ferroelectric switching energy barrier, providing valuable insights for optimizing domain-related properties in ferroelectric devices.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) have emerged as promising ferroelectric semiconductors, yet the phonon signatures governing their ferroelectricity remain poorly understood. Here, by analyzing the temperature-dependent Raman peak profiles of highly ordered ferroelectric domains in HOIPs, a framework to systematically investigate the dimensionality (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;)-dependent phonons that are critical to ferroelectric behaviour is established. By tracking phonon evolution across the ferroelectric-to-paraelectric phase transition in HOIPs with different &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;, characteristic modes associated with the ferroelectric symmetry-breaking process are identified. Notably, in the ferroelectric phase of (BA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(MA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Pb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 3), these modes exhibit a redshift compared to those in (BA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(MA)Pb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 2), reflecting a reduced energy barrier for ferroelectric switching. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further correlate these modes with their spectral signatures in Raman spectroscopy, particularly highlighting zone-boundary modes that diminish upon transitioning to the paraelectric phase. Polarized Raman mapping further reveals adjacent ferroelectric domains with orthogonal polarization orientations, directly linking phonon activity to domain configuration.

         <title>Intranasal and Intravenous Sequential Administration of Survivin Peptide&#8208;CpG Nanovaccines Elicits Potent Immunity Toward Glioblastoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A survivin peptide&#8208;CpG nanovaccine, SPOD&#8208;NV, is designed for GBM immunotherapy. Using a strategic sequential administration through intranasal and intravenous routes, it capitalizes on the advantages of both methods exhibiting enhanced accumulation in tumors, NALT, CLNs and spleen. Combined with anti&#8208;CTLA&#8208;4 therapy, it effectively activates local and systemic T&#8208;cell and humoral responses, achieving 43% complete remission and long&#8208;lasting immune memory in orthotopic GBM models.








Abstract
Peptide vaccines hold great promise for treatment of glioblastoma (GBM), though their efficacy remains suboptimal due to factors such as immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, poor accessibility to tumor site and inadequate activation of antigen&#8208;presenting cells. Here, this work reports on survivin peptide&#8208;CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) nanovaccines (SPOD&#8208;NV), which feature antigen peptides strategically displayed on polymersomes with CpG ODN encapsulated as an immunostimulatory adjuvant. Sequential administration via intranasal and intravenous routes elicits robust immune response against murine GBM. These results demonstrate that SPOD&#8208;NV significantly enhances mucosa penetration and markedly improves dendritic cell uptake and activation. Notably, the intranasal administration of SPOD&#8208;NV to orthotopic murine GL261 tumor models reveals marked accumulation in cervical lymph nodes and tumors, likely facilitated by lymphatic transport from nasal mucosa and pathways via olfactory bulb and trigeminal nerve, bypassing the blood&#8208;brain barrier. Interestingly, the therapeutic strategy, comprising three intranasal and two intravenous administrations of SPOD&#8208;NV in combination with anti&#8208;CTLA&#8208;4 antibody, results in substantial tumor inhibition, achieving a 43% complete regression rate, in line with the stimulation of robust and long&#8208;lasting local and systemic anti&#8208;GBM immune responses. These intranasal&#8208;intravenous administration strategy of peptide&#8208;CpG nanovaccines provides a potential curative therapy for brain tumors, paving the way for further developments in GBM immunotherapy.

Facile structural transformation&#8208;induced in situ core&#8208;shell self&#8208;assembly for constructing mono&#8208;dispersed aqueous colloidal perovskite nanocrystals, exhibiting unprecedented aqueous solution single photon emission.








Abstract
Aqueous solutions of nanoparticles are the cornerstones for applications in diagnostics, catalysis and more, where control over the nanoparticle's dispersion is pivotal to tailoring the final product properties. Of late, halide perovskite nanocrystals (HPNCs) with outstanding optoelectronic properties emerge as a class of semiconductor nanocrystals distinct from the incumbents. However, HPNCs are particularly susceptible to moisture induced degradation, limiting their utility and regulation in aqueous environments. Here, this hurdle is overcome to realize stable, mono&#8208;disperse, highly emissive HPNCs in aqueous environments even under ultra&#8208;dilute conditions. These colloidal HPNCs are synthesized via a facile room&#8208;temperature structural transformation&#8208;induced&#160;in situ&#160;core&#8208;shell self&#8208;assembly mechanism in contrast to the widely used pre&#8208;core&#8208;shell approach. The green HPNCs exhibit &gt;80% photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) with excellent water dispersion stability (i.e., zeta potential &gt;80 mV) even after &gt;10,000 h in water. Unprecedented aqueous solution phase single&#8208;photon emission with&#160;g(2)(0) &lt;0.2 at concentrations as low as &#8776;0.1 nM is measured. These aqueous HPNCs offer full color tunability&#160;that covers the entire Rec. 2020 standard. These findings will lay the foundation for innovative applications of HPNCs in aqueous environments, unlocking new opportunities for nanoscale sensing and optofluidics in photonics, environmental science, and materials engineering.

         <title>Dopamine Dopes the Performance of Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) is introduced of dopamine hydrochloride (DACl) on the SnO2 film, whose catechol moiety adheres strongly to the SnO2 surface, while its methylammonium groups template the growth of the perovskite layer. The DACl SAM enhances interfacial contact, boosts power conversion efficiency, promotes uniform film formation, reduces defects, and enhances the long&#8208;term performance of perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
The electron transport layer (ETL) is a crucial component of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) as it greatly influences their photovoltaic performance. Among various currently used ETL materials, SnO&#8322; stands out due to its unique advantages, including low&#8208;temperature fabrication and rapid electron extraction capability and excellent energy match of its conduction band edge with that of the commonly used perovskite formulations. However, the currently employed SnO&#8322; layers contain surface defects, such as hydroxyl groups and oxygen vacancies that impair the desired growth of highly crystalline and defect less perovskite films during solution processing of n&#8208;i&#8208;p type PSCs reducing their power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability. Here, a self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) is introduced of dopamine hydrochloride (DACl) on the SnO2 film, whose catechol moiety adheres strongly to the SnO2 surface, while its methylammonium groups template the growth of the perovskite layer. Introducing the dopamine SAM at the interface between the ETL and the perovskite increases substantially the solar&#8208;to&#8208;electric PCE while greatly enhancing the PSC stability. This findings demonstrate the surprising benefits of this well&#8208;known neurotransmitter for the photovoltaic performance of PSCs which this is rationalized here by DFT and ab initio molecular dynamics calculations.

         <title>Dual Strategy of Ca2+ Influx and Collagen Denaturation to Remodel the Extracellular Matrix and Amplify Sonopiezoelectric Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The narrow bandgap of noncentrosymmetric Cu3BiS3 nanospheres facilitates charge&#8208;carrier separation under ultrasound irradiation, resulting in a favorable sonopiezoelectric response and reactive oxygen generation. External stimulation causes mitochondrial dysfunction and amplifies cellular oxidative damage. Ca2+ influx and collagen denaturation induced by the piezoelectric signal and photothermal effect facilitated extracellular matrix remodeling.








Abstract
Extracellular matrix (ECM), a core member of tumor microenvironment, is &#8776;1.5&#8208;fold harder than the surrounding normal tissues. Regulating the stiffness of ECM can significantly impact physiological activities of tumor cells, such as growth, differentiation, and migration. Herein, a sonopiezoelectric&#8208;response nanoplatform consisting of Cu3BiS3 nanospheres (CBS NSs) is constructed for ECM remodeling. Sonopiezoelectric therapy (SPT) and chemodynamic therapy (CDT) are conducted using ultrasound (US) and near&#8208;infrared irradiation. Under US irradiation, the mechanical strain of CBS NSs causes piezoelectric polarization and promotes a redox reaction through energy band bending. The built&#8208;in electric field generated by US irradiation amplifies the efficiency of the Fenton&#8208;like reaction and substantially enhances reactive oxygen species production. Moreover, piezoelectric property&#8208;mediated electrical signals can allow Ca2+ influx, upregulating the levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)&#8208;2 and MMP&#8208;9. Integrating US irradiation with near&#8208;infrared irradiation generates localized heat, which can effectively denature tumor collagen, reduce tumor stiffness, and enhance the permeability of CBS NSs into solid tumors, thus improving the SPT effect. The combination of MMP upregulation and collagen degradation can maximize the benefits of ECM remodeling and synergistically enhance the cancer therapeutic efficacy of SPT/CDT. This SPT/CDT synergistic therapy and ECM remodeling platform is an innovative strategy for cancer therapy.

&lt;p&gt;The narrow bandgap of noncentrosymmetric Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;BiS&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanospheres facilitates charge-carrier separation under ultrasound irradiation, resulting in a favorable sonopiezoelectric response and reactive oxygen generation. External stimulation causes mitochondrial dysfunction and amplifies cellular oxidative damage. Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx and collagen denaturation induced by the piezoelectric signal and photothermal effect facilitated extracellular matrix remodeling.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extracellular matrix (ECM), a core member of tumor microenvironment, is &#8776;1.5-fold harder than the surrounding normal tissues. Regulating the stiffness of ECM can significantly impact physiological activities of tumor cells, such as growth, differentiation, and migration. Herein, a sonopiezoelectric-response nanoplatform consisting of Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;BiS&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanospheres (CBS NSs) is constructed for ECM remodeling. Sonopiezoelectric therapy (SPT) and chemodynamic therapy (CDT) are conducted using ultrasound (US) and near-infrared irradiation. Under US irradiation, the mechanical strain of CBS NSs causes piezoelectric polarization and promotes a redox reaction through energy band bending. The built-in electric field generated by US irradiation amplifies the efficiency of the Fenton-like reaction and substantially enhances reactive oxygen species production. Moreover, piezoelectric property-mediated electrical signals can allow Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx, upregulating the levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9. Integrating US irradiation with near-infrared irradiation generates localized heat, which can effectively denature tumor collagen, reduce tumor stiffness, and enhance the permeability of CBS NSs into solid tumors, thus improving the SPT effect. The combination of MMP upregulation and collagen degradation can maximize the benefits of ECM remodeling and synergistically enhance the cancer therapeutic efficacy of SPT/CDT. This SPT/CDT synergistic therapy and ECM remodeling platform is an innovative strategy for cancer therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Revealing the Underlying Role of Li2CO3 in Enhancing Performance of Oxyhalide&#8208;Based Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) with oxyhalide electrolytes benefit from residual lithium compounds (RLCs) like Li&#8322;CO&#8323;, which enhance lithium ion mobility and interfacial dynamics. This study reveals untreated Ni&#8208;rich cathodes outperform washed ones, challenging conventional views of RLCs and offering insights to improve ASSB performance.









Abstract
Residual lithium compounds (RLCs) in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) employing Ni&#8208;rich cathode materials (LiNixCoyMnzO2, NCM) are traditionally viewed either as ionically and electronically insulating layers hindering electrochemical performance or as protective buffer layers enhancing cycling stability. In this study, a beneficial role of Li2CO3 in ASSBs featuring an oxyhalide&#8208;based AlOCl&#8208;2LiCl (LAOC) solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) is revealed. ASSBs containing NCM with residual Li2CO3 demonstrate superior electrochemical performance compared to those treated with a washing pretreatment to remove Li2CO3. Solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) spectroscopy shows that Li2CO3 facilitates spontaneous Li+ exchange at multiple sites within the LAOC SSE. This leads to faster ion mobility and shorter relaxation times at various lithium sites, indicating enhanced ion transport and improved interface dynamics. Moreover, the beneficial effects of Li2CO3 are confirmed in other halide&#8208;based ASSBs. This study uncovers an unexpected role for Li2CO3 in halide&#8208;based ASSBs, offering insights that may inspire further exploration of RLCs with functional properties for improving ASSBs performance.

         <title>Stretchable, Multiplexed, and Bimodal Sensing Electronic Armor for Colonoscopic Continuum Robot Enhanced by Triboelectric Artificial Synapse</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Colonoscopic continuum robots lack sensing, endangering intestinal tissue. An ideal sensing array is hard to integrate. This work introduces a 3D crosslinked stretchable E&#8208;armor with full&#8208;coverage and multiplexing. It has bimodal sensing, forms a triboelectric synapse, uses CNN&#8208;LSTM, and has a hydrogel and innovative triboelectric materials. A control strategy and digital twin interface enhance safety and interaction in colonoscopy.








Abstract
Colonoscopic continuum robots often lack sensing capabilities, risking tissue damage. An ideal robot electronic skin should offer full&#8208;body coverage, multiplexing, stretchability, and multifunctionality, but integration is challenging due to the robot's elongated structure. This work presents a stretchable electronic armor (E&#8208;armor) with a 3D crosslinked structure that enables 300&#160;mm full coverage while accomplishing multiplexed simultaneous tactile and strain sensing through bioinspired artificial synapse mechanisms. The E&#8208;armor integrates 48 tactile sensing points through bilayer co&#8208;electrode strategy, reducing wiring while combining triboelectric encoding intelligence with innovative stretchable triboelectric interlinked films (TIFs) to form a triboelectric artificial synapse that generates digitally encoded signal pairs upon contact. A convolutional neural network and long short&#8208;term memory network (CNN&#8208;LSTM) deep learning framework achieve 99.31% accuracy in identifying multi&#8208;point tactile signals. A sodium alginate/polyacrylamide/sodium chloride (SA/PAM/NaCl) conductive hydrogel serves as a strain sensing element, providing excellent stretchability and biocompatibility, and allowing precise inference of bending angles at 12 strain sensing edges. A compliance control strategy coordinates tactile and strain signals to autonomously adjust continuum robot postures while ensuring smooth operation. The digital twin&#8208;based 3D visualization interface enhances human&#8211;robot interaction by digitally reconstructing both tactile and strain feedback, enabling real&#8208;time visualization of the continuum robot's intracolonic posture.

The atomic&#8208;level high&#8208;entropy nanozyme system is successfully constructed, which can remarkably endogenous targeted catalysis and enhance tumor photothermal therapy. The synthesized snHEAzyme@DSPE&#8208;PEG2000&#8208;cRGD@Cy7 system exhibits excellent peroxidase&#8208;like activity and high absorbance in the near&#8208;infrared range. In vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrated that the snHEAzyme@DSPE&#8208;PEG2000&#8208;cRGD@Cy7 system can be effectively targeted to penetrate tumor cell membranes and treat tumors.








Abstract
Nanozymes hold great potential in protecting human health. However, constructing new and efficient nanozymes is a significant challenge. Developing atomic&#8208;level nanozymes is a promising approach. Despite their potential, atomic&#8208;level high&#8208;entropy nanozymes have not been reported due to thermodynamic instability. Therefore, developing atomic&#8208;level high&#8208;entropy nanozymes are of great significance. What's more, further exploring their biomedical applications can open up new horizons for nanozymology. Here, the atomic&#8208;level high&#8208;entropy nanozyme system capable of remarkable endogenous targeted catalysis and enhancing tumor photothermal therapy is successfully constructed. The system is prepared by reduction&#8208;diffusion and grafting methods. The RuRhPtIrMo sub&#8208;nanometer high&#8208;entropy nanozyme (snHEAzyme) with about 8&#8211;10 atoms thickness is first prepared. Then, they are grafted by targeting agent DSPE&#8208;PEG2000&#8208;cRGD and imaging agent Cy7 to obtain the snHEAzyme@DSPE&#8208;PEG2000&#8208;cRGD@Cy7 nanozyme system. The synthesized snHEAzyme@DSPE&#8208;PEG2000&#8208;cRGD@Cy7 system exhibits excellent peroxidase&#8208;like activity and high absorbance in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) range. Under NIR irradiation, the nanozyme shows efficient photothermal conversion and reactive oxygen species generation effects. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that the snHEAzyme@DSPE&#8208;PEG2000&#8208;cRGD@Cy7 system can be effectively targeted to penetrate tumor cell membranes and treat tumors. This work offers a new perspective on snHEAzyme fabrication and its biomedical applications.

         <title>Bismuthene Under Cover: Graphene Intercalation of a Large Gap Quantum Spin Hall Insulator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bismuthene, a quantum spin Hall insulator with a massive 800 meV topological gap, holds great potential for room&#8208;temperature devices but rapidly degrades in air. This study demonstrates that intercalating bismuthene between SiC and a graphene sheet preserves its structure and topology while preventing oxidation, enabling ex&#8208;situ experiments and advancing the fabrication of bismuthene&#8208;based devices.








Abstract
The quantum spin Hall insulator bismuthene, a two&#8208;third monolayer of bismuth on SiC(0001), is distinguished by helical metallic edge states that are protected by a groundbreaking 800 meV topological gap, making it ideal for room temperature applications. This massive gap inversion arises from a unique synergy between flat honeycomb structure, strong spin orbit coupling, and an orbital filtering effect that is mediated by the substrate. However, the rapid oxidation of bismuthene in air has severely hindered the development of applications, so far confining experiments to ultra&#8208;high vacuum conditions. Intercalating bismuthene between SiC and a protective sheet of graphene, this barrier is successfully overcome. As demonstrated by scanning tunneling microscopy and photoemission spectroscopy, graphene intercalation preserves the structural and topological integrity of bismuthene, while effectively shielding it from oxidation in air. Hereby, hydrogen is identified as the critical process gas that was&#160;missing in previous bismuth intercalation attempts. These findings facilitate ex&#8208;situ experiments and pave the way for the development of bismuthene based devices, signaling a significant step forward in the development of next&#8208;generation&#160;technologies.

     alt="Bismuthene Under Cover: Graphene Intercalation of a Large Gap Quantum Spin Hall Insulator"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bismuthene, a quantum spin Hall insulator with a massive 800 meV topological gap, holds great potential for room-temperature devices but rapidly degrades in air. This study demonstrates that intercalating bismuthene between SiC and a graphene sheet preserves its structure and topology while preventing oxidation, enabling ex-situ experiments and advancing the fabrication of bismuthene-based devices.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quantum spin Hall insulator bismuthene, a two-third monolayer of bismuth on SiC(0001), is distinguished by helical metallic edge states that are protected by a groundbreaking 800 meV topological gap, making it ideal for room temperature applications. This massive gap inversion arises from a unique synergy between flat honeycomb structure, strong spin orbit coupling, and an orbital filtering effect that is mediated by the substrate. However, the rapid oxidation of bismuthene in air has severely hindered the development of applications, so far confining experiments to ultra-high vacuum conditions. Intercalating bismuthene between SiC and a protective sheet of graphene, this barrier is successfully overcome. As demonstrated by scanning tunneling microscopy and photoemission spectroscopy, graphene intercalation preserves the structural and topological integrity of bismuthene, while effectively shielding it from oxidation in air. Hereby, hydrogen is identified as the critical process gas that was&#160;missing in previous bismuth intercalation attempts. These findings facilitate ex-situ experiments and pave the way for the development of bismuthene based devices, signaling a significant step forward in the development of next-generation&#160;technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>3D Printing of Auxetic Self&#8208;powered Mechanoluminescent Photonic Skins for Underwater Communication and Safety Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D&#8208;printed self&#8208;powered auxetic mechanoluminescent photonic skin for underwater communication and safety monitoring is introduced. Its auxetic structures, with a negative Poisson's ratio, ensure exceptional conformability to curved surfaces, enhancing adaptability to dynamic underwater environments. Encapsulated in silicone, it offers outstanding stretchability, brightness, and durability even in harsh conditions, enabling reliable deep&#8208;sea exploration.








Abstract
Stretchable mechanoluminescent (ML) photonic skin with strong and stable brightness holds great promise for underwater communication and safety monitoring. However, traditional film&#8208;based ML devices often lack the compliance needed to accommodate curved surfaces and face a trade&#8208;off between extensibility and luminescent intensity. This study introduces a 3D&#8208;printed self&#8208;powered auxetic ML photonic skin. By utilizing auxetic materials with a negative Poisson's ratio, we created a stretchable ML device that conforms to complex, curved surfaces, enhancing its applicability in dynamic underwater settings. By encapsulating the auxetic ML structure in silicone, simultaneous improvements in brightness uniformity and stretchability are achieved. The device exhibits remarkable durability, maintaining consistent light emission and mechanical performance over 10&#8201;000 cycles, and demonstrates the potential for real&#8208;time underwater communication and safety monitoring. Integrated into a glove, a swimming toy, and a gas tank, the photonic skin successfully transmitted Morse code signals and detected gas leaks, showcasing its versatility and robustness in harsh underwater conditions. These findings underscore the potential of this technology to improve safety and efficiency in marine exploration, paving the way for further advancements in underwater robotics and communication.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Sn on Core&#8208;Shell MoS2 Nanoreactors as Mott&#8208;Schottky Phase Junctions for Efficient Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>

         <dc:description>
A hollow core&#8208;shell structured Mott&#8208;Schottky phase junction 2H@1T&#8208;MoS2&#8208;Sn1 nanoreactor with a definite Sn&#8208;S2&#8208;Mo motif is designed, which exhibits a record overpotential of 9&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The 2H@1T&#8208;MoS2 Mott&#8208;Schottky phase junction promotes charge transfer, while the surface Sn single atom facilitates the reduction of adsorbed H&#8314;, thus accelerating the catalytic performance.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) plays a pivotal role in electrochemical energy conversion and storage. However, traditional HER catalysts still face significant challenges, including limited activity, poor acid resistance, and high costs. To address these issues, a hollow core&#8208;shell structured 2H@1T&#8208;MoS2&#8208;Sn1 nanoreactor is designed for acidic HER, where Sn single atoms are anchored on the shell of 2H@1T&#8208;MoS2 Mott&#8208;Schottky phase junction. The 2H@1T&#8208;MoS2&#8208;Sn1 catalyst demonstrates exceptional HER performance, achieving an ultralow overpotential of 9&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a Tafel slope of 16.3&#160;mV dec&#8722;1 in acidic media&#8212;the best performance reported to date among MoS2&#8208;based electrocatalysts. The enhanced performance is attributed to the internal electric field at the Mott&#8208;Schottky phase junction, which facilitates efficient electron transfer. Additionally, the Sn single atoms modulate the electronic structure of Mo atoms within the Sn&#8208;S2&#8208;Mo motif, inducing a significant shift in the d&#8208;band center and thereby optimizing the dehydrogenation process. This work presents a novel electrocatalyst design strategy that simultaneously engineers interfacial charge transfer and surface catalysis, offering a promising approach for advancing energy conversion technologies.

         <title>Directionally Modulated Zinc Deposition by a Robust Zincophilic Cu&#8208;Phthalocyanine Protective Layer in Dendrite&#8208;Free Aqueous Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefiting from the precisely anchored zincophilic sites, the ample transport channels with rich redox active sites, and the suppressed hydrogen evolution by the copper (Cu) sites, a highly conjugated robust Cu&#8208;Phthalocyanine covalent organic framework layer is designed and applied for directional modulation of zinc (Zn) ions and dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition in aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
The directional modulation of zinc (Zn) deposition with further investigation of the dendrite&#8208;formation mechanism is vital in artificial anode protective layer for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). Herein, a robust metalated covalent organic framework (CuPc&#8208;COF) used as the artificial anode protective layer is proposed, in which the zincophilic sites of &#960;&#8208;conjugated periodic skeletons are precisely designed to modulate the directional migration of Zn2+, the multiple redox&#8208;active sites facilitate the Zn2+ confinement and transfer, and the central metal copper (Cu)&#160;serves as the inhibitor to eliminate the hydrogen evolution side reactions. By combining theoretical calculations with experiments, the &#960;&#8208;conjugated planar CuPc&#8208;COF layer is a desired protective coating of AZIB anodes with directionally transport channels and abundant redox active sites, thus inducing two&#8208;dimensional deposition of Zn. Attributed to these superiorities, the fabricated CuPc&#8208;COF@Zn anode demonstrates excellent cycling lifespan in both symmetrical cell (exceeding 2500&#160;h at 1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2) and full cell with different cathodes (more than 3000 cycles at 1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1), outperforming most reported zinc anodes with COF&#8208;based layers.

         <title>Neuroblastoma&#8208;Targeting &#960;&#8208;Conjugated COP Nanostructure with Multiple Enzyme&#8208;Mimetic Actions for Sonochemodynamic Immunotherapies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An imide&#8208;linked metal&#8208;phthalocyanine&#8208;based conjugated organic polymer (COP) (COPTPcFe) with a well&#8208;defined &#960;&#8208;conjugated nanostructure and peroxidase&#8208;mimetic atomic Fe&#8208;N sites for sonochemodynamic immunotherapy against neuroblastoma. The COPTPcFe can efficiently produce potent ROS (&#8226;OH and &#8226;O2&#8722;) by utilizing localized H2O2 and the effects of ultrasound, thereby achieving efficient and synergistic tumoricidal activity.








Abstract
Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) has emerged as a promising strategy for neuroblastoma treatment, leveraging ultrasound to induce the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) at tumor sites, thereby enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapy. However, a major challenge in SDT is the efficiency of ROS generation, particularly in the context of hypoxia within the tumor microenvironment. Herein, inspired by the natural peroxidase, an imide&#8208;linked metal&#8208;phthalocyanine&#8208;based conjugated organic polymer (COP) (COPTPcFe) has been designed with a well&#8208;defined &#960;&#8208;conjugated nanostructure and peroxidase&#8208;mimetic atomic Fe&#8208;N sites for sonochemodynamic immunotherapy against neuroblastoma. This work demonstrates that COPTPcFe can efficiently produce potent ROS (&#8226;OH and &#8226;O2&#8722;) by utilizing localized H2O2 and the effects of ultrasound, thereby achieving efficient and synergistic tumoricidal activity. Notably, the highly &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure endows COPTPcFe with excellent electron transport capabilities, enabling rapid catalysis of H2O2 to O2, thus alleviating the hypoxic conditions within tumors. Moreover, by encapsulating COPTPcFe with neuroblastoma cell membranes, this study achieveshomologous targeting of tumor cells and tissues, leading to efficient accumulation within tumor cells, mitochondrial disruption, and apoptosis. Additionally, the proposed sonochemodynamic immunotherapy effectively activates natural killer cells and reverses the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, thereby alleviating hypoxia and significantly enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of neuroblastoma treatment.

&lt;p&gt;Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) has emerged as a promising strategy for neuroblastoma treatment, leveraging ultrasound to induce the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) at tumor sites, thereby enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapy. However, a major challenge in SDT is the efficiency of ROS generation, particularly in the context of hypoxia within the tumor microenvironment. Herein, inspired by the natural peroxidase, an imide-linked metal-phthalocyanine-based conjugated organic polymer (COP) (COP&lt;sub&gt;TPcFe&lt;/sub&gt;) has been designed with a well-defined &#960;-conjugated nanostructure and peroxidase-mimetic atomic Fe-N sites for sonochemodynamic immunotherapy against neuroblastoma. This work demonstrates that COP&lt;sub&gt;TPcFe&lt;/sub&gt; can efficiently produce potent ROS (&#8226;OH and &#8226;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) by utilizing localized H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the effects of ultrasound, thereby achieving efficient and synergistic tumoricidal activity. Notably, the highly &#960;-conjugated structure endows COP&lt;sub&gt;TPcFe&lt;/sub&gt; with excellent electron transport capabilities, enabling rapid catalysis of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, thus alleviating the hypoxic conditions within tumors. Moreover, by encapsulating COP&lt;sub&gt;TPcFe&lt;/sub&gt; with neuroblastoma cell membranes, this study achieveshomologous targeting of tumor cells and tissues, leading to efficient accumulation within tumor cells, mitochondrial disruption, and apoptosis. Additionally, the proposed sonochemodynamic immunotherapy effectively activates natural killer cells and reverses the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, thereby alleviating hypoxia and significantly enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of neuroblastoma treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Green Solvent&#8208;Processed Organic Solar Cells Approaching 20.4% Efficiency via Active Layer Pre&#8208;Solidification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique active layer pre&#8208;solidification strategy is proposed to suppress the excessive molecular aggregation and phase separation, which effectively mitigates the efficiency drops caused by various green solvents, demonstrating the excellent universality. Additionally, by suppressing the coffee&#8208;ring effect, the rigid and flexible OSC modules achieve record&#8208;breaking PCEs of 17.06% and 12.45%, respectively, exhibiting the excellent scalability.








Abstract
Green solvent fabrication of efficient organic solar cells (OSCs) is essential for their industrial scale extension and ecological sustainability, but there is typically an obvious efficiency drop during the transition from halogenated to green solvents due to the severe molecular aggregation. Here, an innovative strategy of active layer pre&#8208;solidification by liquid nitrogen freezing process is proposed to accelerate molecular precipitation and crystallization, and therefore suppress the excessive phase separation, as demonstrated by PiFM and GISAXs results. Moreover, pre&#8208;solidification process allows more solvents to carry acceptor molecules for an orderly upward migration during rapid volatilization, facilitating an ideal longitudinal gradient arrangement of photovoltaic materials that is favorable for charge transport and extraction. Consequently, PM6:L8BO&#8208;X:BO&#8208;8F OSCs fabricate with o&#8208;xylene yielded a record efficiency of 20.38%, which is comparable to 20.56% for chloroform&#8208;processed devices. The inconspicuous efficiency gaps are observed in various photovoltaic materials by using green solvents, proving the outstanding universality. In addition, the pre&#8208;solidification process effectively inhibits the coffee&#8208;ring effect in large&#8208;area active layer films and boosts the OSC modules to an exciting 17.06% efficiency. This work virtually eliminates the photovoltaic performance losses caused by green solvents, and charts a sustainable avenue to large&#8208;scale commercialization of organic photovoltaics.

         <title>Amorphous Phosphates Tailor Local Proton Supply for Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A balanced proton supply improves electrochemical hydrogen evolution performance without causing proton aggregation or electron wastage. This is made by a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept electrode design, where the key feature is a multi&#8208;role proton&#8208;managing amorphous phosphate species that facilitates active hydrogen/proton generation, buffers excess protons without local pile&#8208;up, and transfers protons to H&#8208;consuming CoP rapidly.








Abstract
Hydrogen (H2) is irreplaceable as a feedstock in varied industrial scenarios, and alkaline water electrolysis allows for H2 production without costly proton exchange membrane and noble metals with limited reserves. However, alkaline solution is devoid of directly available protons, leading to suboptimal electrochemical H2&#8208;evolving kinetics even on catalysts with high intrinsic activities like CoP. On the other hand, high local acidity (i.e., superfluous protons) can lead to undesirable catalyst corrosion and active site blocking by excessive hydrogen coverage. Herein, a &#8220;cobalt phosphate&#8208;clothed&#8208;CoP (CoPi@CoP)&#8221; nanoarray catalyst is developed for proof of concept to explore a possible proton supply design principle. The nanometer&#8208;thick amorphous CoPi appears to serve multiple functions: facilitating water dissociation/H&#8211;O cleavage, buffering excess protons, and accelerating proton transfer/donation, thus optimizing the local proton supply to H&#8208;consuming sites. As expected, CoPi@CoP demonstrates state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art hydrogen evolution reaction performance in alkaline electrolytes, surpassing that of intrinsically active CoP. Online differential mass spectrometry, dynamic potential decay transients, spectroscopy data, and theoretical calculations reveal possible (atomic scale) reaction mechanisms.

         <title>Intensive Widmannst&#228;tten Nanoprecipitates Catalyze SnTe With State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;Art Thermoelectric Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intensive lath&#8208;shaped Ag2Te Widmannst&#228;tten nanoprecipitates are in situ generated in SnTe via AgPbSbTe3 alloying, and align with the formation of the parallel type and twin type interfaces. These Widmannst&#228;tten nanoprecipitates effectively scatter phonons to reduce the lattice thermal conductivity, resulting in a significantly enhanced average ZT, more suitable for mid&#8208;temperature applications.








Abstract
Nanoprecipitates play a vital role in designing high&#8208;performance thermoelectric materials, particularly for those with short phonon mean&#8208;free paths. However, their effectiveness in reducing lattice thermal conductivity is hindered by the uncontrollable intensity, poor interfacial coherence, and suboptimal morphology. To address these limitations, AgPbSbTe3 is used to alloy SnTe to form intensive Ag2Te Widmannst&#228;tten nanoprecipitates for obtaining state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art thermoelectric performance. Advanced microscopy characterizations reveal the crystallographic orientation relationships between SnTe and Ag2Te to guide the lath&#8208;shaped morphology of Ag2Te, leading to the formation of the high&#8208;intensity Widmannst&#228;tten nanoprecipitates, which effectively scatter phonons to reduce the lattice thermal conductivity. Togethering the optimized electrical properties through carrier concentration adjustment, band convergence, and the energy filtering effect, a maximum figure of merit ZT of 1.5 at 723 K and an average ZT of 1.1 between 423 and 823 K is achieved in (SnTe)0.80(Ag1.05PbSb0.95Te3)0.20, enabling a single&#8208;leg device and two&#8208;pair module with energy&#8208;conversion efficiency of 7.22% and 4.26% under a temperature difference of 450 K, respectively. The findings highlight the potential of intensive Widmannst&#228;tten nanoprecipitates as effective phonon scattering centers, providing a new pathway to enhance the thermoelectric performance of chalcogenides.

         <title>Universal Ion Migration Suppression Strategy Based on Supramolecular Host&#8211;Guest Interaction for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiple functional layers are stabilized by the simultaneous suppression of the migration of multiple mobile chemical species based on host&#8211;guest interaction via calixarene supramolecules (C8A). The C8A&#8208;doped regular devices based on the two&#8208;step perovskite deposition method achieve a PCE of 26.01% (certified 25.68%). The C8A&#8208;modified p&#8208;i&#8208;n inverted PSCs obtain a champion PCE of 27.18% (certified 26.79%). The resulting unsealed inverted device retains 95% of its initial PCE after 1015 h of continuous operation at maximum power point.








Abstract
The migration of multiple chemical species is are main factor leading to the intrinsic instability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, a universal ion migration suppression strategy is innovatively reported to stabilize multiple functional layers by simultaneously suppressing the migration of multiple mobile chemical species based on host&#8211;guest interaction via calixarene supramolecules. After incorporating 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylcalix[8]arene (C8A), the interfacial defects are passivated, suppressing trap&#8208;assisted nonradiative recombination. Moreover, the p&#8208;doping of Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD is facilitated, and the extraction and transport of holes are promoted for n&#8208;i&#8208;p regular PSCs. The C8A doped regular devices based on the two&#8208;step perovskite deposition method achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.01% (certified 25.68%), which is the record PCE ever reported for the TiO2&#8208;based planar PSCs. The C8A passivated p&#8208;i&#8208;n inverted PSCs obtain a champion PCE of 27.18% (certified 26.79%), which is the highest PCE for the PSCs using the vacuum flash evaporation method. The resulting unsealed inverted device retains 95% of its initial PCE after 1015&#160;h of continuous operation at maximum power point. This work provides a feasible and effective avenue to address the intrinsic instability of perovskite&#8208;based photovoltaics and other optoelectronic devices.

The resulting unsealed inverted device retains 95% of its initial PCE after 1015 h of continuous operation at maximum power point.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The migration of multiple chemical species is are main factor leading to the intrinsic instability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, a universal ion migration suppression strategy is innovatively reported to stabilize multiple functional layers by simultaneously suppressing the migration of multiple mobile chemical species based on host&#8211;guest interaction via calixarene supramolecules. After incorporating 4-tert-butylcalix[8]arene (C8A), the interfacial defects are passivated, suppressing trap-assisted nonradiative recombination. Moreover, the p-doping of Spiro-OMeTAD is facilitated, and the extraction and transport of holes are promoted for n-i-p regular PSCs. The C8A doped regular devices based on the two-step perovskite deposition method achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.01% (certified 25.68%), which is the record PCE ever reported for the TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based planar PSCs. The C8A passivated p-i-n inverted PSCs obtain a champion PCE of 27.18% (certified 26.79%), which is the highest PCE for the PSCs using the vacuum flash evaporation method. The resulting unsealed inverted device retains 95% of its initial PCE after 1015&#160;h of continuous operation at maximum power point. This work provides a feasible and effective avenue to address the intrinsic instability of perovskite-based photovoltaics and other optoelectronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Suppressing Interlayer Ion Migration in CsPbX3 Nanocrystal Films for Realizing Efficient and Stable Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A clear CsPbBr3&#8208;CsPbI3 nanocrystal film interface is fabricated through transfer printing to decouple the influence of ion migration inside a single nanocrystal or across nanocrystals along the electric field on the performance of PeLEDs. Halogen ions crossing the nanocrystal film interface cause phase separation and poor device stability, while confined halogen ions in a single nanocrystal negligibly influence the spectral stability.








Abstract
Mixed&#8208;halide perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) face the critical challenge of field&#8208;dependent phase separation. Discrete colloidal CsPbX3 nanocrystals anchored with ligands are promising to suppress phase separation, yet it remains a mystery how ion migration proceeds when integrated into LEDs as emissive films. Specifically, the influence of ion migration inside a single nanocrystal or across the nanocrystals along the electric field on the performance of PeLEDs needs to be decoupled. Here, a low&#8208;temperature&#8208;assisted transfer&#8208;printing method is developed to construct a model PeLED containing a clear CsPbBr3&#8208;CsPbI3 nanocrystal film interface for tracing the ion migration between perovskite nanocrystal films along the direction of electric fields. The comprehensive study demonstrates that halogen ions crossing the nanocrystal film interface lead to severe phase separation and poor device stability, rather than the horizontal intra&#8208;layer diffusion. The monolayer CsPbX3 nanocrystal film prevents the field&#8208;dependent phase separation caused by interlayer ion migration, significantly improving electroluminescent stability, including spectrum and lifetime. The optimized structure achieves a high external quantum efficiency of 26.9% and a remarkably improved operational half&#8208;lifetime of 61.2 h at an initial luminance of 100 cd m&#8722;2 in pure&#8208;red PeLEDs based on mixed&#8208;halide CsPb(Ix/Br1&#8208;x)3, more than 300 times longer than the control device using multilayer nanocrystals.

         <title>Kg&#8208;Scale Synthesis of Ultrathin Single&#8208;Crystalline MOF/GO/MOF Sandwich Nanosheets with Elevated Electrochemical Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a scalable method for synthesizing ultrathin single&#8208;crystalline MOF/GO/MOF (MGM) sandwich nanosheets, utilizing graphene oxide (GO) as a structure&#8208;directing agent. The approach achieves kilogram&#8208;scale production with a 98.73% metal&#8208;based yield and demonstrates universality across various ligands. The optimized nanosheets exhibit superior electrochemical performance in aqueous basic zinc batteries, sodium&#8208;ion batteries, and oxygen evolution reactions.








Abstract
The scalable preparation of 2D ultrathin metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanosheets remains a significant challenge due to low stripping efficiency and susceptibility to agglomeration. Herein, a facile strategy is developed for the synthesis of 2D ultrathin single&#8208;crystal MOF/graphene oxide (GO)/MOF (MGM) sandwich&#8208;like nanosheets based on the Ni/Co&#8208;BDC MOF (BDC = 1,4&#8208;terephthalic acid), with GO serving as a structure&#8208;directing agent. Impressively, 1&#160;kg of MGM nanosheets can be obtained in a single batch with a metal&#8208;based yield of 98.73%. Furthermore, the universality of this strategy is implemented by the successful synthesis of three additional 2D ultrathin nanosheets: MGM7&#8208;ABDC, MGM7&#8208;FBDC, and MGM7&#8208;BPDC (metal = Ni, Co; ligands = 2&#8208;aminoterephthalic acid (2&#8208;ABDC), 2&#8208;fluoroterephthalic acid (2&#8208;FBDC), and 4,4&#8242;&#8208; biphenyl dicarboxylic acid (BPDC)). The as&#8208;prepared MGM7 nanosheets (Ni: Co ratio = 7:3) exhibit excellent electrochemical performance as the cathode for aqueous basic zinc battery (159.2&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1), anode for sodium&#8208;ion battery (SIB, 593.0&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 0.2 A g&#8722;1), and electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER, 224&#160;mV overpotential at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2), significantly outperforming both bulk MOFs and conventional MOF nanosheets. This work enables the scalable synthesis of 2D MOF nanosheets with enhanced properties for multiple applications.

         <title>Finding a Novel Borate Ferroelectric with Random Domain Structures for Deep&#8208;UV Quasi&#8208;Phase&#8208;Matching</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a new room&#8208;temperature borate ferroelectric material, Ba&#8323;Mg&#8323;(BO&#8323;)&#8323;F&#8323; (BMBF) is presented, whose randomly distributed nanoscale domain structures could relax the strict phase&#8208;matching conditions. Benefiting from its unique ferroelectric properties, the BMBF crystal achieves 3.55 &#181;J output energy for 398 &#8594; 199 nm wavelength frequency conversion without requiring birefringent phase&#8208;matching conditions.








Abstract
Finding competitive nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals for practical deep&#8208;ultraviolet (deep&#8208;UV) lasers remains a fundamental yet challenging goal in photonic materials research. The production of deep&#8208;UV lasers through the mesoscopic domain structure of ferroelectric materials has been a popular research area via quasi&#8208;phase&#8208;matching (QPM). However, as of right present, no ferroelectric in the deep&#8208;UV area is able to provide QPM laser output. Here, a new room&#8208;temperature borate ferroelectric Ba3Mg3(BO3)3F3 (BMBF) is presented. The ferroelectricity of BMBF crystals exhibits significant relaxor behavior and the random domain structure can relax the strict phase&#8208;matching conditions, rendering it a disordered NLO medium. Benefiting from its unique ferroelectric properties, BMBF crystal achieves a second&#8208;harmonic generation output energy of 3.55 &#181;J for 398 to 199&#160;nm wavelength frequency conversion, even in the absence of birefringent phase&#8208;matching conditions. This result demonstrates that BMBF is a promising candidate for deep&#8208;UV QPM applications. Furthermore, this study expands the frontiers of borate ferroelectrics while the realization of deep&#8208;UV light output using BMBF crystal motivates and provides a path for its broader application.

         <dc:description>
This research proposes a novel in&#8208;memory photodetector based on wide bandgap semiconductor Ga2O3 by integrating memory characteristics into the detector. The device exhibits extraordinary memory characteristics and photodetection performance.

Abstract
The development of high&#8208;performance detectors has played a key role in the innovation of modern optoelectronics. However, the implementation of high&#8208;performance detectors has been a huge challenge, especially the present detectors with only optoelectronic conversion functions cannot satisfy the growing demands of the multifunction required in single devices. Here, it is demonstrated a novel in&#8208;memory photodetector based on wide bandgap semiconductor Ga2O3 by integrating memory characteristics into the detector.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of high-performance detectors has played a key role in the innovation of modern optoelectronics. However, the implementation of high-performance detectors has been a huge challenge, especially the present detectors with only optoelectronic conversion functions cannot satisfy the growing demands of the multifunction required in single devices. Here, it is demonstrated a novel in-memory photodetector based on wide bandgap semiconductor Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; by integrating memory characteristics into the detector. Originating from the dynamic control of the channel carriers by the interface charge reservoir under illumination and electrical, the device exhibits extraordinary memory characteristics and photodetection performance. The ultrahigh-speed programming/erasing operations in the range of nanoseconds with an extinction ratio up to 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; is achieved. Moreover, the in-memory photodetectors achieve near-zero dark current, record high responsivity (6.7 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; A&#160;W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), and sensitivity for UV light, making them the most sensitive UV photodetectors. Further, the potential of the device in weak-light imaging enhancement, light information storage, and light moving path recording in the passive mode is excavated for the first time. This work enables new device capabilities and opens new opportunities for the development of high-performance in-memory detectors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Assisted CVD Growth of High&#8208;Quality Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative oxygen&#8208;assisted strategy is proposed to in situ grow twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) with twist angles ranging from 0&#176; to 30&#176;. The fraction of tBLG with small twist angles (0&#176; &lt; &#120579; &#8804; 3&#176;) is significantly improved to 9.15%. The clear moir&#233; superlattice, ultrahigh Hall mobility exceeding 20&#8201;000 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, weak localization effect, and Shubnikov&#8208;de Haas oscillations corroborate the high&#8208;quality of tBLG.








Abstract
Twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) garners significant interest due to its unconventional superconductivity and correlated insulator behavior. However, challenges persist in preparing high&#8208;quality tBLG with clean interfaces and a broad range of twist angles. Herein, a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method is presented that utilizes an oxygen&#8208;assisted strategy to grow high&#8208;quality tBLG with twist angles ranging from 0&#176; to 30&#176;. The continuous and stable oxygen supply not only facilitates rapid graphene growth, but also overcomes the self&#8208;limiting growth of monolayer graphene on liquid Cu. Consequently, the growth rate of tBLG reaches a record of 450&#160;&#181;m&#160;h&#8722;1, with 86.9% of the tBLG grown with the assistance of the oxide substrate. The proportion of tBLG with small twist angles (0&#176; &lt; &#120579; &#8804; 3&#176;) improves to &#8776;9.15%, one of the highest percentages for CVD&#8208;grown tBLG within this range. Density functional theory calculations explain in detail the assisted effect of oxygen on the rapid growth and twist angle distribution of tBLG. Furthermore, the presence of a clear moir&#233; superlattice, ultrahigh Hall mobility of 20&#8201;616 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, weak localization effect, and Shubnikov&#8208;de Haas oscillations corroborate the high&#8208;quality of tBLG. The research offers a new and feasible way of growing tBLG.

         <title>Rational Development of a Novel Emulgel Adjuvant for Single&#8208;Shot Effective Vaccination: A Multivariate Analysis Approach</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using multivariate analysis, a novel emulgel adjuvant is developed by combining key nanoemulsion formulation variables&#8211;hydrogel trapping, small globule size, and mannide monooleate surfactant&#8211;achieving 10&#215; greater immunogenicity than MF59 in mice after a single shot. The emulgel matched Freund's adjuvant in immunogenicity and efficacy, ensured safety, and offers promise for single&#8208;dose vaccines, advancing adjuvant design and pandemic preparedness.








Abstract
Nanoemulsions, like MF59, are potent vaccine adjuvants due to their immunogenicity, scalability, stability, and generation of broad cross&#8208;clade neutralizing immune responses, facilitating their feasibility for pandemic preparedness. However, they are unsuitable for single&#8208;shot applications due to limited immunogenicity with subunit antigens, and need to be explored for key immunogenic formulation variables like surfactant type, antigen anchoring, oil&#8208;globule solidification, hydrogel polymer trapping, or globule size. Here, a multivariate analysis approach is used for the first time in adjuvant development, selecting 14 formulations from over 150, each with a unique formulation variable, to evaluate their immunological properties on C57BL/6 mice. Results show that nanoemulsions with hydrogel trapping, smaller globule size, or mannide monooleate cosurfactant significantly enhance immunogenicity, each by 5&#8208;to&#8208;10 folds over MF59. For the first time, these formulation variables are combined into an &#8220;optimized emulgel&#8221; that is predicted to maximize immunogenicity after a single shot, model fit gave (R2 = 0.97). The optimized emulgel triggers long&#8208;lasting immune responses matching both the model's prediction and those triggered by the gold&#8208;standard Freund's adjuvant against various antigens, while maintaining excellent safety. The findings highlight the potential of emulgels as a novel adjuvant class and underscore the utility of multivariate analysis in adjuvant design.

         <title>2D Time&#8208;Stretching Anisotropic Synapse Realizing In&#8208;Sensor Intensity&#8208;Spanning Visual Feature Fusion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel 2D TSAS that enables in&#8208;sensor intensity&#8208;spanning feature fusion is presented, enabled by combined in&#8208;plane anisotropy and time&#8208;stretching photoresponse of 2D NbOI2. Leveraging these properties, a neuromorphic preprocessing strategy for single&#8208;shot visual learning across extreme brightness domains has been constructed, achieving accelerated model convergence with minimal training loss, offering a compact and efficient solution for contrast&#8208;adaptive intelligent vision in complex real&#8208;world environments.








Abstract
High&#8208;dynamic&#8208;range (HDR) visual environments, where extremely bright and dark regions coexist, pose major challenges for conventional imaging systems that rely on multi&#8208;frame exposure fusion and cloud&#8208;based post&#8208;processing. These approaches often suffer from high latency, limited efficiency, and privacy concerns, making them unsuitable for real&#8208;time or edge&#8208;level intelligent vision. Here, a 2D Time&#8208;Stretching Anisotropic Synapse (2D TSAS) is reported that enables in&#8208;sensor intensity&#8208;spanning feature fusion from a single image frame. The 2D TSAS uniquely integrates two key features of NbOI2 material: in&#8208;plane anisotropy, which gives rise to polarization&#8208;resolved optical responses, and a time&#8208;stretching photoresponse arising from multi&#8208;channel transition&#8208;relaxation. This dual&#8208;mode mechanism enables direct encoding and temporal integration of spatial&#8208;polarization and luminance features during photoexcitation. Leveraging this behavior, a neuromorphic preprocessing strategy is constructed for single&#8208;shot visual learning across extreme brightness domains. The system achieves accelerated model convergence with minimal training loss, reaching recognition accuracies of &#8776;95.41% on NWPU&#8208;RESISC45 and &#8776;95.39% on MNIST. This work offers a compact and efficient solution for contrast&#8208;adaptive intelligent vision in complex real&#8208;world environments.

         <title>Highly Exposed Ultra&#8208;Small High&#8208;Entropy Sulfides with d&#8208;p Orbital Hybridization for Efficient Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;engineering design of ultra&#8208;small high&#8208;entropy sulfides (HES) in carbon nanofibers synergizes d&#8208;p orbital hybridization and size effects, enabling efficient oxygen evolution with low overpotential (200&#160;mV) and ultrastable 300&#160;h operation. Electronic modulation via d&#8208;p orbital hybridization shifts the d&#8208;band center and redistributes interfacial charges, optimizing oxygen evolution reaction (OER) intermediates adsorption and accelerating proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer kinetics.








Abstract
Precise regulation of electronic structure and nanoscale geometry represents a transformative strategy for breaking the activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off in oxygen evolution electrocatalysts.

         <title>Strategies for Lowering Hydrogen Permeation in Membranes for Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolyzers and Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights the critical issue of hydrogen permeation in perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA)&#8208;based proton exchange membranes used in water electrolyzers and fuel cells. It explores hydrogen transport mechanisms, measurement techniques, and recent mitigation strategies, including advances in alternative hydrocarbon membranes. Remaining challenges and future directions are also discussed to guide safer and more efficient PEM design.








Abstract
Proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolyzers and fuel cells are pivotal for renewable hydrogen technologies. The membrane electrode assembly (MEA) is a critical component in both technologies, with the PEM's core functionality&#8212;proton conduction coupled with gas impermeability&#8212;dictating overall cell performance and durability. One of the key challenges faced by the commercial perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA)&#8208;based PEMs is the high rate of hydrogen permeation, reducing efficiency and raising safety concerns due to hydrogen&#8211;oxygen mixing risks. Therefore, there is an urgent need to mitigate hydrogen crossover in PEMs to enhance operational efficiency and ensure cell safety, particularly for the high&#8208;pressure electrolyzers. This review commences by elucidating the hydrogen transport mechanisms in PFSA&#8208;based PEMs, along with the methodologies employed to measure hydrogen permeation. Subsequently, the recently developed strategies aimed at reducing hydrogen permeation in PEMs are summarized, with a primary focus on PFSA&#8208;based membranes, alongside considering advancements in alternative hydrocarbon polymer membranes. Finally, the challenges that remain are discussed, and potential solutions for addressing hydrogen permeation issues in PEM applications are proposed. This review seeks to provide valuable insights for both academic research and industrial applications, in the pursuit of low&#8208;hydrogen permeation PEMs specifically designed for water electrolysis and fuel cell technologies.

         <title>Multimodal Super&#8208;Cooling Textiles for All&#8208;Scenario Passive Hygrothermal Comfort</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a multimodal supercooling textile that integrates radiative, conductive, and evaporative functions by a 3D cladding strategy of nanosheets for all&#8208;scenario personal cooling. With high solar reflectance, a 3D thermally conductive network, and a Janus wetting structure, it cools 2&#160;&#176;C lower than cotton in a hot and humid environment, offering a new perspective for highly efficient human hygrothermal management.








Abstract
Radiative cooling textiles hold great promise for achieving personal thermal comfort amidst the rising global temperatures while enhancing productivity and saving energy. However, despite extensive research, most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art radiative cooling textiles possess solely radiative functions, failing to achieve highly efficient cooling across all scenarios, particularly as high temperatures and high humidity diminish non&#8208;radiative cooling power. This work presents a multimodal super&#8208;cooling textile that integrates radiative, conductive, and evaporative mechanisms through a 3D cladding strategy to enhance the cooling effect in various scenarios without compromising radiative performance. This method enables the surfaces of all 1D single fibers to be closely 3D clad with 2D boron nitride nanosheets, thereby achieving ultra&#8208;high solar reflectivity (97.30%), omnidirectional heat dissipation (in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane thermal conductivity of 2.40 and 0.33&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1, respectively), and unidirectional moisture&#8208;wicking properties (transport index of 1547%) through high backscattering efficiency, a 3D thermal conductivity network structure, and a Janus wetting structure. Enabled by the multi&#8208;cooling mechanisms, MST drops temperature by 20&#160;&#176;C versus cotton in outdoor sunlight. Even in hot, humid circumstances, it still provides a 2&#160;&#176;C cooling advantage over cotton. This work thereby provides a promising strategy for personal thermal and moisture management textiles across various complex environments.

         <title>Additive&#8208;Regulated Interface Chemistry Enables Depolarization for Ultra&#8208;High Capacity LiCoO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 2,4,6,8&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;2,4,6,8&#8208;tetravinylcyclotetrasiloxane (V4D4) forms interfacial atomic&#8208;scale adsorption bonding with the highly delithiated LiCoO2 surface during electrochemical processes, enabling in situ HF/H2O scavenging, and constructing a cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase (CEI) rich in Si&#8208;based components and polymers with enhanced Li+ conductivity. Consequently, the CEI's depolarization effect allows the LiCoO2 cathode to achieve a ultra&#8208;high discharge capacity of 220 mA h g&#8722;1 at 4.55 V.








Abstract
Unlocking the capacity potential of mainstream LiCoO2 (LCO) cathode materials for stable cycling at a high upper cut&#8208;off voltage is undoubtedly one of the most economical approaches to achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, significant polarization issues induced by interfacial and interphase degradation during high&#8208;voltage cycling remain well known. This study demonstrates the efficient depolarization effects of cyclic organosiloxane additive 2,4,6,8&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;2,4,6,8&#8208;tetravinylcyclotetrasiloxane (V4D4) at the cathode&#8211;electrolyte interface, facilitating interfacial charge transfer and enhancing the capacity of LCO||Li cells to 220&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 even at 4.55&#160;V (vs Li/Li+). Specifically, V4D4 tends to adsorb onto the surface of highly delithiated LCO cathodes, and its preferential oxidation intermediates help stabilize lattice oxygen, eliminate harmful HF/H2O, and form an ultrathin cathode&#8211;electrolyte interphase (CEI) that reduces interface resistance to Li+ diffusion and stabilizes the surface structure. Additionally, with the assistance of fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC), long&#8208;term cycling produces a homogeneous, chemo&#8208;mechanically stable CEI enriched in organic silicon&#8208;containing compounds and LiF. This CEI suppresses excessive bulk electrolyte decomposition, reinforces the reversibility of the significantly enhanced O3&#8212;H1&#8208;3 phase transition, and enables capacity retention of &#8776;97% after 200 cycles.

         <title>A Wideband Multimodal Flexible Sensor Integrating Vertical Graphene and Sea Urchin&#8208;Like Nanoparticles for Post&#8208;Stroke Rehabilitation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a speech reconstruction framework based on a dual&#8208;sensor system that collects wideband signals from vocal vibrations and throat muscle movements. An encoder&#8208;cycle&#8208;consistent generative adversarial networks (CycleGAN) model maps the signals to speech without requiring a large&#8208;scale paired training dataset. The system achieves over 95% intent recognition accuracy and generates natural&#8208;sounding speech with a mean opinion score of 2.9.








Abstract
Stroke is a leading cause of long&#8208;term disability worldwide, with post&#8208;stroke aphasia significantly impairing communication and social interaction. Traditional rehabilitation devices are often bulky, expensive, and impractical for daily use, particularly in speech recovery, where accessible and effective solutions remain limited. To address this challenge, this study introduces a portable and wearable sensor system for stroke&#8208;induced aphasia rehabilitation. The proposed sensor integrates a flexible, ultrasensitive, and durable dual&#8208;sensor system comprising an Ag&#8208;MnO2&#8208;based sea&#8208;urchin&#8208;like nanoparticle pressure sensor to detect high&#8208;frequency vocal vibrations and a vertical graphene/polydimethylsiloxane (VGr/PDMS) strain sensor to capture low&#8208;frequency muscular movements. The sensors, integrated into a flexible circuit, employ an encoder&#8208;cycle&#8208;consistent generative adversarial networks (CycleGAN)&#160;model that recognizes users' intent and recovers voice, significantly reducing dependency on large&#8208;scale labelled datasets. Experimental results demonstrate accurate intent recognition with accuracies for certain commands exceeding 95%. The reconstructed speech exhibits improved naturalness based on objective and perceptual evaluations, highlighting potential clinical utility in enhancing daily communication and interaction for stroke survivors.

To address this challenge, this study introduces a portable and wearable sensor system for stroke-induced aphasia rehabilitation. The proposed sensor integrates a flexible, ultrasensitive, and durable dual-sensor system comprising an Ag-MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based sea-urchin-like nanoparticle pressure sensor to detect high-frequency vocal vibrations and a vertical graphene/polydimethylsiloxane (VGr/PDMS) strain sensor to capture low-frequency muscular movements. The sensors, integrated into a flexible circuit, employ an encoder-cycle-consistent generative adversarial networks (CycleGAN)&#160;model that recognizes users' intent and recovers voice, significantly reducing dependency on large-scale labelled datasets. Experimental results demonstrate accurate intent recognition with accuracies for certain commands exceeding 95%. The reconstructed speech exhibits improved naturalness based on objective and perceptual evaluations, highlighting potential clinical utility in enhancing daily communication and interaction for stroke survivors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Breaking the Efficiency&#8208;Stability&#8208;Sustainability Trilemma in all&#8208;perovskite Tandem Solar Modules via Oxidative Blockchain Molecular Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents an oxidation&#8208;triggered blockchain molecular&#8208;assisted buried interface engineering strategy for achieving comprehensive lifecycle management of all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar modules and breaking the efficiency&#8208;stability&#8208;sustainability trilemma for practical applications.








Abstract
Narrow&#8208;bandgap (NBG) tin&#8208;lead (Sn&#8208;Pb) perovskites are vital for all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar modules (TSMs), yet their commercialization remains limited by challenges in balancing efficiency, stability, and sustainability. Here, we presented an oxidation&#8208;triggered blockchain molecular (BCM) interface engineering strategy, which modified the poly (3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly (styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) surface and constructed a dynamic functional layer at the buried PEDOT:PSS/Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite interface through synergistic effects of biocompatible rutin molecules and their oxidation derivatives. This approach enabled full&#8208;cycle optimization from film formation to operational longevity via sequential regulation of crystallization and carrier dynamics, along with persistent defect passivation through synergistic coordination and hydrogen bonding. Resulting NBG devices achieved champion efficiencies of 23.50% (0.045 cm2) and 17.10% (10.4 cm2), respectively. The all&#8208;perovskite TSMs (10.4 cm2) attained a 23.00% aperture efficiency (an active&#8208;area efficiency of 24.30%) and retained &#8764;90% efficiency after 640 h of continuous illumination (extrapolated TPCE80 lifetime of 3900 h) and after 15 cycles of day&#8208;night fatigue tests. Additionally, BCM's dual protection effects (physical barrier and chemical chelation) reduced lead leakage of severely damaged TSMs by 90% under simulated heavy rainfall, demonstrating strong environmental resilience. This work offers a scalable molecular strategy for advancing perovskite photovoltaics from lab&#8208;scale innovation to industrial viability.

         <title>Nonlinear Optical Response in Layer&#8208;Stacked Gallenene with Ferroelectric Polarization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid metals are utilized in applications ranging from soft robotics to conductive inks, owing to their physical properties providing distinct mechanical, electrical, and thermal advantages. This work uses classical material science techniques to characterize ferroelectric polarization in supercooled liquid gallium and utilizes second harmonic generation imaging for further perturbation analysis.








Abstract
Polar metals are very rare and challenging to realize due to the incompatibility of ferroelectricity and metallicity. Mobile electrons in polar metals effectively screen the static electric field and dipoles. Recent studies show that 2D van der Waals metals without an inversion center can have polar order due to specific layer stacking. However, room temperature reversible ferroelectricity and nonlinear second harmonic generation in non&#8208;centrosymmetric polar metals remain unrealized. Here, the experimental realization of AB&#8208;stacked gallenene (a100) nanocrystals with a room temperature ferroelectric polarization in a liquid gallium environment is reported. Using first&#8208;principles calculations, the origin of spontaneous polarization (Ps) due to a broken symmetry in multilayer gallenene structures, resulting in P1 (space group) and C1 (point group) symmetry is explained. The reversible polarization switching is characterized using piezoresponse force microscopy. This results demonstrate the reversible nonlinear optical response of the AB&#8208;stacked gallenene crystal through second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy. The intensities of SHG signals are controlled via angular rotations and thermal heating, which indicate a phase transition at high temperatures. Furthermore, electrical perturbation enables the tunability of SHG intensity. Bipolar resistive switching is demonstrated in a two&#8208;terminal device. These findings open avenues for advancements in 2D ferroelectricity, piezoelectricity, and topological superconductivity.

         <dc:description>
This review explores the current status of solvent&#8208;free fabrication methods of metal halide perovskites, such as thermal evaporation, magnetron sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, e&#8208;beam and atomic layer deposition, solid phase growth, and laser printing. It outlines the current state of knowledge and discusses key challenges and future research directions.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites have ascended as a remarkable class of materials in recent years, demonstrating exceptional promise for application in various electronic and optoelectronic devices. The vast majority of research on these materials focuses on their processing from solution, which is relatively easily executed in laboratory settings, but its scalability for industrial mass production remains a significant hurdle. Furthermore, its reliance on highly toxic solvents imposes limitations with respect to large&#8208;area fabrication and have a negative environmental impact. This review comprehensively explores the current status of solvent&#8208;free fabrication methods for metal halide perovskites, outlines the current challenges and opportunities, and provides a critical assessment of the technological readiness and future research directions. The development of robust and scalable solvent&#8208;free fabrication methodologies is essential to realizing the full potential of metal halide perovskites. We hope that this review will serve as a catalyst, inspiring and guiding researchers to explore new strategies for the solvent&#8208;free deposition of these remarkable materials, thereby expediting their integration into technological applications.

         <title>A Widely Tunable Spin&#8208;Orbit Torque Device through the Silicon Compatible CMOS Platform</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tunable spin&#8208;orbit torque device compatible with CMOS platform is present with large tunability and low operating voltage through the ultrathin ferroelectric film. The proposed integrated devices with hybrid architectures exhibit promising potential for low&#8208;power SOT&#8208;MRAM and other unconventional spin computing frameworks beyond Boolean logic.








Abstract
Analogous to the manipulation of electrons in field&#8208;effect transistors, achieving the voltage&#8208;controlled spin&#8208;orbit torque and spin current will become indispensable to next&#8208;generation spintronic devices, enabling nonvolatile cache memory, spin logic, and other advanced functionalities. Recently, considerable progress has been realized in the electric field control of spin&#8208;orbit torques. Due to the limitations of integration and operating voltage, the practical use of voltage&#8208;controlled MRAM is still challenging. Here a tunable spin&#8208;orbit torque device fully integrated within CMOS technology is reported with large tunability and low operating voltage. The proposed integrated MRAM devices with hybrid architectures exhibit significant acceleration in write speed and lower current thresholds. This could potentially facilitate the commercial exploitation of tunable spin&#8208;orbitronic devices and is also promising for spin transistors and unconventional computing frameworks beyond Boolean logic.

         <title>Robust Hydrogel Sensors Induced by Intermolecular Mechanical Interlocking of Covalent Organic Frameworks for Non&#8208;Invasive Health Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Robust hydrogel sensors have been constructed using covalent organic frameworks and polyacrylamide; the intermolecular mechanical interlocking promotes energy dissipation and ion transport, resulting in superior strength, high toughness, and high ionic conductivity, holding great promise for non&#8208;invasive health monitoring.








Abstract
The compromise of tensile strength and toughness is essential for conductive hydrogels to enhance their cycling stability and mechanical durability in wearable strain sensors. It is effective but challenging to balance energy dissipation. Herein, a new strategy based on the intermolecular mechanical interlocking of the hydrogels has been proposed for improving their tensile strength and toughness. The hydrogels are readily fabricated through non&#8208;covalently threading linear polymer chains into covalent organic frameworks (COFs). The mechanical interlocking between polyacrylamide and COFs significantly promotes the energy dissipation with synchronous increment of ion transport, which endows hydrogels with superior mechanical performance and high conductivity. The tensile strength, toughness, and ionic conductivity are as high as 0.19 &#177; 0.03 MPa, 2.11 &#177; 0.33 MJ m&#8722;3 and 2.30 &#177; 0.55 S m&#8722;1, respectively, which greatly surpass those in the polyacrylamide counterpart and rank the top in the reported hydrogels. The resultant hydrogel sensor achieves a fast strain response of 4.8 ms and high cyclic stability over 100 cycles, and could non&#8208;invasively monitor human health. This work provides one promising approach to the construction of robust hydrogels based on COFs for the development of advanced wearable sensors.

Herein, a new strategy based on the intermolecular mechanical interlocking of the hydrogels has been proposed for improving their tensile strength and toughness. The hydrogels are readily fabricated through non-covalently threading linear polymer chains into covalent organic frameworks (COFs). The mechanical interlocking between polyacrylamide and COFs significantly promotes the energy dissipation with synchronous increment of ion transport, which endows hydrogels with superior mechanical performance and high conductivity. The tensile strength, toughness, and ionic conductivity are as high as 0.19 &#177; 0.03 MPa, 2.11 &#177; 0.33 MJ m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; and 2.30 &#177; 0.55 S m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively, which greatly surpass those in the polyacrylamide counterpart and rank the top in the reported hydrogels. The resultant hydrogel sensor achieves a fast strain response of 4.8 ms and high cyclic stability over 100 cycles, and could non-invasively monitor human health. This work provides one promising approach to the construction of robust hydrogels based on COFs for the development of advanced wearable sensors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>One&#8208;Step Coordinated Multi&#8208;Kinetic 4D Printing of Human Vascularized Cardiac Tissues with Selective Fast&#8208;Shrinking Capillaries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a novel 4D bioprinting technique for fabricating cardiac tissues with complex microvasculature. Unlike traditional 3D printing, it enables capillary&#8208;scale structure formation via selective post&#8208;printing shrinkage. This approach overcomes resolution limits of printing cell&#8208;laden hydrogels, allowing the creation of functional, vascularized tissues with fine structural details essential for regenerative medicine applications.








Abstract
The field of 3D bioprinting has made substantial progress in recent years, enabling the fabrication of vascular networks within engineered tissues to support the efficient transfer of oxygen and nutrients. However, a critical limitation remains: the restricted resolution of cell&#8208;laden bioink hydrogels, which impedes the precise formation of microscale structures such as capillaries. In this study, a novel, sequential, one&#8208;step bioprinting approach is introduced that enables the deposition of multiple cell&#8208;laden bioinks, facilitating the fabrication of functional, complex cardiac tissues with hierarchical microvasculature. Remarkably, this strategy enables pre&#8208;designed blood vessels to undergo selective shrinkage to capillary&#8208;scale dimensions within the parenchymal tissue under physiological conditions. Engineered cardiac tissues with perfusable, endothelialized vascular networks exhibit robust contractile function, and in vivo implantation demonstrate successful anastomosis of the vasculature with the host. This bioprinting strategy represents a significant advancement in the engineering of physiologically relevant tissue architectures, paving the way for the development of functional organotypic constructs for regenerative medicine and transplantation.

         <title>Cation&#8208;&#960;/&#960;&#8211;&#960; Synergy Induced Self&#8208;Assembly of Semiconductor Spacers for High Efficiency and Stable 2D/3D Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong aromatic conjugated ammonium salt (PyPAI) spacers spontaneously form self&#8208;assembled columnar stacks via synergistic cation&#8208;&#960; and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. This simultaneously regulates crystallization and establishes a continuous charge transport pathway through a robust &#960;&#8208;conjugated network, overcoming dielectric confinement. Resultant 2D/3D PSCs achieve 26.41% efficiency with enhanced stability.








Abstract
2D/3D perovskite heterojunctions exhibit simultaneous improvement of efficiency and stability to meet commercial applications. However, dielectric confinement and an intrinsically uncontrollable crystallization process in 2D perovskites typically lead to large exciton binding energies and poor film quality, hindering charge dissociation, carrier transport, and ultimately device performance. Here, a strong aromatic conjugated ammonium salt spacer (PyPAI) that can spontaneously form self&#8208;assembled columnar stacks via synergistic cation&#8208;&#960; and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions is introduced, thereby simultaneously regulating crystal growth and enhancing charge transfer for high performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The in situ generated 2D perovskite phases effectively modulate nucleation and crystallization kinetics, yielding superior films with vertically oriented crystals and reduced grain boundary density. Concurrently, the robust aromatic &#960;&#8208;conjugated network establishes continuous energy bands, enabling highly efficient carrier shuttling between the inorganic Pb&#8208;I framework and the cationic organic layers. Consequently, PyPAI&#8208;optimized PSCs achieve a remarkable PCE of 26.41% with superior environmental and operational stability.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;mode 2D/3D interaction is realized through body&#8208;coupled energy transfer, achieving 200 &#181;m&#8208;resolution 2D calligraphy reconstruction and 200 mm&#8208;range 3D tracking with sub&#8208;millisecond mode switching for seamless cross&#8208;dimensional control. Meanwhile, an object&#8208;oriented human machine interaction (HMI)&#160;framework is proposed to enable multi&#8208;device interoperability by detecting electromagnetic signatures, resolving device isolation through bioinspired face&#8208;to&#8208;face interaction adaptable to metaverse digital twins.








Abstract
The metaverse progressively demands heightened sophistication in human&#8208;multi&#8208;machine collaboration, accelerating development of hybrid immersive 2D tactile and 3D spatial perception interfaces. However, current interfaces struggle with the precision and adaptability in complex human&#8208;multi&#8208;machine interaction scenarios. This paper presents a transparent stretchable sensing interface synergizing 2D tactile and 3D spatial perception through body&#8208;coupled electromagnetic coupling. Its bi&#8208;modal coupling (resistive coupling and capacitive coupling) mechanism enables micrometer&#8208;scale 2D tactile sensing alongside broad 3D spatial perception (200&#160;mm range). The contact mode achieves calligraphy&#8208;grade trajectory reconstruction (200 &#181;m precision) with force tactile sensing, while the non&#8208;contact mode recognizes 38 gestures at 97.11% accuracy. The interface's mechanical transparency and elasticity permit seamless integration on curved surfaces (e.g., gloves and clothes) without perceptual interference. An object&#8208;oriented human&#8208;machine interaction (HMI) framework is developed to enable single&#8208;interface control of multiple devices through electromagnetic signature recognition, enhancing collaborative efficiency. This work can inspire designs of smart interfaces in intelligent healthcare monitoring, industrial robotics coordination, and cross&#8208;domain augmented reality applications.

         <title>Origin of Synergy in Bicomponent Metal Nitride&#8211;Metal Single Atom Catalysts for Advanced Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive coupling model for metal nitride (MN) and metal single atoms (M&#8722;SA) is proposed to optimize the behavior of polysulfides, and elucidate the principles by which the hybrid catalyst facilitates the conversion of polysulfides. W&#8722;SA/WN as the model prepared and dispersed on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon sheets rendered batteries the increased capacity, superior rate performance, and enhanced cycling stability.








Abstract
To catalyze the sulfur redox kinetics of lithium&#8722;sulfur batteries (LSBs) can well enhance the capacity and longevity. However, the synergistic essence of bicomponent electrocatalysts for LSBs remains obscure. Here, this work introduces standardized descriptors to describe the underlying origin of catalysts&#8217; synergy for LSBs. Specifically, it pertains to the bi&#8722;functional electrocatalysts comprising a series of metal nitrides (MN) and partner metal single atoms (M&#8722;SA) for the conversion and migration of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). The M&#8722;SA with higher eg/t2g promotes the conversion of Li2S4&#8722;dominated decisive steps, alleviating the shuttling. Concurrently, MN with abundant bonding facilitates the migration of lithium sulfide, which significantly reduces the accumulation of insulating sulfide. Such independent but synergistic hybridization makes the bicomponent MN/M&#8722;SA possess improved catalysis over the S electrochemistry compared to their single components, which is also experimentally verified with W&#8722;SA/WN as the representative. The batteries provide considerable sulfur utilization, superior rate capability, and the assembled 6.31 Ah pouch&#8722;pack battery even has an ultra&#8722;high incipient energy density of 506.2&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 under high sulfur loading and lean&#8722;electrolyte. A thorough comprehension of the catalytic properties from both electronic and structural standpoints provides a novel viewpoint for understanding and designing LSBs&#8217; catalysts.

         <title>Discovery of Nodal&#8208;Line Superconductivity in Chiral Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral crystals, characterized by their structural handedness, exhibit exotic quantum phenomena. The La(Rh,Ir)Si family, featuring a double&#8208;helix chiral structure, hosts unconventional multifold fermion excitations and topological nodal&#8208;line superconductivity, the latter arising from an isotropic spin&#8208;orbit coupling with a specific strength. The proposed pairing phase diagram provides a comprehensive roadmap for identifying and engineering unconventional superconductivity in chiral crystals.








Abstract
Chiral crystals, whose key feature is the structural handedness, host exotic quantum phenomena driven by the interplay of band topology, spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC), and electronic correlations.

&lt;p&gt;Chiral crystals, characterized by their structural handedness, exhibit exotic quantum phenomena. The La(Rh,Ir)Si family, featuring a double-helix chiral structure, hosts unconventional multifold fermion excitations and topological nodal-line superconductivity, the latter arising from an isotropic spin-orbit coupling with a specific strength. The proposed pairing phase diagram provides a comprehensive roadmap for identifying and engineering unconventional superconductivity in chiral crystals.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chiral crystals, whose key feature is the structural handedness, host exotic quantum phenomena driven by the interplay of band topology, spin-orbit coupling (SOC), and electronic correlations. Due to the limited availability of suitable chiral-crystal materials, their unconventional superconductivity (SC) remains largely unexplored. Here, the discovery of unconventional SC in the La(Rh,Ir)Si family of materials is reported by combining muon-spin spectroscopy, band-structure calculations, and perturbation theory. This family, characterized by a double-helix chiral structure, hosts exotic multifold fermions that are absent in other topological chiral crystals. While LaRhSi behaves as a fully-gapped superconductor, the substitution of 4&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-Rh by 5&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-Ir significantly enhances the SOC and leads to the emergence of topological nodal-line SC in LaIrSi. The developed model shows that the nodal-line SC arises from an isotropic SOC with a specific strength. Such an exotic mechanism expands the conventional understanding of material candidates for unconventional SC, which typically rely on a significantly anisotropic SOC to promote the triplet pairing.

         <title>Competitive Crystallization Modulated Phase&#8208;Homogeneous Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskites for Monolithic Perovskite&#8208;Organic Tandem Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
Triphenyl phosphate is utilized to modulate Br/I competitive crystallization for improving compositional distribution, efficiency, and stability in wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) PSCs. The homogeneous WBG perovskite boosts the efficiencies up to record values of 21.39% (1.72&#160;eV) and 19.64% (1.84&#160;eV), and maintains 95% of its initial efficiency for 1100&#160;h. The resulting PO&#8208;TSCs achieve champion efficiencies of 26.11% (certified 25.07%).








Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskites with tunable bandgaps can be integrated into organic solar cells to construct tandem solar cells (TSCs), enabling the device to exceed the Shockley&#8208;Queisser efficiency limit. However, ionic mismatches and crystallization kinetics in WBG perovskites trigger inhomogeneous phase distribution and defects. In this work, a triphenyl phosphate (Tri&#8208;PyPA) is utilized to modulate Br/I competitive crystallization and compositional distribution. The preferential coordination of Tri&#8208;PyPA with PbBr2 reduces the effective charge on Pb2+ and changes the electrostatic interaction between Pb2+ and Br&#8722;/I&#8722; ions. It suppresses the rapid migration of highly diffusive (Br&#8208;rich) components during crystallization. Meanwhile, Tri&#8208;PyPA forms a six&#8208;membered hydrogen&#8208;bonded ring structure with formamidinium cations by H&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;O&#9552;P interaction to immobilize cations. The &#960;&#8208;&#960; conjugation allows Tri&#8208;PyPA to form a compact molecular coverage on the (100) facet, significantly reducing non&#8208;radiative recombination and elevating the ion migration energy barriers. The homogeneous WBG perovskites boost the efficiency up to record values of 21.39% and 19.64% for 1.72&#160;eV and 1.84&#160;eV devices, respectively. The unencapsulated device can maintain 95% of its initial efficiency after illumination for 1100&#160;h. The champion perovskite&#8208;organic TSC shows an efficiency of 26.11% (certified 25.07%) and retains 80% of its initial efficiency after continuous operation for 1000&#160;h.

2D sp2 carbon&#8208;linked COFs (dibenzo[g,p]chrysene&#8208;based DBC&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF and tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based TPE&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF) with Kagome (kgm) topology are synthesized using imine&#8208;linked dibenzo[g,p]chrysene&#8208;based COF (DBC&#8208;Imine&#8208;COF) as the template. DBC&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF exhibits an impressive photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of 172.93&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in water, especially 105.30 and 80.04&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in 3 wt.% saltwater and natural seawater, respectively. This work provides a rational strategy for the construction of COFs to enhance the photocatalytic HER.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D&#8208;COFs) have emerged as prominent photocatalysts for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. However, the exquisite design of linkage and topological structures is crucial for efficient charge generation, separation, and transfer in the planar periodic framework. Here, an imine&#8208;linked dibenzo[g,p]chrysene&#8208;based COF (DBC&#8208;Imine&#8208;COF) is presented as a template for topology&#8208;templated synthesis of two 2D sp2 carbon&#8208;linked COFs (dibenzo[g,p]chrysene&#8208;based DBC&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF and tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based TPE&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF) with Kagome lattice to boost photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. The fully conjugated DBC&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF is highly luminescent and exhibits topology&#8208;dependent &#960;&#8208;electron transmission and charge carrier mobility. Significantly, DBC&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF exhibits an impressive photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of 172.93&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and excellent reusability in the presence of 0.8 wt.% Pt under light irradiation, with a remarkable apparent quantum yield of 14.9% at 420&#160;nm. More importantly, DBC&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF demonstrates a hydrogen evolution rate of 105.30 and 80.04&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in 3 wt.% saltwater and natural seawater, respectively, highlighting its potential in real&#8208;world scenarios. DFT calculations and various spectroscopic analyses reveal that the highly coplanar structure of DBC&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF strengthens donor&#8208;acceptor interactions, facilitating charge generation and separation. In summary, this work provides an effective strategy to construct highly planar and full &#960;&#8208;conjugated dibenzo[g,p]chrysene&#8208;based 2D sp2 carbon&#8208;linked COF as a promising platform for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.

         <title>Interlayer Switching of NiO6 Octahedra Tilt via Interstitial Oxygen in Lan + 1NinO3n + 1 (n = 1, 2, 3)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The research presents an anti&#8208;parallel interlayer tilt coupling of NiO6 octahedra induced by interstitial oxygen in high&#8208;pressure oxygen annealing Lan + 1NinO3n + 1(n = 1,2, 3). The new coupling pattern brings new symmetry along the caxis, alters the electronic structure, and hinders the superconductivity in La3Ni2O7, directing a micro&#8208;structural route to investigate and tune the novel functionalities in Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskite nickelates.








Abstract
Oxygen octahedra tilt, an important knob to tune properties of perovskite oxides and their derivatives, determines the coupling patterns and emergent states. Conventional methods, such as strain and doping, are primarily employed to modulate the magnitude of the octahedra tilt. The switching of the tilt, however, is challenging due to the intrinsic interlocked coupling. Here, we achieve the interlayer switching of NiO6 octahedral tilting via interstitial oxygen insertion in Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Lan + 1NinO3n + 1 (n = 2). Interstitial oxygen with an alternative occupation in the rock&#8208;salt (LaO) layers induces completely opposite tilt patterns of NiO6 octahedra in neighboring perovskite (LaNiO3) layers. EELS reveals a lower unoccupied UHB and a spectral&#8208;weight transfer, which may contribute to the suppression of superconductivity in La3Ni2O7 as confirmed by our high&#8208;pressure transport experiments. This mechanism of NiO6 octahedral tilt switching is further validated in Lan + 1NinO3n + 1 (n = 1 and 3), offering a promising strategy for regulating the properties of layered perovskite oxides.

         <title>Interface Engineering and Optimization Strategies for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Batteries Based on Polymer Composite Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here the interface challenges of composite polymer electrolytes in high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries are delved into, innovative improvement strategies are explored, and their future industrialization is envisioned. By offering comprehensive insights, it serves as a valuable reference for researchers and engineers in the energy storage domain.








Abstract
Polymer composite electrolytes (PCEs) offer significant advantages in enhancing the safety, stability, and energy density of batteries, making them a crucial component for achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density energy storage systems. However, one of the primary bottlenecks in improving the performance of PCEs lies in the interface challenge, which can be exacerbated and manifested in interface instability, side reactions, and poor interface compatibility, ultimately leading to a significant decline in ion conduction efficiency and overall battery performance of high&#8208;voltage or high&#8208;energy&#8208;density systems. Therefore, systematically analyzing the critical technical narrowing and proposing targeted solutions under high&#8208;energy&#8208;density conditions is of great significance for advancing the development of next&#8208;generation energy storage systems. Although existing strategies have shown promising results, their applicability in high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries remains uncertain. In this work, a comprehensive analysis of the interface challenges associated with high&#8208;energy&#8208;density polymer batteries is performed, the feasibility of existing approaches is evaluated, and practical optimization strategies are proposed to address these critical issues. Moreover, the insights presented here provide valuable guidance for the industrial&#8208;scale production of PCEs, helping to bridge the gap between laboratory innovations and practical applications.

         <title>Ionoelastomer Synapses With Configurable Synaptic Plasticity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic heterostructures of polycationic chains and anions and semiconducting polymers form artificial synapses that update their synaptic weights via anion redistribution under electrical stimulation. Memory effects depend on anion species, enabling synaptic plasticity modulation. Continuously programmable nonvolatile conductance states are utilized to emulate a neural network, achieving handwritten digit and fashion image recognitions with high accuracies by using only 16 discrete device states.








Abstract
An organic heterostructure, composed of an ionoelastomer that comprises polycationic chains and mobile anions, and a semiconducting polymer, forms a new class of artificial synapses. These ionoelastomer synapses update their synaptic weights by modifying device conductance through the spatial redistribution of anions in response to electrical stimuli. The memory effect of these synapses is highly dependent on the specific anion species present, providing a unique means to modulate synaptic plasticity simply through anion selection. The continuously programmable and nonvolatile states of the selected ionoelastomer synapse are harnessed to emulate a soft neural network and perform the handwritten digit and fashion image recognition tasks, which achieve high recognition accuracies comparable to ideal numeric model but only using 16 discrete device states.

         <title>Optimizing the Electron Density of PVDF&#8208;HFP&#8208;Based Solid Polymer Electrolyte by Donor&#8211;Acceptor COF Toward High&#8208;Performance Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Br&#8208;COF with D&#8208;A characteristic is incorporated into PVDF&#8208;HFP, which can optimize electron density to create electron&#8208;rich environments, further promoting Li+ migration and LiF&#8208;rich SEI formation. The D and A units of Br&#8208;COF are confined in particular locations to create independent electron&#8208;hole transference channels, achieving rapid electron transfer dynamics to optimize electron density around TFSI&#8722; to promote its decomposition for the formation of high LiF content SEI. Furthermore, the Br&#8208;groups as electron&#8208;rich sites can promote Li salt dissociation through electrostatic interaction, resulting in rapid Li+ transference.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries equipped with solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are recognized as promising energy storage devices due to their excellent safety and good interfacial contact. However, unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and sluggish Li+ transport kinetics inhibit their practical application. Herein, a bromine&#8208;modified covalent organic framework (Br&#8208;COF) with donor (D)&#8208;acceptor (A) characteristics is designed and incorporated into PVDF&#8208;HFP&#8208;based SPEs to regulate electron density for promoting Li+ migration and high stability LiF&#8208;rich SEI formation to solve these problems. The D and A units of Br&#8208;COF are confined in particular locations to create independent electron&#8208;hole transference channels, achieving rapid electron transfer dynamics, thereby promoting TFSI&#8722; decomposition to obtain high LiF content SEI. Meanwhile, the strong electron&#8208;withdrawing Br&#8208;group can adsorb the electron from tetra(p&#8208;amino&#8208;phenyl)porphyrin (TAPP) to create an electron&#8208;rich environment, resulting in the regulation of the Li+ local coordination environment to facilitate Li+ transference. Consequently, Br&#8208;COF@PVDF&#8208;HFP exhibits high ionic conductivity (9.2&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1) and Li+ transference number (0.78). Li|Br&#8208;COF@PVDF&#8208;HFP|Li cells achieve excellent cycling life (3000 h) at 0.1 mA cm&#8722;2, and LFP|Br&#8208;COF@PVDF&#8208;HFP|Li and NCM90|Br&#8208;COF@PVDF&#8208;HFP|Li cells can cycle steadily over 2000 cycles and 250 cycles, respectively. This study provides a reference basis for regulating the electron density of PVDF&#8208;HFP&#8208;based SPEs to enhance the performance of solid&#8208;state LMBs.

         <title>Color Tuning in Ferroelectric Nematic Liquid Crystals using Triptycene/Hydrazone Chiral Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoresponsive chiral ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals (NF*LCs)&#160;have been obtained by doping a polar liquid crystal host (DIO) with chiral triptycene/hydrazone&#8208;based bistable photoswitches. Upon irradiation with 442 and 340&#160;nm light sources, the pitch of the NF*LCs can be reversibly phototuned at 50&#160;&#176;C, resulting in the reflection and locking&#8208;in of the primary colors, red, green, and blue.








Abstract
The development of light&#8208;tunable ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals (NFLCs) will allow for the multi&#8208;stimuli control over the properties of this newly discovered LC phase. Here on the development of photoresponsive chiral ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals (NF*LCs) is reported by incorporating chiral triptycene/hydrazone&#8208;based bistable photoswitchable dopants into the polar liquid crystal mesogen DIO. The propeller&#8208;like dopants exhibit high helical twisting powers with values of 13.5 &#181;m&#8722;1 in DIO, with a further increase in value to 31.0 &#181;m&#8722;1 upon 442&#160;nm light&#8208;induced Z &#8594; E photoisomerization. This process results in the tuning of the NF*LC's reflection color from near infrared, to red, green, and finally blue at 50&#160;&#176;C. The reverse color transition can be induced by 340&#160;nm light irradiation, which drives the E&#8594;Z photoisomerization of the hydrazone. The ferroelectric nature of the NF*LC phase is confirmed by applying an alternating current electric field (0.67&#160;V/ &#181;m, 10&#160;Hz, square wave), which initiated azimuthal deformations of the ferroelectric helix.

         <title>Proximity&#8208;Induced Ferroelectric Switching in Wurtzite/Fluorite Bilayers for High&#8208;Performance Ferroelectric Field&#8208;Effect Transistor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proximity&#8208;induced switching in AlScN/HfZrO2 and AlN/HfZrO2 bilayers enables a novel combination of low remanent polarization and high coercive field. A ferroelectric field&#8208;effect transistor incorporating an AlN/HfZrO2 gate stack yields a wide memory window, superior retention, and endurance characteristics. This work pioneers a new strategy for engineering ferroelectric response through integrating distinct ferroelectric materials.








Abstract
Proximity ferroelectricity, wherein polarization switching in one ferroelectric layer with a lower energy barrier can trigger switching in an adjacent ferroelectric with a higher energy barrier, has been demonstrated only in bilayers composed of structurally similar wurtzite&#8208;structured materials. This work demonstrates proximity&#8208;induced ferroelectric switching across a heterostructure composed of crystallographically and functionally dissimilar materials, wurtzite&#8208;structured AlScN and fluorite&#8208;structured HfZrO2. The AlScN/HfZrO2 and AlN/HfZrO2 bilayers exhibit cooperative switching dynamics despite their contrasting symmetry and polarization behaviors. This interfacial coupling produces a unique ferroelectric response, characterized by low remanent polarization and a high coercive field. Using the AlN/HfZrO2 bilayer, a ferroelectric field&#8208;effect transistor is fabricated on a p&#8208;type Si substrate with phosphorus&#8208;doped source and drain regions. The device shows a wide memory window with excellent retention and endurance. These results establish a versatile materials design strategy for engineering ferroelectricity via structural and functional heterogeneity.

         <title>Self&#8208;Stratifying Colored Radiative Cooling Paints Through Narrow&#8208;Band Color Preservation Scheme</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces an easy&#8208;fabrication and self&#8208;stratifying paint recipe that forms an absorptionscattering dual&#8208;layer structure, systematically preserving color while enabling subambient daytime radiative cooling. All colored paints exhibit outstanding subambient cooling potential (&gt;90% solar refletance and 0.94 sky window emissivity), and the coolest black paint achieves exceptionally high solar reflectance (&#8764;46%).








Abstract
Although significant energy&#8208;saving potential of passive daytime radiative cooling has led to diffusively white or reflective surfaces, achieving coloration expands their application for both aesthetic and functional purposes. However, it presents huge technical challenges in scalable processing. This work presents a novel and general self&#8208;stratifying approach for creating radiative cooling paints with various colors using selected narrow&#8208;band absorption dyes. Applied as a single coat, these paints self&#8208;assemble into an absorption&#8208;scattering dual&#8208;layer structure that efficiently displays color while minimizing light absorption. Three base colors (cyan, magenta, and yellow) are demonstrated to provide full daytime subambient cooling, achieving 93% solar reflectance and 0.94 sky window emissivity. One newly developed black paint achieves 46.3% solar reflectance and a temperature drop of up to 25&#160;&#176;C, outperforming commercial counterparts. A purple radiative cooling paint (mixed dyes) demonstrates the color customization potential within the CMYK space, addressing the dilemma between color and cooling for colored radiative cooling paints. The mechanical and surface properties, characterized by abrasion, adhesion, and contact angle tests, are on par with or surpassing commercial products. This unique self&#8208;stratifying mechanism enhances surface properties and provides new insights for developing high&#8208;volume loading paints and water&#8208;harvesting coatings without increasing fabrication complexity.

         <title>Cation&#8208;Selective Defects Engineering in A&#8208;Site Ordered Layered Perovskites for High&#8208;Performance Reversible Protonic Ceramic Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cation&#8208;selective defects strategy is proposed to decouple and optimize activity and durability of A&#8208;site ordered layered perovskites air electrode for reversible protonic ceramic cells (RPCCs). A specific cations&#8208;deficient Pr(Ba0.5Sr0.5)0.95Co1.5Fe0.5O5+&#948; displays superior activity and stability when used as an RPCCs air electrode, accelerating its commercialization.








Abstract
Reversible protonic ceramic cells facilitate efficient chemical&#8208;electrical energy interconversion, advancing renewable energy utilization. Commercial viability, however, demands intermediate&#8208;to&#8208;low temperatures (ILT, 400&#8211;600&#160;&#176;C) operation, currently constrained by air electrode performance. A&#8208;site ordered layered perovskite PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+&#948; (PBSCF) promises, yet faces activity and stability issues at ILT. Cation defects effectively tune defect structures in simple perovskites, boosting electrochemical performance, but their specific effects in A&#8208;site ordered perovskites with dual A&#8208;site environments remain unexplored. Here, A&#8208;site cation&#8208;selective defects are engineered to tune PBSCF's performance, with Pr&#8208;deficient (Pr0.95Ba0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+&#948;, p&#8208;PBSCF) and Ba/Sr&#8208;deficient (Pr(Ba0.5Sr0.5)0.95Co1.5Fe0.5O5+&#948;, bs&#8208;PBSCF) variants revealing distinct defects&#8208;performance relationships. Pr defects weaken Co&#9472;O covalency to activate Co sites, enhancing oxygen electrocatalytic activity. Concurrently, it lowers oxygen vacancy concentration, inhibiting hydration&#8208;induced lattice expansion. This stabilizes Ba&#9472;O/Sr&#9472;O bonds and mitigates Ba/Sr segregation, enhancing stability. However, the reduced oxygen vacancy concentration inhibits the material's hydration, lowering proton conduction and thus restricting activity enhancement. In contrast, Ba/Sr defects not only weaken Co&#9472;O covalency to activate Co sites, but also increase oxygen vacancy concentration, promoting proton and oxygen&#8208;ion transport, thereby significantly enhancing electrode activity. Furthermore, despite increased hydration, bs&#8208;PBSCF's larger&#8208;radius cation defects yield a smaller unit cell versus p&#8208;PBSCF, further strengthening Ba&#9472;O/Sr&#9472;O bonds and inhibiting Ba/Sr segregation, thus leading to superior stability.

         <title>Role of Precursor Miscibility in Area&#8208;Selective Atomic Layer Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study investigates how the chemical structure of alumina precursors affects their interaction with benzenethiol inhibitor layers on Cu surfaces during area&#8208;selective atomic layer deposition (AS&#8208;ALD). It reveals that ligand&#8208;dependent miscibility and Lewis acidity govern precursor infiltration and degradation of the inhibitor, leading to selectivity loss. The work introduces a new mechanism for selectivity failure in AS&#8208;ALD processes.








Abstract
Area&#8208;selective atomic layer deposition (AS&#8208;ALD) is of increasing importance in nanostructure fabrication, and precursor selection is critical to realizing a successful process. This work explores the role of the precursor in achieving AS&#8208;ALD of Al2O3&#160;on a dielectric (SiO2) in the presence of a metal (Cu/CuOx). Four different precursors&#8212;dimethylaluminum isopropoxide (DMAI), trimethylaluminum (TMA), triethylaluminum (TEA), and triisobutylaluminum (TIBA)&#8212;are tested against a benzenethiol (BT) inhibitor. BT forms monolayers on Cu, whereas on CuOx&#160;it forms a thick crystalline multilayer composed of 1D&#8208;coordination polymers of Cu&#8208;thiolate (CuBT). This work observes that DMAI provides exceptional selectivity: 22&#160;nm of Al2O3&#160;can be deposited on patterned substrates with 99.9% selectivity, and in the case of thick CuBT can achieve excellent pattern transfer on nanoscale patterns with well&#8208;defined material interfaces. In contrast, none of the alkylaluminum precursors show significant selectivity, a result attributed to their miscibility in the CuBT multilayer leading to its degradation. This work proposes that the miscibility of the alkylaluminum precursors depends on ligand length and structure. The results show that the ligand&#8208;dependent miscibility and subsequent degradation of CuBT impact the location of Al2O3&#160;nucleation. This study&#160;highlights new considerations for AS&#8208;ALD process design to achieve high selectivity.

&lt;p&gt;This study investigates how the chemical structure of alumina precursors affects their interaction with benzenethiol inhibitor layers on Cu surfaces during area-selective atomic layer deposition (AS-ALD). It reveals that ligand-dependent miscibility and Lewis acidity govern precursor infiltration and degradation of the inhibitor, leading to selectivity loss. The work introduces a new mechanism for selectivity failure in AS-ALD processes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Area-selective atomic layer deposition (AS-ALD) is of increasing importance in nanostructure fabrication, and precursor selection is critical to realizing a successful process. This work explores the role of the precursor in achieving AS-ALD of Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;on a dielectric (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in the presence of a metal (Cu/CuO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;).

         <title>Pyridocarbene&#8208;Based Tetradentate Pt(II) Complexes for Long Device Lifetime over 500 h in Blue Phosphorescent Organic Light&#8211;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt&#8208;impy and Pt&#8208;Me&#8208;impy exhibit external quantum efficiencies of 24.5% and 27.4% at the 3&#160;wt.% doping concentration, respectively. In particular, Pt&#8208;impy and Pt&#8208;Me&#8208;impy doped blue PhOLEDs optimized for stability demonstrate a device lifetime of up to 95% of the initial luminance of 543 and 228 h at 1000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, which has never been achieved in the blue PhOLEDs.








Abstract
Blue phosphorescent organic light&#8211;emitting diodes (PhOLEDs) face challenges in achieving high efficiency, color purity, and long device lifetime due to exciton quenching and high energy requirements. In this study, two tetradentate Pt(II) complexes, Pt&#8208;impy and Pt&#8208;Me&#8208;impy, are designed and synthesized by incorporating pyridocarbene in their ligands. Pyridocarbene enhances the electrochemical stability, strengthens triplet metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer characteristics, and improves the spin&#8211;orbit coupling, effectively shortening the exciton lifetime and minimizing the quenching effects. Additionally, the introduction of a methyl group as a conformation manager in Pt&#8208;Me&#8208;impy further improves the color purity by blue&#8208;shifting and narrowing the emission spectrum. As a result, Pt&#8208;impy and Pt&#8208;Me&#8208;impy exhibit external quantum efficiencies of 24.5% and 27.4% at the 3&#160;wt.% doping concentration, respectively. In particular, Pt&#8208;impy and Pt&#8208;Me&#8208;impy doped blue PhOLEDs optimized for stability demonstrate a device lifetime of up to 95% of the initial luminance of 543 and 228&#160;h at 1,000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, which has never been achieved in the blue PhOLEDs. This study demonstrates that the synergistic combination of pyridocarbene and the methyl conformation manager is an effective strategy for improving blue PhOLED performance, enhancing their potential for practical applications.

         <title>Radiative Cooling in Outer Space: Fundamentals, Advances in Materials and Applications, and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Space RC materials face unique orbital challenges, including extreme temperature fluctuations, dust deposition, VUV radiation, and AO erosion. This review distinguishes space RC from terrestrial RC and highlights recent advances for effective thermal control. It further emphasizes space RC material degradation and protection under harsh conditions, offering critical insights for spacecraft thermal management and future material innovation.








Abstract
Effective thermal control is critical for the safe operation of spacecraft in the harsh environment of outer space. Radiative cooling (RC), an advanced passive thermal management technology, enables spontaneous heat dissipation via infrared radiation into the ultracold cosmic background. It offers an energy&#8208;efficient solution for maintaining temperature stability without power input. While RC materials have demonstrated promising potential in space applications, a systematic review focusing specifically on their performance and adaptability in space environments remains lacking. To fill this gap, this review first clarifies the fundamental and material&#8208;requirement differences between terrestrial and space&#8208;based RC. Next, it focuses on the space environmental effects on RC materials and their protection strategies, including extreme temperature fluctuations, space dust deposition, vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) radiation, and atomic oxygen (AO) erosion. Finally, key challenges and future research directions are discussed to guide the development of next&#8208;generation RC materials for integrated spacecraft thermal control. This work provides valuable insights into advancing RC technologies, with implications for improving energy efficiency, extending mission lifespans, and enhancing system reliability in future space exploration.

         <title>Bioinspired Polyimide/Carbon Nanotube Aerogels With Core&#8208;Radiating and Omasum&#8208;Like Morphology toward Excellent Electromagnetic Shielding and Superior Elasticity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A morphogenetic approach is established to precisely coordinate the precursor thermodynamics by tuning the carbon nanotube (CNT) content and precursor concentration in the framework of the freeze&#8208;drying method. Consequently, polyimide/CNT aerogels with unprecedented triaxial hierarchical architectures (macroscopic core&#8208;radiating patterns, microscopic omasum&#8208;like folds, and nanoscopic CNT bridges) are obtained.








Abstract
Lightweight polymer&#8208;based electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding materials exhibiting good mechanical adaptability and thermal stability are pivotal for next&#8208;generation electronics. However, conventional approaches utilized to enhance the EMI shielding efficiency (SE) through porous architectures often compromise the structural integrity of the material or its EMI shielding performance under dynamic deformation. Herein, a morphogenetic approach is proposed to precisely coordinate the precursor thermodynamics by tuning the carbon nanotube (CNT) content and precursor concentration in the framework of the freeze&#8208;drying method. With this method, polyimide/CNT aerogels with unprecedented triaxial hierarchical architectures (macroscopic core&#8208;radiating patterns, microscopic omasum&#8208;like folds, and nanoscopic CNT bridges) are obtained. The synergy between these multiscale structures extends the dissipation pathways of electromagnetic waves by inducing multiple reflections, yielding an EMI SE of 71&#160;dB and an ultrahigh specific efficiency (6470&#160;dB cm2 g&#8722;1). Remarkably, the C67&#8208;5.0 aerogels also exhibit enhanced EMI shielding performance with temperature (5.0% improvement at 350&#160;&#176;C), a negative Poisson's ratio (around &#8722;0.28), and structural stability (&#8776;90% height retention after 500 compression cycles). This unique combination of a high EMI SE, outstanding mechanical properties, and excellent structural compressibility opens new avenues for designing adaptive EMI shielding systems for application to aerospace and electronics industries.

         <title>A p&#8208;Type Liquid&#8208;Crystal Semiconductor with Synergistic Morphological and Charge&#8208;Dynamic Modulation Enables 20.3%&#8208;Efficiency Binary Organic Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
A classical p&#8208;type liquid crystalline organic semiconductor, 2&#8208;decyl&#8208;7&#8208;phenyl&#8208;benzothienobenzothiophene (Ph&#8208;BTBT&#8208;10), is incorporated into the organic photovoltaic active layer as a dual&#8208;functional additive. Its incorporation optimizes the blend morphology with favorable phase separation, extends exciton diffusion length, and significantly improves charge transport dynamics. The binary device based on D18:L8&#8208;BO processes using Ph&#8208;BTBT&#8208;10 yields an impressive power conversion efficiency of 20.3%.








Abstract
Solid additives serve as an effective strategy for modulating the morphology of organic solar cell (OSC) active layers, which critically linked to devices performance. However, current solid additives primarily focus on morphological control, while their inherently weak electrical characteristics may limit improvements in carrier mobility and other electrical properties. This study innovatively introduces a p&#8208;type rod&#8208;like liquid crystalline (LC) organic&#8208;semiconductor, 2&#8208;decyl&#8208;7&#8208;phenylbenzo[b]benzo[4,5]thieno[2,3&#8208;d]thiophene (Ph&#8208;BTBT&#8208;10), as a multifunctional additive in D18:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based binary OSCs. Benefiting from its strong &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and high intrinsic mobility, Ph&#8208;BTBT&#8208;10 enables precise morphological control while simultaneously improving electrical properties. This dual effect synergistically extends exciton diffusion length, enhances charge separation, suppresses recombination, and significantly boosts hole mobility in blend films. Consequently, the optimized binary devices attained a competitive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.3%, alongside a short&#8208;circuit current density of 27.28&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and fill factor of 80.5%. To the best of knowledge, this performance ranks among the highest reported for binary systems exceeding the 20% PCE threshold. This work demonstrates that p&#8208;type LC semiconductors function as multifunctional additives capable of concurrently regulating morphology and boosting intrinsic electrical properties by establishing expanded charge&#8208;transport networks, presenting a promising new paradigm for advancing OSC performance.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solid additives serve as an effective strategy for modulating the morphology of organic solar cell (OSC) active layers, which critically linked to devices performance. However, current solid additives primarily focus on morphological control, while their inherently weak electrical characteristics may limit improvements in carrier mobility and other electrical properties. This study innovatively introduces a p-type rod-like liquid crystalline (LC) organic-semiconductor, 2-decyl-7-phenylbenzo[b]benzo[4,5]thieno[2,3-d]thiophene (Ph-BTBT-10), as a multifunctional additive in D18:L8-BO-based binary OSCs. Benefiting from its strong &#960;-&#960; stacking and high intrinsic mobility, Ph-BTBT-10 enables precise morphological control while simultaneously improving electrical properties. This dual effect synergistically extends exciton diffusion length, enhances charge separation, suppresses recombination, and significantly boosts hole mobility in blend films. Consequently, the optimized binary devices attained a competitive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.3%, alongside a short-circuit current density of 27.28&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and fill factor of 80.5%. To the best of knowledge, this performance ranks among the highest reported for binary systems exceeding the 20% PCE threshold. This work demonstrates that p-type LC semiconductors function as multifunctional additives capable of concurrently regulating morphology and boosting intrinsic electrical properties by establishing expanded charge-transport networks, presenting a promising new paradigm for advancing OSC performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Superstructure Engineering Enables NASICON&#8208;Type Phosphate Cathodes with Increased Working Voltage and Energy Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By regulating the calcination temperature during synthesis, the Fe3+ is preferentially migrated to Na+ vacancies to generate Fe/Na_v superstructure ordering in monoclinic Na3VFe(PO4)3 (NVFP&#8208;S), which can increase Fe&#9472;O ionic characters due to electronic structure arrangement, finally elevating the Fe2+/Fe3 redox potential from 2.37 to 2.82&#160;V, corresponding to the energy density increase from 325 to 350&#160;W h kg&#8722;1 versus the conventional Na3VFe(PO4)3 (NVFP).








Abstract
Na+ Super Ionic CONductor (NASICON)&#8208;type iron&#8208;based phosphate cathode has attained extensive research interest due to its green, low cost, and superior rate capability for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, owing to strong Fe&#9472;O covalent character in the NASICON frameworks, the low Fe2+/Fe3+ redox potential (&lt;2.5&#160;V vs Na+/Na) has led to an undesirable energy density of phosphate cathode. Herein, superstructure engineering is employed to increase the ionic characteristics of Fe&#9472;O bonds and the working voltage of Fe2+/Fe3 redox couples. The combined analysis of advanced structural characterization and theoretical calculation indicates that the Fe3+ ions can migrate to Na+ vacancies to generate Fe/Na_v superstructure ordering by manipulating calcination temperature during synthesis. The Fe delocalization and electronic structure rearrangement can enlarge the energy gap between antibonding orbital and the Fermi energy level. As a concept proof, the as&#8208;prepared Na3VFe(PO4)3 cathode with Fe/Na_v superlattice structure enables an increase in Fe2+/Fe3 redox couples from 2.37 to 2.82&#160;V, accompanied by the energy density increase from 325 to 350&#160;W h kg&#8722;1, compared with the conventional Na3VFe(PO4)3 electrode. This work paves the way for increasing the working voltage and energy density of NASICON type iron&#8208;based phosphate cathodes for SIBs.

         <title>Passively Ultra Cooling Patch Enabling High&#8208;Efficiency Power&#8208;Water Cogeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photovoltaics are the most viable solar energy technology. This work introduces an ultra&#8208;cooling patch (UCP) for passive thermal management of PV, achieving a 28% increase in power density and a water production rate of 2.2 L day&#8722;1. The enhancement results from the aligned channels and configurable heat transfer pathways of the UCP, which significantly improve thermal dissipation performance.








Abstract
Photovoltaic (PV) systems, which accounted for 75% of global renewable energy capacity in 2023, are limited by the substantial waste heat generated through the photothermal effect, reducing both electricity generation efficiency and panel longevity. In this work, a passive cooling strategy using an ultra&#8208;cooling patch (UCP) that effectively cools down the PV panel is presented, thus achieving an exceptionally high cooling power of nearly 700&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;2 and facilitating the recovery of over 70% of waste heat for freshwater production. The flexibility and adhesive properties of UCP allow for easy integration with various PV configurations, including flexible panels. In addition, the UCP can be easily reconfigured into a fined structure, enabling modifications to the heat transfer pathway. This passively intensifies the heat dissipation of the PV panel, further enhancing the cooling performance. As a result, a remarkable temperature reduction of 29&#160;&#176;C for the PV panel is achieved, which in turn results in an impressive increase in maximum power density of over 28%. Moreover, outdoor experiments on a &#8776;1&#160;m2 PV panel validated the cooling performance and practical applicability. This study offers a solution with commercial potential to relieve the energy&#8208;water crisis, owing to its high efficiency, scalability, and cost&#8208;effectiveness.

         <title>Solar&#8208;Driven Atmospheric Water Production Through Hierarchically Ordered Porous Carbon for Self&#8208;Sustaining Green Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Green hydrogen production through a coupled self&#8208;sustaining solar&#8208;enabled system that couples atmospheric water harvesting with PEM water electrolysis (AWH&#8208;PEMWE), offering a novel pathway for clean water generation and green hydrogen production. The system operates without the need for carrier gases or external energy input accessories, enabling a fully solar&#8208;driven process with zero carbon emission throughout the hydrogen production cycle.








Abstract
Green hydrogen production by proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) powered by clean energy is a promising and environmentally friendly technology. However, it relies on a high&#8208;purity water source, which is limited in regions facing water scarcity. Here, a coupled self&#8208;sustaining solar&#8208;enabled system is reported that couples atmospheric water harvesting with PEM water electrolysis (AWH&#8208;PEMWE), offering a novel pathway for clean water generation and green hydrogen production. The atmospheric water harvester (AWH) component utilizes N and O co&#8208;doped hydrophilic ordered porous carbon, engineered with an interconnected hierarchical porous structure with prosperous channels for efficient mass transport. It enables effective interfacial solar evaporation for water release, achieving a record&#8208;high water harvesting capacity of 0.49 L kg&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 at 40% relative humidity (RH). During outdoor tests, the AWH&#8208;PEMWE system reaches a peak green hydrogen production rate of 204 mL h&#8722;1 at midday using only atmospheric water as feedstock. Remarkably, the system remains operational under ultra&#8208;low humidity conditions down to 20% RH, addressing the challenge of water availability in arid environments. Importantly, the system operates without the need for carrier gases or external energy input accessories, enabling a fully solar&#8208;driven process with zero carbon emission throughout the hydrogen production cycle.

         <title>Symmetric Multi&#8208;Resonant TADF Emitters via Chiral Space Conjugation Toward Strong Chiroptical Responses and Narrowband Green Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a chiral space conjugation strategy, a highly efficient chiral multi&#8208;resonant thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitter incorporating the [2.2]paracyclophane unit is prepared, realizing strong chiroptical responses with absorption dissymmetry factor over 0.02 and pure green emission with Commission Internationale de I&#8217;&#201;clairage y coordinate of 0.70. Furthermore, highly efficient circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes with remarkable luminance of 241k cd m&#8722;2, external quantum efficiency over 29% and ideal efficiency roll&#8208;off are achieved.








Abstract
Developing thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials with excellent chiroptical and photophysical properties is crucial for advancing optoelectronic applications. Herein, a chiral space conjugation strategy incorporating a typical [2.2]paracyclophane unit is proposed to construct a highly efficient chiral multi&#8208;resonant (MR) TADF emitter, R(S)&#8208;PCP&#8208;DBNO. Guided by the symmetry&#8208;matching rule, the molecular design achieves balanced contribution and optimal alignment of transition electric and magnetic dipole moments, resulting in a strong chiroptical response with a dissymmetry factor (|gabs|) exceeding 0.02. Meanwhile, owing to the special through&#8208;space conjugation, the enantiomer exhibits pure green emission with a peak at 526&#160;nm, a narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 26&#160;nm, a Commission Internationale de I&#8217;&#201;clairage y coordinate of 0.70 and a quantum efficiency of 0.94 in toluene solution. When integrated into sensitized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), R(S)&#8208;PCP&#8208;DBNO delivers a maximum luminance up to 241k&#160;cd&#183;m&#8722;2, a maximum external quantum efficiency up to 29.4% and minimal efficiency roll&#8208;off. Furthermore, the devices demonstrate distinct circularly polarized electroluminescence, confirming the utility of this strategy for chiral MR&#8208;TADF emitters and circularly polarized OLEDs with simultaneous color purity, efficiency, and chiroptical functionality.

         <title>MXene&#8208;Assisted Rapid Gelation and Foaming of Gradient Hydrogel as Human&#8208;Machine Interfaces with Regulated Charge Accumulation/Dissipation and Enhanced Tactile Sensing Capability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative strategy is proposed to improve the performance of hydrogel&#8208;based tactile sensors through manipulating the interfacial properties and ion transport kinetics rather than barely enlarging the contact area. The phase&#8208;transition&#8208;induced hydrogel foam with gradient porous structure and interfacially accumulated MXene nanosheets simultaneously achieves high sensitivity of 4267 kPa&#8722;1 and a wide detectable range up to 100 kPa.








Abstract
Hydrogel&#8208;based tactile sensors, typically featuring a sandwiched structure of electrode/hydrogel/electrode with charges (electrons and ions) accumulated at both interfaces forming electrical double layers (EDLs), are considered promising candidates as human&#8208;machine interfaces (HMIs); however, the continuous dense structure limits the deformability of bulk hydrogels, hindering the achievement of high&#8208;sensitivity and wide detectable range. Moreover, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategies for enhancing sensitivity predominantly focus on enlarging the changes of hydrogel/electrode contact area upon external force, while overlooking the design of interfacial properties and ion transport kinetics. Herein, polyacrylamide/chitosan/MXene (PAM/CS/MXene, PCM) hydrogels with gradient porosity and tailorable softness are developed following the phase&#8208;transition&#8208;induced foaming mechanism. Ti3C2TX MXene plays critical roles in promoting rapid gelation, stabilizing bubbles, regulating ion transport kinetics, and modulating charge accumulation/dissipation at the hydrogel/electrode interfaces. As a consequence, the obtained PCM foam (PCMF) tactile sensor exhibits an optimal sensitivity of 4267 kPa&#8722;1 together with a wide detectable pressure range up to 100 kPa. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept applications are demonstrated for acquiring and identifying gesture commands to control a robotic arm for swab sampling and the movement of an electric car in a maze game by integrating PCMF sensors with a digital camera for visual feedback and machine learning for accurate recognition, respectively.

         <title>Dirac Fermion and Phonon Coupling Toward Giant Nernst Thermoelectric Performance in Topological Semimetal TaSb2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a giant ordinary Nernst effect (ONE) in the topological semimetal TaSb2&#8212;attributed to phonon&#8208;drag&#8208;induced enhancement of the Seebeck coefficient in its electron&#8208;hole bands under conditions of high carrier mobility and electron&#8208;hole compensation. The resulting large Nernst thermopower and transverse power factor, driven by Dirac fermion and phonon coupling, represent the highest values reported within the XPn2 (X = Ta, Nb; Pn = As, Sb) family and establish a novel framework for designing high&#8208;performance transverse thermoelectrics.








Abstract
Electron and hole compensation and ultrahigh mobility of topological semimetals are becoming a guiding principle for designing thermoelectric materials with large Nernst effect, following which several topological semimetals are discovered. Here, beyond the desirable band features, the essential role of Dirac Fermion and phonon coupling is further highlighted for the exceptional Nernst effect. By investigating the topological semimetal of TaSb2 single&#8208;crystalline, a high Nernst thermopower of 1200 &#181;V K&#8722;1 and a giant Nernst power factor (PFN) of 8300 &#181;W cm&#8722;1 K&#8722;2 are observed, which are record values in the topological XPn2 (X = Ta, Nb; Pn = As, Sb) family. In particular, the Dirac Fermion and phonon coupling presented by the phonon&#8208;drag effect amplifies the respective Seebeck coefficients of electrons and holes and therefore enhances the Nernst thermopower. These results provide new insights for future design of novel materials with large Nernst effects and demonstrate the potential of TaSb2 for solid&#8208;state cooling and thermo&#8208;management at cryogenic temperatures.

         <title>Frequency Switching Neuristor for Realizing Intrinsic Plasticity and Enabling Robust Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A frequency switching (FS) neuristor is proposed, comprising a Mott memristor and a valence change mechanism (VCM) memristor. The FS neuristor exhibits a multi&#8208;level frequency&#8211;voltage (f&#8211;V) characteristics, enabling the implementation of neuronal intrinsic plasticity transfer functions. By leveraging the FS neuristor's intrinsic plasticity, a more reliable and robust sparse neural network can achieve, well&#8208;suited for edge neuromorphic computing.








Abstract
The human brain's efficiency and adaptability in processing information is largely attributed to spatiotemporal spiking activities and intrinsic plasticity&#8212;the ability of neurons to autonomously modulate their excitability. Mott memristors, with their threshold switching characteristics, have been effectively utilized as artificial neurons, or neuristors, to generate spiking activities. However, the implementation of intrinsic plasticity and its significance in neuromorphic computing has yet to be systematically explored. Here, a frequency switching (FS) neuristor is presented that emulates neuron's intrinsic plasticity characteristics. By combining a volatile Mott memristor with a non&#8208;volatile valence change memory (VCM) memristor, the FS neuristor achieves programmable multi&#8208;level frequency&#8211;voltage (f&#8211;V) characteristics analogous to the transfer functions of neuronal intrinsic plasticity. Through device&#8208;based simulations of sparse neural networks, it is proposed that this intrinsic plasticity acts as memory and processor itself, enhancing network performance and reducing energy consumption. Additionally, intrinsic plasticity endows the network with structural plasticity, enabling full recovery of the network's performance after random neuron damage, suggesting a pathway toward more adaptive and resilient neuromorphic computing systems.

This study presents an Ir1@FA@MOFs nanocomposite that exploits copper&#8208;coordination and glutathione reduction to trigger an in situ Type II&#8208;to&#8208;Type I photodynamic switch, effectively alleviating tumor hypoxia while simultaneously inducing cuproptosis, ferroptosis, and PANoptosis, thereby potentiating immunogenic cell death for enhanced cancer immunotherapy.

Abstract
The clinical translation of photodynamic therapy (PDT) faces dual challenges of tumor hypoxia and antioxidant defense mechanisms.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clinical translation of photodynamic therapy (PDT) faces dual challenges of tumor hypoxia and antioxidant defense mechanisms. To address these limitations, herein tumor microenvironment (TME)-adaptive nanoparticles are rationally designed that enable oxygen-independent PDT while reprogramming immunosuppressive TME. An Ir(III) complex (&lt;b&gt;Ir1&lt;/b&gt;) is engineered to achieve copper-mediated and glutathione (GSH)-activated switching of photodynamic modes from oxygen-dependent Type II to hypoxia-tolerant Type I PDT via coordination-induced modulation of electron transfer. This dynamic photosensitizer is precisely integrated into folate receptor-targeted azomidazole-bridged Cu(II)-MOFs, creating an &#8220;AND logic&#8221; responsive nanoplatform (&lt;b&gt;Ir1@FA@MOFs&lt;/b&gt;) that simultaneously depletes GSH and generates hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH) and superoxide anion (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8226;&#8210;&lt;/sup&gt;) under light irradiation.

         <title>Decoupling of Carrier Pathways in Au/Cu&#8208;Zn3In2S6 Through Bulk Hole Trapping and Surface Hot Electron Accumulation Enhances Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We design and implement Au&#8208;Cu co&#8208;modified Zn3In2S6 catalyst with spatially decoupling charge carriers across bulk and surface sites, which effectively suppresses carrier recombination, drives surface hot electron accumulation and stabilizes intermediates for photocatalytic oxygen reduction. The optimized catalyst achieves an H2O2 evolution rate of 94.2 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 min&#8722;1 using pure water without any sacrificial agents, far exceeding most reported photocatalysts. 








Abstract
Artificial photosynthesis offers a sustainable route to H2O2 production but is hindered by charge recombination and non&#8208;selective reactive species generation, resulting in parasitic reactions that reduce selectivity and yield. Here, Au&#8208;Cu co&#8208;modified Zn3In2S6 (Au/Cu&#8208;d/ZIS) is presented, a catalyst that spatially decouples charge carriers across bulk and surface sites, suppressing recombination and stabilizing intermediates for photocatalytic oxygen reduction. Cu doping introduces trap states that localize holes in the bulk and improve the separation and transportation of bulk photogenerated carriers. Plasmonic Au nanoparticles drive surface hot electron accumulation and further contribute to the oxygen reduction reaction. The optimized catalyst achieves an H2O2 evolution rate of 94.2 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 min&#8722;1 using pure water without any sacrificial agents, outperforming pristine Zn3In2S6 by nearly threefold. DRIFTS identifies stabilized oxygenated species on the catalyst surface, and DFT calculations demonstrate that Cu trap states lower energy barriers for &#8226;O2&#8722; formation, while Au NPs enhance the charge transfer and ORR reaction between ZIS and O2. The catalyst maintains stability and reusability, producing 2300 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 of H2O2 under natural sunlight over 4 h with consistent performance across multiple cycles. Furthermore, it is successfully applied for bacterial sterilization and pharmaceutical pollutant degradation, demonstrating its potential for environmental remediation.

Du et&#160;al. demonstrate field&#8208;free spin&#8211;orbit torque switching down to 0.8 ns in wafer&#8208;scale van der Waals ferromagnet/Pt heterostructures. By engineering coexisting perpendicular and in&#8208;plane anisotropies via Fe composition gradient, robust and deterministic switching is achieved at room temperature, offering a scalable route toward ultrafast and energy&#8208;efficient 2D spintronic memory devices.








Abstract
Electrical manipulation of magnetism in 2D van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnet (FM) holds promise for next&#8208;generation spintronic devices. Investigating field&#8208;free, ultrafast switching at room temperature in wafer&#8208;scalable vdW heterostructures can advance the development of faster memories and enhance the understanding of magnetization switching mechanisms in 2D FMs. In this study, field&#8208;free, room temperature spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT) switching at subnanosecond timescales in a wafer&#8208;scalable Fe3GaTe2/Pt heterostructure by epitaxial growth engineering is demonstrated. The introduction of a variable concentration gradient of Fe is used to establish the coexistence of in&#8208;plane magnetic anisotropy (IMA) and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) within the ferromagnetic layer. The field&#8208;free switching, driven by the SOT from Pt, is achieved by using the IMA component to break the in&#8208;plane symmetry during the switching process. This work paves the way for the integration of efficient 2D vdW materials in advanced spintronic devices and faster memory technologies.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Corrosive Covalent Iodo&#8208;Thiadiazole Catalyst Enables Aqueous Zn&#9472;S Batteries with High Coulombic Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In aqueous Zn&#8211;S batteries, a covalently bonded iodo&#8211;thiadiazole redox mediator suppresses parasitic I3&#8722;&#8208;mediated Zn corrosion and enhances Zn&#8211;S redox kinetics, enabling pouch cell with a high capacity of 1398 mAh g&#8722;1 after 120 cycles. This innovative catalyst design is a leap toward practical and grid&#8208;scale aqueous Zn&#8211;S batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;sulfur batteries (AZSBs) hold great promise for large&#8208;scale energy storage but suffer from low Coulombic efficiency (CE) due to sluggish Zn&#9472;S redox kinetics and severe Zn anode corrosion, limiting their cycling life and practical applicability. Although state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art iodine&#8208;based redox mediators can accelerate cathode kinetics, they typically result in the formation of free I3&#8722; species, which exacerbate Zn corrosion. Here, we report a covalent iodo&#8211;thiadiazole redox mediator (CIM) as an anti&#8208;corrosive and highly efficient catalyst to achieve high CE in AZSBs. The covalently anchored iodine in CIM effectively suppresses free I3&#8722; formation and mitigates Zn corrosion. More importantly, dynamic electronic restructuring from C5&#9552;N to C5&#9472;N bonds (C5: 5th&#8208;position carbon in the thiadiazole ring) promotes Zn&#8211;S redox kinetics through a &#963;&#8208;coordination electron pathway facilitated by the Zn&#9472;I&#9472;C5 bond. As a result, CIM&#8208;based coin cells achieve an average CE of 99.56% and a capacity of 344 mAh g&#8722;1 after 700 cycles at 8 C. The CIM&#8208;based pouch cell demonstrates a high capacity of 1398 mAh g&#8722;1 after 120 cycles at 0.8 C. This work presents a practical design strategy for iodine&#8208;based catalysts, enabling next&#8208;generation aqueous metal&#8208;sulfur batteries with enhanced durability and performance.

         <title>Interface&#8208;Induced Stability of Nontrivial Topological Spin Textures: Unveiling Room&#8208;Temperature Hopfions and Skyrmions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first room&#8208;temperature, zero&#8208;field observation of stable skyrmion&#8211;hopfion spin textures in EuS&#9472;Bi2Se3&#9472;EuS trilayers is reported. Combining Lorentz TEM imaging and micromagnetic modeling, the authors unveil how interfacial Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction and geometric confinement stabilize these multidimensional topological states. These findings offer a pathway toward ultralow&#8208;power spintronic devices harnessing robust, chiral magnetism in engineered topological heterostructures.








Abstract
Topological spin configurations, such as soliton&#8208;like spin texture and Dirac electron assemblies, have recently emerged in fundamental science and technology. Achieving stable topological spin textures at room temperature is crucial for their use as long&#8208;range information carriers. However, their creation and manipulation are hindered by multi&#8208;step field training and competing interactions.

     alt="Interface-Induced Stability of Nontrivial Topological Spin Textures: Unveiling Room-Temperature Hopfions and Skyrmions"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first room-temperature, zero-field observation of stable skyrmion&#8211;hopfion spin textures in EuS&#9472;Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#9472;EuS trilayers is reported. Combining Lorentz TEM imaging and micromagnetic modeling, the authors unveil how interfacial Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction and geometric confinement stabilize these multidimensional topological states. These findings offer a pathway toward ultralow-power spintronic devices harnessing robust, chiral magnetism in engineered topological heterostructures.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topological spin configurations, such as soliton-like spin texture and Dirac electron assemblies, have recently emerged in fundamental science and technology. Achieving stable topological spin textures at room temperature is crucial for their use as long-range information carriers. However, their creation and manipulation are hindered by multi-step field training and competing interactions. Thus, a spontaneous ground state for multidimensional topological spin textures is desirable, with skyrmions forming swirling, hedgehog-like spin structures in two dimensions and hopfions as their twisted 3D counterparts. Here, the first observation of robust and reproducible topological spin textures of hopfions and skyrmions observed at room temperature and in zero magnetic field is reported, which are stabilized by geometric confinement and protected by interfacial magnetism in a ferromagnet/topological insulator/ferromagnet trilayer heterostructure. These skyrmion-hopfion configurations are directly observed at room temperature with Lorenz transmission electron microscopy. Using micromagnetic modeling, the experimental observations of hopfion-skyrmion assemblies are reproduced. This model reveals a complete picture of how spontaneously organized skyrmion lattices encircled by hopfion rings are controlled by surface electrons, uniaxial anisotropy, and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. This study provides evidence that topological chiral spin textures can facilitate the development of magnetic topological carriers, paving the way for ultralow-power and high-density information processing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Impact of Strain in Free&#8208;Standing PtSe2 in Scalable 2D MEMS</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strain tuning of 2D materials such as PtSe2 opens new opportunities for micro&#8208; and nanoelectromechanical systems (MEMS/NEMS). This study introduces a fabrication method for free&#8208;standing, as&#8208;grown thin&#8208;film channels that bypass mechanical transfer, offering a scalable, universal platform for strain engineering. Optical and electrical characterization, combined with finite&#8208;element simulations, reveals how polycrystallinity influences the strain&#8208;dependent properties of large&#8208;scale&#8208;grown 2D materials.








Abstract
2D layered materials such as PtSe2 are prime candidates for next&#8208;generation micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;electro&#8211;mechanical systems (MEMS/NEMS), including piezoresistive sensors. However, due to difficulties in large&#8208;scale synthesis and the inherent drawbacks associated with mechanical transfer of 2D material films, scalable NEMS production remains challenging. In this work, we report a fabrication route for free&#8208;standing, as&#8208;grown 2D material channels of PtSe2 with controlled dimensions, avoiding a mechanical film transfer. The free&#8208;standing devices provide a universal platform for strain engineering of 2D materials because tension can be easily controlled by application of a back&#8208;contact voltage. Moreover, the piezoresistivity of PtSe2, together with the possibility of wafer&#8208;scale synthesis at back&#8208;end&#8208;of&#8208;line compatible growth temperatures, make it ideally suited for scalable incorporation into integrated circuits. Our measurements show that the material properties can be tuned via strain, which offers pathways for classically non&#8208;gateable materials in electronic and photonic devices. Finite element simulations of representative free&#8208;standing films elucidate the nano&#8211;mechanical properties of large&#8208;scale&#8208;grown, polycrystalline 2D materials under tensile strain and demonstrate the influence of polycrystallinity on the optical and electrical behavior.

         <title>Fast, Reconfigurable Domain&#8208;Wall Logic in a Magnetic Insulator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterostructures of magnetic insulator TbIG and ultrathin Co layers enable field&#8208;free current&#8208;driven domain&#8208;wall motion over 1.4 km&#160;s&#8722;1. All 16 two&#8208;input Boolean logic operations are experimentally demonstrated within a single domain&#8208;wall device via current density and initial magnetization state adjustment, holding the potential for energy&#8208;efficient, high&#8208;density in&#8208;memory computing architectures.








Abstract
Conventional computing systems, based on silicon transistors, face challenges in meeting the growing demand for high computing efficiency in applications such as big data and artificial intelligence. Spin&#8208;based logic devices, particularly those utilizing chiral domain walls, offer a promising alternative due to their potential for high&#8208;performance and integration with high&#8208;density memory. Here, heterostructures composed of magnetic insulator TbIG and ultrathin Co layers are created, enabling field&#8208;free current&#8208;driven domain&#8208;wall motion at speeds exceeding 1.4&#160;km s&#8722;1. Based on the unique velocity phase diagram with respect to the in&#8208;plane field and current density, the implementation of all 16 two&#8208;input Boolean logic operations, including NAND, AND, XOR, and XNOR, is experimentally demonstrated by adjusting the current density and initial magnetization state. The results highlight the feasibility of multifunctional logic gates in spintronic systems and show the potential for energy&#8208;efficient, high&#8208;density in&#8208;memory computing architectures.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Artificial Muscle&#8208;Tendon Complex of Liquid Crystal Elastomer for Bidirectional Afferent&#8208;Efferent Signaling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Muscle&#8211;tendon complex (MTC)&#8208;inspired Liquid crystal elastomer (LCE)&#160;artificial muscle integrates actuation (efferent) and proprioceptive sensing (afferent) by combining contractile nematic and elastic isotropic LCEs within a single soft structure. Embedded liquid metal channels enable simultaneous Joule heating and real&#8208;time sensing of length and force. The proposed system demonstrates effective closed&#8208;loop control applicable to physical human&#8211;robot interaction.








Abstract
The muscle&#8208;tendon complex (MTC) in biological systems integrates contractile actuation and proprioceptive sensing, enabling coordinated feedback control of muscle activations through simultaneous afferent (sensory) and efferent (motor) signaling. To achieve similar functionality, artificial muscles, often based on polymeric materials with intricate material behaviors, require embedded proprioceptive capabilities to enable adaptive and reliable feedback control. Here, an artificial MTC&#8208;inspired liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) muscle with embedded physical intelligence is presented that supports simultaneous sensing and actuation. The proposed system utilizes embedded liquid metal (LM) channels for Joule heating and sensing of mechanical states, such as force and length, within the LCE structure. The multimaterial design combines isotropic LCE and nematic LCE, each with distinct thermomechanical properties optimized for specific functions, allowing for responsive contractile actuation&#160;and efficient proprioception. Integrated within a single, compact structure, this artificial muscle combines all sensing and actuation components, enhancing compliance and proprioceptive functionality. Furthermore, the LCE actuators are arranged in an antagonistic pair, mirroring the setup of biological muscles, to improve controllability and coordination. These MTC&#8208;inspired LCE artificial muscles demonstrate closed&#8208;loop feedback control in robotic applications, such as a robotic finger and gripper system, highlighting the potential of embedded physical intelligence in advanced robotic control systems.

         <title>Toposelective Functionalization of Solution&#8208;Processed Transition Metal Dichalcogenides with Metal Nanoparticles via Defect Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a novel strategy for toposelective functionalization of solution&#8208;processed transition metal dichalcogenides with noble metal nanoparticles via galvanic displacement. Owing to the selective edge decoration with gold, palladium, or platinum nanoparticles, the hybrid materials exhibit new properties and improved device performance in sensing, electrocatalysis, and electronics. This approach exploits a defect engineering strategy to produce multifunctional mixed&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides commonly serve as quintessential 2D substrates and templates to develop hybrid structures with novel and/or enhanced properties and performance. However, the effects and control of their ubiquitous and abundant structural defects are still poorly explored and understood. Here, exploiting their highly reactive and defective edges, an unprecedented strategy is introduced for their toposelective functionalization with noble metal nanoparticles through galvanic displacement. Selectively edge&#8208;decorated transition metal dichalcogenides nanosheets are successfully produced with gold, palladium, or platinum nanoparticles, showing tunable loading and size. As proof of concept, the hybrid systems are tested for optical and photothermal sensing, as well as electrocatalysis and electronics, demonstrating their enhanced functionality and broad applicability. These findings pave the way for the versatile production of mixed&#8208;dimensional multifunctional materials, achieved by harnessing the defective nature of solution&#8208;processed transition metal dichalcogenides via molecular chemistry approaches.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>

Abstract
Natural cell&#8208;inspired nanoparticles (NCINPs) represent a transformative innovation in nanomedicine, featuring a core&#8211;shell structure coated with isolated natural cell membranes (NCMs) that effectively mimic the functions of native cells. The development of NCINPs achieves molecular&#8208;level emulation of native cells by precisely reconstructing the hierarchical architecture of the bio&#8208;interface, including the structure of the phospholipid bilayer, lipid rafts, protein matrix, and polysaccharide interactions. This advanced biomimetic strategy not only retains the inherent biocompatibility and targeting precision of natural cells but also enables programmable functionalities that surpass those of natural systems, offering enhanced therapeutic potential. In this review, an in&#8208;depth introduction to the background of natural cell&#8208;inspired research is provided, the current prevalent synthesis methods of NCINPs is delineated, and the application mechanisms based on various types of NCMs, as well as their applications in both benign and malignant diseases are elucidated. However, clinical translation faces significant challenges: complex synthesis, compromised membrane functionality, and unpredictable in vivo behavior. The work comprehensively synthesizes the progress, limitations, and challenges encountered throughout the development of NCINPs, while delineating future prospects. Bridging the translational gap from bench to bedside accelerates the clinical translation of NCINPs and fully realizes their therapeutic potential across diverse medical applications.

In this work, a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art hybrid flow machine learning (HFML) framework is designed to efficiently discover HEO compositions. The factors affecting structural stability, including s&#8208;block metal ions, Cu2+, high&#8208;valence d0 and d10 metal ions are further verified. In conclusion, this work accomplishes the full chain study from artificial intelligence material prediction, and performance verification to pilot application.








Abstract
How to proficiently and accurately explore the vast compositional space of materials and accelerate the development of new materials with outstanding properties, especially structurally complex high&#8208;entropy oxides (HEOs), remains a challenge in materials science. To address this, a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art hybrid flow machine learning (HFML) framework is proposed, which combines ensemble learning, unsupervised learning, and Bayesian optimization, enabling efficient discovery of hidden patterns and comprehensive exploration of the component space. Based on the proposed HFML, a new HEO cathode material is screened out from over 2 million candidates for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (Na0.95Li0.06Ni0.25Cu0.05Fe0.1Co0.05Mn0.44Ti0.05O2), which shows excellent cycling stability (capacity retention of 83.6% after 1200 cycles) and high&#8208;rate performance (110 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10 C, and 96 mAh g&#8722;1 at 20 C). Key factors affecting structural stability are identified, including s&#8208;block metal ions, Cu2+, high&#8208;valence d0 and d10 metal ions, and are verified by electrochemical tests and in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. Additionally, pilot&#8208;scale production is achieved, and 2 Ah pouch cells based on this cathode demonstrate 95.0% capacity retention after 600 cycles. This work accomplishes the full chain study from artificial intelligence material prediction, creation, and performance verification to pilot application (mass production and pouch sodium batteries).

         <title>Host Cell Membrane&#8208;Cloaked Nanomedicine Reprograms Endothelial Surface for Enhanced Patency in Allogeneic Vascular Grafts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work developed a host red blood cell membrane&#8208;cloaked nanomedicine loaded with a TGF&#8208;&#946; signaling inhibitor for metabolically&#8208;guided cell surface reprogramming to enhance the patency of allogeneic vascular grafts via the synergistic combination of localized steric immune shielding and in situ therapeutic delivery.








Abstract
The endothelium serves as the first point of contact following the implantation of allogeneic vascular grafts (AGs) or organs. Rapid endothelial injury triggered by immunocytotoxicity, combined with subsequent endothelial dysfunction during vascular tissue remodeling, collectively exacerbates complications, including thrombosis, inflammation, and intimal hyperplasia, ultimately leading to graft failure. In this study, a nanomedicine, R&#8208;SB@PLGA, is developed for use in metabolically guided cell surface reprogramming (CSR) in AGs. R&#8208;SB@PLGA is fabricated by encapsulating SB431542 (SB)&#8208;loaded poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles within host red blood cell membranes (RBCM). Upon immobilization, this nanomedicine reprograms the epitope presentation of endothelial cells (ECs), establishing localized steric immune shielding to preserve endothelial integrity without the need for systemic immunosuppression. Concurrently, the nanomedicine releases SB to inhibit the transforming growth factor&#8208;&#946; (TGF&#8208;&#946;)&#8208;mediated endothelial&#8208;to&#8208;mesenchymal transition (EndMT), thereby preventing endothelial dysfunction during vascular tissue remodeling. In animal models of allogeneic carotid artery transplantation, R&#8208;SB@PLGA showed significant efficacy in enhancing graft patency by reducing vascular inflammation and intimal hyperplasia. By integrating site&#8208;specific immune shielding with in situ therapeutic delivery, a novel paradigm is established for improving transplant outcomes through localized intervention, which is highly promising for promoting the success of allogeneic vascular or organ transplantation.

         <dc:description>
This review focuses on the design and development of self&#8208;healing materials mediated by host&#8211;guest (HG) interactions, with particular emphasis on cyclodextrins (CDs). Furthermore, this review highlights cutting&#8208;edge applications of &#946;CD&#8208;based self&#8208;healing materials in sensors, 3D printing, tissue engineering, anti&#8208;corrosion coating, shape memory devices, and composites, demonstrating their adaptability to modern technological demands.








Abstract
Supramolecular self&#8208;healing (SH) materials have gained considerable attention for their ability to autonomously repair damage, thereby improving the longevity and performance of various systems. This review focuses on the design and development of SH materials mediated by host&#8211;guest (HG) interactions, with particular emphasis on cyclodextrins (CDs). Owing to their biocompatibility and excellent inclusion complexation capabilities, CDs&#8212;especially &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;CD)&#8212;play a key role in constructing HG&#8208;based SH systems. Recent progress in &#946;CD&#8208;based SH hydrogels for biomedical applications such as drug delivery, wound healing, and tissue engineering is discussed. In addition to healthcare, their application in smart coatings&#8212;including anti&#8208;fogging, fresh&#8208;keeping, and anti&#8208;corrosion layers&#8212;is reviewed. These materials are also integrated into sensors, demonstrating adaptability for real&#8208;time environmental and physiological monitoring. Emerging strategies involving 3D printing and shape memory functionalities further broaden their design potential. Despite these advances, challenges remain&#8212;particularly in scalability, environmental sensitivity, and achieving a balance between mechanical strength and healing efficiency. This review critically examines these limitations and highlights future directions, emphasizing the need for innovative fabrication approaches and interdisciplinary collaboration. By leveraging the unique properties of supramolecular interactions, &#946;CD&#8208;based SH materials offer promising solutions for a wide range of biomedical, industrial, and environmental applications.

         <title>Regular Tandem Quantum Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with over 51% External Quantum Efficiency for Next&#8208;Generation Displays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops a regular tandem quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diode achieving over 51% external quantum efficiency through systematic optimization of both charge injection balance and light out&#8208;coupling efficiency. Thanks to the fast response of this device, the obtained 8 &#215; 8 passive&#8208;matrix displays can present flicker&#8208;free images with either fixed color or dynamically transitioning colors at a stable brightness.








Abstract
Despite excellent efficiency and stability achieved in regular single&#8208;unit quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs), regular tandem QLEDs still suffer from limited device performance, lagging far behind the inverted tandem QLEDs. Here, novel regular tandem QLEDs are demonstrated with an ultrathin (&#8776;4 nm) indium tin oxide (ITO) charge generation layer (CGL). Through systematic optimization of charge injection balance and light out&#8208;coupling efficiency, the resulting tandem QLEDs can exhibit a record&#8208;breaking EQE of 51.2%, an exceptional T95 lifetime of &#8776;31383 h (at 1000 cd&#160;m&#8722;2), and an ultralow turn&#8208;on voltage of 2.8 V, which represent the highest performance metrics reported to date for regular tandem QLEDs. Thanks to the fast response of this tandem device (&#8776;4.8 &#181;s), the first&#8208;ever fabricated 8 &#215; 8 passive&#8208;matrix displays can present flicker&#8208;free images with either fixed color or dynamically transitioning colors at a stable brightness, demonstrating that the achievable color display capability and driving scheme of QLED displays can be expanded by using the tandem architecture. It is believed the results will significantly promote the development of regular tandem QLEDs, which will lead to unprecedented improvements in device efficiency and stability, accelerating their application in next&#8208;generation displays and lighting.

&lt;p&gt;This work develops a regular tandem quantum dot light-emitting diode achieving over 51% external quantum efficiency through systematic optimization of both charge injection balance and light out-coupling efficiency. Thanks to the fast response of this device, the obtained 8 &#215; 8 passive-matrix displays can present flicker-free images with either fixed color or dynamically transitioning colors at a stable brightness.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite excellent efficiency and stability achieved in regular single-unit quantum dot light-emitting diodes (QLEDs), regular tandem QLEDs still suffer from limited device performance, lagging far behind the inverted tandem QLEDs. Here, novel regular tandem QLEDs are demonstrated with an ultrathin (&#8776;4 nm) indium tin oxide (ITO) charge generation layer (CGL). Through systematic optimization of charge injection balance and light out-coupling efficiency, the resulting tandem QLEDs can exhibit a record-breaking EQE of 51.2%, an exceptional &lt;i&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;95&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; lifetime of &#8776;31383 h (at 1000 cd&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), and an ultralow turn-on voltage of 2.8 V, which represent the highest performance metrics reported to date for regular tandem QLEDs. Thanks to the fast response of this tandem device (&#8776;4.8 &#181;s), the first-ever fabricated 8 &#215; 8 passive-matrix displays can present flicker-free images with either fixed color or dynamically transitioning colors at a stable brightness, demonstrating that the achievable color display capability and driving scheme of QLED displays can be expanded by using the tandem architecture. It is believed the results will significantly promote the development of regular tandem QLEDs, which will lead to unprecedented improvements in device efficiency and stability, accelerating their application in next-generation displays and lighting.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhancing &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 Linkage Cleavage with Ultrahigh Faradaic Efficiency via Electrochemical&#8211;Chemical Tandem Catalysis for Lignin Valorization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrocatalytic&#8211;chemical strategy enables efficient lignin oxidation under mild alkaline conditions. The Au/CuO&#8208;catalyzed process cleaves &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 linkages via: i) electrochemical C&#945;&#9472;OH dehydrogenation and ii) spontaneous C&#945;&#9472;C&#946; scission. The tailored Au/CuO interface accelerates the critical dehydrogenation step, enhancing overall depolymerization efficiency.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic cleavage of &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 linkages in lignin has gained prominence as a sustainable strategy for biomass valorization. However, its broader application remains limited by key challenges, such as low Faradaic efficiency (FE), high oxidation potentials, and limited mechanistic understanding. To address these limitations, an electrochemical&#8211;chemical tandem catalysis system is developed for the electrooxidation of 2&#8208;phenoxy&#8208;1&#8208;phenylethanol (PPE). Mechanistic investigations revealed a two&#8208;step tandem process in PPE cleavage: i) electrochemical dehydrogenation of the C&#945;&#9472;OH groups, followed by ii) non&#8208;electrochemical C&#945;&#9472;C&#946; bond cleavage. The improved cleavage efficiency can be primarily attributed to the accelerated electrocatalytic dehydrogenation step. To optimize the adsorption of OH&#8722; and PPE molecules during electrocatalysis, an Au&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;decorated CuO nanoflakes (Au/CuO) electrocatalyst is designed. Comprehensive characterization techniques demonstrated that Au nanoparticles act as active sites for C&#945;&#9472;OH oxidation, while the CuO substrate facilitates PPE adsorption. Notably, the Au/CuO electrode achieved high product yields of 99.2% phenol and 80.2% benzoic acid at 0.95 VRHE, with a record&#8208;high FE of 74.7% for PPE conversion. Furthermore, the catalytic strategy was successfully extended to the depolymerization of organosolv lignin (OL). This study elucidates an electrochemical&#8211;chemical tandem mechanism for the electrocatalytic cleavage of lignin and presents an efficient electrocatalyst with high FE for lignin depolymerization.

         <title>Diamond&#8208;Inspired DNA Hydrogel Based on Tetrahedral Framework Nucleic Acids for Burn Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by diamond, this study introduces a DNA hydrogel formulated with tetrahedral DNA nanostructure, which exhibits enhanced mechanical strength. It exhibits multiple functionalities, including reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging, hemostatic performance, etc. Single&#8208;cell sequencing indicates this hydrogel disrupts the ROS&#8208;inflammatory cascade, promotes extracellular matrix formation and re&#8208;epithelialization, ultimately facilitating burn wound healing.








Abstract
Burn wounds frequently pose high risks of a prolonged healing process and even death due to the persistent reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;mediated inflammatory cascade. There is an urgent requirement for advanced dressings modulating the immune microenvironment surrounding the wound. DNA hydrogels have been preliminarily investigated in tissue regeneration due to their excellent permeability, editability, and biocompatibility. However, their broader applications have been limited by poor mechanical properties, and their roles in tissue regeneration remain insufficiently explored. Inspired by diamond, this study introduces a DNA hydrogel formulated with tetrahedral framework DNA, which exhibits enhanced mechanical strength due to its stable structure. Additionally, it exhibits multiple functionalities, including ROS scavenging, hemostatic performance, adhesion, injectability, shear&#8208;thinning behavior, and self&#8208;healing capability. Single&#8208;cell sequencing analysis indicates that this hydrogel disrupts the ROS&#8208;inflammatory cascade and promotes the transformation of pro&#8208;inflammatory macrophages into an anti&#8208;inflammatory phenotype. This effect promotes extracellular matrix formation and re&#8208;epithelialization with changes in the communication between macrophages, fibroblasts, and keratinocytes, ultimately facilitating burn wound healing on the skin of mice. In summary, this study not only presents a novel approach to bolstering the mechanical strength of pure DNA hydrogels but also marks a systematic evaluation of DNA hydrogels in regenerative medicine.

         <title>Adaptive Metaskins for Active and Passive Thermal Camouflage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the synergistic integration of reconfigurable MXene micro&#8208;wrinkles and a temperature&#8208;sensitive substrate, an adaptive metaskin that can operate in either active or passive modes is proposed for multi&#8208;scenario IR camouflage. This coupling design enables reversible, continuous, controllable, and wide&#8208;range emissivity modulation, ensuring robust adaptability across diverse thermal environments, opening up an additional degree of freedom in IR camouflage applications.








Abstract
Dynamic thermal camouflage conceals objects from infrared detection by modulating surface emissivity to match the thermal signature of the background. However, existing emissivity modulation systems fail to perform effectively across both hot backgrounds, such as sun&#8208;heated buildings and roads, and cold backgrounds, such as open fields. Here, an adaptive metaskin capable of operating in either active (externally powered) or passive mode is demonstrated, enabling effective camouflage across diverse thermal environments. This is achieved through the synergistic integration of a plasmonic MXene metasurface and a reprogrammable liquid crystal elastomer. The metaskin offers both a wide, continuously tunable emissivity range (&#8776;41%) and a rapid temperature response (1.2 s), selectively triggered in the passive mode. In cold backgrounds (e.g., 20&#160;&#176;C), the system operates in an active mode, delivering a non&#8208;volatile low&#8208;emissivity state that conceals objects across a wide temperature range (e.g., 20&#8211;120&#160;&#176;C). In hot backgrounds (e.g., 50&#160;&#176;C), it switches to passive mode, autonomously modulating its emissivity and maintaining an average infrared contrast of just 4.7&#160;&#176;C for objects of 50&#8211;120&#160;&#176;C. This dual&#8208;mode design is expected to address the challenges of active and passive thermal camouflage, opening new possibilities for dynamic thermal radiation management.

Single&#8208;Injection Self&#8208;Boosting Vaccines
A single&#8208;injection platform for self&#8208;boosting vaccines is developed using a polyanhydride&#8208;based delivery system. The platform enables pulsatile antigen release, protects pH&#8208;sensitive cargo, and elicits immune responses comparable to traditional multi&#8208;dose regimens. Machine learning enhances design by accurately predicting release profiles, offering a promising solution to improve global vaccine coverage and reduce under&#8208;immunization. More details can be found in article number 2501168 by Robert Langer, Ana Jaklenec, and co&#8208;workers.

Fracture Healing
In a micromotion mechanical environment, the &#8220;mechanical&#8208;electrical&#8208;pharmaceutical coupling&#8221; system converts mechanical energy into electrical signals, triggering stress&#8208;responsive Met release. The generated electrical signals suppress inflammation by promoting macrophage polarization from the M1 to M2 phenotype while enhancing osteogenesis. Simultaneously, Met inhibits the NF&#8208;&#954;B pathway to reduce pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines while activating the AMPK pathway to promote osteogenesis and angiogenesis. More details can be found in article number 2505061 by Xiaochen Zhang, Shuogui Xu, Hao Zhang, and co&#8208;workers.

         <title>Topology in Biological Piezoelectric Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the topological structures in biological piezoelectric materials, covering morphology evolution, spatial arrangement, and biomimetic strategies. These topologies modulate structure&#8208;property relationships across multiple scales, enabling performance enhancement and multifunctional integration. Insights into topology&#8208;guided optimization and growing applications in biosensing, health monitoring, energy harvesting, and disease treatment are provided, along with challenges for future research directions.








Abstract
Topology is fundamental in determining the properties and functions of biological piezoelectric materials by influencing service performances across multiple scales, from nanoscale molecular arrangements to macroscopic assembly structures. At each scale, topology governs electrical, mechanical, and biological behaviors, facilitating multifunctional integration and multi&#8208;field coupling advances. Recent progress demonstrates the potential of topological optimization to enhance piezoelectric coefficients and enable complex functionalities. Strategies such as multi&#8208;scale design, machine learning&#8208;guided optimization, and precision fabrication techniques are being explored to address persistent challenges, including limited energy conversion efficiency, long&#8208;term stability, and biocompatibility. Critical applications include health monitoring, biosensing, energy harvesting, and disease treatment, highlighting opportunities and unresolved technical bottlenecks. Future research directions are discussed to present theoretical insights and practical pathways to the development of biological piezoelectric materials.

         <title>Smart Self&#8208;Healing Anode/Electrolyte Interphases for Stabilizing Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In recent years, many researchers have attempted to develop ESAEIs or ISAEIs for stabilizing the Zn anode. ESAEIs can be divided into static ESAEIs and dynamic ESAEIs according to the evolution of ESAEIs during the cycling process, while ISAEIs include polymer&#8208;based ISAEIs and liquid metal&#8208;based ISAEIs according to the chemical composition.








Abstract
The rational design of Zn anode/electrolyte interphases (AEIs) is an effective strategy for regulating the Zn2+ stripping/plating process, as well as suppressing the interfacial side reactions. However, the formation of defects during the cycling process is still inevitable, and the exacerbation of defects would lead to the failure of the electrode, limiting the long&#8208;term stability of the Zn anode. In recent years, self&#8208;healing AEIs (SAEIs) have received great attention in Zn anode modification, as they can self&#8208;heal and suppress the defects. This review summarizes the latest progress of SAEIs for Zn anode, including extrinsic and intrinsic SAEIs. Specifically, the design strategies and self&#8208;healing mechanisms of SAEIs, their roles in stabilizing Zn anode, as well as the research methods for self&#8208;healing performance, are discussed in detail. In addition, the challenges for the research of SAEIs are also analyzed, and prospects for the future design and research of SAEIs for Zn anode are provided. This review is expected to guide the future development of high&#8208;performance SAEIs for Zn and other metal anodes.

         <title>Electrochemical Hydrogen Production Coupling with the Upgrading of Organic and Inorganic Chemicals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights the coupling of electrocatalytic H&#8322; production with the upgrading of organic and inorganic alternative chemicals. The optimization synthesis strategy, catalytic activity, and structure&#8211;performance relationships of various electrocatalysts are summarized, and relevant catalytic reaction mechanisms and electrolytic cell configuration in practical application scenarios are discussed. Finally, the remaining challenges and prospects are further proposed.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic water splitting powered by renewable energy is a green and sustainable method for producing high&#8208;purity H2. However, in conventional water electrolysis, the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) involves a four&#8208;electron transfer process with inherently sluggish kinetics, which severely limits the overall efficiency of water splitting. Recently, replacing OER with thermodynamically favorable oxidation reactions, coupled with the hydrogen evolution reaction, has garnered significant attention and achieved remarkable progress. This strategy not only offers a promising route for energy&#8208;saving H&#8322; production but also enables the simultaneous synthesis of high&#8208;value&#8208;added products or the removal of pollutants at the anode. Researchers successfully demonstrate the upgrading of numerous organic and inorganic alternatives through this approach. In this review, the latest advances in the coupling of electrocatalytic H2 production and the upgrading of organic and inorganic alternative chemicals are summarized. What's more, the optimization strategy of catalysts, structure&#8211;performance relationship, and catalytic mechanism of various reactions are well discussed in each part. Finally, the current challenges and future prospects in this field are outlined, aiming to inspire further innovative breakthroughs in this exciting area of research.

Material systems, device structures, and mechanisms of NPC effect&#8208;based devices are summarized for designing high&#8208;performance neuromorphic electronics. The evaluation parameters of the photoelectric properties, memory capabilities, and synaptic plasticity of optoelectronic devices are discussed for the realization of high&#8208;efficiency neuromorphic computing. Hardware and software operation of in&#8208;sensor computing for neuromorphic computing using NPC effect&#8208;based devices are systematically summarized to provide insights into future applications.

         <title>State&#8208;Of&#8208;The&#8208;Art Structural Regulation Methods and Quantum Chemistry for Carbon&#8208;Based Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts in Advanced Oxidation Process: Critical Perspectives into Molecular Level</title>

         <dc:description>
This review aims to provide comprehensive molecular&#8208;level insights regarding catalytic oxidation mechanisms by carbon&#8208;based SACs, especially the coupling of the &#8220;oxidants&#8208;catalysts&#8208;pollutants&#8221; internal molecular&#8208;level relationships. It is worth clarifying that all the molecular&#8208;level insights eventually are served for the development of scale&#8208;up engineering, which will satisfy the demand for actual wastewater.








Abstract
Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) by carbon&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are recognized as an attractive scientific frontier for water treatment, with the outstanding benefits of ultra&#8208;effective and anti&#8208;interference capability. However, most of the research has paid more attention to the performance of SACs, while the in&#8208;depth understanding of catalytic regulation by molecular interaction is relatively deficient. This critical review delves into deciphering the catalytic mechanism through a micro&#8208;level, which makes it more convenient to interpret apparent catalytic phenomena. It first summarizes basic theories of quantum chemistry, which provide mechanism interpretation and prediction for molecular&#8208;oxidation systems. Additionally, corresponding oxidation pathways of common oxidants are underscored. Following the oxidants, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art regulation methods are discussed with special attention to involved molecular interactions and pollutants. Particularly, the preliminary insights into the &#8220;oxidant&#8208;catalyst&#8208;pollutants&#8221; internal relationships are provided to help construct the SAC&#8208;AOP system from a molecular standpoint. Meanwhile, some cutting&#8208;edge laboratory devices and pilot&#8208;scale engineering are presented to illustrate the ultimate purpose of scientific molecular exploration. Eventually, relative challenges of SACs&#8208;AOPs upon the design of catalytic systems and investigation methods are provided. This review aims to promote the large&#8208;scale potential of SACs&#8208;based AOPs in practical water treatment by emphasizing the pivotal role of micro&#8208;insights.

         <title>Empowering Generalist Material Intelligence with Large Language Models</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review outlines how large language models drive the emergence of generalist materials intelligence by orchestrating data mining, property prediction, structure generation, synthesis planning, and autonomous experimentation. Through the agent&#8208;in&#8208;the&#8208;loop paradigm, LLMs actively unify materials ontology, simulation, synthesis, and characterization, enabling closed&#8208;loop, multimodal reasoning across the entire materials discovery cycle.








Abstract
Large language models (LLMs) are steering the development of generalist materials intelligence (GMI), a unified framework integrating conceptual reasoning, computational modeling, and experimental validation. Central to this framework is the agent&#8208;in&#8208;the&#8208;loop paradigm, where LLM&#8208;based agents function as dynamic orchestrators, synthesizing multimodal knowledge, specialized models, and experimental robotics to enable fully autonomous discovery. Drawing from a comprehensive review of LLMs&#8217; transformative impact across representative applications in materials science, including data extraction, property prediction, structure generation, synthesis planning, and self&#8208;driven labs, this study underscores how LLMs are revolutionizing traditional tasks, catalyzing the agent&#8208;in&#8208;the&#8208;loop paradigm, and bridging the ontology&#8208;concept&#8208;computation&#8208;experiment continuum. Then the unique challenges of scaling up LLM adoption are discussed, particularly those arising from the misalignment of foundation LLMs with materials&#8208;specific knowledge, emphasizing the need to enhance adaptability, efficiency, sustainability, interpretability, and trustworthiness in the pursuit of GMI. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that LLMs are not universally efficient. Their substantial resource demands and inconsistent performance call for careful deployment based on demonstrated task suitability. To address these realities, actionable strategies and a progressive roadmap for equitably and democratically implementing materials&#8208;aware LLMs in real&#8208;world practices are proposed.

         <title>Rational Design of Semiconducting Oligomer for Third Harmonic Generation Bioimaging of Ultradeep Brain Imaging with NIR&#8208;IIb Excitation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
With de novo design, semiconducting oligomers and their nanoparticles (NPs) exhibit unexpectedly efficient Third harmonic generation (THG) performances with NIR&#8208;IIb excitation and anti&#8208;photobleaching capability. With these advantages, semiconducting oligomer NPs achieve high&#8208;resolution in vivo THG angiography of the deep brain at a record&#8208;high depth of 1745 &#181;m with spatial resolution and good biocompatibility, thus opening new horizons for developing high&#8208;performance THG probes.








Abstract
Multiphoton microscopy (MPM) has unparalleled promise in high&#8208;spatiotemporal bioimaging within the tissue&#8208;transparent window of 1500 to 1700&#160;nm, commonly referred to as the near&#8208;infrared&#8208;IIb (NIR&#8208;IIb) region. However, so far, surprisingly few cases of non&#8208;fluorescent MPM probes have been&#160;reported, and their imaging performances are relatively limited. Herein, this study introduces a highly efficient third harmonic generation (THG) probe based on semiconducting oligomer derivatives (BTICs), which exhibit strong THG responses under NIR&#8208;IIb (1700&#160;nm) excitation. Leveraging halogen chemistry, semiconducting oligomers with varying halogen substitutions and nanoparticles (NPs)&#160;exhibit unexpectedly high THG performance across different aggregation states upon NIR&#8208;IIb excitation. The BTICs NPs exhibit a large THG conversion efficiency (1215&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;84 cm6 s2 photon&#8722;2) and exceptional resistance to photobleaching. Furthermore, the biocompatibility and in vivo THG angiography capabilities of BTICs NPs are validated, achieving the visualisation of deep&#8208;brain vasculature with unprecedented spatial resolution at a record&#8208;high imaging depth of 1745&#160;&#181;m. The pioneering exploitation of semiconducting oligomer&#8208;based THG probes establishes a new class of high&#8208;performance materials, enabling ultra&#8208;deep THG imaging of the&#160;brain and advancing the design of next&#8208;generation THG imaging platforms.

         <title>A Highly Adaptable Hydrogen Bond Re&#8208;Orientation (HyBRO) Strategy for Multiscale Vasculature Fabrication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel hydrogen bond re&#8208;orientation (HyBRO) strategy enables three&#8208;dimensional (3D) printing of vascular microchannel networks with high accuracy. By switching sacrificial material interactions with nonsolvents, HyBRO prevents swelling and deformation, enabling accurate hierarchical channels spanning a tenfold size range. The method accommodates diverse ink materials and produces vasculature exhibiting robust endothelial barrier function and ion&#8208;channel responses under shear stress.








Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional&#160;printing of microchannel networks mimicking native vasculature provides essential functions for biomedical applications. However, developing a highly &#8220;adaptable&#8221; technique &#8211; that can adjust to diverse materials choices, high shape accuracy, and broad size ranges &#8211; for producing physiologically responsive vasculature remains challenging. Here, an innovative hydrogen bond re&#8208;orientation (HyBRO) strategy for microchannel network fabrication is reported. By identifying interfacial instability of sacrificial material (SM) during embedding as a core limitation, this strategy prints the SM into an optimal &#8220;nonsolvent&#8221; to shape the desirable channel structure. In this process, the nonsolvent instantaneously switches the SM from forming hydrogen bonds with exterior water to forming interior linkages inside it. This transition protects the SM from external solvent &#8220;erosion&#8221; upon re&#8208;exposure to embedding material, inhibiting deformation. Consequently, this approach enables the creation of accurate (&gt;90%), multiscale (10&#8208;fold), hierarchical microchannel networks, accommodating accurate printing of a wide range of ink materials &#8211; extending from typical hydrophilic polymers into non&#8208;typical hydrophobic ones. Further biological tests demonstrate that HyBRO&#8208;produced vasculature recapitulates not only essential endothelial barrier function but also delicate ion&#8208;channel responses to varying shear stresses, highlighting its potential for engineering physiologically responsive vasculature in broad applications.

A multi&#8208;generational compositional design creates a printable low&#8208;loss dielectric composite that achieves over 16 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1. This breakthrough is enabled by thermal post&#8208;processing, which promotes templated crystallization in a polymer matrix from surface&#8208;modified particles, creating a &#8220;hetero&#8208;percolated network.&#8221; The resulting material is three dimensionally printed into heatsinks that perform as effectively as metallic heatsinks while being electrically insulative and &#160;transparent to radio frequency signals.








Abstract
As electronic devices become simultaneously more powerful and compact, thermal management is increasingly critical. Optimizing components like heatsinks is increasingly required, which has recently leveraged additive manufacturing. There is growing demand to move away from incumbent metallic materials for dielectric materials that are electrically insulative and &#160;transparent to radio frequency signals. Thermally conductive polymer composites containing phonon&#8208;conducting ceramics offer a low&#8208;density dielectric solution compatible with fused filament fabrication. However, these materials have struggled to exceed thermal conductivities of 4&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 due to challenging rheological flow effects at high filler volume fractions that prevent stable material extrusion. In this work, multi&#8208;generational compositional design is conducted to develop a printable low&#8208;loss dielectric composite that achieves over 16&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1, comparable to stainless steel. This breakthrough is enabled by thermal post&#8208;processing, which promote templated crystallization in a poly&#8208;lactic acid &#160;matrix from surface&#8208;modified boron nitride platelets, creating a &#8220;hetero&#8208;percolated network&#8221;. The resulting material is three dimensionally printed into heatsinks that perform as effectively as metallic heatsinks while being electrically insulative and RF transparent.

         <title>Superior Adhesion of Monolayer Amorphous Carbon to Copper</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The adhesion energy of monolayer amorphous carbon on copper substrate is 85&#160;J&#160;m&#8722;2, 13 times higher than that of graphene due to covalent&#8208;like bonding between the sp2 carbon structure to copper. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), near&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption (NEXAFS), and (density functional theory) DFT calculations are used to elucidate the structural and electronic interactions at the monolayer amorphous carbon&#8208;copper interface.









Abstract
The single&#8208;atom thickness of graphene holds great potential for device scaling, but its effectiveness as a thin metal&#8208;ion diffusion barrier in microelectronics and a corrosion barrier for plasmonic devices is compromised by weak van der Waals interactions with copper (Cu), leading to delamination issues. In contrast, monolayer amorphous carbon (MAC), a recently reported single&#8208;atom&#8208;thick carbon film with a disordered sp2 hybridized structure, demonstrates superior adhesion properties. This study reveals that MAC exhibits an adhesion energy of 85&#160;J&#160;m&#8722;2 on Cu, which is 13 times greater than that of graphene. This exceptional adhesion is attributed to the formation of covalent&#8208;like Cu&#9472;C bonds while preserving its sp2 structure, as evidenced by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and near&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further elucidate that the corrugated structure of MAC facilitates the hybridization of C 2pz orbitals with Cu 4s and 3dz2 orbitals, promoting strong bonding. These insights indicate that the amorphous structure of MAC significantly enhances adhesion while preserving its elemental composition, providing a pathway to improve the mechanical reliability and performance of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials on metal substrates in various technological applications.

         <title>Ligand Field&#8208;Induced Dual Active Sites Enhance Redox Potential of Nickel Hexacyanoferrate for Ammonium Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The work aims to explore the electrochemical performance and energy storage mechanism of nickel hexacyanoferrate (NiHCF) in ammonium ion batteries (AIBs). The effect of ligand field&#8208;induced dual active sites has been revealed for the first time. Ni atoms of NiHCF display electrochemical activity in AIBs. Additionally, Ni can balance the charge distribution and further enhance the redox potential.








Abstract
Enhancing the redox potential of cathode materials is vital for increasing the energy density of aqueous ammonium ion batteries (AIBs). Prussian blue analogues (PBAs), with their inherently high redox potentials and open frameworks, are promising candidates. However, further boosting their redox potential and understanding their NH4+ ion storage mechanisms remain critical challenges. In this work, a novel ligand field&#8208;induced dual active sites mechanism is introduced by incorporating Ni into the PBA framework, activating Ni as an additional redox center for NH4+ ion storage. The electron transfer from Ni to Fe within the Ni&#9472;N&#8801;C&#9472;Fe chain enhances the redox potential and electrochemical performance of nickel hexacyanoferrate (NiHCF). For the first time, the electrochemical activity of Ni is demonstrated in NiHCF during NH4+ ions intercalation and de&#8208;intercalation. NiHCF exhibits elevated redox potentials, superior rate performance, and robust cycling stability compared to iron hexacyanoferrate (FeHCF). Advanced characterization techniques and density functional theory calculations confirm the activation of Ni and the enhanced interaction between NH4+ ions and the framework. These findings provide new insights into the NH4+ ion storage mechanism of PBAs and offer a promising strategy for designing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathode materials for AIBs.

         <title>Inorganic Biomaterials Inducing Scaffolds Pre&#8208;Neuralization for Infarcted Myocardium Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, an innovative myocardial infarction repair strategy by creating a &#8220;pre&#8208;neuralized&#8221; scaffold that combines strontium silicate microparticles with neural stem cells (NSCs) is introduced. This scaffold exhibits neuroregulatory capabilities that facilitates myocardial repair and improves cardiac function in vivo by modulating genes linked to circadian rhythm, underscoring the strategic benefit of neural&#8208;induced regulation in tissue repair.








Abstract
Neural networks are found to play an important role in monitoring and coordinating cardiac physiological activities. However, the clinical use of neuroregulatory strategies for repairing infarcted myocardium, such as vagus nerve stimulation and pharmacological activation, confronts the challenges of managing stimulation signals and potential drug side effects. In this study, an innovative myocardial infarction repair strategy by creating a &#8220;pre&#8208;neuralized&#8221; scaffold that combines strontium silicate microparticles with neural stem cells (NSCs) is introduced. Strontium silicate promotes NSCs&#160;differentiation, resulting in a scaffold enriched with mature neurons. This scaffold exhibits neuroregulatory capabilities that enhance the maturation and synchronized contraction of cardiomyocytes, facilitating myocardial repair and improving cardiac function in vivo. The findings indicate that the pre&#8208;neuralized scaffold aids myocardial recovery by modulating genes linked to circadian rhythm, underscoring the strategic benefit of neural&#8208;induced regulation in tissue repair. In conclusion, this study presents a promising approach to repairing infarcted myocardium using inorganic biomaterial&#8208;induced scaffolds with neuromodulatory properties from the perspective of systemically physiological regulation. This work may offer a new perspective for addressing complex tissue and organ injuries.

         <title>Noninvasive Optogenetics Realized by iPSC&#8208;Derived Tentacled Carrier in Alzheimer's Disease Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling stem cell differentiation to produce functional vesicles offers a promising approach for novel delivery carriers. This study explores the differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into &#8216;tentacled&#8217; stem cells, utilizing their derived &#8216;tentacled&#8217; vesicles as functional carriers to facilitate non&#8208;invasive, enhanced optogenetic therapy, offering a novel therapeutic approach for Alzheimer's disease.








Abstract
Neural&#8208;activated optogenetics technique contributing to the &#8220;restart&#8221; of degenerative neurons offers hope for the treatment of several neurodegenerative diseases. However, the limitations of persistent invasiveness and inadequate repair of the pathological environment strongly hinder its further application. Here, a concept of differentiating stem cells is proposed to produce functional materials to enhance the therapeutic applicability of optogenetics. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are differentiated to generate the &#8220;tentacled&#8221; stem cells TenSCs.

&lt;p&gt;Controlling stem cell differentiation to produce functional vesicles offers a promising approach for novel delivery carriers. This study explores the differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into &#8216;tentacled&#8217; stem cells, utilizing their derived &#8216;tentacled&#8217; vesicles as functional carriers to facilitate non-invasive, enhanced optogenetic therapy, offering a novel therapeutic approach for Alzheimer's disease.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neural-activated optogenetics technique contributing to the &#8220;restart&#8221; of degenerative neurons offers hope for the treatment of several neurodegenerative diseases. However, the limitations of persistent invasiveness and inadequate repair of the pathological environment strongly hinder its further application. Here, a concept of differentiating stem cells is proposed to produce functional materials to enhance the therapeutic applicability of optogenetics. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are differentiated to generate the &#8220;tentacled&#8221; stem cells TenSCs. Their &#8220;tentacled&#8221; vesicles TenSCev, upon inheriting the biological functions of the parent cell, will possess both neural targeting capacity and pathological environment repair ability. Hence, TenSCev are utilized as functional carrier to deliver optogenetics elements for completely non-traumatic and controllable neuron activation, while also facilitating the comprehensive restoration of the pathological environment, thus effectively halted disease progression and significantly improved cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease or aged mice. Further, the concept of generating specialized biomaterials from differentiated stem cells as functional carriers holds the potential to broaden the applicability of various neuroregulatory techniques in the treatment of neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Influence of Ion Size on Structure and Redox Chemistry in Na&#8208;Rich and Li&#8208;Rich Disordered Rocksalt Battery Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The larger ion size of Na+ versus with Li+ has a pronounced impact on the intercalation chemistry of disordered rocksalt cathode materials. On charge, the disordered rocksalt structure is retained in Li2MnO2F but it is lost in Na2MnO2F resulting in extensive amorphization. The larger ion size also lowers the average voltage enabling higher capacities between equivalent voltage limits.








Abstract
Li&#8208;rich disordered rocksalts are promising next&#8208;generation cathode materials for Li&#8208;ion batteries. Recent reports have shown it is also possible to obtain Na&#8208;rich disordered rocksalts, however, it is currently poorly understood how the knowledge of the structural and redox chemistry translates from the Li&#8208;rich to the Na&#8208;rich analogs. Here, the properties of Li2MnO2F and Na2MnO2F are compared, which have different ion sizes (Li+ = 0.76 vs Na+ = 1.02 &#197;) but the same disordered rocksalt structure and stoichiometry. It is found that Na2MnO2F exhibits lower voltage Mn&#8208; and O&#8208;redox couples, opening access to a wider compositional range within the same voltage limits. Furthermore, the intercalation mechanism switches from predominantly single&#8208;phase solid solution behavior in Li2MnO2F to a two&#8208;phase transition in Na2MnO2F, accompanied by a greater decrease in the average Mn&#9472;O/F bond length. Li2MnO2F retains its long&#8208;range disordered rocksalt structure throughout the first cycle. In contrast, Na2MnO2F becomes completely amorphous during charge and develops a local structure characteristic of a post&#8208;spinel. This amorphization is partially reversible on discharge. The results show how the ion intercalation behavior of disordered rocksalts differs dramatically when changing from Li&#8208; to Na&#8208;ions and offers routes to control the electrochemical properties of these high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathodes.

         <title>Over Tenfold Increase in Current Amplification Due to Anisotropic Polymer Chain Alignment in Organic Electrochemical Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
How to boost the IDS output of an OECT? Anisotropic polymer alignment along the channel direction enables a 13&#8208;fold increase in IDS. Such channel engineering opens the door to unprecedented signal amplification (here gmL/Wd = 2 580&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1 with a PBTTT&#8208;backbone bearing single&#8208;ether side chains), faster ON/OFF switching, and improved stability for the next&#8208;generation bioelectronics.








Abstract
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are central to the development of highly sensitive (bio)sensors, energy&#8208;efficient neuromorphic devices, and high&#8208;precision electrophysiological monitoring systems. With growing interest in these strategic electronic devices, a novel PBTTT polymer bearing single&#8208;ether side chains (PBTTT&#8208;8O) in OECTs is investigated. Pristine isotropic non&#8208;aligned OECT performance matches state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art transconductance, highlighting the potential of single ethers for designing high&#8208;performance organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (OMIECs). Moreover, a 13&#215; enhancement of current output is achieved by anisotropic polymer chain alignment of PBTTT&#8208;8O, opening doors to unprecedented device sensitivity. Compared to pristine ones, aligned OECTs afford a 6&#215; increase in the normalized transconductance (gmL/Wd), reaching an unprecedented 2&#160;580&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1. Such improvement is mainly due to a gain in carrier mobility &#181;, as evidenced by four distinct methods. In addition, aligned OECTs exhibit faster doping front propagation, ON switching, and OFF switching compared to pristine ones. This study hence reports a versatile and easily transferable approach to concomitantly boost signal amplification and accelerate the response time of bioelectronic devices.

         <title>Intrinsically&#8208;Stretchable and Patternable Quantum Dot Color Conversion Layers for Stretchable Displays in Robotic Skin and Wearable Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intrinsically&#8208;stretchable, heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free quantum dot color conversion layers are produced via a versatile crosslinking strategy. The color conversion layers exhibit minimal backlight leakage under mechanical strain, support high&#8208;resolution patterning, and integrate seamlessly with micro&#8208;light&#8208;emitting diodes. Their incorporation in haptic&#8208;responsive robotic skin and wearable healthcare sensors highlights their potential for next&#8208;generation stretchable displays.








Abstract
Stretchable displays are essential components as signal outputs in next&#8208;generation stretchable electronics, particularly for robotic skin and wearable device technologies. Intrinsically&#8208;stretchable and patternable color conversion layers (CCLs) offer practical solutions for developing full&#8208;color stretchable micro&#8208;light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) displays. However, significant challenges remain in creating stretchable and patternable CCLs without backlight leakage under mechanical deformation. Here, a novel material strategy for stretchable and patternable heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free quantum dot (QD) CCLs, potentially useful for robotic skin and wearable electronics is presented. Through a versatile crosslinking technique, uniform and high&#8208;concentration QD loading in the elastomeric polydimethylsiloxane matrix without loss of optical properties is achieved. These CCLs demonstrate excellent color conversion capabilities with minimal backlight leakage, even under 50% tensile strain. Additionally, fine&#8208;pixel patterning process with resolutions up to 300 pixels per inch is compatible with the QD CCLs, suitable for high&#8208;resolution stretchable display applications. The integration of these CCLs with micro&#8208;LED displays is also demonstrated, showcasing their use in haptic&#8208;responsive robotic skin and wearable healthcare monitoring sensors. This study offers a promising material preparation methodology for stretchable QDs/polymer composites and highlights their potential for advancing flexible and wearable light&#8208;emitting devices.

         <dc:description>
Solution&#8208;processable deep&#8208;blue OLEDs are achieved by designing a linearly fully fused acceptor&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;type tetraborate emitter with intramoleuclar noncovalent interactions and highly distorted structure, since such emitter promots high color purity satisfying the BT.2020 standard and a fast reverse intersystem crossing rate. The nonsensitized solution&#8208;processed deep&#8208;blue device achieves the best performance among wet LEDs with CIEy &lt; 0.08.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processable organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) have attracted much attention from academia and industry because of their advantages such as low production cost and suitability for large&#8208;scale production. However, solution&#8208;processable deep&#8208;blue OLEDs that simultaneously have high efficiencies and satisfy the BT.2020 standard remain still a great challenge. To address this issue, here a tetraboron multiresonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitter, tBO&#8208;4B, embedded with two soluble 2,12&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;5,9&#8208;dioxa&#8208;13b&#8208;boranaphtho[3,2,1&#8208;de]anthracene groups is designed and synthesized with a linearly fully fused acceptor&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;type molecular structure. tBO&#8208;4B not only achieves an ultranarrow full width at half maximum of 12&#160;nm but also has a negligibly small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap and large spin&#8210;orbit coupling, eventually leading to very fast reverse intersystem crossing rate (4.23 &#215; 106 s&#8722;1). The sensitizer&#8208;free solution&#8208;processed OLED exploiting tBO&#8208;4B as the emitter achieves an ultrahigh maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 30.3%, with Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.147, 0.042) meeting the BT.2020 blue standard. In addition, the corresponding sensitizer&#8208;free vacuum&#8208;processed deep&#8208;blue devices also exhibit an impressive EQEmax of 39.6% and mild efficiency roll&#8208;off with CIE coordinates of (0.147, 0.043). This work will facilitate the development of high&#8208;efficiency ultrapure deep&#8208;blue MR&#8208;TADF materials for solution&#8208; and vacuum&#8208;processed OLEDs.

&lt;p&gt;Solution-processable deep-blue OLEDs are achieved by designing a linearly fully fused acceptor&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor-type tetraborate emitter with intramoleuclar noncovalent interactions and highly distorted structure, since such emitter promots high color purity satisfying the BT.2020 standard and a fast reverse intersystem crossing rate. The nonsensitized solution-processed deep-blue device achieves the best performance among wet LEDs with CIE&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; 0.08.

         <title>Charge Transport and Carrier Polarity Tuning by Electrolyte Gating in Nickel Benzenehexathiol Coordination Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reveals that charge transport in nickel benzenehexathiol coordination nanosheets is governed by variable&#8208;range hopping reflecting structural disorder. Electrolyte gating induces a switch in dominant carrier polarity from p&#8208;type to n&#8208;type and leads to an improvement in thermoelectric performance.








Abstract
Coordination nanosheets (CONASHs) or conjugated metal organic frameworks (MOFs) with distinctive metal&#8208;organic bonding structures exhibit promise for electronics, sensing, and energy storage. Porous Nickel&#8208;Benzene hexathiol complex (Ni&#8208;BHT) with noteworthy conductivity was first reported a decade ago, and recent synthetic modifications produced non&#8208;porous Ni&#8208;BHT with enhanced conductivity (&#8776;50 S cm&#8722;1). Here the charge transport physics of such non&#8208;porous Ni&#8208;BHT films are studied with even higher conductivity (&#8776;112 S cm&#8722;1). In contrast to the thermally activated electrical conductivity, thermoelectric measurements suggest an intrinsic metallic nature of Ni&#8208;BHT. It is shown that it is possible to tune the Fermi level and carrier polarity in Ni&#8208;BHT by electrolyte gating; gating is initially governed by the formation of an interfacial, electric double layer and then evolves into an electrochemical (de)doping process. These findings not only contribute to a deeper understanding of charge transport in CONASHs, but also show that Fermi level tuning is an effective approach for enhancing the thermoelectric performance of CONASHs.

         <title>Tailored Design of Mesoporous Metal Organic Framework Single Crystals by Kinetics&#8208;Mediated Micelle Assembly for Efficient Asymmetrical Single&#8208;Atom Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a kinetics&#8208;mediated micelle assembly strategy is established for the controllable synthesis of mesoporous MOFs (MesoMOFs) with diverse compositions and mesophases. The customizable meso&#8208; and micro&#8208;environment enables the creation of a new class of mesoporous asymmetric single&#8208;atom catalysts rich in catalytically accessible CoN3O sites, with enhanced localized electrons around Co center and upshifted d&#8208;band center, for efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).








Abstract
Constructing mesoporous metal organic frameworks (MesoMOFs) with customizable meso&#8208; and micro&#8208;environment is pivotal for asymmetric single&#8208;atom catalysis, yet it is impeded by the strong self&#8208;growth tendency of MOFs. In this work, a novel kinetics&#8208;mediated micelle assembly strategy is introduced to realize the general fabrication of mesoporous zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) single crystals. Spectroscopic characterizations and cryo&#8208;electron cryomicroscopy reveal that the strategic use of water accelerates the MOFs kinetics&#8208;mediated micelle assembly via enhancing ligand deprotonation, which suppresses the MOFs self&#8208;growth, facilitating the cooperative assembly of micelles and MOFs. Furthermore, the water amount can modulate the Flory&#8208;Huggins interaction parameters between the solvents and micelles, thereby precisely controlling the pore architectures from spherical, cylindrical to vesicular. Such versatile synthesis creates a new class of mesoporous asymmetric CoN3O single&#8208;atom catalyst. Synchrotron spectral characterizations and theoretical calculations uncover that this asymmetric geometry localizes more electrons around Co center and upshift the d&#8208;band center, stabilizing O* intermediates and promoting the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Consequently, the asymmetric mesoporous catalyst exhibits a half&#8208;wave potential (0.91&#160;V in alkaline media) and a high power density (185&#160;mW cm&#8722;2) in a zinc&#8208;air battery. This work provides a new approach for designing MesoMOFs for asymmetric single&#8208;atom catalysis.

         <title>Metal Halide Perovskite&#8208;Gated Organic Phototransistors for Efficient UV/DUV Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite&#8208;gated phototransistors (PGPTs) using wide&#8208;bandgap metal halide perovskites (MHPs) as dual&#8208;function dielectric and photoresponsive layers are introduced. By decoupling photoresponse and charge transport, the PGPTs achieve exceptional UV/DUV detection performance at low operating voltages, with scalability and material flexibility. This innovative approach offers a cost&#8208;effective, versatile platform for advanced photodetectors, enabling applications in telecommunications, imaging, and solar&#8208;blind detection.








Abstract
Conventional UV/DUV phototransistors, which rely on wide&#8208;bandgap semiconductor channels, encounter issues with material availability, processing complexity, and performance tunability. Perovskite&#8208;gated phototransistors (PGPTs) are introduced that decouple photoresponse and charge transport by using wide&#8208;bandgap metal halide perovskites (MHPs) as dielectric layers and non&#8208;wide&#8208;bandgap semiconductors as channels. This design offers material flexibility, simplified processing, and enhanced performance. Using the 2D Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper perovskite PEA2PbBr4 (Eg&#160;=&#160;3.0&#160;eV) as the dielectric layer and the organic semiconductor (OSC) P3HT as the channel layer, UV phototransistors are successfully achieved with exceptional photodetection performance at operating voltages below 2&#160;V, exhibiting a responsivity of 1960&#160;mA&#160;W&#8722;1, a specific detectivity of 3&#160; &#215; &#160;1011 Jones, and a response time of &#8776;20&#160;ms. Fabricated via low&#8208;temperature (&#8804;100 &#176;C) solution processing, this approach facilitates scalable production and is adaptable to various OSCs and other wide&#8208;bandgap MHP dielectrics, such as PEA2PbCl4 (Eg&#160;=&#160;3.6&#160;eV) and PEA2SnI4 (Eg&#160;=&#160;3.8&#160;eV), extending their potential for DUV detection. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, an optical decoder for telecommunications is demonstrated using DUV PEA2PbCl4/PDVT&#8208;10 PGPTs, which are immune to ambient light interference. Additionally, these DUV phototransistors show potential for latent fingerprint detection due to their sensitivity to skin absorption characteristics.

         <title>Nonvolatile Electric Control of Ferromagnetism in Van Der Waals Multiferroic Heterostructures at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents the first demonstration of the nonvolatile ferroelectric polarization modulation of magnetic domains in van der Waals multiferroic Fe3GaTe2/CuInP2S6 heterostructures at ambient conditions, which is primarily attributed to the ferroelectric polarization&#8208;controlled Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction.








Abstract
Multiferroic heterostructures offer a promising platform for next&#8208;generation low&#8208;power spintronic devices by enabling electric&#8208;field control of magnetism. While recent advances in two&#8208;dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) magnetic and ferroelectric materials have sparked significant interest, achieving reliable and nonvolatile electrical modulation of magnetism at room temperature within vdW multiferroic heterostructures remains a substantial challenge. Here, this study demonstrates robust, reproducible, and nonvolatile electrical control of ferromagnetism in Fe3GaTe2/CuInP2S6 multiferroic heterostructures under ambient conditions. The modulation is evidenced macroscopically by reshaped magnetic hysteresis loops in anomalous Hall voltage measurements and microscopically by in situ magnetic and electric field&#8208;induced domain evolution captured via magnetic force microscopy. The first&#8208;principles calculations reveal that the polarization of CuInP2S6 induces a significant modulation of the Dzyaloshinskii&#8208;Moriya interaction (DMI) in Fe3GaTe2. Incorporating these effects into micromagnetic simulations reproduces key features of the experimental hysteresis behaviors, indicating that the polarization&#8208;enhanced DMI lowers domain wall formation energy and drives a transition from coherent to incoherent magnetic reversal. These findings not only surmount the challenge of electrically modulating ferromagnetism in vdW systems via remanent ferroelectric polarization at room temperature but also open new pathways for energy&#8208;efficient skyrmion manipulation and vdW spintronic device engineering.

         <title>Protein&#8208;Nonfouling and Cell&#8208;Binding Polysulfobetaine Inducing Fast Transcytosis for Tumor&#8208;Active Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modulation of the N&#8208;alkyl chain length in polysulfobetaine&#8208;based zwitterionic micelles enables precise tuning of nanocarrier interactions with proteins and cell membranes. The optimized micelles comprising&#160;poly(sulfobetaine methacrylate)&#8208;block&#8208;poly(&#603;&#8208;caprolactone) with N&#8208;butyl substituent (PSB4&#8208;PCL), which are protein&#8208;resistant yet cell membrane&#8208;philic, achieve a unique balance between prolonged circulation and efficient tumor transcytosis, leading to enhanced intratumoral accumulation, deep penetration, and potent antitumor efficacy.








Abstract
Long blood circulation and fast cellular uptake are essential yet paradoxical requirements for efficient tumor&#8208;targeted drug delivery carriers. For instance, polyzwitterions, generally nonfouling to proteins and cells, have been extensively explored as long&#8208;circulating drug delivery carriers but suffer ultraslow cell internalization, making them inefficient in delivering drugs to cells. Protein&#8208;resistant yet cell membrane&#8208;binding polymers will simultaneously achieve long blood circulation and fast cellular internalization, but their designs are generally complicated, such as introducing cell&#8208;membrane binding groups. Here, it is shown that the N&#8208;alkyl chain length of zwitterionic poly(sulfobetaine) can be used to tune its affinity toward proteins and cell membranes. A poly(sulfobetaine) with a moderately long N&#8208;alkyl chain became cell membrane&#8208;philic while retaining protein resistance, leading to long blood circulation and fast cellular uptake, which further triggered efficient tumor cell transcytosis and intratumor penetration. Thus, its paclitaxel (PTX)&#8208;loaded micelles demonstrated potent antitumor efficacy in triple&#8208;negative breast cancer models. This study showcases a paradigm of designing polyzwitterions harmonizing long blood circulation and fast cellular uptake properties as tumor&#8208;active drug delivery carriers.

         <title>Atomistic Mechanisms of the Crystallographic Orientation&#8208;Dependent Cu1.8S Conductive Channel Formation in Cu2S&#8208;Based Memristors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compliance current can be utilized to control the volatile and nonvolatile resistive switching behaviors of &#947;&#8208;Cu2S, which results from the &#947;&#8208; to &#946;&#8208;Cu2S phase transition and orientation&#8208;dependent formation (along &#947;&#8208;Cu2S [201]) of high&#8208;digenite Cu1.8S conductive channels, respectively. The Cu1.8S channels form from an intermediate &#948;&#8208;Cu2S phase through the directional Cu+ migration along &#948;&#8208;Cu2S [001].








Abstract
Achieving multiple types of resistive switching in a single material with controlled ionic motion is a key challenge in neuromorphic computing, traditionally addressed by combining materials with distinct switching behaviors. Here, Cu2&#8208;xS is identified as a promising candidate to overcome this limitation due to its hierarchical phase transitions. Using in situ biasing experiments, reversible and non&#8208;reversible phase transitions (and resistive switching) are demonstrated in &#947;&#8208;Cu2S by controlling the compliance current. The formation of parallel high&#8208;digenite Cu1.8S channels, orientated along the &#947;&#8208;Cu2S [201] crystallographic direction, drives the nonvolatile resistive switching. These channels emerge via an intermediate &#948;&#8208;Cu2S phase and are stabilized at room temperature by residual strains, alongside &#946;&#8208;Cu2S phase. The work clarifies the complex, electrically triggered phase transformations in &#947;&#8208;Cu2S, and highlights the potential of Cu2&#8208;xS as a versatile material for neuromorphic computing.

         <title>Flexible Selenium Nanowires with Tuneable Electronic Bandgaps</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanotubes serve as effective test tubes for selenium nanowires, as their diameter precisely controls the width of the nanowires and the Se&#9472;Se bonding, resulting in a variety of different structures. An electron beam can be used to modify the nanotubes, allowing real&#8208;time observation of the nanowire extrusion process. Additionally, optically transparent boron nitride nanotubes enable direct bandgap measurements for individual nanowires, revealing the interplay between various phenomena occurring at the nanoscale.








Abstract
Manipulating semiconductor properties without altering their chemical composition holds promise for electronic and optical materials. However, linking atomic positions in nanomaterials to their functional properties is challenging due to their polydispersity. This study utilizes nano test tubes to uncover distinct phases of selenium, an elemental semiconductor, demonstrating a remarkable structural plasticity between 0.4 and 3.0 nm. These structures are correlated with their electronic bandgaps, ranging from 2.2 to 2.5 eV, using ultra&#8208;low&#8208;loss electron energy loss spectroscopy and aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy for individual nanowires in boron nitride nanotubes (BNNT). Notably, the variation in bandgaps diverges from that of bulk selenium and is non&#8208;monotonic on the host&#8208;nanotube diameter, indicating that conformational distortions in selenium chains begin counteracting quantum confinement effects at sub&#8208;nm scales. A 1D phase diagram predicting selenium's atomic structure based on nanotube diameter, regardless of the chemistry of the host nanotube is developed, which can be BNNT or carbon nanotubes. Phase changes in selenium nanowires are imaged in real&#8208;time by transmission electron microscopy using BNNT as a test tube with an adjustable diameter. These nanoscale findings pave the way for the development of advanced miniature tuneable and flexible electronic components, including transistors, optical sensors, and photovoltaics.

         <title>An Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress&#8208;Specific Nanoinducer Selectively Evokes Type&#8208;II Immunogenic Cell Death for Pyroptotic Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops a pH/cathepsin dual&#8208;gated nanoplatform (PCANER) enabling tumor&#8208;responsive, precise endoplasmic reticulum (ER) delivery of photosensitizers to induce type&#8208;II immunogenic cell death and pyroptosis. With 83% ER&#8208;targeted efficacy, PCANER promotes glucose&#8208;regulated protein 78/calreticulin exposure and reprograms the tumor immune microenvironment, establishing a subcellular organelle&#8208;targeted immunomodulation paradigm for cancer therapy.








Abstract
Specific induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress&#8208;initiated type&#8208;II immunogenic cell death (ICD) shows great potential in boosting tumor immunogenicity and anti&#8208;tumor immunotherapy. However, it remains challenging to selectively provoke type&#8208;II ICD, due to the lack of highly efficient ER targeting strategy. Here, a pH/Cathepsin&#8208;Activatable Nanoplatform (PCAN) is reported to specifically photo&#8208;induce ER stress (PCANER) and type&#8208;II ICD for cancer immunotherapy. PCANER integrates the long&#8208;circulating properties of nanomedicines with pH/cathepsin B dual&#8208;gated design, exhibiting excellent ER targeting with a colocalization efficacy of 83% in cancer tissues. Through directly intensifying glucose&#8208;regulated protein 78 and calreticulin exposure, PCANER augments type&#8208;II ICD and pyroptotic cancer cell death with high immune priming to cascade&#8208;amplify the cancer&#8208;immunity cycle, while the mild type&#8208;I ICD induced by lysosome stress (PCANLy) exhibits negligible antitumor efficacy. By leveraging the spatiotemporal subcellular organelle targeting of PCAN technology, this study achieves precise tuning of the type of ICD and cellular pyroptosis&#8208;based cancer therapy. This study offers new insights into the design of organelle level&#8208;targeted nanomedicines, paving the way for dissecting and modulating the cell death mechanism to boost cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>A Kagome Metallic Composite Realizes Mechanically Axial Zero Thermal Expansion up to 800 K</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kagome metallic composite is used to prepare high&#8208;strength two&#8208;phase zero thermal expansion alloys. By in situ precipitation of the plastic &#945;&#8208;(Fe/Co) phase yields zero thermal expansion alloys with ultra&#8208;wide temperature windows and excellent compressive strength. This method can be extended to other Fe&#8208;based negative thermal expansion systems for high performance in the future.








Abstract
Manipulating the crystal structure and microstructure is fundamentally paramount for designing advanced materials with enhanced functionalities. Kagome&#8208;lattice metals attracted considerable attention due to desirable electronic and magnetic properties but are rarely considered for application as structural materials. In this study, a concept of kagome composite is proposed to realize mechanically zero thermal expansion (ZTE) alloy over a wide temperature window, exemplified by the Lu&#8208;Fe&#8208;Co ternary alloys prepared by two&#8208;step synthesis. Using magnetic Co doping, the kagome lattice magnetic order is stabilized in the parent hexagonal Lu2Fe17 structure, and its thermal expansion regulated simultaneously. By in situ precipitation of the &#945;&#8208;(Fe/Co) phase in the matrix, a soft/hard heterogeneous structure emerges and an ultra&#8208;wide temperature window axial ZTE composite (&#945;l = +0.98 &#215; 10&#8722;6 K&#8722;1, 110&#8211;800 K) with good compressive strength (1.11&#160;GPa) is achieved. This work opens up the prospect of kagome intermetallic composite in the integration of structure and function.

         <title>Engineering Cellular Self&#8208;Adhesions Inside 3D Printed Micro&#8208;Arches to Enhance Cell:Biomaterial Attachment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surprisingly, a cell can bind to itself to make a self&#8208;adhesion, which engineered here to improve how cells attach to biomaterials. Nanoprinting are used to make 3D structures smaller than cells&#8211;called Self&#8208;Adhesion&#8208;Tunnels (SATs)&#8211;around which cells can wrap and bind to themselves. These self&#8208;adhesions improve cell attachment stability and offer a new approach for biomaterial design.








Abstract
A cell can bind to itself and form a self&#8208;adhesion that can be engineered and harnessed as a new way to adhere cells to engineered materials&#8211;a key challenge for biomaterials are demonstrated. Here, a 3D structure smaller is developed than a single cell, that a Self&#8208;Adhesion&#8208;Tunnel (SAT) is called, that causes cells to wrap around it and bind to themselves. This process is driven through the cadherin proteins that regulate cell&#8208;cell adhesion, and it is shown that many of the key elements of a normal cell&#8208;cell adhesion are found in self&#8208;adhesions. Size and shape of the SAT determine the efficiency of&#160;self&#8208;adhesion&#160;formation, and &gt;90% efficient formation of self&#8208;adhesions are observed in both kidney and skin cells per SAT. Self&#8208;adhesions can persist for at least 24&#160;hrs and act to stabilize the cell&#8208;material interface and reduce migration. Overall, this ability to co&#8208;opt the native cell&#8208;cell adhesion machinery in cells and use it as an attachment strategy can provide new approaches for soft&#8208;tissue implant integration and tissue engineering scaffolds where stable tissue&#8208;material interfaces are critical.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Agent&#8208;Network&#8208;Based Idea Generator for Zinc&#8208;Ion Battery Electrolyte Discovery: A Case Study on Zinc Tetrafluoroborate Hydrate&#8208;Based Deep Eutectic Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An LLM&#8208;based multi&#8208;agent network screens academic literature to propose multiple environmentally friendly aqueous deep eutectic electrolytes for zinc&#8208;ion batteries. Experiments identify an optimal composition of Zn(BF4)2&#183;xH2O and ethylene carbonate, which shows high conductivity and cycling stability. Spectroscopy and simulations confirm corrosion suppression and stable solid electrolyte interphases, establishing an AI&#8208;driven paradigm for electrolyte discovery.








Abstract
Aqueous deep eutectic electrolytes (DEEs) offer great potential for low&#8208;cost zinc&#8208;ion batteries but often have limited performance. Discovering new electrolytes is therefore crucial, yet time&#8208;consuming and resource&#8208;intensive. In response, this work presents a Large Language Model (LLM)&#8208;based multi&#8208;agent network that proposes DEE compositions for zinc&#8208;ion batteries. By analyzing academic papers from the DEE field, the network identifies innovative, inexpensive, and sustainable Lewis bases to pair with Zn(BF4)2&#183;xH2O. A Zn(BF4)2&#183;xH2O&#8208;ethylene carbonate (EC) system demonstrates high conductivity (10.6 mS cm&#8722;1) and a wide electrochemical stability window (2.37&#160;V). The optimized electrolyte enables stable zinc stripping/plating, achieves outstanding rate performance (81 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 A g&#8722;1), and supports 4000 cycles in Zn||polyaniline cells at 3 A g&#8722;1. Spectroscopic analyses and simulations reveal that EC coordinates to Zn2+, mitigating water&#8208;induced corrosion, while a fluorine&#8208;rich hybrid organic/inorganic solid electrolyte interphase enhances stability. This work showcases a pioneering LLM&#8208;driven approach to electrolyte development, establishing a new paradigm in materials research.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Researchers developed ultra&#8208;stable near&#8208;infrared perovskite LEDs with peak external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of &#8776;24.7% and EQEs of &gt;20% from 70 to 1200 mA cm&#8722;2, resulting in an ultra&#8208;high peak radiance of 2270&#8201;W&#8201;sr&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2. Furthermore, these PeLEDs exhibit outstanding operational stability at high current densities. The high stability is enabled by a multifunctional stabilizer containing formamidine groups, which prevent phase transition and decomposition of the &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 perovskite under elevated temperatures.








Abstract
Perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) have emerged as a promising candidate for next&#8208;generation display technologies, owing to their high efficiency and color purity. However, the operational instability of PeLEDs at high current densities (&gt;100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) remains a significant challenge. Here, near&#8208;infrared (&#8776;797&#160;nm) PeLEDs are reported with peak external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of &#8776;24.7% and EQEs of &gt;20% across a wide range of current densities (70&#8211;1200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2), resulting in an ultra&#8208;high peak radiance of 2270&#8201;W&#8201;sr&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2. These PeLEDs exhibit outstanding operational stability with operational lifetimes (T50) of 6.6, 12.7, 19.2, 49.5, 238.6, and 350&#160;h at current densities of 500, 400, 300, 200, 100, and 50&#8201;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively. The high stability is enabled by a multifunctional stabilizer containing formamidine groups, which prevent phase transition and decomposition of the &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 perovskite under elevated temperatures. This work demonstrates the feasibility of achieving efficient and stable PeLEDs at high current densities, providing strategies for the development of high&#8208;power optoelectronic devices based on halide perovskites.

         <title>Eliminating Positive Aging in Quantum Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes by H2O&#8208;Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By intentionally introducing H2O to treat the ZnMgO and post&#8208;annealing the devices, the ZnMgO defects can be fully passivated soon after the devices are fabricated. The developed in situ H2O treatment strategy, which enables the realization of high performance QLEDs and the elimination of uncontrollable positive aging, could promote the industrialization process of QLEDs.








Abstract
Quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs) usually exhibit a positive aging phenomenon with their efficiency and brightness increase after storage for several days. Although positive aging enhances device performance, its random and uncontrollable process presents substantial challenges for QLED industrialization. Here, It is identified that the H2O, produced by the reaction between the acidic resin and ZnMgO, can slowly passivate the defects of ZnMgO and is thus responsible for the positive aging. By intentionally introducing H2O to treat the ZnMgO and post&#8208;annealing the devices, the ZnMgO defects can be fully passivated soon after the devices are fabricated. As a result, the fresh devices exhibit a high efficiency of 55.2&#160;lm W&#8722;1 (26%), which is 2.04 (1.67)&#8208;fold higher than those of untreated devices and 1.21 (1.02)&#8208;fold higher than those of untreated devices after positive aging. Moreover, the performance of the treated devices remains very stable even after storage for several days, indicating the undesired positive aging is completely eliminated. The developed in situ H2O treatment strategy, which enables the realization of high performance QLEDs and the elimination of uncontrollable positive aging, can promote the industrialization process of QLEDs.

         <title>Ultralight and Elastic Polyimide Microtube Aerogel via Airflow&#8208;Induced Spinning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper reports the one&#8208;step preparation of ultralight polyimide microtube aerogel sponges (PMAS) using airflow&#8208;induced spinning. PMAS has ultralow density, excellent thermal insulation properties and compression resilience over a wide temperature range, and can be applied in thermal insulation. Notably, airflow&#8208;induced spinning technology fills the gaps in industrial&#8208;scale preparation and material compatibility of microtube.








Abstract
Flexible thermal protection is of great significance in fields facing various environments such as aerospace and electric vehicles. Elastic aerogels with micro&#8208;nanofibers as the base unit effectively solve the force&#8208;thermal compatibility, optimized the contradiction between mechanical strength and thermal insulation performance, and solves the risk of fragile aerogel. In order to develop elastic aerogels with lower density and better thermal insulation properties. Here, the first one&#8208;step preparation of ultralight polyimide microtube aerogel sponges (PMAS) using airflow&#8208;induced spinning is reported. PMAS consists of a large number of structurally controllable microtube, resulting in ultralight density (&#8776;50&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;3), ultralow thermal conductivity (37&#160;mW&#160;m&#8722;1&#183;K at 25&#160;&#176;C), and excellent elasticity and fatigue resistance, with no significant attenuation of the maximum stress after 1000 cycles of compression at 80% strain. In addition, PMAS has temperature&#8208;invariant dynamic mechanical stability and an operating temperature range from 77 to 573 K. These superior properties enable PMAS to be ideal choice for thermal insulation in extreme environments, thermal runaway in batteries, adsorption and gas filling. Airflow&#8208;induced spinning fills the gap in the industrial&#8208;scale preparation and material compatibility of microtube, while also providing a promising solution for the universal preparation of microtube structures.

         <title>Hybridizing Electrode Interface Structures in Protonic Ceramic Cells for Durable, Reversible Hydrogen and Power Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>

A hybrid oxygen electrode combining PrOx nanoparticles with a PrNi0.7Co0.3O3&#8211;&#948; (PNC) backbone significantly boosts PCEC performance, achieving a current density of 2.25&#160;A&#160;cm&#8315;2 at 1.30&#160;V in electrolysis mode and a Faradaic efficiency of 96.8%. This approach enhances catalytic activity and stability, advancing scalable solutions for clean energy conversion.








Abstract
Protonic ceramic electrochemical cells (PCECs) represent a transformative technology for sustainable hydrogen production and power generation by converting energy between chemical and electrical forms. Operating at intermediate temperatures, PCECs utilize proton&#8208;conducting electrolytes, achieving high efficiency and reduced degradation. However, a major bottleneck lies at the oxygen electrode due to sluggish kinetics and limited active sites. To address this, we present a hybrid oxygen electrode featuring PrNi0.7Co0.3O3&#8211;&#948; (PNC) backbone infused with oxygen vacancy&#8208;rich praseodymium oxide (PrOx) nanoparticles. This design leverages the interplay between surface and bulk properties to enhance oxygen adsorption, diffusion, and catalytic kinetics. The PrOx introduces abundant oxygen vacancies and modulates the d&#8208;band center for optimal adsorption energy, while the PNC backbone provides robust proton conduction and stabilizes reaction intermediates. Cells incorporating this hybrid electrode demonstrate a peak power density of 1.56 W cm&#8722;2 at 600 &#176;C in fuel cell mode and a current density of 2.25 A cm&#8722;2 at 1.30 V in electrolysis mode. Faradaic and energy efficiency reach 96.8% and 89.9%, respectively, with exceptional thermal cycling stability and reduced polarization resistance (0.079 &#937; cm2). This study underscores the potential of advanced electrode architectures to enhance the efficiency, durability, and applicability of PCECs in renewable energy systems.

         <title>Origami Silicon Anodes: Geometric Design for Structural Elasticity and Connectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The origami&#8208;capsule silicon anode materials, synthesized via a magnesiothermic crystallization approach, integrate elastic 2D nanosheets (2.5&#160;nm) with built&#8208;in nanopores encapsulated in a pressure&#8208;tolerant carbon shell. This architecture ensures structural resilience, efficient ion transport, and stress&#8208;resistant integrity, achieving high capacity (2945 mAh g&#8315;1), ultralow swelling (14.7%), and 100% capacity retention at 6 A g&#8315;1 over 470 cycles.








Abstract
Achieving stable cycling of high&#8208;capacity battery electrodes with large volume changes remains a significant challenge, with their mechanical failure and sluggish kinetics, primarily due to inadequate structural accommodation and inefficient transport pathways. Here, a magnesiothermic crystallization approach is presented to construct origami capsule (OC) architectures, imparting flexibility and conformability to inherently brittle silicon, featuring highly interconnected 2D silicon nanosheets (2.5&#160;nm thickness) with built&#8208;in nanopores encapsulated within a pressure&#8208;tolerant conformal microshell. The design leverages geometric features at both the nanoscale (within nanosheets) and microscale (capsule assembly) to impart structural elasticity and connectivity for efficient stress dissipation, enhancing mechanical integrity and rapid transport kinetics. Consequently, the OC anode exhibits low electrode swelling (14.7%) at 2945 mAh g&#8722;1 and exceptional rate capability, delivering a high capacity and &#8776;100% retention after 470 cycles at a large current density of 6 A g&#8722;1. This work bridges geometric design and materials science, opening new avenues for high&#8208;performance energy storage solutions.

         <title>Interface Modification of Single Atom&#8208;Nanocluster Synergistic Sites to Break the Activity&#8208;Selectivity&#8208;Stability Trade&#8208;Off in Selective Hydrogenations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interfacial modification strategy is introduced to precisely tailor the interface and electronic structure of palladium single atoms and clusters (Pd1+Pdn) synergistic sites. Catalytic experiments and spectroscopic characterization revealed site&#8208;specific adsorption&#8211;desorption behaviors and interface&#8208;enhanced H&#8208;spillover capacities on NC&#8208;modified Pd1+Pdn synergistic sites, thus achieving remarkable enhancements in activity, selectivity, and stability for selective hydrogenation reactions.








Abstract
Synergistic sites (M1+Mn) integrating single atoms (M1) and clusters (Mn) exhibit tremendous promise for overcoming linear scaling relationships. However, metal entities spatial segregation within synergistic sites impedes the overall optimization and structure&#8208;property analysis, and the support interface of the M1 and Mn sites critical for intermediate adsorption&#8208;transfer kinetics has yet unexplored. Here, for the first time, interfacial modification strategy is proposed to modulate the interface and electronic structure of M1+Mn sites. This is systematically altered that the interface of Pd1+Pdn sites from hydroxyapatite (HAP) to nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;modified HAP (NC/HAP) and pure NC, with all sites maintaining the comparable size and content. In the semi&#8208;hydrogenation of alkynes, volcano&#8208;type correlations between Pd1+Pdn sites with varying interfaces and hydrogenation activities are observed, peaking for those supported on NC/HAP. The obtained Pd1+Pdn@NC/HAP exhibits superior activity for alkynol&#8208;to&#8208;enol conversion, achieving a formation rate up to 3707.7&#160;mol molPd&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 while maintaining 97.2% selectivity. Comprehensive investigations propose d&#8208;band center of Pd1+Pdn sites with different interfaces as a descriptor to elucidate the volcano&#8208;type correlation for various selective hydrogenation reactions. Interfacial modification of Pd1+Pdn sites can optimize their electronic structure, adeptly managing substrates adsorption&#8211;desorption kinetic and interface H&#8208;spillover between segregated metal sites, thereby breaking &#8722;the activity&#8208;selectivity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off.

         <title>Highly Specific Cytokine Receptor&#8208;Targeting Chimeras for Targeted Membrane Protein Degradation and Sensitization of Osimertinib in EGFR&#8208;Mutated Non&#8208;Small&#8208;Cell Lung Cancer</title>

CXCR7&#8208;targeting chimeras (AP&#8208;CRTACs), which are constructed by covalently linking a membrane protein&#8208;targeting aptamer with a mutant&#8208;CXCL12 mimic peptide, can specifically harness the scavenge receptor CXCR7 to direct membrane proteins of interest (POIs) to the lysosome for degradation, while eliminating the effects of CXCL12 on its another receptor CXCR4 activation and tumor cell viability.








Abstract
The ability of cytokine receptors to mediate the internalization of targets in lysosomes positions them as specific and effective effectors for protein degradation strategies. However, challenges remain, including the potential unintended activation of cell&#8208;proliferation&#8208;related cytokine receptors, as well as limitations in programmability and structural flexibility of protein degradators. In this work, a CXCR7&#8208;targeting chimera (AP&#8208;CRTAC) that functions as a CXCR7 inducer by covalently linking a membrane protein&#8208;targeting aptamer with a mutant&#8208;CXCL12 mimic peptide is developed. This peptide selectively binds to CXCR7 without activating CXCR4. The AP&#8208;CRTAC, which incorporates various aptamer forms from DNA, RNA, or even bispecific aptamers, has shown significant efficacy in degrading one or more proteins or protein mutants on the cell surface. Moreover, the AP&#8208;CRTAC constructed with a 2&#8242; F&#8208;pyrimidine&#8208;modified RNA aptamer targeting EGFR effectively degrades various EGFR activating mutations. Notably, AP&#8208;CRTAC enhances the sensitivity of the L858R/T790M/C797S triple mutant lung cancer cells, which are resistant to current EGFR&#8208;targeted therapies, to the third&#8208;generation EGFR inhibitor osimertinib in both in vitro and in vivo settings. This research introduces an engineered CXCR7 inducer with high specificity and programmability for the targeted degradation of cell surface proteins, while minimizing unwanted side effects.

         <title>Atomic Scale Engineering of Multivalence&#8208;State Palladium Photocatalyst for Transfer Hydrogenation with Water as a Proton Source</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalytic transfer hydrogenation is achieved over a multivalence&#8208;state palladium photocatalyst, in which protons generated from photocatalytic water splitting are added to unsaturated double bonds. The operando light&#8208;induced Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy confirms the synergistic action between Pd single atoms and nanoparticles, in which the H&#8208; produced by palladium nanoparticles migrate to single atoms where the substrate is located, resulting in hydrogenation reaction.









Abstract
Hydrogenation reactions are fundamental in the fine chemical, pharmaceutical, and petrochemical industries, however heavily relying on H2 gas at high temperatures and pressures, incurring large energy and carbon costs. Photocatalytic transfer hydrogenation, using water as a proton source, offers a greener alternative, but&#160;existing photocatalysts often suffer from&#160;modest yields, limited selectivity, and narrow substrate scope. Additionally, they often require co&#8208;activation, such as Mg&#8208;activated water or non&#8208;sustainable hydrogen feeds. Here, a photocatalyst is introduced that offers high yields and selectivities across a broad spectrum of organic compounds. The developed photocatalyst is a multivalence palladium superstructure with&#160;ultrasmall Pd0 nanoparticles enveloped by isolated Pd2+/Pd4+ atoms within a carbon&#8208;nitride matrix. Mechanistic studies reveal that the redox&#8208;flexible Pd single atoms, with triethylamine as an electronic modulator, attract photogenerated holes for water oxidation, while Pd0 nanoparticles facilitate hydrogen transfer to the unsaturated bonds of the organic molecules. The cooperative and dynamic behavior of Pd centers during catalysis, involving transitions among Pd+2, Pd+3, and Pd+4 states, is validated using operando electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. This multivalent palladium catalyst represents a conceptual advance in photocatalytic transfer hydrogenation with water as a hydrogen source, holding promise for sustainable hydrogenation processes in the chemical industry.

         <title>Programmable Bacterial Architects Crafting Sonosensitizers for Tumor&#8208;Specific Sonodynamic Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineered bacterium SPEC5, designed via genetic circuit optimization and tumor cell membrane camouflage, functions as a live drug for efficient and precise tumor&#8208;selective sonosensitizer supply. SPEC5 colonizes tumor tissues, ensuring sustained 5&#8208;aminolevulinic acid (5&#8208;ALA) delivery into tumor cells, triggers in situ protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) biosynthesis, and enables effective treatment. This introduces a novel approach for precise SDT using living engineered bacterial therapeutics.








Abstract
Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is a non&#8208;invasive cancer treatment that uses ultrasound to activate sonosensitizers for selective tumor ablation. With its superior tissue penetration compared to photodynamic therapy, SDT demonstrates the potential to stimulate antitumor immune responses by modulating the tumor microenvironment. However, its clinical application remains limited by poor tumor specificity and suboptimal sonosensitizer accumulation, which reduces efficacy and causes off&#8208;target effects. To address these challenges, an Engineered Probiotic&#8208;based Calibrated 5&#8208;ALA Supply system (SPEC5) is developed to confer tumor selectivity for SDT. Engineered non&#8208;pathogenic E. coli with recombinant plasmids enables efficient 5&#8208;ALA biosynthesis through kinetic remodeling. Homologous tumor cell membrane cloaking further enhances tumor targeting and immune evasion. Upon intravenous injection, SPEC5 selectively colonizes in the tumor, supporting the sonosensitizer protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) in situ biosynthesis via 5&#8208;aminolevulinic acid (5&#8208;ALA) continuous supply. A hypoxia&#8208;inducible promoter regulating O&#8208;acetylserine sulfhydrylase ensures the tumor specificity of PpIX production. This system achieves robust sensitizer accumulation in tumors, enhancing SDT efficacy and inducing potent antitumor immune activation with minimal systemic toxicity. Post&#8208;treatment, the bacteria are rapidly cleared to ensure safety. This study presents a novel strategy for tumor&#8208;specific sonosensitizer supply, revolutionizing 5&#8208;ALA&#8208;based SDT and paving the way for advanced tumor&#8208;targeted therapies with enhanced immunotherapeutic outcomes.

         <title>Robust Self&#8208;Healing Polyurethane&#8208;Based Solid&#8208;State Ion&#8208;Conductive Elastomers with Exceptional Strength and Ionic Conductivity for Multifunctional Strain Sensors and Triboelectric Nanogenerators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;healing, recyclable polyurethane&#8208;based conductor (DACPU/100Li) is engineered via supramolecular and dynamic covalent networks, exhibiting ionic conductivity (1.23 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1), tensile strength (7.62&#160;MPa), 1200% stretchability, and tear resistance (45.6&#160;kJ m&#8722;2). Its sensor enables machine&#8208;learning&#8208;assisted gesture recognition (sensitivity 5.89, strain 0.1&#8211;1000%), while its triboelectric nanogenerator harvests energy (3.87&#160;W m&#8722;2) and supports machine&#8208;learning&#8208;assisted object recognition.








Abstract
Flexible ionic conductors hold potential for wearable sensors and energy harvesting. However, most gel&#8208;based conductors suffer from solvent evaporation and liquid leakage, limiting practical applications. Although solid&#8208;state ionic conductors mitigate these issues, achieving strong mechanics, high conductivity, self&#8208;healing, and stability remains challenging. Here, by integrating supramolecular engineering and dynamic covalent adaptive networks, a self&#8208;healing polyurethane&#8208;based solid&#8208;state ion&#8208;conductive elastomer (DACPU/100Li) with outstanding overall properties is successfully synthesized. DACPU/100Li exhibits ultrahigh ionic conductivity (1.23 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1) and high tensile strength (7.62&#160;MPa), along with an elongation at break of 1200%. Additionally, it exhibits excellent tear resistance and a fracture energy of 45.6&#160;kJ m&#8722;2, along with 96% self&#8208;healing efficiency (after self&#8208;healing at 120&#160;&#176;C for 24&#160;h), good recyclability, and stability under extreme conditions. The DACPU/100Li&#8208;based sensor has high sensitivity (5.89) and a wide strain range (0.1&#8211;1000%). Integrated with machine learning, it enables precise gesture recognition and human&#8211;machine interaction. Furthermore, the triboelectric nanogenerator based on DACPU/100Li achieves a high power density of 3.87&#160;W m&#8722;2. It harvests energy from body motion to power small devices and aids object recognition via machine learning. It is believed that these solid&#8208;state ion&#8208;conductive elastomers provide new opportunities for wearable electronics, energy harvesting, and ionotronics.

         <title>Natural van der Waals Canalization Lens for Non&#8208;Destructive Nanoelectronic Circuit Imaging and Inspection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Canalization&#8208;based super&#8208;resolution imaging has been achieved based on ultralow&#8208;loss and extremely anisotropic phonon polaritons in a natural van der Waals material &#945;&#8208;MoO3. This canalization lens exhibits the superior capability to resolve deeply subwavelength feature sizes down to 15&#160;nm, which represents a promising solution for non&#8208;destructive nanoelectronic circuit imaging and inspection.









Abstract
Optical inspection has long served as a cornerstone non&#8208;destructive method in semiconductor wafer manufacturing, particularly for surface and defect analysis. However, conventional techniques such as dark&#8208;field scattering optics or atomic force microscopy (AFM) face significant limitations, including insufficient resolution or the inability to resolve subsurface features. Here, an approach is proposed that integrates the strengths of dark&#8208;field scattering optics and AFM by leveraging a van der Waals (vdW) canalization lens based on natural biaxial &#945;&#8208;MoO3 crystals. This method enables ultrahigh&#8208;resolution subwavelength imaging with the ability to visualize both surface and buried structures, achieving a spatial resolution of 15&#160;nm and grating pitch detection down to 100&#160;nm. The underlying mechanism relies on the unique anisotropic properties of &#945;&#8208;MoO3, where its atomic&#8208;scale unit cells and biaxial symmetry facilitate the diffraction&#8208;free propagation of both evanescent and propagating waves via a flat&#8208;band canalization regime. Unlike metamaterial&#8208;based superlenses and hyperlenses, which suffer from high plasmonic losses, fabrication imperfections, and uniaxial constraints, &#945;&#8208;MoO3 provides robust and super&#8208;resolution imaging in multiple directions. The approach is successfully applied to achieve high&#8208;resolution inspection of buried nanoscale electronic circuits, offering unprecedented capabilities essential for next&#8208;generation semiconductor manufacturing.

         <title>Sonicated Carbon Nanotube Catalysts for Efficient Point&#8208;of&#8208;use Water Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The growing demand for freshwater and rising contamination of water sources require innovative treatment technologies. Sonicated carbon nanotubes can activate persulfate for selective contaminant degradation via nonradical pathways. This scalable approach enables rapid pollutant removal, offering a sustainable solution for decentralized freshwater production in real&#8208;world applications.








Abstract
The rising demand for freshwater and increasing contamination of distributed water sources, such as stormwater and surface water, necessitate innovative point&#8208;of&#8208;use treatment technologies. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) using solid oxidants offer a promising approach for decentralized freshwater production but are often limited by nonselective radical reactions that degrade both pollutants and background water constituents. Here, sonicated carbon nanotubes (CNTs) that efficiently activate peroxymonosulfate are demonstrated, enabling selective contaminant degradation via dual nonradical pathways&#8212;singlet oxygen oxidation and direct electron transfer. Optimized sonication introduces catalytically active carbonyl (C&#9552;O) groups on CNT surfaces while preserving their graphitic structure, ensuring rapid electron transfer. This approach achieves 2,4&#8208;dichlorophenol removal, a common industrial and municipal pollutant, within 5&#160;min at a record removal rate of 4.80&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1. Furthermore, scalable CNT catalyst synthesis and integration into flat membrane and hollow fiber filtration devices, ensuring long&#8208;term stability and efficient pollutant removal in natural river water, are demonstrated. By advancing selective CNT catalysts for AOPs, this work offers a scalable, sustainable solution for point&#8208;of&#8208;use freshwater production in real&#8208;world applications.

         <title>Stretchable, Ultralong Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Poly(urethane&#8208;urea) Elastomer Resistant to Humidity and Heat</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent polyurethane with a microphase separation structure exhibits excellent stretchability properties and ultralong phosphorescence. Different afterglow color effects are achieved by modifying the structure of the phosphor. The polyurethane demonstrates remarkable resistance to humidity and heat. The potential applications of polymers in flexible light&#8208;emitting devices, information encryption systems, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting technologies are explored.








Abstract
Polymeric room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials exhibiting facile processability, high thermal stability, and environmental compatibility have garnered considerable attention. However, achieving excellent stretchability in simultaneity with ultralong RTP remains challenging because most RTP polymers rely on rigid structures with inherently poor tensile properties. Herein, a stretchable, ultralong RTP polyurethane is prepared through copolymerizing a novel phosphor dihydroxy&#8208;functionalized indolocarbazole, 4,4&#8242;&#8208;methylenedicyclohexyl diisocyanate (HMDI), poly(tetrahydrofuran) (PTMEG 2000), and adipic dihydrazide (AD). The phosphor is covalently bonded to the polyurethane backbone, which facilitates the stabilization of triplet excitons and achieves ultralong RTP. The obtained copolymers exhibit a maximum strain of 1400% and the longest phosphorescence lifetime of 1888 ms. Additionally, the polyurethanes exhibiting different afterglow colors are prepared by varying the molecular structure of the phosphor. Notably, the RTP polyurethane materials also display resistance to humidity and heat. This work may provide a new option for the development of stretchable, ultralong RTP materials.

         <title>Micromotion&#8208;Driven &#8220;Mechanical&#8208;Electrical&#8208;Pharmaceutical Coupling&#8221; Bone&#8208;Guiding Membrane Modulates Stress&#8208;Concentrating Inflammation Under Diabetic Fractures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Micromotion activates a &#8220;mechano&#8208;electro&#8208;pharmaceutical&#8221; system, converting mechanical energy to electrical cues that trigger Met release. These cues suppress inflammation via M1&#8208;M2 macrophage polarization and osteogenesis enhancement, while Met blocks NF&#8208;&#954;B (reducing cytokines) and activates AMPK (promoting bone/vessel growth). In diabetic fractures, Met&#8208;PF@PPy cut inflammation, boosted vasculature, and elevated bone metrics.









Abstract
The use of piezoelectric materials to convert micromechanical energy at the fracture site into electrical signals, thereby modulating stress&#8208;concentrated inflammation, has emerged as a promising treatment strategy for diabetic fractures. However, traditional bone&#8208;guiding membranes often face challenges in diabetic fracture repair due to their passive and imprecise drug release profiles. Herein, a piezoelectric polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) fibrous membrane is fabricated through electrospinning and oxidative polymerization to load metformin (Met) into a polypyrrole (PPy) coating (Met&#8208;PF@PPy), creating a &#8220;mechanical&#8208;electrical&#8208;pharmaceutical coupling&#8221; system. In a micromotion mechanical environment, Met&#8208;PF@PPy converts mechanical energy into electrical signals, activating the electrochemical reduction of PPy and triggering stress&#8208;responsive Met release. The generated electrical signals suppress inflammation through M1&#8208;to&#8208;M2 macrophage polarization and simultaneously enhance osteogenesis. Simultaneously, Met inhibits the NF&#8208;&#954;B pathway to reduce pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines while activating the AMPK pathway to promote osteogenesis and angiogenesis. In a diabetic mouse femoral fracture model, Met&#8208;PF@PPy significantly reduces inflammatory markers, enhances vascularization, and increases bone mineral density and bone volume fraction by over 30%. This &#8220;force&#8208;electric&#8208;drug coupling&#8221; strategy provides an innovative approach for active regulation in diabetic fracture repair and offers a versatile platform for advancing piezoelectric materials in regenerative medicine.

         <title>Oxygen Vacancy&#8208;Li2ZrO3: A New Choice for Boosting Homogenous Distribution and Transport of Lithium Ion in Composite Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen&#8208;vacancy lithium zirconate (O&#8208;LZO) reduces the bonding between lithium ion (Li+) and anions in lithium salts, promoting dissociation and increasing the concentration of free Li+. Kinetic simulations confirm the excellent intrinsic Li+ diffusion capability of O&#8208;LZO. As an active filler, O&#8208;LZO broadens Li+ transport pathways and enhances the dissociation and distribution of lithium salts, improving overall electrolyte performance.








Abstract
The low concentration and inhomogenous distribution of free lithium ion (Li+) in composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs) greatly restrict the Li+ transport, cycle stability and rate performance of all solid&#8208;state batteries. In this work, lithium zirconate with superficial oxygen (O)&#8208;vacancies (O&#8208;LZO) is reported as a new Li+ conductors for polyethylene oxide (PEO)&#8208;based CPEs (PEO@O&#8208;LZO). The O&#8208;LZO demonstrates exceptional Li+ transport capability, and its superficial O&#8208;vacancies efficiently adsorb anions to facilitate the dissociation of lithium salts, leading a high concentration of free Li+ in CPEs. Furthermore, the electropositive equilibrium charge layer of O&#8208;vacancies avoids the aggregation of Li+ near the filler and achieves a stable interface to promote the efficient and continuous Li+ transport. These effects contribute to a high Li+ conductivity of 1.63 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 and a Li+ migration number of 0.35 for PEO@O&#8208;LZO at 40&#160;&#176;C. The assembled battery (LiFePO4/PEO@O&#8208;LZO/Li) exhibits a capacity of 120 mAh g&#8722;1 at 3 C and stable cycling performance with an 80.5% capacity retention after 800 cycles at 1 C and 40&#160;&#176;C, maintaining excellent coulombic efficiency. This work provides a design principle of fillers to regulate Li+ concentration and distribution in CPEs for efficient solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Highly Tunable Relaxors Developed from Antiferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Relaxor materials developed from the archetypal antiferroelectric PbZrO3 show a more complex phase transition and unconventional multi&#8208;phase competition compared with traditional relaxors developed from typical ferroelectrics, achieving ultrahigh dielectric response and tunability that can be sustained in the radio&#8208;frequency range, underscoring a promising approach to develop relaxors with enhanced functional capabilities and new possibilities.








Abstract
Highly responsive, voltage&#8208;tunable dielectrics are essential for microwave&#8208;telecommunication electronics. Ferroelectric/relaxor materials have been leading candidates for such functionality and have exhibited agile dielectric responses. Here, it is demonstrated that relaxor materials developed from antiferroelectrics can achieve both ultrahigh dielectric response and tunability. The system, based on alloying the archetypal antiferroelectric PbZrO3 with the dielectric BaZrO3, exhibits a more complex phase evolution than that in traditional relaxors and is characterized by an unconventional multi&#8208;phase competition between antiferroelectric, ferroelectric, and paraelectric order. This interplay of phases can greatly enhance the local heterogeneities and results in relaxor characteristics while preserving considerable polarizability. Upon studying Pb1&#8208;xBaxZrO3 for x = 0&#8208;0.45, Pb0.65Ba0.35ZrO3 is found to provide for exceptional dielectric tunability under low bias fields (&#8776;81% at 200&#160;kV cm&#8722;1 and &#8776;91% at 500&#160;kV cm&#8722;1) at 10&#160;kHz, outcompeting most traditional relaxor ferroelectric films. This high tunability is sustained in the radio&#8208;frequency range, resulting in a high commutation quality factor (&gt;2000 at 1&#160;GHz). This work highlights the phase evolution from antiferroelectrics (with lower, &#8220;positive&#8221; dielectric tunability) to relaxors (with higher, &#8220;negative&#8221; tunability), underscoring a promising approach to develop relaxors with enhanced functional capabilities and new possibilities.

&lt;/i&gt;ZrO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; for &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; = 0-0.45, Pb&lt;sub&gt;0.65&lt;/sub&gt;Ba&lt;sub&gt;0.35&lt;/sub&gt;ZrO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is found to provide for exceptional dielectric tunability under low bias fields (&#8776;81% at 200&#160;kV cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and &#8776;91% at 500&#160;kV cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) at 10&#160;kHz, outcompeting most traditional relaxor ferroelectric films. This high tunability is sustained in the radio-frequency range, resulting in a high commutation quality factor (&amp;gt;2000 at 1&#160;GHz). This work highlights the phase evolution from antiferroelectrics (with lower, &#8220;positive&#8221; dielectric tunability) to relaxors (with higher, &#8220;negative&#8221; tunability), underscoring a promising approach to develop relaxors with enhanced functional capabilities and new possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Semipermeable Membrane&#8208;Mediated Hydrogen Bonding Interface for Fabricating High&#8208;Performance Pure PEDOT:PSS Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly conductive flexible pure PEDOT:PSS hydrogel is developed inspired by the control of hierarchical phase separation, which is driven by the formation of dialysis&#8208;mediated hydrogen bonding interaction interface. The obtained hydrogel enables multi&#8208;scenario bioelectronic applications, including neural signals monitoring/stimulation within epileptic rats, human&#8208;machine interactions, and multimodal signal decoupling.








Abstract
Conductive poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) hydrogels are potential bioelectronic interface materials because of their favorable mechanical properties and tunable electrochemical performances. Owing to intrinsic core&#8208;shell colloidal microstructure composed of insulative phase and conductive phase, inducing phase separation via diverse methods are proposed to improve their performances. However, fabrication of high&#8208;performance pure PEDOT:PSS hydrogels via a simple, mild strategy remains challenges. Here, we report a straightforward strategy to yield high&#8208;performance pure PEDOT:PSS hydrogels via the formation of semipermeable membrane&#8208;mediated hydrogen bonding interface. In this method, ethanol&#8208;attracted PSS is free to accumulate at the man&#8208;made interface provided by the semipermeable membrane, to realize controllable hierarchical PEDOT and PSS two&#8208;phase distribution. The separated PEDOT aggregates via &#960;&#8211;&#960; conjugation, followed by the removal of rearranged insulative PSS phase easily, to form PEDOT:PSS hydrogels with satisfactory mechanical and electrochemical performances. This work presents a universal, effective, and controlled strategy to design conductive hydrogels for bioelectronic applications.

         <title>Interface Field&#8208;Effect Passivation Enabled by Selectively Extruded Cations for Printable Mesoscopic Perovskite Solar Cells with Improved Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Field&#8208;effect passivation is achieved by selectively extruded tetraphenylphosphonium cations for suppressing the interfacial non&#8208;radiative recombination, yielding an improved power conversion efficiency of 21.0% for hole transport layer&#8208;free carbon&#8208;based printable mesoscopic perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Mesoporous electron transport layer (ETL) in printable mesoscopic perovskite solar cells (p&#8208;MPSCs) enables rapid and selective extraction of photogenerated electrons and facilitates device fabrication without a hole transport layer (HTL). However, the inherent mesoporous architecture introduces abundant interfacial defects that promote undesired non&#8208;radiative recombination, limiting the power conversion efficiency (PCE). To address this challenge, an interface field&#8208;effect passivation strategy is implemented, leveraging spatially selective cation extrusion. By incorporating tetraphenylphosphonium cations, sterically bulky organic ions that migrate to the perovskite/ETL interface during crystallization, a robust interfacial electrostatic field is introduced. This field simultaneously suppresses the non&#8208;radiative recombination by inducing field&#8208;effect passivation and enhances the charge extraction through optimizing energy alignment. The synergistic effects yield a PCE enhancement from 19.4% to 21.0%. This work underscores the potential of cation&#8208;engineered interfacial fields to improve the performance of HTL&#8208;free carbon&#8208;electrode perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>Eco&#8208;Friendly Multifunctional Hydrogel Sensors Enabled Sustainable and Accurate Human&#8208;Machine Interaction System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the resurrection plants, this paper introduces the reversible intermolecular forces and physical crosslinking method into the hydrogel system to obtain a fully recyclable multifunctional smart hydrogel sensor (RMSHS), which can be completely recycled in a simple step. Moreover, intelligent medical rehabilitation and smart HMI systems are developed for medical diagnostics and real&#8208;time remote controlling.








Abstract
Wearable epidermic electronics assembled by conductive hydrogels exhibit great application potential for their seamless integration with the human body for human&#8208;machine interactions (HMI). However, most multifunctional hydrogel sensors are prone to water loss and become useless e&#8208;waste, resulting in a growing threat to the global environment and human health. Inspired by the resurrection plants, this paper introduces the reversible intermolecular forces and physical crosslinking method into the hydrogel system to obtain a fully recyclable multifunctional smart hydrogel sensor (RMSHS), which can be completely recycled in a simple step. Meanwhile, RMSHS possesses admirable biocompatibility, excellent antibacterial ability (S. aureus and E. coli bacterial inhibition rate of 99.8%), rapid self&#8208;healing ability, and outstanding sensing performances such as low detection limit, fast response/recovery time (160/200&#160;ms). Intelligent medical rehabilitation and smart HMI systems are developed for medical diagnostics and real&#8208;time remote controlling. Moreover, the recyclable triboelectric nanogenerator (R&#8208;TENG) intelligent array, designed based on RMSHS, replaces the electrode consumables in traditional TENGs, realizing the generation of green energy and 100% recyclability of electrode materials. RMSHS can be generalized and applied to other remote&#8208;controlling platforms, paving the way for large&#8208;scale, multi&#8208;scenario applications.

         <title>Membrane&#8208;Ion Interactions Creating Dual&#8208;Nanoconfined Channels for Superior Mixed Ion Separations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic framework membranes featuring abundant acidic groups and matching channel size are constructed. The strong membrane&#8208;ion interactions between the acidic sites and multivalent cations create a dual&#8208;nanoconfinement effect within rigid channels. This mechanism accelerates monovalent ions transport while hindering multivalent ions, enabling superior mixed ion separations.








Abstract
Ion transport in environments with mixed ions is crucial for numerous real&#8208;world applications. However, most membranes suffer from reduced selectivity in the mixed ion environment. Herein, the concept of dual&#8208;nanoconfined channels in covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is demonstrated for superior mixed mono&#8208;/multivalent ion separation. By incorporating acidic functionalities into the pore wall and coupling with a suitable pore size in the COF membranes, multivalent ions interact strongly with the acidic groups. This shields the interactions of the wall with monovalent ions, leaves sufficient space for fast monovalent ion passage, and in the meantime blocks multivalent ions, creating well&#8208;defined dual&#8208;nanoconfinement for mixed ion separation. Consequently, mixed Li+/Mg2+ ion selectivity exceeding 1,300 and mono&#8208;/trivalent ion selectivity over 9,000 is achieved. Molecular dynamics simulation and experiment with multiple ion pairs further confirm the mechanisms. The study sheds light on a fundamentally new design principle for mixed ion separation, offering the potential to reach remarkable selectivity in practical applications.

         <title>Large Spin&#8208;Orbit Torque with Multi&#8208;Directional Spin Components in Ni4W</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni4W is theoretically proposed and experimentally verified as a promising unconventional spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT) material for generating multi&#8208;directional spins. Epitaxial Ni4W thin films with outstanding crystallinity are grown by magnetron sputtering.

Abstract
Spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT) offers an efficient mechanism for manipulating the magnetization of ferromagnetic materials in spintronics&#8208;based memory and logic devices. However, conventional SOT materials, such as heavy metals and topological insulators, are limited by high crystal symmetry to generating and injecting only in&#8208;plane spins into the ferromagnet. Low&#8208;symmetry materials and symmetry&#8208;breaking strategies have been employed to generate unconventional spin currents with out&#8208;of&#8208;plane spin polarization, enabling field&#8208;free deterministic switching of perpendicular magnetization. Despite this progress, the SOT efficiency of these materials has typically remained low. Here, a large SOT efficiency of 0.3 in the bulk Ni4W at room temperature is reported, as evaluated by second harmonic Hall measurements. In addition, due to the low crystal symmetry of Ni4W, unconventional SOT from the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane and Dresselhaus&#8208;like spin components are observed. Notably, a large SOT efficiency of 0.73 is observed in W/Ni4W (5&#160;nm), potentially resulting from additional interfacial contributions or extrinsic effects. Furthermore, field&#8208;free switching of perpendicular magnetization has been achieved using the multi&#8208;directional SOT of Ni4W, highlighting its potential as a low&#8208;symmetry SOT material for energy&#8208;efficient spintronic devices.

         <title>A Bionic Textile Sensory System for Humanoid Robots Capable of Intelligent Texture Recognition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bionic pressure/tactile (PT) sensor is designed and fabricated by mimicking slow adaptive (SA) and fast adaptive (FA) cutaneous mechanoreceptors. The PT sensor realizes the function of both SA and FA receptors based on a piezoresistive principle in a single sensor, and an artificial sensory system is constructed for real&#8208;time high&#8208;accuracy surface texture recognition.








Abstract
Artificial tactile perception systems that emulate the functions of slow adaptive (SA) and fast adaptive (FA) cutaneous mechanoreceptors are essential for developing advanced prosthetics and humanoid robots. However, constructing a high&#8208;performance sensory system within a single device capable of simultaneously perceiving both static and dynamic forces for surface&#8208;texture recognition remains a critical challenge; this contrasts with common strategies integrating individual SA&#8208; and FA&#8208;mimicking sensors in multi&#8208;layered, multi&#8208;circuit configurations. Herein, a textile pressure/tactile (PT) sensor is reported based solely on piezoresistive principle alongside high sensitivity and rapid response to both high&#8208;frequency vibrations and static forces. These characteristics are attributed to the sensor's 3D multiscale architecture and the corresponding hierarchical structural deformation of its honeycomb&#8208;like sensing fabric. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application relevant to humanoid robotics and prosthetics, an automated surface&#8208;texture&#8208;recognition system is constructed by integrating the PT sensor with machine&#8208;learning algorithms, a prosthetic device, an industrial robot arm, and a graphical user interface. This artificial sensory system demonstrates the ability to learn distinct object features, differentiate fine surface textures, and subsequently classify unknown textiles with high recognition accuracy (&gt;98.9%) across a wide range of scanning speeds (50&#8211;300&#160;mm s&#8722;1). These results show promise for the future development of interactive artificial intelligence.

         <title>Minimizing Inter&#8208;Lattice Strain to Stabilize Li&#8208;Rich Cathode by Order&#8211;Disorder Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An order&#8211;disorder coherent design in Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based layered cathode enables homogeneous structural evolution during charge&#8211;discharge, minimizing lattice strain and suppressing structural degradation, leading to enhanced cycling stability with negligible voltage decay.








Abstract
Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based layered (LMR) cathodes with anionic redox chemistry show great potential for next&#8208;generation sustainable Li&#8208;ion battery (LIB) applications due to the low cost and high energy density. However, the asynchronous structural evolutions with cycling in the heterogeneous composite structure of LMR lead to serious lattice strain and thus fast electrochemical decay, which hinders the commercialization of LMR cathodes. Here, an order&#8211;disorder coherent LMR cathode is demonstrated that exhibits a higher average voltage (by 0.25&#160;V), negligible voltage decay (97.6% voltage retention after 100 cycles at 100&#160;mA g&#8722;1), and enhanced cycling stability (98% capacity retention after 200 cycles at 100&#160;mA g&#8722;1) compared to its layered oxide counterparts. It is proposed that this order&#8211;disorder coherent structure design can promote a more synchronous and homogeneous structure evolution during charge and discharge, thus minimizing lattice strain, which significantly prevents layer collapse and collective degradation at high voltage, improving the electrochemical stability. The study displays the feasibility of optimizing the performance of Li&#8208;rich cathode materials through a dedicated order&#8211;disorder structure control for sustainable energy storage.

         <title>Hour&#8208;Level and Air&#8208;Stable Organic Long&#8208;Persistent Luminescence from Organic&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic&#8211;inorganic material with air&#8208;stable organic long&#8208;persistent luminescence (OLPL) lasting over 20 h is obtained by immobilizing organic guests within inorganic B2O3&#8208;containing traps through hydrogen bonding. The charge carriers trapped/released by traps play an important role in the OLPL.









Abstract
Organic long&#8208;persistent luminescence (OLPL) materials show important application prospects in bioimaging due to their low biotoxicity and the ability to eliminate the interference of background fluorescence. However, OLPL materials suffer from poor environmental stability and short afterglow times. Herein, by introducing the phosphorescent guest 2, 3&#8208;naphthalimide (NAI) into the B2O3 (BO) matrix using a solvent&#8208;free method in an air atmosphere, an organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid material NAI/BO is obtained, exhibiting OLPL lasting for more than 20&#160;h, visible to the naked eye for up to 180&#160;min. Photoluminescence and thermoluminescence spectra reveal that the OLPL originates from pure phosphorescence of NAI, and is induced by inorganic defects generated by oxygen vacancies in BO. The NAI electrons in the excited state can be captured by the defect, then detrapped through the thermal activation process, and eventually returned to the triplet state of NAI, thereby achieving OLPL emission. NAI/BO is successfully applied in vivo imaging stimulated in vitro. In addition, the universality of this strategy is verified by changing the phosphorescent guest molecules, enabling the regulation of OLPL from green to orange&#8211;red light. These results provide an important foundation for the design and development of stable OLPL materials and the practical applications in biological imaging.

         <title>Edge States in 2D A2PbBr4 Hybrid Perovskites Enabled by Local Structural Reorganization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;energy edge states in two&#8208;dimensional hybrid lead halide perovskites are driven by Rashba/Dresselhaus spin splitting, resulting from local structural distortions at the crystal edges. Strained PbBr6 octahedra cause out&#8208;of&#8208;plane distortions, breaking inversion symmetry and enabling spin splitting. These edge states with enhanced charge dynamics facilitate efficient light emission and could improve device performance in spintronic and optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
The edge states (ES) in two&#8208;dimensional (2D) hybrid lead halide perovskites (LHPs) exhibit distinct electronic characteristics, including lower energy and longer lifetimes compared to the interior states (IS). Though the ES of these 2D LHPs show prospect of facilitating photovoltaic and optoelectronic effects, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here, the occurrence of ES in a family of 2D A2PbBr4 (A = organic amine cation) LHPs is attributed to the Rashba/Dresselhaus (RD) spin splitting induced&#160;by local structural reorganization on the crystal edge. The experimental and theoretical characterizations reveal that the local structure on the crystal edge is significantly strained, which leads to considerable out&#8208;of&#8208;plane distortion of adjacent PbBr6 octahedra, local loss of inversion symmetry and therefore spin&#8208;splitting energy required for the formation of ES. This findings contribute fresh perspectives to the fundamental comprehension of the RD effect, extending the boundaries of spintronics and opening promising pathways for the conceptualization and refinement of devices centered on ES.

&lt;p&gt;Low-energy edge states in two-dimensional hybrid lead halide perovskites are driven by Rashba/Dresselhaus spin splitting, resulting from local structural distortions at the crystal edges. Strained PbBr&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; octahedra cause out-of-plane distortions, breaking inversion symmetry and enabling spin splitting. These edge states with enhanced charge dynamics facilitate efficient light emission and could improve device performance in spintronic and optoelectronic applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The edge states (ES) in two-dimensional (2D) hybrid lead halide perovskites (LHPs) exhibit distinct electronic characteristics, including lower energy and longer lifetimes compared to the interior states (IS). Though the ES of these 2D LHPs show prospect of facilitating photovoltaic and optoelectronic effects, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here, the occurrence of ES in a family of 2D A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PbBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (A = organic amine cation) LHPs is attributed to the Rashba/Dresselhaus (RD) spin splitting induced&#160;by local structural reorganization on the crystal edge. The experimental and theoretical characterizations reveal that the local structure on the crystal edge is significantly strained, which leads to considerable out-of-plane distortion of adjacent PbBr&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; octahedra, local loss of inversion symmetry and therefore spin-splitting energy required for the formation of ES. This findings contribute fresh perspectives to the fundamental comprehension of the RD effect, extending the boundaries of spintronics and opening promising pathways for the conceptualization and refinement of devices centered on ES.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In Situ Magnetoelectric Generation of miRNA Sponges and Wireless Electric Stimulus by Conductive Granular Scaffolds for Nerve Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conductive granular scaffold (cGRAS) is developed to enable wireless electrical stimulation and targeted miRNA modulation for traumatic brain injury (TBI) repair. Acting as both an antenna and a gene delivery platform, cGRAS facilitates miRNA sponge formation and neuronal regeneration via AMF&#8208;triggered electroporation and mechanotransduction, leading to reduced inflammation, enhanced angiogenesis, and improved functional recovery.








Abstract
Electronic signaling and microRNA (miRNA) regulation play pivotal roles in determining neuronal cell fate and promoting brain recovery. Despite this, clinical advancements are hindered by the limited availability of tools for spatiotemporal electrical signaling and non&#8208;viral gene modulation in neurons in vivo. In this study, a conductive granular scaffold (cGRAS) that doubles as an antenna and neuronal gene delivery agent for targeted miRNA regulation of nerve repair in traumatic brain injury (TBI) is developed. The inherent features of granular scaffolds reduce the inflammation and glial scarring in TBI by mitigating activated microglia and stellate cells. Upon irradiation with an external alternating magnetic field (AMF), the &#8220;electromagnetic messenger&#8221; induces electrical stimulation to restore brain function and promotes temporal electroporation. This process, together with mechanotransduction capability of cGRAS, enhances the delivery and formation of miRNA sponges both in vitro and in vivo, thereby reducing the overexpression of miR6263, which is significantly upregulated upon neuronal injury. In the whole brain imaging analysis, suppression of inflammation, angiogenesis around the TBI cavity, and infiltration of newborn neurons in the injured area are observed after in situ magnetoelectric formation of miRNA sponges and wireless electric stimulus, leading to improved brain function and behavioral recovery. Overall, this cGRAS represents a potentially innovative and versatile tool for clinical neuronal regeneration engineering.

         <title>Discovering Stable Amorphous Ceramics: From Computational Prediction to Thin&#8208;Film Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a computationally guided approach to discovering stable amorphous ceramics, using yttrium tungsten nitride (Y&#8208;W&#8208;N) as a prototype. By combining first&#8208;principles random structure sampling with thin&#8208;film synthesis, the authors identify and experimentally realize previously unreported amorphous nitrides, demonstrating their exceptional thermal stability, tunable properties, and superior diffusion barrier performance.








Abstract
Amorphous materials offer unique functional characteristics, which are not observed in their crystalline counterparts making them invaluable for many applications in science and technology, such as electronic and optical devices, solid&#8208;state batteries, and protective coatings. However, finding compositions that are stable against crystallization and/or phase separation, and at the same time offer the needed functionality in the amorphous phase is still largely done by serendipity or trial&#8208;and&#8208;error. In this work, using yttrium tungsten nitride as a prototype, it is shown how computational random structure sampling provides a robust method to identify compositions that exhibit a highly corrugated potential energy surface with many narrow local minima, which are consequently hard to crystallize and remain stable in the amorphous phase. Synthesis experiments prove that the predicted nitride is readily synthesized in an amorphous phase with no detectable precipitates. High&#8208;throughput and conventional characterization of structural, physical, and functional properties of the discovered amorphous nitride compound reveal its attractive properties and possible application potential. The proposed workflow combining theory and experiment is broadly applicable to the discovery of a wide range of amorphous ceramic materials, paving the way for advanced amorphous materials for diverse emerging technologies.

         <title>Polyanhydride&#8208;Based Microparticles for Programmable Pulsatile Release of Diphtheria Toxoid (DT) for Single&#8208;Injection Self&#8208;Boosting Vaccines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a polyanhydride&#8208;based delivery platform for single&#8208;injection, self&#8208;boosting vaccines. The system enables programmable, pulsatile release of diphtheria toxoid with high antigen recovery and is guided by machine learning for tunability. In vivo results show immune responses comparable to multi&#8208;dose regimens, highlighting its potential to improve vaccine accessibility and reduce under&#8208;immunization.








Abstract
Vaccination remains a critical tool in preventing infectious diseases, yet its effectiveness is undermined by under&#8208;immunization, particularly for vaccines requiring multiple doses that patients fail to complete. To address this challenge, the development of single&#8208;injection platforms delivering self&#8208;boosting vaccines has gained significant attention. Despite some advances, translating these platforms into clinical applications has been limited. In this study, a novel polyanhydride&#8208;based polymeric delivery platform is introduced, designed for single&#8208;injection self&#8208;boosting vaccines, replacing multiple doses. Over 20 polyanhydride polymers are synthesized and screened, ultimately down selecting to 6 for in vitro studies, and 2 for in vivo studies. Using diphtheria toxoid (DT) as a model antigen, programmed pulsatile release with a narrow window is demonstrated, ideal for self&#8208;boosting immunization. The platform effectively protects the pH&#8208;sensitive antigen before release, achieving recovery rate of 39.7% to 89.7%. The system's tunability is further enhanced by machine learning algorithms, which accurately predict release profiles, confirmed through experimental validation. In vivo studies in a mouse model reveals that the platform induces DT&#8208;specific antibody responses comparable to those generated by traditional multi&#8208;dose regimens. Collectively, these findings highlight the potential of this platform to deliver various vaccines, offering a potentially promising solution to the global challenge of under&#8208;immunization.

         <title>Conductance Reinforced Relaxation Attenuation with Strong Metal&#8208;N Coordination in Multivariate &#960;&#8208;Conjugated MOFs for Integrated Radar&#8208;Infrared Camouflage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work leverages a conductance&#8208;reinforced attenuation mechanism via enhanced Metal&#8208;N coordination to boost electron mobility and optimize electromagnetic response. The &#960;&#8208;conjugated MOFs are 3D&#8208;printed into a stealth drone propeller that achieves both radar and infrared stealth.








Abstract
&#960;&#8208;conjugated metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as promising candidates for electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorption, owning to their high conductivity and versatile structural tunability. Nevertheless, the effective control over their dielectric properties is a challenge. Herein, the charge carrier migration in &#960;&#8208;conjugated MOFs is harnessed to significantly amplify the electromagnetic response, where the strengthened atom coordination can activate a distinctive conductance&#8208;reinforced attenuation mechanism. This results in finely calibrated EMW absorption characteristics, including a wide effective absorption bandwidth of 6.0 GHz at mere 2 mm, a minimum reflection loss of &#8722;46.7 dB at 3.5 mm, and a substantial reduction in radar cross&#8208;section (RCS) up to &#8722;23.3 dBm2. Furthermore, the seamless integration of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated MOF hybrids within ultraviolet (UV)&#8208;curable 3D printing technology has enabled the fabrication of a stealth&#8208;enabled drone propeller prototype, which exhibits a remarkably low infrared emissivity of 0.205. Additionally, when the propeller device is subjected to a 100 &#176;C heating platform for 30 min, its surface temperature remains below 50 &#176;C, demonstrating exceptional thermal management and stability under elevated temperature conditions. This work underscores the immense potential of these cutting&#8208;edge absorbers to shape the future of advanced military stealth technologies.

         <title>Optimizing Printed Quasi&#8208;2D Luminescent Perovskite Films via Delaminated Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ heterogeneous nucleation strategy for quasi&#8208;2D perovskite films via microelectronic printing is demonstrated, employing delaminated Cd&#8208;MOF as modulators. The layered Cd&#8208;MOF framework facilitates controlled nucleation, regulates phase distribution, and promotes stress relaxation, yielding films with an ultrahigh photoluminescence quantum yield and enhanced stability. These advancements underscore the potential of MOF&#8208;assisted synthesis in advancing high&#8208;performance perovskite materials for optoelectronics.








Abstract
Microelectronic printing technology has recently emerged as a key approach in advancing pixel&#8208;array perovskite films, particularly quasi&#8208;2D perovskite films, to meet current scientific and technological demands. However, its further development remains hindered by the uncontrollable crystallization of perovskite during the printing process. Herein, a novel in situ heterogeneous nucleation growth approach for obtaining quasi&#8208;2D perovskite films is demonstrated, utilizing delaminated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (i.e., layered Cd&#8208;MOF) with an ordered structure as modulators. The inosculation of phenylethylammonium (PEA+) with layered Cd&#8208;MOF serves as crystal nuclei, facilitating heterogeneous crystal nucleation and growth while regulating the distribution of the n&#8208;phase. Moreover, the intercalation of the layered Cd&#8208;MOF alleviates rigid stress, thereby eliminating defects in the printed films. The resulting quasi&#8208;2D perovskite films exhibit an impressive photoluminescence quantum yield of 37.40% along with exceptional luminescent stability, making them promising candidates for various optoelectronic applications. Overall, this study highlights the significant potential of MOF&#8208;assisted synthesis in advancing high&#8208;performance perovskite materials through microelectronic printing technology, offering a promising pathway for the development of future optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Mannosylated MOF Encapsulated in Lactobacillus Biofilm for Dual&#8208;Targeting Intervention Against Mammalian Escherichia coli Infections</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops a dual&#8208;targeting nano&#8208;system (Zn&#8208;MOF@Man/LRB) against Escherichia coli infection. Mannosylated Zn&#8208;MOF aggregates bacteria via FimH recognition and disrupts biofilms, while Lactobacillus biofilm encapsulation enables gut&#8208;targeted immunomodulation and sustains nanomaterial release. The system restores microbiota equilibrium and promotes stem cell differentiation and barrier stability. This approach demonstrates cross&#8208;species anti&#8208;diarrheal efficacy, advancing safe and effective treatment that restores intestinal homeostasis for potential applications in both human medicine and animal husbandry.








Abstract
Pathogenic bacterial infections pose a major concern, especially concerning mammalian enteritis and diarrhea. Compared to conventional antibiotic intervention, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) exhibit superior antibacterial properties and lower&#160;cytotoxicity, demonstrating great promise in the treatment of pathogen&#8208;induced diarrhea. However, the achievement of their precise targeted delivery is still a significant challenge. Herein, a novel precision nano&#8208;system with a dual&#8208;targeting approach for treating intestinal infections caused by Escherichia coli (E. coli) is designed. First, Zn&#8208;MOF was synthesized based on ZnO, which possessed enhanced elimination of planktonic bacteria and biofilms. Through mannosylation, Zn&#8208;MOF@Man specifically recognized the FimH pili of E. coli, leading to its aggregation and subsequent eradication. Second, guided by whole genome sequencing, the encapsulation of Lactobacillus biofilm exertd immunomodulatory function, overcomed challenges related to intestinal targeting, and facilitated sustained drug release. Furthermore, Zn&#8208;MOF@Man/LRB maintaind microbiota equilibrium and promoted stem cell differentiation and barrier stability, ensuring consistent anti&#8208;diarrheal and anti&#8208;inflammatory efficacy in mice, piglets, and humans. This approach represents a novel dual&#8208;targeting antimicrobial strategy, combining probiotic biofilms and E. coli&#8208;oriented delivery, advancing safe and effective treatment that restores intestinal homeostasis for potential applications in both human medicine and animal husbandry.

         <title>Efficient Red Perovskite LEDs with Iodine Management via Volatile Additive I2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Elemental iodine (I2) is used to create an iodine&#8208;rich environment for inhibiting the formation of iodine vacancy defects. This strategy also modifies the perovskite's surface energy, regulating its crystallization kinetics and resulting in a more well&#8208;crystallized perovskite with a preferred (001)&#8208;orientation. Consequently, PeLEDs with efficiencies of 32.5% for deep&#8208;red (678 nm) and 29.5% for pure&#8208;red (649 nm) have been achieved.








Abstract
Perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) face a tough challenge that halogen vacancy defects limit device performance, while the introduction of additional agents to passivate defects may potentially compromise the stability of the structure and increase the complexity of the system. Here, elemental iodine (I2) is employed as an additive, utilizing its ability to create an iodine&#8208;rich condition and to transform into I&#8722; ions for passivating iodine vacancy defects, while its volatile nature ensures no residue and avoids the introduction of extraneous elements. This approach also alters the perovskite's surface energy and subsequently regulates its crystallization kinetics, which results in a more well&#8208;crystallized perovskite with vertically&#8208;aligned organic spacer layers, in turn promoting the transport of charge carriers. On the basis of this strategy, PeLEDs with efficiencies of 32.5% and 29.5% for deep&#8208;red (678 nm) and pure&#8208;red (649 nm) have been achieved, respectively.

         <title>Nonlinear Conductive Graphene Composites for Pressure Sensing with a Linear Response and Voltage&#8208;Driven Thermal Correction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nonlinear conductive graphene composite (NcGc) layer, incorporating a conductive laser&#8208;reduced graphene oxide layer, is assembled into flexible pressure sensors without microstructural designs, achieving high sensitivity (742.3 kPa&#8722;1) and a wide linear sensing range (&gt;800&#160;kPa). The nonlinear conductivity of the NcGc layer enables bias&#8208;tunable sensitivity, inherently correcting thermal drifts and thereby preserving the precision of robotic gripper manipulation across varying temperatures.








Abstract
Thermal fluctuations pose a significant challenge to the signal stability of nanomaterial&#8208;based piezoresistive pressure sensors, limiting their effectiveness in applications such as electronic skin and robotics. Conventional temperature compensation strategies often rely on additional thermal sensors or complex calibration algorithms. Here, a flexible pressure sensor is reported featuring a nonlinear conductive graphene composite layer within a bilayer architecture, enabling bias voltage&#8208;controlled sensitivity without structural redesign. The sensor achieves ultra&#8208;high sensitivity (742.3 kPa&#8722;1), a broad linear sensing range of up to 800&#160;kPa (R2 = 0.99913), and excellent long&#8208;term durability over 10&#8201;000 cycles. Crucially, the unique nonlinear characteristics enable the bias voltage to function as an internal remote control for correcting temperature drifts between 25 and 60&#160;&#176;C, as demonstrated by precise manipulation in robotic grippers under varying temperature conditions. This work offers a universal strategy for building environmentally adaptive sensors, advancing the development of robust and high&#8208;precision wearable electronics.

Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have shown remarkable progress in laboratory&#8208;scale devices, but their scalability to large&#8208;area perovskite solar modules (PSMs) remains challenging due to significant performance loss. Here, a multi&#8208;site passivation strategy is reported by employing Bis(2,5&#8208;dioxopyrrolidin&#8208;1&#8208;yl) 2,2&#8242;&#8208;(propane&#8208;2,2&#8208;diylbis(sulfanediyl)) diacetate (TK&#8208;NHS) as an interfacial modifier to address the critical issues of interface recombination and stability in both PSCs and PSMs. TK&#8208;NHS effectively inactivates common defects, by modifying the surface of perovskite films through multi&#8208;site synergistical interactions. Additionally, a stable dipole layer formed at the interface optimizes energy level alignment, facilitating efficient electron extraction and transport. The resulting perovskite film exhibited a smoother and more homogeneous surface, thus improving interface contact and reducing nonradiative recombination. Consequently, TK&#8208;NHS&#8208;treated PSCs achieved a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.16%, with significantly improved open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.188&#160;V and fill factor (FF) of 85.3%. The scalable potential of this multi&#8208;site passivation strategy has been verified by corresponding PSMs, delivering an impressive PCE of 22.25%. Notably, the devices exhibited exceptional operational stability, retaining 91.4% and 90% of their initial PCE after 1000 and 800 h of continuous illumination, respectively. Thereby advancing the progress of the scaled&#8208;up production of PSCs to modules.

         <title>Dynamic Switching Spin State of Fe Single Atoms for Piezoelectric&#8208;Mediated Overall Nitrogen Fixation Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, an alternating piezoelectric field is introduced into Fe SAs anchored defective&#8208;BaTiO3 (OvBTO&#8208;Fe), and dynamic and bidirectional switching of spin&#8208;states can be realized to simultaneously facilitate ammonia and nitrate co&#8208;synthesis for achieving record ONF activity and energy conversion efficiency.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven one&#8208;step disproportionation overall nitrogen fixation (ONF) for synchronously synthesizing ammonia and nitrate presents a promising alternative to conventional Haber&#8208;Bosch and Ostwald processes, but suffers from ultra&#8208;low efficiency. Single atoms (SAs) featured by maximized atomic utilization exhibit superb catalytic activity, while the definite electronic configurations confine SAs to function solely as reduction or oxidation sites, limiting the possibility for both reduction and oxidation reactions. Herein, an efficient approach is presented for ammonia and nitrate co&#8208;synthesis by introducing Fe SAs and alternating piezoelectric field into a defective piezoelectric BaTiO3 (OvBTO&#8208;Fe), enabling the formation spatially&#8208;separated redox regions and dynamic bidirectional switching of Fe spin states. At positive and negative polarization ends, Fe spin state transitions to high and low spin states through d&#8208;electrons relocation, respectively, thermodynamically and kinetically facilitate nitrogen reduction and oxidation reactions. Thus, OvBTO&#8208;Fe exhibits unprecedented piezo&#8208;photocatalytic ONF activity, achieving a record solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency of 0.82% and total energy&#8208;to&#8208;chemical&#160;conversion efficiency of 0.53%. This work proposes a methodology for dynamic multi&#8208;directional manipulation of spin states and overall catalytic synthesis reaction.

         <title>Bionic Triboelectric Nanogenerator Activates the &#8220;mechano&#8208;electro&#8208;biochemical&#8221; Cascade Effect In Situ to Accelerate Critical&#8208;Sized Bone Defect Repair</title>

         <dc:description>
The bionic PPCs&#8208;TENG accelerates CSBD repair through the activation of a &#8220;mechano&#8208;electro&#8208;biochemical&#8221; cascade effect. It generates bio&#8208;ES that dynamically responds to the host's mechanical state, exhibiting a resting membrane potential during static conditions and generating action potentials upon mechanical deformation. This bio&#8208;ES activates both extracellular and intracellular biochemical factors, leading to enhanced osteogenic differentiation and angiogenic processes in CSBDs.








Abstract
The loss of the intrinsic &#8220;mechano&#8208;electro&#8208;biochemical&#8221; cascade effect in critical&#8208;sized bone defects (CSBDs) impedes the bone self&#8208;healing process. Traditional strategies cannot provide bionic electrical output, thereby failing to sufficiently activate the &#8220;mechano&#8208;electro&#8208;biochemical&#8221; cascade effect in situ and limiting the repair efficiency of CSBDs. Here, a bionic, self&#8208;adhesive, and biodegradable triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) called PPCs&#8208;TENG using silk&#8208;fibroin&#8208;derived peptide (Cs)&#8208;grafted polydopamine&#8211;polyacrylamide (PPCs) as the electrode layer is fabricated. It provides bionic electrical stimulation (bio&#8208;ES) in response to the host's motion status. It reestablishes the resting potential during host rest and generates real&#8208;time biofeedback action potential during host movement. Further, it activates the &#8220;mechano&#8208;electro&#8208;biochemical&#8221; cascade effect for accelerating the repair of CSBDs. The bio&#8208;ES generated from PPCs&#8208;TENG enriches extracellular osteogenesis&#8208;related biochemical factors at the CSBD site. It also activates the intracellular mechanosensitive protein Piezo1, thereby promoting calcium signaling and intracellular mechano&#8208;transduction pathways. This activation enhances the proliferation and migration of bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and promotes osteogenic differentiation in BMSCs and angiogenesis in HUVECs. In vivo tests demonstrate that PPCs&#8208;TENG significantly accelerates the repair of CSBDs in situ.

         <title>Building Unit Engineering Toward COF Membranes with Controlled Stacking for H2 Purification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic framework nanosheets are engineered via ternary monomer design to achieve programmable interlayer offsets. Non&#8208;planar alkyl&#8208;functionalized monomers induce interlayer torsion, transitioning AA to AA' and AB stacking for angstrom&#8208;precise pore tuning. The mechanically robust, blade&#8208;cast membranes exhibit exceptional H&#8322;/CO&#8322; selectivity up to 60 in gas mixtures from methanol&#8208;reforming.








Abstract
Hydrogen purification by membrane technology offers a sustainable path to meet the escalating demands of green energy. However, conventional polymeric membranes are constrained by permeability&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off and instability under real&#8208;world operating conditions. While covalent organic framework (COF) membranes hold promise, their overlarge pores and poor film&#8208;processibility are to be imperatively solved. Herein, a ternary building unit system is designed for synthesizing imine&#8208;based COF nanosheets with programmable interlayer offsets. By synergizing a planar aldehyde monomer as the basic structural unit and a none&#8208;planar alkyl&#8208;functionalized aldehyde monomer as the structure regulation unit, we induce layer distortion that disrupts &#960;&#8211;&#960; dominated AA stacking, enabling angstrom&#8208;precise pore tuning (1.4&#8211;0.6&#160;nm) via controlled transitions to AB stacking while retaining crystallinity. The mechanically robust nanosheets are easily assembled into large&#8208;area membranes via a facile blade casting, overcoming the processability bottleneck associated with binary building unit systems. The resulting membranes demonstrate an exceptional H2/CO2 selectivity of 60, surpassing existing benchmarks. When treating gas mixtures from methanol steam reforming, a two&#8208;stage membrane process achieves 99.5% H2 purity and 94.0% recovery. Precise modulation of pore architecture and mechanical flexibility through building units engineered stacking affords a platform for microporous organic membranes.

Four novel small molecule acceptors (SMAs) are synthesized by regulating central&#8208;core cyanobenzene substitution for the first time. The asymmetric substitution increases the power conversion efficiency of organic solar cells to 20.16%. The corresponding device exhibits higher thermal stability and better excitonic behavior, providing important insights for the design of SMAs.








Abstract
Cyanogroup (&#8208;CN) is a strongly electron&#8208;withdrawing and highly polar functional group; therefore, cyanation has been extensively utilized to optimize the terminal groups of high&#8208;performance small&#8208;molecule acceptors (SMAs) in organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, by regulating the cyanobenzene substitution in the central core for the first time, four novel SMAs are synthesized, named phCN&#8208;F, phCN&#8208;Cl, 2phCN&#8208;F, and 2phCN&#8208;Cl. Theoretical and experimental analyses have shown that asymmetric and symmetric cyanobenzene&#8208;substitution of the central core, coupled with selective terminal groups, can significantly affect the intrinsic excitonic properties of the molecule. Blends based on asymmetric cyanobenzene&#8208;substitution molecules possess tighter molecular packing and more suitable phase separation to facilitate exciton dissociation, charge transport, and charge extraction. The optimal device performance of the phCN&#8208;F&#8208;based OSC reaches 20.16%, which is significantly higher than that of symmetrically substituted OSCs. Furthermore, devices prepared based on phCN&#8208;F maintain over 90% of their initial efficiency after being heated at 85&#176;C for 3000 h, demonstrating excellent thermal stability. This study elucidates the potential mechanisms for optimizing device performance through asymmetric cyanobenzene&#8208;substitution of the central core, providing valuable insights for the further design of record&#8208;breaking SMAs.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Photoactive Ferroelectric Semiconductor Incorporating Aromatic Dynamic Spacer Enables Optoelectronic Synaptic Plasticity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#8220;pendulum&#8208;like&#8221; motions of aromatic cations are customized in the 2D constrained environments to construct perovskite photoferroelectrics with unique photo&#8208;ferroelectric coupling effects, which enables the construction of heterojunction phototransistors with superior optoelectronic synaptic plasticity.








Abstract
Photoferroelectrics are capturing the growing interest for their unique light&#8208;polarization coupling and optoelectronic applicability. However, the formidable challenge persists in coupling electric order and strong photoactivity through precise molecular design, hindering their further application in the field of optoelectronic memory. Herein, the molecular dynamics of aromatic cations in the 2D constrained environments are customized to construct perovskite photoferroelectrics, (4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylbenzylammonium)2(ethylammonium)2Pb3I10, showing a narrow bandgap (&#8776;1.96&#160;eV) and strong visible&#8208;photosensitivity. Notably, multi&#8208;level dynamic states of aromatic cations provide the impetus for inducing ferroelectric order and photo&#8208;ferroelectric effects. Such captivating characteristics can achieve light&#8208;induced multiple polarization, dielectric, and conductivity states. Accordingly, photoferroelectrics are integrated into heterojunction phototransistors that display robust electrical and optical modulation, including diversified synaptic plasticity with low optical program power (&#8776;20 pJ) for each training process. As a noteworthy advancement in the photoferroelectric field, this work will enrich the understanding of the structure&#8208;property relationship and shed light on further exploration toward neuromorphic computing.

         <title>Highly Repeatable and Cyclically Stable Mechanoluminescence of the Flexible Composite Elastomer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a solid&#8208;solution strategy to modulate the mechanoluminescence of the composite elastomer with the physical principles proposed. With no need for power supply and circuit design, the developed CaBa4(PO4)3Cl:Eu/PDMS elastomer yields bright and repeatable light for over 20&#160;000 cycles under various rapid and continuous stretching conditions, significantly breaking the performance limitations of the existing materials.








Abstract
Mechanoluminescence (ML) elastomer shows tremendous potential for the next generation of flexible displaying, imaging, and sensing devices. However, inadequate repeatability and cyclic stability are the current bottlenecks. In this work, a solid&#8208;solution strategy is reported to regulate the interfacial interactions of ML elastomer, in which the (Ca,Ba)5(PO4)3Cl:Eu solid solutions and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) are employed, respectively. The results suggest that the solid&#8208;solution strategy can effectively modulate the energy position of the valence band and the charge density distributions of the lowest unoccupied band, as well as the interfacial triboelectrification. Consequently, the ML performance of the composite elastomer in terms of intensity, spectral characteristic, and repeatability has been significantly improved. Particularly, the optimum CaBa4(PO4)3Cl:Eu/PDMS elastomer exhibits stable and repeatable ML for over 20&#160;000 cycles under various rapid and continuous stretching conditions. This work not only provides a highly repeatable and cyclically stable ML elastomer but also clarifies the intrinsic physical principles, showing high guiding significance for future ML design and applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Li&#8208;Rich Layered Cathodes with Negligible Voltage Decay through Migration Retardation Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high entropy design effectively inhibits the structural degradation in Li&#8208;rich cathode materials during cycling, including the oxygen vacancy formation, volume expansion, and Mn coordination environment disordering, thus significantly improving the voltage retention and energy output. This migration retardation effect is attributed to the synergistic enhancement of covalency and ionicity, which makes Mn ion migration thermodynamically infeasible.








Abstract
The development of advanced Li&#8208; and Mn&#8208;rich layered cathodes (LRO) is essential for high&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, LRO exhibits large voltage hysteresis and rapid voltage decay with irreversible TM migration upon prolonged cycling. Given that high&#8208;entropy oxides have expanded the potential for retarding the harmful phase transition and regulating the site energies, therefore a high&#8208;entropy Li1.17Mn0.50Ni0.12Co0.12Mg0.03Cu0.02Ti0.02Nb0.02O2 cathode is synthesized (HELRO) for LIBs in the present study, demonstrated significantly improved voltage retention and energy output. In addition, this work unveils the sluggish degradation of superlattice and local structure in HELRO during long charge&#8211;discharge cycles and explains the &#8220;migration retardation effect.&#8221; The higher configurational entropy contributes to the higher energy barriers for in&#8208;plane, out&#8208;of&#8208;plane, and continuous Mn migrations due to the synergistic ionic&#8211;covalent enhancement of Mn&#9472;O bonds. This work provides new insights for understanding the improvement mechanisms of high entropy cathodes and demonstrates the feasibility of suppressing long&#8208;standing voltage decay by high entropy design combining covalent and ionic elements.

         <title>Antisolvent&#8208;Free Dual&#8208;Anion Regulation for High&#8208;Efficient Sn&#8208;Pb and All&#8208;perovskite Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional dual&#8208;anion synergistic strategy that combines acetate anions (Ac&#8722;) from formamidinium acetate and thiocyanate anions (SCN&#8208;) from guanidinium thiocyanate to produce high&#8208;quality MA&#8208;free Cs0.1FA0.9Pb0.5Sn0.5I3 perovskite films via a simplified antisolvent&#8208;free spin&#8208;coating process. Ac&#8722; anions retard crystallization and mitigate Sn2+ oxidation through the formation of intermediate phases and anion exchange process, while SCN&#8208; anions further promote crystal growth and stabilize Sn2+ via strong coordination interactions, improving energy level alignment and grain boundary management.








Abstract
Mixed tin&#8208;lead (Sn&#8208;Pb) perovskites are integral to all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells (TSCs), offering significant potential to surpass the theoretical efficiency limits of single&#8208;junction solar cells. However, the rapid crystallization of Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite thin films and the propensity of Sn2+ to oxidize into Sn4+ remain critical challenges, hindering device performance and stability. Herein, it is demonstrated that a multifunctional dual&#8208;anion synergistic regulation strategy to fabricate high&#8208;quality MA&#8208;free Cs0.1FA0.9Pb0.5Sn0.5I3 perovskite thin films with superior morphology and crystallinity via a simplified antisolvent&#8208;free spin&#8208;coating process. Acetate anions (Ac&#8722;) derived from formamidinium acetate (FAAc) effectively regulate crystallization kinetics and mitigate Sn2+ oxidation via intermediate phase formation and anion exchange process. Simultaneously, the combination of Ac&#8722; and thiocyanate anions (SCN&#8722;) from guanidinium thiocyanate (GuaSCN) promotes larger crystal grain growth and stabilizes Sn2+ via strong coordination interactions.

&lt;p&gt;A multifunctional dual-anion synergistic strategy that combines acetate anions (Ac&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) from formamidinium acetate and thiocyanate anions (SCN&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;) from guanidinium thiocyanate to produce high-quality MA-free Cs&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;FA&lt;sub&gt;0.9&lt;/sub&gt;Pb&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite films via a simplified antisolvent-free spin-coating process. Ac&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anions retard crystallization and mitigate Sn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; oxidation through the formation of intermediate phases and anion exchange process, while SCN&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; anions further promote crystal growth and stabilize Sn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; via strong coordination interactions, improving energy level alignment and grain boundary management.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mixed tin-lead (Sn-Pb) perovskites are integral to all-perovskite tandem solar cells (TSCs), offering significant potential to surpass the theoretical efficiency limits of single-junction solar cells. However, the rapid crystallization of Sn-Pb perovskite thin films and the propensity of Sn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to oxidize into Sn&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; remain critical challenges, hindering device performance and stability. Herein, it is demonstrated that a multifunctional dual-anion synergistic regulation strategy to fabricate high-quality MA-free Cs&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;FA&lt;sub&gt;0.9&lt;/sub&gt;Pb&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite thin films with superior morphology and crystallinity via a simplified antisolvent-free spin-coating process. Acetate anions (Ac&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) derived from formamidinium acetate (FAAc) effectively regulate crystallization kinetics and mitigate Sn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; oxidation via intermediate phase formation and anion exchange process. Simultaneously, the combination of Ac&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and thiocyanate anions (SCN&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) from guanidinium thiocyanate (GuaSCN) promotes larger crystal grain growth and stabilizes Sn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; via strong coordination interactions. The dual-anion strategy effectively minimizes grain boundaries, suppresses non-radiative recombination, and optimizes the energy level alignment at interfaces. As a result, the champion single-junction Sn-Pb perovskite solar cell (PSC) achieves an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.26%, setting a new benchmark for Sn-Pb PSCs fabricated without antisolvent. While all-perovskite TSCs reach 28.07% efficiency with remarkable operational stability, retaining 81% of initial performance after 600 h under maximum power point tracking.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Immobilization of Covalent Triazine Framework into Hydrogels for Photothermal&#8208;Promoted Gas&#8208;Solid Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a novel floatable hydrogen&#8208;freshwater cogeneration hybrid hydrogel featuring a dynamic gas&#8208;solid interface toward photothermal&#8208;assisted photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction is reported. The synergy of photothermal materials and 3D nanostructured hydrogel on covalent triazine framework facilitates solar interfacial evaporation and enhanced hydrogen production, highlighting its great potential for scalable and sustainable solar energy utilization.








Abstract
Organic photocatalysts generally suffer from insufficient near&#8208;infrared light absorption and undesirable photogenerated charge transport properties, resulting in unfavorable hydrogen evolution performance from water splitting. Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is also known to be significantly influenced by the interfacial charge and mass transfer in a catalyst/H2O biphase system. Herein, for the first time, a highly stable and floating hydrogen&#8208;water cogeneration hybrid hydrogel that utilizes&#160;photothermal&#8208;induced interface microenvironment variation to accelerate sluggish photocatalytic water splitting reaction is reported. Supported by solar&#8208;powered interfacial evaporation and efficient vapor generation, the rationally designed hydrogel effectively transforms the conventional liquid&#8208;solid interface into a gas&#8208;solid photocatalytic interface. The presence of gas&#8208;liquid coexistence state offers a disordered and loose hydrogen&#8208;bond network while preserving the proton transfer channel, greatly reducing reaction activation energy and interfacial energy barriers. The improved heat and mass transfer together with optimized charge transfer pathways suppress electron&#8208;hole recombination, the integrated photothermal&#8208;coupled solar photocatalytic hydrogel exhibits excellent operational stability and self&#8208;adaptive rotation in seawater, mitigating salt accumulation and achieving an exceptional vapor generation rate of 4.71&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1 and a hydrogen&#8208;evolving rate of 1961.25&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 under one sun illumination.

         <title>P&#8208;Band Center Engineering of Sulfur to Weaken Fe&#9472;S Bond Toward Superior Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique v&#8208;FeS2@C composite is designed, the spin polarization and S vacancy lift p&#8208;band center (&#603;p) of S, which weakens Fe&#9472;S bond and strengthens Na&#9472;S interaction. The v&#8208;FeS2@C anode exhibits record&#8208;breaking rate capability and long&#8208;life cycle performance. The sodium&#8208;ion full cell delivers the best specific capacity and long cyclic stability, much more superior to that of the other iron&#8208;based sulfides.








Abstract
Iron&#8208;based sulfides are appealing anodes of sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) due to the high theoretical capacity, low&#8208;cost, and excellent mechanical/thermal stability. However, achieving high electrochemical performances in such anodes is hindered by the strong Fe&#9472;S bonds and sluggish kinetics. Here, a unique carbon&#8208;coated iron sulfide composite with abundant S vacancies (v&#8208;FeS2@C) is designed, the spin polarization and S vacancy lift the p&#8208;band center (&#603;
p) of S and then decouple it from the d&#8208;band center (&#603;d) of Fe, which weakens Fe&#9472;S bond and strengthens Na&#9472;S interaction. The obtained v&#8208;FeS2@C anode exhibits ultrahigh rate capability of 438.0 mAh g&#8722;1 at 70 A g&#8722;1 and remarkable long&#8208;life cycle performance (512.5 mAh g&#8722;1 after 8000 cycles at 40 A g&#8722;1). Particularly, the sodium&#8208;ion full cell composed of v&#8208;FeS2@C anode and Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode delivers the best specific capacity (211.5 mAh g&#8722;1 at 40 A g&#8722;1) and long cyclic stability (459.5 mAh g&#8722;1 after 2000 cycles at 5 A g&#8722;1). Such performances are much more superior to those of the other iron&#8208;based sulfides. This work provides a new paradigm for boosting SIBs' performances of iron&#8208;based sulfides by regulating p&#8208;band center (&#603;p) of S and weakening Fe&#9472;S bonds.

         <title>Interface Design of Solid&#8211;Liquid Hybrid Electrodes for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Flexible Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes a novel solid&#8211;liquid hybrid electrode for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density flexible lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The electrode structure includes: an upper liquid metal phase containing silicon microparticles, which can connect fractured silicon and form a stable interface during cycling processes; and a lower solid&#8208;phase copper&#8208;gallium alloy, which ensures the robust adhesion of the electrode to the current collector during flexing processes.








Abstract
The silicon microparticles (SiMPs) offer a promising solution for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion battery systems. However, the inevitable volume expansion (&gt;300%) of SiMPs during alloying often leads to particle breakage, interface rupture, and electrode separation, resulting in rapid capacity decay. Herein, an effective strategy is proposed for designing a novel solid&#8211;liquid hybrid electrode (Si@EGaSn) for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density flexible lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The Si@EGaSn electrode has a liquid&#8208;phase top layer containing SiMPs and a solid&#8208;phase copper gallium alloy bottom layer. The top layer can not only electrically connect the fractured SiMPs, but also form a stable solid electrolyte interface during alloying processes. The bottom layer can firmly adhere the electrodes to the current collector. Consequently, the optimal Si@EGaSn electrode delivers a highly reversible capacity of 767.1 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 A g&#8722;1 and a high capacity retention of &gt;99% during 200 cycles. After loading the electrode into metallic textiles, the assembled high&#8208;voltage pouch cell of NCM811//Si@EGaSn shows a high areal capacity of 3.2 mAh cm&#8722;2, high volumetric energy density of 500&#160;Wh L&#8722;1 and negligible capacity decay during 3000 flexing cycles at a small bending radius of 4.0&#160;mm. This work provides a new electrode design approach to achieve high&#8208;energy&#8208;density flexible lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Resonant Levels Induced Seebeck Coefficient Matching Contributes to High Thermoelectric Cooling Efficiency in p&#8208;type SnSe Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study proposed that doping indium (In) in p&#8208;type SnSe introduced resonant levels near the Fermi level in the valence bands, effectively enhancing the local density of states and significantly boosting the Seebeck coefficient. These improvements result in extraordinary near&#8208;room&#8208;temperature thermoelectric performances. Specifically, the optimal SnSe&#8208;0.7%In sample achieved a PF of &#8776;55 &#181;Wcm&#8722;1K&#8722;2, and a ZT of &#8776;1.0 at 300 K.








Abstract
Tin selenide (SnSe) has emerged as a promising thermoelectric cooling candidate, exhibiting room&#8208;temperature performance comparable to that of commercial bismuth telluride (Bi2Te3). However, the Seebeck coefficient of p&#8208;type SnSe crystals remains significantly lower than that of n&#8208;type Bi&#8322;(Te, Se)&#8323; (BTS), and the resulting mismatches hinder effective utilization of its excellent cooling potential. To address this limitation, resonant levels are introduced in the valence bands of hole&#8208;doped SnSe through indium&#8208;doping, which increased the density of states and thereby boosted the Seebeck coefficient. This strategy enable the power factor to reach &#8776;55 &#181;Wcm&#8722;1K&#8722;2 and ZT value of &#8776;1.0 at 300 K, with a more matching Seebeck coefficient of &#8776;211 &#181;VK&#8722;1. Furthermore, a full&#8208;scale thermoelectric cooler incorporating the p&#8208;type SnSe paired with n&#8208;type BTS demonstrated a maximum cooling temperature difference (&#916;Tmax) of &#8776;81.1 K at 343 K. A SnSe&#8208;based single&#8208;leg device achieve a conversion efficiency of &#8776;7.0% under a &#916;T of 250 K. These findings highlight that matching thermoelectric parameter of p&#8208;type and n&#8208;type materials is crucial for enhancing the cooling efficiency of devices, and engineering resonant energy levels constitutes a robust strategy for solving the inherent performance limitations of p&#8208;type SnSe in practical thermoelectric applications.

         <title>Decoupling Self&#8208;Matching Effect Between Cathode and Anode in Hybrid Electrochemical Capacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study decouples the effects of cathode&#8208;anode matching and coupling on performance of a system in hybrid electrochemical capacitors (HECs) which are like black boxes. By modulating the three&#8208;electrode mode to focus on the self&#8208;matching effect of cathode&#8208;anode potentials ranges, the matching and coupling is correlated with current, providing a guiding principle for predicting and optimizing the performance of HECs based on electrode.








Abstract
Hybrid electrochemical capacitors (HECs) are advanced energy storage devices that offer high energy density, high power density, and long cycle life by integrating the energy storage mechanisms of both batteries and supercapacitors. The electrochemical coupling resulting from the cathode&#8208;anode kinetic differences severely restricts the accuracy of predicting the performance of HECs based on electrode performance. However, no general method can decouple the effects of cathode&#8208;anode kinetics matching on electrochemical performance by integrating electrochemical coupling from an electrochemical perspective. Here, using an integrated method that combines two distinct three&#8208;electrode testing modes in the typical sodium&#8208;ion hybrid capacitors, the self&#8208;matching effect of cathode&#8208;anode working potential ranges is first refined as the foundation for kinetic matching and electrochemical coupling. The discrepancies and interdependencies in cathode&#8208;anode electrochemical coupling for an individual kinetic match are decoupled by examining the impact of the self&#8208;matching effect on the electrochemical results. The critical matching current density is introduced as a key kinetic parameter for evaluating the degree of cathode&#8208;anode matching in complex electrochemical systems. This advancement provides an innovative design principle for electrode matching and coupling in high&#8208;performance HECs.

         <title>Recent Advances in Moir&#233; Superlattice Systems by Angle&#8208;Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Artificial moir&#233; superlattices have become a fertile playground for emergent quantum phenomena. Modern angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) can directly visualize electronic structures and thus can provide enlightening insights into fundamental physics in moir&#233; superlattice systems and guides for designing novel devices. Major advances in the ARPES studies of moir&#233; superlattices are reviewed and new experimental directions are discussed.








Abstract
The last decade has witnessed a flourish in 2D materials including graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) as atomic&#8208;scale Legos. Artificial moir&#233; superlattices via stacking 2D materials with a twist angle and/or a lattice mismatch have recently become a fertile playground exhibiting a plethora of emergent properties beyond their building blocks. These rich quantum phenomena stem from their nontrivial electronic structures that are effectively tuned by the moir&#233; periodicity. Modern angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) can directly visualize electronic structures with decent momentum, energy, and spatial resolution, thus can provide enlightening insights into fundamental physics in moir&#233; superlattice systems and guides for designing novel devices. In this review, first, a brief introduction is given on advanced ARPES techniques and basic ideas of band structures in a moir&#233; superlattice system. Then ARPES research results of various moir&#233; superlattice systems are highlighted, including graphene on substrates with small lattice mismatches, twisted graphene/TMD moir&#233; systems, and high&#8208;order moir&#233; superlattice systems. Finally, it discusses important questions that remain open, challenges in current experimental investigations, and presents an outlook on this field of research.

         <title>Emerging Bioprinting for Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, a series of bioprinting techniques, polymer&#8208;based inks, and bioprinted devices are presented for wound healing. Recent advances in this cutting&#8208;edge field, including seven modification strategies of bioprinted devices and the clinical needs they address are summarized and discussed. Several frontiers of bioprinting, challenges, and future directions are highlighted and prospected.








Abstract
Bioprinting has attracted much attention due to its suitability for fabricating biomedical devices. In particular, bioprinting has become one of the growing centers in the field of wound healing, with various types of bioprinted devices being developed, including 3D scaffolds, microneedle patches, and flexible electronics. Bioprinted devices can be designed with specific biostructures and biofunctions that closely match the shape of wound sites and accelerate the regeneration of skin through various approaches. Herein, a comprehensive review of the bioprinting of smart wound dressings is presented, emphasizing the crucial effect of bioprinting in determining biostructures and biofunctions. The review begins with an overview of bioprinting techniques and bioprinted devices, followed with an in&#8208;depth discussion of polymer&#8208;based inks, modification strategies, additive ingredients, properties, and applications. The strategies for the modification of bioprinted devices are divided into seven categories, including chemical synthesis of novel inks, physical blending, coaxial bioprinting, multimaterial bioprinting, physical absorption, chemical immobilization, and hybridization with living cells, and examples are presented. Thereafter, the frontiers of bioprinting and wound healing, including 4D bioprinting, artificial intelligence&#8208;assisted bioprinting, and in situ bioprinting, are discussed from a perspective of interdisciplinary sciences. Finally, the current challenges and future prospects in this field are highlighted.

         <title>Conversion&#8208;Type Cathode Materials for Aqueous Zn Metal Batteries in Nonalkaline Aqueous Electrolytes: Progress, Challenges, and Solutions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conversion&#8208;type cathode materials for aqueous Zn metal batteries in nonalkaline electrolytes can enable higher capacities and energy densities than conventional intercalated cathode materials. This review summarizes the reaction mechanisms, progress, challenges, and solutions of these four kinds of conversion&#8208;type cathode materials (MnO2, halogen materials, chalcogenide materials, and Cu&#8208;based compounds), and proposes some suggestions for their developments.








Abstract
Aqueous Zn metal batteries are attractive as safe and low&#8208;cost energy storage systems. At present, due to the narrow window of the aqueous electrolyte and the strong reliance of the Zn2+ ion intercalated reaction on the host structure, the current intercalated cathode materials exhibit restricted energy densities. In contrast, cathode materials with conversion reactions can promise higher energy densities. Especially, the recently reported conversion&#8208;type cathode materials that function in nonalkaline electrolytes have garnered increasing attention. This is because the use of nonalkaline electrolytes can prevent the occurrence of side reactions encountered in alkaline electrolytes and thereby enhance cycling stability. However, there is a lack of comprehensive review on the reaction mechanisms, progress, challenges, and solutions to these cathode materials. In this review, four kinds of conversion&#8208;type cathode materials including MnO2, halogen materials (Br2 and I2), chalcogenide materials (O2, S, Se, and Te), and Cu&#8208;based compounds (CuI, Cu2O, Cu2S, CuO, CuS, and CuSe) are reviewed. First, the reaction mechanisms and battery structures of these materials are introduced. Second, the fundamental problems and their corresponding solutions are discussed in detail in each material. Finally, future directions and efforts for the development of conversion&#8208;type cathode materials for aqueous Zn batteries are proposed.

This review surveys recent progress and proposes future prospects on 2D ferroic materials for nonvolatile memory applications, including 2D spintronic devices, 2D ferroelectric devices, and 2D multiferroic devices.








Abstract
The emerging nonvolatile memory technologies based on ferroic materials are promising for producing high&#8208;speed, low&#8208;power, and high&#8208;density memory in the field of&#160;integrated circuits. Long&#8208;range ferroic orders observed in 2D materials have triggered extensive research interest in 2D magnets, 2D ferroelectrics, 2D multiferroics, and their device applications. Devices based on 2D ferroic materials and heterostructures with an atomically smooth interface and ultrathin thickness have exhibited impressive properties and significant potential for developing advanced nonvolatile memory. In this context, a systematic review of emergent 2D ferroic materials is conducted here, emphasizing their recent research on nonvolatile memory applications, with a view to proposing brighter prospects for 2D magnetic materials, 2D ferroelectric materials, 2D multiferroic materials, and their relevant devices.

         <title>Functional Materials for Subcellular Targeting Strategies in Cancer Therapy: Progress and Prospects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review investigates eight targeting strategies of functional materials that specifically target subcellular structures in tumor cells, including mitochondria, nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, lysosome, Golgiosome, cytomembrane, and multi&#8208;organelle targeting strategies, and covers a wide range of functional materials, such as liposomes, metal nanoparticles, metal&#8208;organic frameworks, dendrimer nanoplatforms, carbon nanotubes, mitochondria&#8208;targeting mesoporous silica nanoparticles, carbon QD, amphiphilic copolymers, and small molecular compounds.








Abstract
Neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapies have made significant progress in cancer treatment. However, tumor adjuvant therapy still faces challenges due to the intrinsic heterogeneity of cancer, genomic instability, and the formation of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Functional materials possess unique biological properties such as long circulation times, tumor&#8208;specific targeting, and immunomodulation. The combination of functional materials with natural substances and nanotechnology has led to the development of smart biomaterials with multiple functions, high biocompatibilities, and negligible immunogenicities, which can be used for precise cancer treatment. Recently, subcellular structure&#8208;targeting functional materials have received particular attention in various biomedical applications including the diagnosis, sensing, and imaging of tumors and drug delivery. Subcellular organelle&#8208;targeting materials can precisely accumulate therapeutic agents in organelles, considerably reduce the threshold dosages of therapeutic agents, and minimize drug&#8208;related side effects. This review provides a systematic and comprehensive overview of the research progress in subcellular organelle&#8208;targeted cancer therapy based on functional nanomaterials. Moreover, it explains the challenges and prospects of subcellular organelle&#8208;targeting functional materials in precision oncology. The review will serve as an excellent cutting&#8208;edge guide for researchers in the field of subcellular organelle&#8208;targeted cancer therapy.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The up&#8208;to&#8208;date growth strategies for the controlled synthesis of wafer&#8208;scale 2D semiconducting TMDCs polycrystalline and single&#8208;crystal films are systematically summarized. The large&#8208;area accurate doping of 2D semiconducting TMDCs and its effect on the device performances are discussed. The challenges regarding the improvement of electronic device performances of 2D semiconducting TMDCs are highlighted, and the further research directions are proposed.








Abstract
2D semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDCs) possess atomically thin thickness, a dangling&#8208;bond&#8208;free surface, flexible band structure, and silicon&#8208;compatible feature, making them one of the most promising channels for constructing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art field&#8208;effect transistors in the post&#8208;Moore's era. However, the existing 2D semiconducting TMDCs fall short of meeting the industry criteria for practical applications in electronics due to their small domain size and the lack of an effective approach to modulate intrinsic physical properties. Therefore, it is crucial to prepare and dope 2D semiconducting TMDCs single crystals with wafer size. In this review, the up&#8208;to&#8208;date progress regarding the wafer&#8208;scale growth of 2D semiconducting TMDC polycrystalline and single&#8208;crystal films is systematically summarized. The domain orientation control of 2D TMDCs and the seamless stitching of unidirectionally aligned 2D islands by means of substrate design are proposed. In addition, the accurate and uniform doping of 2D semiconducting TMDCs and the effect on electronic device performances are also discussed. Finally, the dominating challenges pertaining to the enhancement of the electronic device performances of TMDCs are emphasized, and further development directions are put forward. This review provides a systematic and in&#8208;depth summary of high&#8208;performance device applications of 2D semiconducting TMDCs.

         <title>Nanoparticle&#8208;Based Photothermal Therapy for Breast Cancer Noninvasive Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper discusses the photothermal properties and biological mechanisms of nanomaterials, emphasizing a clinical and biological perspective. The primary focus is on current research regarding photothermal nanoparticles for breast cancer treatment: nanoparticle materials, breast characteristics, functional design, and commonly used adjuvant therapy in clinical practice.








Abstract
Rapid advancements in materials science and nanotechnology, intertwined with oncology, have positioned photothermal therapy (PTT) as a promising noninvasive treatment strategy for cancer. The breast's superficial anatomical location and aesthetic significance render breast cancer a particularly pertinent candidate for the clinical application of PTT following melanoma. This review comprehensively explores the research conducted on the various types of nanoparticles employed in PTT for breast cancer and elaborates on their specific roles and mechanisms of action. The integration of PTT with existing clinical therapies for breast cancer is scrutinized, underscoring its potential for synergistic outcomes. Additionally, the mechanisms underlying PTT and consequential modifications to the tumor microenvironment after treatment are elaborated from a medical perspective. Future research directions are suggested, with an emphasis on the development of integrative platforms that combine multiple therapeutic approaches and the optimization of nanoparticle synthesis for enhanced treatment efficacy. The goal is to push the boundaries of PTT toward a comprehensive, clinically applicable treatment for breast cancer.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rapid advancements in materials science and nanotechnology, intertwined with oncology, have positioned photothermal therapy (PTT) as a promising noninvasive treatment strategy for cancer. The breast's superficial anatomical location and aesthetic significance render breast cancer a particularly pertinent candidate for the clinical application of PTT following melanoma. This review comprehensively explores the research conducted on the various types of nanoparticles employed in PTT for breast cancer and elaborates on their specific roles and mechanisms of action. The integration of PTT with existing clinical therapies for breast cancer is scrutinized, underscoring its potential for synergistic outcomes. Additionally, the mechanisms underlying PTT and consequential modifications to the tumor microenvironment after treatment are elaborated from a medical perspective. Future research directions are suggested, with an emphasis on the development of integrative platforms that combine multiple therapeutic approaches and the optimization of nanoparticle synthesis for enhanced treatment efficacy. The goal is to push the boundaries of PTT toward a comprehensive, clinically applicable treatment for breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hemoperfusion Adsorbents for Removal of Common Toxins in Liver and Kidney Failure: Recent Progress, Challenges, and Prospects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liver and kidney failure leads to the accumulation of toxic metabolites such as bilirubin, blood ammonia, endotoxin, and creatinine in the blood and tissues, which aggravate the progression of the disease. Hemoperfusion can effectively adsorb and remove toxins by extracorporeal system. Carbon materials, zeolites, MXenes, polymer materials, composite materials, porous materials, etc. have been developed as hemoperfusion adsorbents to remove common toxins in liver and kidney failure and to treat liver and kidney failure.








Abstract
Liver and kidney failure can lead to extensive accumulation of toxic metabolites in the blood and tissues, such as bilirubin, blood ammonia, endotoxins, cytokines, creatinine, uric acid, and urea, which aggravate the progression of the disease. Hemoperfusion can effectively adsorb and remove toxins from the blood and treat liver and kidney failure. However, the adsorption efficiency and safety of traditional hemoperfusion adsorbents are not ideal. Thus, it is urgent to develop adsorbents with good blood compatibility, as well as high adsorption and strong selective capacities, to fulfill the clinical needs. In recent years, new hemoperfusion adsorbents with improved adsorption performance and good blood compatibility have been developed. This review classifies and summarizes the recent research progress in hemoperfusion adsorbents for common blood toxins (bilirubin, blood ammonia, endotoxins, cytokines, creatinine, uric acid, and urea) produced by liver and kidney failure. The composition and structure of various toxin adsorbents, toxin adsorption performance, biocompatibility, blood safety, and the adsorption mechanisms of toxins are discussed. Based on a summary of recent studies, feasible strategies have been explored for designing and preparing hemoperfusion adsorbents to fulfill future development requirements. The trends and clinical application prospects of various toxin adsorbents are also discussed.

         <title>Machine Learning Paves the Way for High Entropy Compounds Exploration: Challenges, Progress, and Outlook</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine learning (ML) revolutionizes high entropy compounds (HECs) research, addressing their complex structures. It models HEC at atomic and macroscopic levels, using various algorithms. Accurate data, feature engineering, and cross&#8208;validation are key for robust models. ML's potential in HEC exploration is significant, driving Artificial&#8208;intelliegence&#8208;assisted material discovery.








Abstract
Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool in the research field of high entropy compounds (HECs), which have gained worldwide attention due to their vast compositional space and abundant regulatability. However, the complex structure space of HEC poses challenges to traditional experimental and computational approaches, necessitating the adoption of machine learning. Microscopically, machine learning can model the Hamiltonian of the HEC system, enabling atomic&#8208;level property investigations, while macroscopically, it can analyze macroscopic material characteristics such as hardness, melting point, and ductility. Various machine learning algorithms, both traditional methods and deep neural networks, can be employed in HEC research. Comprehensive and accurate data collection, feature engineering, and model training and selection through cross&#8208;validation are crucial for establishing excellent ML models. ML also holds promise in analyzing phase structures and stability, constructing potentials in simulations, and facilitating the design of functional materials. Although some domains, such as magnetic and device materials, still require further exploration, machine learning's potential in HEC research is substantial. Consequently, machine learning has become an indispensable tool in understanding and exploiting the capabilities of HEC, serving as the foundation for the new paradigm of Artificial&#8208;intelligence&#8208;assisted material exploration.

         <title>Rational Designs of Biomaterials for Combating Oral Biofilm Infections</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intractable oral biofilms are the chief culprits of both dental infections and systemic inflammation, posing a great threat to human health. In this review, core strategies of recently developed biomaterials in eradicating oral biofilm are present. Furthermore, design rationales of biomaterials with advanced antibiofilm capacity, as well as versatile antibiofilm biomaterials with other functions are comprehensively summarized.








Abstract
Oral biofilms, which are also known as dental plaque, are the culprit of a wide range of oral diseases and systemic diseases, thus contributing to serious health risks. The manner of how to achieve good control of oral biofilms has been an increasing public concern. Novel antimicrobial biomaterials with highly controllable fabrication and functionalization have been proven to be promising candidates. However, previous reviews have generally emphasized the physicochemical properties, action mode, and application effectiveness of those biomaterials, whereas insufficient attention has been given to the design rationales tailored to different infection types and application scenarios. To offer guidance for better diversification and functionalization of anti&#8208;oral&#8208;biofilm biomaterials, this review details the up&#8208;to&#8208;date design rationales in three aspects: the core strategies in combating oral biofilm, as well as the biomaterials with advanced antibiofilm capacity and multiple functions based on the improvement or combination of the abovementioned antimicrobial strategies. Thereafter, insights on the existing challenges and future improvement of biomaterial&#8208;assisted oral biofilm treatments are proposed, hoping to provide a theoretical basis and reference for the subsequent design and application of antibiofilm biomaterials.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the recent advances on lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for precision diagnosis and treatment of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) are comprehensively summarized. The chemical compositions of LNPs and the modification strategies for enhanced tumor target are introduced. After that, the authors&#8217; ongoing and foreseeable biomedical applications are discussed and prospected.








Abstract
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a common urological malignancy and represents a leading threat to healthcare. Recent years have seen a series of progresses in the early diagnosis and management of RCC. Theranostic lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are increasingly becoming one of the focuses in this field, because of their suitability for tumor targeting and multimodal therapy. LNPs can be precisely fabricated with desirable chemical compositions and biomedical properties, which closely match the physiological characteristics and clinical needs of RCC. Herein, a comprehensive review of theranostic LNPs is presented, emphasizing the generic tool nature of LNPs in developing advanced micro&#8208;nano biomaterials. It begins with a brief overview of the compositions and formation mechanism of LNPs, followed with an introduction to kidney&#8208;targeting approaches, such as passive, active, and stimulus responsive targeting. With examples provided, a series of modification strategies for enhancing the tumor targeting and functionality of LNPs are discussed. Thereafter, research advances on applications of these LNPs for RCC including bioimaging, liquid biopsy, drug delivery, physical therapy, and gene therapy are summarized and discussed from an interdisciplinary perspective. The final part highlights the milestone achievements of translation medicine, current challenges as well as future development directions of LNPs for the diagnosis and treatment of RCC.

         <title>Geometric Control and Optical Properties of Intrinsically Chiral Plasmonic Nanomaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in intrinsically chiral plasmonic nanomaterials have provided great opportunities for many promising applications. Here, the geometric control and optical properties of chiral plasmonic nanomaterials are circumnavigated and widen the scope of their potential applications. It is envisioned that these studies will pave the way toward the rational design of chiral nanomaterials with desired optical properties for emerging applications.








Abstract
Intrinsically chiral plasmonic nanomaterials exhibit intriguing geometry&#8208;dependent chiroptical properties, which is due to the combination of plasmonic features with geometric chirality. Thus, chiral plasmonic nanomaterials have become promising candidates for applications in biosensing, asymmetric catalysis, biomedicine, photonics, etc. Recent advances in geometric control and optical tuning of intrinsically chiral plasmonic nanomaterials have further opened up a unique opportunity for their widespread applications in many emerging technological areas. Here, the recent developments in the geometric control of chiral plasmonic nanomaterials are reviewed with special attention given to the quantitative understanding of the chiroptical structure&#8208;property relationship. Several important optical spectroscopic tools for characterizing the optical chirality of plasmonic nanomaterials at both ensemble and single&#8208;particle levels are also discussed. Three emerging applications of chiral plasmonic nanomaterials, including enantioselective sensing, enantioselective catalysis, and biomedicine, are further highlighted. It is envisioned that these advanced studies in chiral plasmonic nanomaterials will pave the way toward the rational design of chiral nanomaterials with desired optical properties for diverse emerging technological applications.

         <title>The Key Role of Molecular Packing in Luminescence Property: From Adjacent Molecules to Molecular Aggregates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review mainly discusses the molecular aggregation science behind luminescence materials. From the basic packing modes of adjacent molecules to the various aggregated structures, the efficient bridge between molecular structures and luminescence property has been roughly built to promote their development from internal to external.








Abstract
The luminescence materials act as the key components in many functional devices, as well as the detection and imaging systems, which can be permeated in each aspect of modern life, and attract more and more attention for the creative technology and applications. In addition to the diverse properties of organic luminogens, the multiple molecular packing at aggregated states frequently offers new and/or exciting performance. However, there still lacks comprehensive analysis of molecular packing in these organic materials, resulting in an increased gap between molecular design and practical applications. In this review, from the basic knowledge of organic compounds as single molecules, to the discernable property of excimer, charge transfer (CT) complex or self&#8208;assembly systems by adjacent molecules, and finally to the opto&#8208;electronic performance of molecular aggregates, the relevant factors to molecular packing and practical applications are discussed.

         <title>Lightning the Spin: Harnessing the Potential of 2D Magnets in Opto&#8208;Spintronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D magnets provide diverse magnetic orders for spins to be aligned, including intralayer ferromagnetism, antiferromagnetism, and interlayer (A&#8208;type) antiferromagnetism, which allow the spins to precess in a wide range of frequency from GHz to X&#8208;ray. By interacting with the given wavelength of light/electromagnetic wave, the spins can be excited (written) and detected (read), realizing different types of opto&#8208;spintronic devices and functions.








Abstract
Since the emergence of 2D magnets in 2017, the diversity of these materials has greatly expanded. Their 2D nature (atomic&#8208;scale thickness) endows these magnets with strong magnetic anisotropy, layer&#8208;dependent and switchable magnetic order, and quantum&#8208;confined quasiparticles, which distinguish them from conventional 3D magnetic materials. Moreover, the 2D geometry facilitates light incidence for opto&#8208;spintronic applications and potential on&#8208;chip integration. In analogy to optoelectronics based on optical&#8211;electronic interactions, opto&#8208;spintronics use light&#8208;spin interactions to process spin information stored in the solid state. In this review, opto&#8208;spintronics is divided into three types with respect to the wavelengths of radiation interacting with 2D magnets: 1) GHz (microwave) to THz (mid&#8208;infrared), 2) visible, and 3) UV to X&#8208;rays. It is focused on the recent research advancements on the newly discovered mechanisms of light&#8208;spin interactions in 2D magnets and introduces the potential design of novel opto&#8208;spintronic applications based on these interactions.

         <title>A Monolayer High&#8208;Entropy Layered Hydroxide Frame for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A monolayer high&#8208;entropy layered hydroxide (HELH) frame is prepared by in situ conversion from Zn,Co&#8208;ZIF under a mild environment. The HELH with tailored geometric structure provides a guideline for designing advanced electrocatalysts. It also provides a new insight into the field of fine regulation of high&#8208;entropy material structure.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy materials with tailored geometric and elemental compositions provide a guideline for designing advanced electrocatalysts. Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are the most efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst. However, due to the huge difference in ionic solubility product, an extremely strong alkali environment is necessary to prepare high&#8208;entropy layered hydroxides (HELHs), which results in an uncontrollable structure, poor stability, and scarce active sites. Here, a universal synthesis of monolayer HELH frame in a mild environment is presented, regardless of the solubility product limit. Mild reaction conditions allow this study to precisely control the fine structure and elemental composition of the final product. Consequently, the surface area of the HELHs is up to 380.5&#160;m2&#160;g&#8722;1. The current density of 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 is achieved in 1&#160;m KOH at an overpotential of 259&#160;mV, and, after 1000&#160;h operation at the current density of 20&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, the catalytic performance shows no obvious deterioration. The high&#8208;entropy engineering and fine nanostructure control open opportunities to solve the problems of low intrinsic activity, very few active sites, instability, and low conductance during OER for LDH catalysts.

         <title>AIEgen&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Preventing Malignant Ventricular Arrhythmias Via Local Hyperthermia Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of AIEgen&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks are constructed with a unique &#8220;one stone, two birds&#8221; functionality, which is not only efficient in directly modulating the function and neural activity of stellate ganglion (SG) through local hyperthermia therapy, but also further inducing browning of white fat and ameliorating the neuroinflammation of peri&#8208;SG, favorable for inhibiting malignant ventricular arrhythmias.








Abstract
The engineering of aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgen) based covalent organic frameworks (COFs), TDTA&#8208;COF, BTDTA&#8208;COF, and BTDBETA&#8208;COF are reported, as hyperthermia agents for inhibiting the occurrence of malignant ventricular arrhythmias (VAs). These AIE COFs exhibit dual functionality, as they not only directly modulate the function and neural activity of stellate ganglion (SG) through local hyperthermia therapy (LHT) but also induce the browning of white fat and improve the neuroinflammation peri&#8208;SG microenvironment, which is favorable for inhibiting ischemia&#8208;induced VAs. In vivo studies have confirmed that BTDBETA&#8208;COF&#8208;mediated LHT enhances thermogenesis and browning&#8208;related gene expression, thereby serving a synergistic role in combating VAs. Transcriptome analysis of peri&#8208;SG adipose tissue reveals a substantial downregulation of inflammatory cytokines, highlighting the potency of BTDBETA&#8208;COF&#8208;mediated LHT in ameliorating the neuroinflammation peri&#8208;SG microenvironment and offering myocardial and arrhythmia protection. The work on AIE COF&#8208;based hyperthermia agent for VAs inhibition provides a new avenue for mitigating cardiac sympathetic nerve hyperactivity.

         <title>Microenvironment&#8208;Regulating Drug Delivery Nanoparticles for Treating and Preventing Typical Biofilm&#8208;Induced Oral Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Most of the infectious diseases in the oral cavity are based on disturbances in the bacterial&#8208;cellular microenvironment. In this work, a microenvironment&#8208;targeted drug delivery nanoparticle is prepared to inhibit bacterial adhesion to surfaces, modulate macrophage polarization, and produce photodynamic and photothermal effects. It performs antibacterial, anti&#8208;biofilm, and anti&#8208;inflammation effects to achieve the treatment and prevention for typical biofilm&#8208;induced oral diseases.








Abstract
The oral cavity comprises an environment full of microorganisms. Dysregulation of this microbial&#8208;cellular microenvironment will lead to a series of oral diseases, such as implant&#8208;associated infection caused by Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) biofilms and periodontitis initiated by Streptococcus oralis (S. oralis). In this study, a liposome&#8208;encapsulated indocyanine green (ICG) and rapamycin drug&#8208;delivery nanoparticle (ICG&#8208;rapamycin) is designed to treat and prevent two typical biofilm&#8208;induced oral diseases by regulating the microbial&#8208;cellular microenvironment. ICG&#8208;rapamycin elevates the reactive oxygen species (ROS) and temperature levels to facilitate photodynamic and photothermal mechanisms under near&#8208;infrared (NIR) laser irradiation for anti&#8208;bacteria. In addition, it prevents biofilm formation by promoting bacterial motility with increasing the ATP levels. The nanoparticles modulate the microbial&#8208;cellular interaction to reduce cellular inflammation and enhance bacterial clearance, which includes promoting the M2 polarization of macrophages, upregulating the anti&#8208;inflammatory factor TGF&#8208;&#946;, and enhancing the bacterial phagocytosis of macrophages. Based on these findings, ICG&#8208;rapamycin is applied to implant&#8208;infected and periodontitis animal models to confirm the effects in vivo. This study demonstrates that ICG&#8208;rapamycin can treat and prevent biofilm&#8208;induced oral diseases by regulating the microbial&#8208;cellular microenvironment, thus providing a promising strategy for future clinical applications.

         <title>Versatile Synthesis of Hollow&#8208;Structured Mesoporous Carbons by Enhanced Surface Interaction for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hollow&#8208;structured mesoporous carbons with ultrahigh surface area, large pore volume and heteroatom doping are synthesized by a versatile and general silanol&#8208;assisted surface&#8208;casting method. The materials display remarkable electrochemical performance for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The studies reveal that strong interactions between the organic molecules and the silanol&#8208;rich surface of the silica template are crucial.








Abstract
Nanoporous carbons are very attractive for various applications including energy storage. Templating methods with assembled amphiphilic molecules or porous inorganic templates are typically used for the synthesis. Amongst the different members of this family, CMK&#8208;5&#8208;like structures that are constructed to consist of sub&#8208;10&#160;nm amorphous carbon nanotubes and ultrahigh specific surface area due to their thin pore walls, have the best properties in various respects. However, the fabrication of such hollow&#8208;structured mesoporous carbons entails elaborately tailoring the surface properties of the template pore walls and selecting specific carbon precursors. Thus, very limited cases are successful. Herein, a versatile and general silanol&#8208;assisted surface&#8208;casting method to create hollow&#8208;structured mesoporous carbons and heteroatom&#8208;doped derivatives with numerous organic molecules (e.g., furfuryl alcohol, resol, 2&#8208;thiophene methanol, dopamine, tyrosine) and different structural templates is reported. These carbon materials exhibit ultrahigh surface area (2400&#160;m2&#160;g&#8722;1), large pore volume (4.0&#160;cm3&#160;g&#8722;1), as well as satisfactory lithium&#8208;storage capacity (1460&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1), excellent rate capability (320&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1), and very outstanding cycling performance (2000 cycles at 5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1).

&lt;p&gt;Hollow-structured mesoporous carbons with ultrahigh surface area, large pore volume and heteroatom doping are synthesized by a versatile and general silanol-assisted surface-casting method. The materials display remarkable electrochemical performance for lithium-ion batteries. The studies reveal that strong interactions between the organic molecules and the silanol-rich surface of the silica template are crucial.

&lt;p&gt;Nanoporous carbons are very attractive for various applications including energy storage. Templating methods with assembled amphiphilic molecules or porous inorganic templates are typically used for the synthesis. Amongst the different members of this family, CMK-5-like structures that are constructed to consist of sub-10&#160;nm amorphous carbon nanotubes and ultrahigh specific surface area due to their thin pore walls, have the best properties in various respects. However, the fabrication of such hollow-structured mesoporous carbons entails elaborately tailoring the surface properties of the template pore walls and selecting specific carbon precursors.

Herein, a versatile and general silanol-assisted surface-casting method to create hollow-structured mesoporous carbons and heteroatom-doped derivatives with numerous organic molecules (e.g., furfuryl alcohol, resol, 2-thiophene methanol, dopamine, tyrosine) and different structural templates is reported.

         <title>Single&#8208;Nanoparticle&#8208;Based Nanomachining for Fabrication of a Uniform Nanochannel Sensor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The retention of individual gold nanoparticles on a substrate, enabling single&#8208;nanoparticle nanomachining, is enabled via a simple and versatile strategy. This method involves three steps: the formation of a carbon protective layer on individual nanoparticle via electron&#8208;beam irradiation, selective removal of unprotected nanoparticles using a corrosive agent, and subsequent elimination of the carbon layer. This enables the fabrication of a single micrometer&#8208;long uniform through nanochannel in the silicon wafer, which can be employed for nanopore sensing and shape&#8208;based nanoparticle distinguishing.








Abstract
The structure of nanomaterials and nanodevices determines their functionality and applications. A single uniform nanochannel with a high aspect ratio is an attractive structure due to its unique rigid structures, easy preparation, and diverse pore structures and it holds significant promising importance in fields such as nanopore sensing and nanomanufacturing. Although the metal&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;assistant silicon etching technique can produce uniform nanochannels, however, the fabrication of single through nanochannels remains a challenge thus far. A simple and versatile strategy is developed that allows for the retention of individual gold nanoparticle on a substrate, enabling single&#8208;nanoparticle nanomachining. This method involves three steps: the formation of a carbon protective layer on individual nanoparticles via electron&#8208;beam irradiation, selective removal of unprotected nanoparticles using a corrosive agent, and subsequent elimination of the carbon layer. This enables the fabrication of a single submillimeter&#8208;long uniform through nanochannel in the silicon wafer, which can be employed for nanopore sensing and shape&#8208;based nanoparticle distinguishing. The developed method can also facilitate single&#8208;nanoparticle studies and nanomachining for a broad application in materials science, electronics, micro/nano&#8208;optics, and catalysis.

         <title>Ultrathin Van der Waals Lanthanum Oxychloride Dielectric for 2D Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultrathin van der Waals (vdW) LaOCl is synthesized by controlling the growth kinetics. Due to the considerable dielectric properties of LaOCl and its dangling&#8208;bond&#8208;free surface, the MoS2 field&#8208;effect transistor (FET) with vdW LaOCl dielectric exhibits ultralow hysteresis. LaOCl possesses the tremendous potential to act as an ideal gate dielectric for two&#8208;dimensional FETs.








Abstract
Downsizing silicon&#8208;based transistors can result in lower power consumption, faster speeds, and greater computational capacity, although it is accompanied by the appearance of short&#8208;channel effects. The integration of high&#8208;mobility 2D semiconductor channels with ultrathin high dielectric constant (high&#8208;&#954;) dielectric in transistors is expected to suppress the effect. Nevertheless, the absence of a high&#8208;&#954; dielectric layer featuring an atomically smooth surface devoid of dangling bonds poses a significant obstacle in the advancement of 2D electronics. Here, ultrathin van der Waals (vdW) lanthanum oxychloride (LaOCl) dielectrics are successfully synthesized by precisely controlling the growth kinetics. These dielectrics demonstrate an impressive high&#8208;&#954; value of 10.8 and exhibit a remarkable breakdown field strength (Ebd) exceeding 10 MV cm&#8722;1. Remarkably, the conventional molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) field&#8208;effect transistor (FET) featuring a dielectric made of LaOCl showcases an almost negligible hysteresis when compared to FETs employing alternative gate dielectrics. This can be attributed to the flawlessly formed vdW interface and excellent compatibility established between LaOCl and MoS2. These findings will motivate the further exploration of rare&#8208;earth oxychlorides and the development of more&#8208;than&#8208;Moore nanoelectronic devices.

Properties of LM and its application in the diagnosis and treatment of CVDs.








Abstract
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remains a leading cause of high mortality and imposes a significant health burden globally. The biocompatibility between materials and the cardiovascular system, encompassing biological safety, modulus matching, and anti&#8208;fatigue performance in dynamic physiological environments, has been a critical challenge in the diagnosis and treatment of CVDs. The emergence of liquid metal (LM) offers promising opportunities to develop diagnostic and therapeutic methods that exhibit excellent biocompatibility with the cardiovascular system. In this perspective, the progress of LM applications in contrast agents, nanomedicine, implantable and wearable bioelectronic devices, and bionic materials is evaluated, providing a comprehensive and in&#8208;depth discussion of the role and advantages of LM in CVDs management. Finally, the current challenges and future prospects of LM in the field of CVDs diagnosis and treatment are outlined.

         <title>Routes to Electrochemically Stable Sulfur Cathodes for Practical Li&#8211;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#8220;quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state reaction&#8221; mechanism can enable the redox reaction of sulfur to proceed in a solid&#8208;phase conversion manner in liquid electrolytes without the generation and dissolution of polysulfide intermediates at cycling, and therefore is a promising approach to develop high&#8208;capacity and cycle&#8208;stable sulfur cathodes for practical lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries have been investigated intensively as a post&#8208;Li&#8208;ion technology in the past decade; however, their realizable energy density and cycling performance are still far from satisfaction for commercial development. Although many extremely high&#8208;capacity and cycle&#8208;stable S cathodes and Li anodes are reported in literature, their use for practical Li&#8211;S batteries remains challenging due to the huge gap between the laboratory research and industrial applications. The laboratory research is usually conducted by use of a thin&#8208;film electrode with a low sulfur loading and high electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratios, while the practical batteries require a thick/high sulfur loading cathode and a low E/S ratio to achieve a desired energy density. To make this clear, the inherent problems of dissolution/deposition mechanism of conventional sulfur cathodes are analyzed from the viewpoint of polarization theory of porous electrode after a brief overview of the recent research progress on sulfur cathodes of Li&#8211;S batteries, and the possible strategies for building an electrochemically stable sulfur cathode are discussed for practically viable Li&#8211;S batteries from the authors&#8217; own understandings.

To make this clear, the inherent problems of dissolution/deposition mechanism of conventional sulfur cathodes are analyzed from the viewpoint of polarization theory of porous electrode after a brief overview of the recent research progress on sulfur cathodes of Li&#8211;S batteries, and the possible strategies for building an electrochemically stable sulfur cathode are discussed for practically viable Li&#8211;S batteries from the authors&#8217; own understandings.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

An overview of interface engineering strategies to overcome the limitation of the Debye screening effect for the achievement of high&#8208;performance FET&#8208;based electronic devices is proposed, and their applications in biological environment analysis are systematically summarized.








Abstract
Promising advances in molecular medicine have promoted the urgent requirement for reliable and sensitive diagnostic tools. Electronic biosensing devices based on field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) exhibit a wide range of benefits, including rapid and label&#8208;free detection, high sensitivity, easy operation, and capability of integration, possessing significant potential for application in disease screening and health monitoring. In this perspective, the tremendous efforts and achievements in the development of high&#8208;performance FET biosensors in the past decade are summarized, with emphasis on the interface engineering of FET&#8208;based electrical platforms for biomolecule identification. First, an overview of engineering strategies for interface modulation and recognition element design is discussed in detail. For a further step, the applications of FET&#8208;based electrical devices for in vitro detection and real&#8208;time monitoring in biological systems are comprehensively reviewed. Finally, the key opportunities and challenges of FET&#8208;based electronic devices in biosensing are discussed. It is anticipated that a comprehensive understanding of interface engineering strategies in FET biosensors will inspire additional techniques for developing highly sensitive, specific, and stable FET biosensors as well as emerging designs for next&#8208;generation biosensing electronics.

         <title>Materials Strategies Tackling Interfacial Issues in Catalyst Layers of Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective focuses on the latest progresses in material sciences for solving the problems related to the catalyst/ionomer interface in PEMFCs, with particular emphasis put on the effects of materials structures and intermolecular interactions. The content covers catalysts, ionomers, and additives. Based on molecule&#8208;level understanding, the challenges for the application of established materials and opportunities to broaden the material library are proposed.








Abstract
The most critical challenge for the large&#8208;scale commercialization of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), one of the primary hydrogen energy technologies, is to achieve decent output performance with low usage of platinum (Pt). Currently, the performance of PEMFCs is largely limited by two issues at the catalyst/ionomer interface, specifically, the poisoning of active sites of Pt by sulfonate groups and the extremely sluggish local oxygen transport toward Pt. In the past few years, emerging strategies are derived to tackle these interface problems through materials optimization and innovation. This perspective summarizes the latest advances in this regard, and in the meantime unveils the molecule&#8208;level mechanisms behind the materials modulation of interfacial structures. This paper starts with a brief introduction of processes and structures of catalyst/ionomer interfaces, which is followed by a detailed review of progresses in key materials toward interface optimization, including catalysts, ionomers, and additives, with particular emphasis on the role of materials structure in regulating the intermolecular interactions. Finally, the challenges for the application of the established materials and research directions to broaden the material library are highlighted.

         <title>Processability Considerations for Next&#8208;Generation Organic Photovoltaic Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive set of key performance indicators is proposed to address the limitations of current evaluation methods for the processability of organic photovoltaic materials, aiming to guide academic research and enhance industrial processability.








Abstract
The evolution of organic semiconductors for organic photovoltaics (OPVs) has resulted in unforeseen outcomes. This has provided substitute choices of photoactive layer materials, which effectively convert sunlight into electricity. Recently developed OPV materials have narrowed down the gaps in efficiency, stability, and cost in devices. Records now show power conversion efficiency in single&#8208;junction devices closing to 20%. Despite this, there is still a gap between the currently developed OPV materials and those that meet the requirements of practical applications, especially the solution processability issue widely concerned in the field of OPVs. Based on the general rule that structure determines properties, methodologies to enhance the processability of OPV materials are reviewed and explored from the perspective of material design and views&#160;on the further development of processable OPV materials are presented. Considering the current dilemma that the existing evaluation indicators cannot reflect the industrial processability of OPV materials, a more complete set of key performance indicators are proposed&#160;for their processability considerations. The purpose of this perspective is to raise awareness of the boundary conditions that exist in industrial OPV manufacturing and to provide guidance for academic research that aspires to contribute to technological advancements.

         <title>Non&#8208;Hermitian Topological Phononic Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The research of non&#8208;Hermitian physics is in the ascendant and has brought new opportunities for the development of topological metamaterials. This perspective reviews the recent advances in non&#8208;Hermitian topological phononic metamaterials for acoustic wave and mechanical structures. New configurations and mechanisms for skin effect in high&#8208;dimensional non&#8208;Hermitian systems and non&#8208;Hermitian effect for elastic wave metamaterials are worthy of further exploration.








Abstract
Non&#8208;Hermitian (NH) physics describes novel phenomena in open systems that allow generally complex spectra. Introducing NH physics into topological metamaterials, which permits explorations of topological wave phenomena in artificially designed structures, not only enables the experimental verification of exotic NH phenomena in these flexible platforms, but also enriches the manipulation of wave propagation beyond the Hermitian cases. Here, a perspective on the advances in the research of NH topological phononic metamaterials is presented, which covers the exceptional points and their topological geometries, the skin effect related to the topology of complex spectra, the interplay of NH effects and topological states in phononic metamaterials, etc.

         <title>In Situ Twistronics: A New Platform Based on Superlubricity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The burgeoning field of twistronics has been ignited by the straightforward manipulation of interlayer twist between van der Waals layered materials. This perspective highlights the in situ twisting techniques and the underlying superlubricity mechanism, and exemplifies new promising opportunities arising from the intersection of the fields of twistronics, nanotribology, and micro/nano&#8208;electro&#8208;mechanical systems (MEMS/NEMS), etc.








Abstract
Twistronics, an emerging field focused on exploring the unique electrical properties induced by twist interface in graphene multilayers, has garnered significant attention in recent years. The general manipulation of twist angle depends on the assembly of van der Waals (vdW) layered materials, which has led to the discovery of unconventional superconductivity, ferroelectricity, and nonlinear optics, thereby expanding the realm of twistronics. Recently, in situ tuning of interlayer conductivity in vdW layered materials has been achieved based on scanning probe microscope. In this Perspective, the advancements in in situ twistronics are focused on by reviewing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in situ manipulating technology, discussing the underlying mechanism based on the concept of structural superlubricity, and exploiting the real&#8208;time twistronic tests under scanning electron microscope (SEM). It is shown that the real&#8208;time manipulation under SEM allows for visualizing and monitoring the interface status during in situ twistronic testing. By harnessing the unique tribological properties of vdW layered materials, this novel platform not only enhances the fabrication of twistronic devices but also facilitates the fundamental understanding of interface phenomena in vdW layered materials. Moreover, this platform holds great promise for the application of twistronic&#8208;mechanical systems, providing avenues for the integration of twistronics into various mechanical frameworks.
