         <title>Liquid Bridges Mediate Crack Initiation, Propagation, and Coalescence to Suppress Film Failure within Flexible Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold films deposited on capillary&#8208;stabilized fluidic cushion of ionic&#8208;liquid&#8208;infused nanopillar arrays show enhanced stability under large strains (&#8764; 180%) by effective control, mediated through liquid bridges, of film cracking progress, combined with exceptional strain&#8208;responsive sensitivity of resistance change by the cracking mechanism, this strategy offers a fluid&#8208;mechanics&#8208;based approach for robust wearable devices and soft robotic systems operating under extreme mechanical deformation.








Abstract
Recent flexible electronics with conformal interfaces between devices and human bodies are prone to receive circuit failure caused by uncontrollable cracking during physiological movements. A structural engineering strategy is reported that utilizes capillary&#8208;stabilized liquid bridges to spontaneously mediate crack initiation, propagation, and coalescence for film reinforcement. Specifically, rigid nanowire array are decorated onto flexible polydimethylsiloxane substrates and the nanoscale gaps between the nanowires are filled with non&#8208;volatile ionic liquids to form well&#8208;regulated meniscus. Using metal films as a model, it is found that stretchability of an Au film deposited on this meniscus exceeds that of its flat counterpart (180 vs 30%). In&#8208;situ optical observations and fluid dynamics analyses show that liquid bridge forces mechanically hinder the propagating of crack fronts and simultaneously initiate new cracks in different locations, leading to dispersed small cracks at strains below 80%. This scattering of cracks prevents the concentrated propagation and merging of cracks into penetrating fractures, with effective electrical percolation of Au films even under a high strain of 160%, which contrasts sharply with the counterparts without liquids where penetrating cracks occur at a small strain of &#8776;10%. Results indicate fluid mechanics as a versatile approach to reprogram film cracking for high&#8208;performance electronics.

         <title>Unprecedented Superelasticity in Mo17O47/MoS2 Core&#8211;Shell Nanowires</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
[001]&#8208;oriented Mo17O47/MoS2 core&#8211;shell nanowires exhibit remarkable superelasticity. Three&#8208;point bending tests confirm Young's modulus (103 GPa) matching DFT predictions. In situ scanning electron microscopy bending reveals 35% recoverable strain, unprecedented in inorganic nanowires. First&#8208;principles calculations attribute this superelasticity to reversible transitions between chemical bonding and van der Waals interactions, showing potential for flexible electronics.








Abstract
Inorganic materials are usually known with high modulus and brittleness. Here the finding of a [001]&#8208;oriented Mo17O47 nanowires (NWs) material is reported with a thin MoS2 shell that exhibits superelastic deformability superior to the reported inorganic NWs. Three&#8208;point bending tests reveal that the elastic modulus of Mo17O47 crystals in the [001] direction is 103&#160;GPa, consistent with the density functional theory (DFT)&#8208;predicted results. Furthermore, in situ bending tests via scanning electron microscopy, accomplished with finite element simulations, demonstrate that the NWs can sustain bending strains up to 35% repeatedly without showing appreciable residual deformation. First&#8208;principles calculations reveal that this extraordinary superelasticity results from the smooth transformation between the chemical bonding and physical binding (van der Waals) in the [001] direction of Mo17O47 crystal. The remarkable superelasticity of Mo17O47 NWs may offer enormous potential in flexible electronics and photonic devices.

         <title>Toward Stable, High&#8208;Energy, Partially Disordered Mn&#8208;Rich Spinel Cathodes by Revealing and Mitigating Surface Degradation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechano&#8208;activated partially disordered spinel LiMn2O4 is demonstrated with high Mn utilization and a specific energy over 800 Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 at the cathode active material (CAM) level. Surface degradation, caused by the Jahn&#8208;Teller effect in baseline commercial carbonate electrolyte (Gen 2), intensifies Mn2+ dissolution and crosstalk at high potentials. Advanced electrolytes effectively mitigate these issues, thus minimizing Li&#8208;ion inventory loss.








Abstract
Mn&#8208;rich cathodes balance performance and sustainability but suffer from limited cyclability due to Mn dissolution and cathode&#8208;to&#8208;anode crosstalk. The Jahn&#8208;Teller (J&#8208;T) effect of Mn3+ is often linked to the above phenomena, such as in spinel LiMn2O4. However, in typical voltage ranges, significant Mn3+ only appears near the end of discharge, highlighting the need to reassess its role in driving Mn dissolution, structural degradation, and battery performance. Here, the spinel cathode's degree of disorder is tailored to expand the Mn redox range, enabling segmentation into J&#8208;T active and less active voltage ranges. Cycling at segmented voltage windows reveals surface degradation mechanisms with and without the major J&#8208;T effect. Despite a stronger J&#8208;T effect below 3.6 V vs. Li/Li+, Mn dissolution is less significant than above 3.6 V. Expanding the cycling window to 2.0&#8211;4.3 V causes severe degradation as the J&#8208;T active range induces a tetragonal phase and Mn2+&#8208;rich surface, driving Mn dissolution and consuming Li&#8208;ion inventory in full cells. Reducing electrolyte acidity minimizes Mn3+ disproportionation, enabling a stable dopant&#8208;free Mn&#8208;only cathode with a 250 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 specific capacity. These findings demonstrate that full cells using Mn&#8208;rich cathodes have the potential to avoid the notorious crosstalk problem through electrolyte engineering.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Nano&#8208;Islands: Unlocking New Horizons in Catalytic Activity and Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom nano&#8208;islands (SANIs) are innovative confined&#8208;space single&#8208;atom systems composed of single atoms, nano&#8208;islands, and support. Due to their confined space, multiple active sites, interfacial interactions, and tunable coordination structure, SANIs catalysts exhibit excellent electrocatalytic activity, stability, and selectivity. This review comprehensively analyzes recent advancements in SANIs catalysts, and the challenges and opportunities for their development in the field of heterogeneous catalysis, and accelerating their transformation to industrial applications are discussed.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), renowned for their maximized atomic utilization, tunable coordination environments, and unique electronic structures, are critical to energy conversion and storage. However, obstacles to their practical performance include atomic agglomeration (caused by high surface free energy) and active site passivation (due to overly strong metal&#8211;support chemical bonds). Single&#8208;atom nano&#8208;islands (SANIs) catalysts, characterized by confined spaces and innovative structural designs, have better electrocatalytic activity and stability. This review comprehensively analyzes recent advancements in SANIs catalysts, highlighting their contributions to catalytic activity, stability, structural optimization, and selectivity. We systematically summarize the design principles and strategies for SANIs electrocatalysts by focusing on material selection, metal&#8211;support interactions, and coordination structures. Finally, the challenges and opportunities associated with SANIs catalysts to promote their development in heterogeneous catalysis and accelerate their transition into industrial applications are discussed.

         <title>Increasing the Stability of Deep Blue Phosphor&#8208;Sensitized OLEDs Using the Polariton&#8208;Enhanced Purcell Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The polariton&#8208;enhanced Purcell (PEP) effect is demonstrated to enhance the stability of the deep blue phosphor&#8208;sensitized fluorescent (PSF) OLEDs by 3.1 X compared to PSF diodes lacking this effect.

Abstract
The stability of efficient, deep blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) remains a major challenge in the field of organic electronics. Poor device stability originates from the high probability for destructive non&#8208;radiative triplet exciton annihilation events. Phosphor&#8208;sensitized fluorescence (PSF) is proposed to achieve an efficient, deep blue color by energy transfer from phosphors to fluorophores. Recently, the polariton&#8208;enhanced Purcell (PEP) effect is introduced to decrease the triplet radiative lifetime and density, resulting in an increase in blue phosphorescent OLED lifetime. Here, the PEP effect is introduced to enhance the stability of the PSF&#8208;OLEDs. It is shown that the PEP effect increases all radiative decay rates of the phosphors and fluorophores, leading to a reduction in the triplet annihilation events. Using a Pt&#8208;complex phosphor sensitizer and a so&#8208;called multi&#8208;resonance fluorescent emitter in a PEP cavity, a 3.1&#8208;fold lifetime increase is observed at a current density of J = 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, reduced EQE roll&#8208;off and deep blue color with Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage coordinates of (0.13, 0.09). The PEP effect maximally extends PSF&#8208;OLED lifetimes in devices with the highest triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet energy transfer rates. Moreover, this work suggests that the benefits of PEPs apply to all triplet&#8208;based OLEDs.

&lt;p&gt;The polariton-enhanced Purcell (PEP) effect is demonstrated to enhance the stability of the deep blue phosphor-sensitized fluorescent (PSF) OLEDs by 3.1 X compared to PSF diodes lacking this effect. In addition, PSF-OLEDs exhibit reduced EQE roll-off and deep blue color emission. The PEP effect maximally extends PSF-OLED lifetimes in devices with the highest triplet-to-singlet energy transfer rates.

         <title>Evaluation and Rehabilitation System for Ulnar&#8208;Innervated Muscles Facilitated by Rare Earth Oxide&#8208;Enhanced Triboelectric Sensor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops a muscle atrophy evaluation and rehabilitation system utilizing rare earth oxide&#8208;enhanced triboelectric sensors integrated with a multi&#8208;channel signal collector and machine learning algorithms, enabling precise assessment of ulnar nerve injury recovery. The system demonstrates high sensitivity, accuracy, and visualization capability, offering significant advances in grip strength rehabilitation monitoring and biomedical sensing applications.








Abstract
Ulnar nerve injuries often lead to muscle atrophy and reduced hand function, necessitating precise monitoring and effective rehabilitation strategies. Current grip strength measurement tools rely on rigid mechanical equipment, which is inconvenient and requires frequent calibration. To address this, a muscle atrophy evaluation and rehabilitation system (MUERS) is presented, featuring a highly sensitive rare earth oxide&#8208;enhanced triboelectric sensor (RETS). Utilizing the unique electrochemical properties of rare earth oxides, RETS demonstrates a linear voltage&#8208;force response in the range of 8&#8211;80 kPa, with a maximum linear error of 1.5%. Integrated with a multi&#8208;channel STM32 signal collector, RETS enables real&#8208;time grip strength monitoring across all five fingers. Combining sensor output with an SVM algorithm, the system achieves 98.61% accuracy in identifying finger grip strength injuries and classifies damage into three levels with an average accuracy of 96.67%. MUERS evaluates rehabilitation progress by scoring grip strength and providing feedback to clinicians. Over a four&#8208;week cycle, it consistently captures improvements in muscle recovery, aiding individualized rehabilitation plans. This system offers fine&#8208;grained assessment capabilities for diagnosing and monitoring nerve injury&#8208;induced muscle atrophy, paving the way for advanced biomedical sensing and personalized rehabilitation.

         <title>Microscopic&#8208;Level Anion &amp; Diluent Chemistry in Electrolyte for Aqueous Supercapacitors Operating at High Voltage and Low Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microscopic&#8208;level anion &amp; diluent chemistry strategy is proposed to develop an advanced Ca(ClO4)2/H2O&#8208;acetonitrile (AN) electrolyte that can operate at high voltage and low temperature. The weak interaction of H2O with ClO4&#8722; guarantees strong intramolecular O&#9472;H bonds and resulting electrolyte stability. The AN serves as a solvation diluent capable of weakening electrostatic Ca2+&#8208;ClO4&#8722; attraction, preventing salt precipitation, and finally yielding a high&#8208;performance supercapacitor.








Abstract
Aqueous supercapacitors, serving as safe and green high&#8208;power energy storage devices, hold significant potential in various applications. Exploring advanced electrolytes beyond traditional electrolytes is essential for achieving stable high&#8208;voltage and low&#8208;temperature operations. Herein, a hybrid electrolyte with a high electrochemical stability window (3.29&#160;V) and sufficient ionic conductivity (1.5 mS cm&#8722;1 at &#8722;50&#160;&#176;C) is developed via hybridizing 8 m Ca(ClO4)2/H2O with acetonitrile (AN) diluent. The charged Ca2+ cations anchor the oxygen atoms in H2O molecules, preventing them from being hydrogen acceptors. Meanwhile, the ClO4&#8722; anions weakly interact with hydrogen atoms, which ensures strong intramolecular O&#9472;H bonds in 8 m Ca(ClO4)2/H2O. The used AN can contribute to decreased salt dosage, without any compromise to electrochemical stability and safety. Furthermore, the AN with a higher donor number than ClO4&#8722; can replace the ClO4&#8722; in Ca2+ solvation sheaths, which reduces Ca2+&#8722;ClO4&#8722; clusters, accordingly suppressing salt precipitation even at &#8722;50&#160;&#176;C. Resultantly, a symmetric supercapacitor assembled with 4.2 m Ca(ClO4)2/H2O&#8208;AN electrolyte presents high&#8208;voltage and temperature&#8208;adaptability features, with excellent rate capability and high long&#8208;term cycling stability from 25 to &#8722;50&#160;&#176;C at 2.3&#160;V.

         <title>An Ultrathin Membrane with Bubble&#8208;Raft&#8208;Inspired Single&#8208;Layer Nanofibrous Networks for Efficient and Low&#8208;Resistance Air Filtration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bubble&#8208;raft&#8208;inspired nanofibrous network membrane for efficient and low&#8208;resistance air filtration is fabricated via electrospinning and phase separation. Benefiting from the single&#8208;layer polysulfone nanofibrous network (&#8776;40 nm fiber diameter), the obtained membrane exhibits integrated structural features of small pore size, high porosity, and ultrathin thickness, which endows it with high filtration efficiency, low pressure drop, and high transparency.








Abstract
Airborne particulate matter (PM) is a major global safety concern, significantly straining the ecological environment, human health, and economy. Filtration membranes, essential for PM removal, are challenging in achieving both high efficiency and low air resistance, resulting in a high pressure drop during efficient filtration. Herein, inspired by bubble rafts, an ultrathinnanofibrous network membrane is fabricated by transforming a liquid film of polysulfonesolution on electrospun fibrous scaffold into a single&#8208;layer network via nonsolvent&#8208;induced phase separation. Tailoring of the polysulfone concentration in the liquid film supported by the scaffold and of the phase separation process induced by flowing nonsolvent allows the construction of the single&#8208;layer network with interconnected nanofibers (diameter of &#8776;40&#160;nm). Benefiting from the single&#8208;layer network, the membrane exhibits a small pore size (&#8776;270&#160;nm) at a high porosity of 90.3% and ultrathin thickness of &#8776;800&#160;nm. Consequently, the membrane shows high efficiency (99.8% removal of PM0.3) at an ultralow pressure drop (&lt;40&#160;Pa). Moreover, the membrane exhibits high transparency (&gt;83%) and allows the light breeze (wind speed of 3.2 m s&#8722;1) to pass through easily, enabling energy&#8208;efficient applications, such as window screens. This work provides new insights into designing membranes for efficient and low&#8208;resistance filtration and separation.

         <title>Reward Driven Workflows for Unsupervised Explainable Analysis of Phases and Ferroic Variants From Atomically Resolved Imaging Data</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reward&#8208;driven workflows enable fully unsupervised segmentation of atomically resolved STEM images, revealing phases and ferroic variants without any labels. By encoding domain&#8208;wall straightness and length as explicit rewards, the method automatically tunes clustering and variational&#8208;autoencoder hyperparameters. This physics&#8208;guided optimization yields robust, real&#8208;time mappings of polarization and structural domains for next&#8208;generation autonomous microscopy.








Abstract
Rapid progress in aberration corrected electron microscopy necessitates development of robust methods for the identification of phases, ferroic variants, and other pertinent aspects of materials structure from imaging data. While unsupervised methods for clustering and classification are widely used for these tasks, their performance can be sensitive to hyperparameter selection in the analysis workflow. In this study, the effects of descriptors and hyperparameters are explored on the capability of unsupervised ML methods to distill local structural information, exemplified by the discovery of polarization and lattice distortion in Sm &#8722; dopped&#8197;BiFeO3 (BFO) thin films. It is demonstrated that a reward&#8208;driven approach can be used to optimize these key hyperparameters across the full workflow, where rewards are designed to reflect domain wall continuity and straightness, ensuring that the analysis aligns with the material's physical behavior. This approach allows the discovery of local descriptors that are best aligned with the specific physical behavior, providing insight into the fundamental physics of materials. The reward driven workflow is further extended to disentangle structural factors of variation via an optimized variational autoencoder (VAE). Finally, the importance of well&#8208;defined rewards is explored as a quantifiable measure of the success of the workflow.

     alt="Reward Driven Workflows for Unsupervised Explainable Analysis of Phases and Ferroic Variants From Atomically Resolved Imaging Data"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reward-driven workflows enable fully unsupervised segmentation of atomically resolved STEM images, revealing phases and ferroic variants without any labels. By encoding domain-wall straightness and length as explicit rewards, the method automatically tunes clustering and variational-autoencoder hyperparameters. This physics-guided optimization yields robust, real-time mappings of polarization and structural domains for next-generation autonomous microscopy.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rapid progress in aberration corrected electron microscopy necessitates development of robust methods for the identification of phases, ferroic variants, and other pertinent aspects of materials structure from imaging data. While unsupervised methods for clustering and classification are widely used for these tasks, their performance can be sensitive to hyperparameter selection in the analysis workflow. In this study, the effects of descriptors and hyperparameters are explored on the capability of unsupervised ML methods to distill local structural information, exemplified by the discovery of polarization and lattice distortion in &lt;i&gt;Sm&lt;/i&gt; &#8722; &lt;i&gt;dopped&lt;/i&gt;&#8197;&lt;i&gt;BiFeO&lt;/i&gt;

It is demonstrated that a reward-driven approach can be used to optimize these key hyperparameters across the full workflow, where rewards are designed to reflect domain wall continuity and straightness, ensuring that the analysis aligns with the material's physical behavior. This approach allows the discovery of local descriptors that are best aligned with the specific physical behavior, providing insight into the fundamental physics of materials.

         <title>Artesunate Nanoplatform Targets the Serine&#8211;MAPK Axis in Cancer&#8208;Associated Fibroblasts to Reverse Photothermal Resistance in Triple&#8208;Negative Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The artesunate nanoplatform selectively targets ECM CAF, functioning as a GTPase inhibitor through disruption of intracellular serine homeostasis. This metabolic intervention effectively suppresses MAPK cascade activity, which consequently inhibits PTT&#8208;induced CAF to ECM CAF differentiation. By attenuating this phenotypic transition, the nanoplatform significantly reduces the formation of TRB structure, ultimately enhancing tumor sensitivity to PTT.








Abstract
Cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play a pivotal role in inducing photothermal therapy (PTT) resistance of triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC), but with unclear mechanism. Herein, aminoethyl anisamide&#8208;modified nano&#8208;biomimetic low&#8208;density lipoprotein (A&#8208;aLDL) is used to target deliver the PTT agent and artesunate (ARS) to both CAFs and cancer cells. Though CAFs are sensitive to PTT and notably transition to heat&#8208;resistant phenotype, the formed protective barrier is destroyed by ARS. Subsequently, the outstanding anti&#8208;tumor effects are achieved through PTT in multiple models with such kind of combination therapy. Interestingly, the mechanism is discovered that serine metabolism plays a major role in CAF resistance through spatially omics. ARS disrupts serine homeostasis, thereby attenuating the cascade activity of GTPases in MAPK pathway. Meanwhile, MAP2K7 is the most potential target for sensitizing PTT. By integrating ARS with PTT agents, the serine&#8208;MAPK axis in CAFs is successfully modulated, thereby overcoming PTT resistance in TNBC therapy.

         <title>Spin Engineering of Dual&#8208;Atom Site Catalysts for Efficient Electrochemical Energy Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent progress in spin engineering of dual&#8208;atom site catalysts (DASCs), emphasizing how spin&#8208;related properties enhance electrocatalytic activity, selectivity, and stability. It summarizes cutting&#8208;edge developments in dual&#8208;atom catalysis, discusses the underlying spin&#8208;catalysis mechanisms and structure&#8211;performance relationships, and proposes high&#8208;throughput screening strategies to guide the rational design of spin&#8208;optimized DASCs for small&#8208;molecule conversion reactions.








Abstract
Dual&#8208;atom site catalysts (DASCs) provide more advantages than single&#8208;atom systems in improving energy conversions, owing to their unique features. For example, the coupling effect may align the spin of two adjacent dual&#8208;atom active centers in parallel or antiparallel via electron exchange interactions, thereby altering reaction mechanisms and overall efficiency. While numerous reviews have explored spin&#8208;dependent electrocatalysis, there remains a lack of a comprehensive, spin&#8208;focused framework for understanding the catalytic behavior of DASCs. This review emphasizes the role of spin in dual&#8208;atom site centers for electrocatalysis research. First, spin fundamentals in electrocatalysts, including spin&#8208;selective orbital occupation, spin ordering, and spin coupling, are comprehensively summarized to provide a solid foundation for subsequent discussions. Then, spin engineering strategies of DASCs are reviewed, including manipulating the spin configuration of the central atoms, modulating coordination environments, and tuning metal&#8211;support interactions. Next, recent developments in spin engineering of DASCs are reviewed, with a focus on structure&#8211;performance relationships. Furthermore, high&#8208;throughput screening techniques integrated with machine learning are discussed for developing highly efficient DASCs based on spin engineering. The challenges and opportunities of DASCs and spin engineering are thoroughly discussed to promote the advancement of new energy applications.

         <title>Active Fabric Origami Enabled by Digital Embroidery of Magnetic Yarns</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates a scalable textile manufacturing process that fabricates active origami fabrics (AFO) via digital embroidery of magnetic yarns. The programmable AFO exhibits reversible 2D and 3D transformations under magnetic fields, enabling functionalities such as altering surface roughness and linear actuation. These reversible deformation fabrics show promising potential for diverse applications in smart textiles and wearable devices.








Abstract
Active fabrics can perform deformations such as contraction, expansion, and bending when exposed to external stimuli. Origami, the ancient art of paper folding, transforms a 2D sheet into a complex 3D structure. However, integrating origami&#8208;inspired designs into active fabrics presents significant challenges, including the large&#8208;scale production of stimuli&#8208;responsive yarns that can be processed using standard textile techniques to achieve intricate origami patterns with high precision and versatility. In this work, the large&#8208;scale fabrication of magnetic yarns featuring high magnetic susceptibility, mechanical strength, and flexibility is reported, which is enabled by processing magnetic polymer composites with a series of textile engineering processes. Utilizing digital embroidery, these magnetic yarns are programmed into origami patterns with predefined yarn alignments on flexible fabrics to create various active fabric origami structures that are mechanical durable and functional consistent. These structures can reversibly transform among shapes in response to specific magnetic fields, enabling a range of functionalities such as altering surface roughness, delivering linear actuation, mimicking flower blooming, and providing switchable thermal insulation. The novel active fabric origami provides promising smart platforms across areas as diverse as smart textiles, soft robotics, wearable devices, and fashion.

         <title>Bioinspired Design of Heterogenous Single&#8208;Atomic&#8208;Site Catalysts for Electrocatalysis and Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review gives a summary on the representative bioinspired single&#8208;atomic&#8208;site catalysts (SACs) and their applications in heterogeneous electrocatalysis and photocatalysis. The fundamentals of bioinspired design strategies are systematically discussed in the context of the first shell coordination, the second/long&#8208;range coordination, and the outer microenvironment. The applications of SACs in electrocatalysis and photocatalysis as inspired by natural enzymes are discussed.








Abstract
The emergence of single&#8208;atomic&#8208;site catalysts (SACs) provides a specific model to bridge the gap between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. An interesting aspect in SACs is how to apply the bioinspired strategies in homogeneous biocatalysis to the design of heterogeneous SACs. The effectiveness of this approach relies on systematic insights in structural characteristics and catalytic mechanisms of both the biocatalysts and the heterogeneous SACs. This review will give a summary on the representative bioinspired single&#8208;atomic&#8208;site catalysts and their applications in heterogeneous electrocatalysis and photocatalysis. The fundamentals of bioinspired design strategies will be systematically discussed in the first shell coordination (quasi&#8208;homogeneous metal centers and coordination numbers/species) and the second/long&#8208;range coordination (heteroatoms doping, dual&#8208;metallic sites, nano&#8208;single&#8208;atom&#8208;site, and metal&#8208;support interaction). Also, the unique non&#8208;covalent interactions and oriented mass/proton/electron transfer channels in heterogenous SACs are highlighted as inspired by the outer microenvironment of biological systems. The practical electrocatalytic and photocatalytic applications of bioinspired SACs are further discussed by drawing inspiration from hydrogenase, nitrogenase, oxidase, and dehydrogenase to produce hydrogen&#8208;, carbon&#8208;, nitrogen&#8208;, and oxygen&#8208;based value&#8208;added chemicals. The current challenges and future opportunities for the development of bioinspired heterogenous SACs will also be discussed.

By rationally designing &#960;&#8722;conjugated anthraquinone&#8722;based redox&#8722;active ligands (DHAQ/DAAQ), a series of layered, flower&#8211;like MnMOC structures are synthesized. Comprehensive characterization techniques are employed to systematically investigate the reaction mechanisms of these MnMOCs in AZIBs. Importantly, a machine learning&#8722;based model is developed to predict specific capacity.

Aqueous zinc&#8211;ion batteries (AZIBs) have garnered significant attention owing to their high safety and low cost; however, their development is hindered by the poor cycling stability and low capacity of traditional inorganic cathode materials. This study innovatively utilizes dihydroxy/diamino anthraquinone (DHAQ/DAAQ) ligands featuring &#960;&#8211;conjugated systems and quinone&#8211;based redox activity. By precisely regulating the substitution sites (1,2&#8211;/1,4&#8211;/1,5&#8211;) and coordinating them with Mn2+, layered flower&#8722;cluster Manganese&#8211;based metal&#8211;organic coordination is successfully constructed. The experimental results indicated that in the Mn&#8722;1,4&#8722;DHAQ cathode, the symmetric structure of the 1,4&#8211;dihydroxy substitution promoted electron delocalization and formed stable coordination bonds with Mn2+, thereby providing excellent electrochemical performance. Furthermore, both in situ and ex situ characterizations elucidated the Zn2+ storage mechanism during charge&#8211;discharge processes. Notably, this work incorporated machine learning techniques to develop a specific capacity prediction model, laying a methodological foundation for future research in the field of energy storage. Theoretical calculations are employed to gain deeper insight into the underlying reasons for the outstanding performance of Mn&#8722;1,4&#8722;DHAQ. In addition, Mn&#8722;1,4&#8722;DHAQ is successfully applied as a cathode material in soft&#8722;pack batteries, gel electrolyte devices, and screen&#8722;printed devices, demonstrating excellent mechanical adaptability and practical application potential. Novel strategy for high&#8722;performance MOC&#8211;based AZIBs boosts practical energy storage applications.

&lt;p&gt;By rationally designing &#960;&#8722;conjugated anthraquinone&#8722;based redox&#8722;active ligands (DHAQ/DAAQ), a series of layered, flower&#8211;like MnMOC structures are synthesized. Comprehensive characterization techniques are employed to systematically investigate the reaction mechanisms of these MnMOCs in AZIBs. Importantly, a machine learning&#8722;based model is developed to predict specific capacity. Notably, the MnMOCs demonstrates excellent performance in practical applications, offering strong support for the advancement of MOC materials in the field of energy storage.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing net charges of NPs in nonpolar solvent, dielectrophoretic attraction and Coulombic modulation are combined to achieve distinct particle densities at oppositely charged surfaces. This selective assembly enables efficient submicron&#8208;scale separation of NP mixtures and forms complex binary NP patterns in one step, offering a powerful and direct route for assembling and integrating multiple NPs into advanced multifunctional nanodevices.








Abstract
Precise nanofabrication of diverse nanoparticles (NPs) with high spatial resolution is crucial for developing advanced nanodevices. While various bottom&#8208;up approaches have been developed, limitations such as complex overlay steps, contamination risks, and low spatial resolution still exist. Here, an approach is presented for sub&#8208;micron spatial resolution nanopatterning of binary NPs. By utilizing net charges of NPs dispersed in nonpolar solvent, dielectrophoretic attraction and sign&#8208;dependent Coulombic modulation are combined to achieve distinct particle densities at oppositely charged surfaces. This selective assembly enables efficient separation of NP mixtures at submicron scales, facilitating the formation of complex binary NP patterns in a single step. The technique offers a powerful and direct route for assembling and integrating multiple NPs, providing a new way for advanced multifunctional nanodevices.

         <title>Nanosecond Laser Synthesis of MXene&#8208;Derived TiO2/High&#8208;Entropy Alloys for Photo&#8208;Assisted Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;entropy photoelectrocatalyst is rapidly synthesized by pulsed laser heating MXene nanosheets loading metal ions. The MXene derived&#8208;TiO2 and high&#8208;entropy alloy heterojunction can effectively enhance the oxygen evolution reaction kinetics with solar energy assistance, reducing the charging potential of zinc&#8211;air batteries and improving the charge&#8211;discharge efficiency.









Abstract
Photo&#8208;assisted zinc&#8211;air batteries have garnered significant attention for applying solar energy to decrease the charge voltage and improve energy efficiency. However, the uniform and rapid synthesis of highly active, stable, and low&#8208;cost photoelectrocatalysts for zinc&#8211;air batteries remains a significant challenge. Herein, a pulsed laser method is reported for the rapid preparation of MXene&#8208;derived TiO2/high&#8208;entropy alloy heterojunctions (M&#8208;TiO2/HEAs) as photoelectrocatalysts. Benefiting from the exceptional photo&#8208;thermal conversion capability of MXene, the local temperature reaches up to 2800&#160;K under laser irradiation, along with ultra&#8208;fast heating and cooling rates (&#8776;106&#160;K&#160;s&#8722;1), enabling the successful synthesis of M&#8208;TiO2/HEAs. Zinc&#8211;air batteries incorporating&#160;M&#8208;TiO2/HEAs exhibit a low charge voltage of 1.87&#160;V at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 under light irradiation. In addition, it exhibits exceptional cycle stability, maintaining stable cycling for 1000&#160;h at a current density of 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that M&#8208;TiO2/HEAs heterojunctions exhibit strong electronic interactions. These interactions effectively promote the separation of photogenerated charge carriers and the conversion of electrochemical intermediates, thereby enhancing oxygen evolution reaction activity under light irradiation. This work offers valuable insights into the rapid fabrication of photoelectrocatalysts, providing new perspectives for developing light&#8208;enhanced energy storage systems.

         <title>Breaking Apoptosis&#8208;Induced Immune Silence: Ultrasound&#8208;Activated Nano&#8208;Oncolytic Therapy Reinvigorates Antitumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrasound (US)&#8211;activated nano&#8208;oncolytic system, cRGD&#8208;Lip@PFP is introduced, which induces necroptosis&#8208;like oncolytic cell death. This method triggers the explosive release of DAMPs and activates the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, resulting in a more potent antitumor immune response than conventional apoptosis&#8208;based therapies. This innovative strategy markedly enhances tumor immunogenicity and remodels immunosuppression to effectively improve the efficacy of immunotherapy.








Abstract
Conventional tumor therapies typically depend on the apoptotic pathway, which often leads to inadequate immunogenicity. This limitation underscores the urgent need for innovative treatments that enhance immunogenicity. In this study, an ultrasound (US)&#8208;activated nano&#8208;oncolytic system (designated as cRGD&#8208;Lip@PFP), is presented and consists of nanoliposomes (Lip) modified with the cRGD peptide for targeted tumor delivery. This system features a perfluoropentane (PFP) core that undergoes US&#8208;triggered acoustomechanical effects, enabling controlled expansion from nanoscale to microscale, ultimately leading to rupture and the generation of cavitation effects. Intracellular cavitation further induces necroptosis&#8208;like oncolytic cell death. The efficacy of various treatments in stimulating immune responses is systematically compared and it is demonstrated that the nano&#8208;oncolytic system effectively enhances the release of damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Additionally, the release of DNA fragments activates the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, resulting in an amplified immune response. Furthermore, this nano&#8208;oncolytic system alleviates the hypoxic tumor microenvironment and counteracts immunosuppression. Compared to traditional apoptosis, the necroptosis&#8208;like oncolytic cell death induced by this strategy exhibits enhanced immunogenicity. This approach presents an innovative paradigm for tumor immunotherapy based on acoustomechanical effects, offering a promising alternative to tackle the issue of insufficient immunogenicity often associated with conventional apoptosis therapies.

         <title>Crystallinity&#8208;Induced Ion Rectification in Polymer/Zn Interphases for Stable Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work designs a macromolecular ordering&#8208;tuned interphase by leveraging the phase&#8208;separated hierarchical ion tunnels in semicrystalline polymers to address Zn/electrolyte interfacial issues. The PVA interphase, with lamellar orientation parallel to the Zn anode, achieves a balance between electrode protection and ionic conductivity, enabling rapid yet uniform Zn2+ transport and interfacial stability.








Abstract
The energy density and cycle life of aqueous zinc metal batteries are hindered by inherent chemical and mechanical instabilities at the Zn/electrolyte interface, causing uncontrolled dendrite formation and side reactions. Here, an anisotropic crystalline polymer interphase by leveraging the hierarchical structure to stabilize the interface is designed. The stabilization effect strongly depends on the crystallinity of polymer chains, where the one with optimal ion transfer possesses a preferred orientation of nanocrystals parallel to the Zn anode. This topological structure creates fast tunnel for ion transport that significantly enhances the kinetics and reversibility of electrochemical transformations. The ordered crystalline phase and disordered amorphous phase respectively blocks H&#8322;O penetration and provides Zn2&#8314; transport channels, reaching an optimum between electrode protection and ion transfer. Symmetric cells with the crystallinity&#8208;tuned interface demonstrate an exceptionally long lifespan exceeding 3000&#160;h at elevated current density and capacity of 5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and 5&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2, with a cumulative plated capacity of 7500&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2. The Zn/AC hybrid ion supercapacitor exhibits outstanding stability, enduring over 10&#160;000 cycles at 5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. The work unveils new ordering&#8208;dependent ion transport in solid&#8208;state polymer interphase/electrolyte and provides a feasible approach for advancing grid&#8208;scale aqueous batteries.

The stabilization effect strongly depends on the crystallinity of polymer chains, where the one with optimal ion transfer possesses a preferred orientation of nanocrystals parallel to the Zn anode. This topological structure creates fast tunnel for ion transport that significantly enhances the kinetics and reversibility of electrochemical transformations. The ordered crystalline phase and disordered amorphous phase respectively blocks H&#8322;O penetration and provides Zn&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8314; transport channels, reaching an optimum between electrode protection and ion transfer. Symmetric cells with the crystallinity-tuned interface demonstrate an exceptionally long lifespan exceeding 3000&#160;h at elevated current density and capacity of 5&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 5&#160;mAh&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, with a cumulative plated capacity of 7500&#160;mAh&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The Zn/AC hybrid ion supercapacitor exhibits outstanding stability, enduring over 10&#160;000 cycles at 5&#160;A&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The work unveils new ordering-dependent ion transport in solid-state polymer interphase/electrolyte and provides a feasible approach for advancing grid-scale aqueous batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Efficient Cooling via Synergistic Electro&#8208;Thermal Phase Changes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Featuring low energy consumption and easy integration with modern electronic, electrocaloric polymer is a highly promising alternative to vapor&#8208;compression systems. Here, the synergistic electro&#8208;thermal phase change methodology boosted the performance of electrocaloric materials, achieving a dramatic temperature drop in simulated electronic chip cooling. This methodology opened up a new way for enhancing the entropy change of electrocaloric materials.








Abstract
Electro&#8208;phase change materials (electro&#8208;PCM), based on the electrocaloric effect, have attracted significant attention and achieved rapid development in the field of cooling technology owing to their environmental protection, low energy consumption, and miniaturization. However, due to their limited isothermal entropy change and thermal conductivity, the cooling capacity of the electro&#8208;PCM devices has severely limited their cooling effect on electronic devices. Here, with the synergistic electro&#8208;thermal phase changes, the entropy change and thermal conductivity of electro&#8208;PCM are significantly improved by stacking it with thermo&#8208;phase change materials (thermo&#8208;PCM). Compared with that of the electro&#8208;PCM, the entropy change and thermal conductivity of electro&#8208;thermal phase change materials (ETPCM) stack can be up to 4.68&#8208;fold (from 28.31 to 132.35 J kg&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 at electric field of 100 MV m&#8722;1) and 2.39&#8208;fold (from 0.18 to 0.43&#160;W m&#8722;1&#183;K&#8722;1), respectively. The practicality of this strategy has also been fully validated by cooling a simulated electronic chip (1.75&#160;W cm&#8722;2) with a temperature drop of 49.32 K after constructing ETPCM stack&#8208;based cooling device using the electrostatic actuation prototype. The synergistic enhancement of entropy change and thermal conductivity paves the way for the future direction of electrocaloric cooling toward interdisciplinary fusion.

         <title>3D&#8208;Architectured Acceptor with High Photoluminescence Quantum Yield and Moderate Crystallinity for High&#8208;efficiency Organic Solar Cells with Low Voltage Loss</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strategic embedding of 3D norbornene units in fused&#8208;ring acceptors suppresses excessive aggregation, synergistically boosting photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and achieving a record&#8208;breaking power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.4% and an extremely low voltage loss (Vloss) of 0.548 V in organic solar cells.








Abstract
This study outlines a molecular design approach that entails integrating 3D structural motifs into the central core or terminal groups of fused&#8208;ring acceptor molecules, specifically, LLZ1, LLZ2, and LLZ3&#8211;by incorporating a 3D architecture unit of norbornene. The objective is to modulate the aggregation behavior of these molecules by modifying their molecular structure, thereby enhancing the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) values of the acceptor materials and reducing the non&#8208;radiative recombination voltage loss in the corresponding devices. Our research findings demonstrate that the introduction of norbornene units effectively suppresses excessive molecular aggregation and significantly improves the PLQY values of the acceptor molecules. Further research has demonstrated that only the acceptor molecule LLZ1, characterized by both high PLQY and moderate crystallinity, can strike an optimal balance between the dual requirements of reducing voltage loss and enhancing charge transport in the device. Utilizing the preferred molecule LLZ1, we achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.0% in binary system and 20.4% in ternary device with much&#8208;reduced voltage loss of 0.508V, which is among the highest values of current OSCs. In summary, this work provides novel insights and research directions for the development of OSCs with low voltage loss and high PCE.

         <title>Anisotropically Thermal&#8208;Protective Porous Ceramics Enabled by Nacre&#8208;Like Framework</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Relying on the porous nacre&#8208;like framework, large&#8208;scale thermal&#8208;protective ceramic is produced via a simple bottom&#8208;up film&#8208;to&#8208;bulk assembly strategy. This porous ceramic achieves the combination of mechanical and anisotropic thermal properties, making it good candidate for complex thermal protection applications.








Abstract
Ever more severe energy dilemma and unfulfilled demands for thermal protection applications have drawn a great interest in developing thermal protective materials. Though great progress is achieved by implementing several advanced micro&#8208;architectures, the conflict between thermal insulation and mechanical properties, along with the complex manufacturing process, remains the main obstacles for fabricating ideal integrated thermal insulation materials. Here, a scalable nacre&#8208;like porous ceramic is reported with a good combination of thermal insulation and mechanical strength (&#8776;0.058&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1, 22&#160;MPa) via a bottom&#8208;up film&#8208;to&#8208;bulk assembly. The well&#8208;aligned microplatelets constructed the nacre&#8208;like framework and produced porosity in between for thermal insulation while the mineral bridges between microplatelets connected and strengthened the whole framework. Besides, the structure&#8208;induced anisotropy of thermal conductivity on out&#8208;plane and in&#8208;plane directions provides the possibilities for heat management. Moreover, this material shows an excellent fire&#8208;resistance and maintained performance after fire. These structure&#8208;induced integrated superiorities made this material good candidate for complex thermal protection applications.

         <title>Anchoring Nickel and Stabilizing Oxygen in Coherent LiNiO2@LiFePO4 Composite Cathode Materials for Rechargeable Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The LiNiO2@LiFePO4 composite material with coherent combination exhibits remarkable cyclability, rate capability and high first&#8208;cycle Coulombic efficiency. The coherent oriented channels favor the reversible and rapid lithium&#8208;ion transport with suppressed strain accumulation while phosphate anions anchored on the LiNiO2 surface stabilizes Ni sites, mitigating surface degradation.








Abstract
LiNiO2 is an appealing cathode material for Li&#8208;ion batteries because of high energy density and low cost but suffers from irreversible phase transition and surface instability. Herein, a ball&#8208;milled LiNiO2@LiFePO4 composite with oriented coherent combination is reported with enhanced structural stability and Li+ diffusion. The coherent oriented channels are demonstrated to favor the reversible and rapid Li+ intercalation during the H2&#8208;H3 phase transition, which significantly alleviates structural strain accumulation. The covalent P&#9472;O bonds anchored on the LiNiO2 surface stabilizes the Ni sites, mitigating surface reconstruction and lattice oxygen loss. The LiNiO2@LiFePO4 cathode exhibits a specific capacity of 210 mAh g&#8722;1 and an initial Coulombic efficiency of 93.7% at 0.1 C, along with a remarkable rate capability of 156 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10 C. Furthermore, the full cells pairing LiNiO2@LiFePO4 cathode and graphite anode deliver a considerable energy density over 280 Wh kg&#8722;1 and a remarkable capacity retention. This study offers an effective approach of phosphate coalesce to upgrade high&#8208;capacity nickel&#8208;rich oxide cathode materials.

By exploiting the layered nature of GeSe, the carrier transport direction is effectively restrict, resulting in giant spin lifetimes. This leads to efficient spin injection at room temperature and gate tunable spin transport at low temperatures. Additionally, the results suggest that GeSe is the only air&#8208;stable 2D semiconductor suitable for spin transport channels at room temperature.








Abstract
The 2D materials are promising channel materials for spin transistors due to their natural spatial&#8208;confined carrier transport character. Nonetheless, electrical spin injection and detection in 2D semiconductors used to be challenging. This study reports high&#8208;efficient spin injection and transport in 2D GeSe, which exhibits moderate spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) and extended spin diffusion lengths due to the van der Waals structure. The non&#8208;local magnetoresistance (MR) measurements show a maximum spin polarization of 18.31%, a long spin diffusion length of 255.98&#160;nm, and a giant spin relaxation time of 17.6&#160;ns at room&#8208;temperature. After cooling to 4.3 K, the elevated spin diffusion length further increases to 397.04&#160;nm, with an elevated spin polarization of 25.38%, leading to the successful observation of local MR in a two&#8208;terminal lateral spin valve. Additionally, the spin transport characteristics are also tunable by gate voltages due to the field&#8208;dependent SOC and Rashba spin relaxation. This study highlights GeSe as an air&#8208;stable 2D semiconductor with anisotropic and gate&#8208;tunable spin transport capability. The results will remove the barriers to developing novel spintronic devices based on emerging 2D semiconductors.

         <title>Hair&#8208;Like Mechanoluminescent Structures with Ultralow Activation Threshold for Dynamic Force Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanoluminescence microcilia array film with a bionic hair&#8208;like structure achieves an ultralow activation threshold of just 10&#160;mN&#8212;the lowest reported to date&#8212;enabled by stress concentration. With excellent sensitivity to dynamic mechanical stimuli, mechanoluminescence&#8208;derived texture discrimination and Braille recognition with high accuracy is demonstrated for the first time via integration with an image&#8208;based machine learning approach.








Abstract
Mechanoluminescence (ML)&#8208;based sensing technology opens up new opportunities for photonic/electronic skin due to their self&#8208;powered nature, visible spatial mapping of mechanical stimuli, and intrinsic responses to dynamic forces. However, challenges such as weak brightness and high activation threshold have hindered their development. Inspired by hair&#8208;like structures of human skin, skin&#8208;bionic mechanoluminescent PDMS/ZnS:Cu microcilia array film (MLMCA) is fabricated using a magnetic field&#8208;assisted template method. The MLMCA exhibits tunable aspect ratios and ML intensity, with the underlying relationship between microcilia structure and ML performance clarified through finite element analysis. The MLMCA achieves an ultralow activation threshold at the micronewton level (&#8776;10 mN) owing to the stress concentration induced by high aspect ratio. With excellent sensitivity to dynamic mechanical stimuli, the MLMCA enables texture recognition with an accuracy of 99.95% when integrated with the image machine learning approach. Furthermore, an ML&#8208;based Braille&#8208;to&#8208;speech translation system is developed and achieved a high recognition accuracy of 96.74%. This study not only tackles the persistent limitation of high activation thresholds in ML&#8208;based sensing but also pioneers the practical use of ML&#8208;based tactile sensing in texture discrimination and Braille reading.

         <title>Time&#8208;Frequency Domain NO2&#8208;Humidity Sensor with Full&#8208;Range Tolerance Based on Pt Single&#8208;Atom Sensitized Nb2CTx Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a dual&#8208;mode NO2&#8208;humidity sensing platform based on Pt single&#8208;atom sensitized Nb2CTx nanosheets, enabling simultaneous high&#8208;performance time&#8208;domain NO2 and frequency&#8208;domain humidity sensing. Through elucidation of the resistance&#8208;capacitance orthogonal sensing mechanism and integration of PCB circuits with machine learning, the platform implements humidity localization, humidity&#8208;corrected NO2 alarms, and asthma pre&#8208;warning.









Abstract
Real&#8208;time in situ detection of NO2 is crucial for ensuring industrial safety and healthcare. However, conventional gas sensors face challenges from environmental humidity interference, limiting their reliability in practical applications. This study presents a dual&#8208;mode, full&#8208;range NO2&#8208;humidity sensing platform based on Pt single&#8208;atom&#8208;sensitized Nb2CTx nanosheets (Pt SA&#8208;Nb2CTx) integrated with TPU fiber mats (Pt SA&#8208;Nb2CTx@TPU). Combining resistive gas sensing and capacitive humidity sensing within a single device, this platform enables simultaneous NO2 and humidity detection with full&#8208;range humidity tolerance. The uniformly dispersed Pt single&#8208;atoms on the Nb2CTx nanosheets catalyze oxygen molecule dissociation and provide additional surface&#8208;active adsorption sites, achieving a 9.1&#8208;fold improvement in resistance response to 5&#160;ppm NO2 and a 25.7&#8208;fold increase in capacitance response at 95% relative humidity. Importantly, the unaffected capacitive response allows precise calibration of NO2 concentration using resistance and capacitance, ensuring accurate NO2 detection across diverse and fluctuating humidity. Leveraging time&#8208; and frequency&#8208;domain NO2&#8208;humidity sensing capability, the Pt SA&#8208;Nb2CTx@TPU sensor is successfully integrated into self&#8208;designed functional modules to realize humidity tracking, industrial NO2 concentration alarming in full&#8208;humidity range as well as asthma prevention and alarm applications. This study offers a novel solution for humidity&#8208;compensated NO2 detection, advancing the applicability of gas sensors in complex and dynamic environments.

         <title>Thermionics in Topological Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermionics is one of the fundamental energy conversion mechanisms in solid state systems. Recent development in topological materials opens new avenues in developing thermionic systems and devices. Due to the linear energy dispersion and topological protection of charge transport, these new materials are promising candidates for high efficiency thermionic energy generation, cooling and other applications.









Abstract
Thermionic emission is fundamental to many technologies and devices, including thermionic energy converters, X&#8208;ray tubes, scanning electron microscopes, and transmission electron microscopes. The discovery of topological materials, particularly graphene, has significantly advanced thermionics research. Thermionic emission in these materials deviates from the Richardson&#8208;Dushman equation due to their linear energy dispersion. Various models are developed to accurately describe thermionic emission. Graphene, with its dangling bond&#8208;free surface, can be stacked either vertically or laterally with materials to form heterostructures. The Schottky barrier height at the interface of heterostructures can be tuned from a few millielectronvolts to several electronvolts by selecting appropriate materials or adjusting the Fermi level of graphene. This low and tunable barrier height gives rise to a great potential in developing thermionic energy converters and photodetectors. While free&#8208;standing single&#8208;layer graphene exhibits high electron mobility, its thermionic emission capability is constrained by the low density of states. This constraint can be alleviated by using 3D Dirac materials, which also possess linear energy dispersion. Thermionic emission in 3D Dirac materials is further enhanced by the emergence of nodal&#8208;ring semimetals and Weyl semimetals that exhibit linear&#8208;like energy dispersion. This review highlights recent progress in thermionic emission and devices in graphene structures and other topological materials.

This constraint can be alleviated by using 3D Dirac materials, which also possess linear energy dispersion. Thermionic emission in 3D Dirac materials is further enhanced by the emergence of nodal-ring semimetals and Weyl semimetals that exhibit linear-like energy dispersion. This review highlights recent progress in thermionic emission and devices in graphene structures and other topological materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Breaking the Reversibility Barrier in Zn&#8208;Air Systems With Dual&#8208;Electrolyte Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A separated Zn&#8208;air system is proposed to suppress hydrogen evolution and dendrites via dual&#8208;electrolyte architecture, resolving anode passivation and cathodic catalyst degradation. Integrating iodine redox chemistry enables low&#8208;voltage charging and aligns energy storage with other sustainable and green applications. 








Abstract
In response to the escalating demand for advanced energy storage solutions and the pursuit of safer, more sustainable alternatives to conventional lithium&#8208;ion batteries, addressing the reversibility and stability challenges of Zn anodes in Zn&#8208;air batteries has become imperative. To tackle these issues, particularly under alkaline conditions, a unique separated Zn&#8208;air system (SZAS) is demonstrated. This system conducts the charging process in a near&#8208;neutral electrolyte, significantly suppressing hydrogen evolution reactions and dendrite growth while discharging occurs in an alkaline electrolyte to maximize voltage output. This design effectively addresses passivation layer formation and prolongs cathode lifespan by preventing catalyst deactivation and element loss during high&#8208;voltage oxygen evolution reactions (OER). The SZASs demonstrate a 99.84% Coulombic efficiency over 5000 cycles in nearly neutral electrolytes and a discharging energy density reaching 218&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 in alkaline electrolyte, showing promise in advanced energy storage techniques. Additionally, replacing OER with iodine oxidation reaction reduces charging voltage to 1.5&#160;V and achieves a 3.7&#160;V output via serial discharging. This work proposes the separation engineering of battery architectures, integrating benefits from diverse electrolyte environments, and paves the way for aligning advancements in energy storage, waste management, material recycling, and sustainable power solutions for electric vehicles.

         <title>An Elastomeric Electrolyte Based on Lithium&#8208;Ion&#8208;Selective Transmembrane Transport for Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A class of fiber&#8208;network&#8208;based elastomeric solid electrolytes is formed through electrospinning&#8208;induced phase separation combined with in situ polymerization, featuring a structure in which an elastomeric layer with Li+&#8208;selective permeability encapsulates fibrous plastic crystals. With the merits of the interconnected ion transport channels, the lithium&#8208;ion&#8208;selective permeability, and the conformal interface, the assembled solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries incorporating this electrolyte demonstrate desirable electrochemical performance.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (SSLSBs) exhibit advantages such as high specific energy, safety, and low cost, making them an ideal candidate for next&#8208;generation batteries. However, the current mechanical and electrochemical properties of solid&#8208;state electrolytes do not meet the requirements of the practical application of SSLSBs. Herein, a construction strategy of fiber&#8208;network&#8208;based elastomeric solid electrolytes (FESE) based on electrospinning&#8208;induced phase separation is proposed. The FESE features a structure in which an elastomeric layer with Li+&#8208;selective permeability encapsulates a fibrous plastic crystal electrolyte (PCE). This structure originates from the phase separation and fiberization of a hydrogenated nitrile rubber (HNBR) stabilized emulsion, driven by electrostatic jetting. Subsequently, in situ polymerization of methoxy polyethylene glycol is performed within the battery to achieve void filling. Benefiting from the interconnected ion transport channels, the Li+&#8208;selectivity, and the conformal interface, the as&#8208;prepared FESE electrolyte achieves a high room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity of 1.11 mS cm&#8315;&#185; and a Li+ transference number of 0.77. The as&#8208;assembled SSLSB delivers a high initial discharge capacity (1188 mAh g&#8722;1), remarkable rate capability (356 mAh g&#8722;1 at 4C), and excellent cycling performance (71.2% capacity retention after 800 cycles). This research presents a constructive strategy for the elastomeric electrolytes for high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>Ultrathin Mesoporous Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bottom&#8208;up interface&#8208;directed co&#8208;assembly strategy enables the synthesis of ultrathin 2D mesoporous UiO&#8208;66(Ce) nanosheets with tunable thickness and uniform mesopores. The enhanced mass transport and accessible active sites significantly improve performance, highlighting the synergistic effects of 2D morphology and mesopores in metal&#8208;organic frameworks for applications in environmental remediation.








Abstract
Designing 2D mesoporous metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) nanosheets to overcome the limitations of bulk MOF counterparts, with a focus on enabling smooth mass transport, presents an attractive yet challenging endeavor. Here, a novel bottom&#8208;up interface&#8208;directed co&#8208;assembly method is presented for the synthesis of ultrathin 2D mesoporous UiO&#8208;66(Ce) nanosheets. The method utilizes an interface&#8208;directed co&#8208;assembly of amphiphilic perfluorooctanoic acid&#8208;induced lipid bilayers and spherical micelles from PS&#8208;b&#8208;PEO block copolymers to form unique 2D sandwich&#8208;like assemblies that guide the creation of 2D mesoporous UiO&#8208;66(Ce). The resultant 2D mesoporous UiO&#8208;66(Ce), with &#8776;23&#160;nm pore diameters and a thickness that can be tuned from 3 to 150&#160;nm, represents a substantial advancement in the application of MOFs for environmental remediation. As a model reaction, the U(VI) photoreduction benefits from the through&#8208;mesopores of its 2D morphology, which are absent in previously reported UiO&#8208;66(Ce), as they shorten the diffusion path, thereby improving mass transport and accessibility to active sites. This report demonstrates the significant role of existing mesopores in MOFs and the shape control of MOFs.

         <title>A Broad Range of Aromatic Carboxylic Acids for Photocatalytic Methane Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine learning identifies key spectroscopic features of aromatic carboxylic acids that enable selective photocatalytic oxygen activation and oxidation of CH&#8324; to methyl trifluoroacetate.








Abstract
Photocatalytic methane (CH&#8324;) activation under mild conditions presents a sustainable strategy for converting methane into valuable chemicals. This study introduces a versatile class of conjugated aromatic carboxylic acids as efficient, metal&#8208;free photocatalysts for CH&#8324; oxidation in sodium chloride&#8208;trifluoroacetic acid (NaCl&#8208;TFA) media. Spectroscopic analysis and machine learning using spectroscopic features further elucidate key structural and electronic factors influencing catalytic activity, offering predictive insights for designing high&#8208;performance photocatalysts. The carboxyl group is important in generating electron&#8208;deficient carboxyl (RC(&#9552;O)O&#8226;) or carboperoxyl radicals (RC(&#9552;O)OO&#8226;), enabling selective hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) for CH&#8324; functionalization. Mechanistic investigations indicate the role of acyl chloride intermediates in enhancing reactivity.

&lt;p&gt;Machine learning identifies key spectroscopic features of aromatic carboxylic acids that enable selective photocatalytic oxygen activation and oxidation of CH&#8324; to methyl trifluoroacetate.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photocatalytic methane (CH&#8324;) activation under mild conditions presents a sustainable strategy for converting methane into valuable chemicals. This study introduces a versatile class of conjugated aromatic carboxylic acids as efficient, metal-free photocatalysts for CH&#8324; oxidation in sodium chloride-trifluoroacetic acid (NaCl-TFA) media. Spectroscopic analysis and machine learning using spectroscopic features further elucidate key structural and electronic factors influencing catalytic activity, offering predictive insights for designing high-performance photocatalysts. The carboxyl group is important in generating electron-deficient carboxyl (RC(&#9552;O)O&#8226;) or carboperoxyl radicals (RC(&#9552;O)OO&#8226;), enabling selective hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) for CH&#8324; functionalization. Mechanistic investigations indicate the role of acyl chloride intermediates in enhancing reactivity. This work highlights the potential of aromatic carboxylic acids to address the challenges of methane functionalization, paving the way for greener chemical transformations and the utilization of inert feedstocks in sustainable chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Defects Act as a Free Surface: Role in Formation and Photophysical Properties of CsPbI3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work investigates Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) defects in vapor&#8208;deposited CsPbI3 thin films using electron microscopy, density functional theory, and optoelectronic measurements. The atomic positions at the planar defect are found comparable to those of a free surface, revealing their role in phase stabilization. While RP planes are electronically benign, antisites observed at RP corners are likely to be malign.









Abstract
The perovskite semiconductor, CsPbI3, holds excellent promise for solar cell applications due to its suitable bandgap. However, achieving phase&#8208;stable CsPbI3 solar cells with high power conversion efficiency remains a major challenge. Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) defects have been identified in a range of perovskite semiconductors, including CsPbI3. However, there is limited understanding as to why they form or their impact on stability and photophysical properties. Here, the prevalence of RP defects is increased with increased Cs&#8208;excess in vapor&#8208;deposited CsPbI3 thin films while&#160; superior structural stability but inferior photophysical properties are observed. Significantly, using electron microscopy, it is found that the atomic positions at the planar defect are comparable to those of a free surface, revealing their role in phase stabilization. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the RP planes are electronically benign, however, antisites observed at RP turning points are likely to be malign. Therefore it is proposed that increasing RP planes while reducing RP turning points offers a breakthrough for improving both phase stability and photophysical performance. The formation mechanism revealed here can apply more generally to RP structures in other perovskite systems.

         <title>High Performance P&#8208;Channel Transistor Based on Amorphous Tellurium Trioxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a breakthrough in p&#8208;channel transistors by transforming crystalline 2D tellurium into amorphous tellurium trioxide (a&#8208;TeO3) via UV&#8208;O3 treatment. This transformation enhances electronic properties, resulting in transistors with reduced hysteresis, superior on/off characteristics, and low barrier height, highlighting the potential of a&#8208;TeO3 as a novel semiconductor for future advancements in transistor technology.








Abstract
The development of high&#8208;performance p&#8208;channel transistors remains a critical challenge in complementary logic circuits, despite significant advances in n&#8208;channel transistor technologies. While amorphous oxide semiconductors have revolutionized n&#8208;type transistors, achieving comparable performance for p&#8208;type counterparts has proven elusive. Here, this study demonstrates a breakthrough in p&#8208;channel technology by transforming crystalline 2D tellurium (2D&#8208;Te) into amorphous tellurium trioxide (a&#8208;TeO3) through UV ozone treatment. This structural transformation, directly observed via high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy, induces dramatic changes in electronic properties, including significant bandgap widening and enhanced work function. The resulting a&#8208;TeO3&#8208;based p&#8208;channel transistors demonstrate remarkable improvements over crystalline 2D&#8208;Te transistors, featuring reduced hysteresis, superior on/off characteristics, and distinctive mobility behavior at different temperatures and gate fields. Most notably, these transistors achieve exceptionally low barrier height (10 meV) and sheet resistance values, while combining high hole mobility with excellent switching properties. The work not only introduces a novel high&#8208;performance p&#8208;channel semiconductor but also opens new avenues for phase engineering in advanced semiconductor development.

         <title>All&#8208;Dielectric Ultra&#8208;Broadband Microwave Absorbing Aerogel with Optimized Dielectric Dispersion via Dielectric Relaxation Time Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By incorporating fluorinated graphene into MXene aerogels, hydrogen bonding, and interfacial charge separation extend the dielectric relaxation time, enabling ultrathin (2.54 mm), lightweight (34.4 mg cm&#8315;3) all&#8208;dielectric broadband microwave absorption (9.08 GHz) due to the optimized dielectric dispersion law. The composite also delivers high compressive strength, rapid Joule heating, and excellent thermal insulation.








Abstract
The limited conceptual understanding and lack of effective techniques for optimizing dielectric dispersion continue to hinder the development of all&#8208;dielectric broadband microwave&#8208;absorbing materials (MAMs) with minimal thickness. In this study, a strong theoretical correlation between dielectric relaxation time and dielectric dispersion behavior is established by applying the ideal dielectric dispersion law in conjunction with Debye theory. This led to a strategic approach aimed at extending the relaxation time to optimize dielectric dispersion and achieve broadband microwave absorption without incorporating magnetic components. To realize this, fluorinated graphene (FG) is engineered to stack with MXene nanosheets, resulting in the fabrication of MXene/fluorinated graphene/cellulose nanofibers (MXene/FG/CNFs) aerogels. This configuration significantly extended the dielectric relaxation time of interfacial dipoles from 9.2&#160;ps in MXene/CNFs to 19.5&#160;ps in MXene/FG/CNFs aerogels, corresponding to a fluorine content of 35% in FG. This extension is attributed to increased interfacial dipole moments from strong electronic delocalization induced by highly electronegatively fluorine atoms. The improved structure yield progressively optimized dielectric dispersion, resulting in a maximum effective absorption bandwidth (EABmax) of 9.08&#160;GHz at a thickness of 2.54&#160;mm and a low density of 34.4&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;3. Moreover, the hybrid aerogel also exhibited fascinating Joule heating, thermal insulation, and compressive strength.

         <title>A Hydrogen&#8208;Aided Rechargeable Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By leveraging the faster kinetics and lower overpotential of the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), hydrogen&#8208;coupled charging enables the zinc&#8208;air battery (ZAB) to achieve ultra&#8208;fast and stable cycling performance with superior safety, which positions hydrogen aided battery&#160;(HAB) as a promising solution for electric vehicles to address challenges such as range anxiety and prolonged charging times.








Abstract
Rechargeable metal&#8211;air batteries, despite their high energy density and cost&#8208;effectiveness, suffer from sluggish cathodic reaction kinetics, resulting in high overpotential and low energy efficiency. In this study, a hydrogen&#8208;aided battery (HAB) based on zinc&#8211;air battery (ZAB) technology, which retains the discharge process of ZAB while introducing hydrogen gas into the cathode during charging, is proposed. The introduction of hydrogen replaces the conventional oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), significantly enhancing the electrochemical performance of ZAB. Leveraging the faster kinetics and lower overpotential of HOR, the hydrogen&#8208;coupled charging enables ultra&#8208;fast and stable charging (9 s to 1 mAh cm&#8722;2) with over 200 cycles. Compared to lithium&#8208;ion batteries and fuel cells, HAB exhibits superior safety by eliminating the need for flammable electrolytes and portable hydrogen storage devices. The simultaneous &#8220;refueling&#8221; of hydrogen and electricity offers rapid energy replenishment, positioning HAB as a transformative technology for electric vehicles to address key challenges such as range anxiety and prolonged charging durations. This work not only advances the performance of metal&#8211;air batteries but also provides an innovative strategy for integrating hydrogen energy into electrochemical systems.

Achieving stable operation under a wide temperature range is a critical target for the practical applications of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. However, intense lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) shuttling at high&#8208;temperature, sluggish sulfur species conversion, and inhomogeneous Li+ deposition at low&#8208;temperature severely impair the cycle lifespan of batteries. Herein, the multifunctional polymer brushes are fabricated by grafting anthraquinone&#8208;functionalized poly(glycidyl methacrylate) brushes on graphene surfaces (G&#8208;pGMAAQ) to simultaneously regulate the evolution of sulfur and lithium species. Combining theoretical calculations and experiments, it is revealed that G&#8208;pGMAAQ serves as a redox mediator that reduces the LiPSs conversion energy barrier, and its unique polar brush&#8208;like structure effectively inhibits LiPSs shuttling and homogenizes Li+ flow. Hence, G&#8208;pGMAAQ facilitates lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries stable operation in an ultra&#8208;wide temperature range (&#8722;40&#8211;70&#160;&#176;C). Furthermore, the Ah&#8208;level pouch cell achieves an energy density of 417&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, demonstrating the commercial potential of polymer brushes for lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries.

         <title>Guiding Polaritonic Energy and Momentum Through 2D Bravais Lattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The monolayer MoS2 based Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot microcavity is used to form polaritons. The directional flow control of polaritonic energy and momentum is facilitated by designing five types of 2D Bravais lattices based on PMMA nanopillars, which are fabricated on top of monolayer MoS2, as demonstrated through angle&#8208;resolved reflectance measurements. The unique ability to control exciton&#8208;polariton dispersion will advance its applications in photonics and quantum technologies.








Abstract
Controlling polariton dispersion facilitates the study of various new physical phenomena, such as Bose&#8208;Einstein condensation, polariton lasing, and coherent quantum fluid dynamics, with manual control remaining an area of ongoing exploration. In this work, monolayer MoS2 based Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot microcavity is used to form polaritons. Five types of Bravais lattices based on polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) nanopillars are intentionally designed. The energy overlap between the periodic PMMA scattering wave and the polariton establishes a coupling channel that controls the directional flow of polaritonic energy, as demonstrated through angle&#8208;resolved reflectance measurements. Back&#8208;space image measurements further demonstrate that the dispersion in reciprocal space can be directly and manually tuned, allowing for control over their number and their positions. The coupling between the polariton and PMMA scattering wave is further demonstrated by analyzing the reflectance using temporal coupled&#8208;mode theory. The symmetries of 2D Bravais lattices allow the angle between energy and momentum flow to vary widely, and the position of the dispersion branch in a specific direction can be fine&#8208;tuned via lattice constant, enabling full&#8208;range control over polariton dispersion. This work presents the first theoretical and experimental demonstrations of guiding the direction of polaritonic energy and momentum through Bravais lattice design.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Materials for Water Splitting: An Atomic Nanoengineering Approach to Sustainable Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;entropy materials (HEMs), typically composed of five or more principal elements in near&#8208;equimolar ratios, offer significant potential due to their unique properties. This review outlines the emergence and structural evolution of HEMs, followed by an in&#8208;depth discussion of the elemental roles (active sites, promoters, or stabilizers) for water splitting. Last, future research directions in this evolving field are discussed.









Abstract
Green hydrogen production via water electrolysis is pivotal for achieving energy sustainability. However, the inherently sluggish kinetics of the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction impede the progress of water&#8208;splitting technology. Recently, high&#8208;entropy materials (HEMs) composed of at least five elements have garnered significant attention as promising electrocatalysts for water splitting, owing to their compositional versatility, structural robustness, and synergistic interactions among elements. This review comprehensively explores the development of HEMs, tracing their emergence and structural evolution via atomic nanoengineering strategies (i.e., from bulk to nanostructuring, from random distributions to relatively ordered architectures, from bare HEMs to reconstructed HEMs, from intact HEMs to defective structures, from pristine HEMs to functionalized variants) and revealing how these evolutionary steps contribute to the properties and enhance catalytic performance in water splitting. The fundamental roles of individual elements (e.g., active sites, promoters, stabilizers) in shaping the structure, stability, and catalytic activity of HEMs are examined, laying a foundation for the rational design of efficient HEM&#8208;based electrocatalysts. The review also highlights recent advances in HEM&#8208;based catalysts for water splitting, emphasizing desirable properties and elemental contributions. Finally, the remaining challenges and perspectives on the future directions of HEM&#8208;based materials in energy conversion technologies are discussed.

         <title>Bioinspired Heterogeneous Spheres with Tunable Helical Structure for Accurate and Efficient Control of Sugar Blood Level</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the morphology and helical motion of Phacus helicoides, millimeter sized spheres with an inner helical structure are designed. Phacus helicoides can &#8216;mix&#8217; their surrounding medium which facilitates the acquirement of nutrients from the environment and the excretion of metabolites into the environment. Similar to Phacus helicoides, HSs can generate mixing performance under magnetic field, which led to the enhancement toward the adsorption, catalyze, and release capacities of HSs.








Abstract
Oral antidiabetic drugs remain the primary therapeutic strategy for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) due to its convenience, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and non&#8208;invasive, while achieving glycemic control in &gt;60% of patients. However, compromised bioavailability of oral antidiabetic drugs frequently leads to drug&#8208;induced hypoglycemia (sulfonylureas like glibenclamide), posing significant clinical risks. To address this issue, microstirring oral pills are designed but various challenges remain, including uncontrollable release and low biocompatibility. Here, inspired by the morphology and helical motion of Phacus helicoides, millimeter&#8208;sized spheres with an inner helical structure are designed. Owing to their inner spiral structure, helical spheres (HSs) can simultaneously self&#8208;rotate and move circularly, giving them excellent and controllable mixing capacity via an external magnetic field. Moreover, HSs can imitate metabolic processes, including the adsorption, catalysis, and release capacity of Phacus helicoides, which can effectively reduce postprandial blood glucose levels (&lt;2&#160;h) in rats with type 2 diabetes. Additionally, these novel microstirring oral spheres with inner helical structure can reduce the incidence of hypoglycemia (14.2&#8208;18.6%) of the traditional sulfanilamide drug (glibenclamide) to 3.8%. Thus, it is anticipated that HSs have a potential for drug delivery as microstrring oral pills to improve bioavailability and avoid the drug&#8208;induced hypoglycemia of T2DM patients.

         <title>Roll&#8208;To&#8208;Roll Twisted Aerogel Yarns with Reinforced Structure and Low Thermal Conductivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aerogels have exceptional thermal insulation properties, but often exhibit less satisfactory mechanical properties in textile applications. This issue is addressed by processing aerogel particles into continuous macroscopic yarns based on a roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll format through a twist&#8208;induced fibrillation method using 2D nanofiber membranes as mediators. The resulting aerogel yarns show high strength, ideal flexibility, and impressive thermal insulation properties.








Abstract
Aerogels have been considered as super thermal insulators. However, they often exhibit less satisfactory mechanical properties for textile application due to their fragility and poor processability. These problems are overcome through a twisting&#8208;induced fibrillation method, using 2D nanofiber membranes as mediators, to process aerogel particles into continuous macroscopic yarns based on a roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll format. A low concentration of strong nanofiber host in twisted form provides structural support to the aerogel particles and preserves their porous architecture. Despite the high&#8208;volume ratio (&#8776;78%) of aerogel particles, the aerogel yarns show high strength, ideal flexibility, and impressive thermal insulation properties. Textiles woven with the aerogel yarns are warmer than cashmere. The aerogel textile is extremely stable under temperatures of &#8722;196 and 100&#160;&#176;C, mechanical deformation, and even washing. This technology provides a flexible platform to extend the function (e.g., dyeability, hydrophobicity, and Joule heating) of aerogel yarns and textiles to suit various use scenarios.

         <dc:description>
Compact, robust, and ultralow&#8208;loss on&#8208;chip photonic devices are essential for densely integrated photonic chips. Here, the underlying radiation mechanism in topological valley edge states is unveiled and a new methodology of interface topology driven bandgap and wavevector engineering is proposed to thoroughly suppress their radiation losses, thereby unleashing their full potential for robust, low&#8208;power, and densely integrated photonic chips.









Abstract
Compact, robust, and ultralow&#8208;loss on&#8208;chip photonic devices are essential for densely integrated photonic chips. Conventional designs struggle to achieve these properties due to their inherent trade&#8208;offs among compactness, robustness, and low loss. Topological valley photonic crystals (VPCs) offer a promising solution, as their valley&#8208;vortex&#8208;protected edge states are capable of robustly guiding light through sharp bends and structural perturbations with negligible loss. Notably, exhaustive control over all loss channels is crucial for minimizing undesired losses. However, the intrinsic loss mechanisms in valley edge states remain largely unexplored, severely limiting their full potential. Here, we unveil that radiation is the dominant&#160;loss mechanism in valley edge states and propose a new methodology of interface topology driven bandgap and wavevector engineering to thoroughly suppress their radiation losses in chip&#8208;scale waveguides and cavities. The methodology minimizes the radiation losses of topological cavities by &#8776;104&#8208;fold through readily tailoring interface geometry without compromising their compactness, ultimately achieving a measured loaded Q&#8208;factor of 31231.2 in the terahertz (THz) frequency regime. Furthermore, the enhanced Q&#8208;factor significantly strengthens light&#8208;matter interactions, enabling efficient spectral modulation with ultralow&#8208;power photoexcitation. These findings enable topological VPCs to realize ultra&#8208;compact and ultralow&#8208;loss devices across diverse frequencies, unleashing their full potential for robust, low&#8208;power, and densely integrated photonic chips.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance GaN/BAs Heterojunctions: Dual Functionality of BAs for Enhanced Electrical and Thermal Management in Power Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The integration of BAs with GaN via surface&#8208;activated bonding yields a high&#8208;quality heterojunction with rectification ratio of &gt;107. Atomic&#8208;scale interface analysis reveals that an optimized amorphous layer enhances the electrical performances. BAs serves as both an active p&#8208;type semiconductor and a high&#8208;thermal&#8208;conductive substrate in GaN/BAs heterojunction, highlighting its potential for high&#8208;power&#8208;density applications.








Abstract
Benefit from the unusually outstanding thermal and electrical transport properties, the integration of cubic boron arsenide (BAs) with other semiconductors presents a promising avenue for advanced electronic and optoelectronic devices. However, assemblage of BAs&#8208;based devices poses significant challenges due to constraints in BAs growth conditions. In this study, gallium nitride/BAs (GaN/BAs) heterojunctions are fabricated using the surface&#8208;activated bonding method, achieving high&#8208;quality interfaces. The heterojunctions demonstrate a rectification ratio exceeding 107, with atomic characterizations revealing enhanced performance at intermediate layer thicknesses below 20 nm. On the thermal front, BAs significantly improve heat dissipation outperforming GaN configurations under identical conditions. The fabrication of dual&#8208;functional BAs&#8208;based structures, where BAs works as an active p&#8208;type semiconductor and an efficient cooling substrate simultaneously, highlights its potential for next&#8208;generation power electronics, where both electrical performance and thermal management are crucial.

         <title>Janus Cellular Design Drives Solar&#8208;Powered Spatial Lithium Extraction and Water Co&#8208;Generation from Salt&#8208;Lake Brines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D&#8208;printed Janus cellular solar platform integrates photothermal evaporation, ion&#8208;diffusion&#8208;guided lithium enrichment, and flipping&#8208;induced salt removal. The asymmetric lattice, fabricated via high&#8208;resolution printing and functionalized with porous adsorbents, enables simultaneous water harvesting and selective lithium extraction from hypersaline brines, offering a scalable and energy&#8208;efficient route for sustainable resource recovery.








Abstract
Lithium plays a vital role in energy storage technologies, with global demand rapidly increasing. Current adsorption&#8208;based direct lithium extraction from salt&#8208;lake brines holds promise but suffers from low ion extraction efficiency due to sluggish intercalation kinetics and poor selectivity, necessitating repeated cycles that increase water and energy consumption. Here, a Janus cellular&#8208;structured solar&#8208;powered platform (JCSP) is developed for energy&#8208;efficient lithium extraction and sustainable water harvesting. The cellular platform features a symmetrical, multi&#8208;branched cantilever geometry with distinct upper and lower lattice architectures, where the lower lattice is functionalized with titanium&#8208;based porous adsorbents. This rational lattice design and functionalized adsorption interfaces enhance light absorption, sustain evaporative flow, and create an ion diffusion gradient for selective lithium extraction. Its cantilever configuration enables a self&#8208;flipping mechanism, preventing salt crystallization and ensuring long&#8208;term stability in high&#8208;salinity environments. This design boosts water evaporation efficiency to 3.85&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1, increases lithium adsorption capacity to 43.5&#160;mg g&#8722;1, and enhances Li+/Na+ and Li+/Mg2+ selectivity to 112 and 268, respectively, when treating multi&#8208;ionic hypersaline environment (20 wt% total dissolved salt). The JCSP system demonstrates stable long&#8208;term performance in water evaporation and lithium recovery under extreme conditions, providing a sustainable solution to global water scarcity and rising lithium demand.

         <title>Liver&#8208;Targeted Tolerogenic Vaccines: A Nano&#8208;Membrane Coupled Approach for Autoimmune Disease Therapies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tolerogenic vaccine based on a membrane&#8208;nanoemulsion is developed to specifically target hepatic antigen&#8208;presenting cells. These cells recognize signals such as phosphatidylserine on the membrane; while, reducing the expression of costimulatory molecules. This contributes to a deficiency in T cell activation signals and induces multiple subsets of regulatory T cells and regulatory B cells, protecting against autoimmune tissue damage.









Abstract
The co&#8208;delivery of auto&#8208;antigens and immunomodulators for tolerance induction holds great potential in the treatment of autoimmune diseases. However, their efficacy in enriching antigens within target cells remains limited, and the use of immunomodulators poses a risk for systemic immunosuppression. Here, an apoptotic erythrocyte&#8208;derived membrane is developed for the first time, demonstrating its strong abilities to target hepatic antigen&#8208;presenting cells (APCs) and stimulate negative regulatory pathways. These apoptotic cell membranes are engineered onto the surface of intravenous lipid emulsions encapsulating disease&#8208;associated antigens to generate a tolerogenic vaccine. This nano&#8208;membrane coupled structure facilitates robust antigen loading, efficient liver delivery, and uptake by hepatic APCs; while, concurrently downregulating the expression of costimulatory molecules to promote immune tolerance. Intravenous administration of this tolerogenic vaccine induces multiple regulatory cell subpopulations, particularly IL&#8208;10 secreting T cells, regulatory B cells, and memory regulatory T cells, collectively conferring effective protection against celiac disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and type 1 diabetes in murine models. More importantly, it is demonstrated that this vaccine induces antigen&#8208;specific immune tolerance without compromising the normal immune responses to other antigens. The findings provide solid support for the application of this hepatic APCs&#8208;targeted tolerogenic vaccine as a versatile and translatable platform for combating autoimmune diseases.

         <title>Design of a Tunable, High&#8208;performance Mixed Matrix Membrane Platform for Gas Separations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance, flexible, tunable, and non&#8208;aging mixed matrix membrane platform is developed by incorporating CHA zeolites, featuring a 3D pore system with precise molecular&#8208;sieving and tunable chemical interactions, into a polyimide matrix at exceptionally high loadings. This tunable membrane platform significantly outperforms state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes across a wide range of critical applications and can be beneficial for next&#8208;generation molecular separation membrane developments with vast industrial potential.








Abstract
Membrane technology offers substantial economic and environmental benefits for energy&#8208;intensive chemical separations. Chabazite&#8208;type zeolite, possessing a 3&#8208;D channel system with molecular&#8208;sieving windows, can be an ideal membrane material, but conditions to synthesize zeolite&#8208;only membranes limit optimization strategies. Guided by advanced quantum chemistry calculations on inner&#8208;pore molecular interactions, zeolite properties are tailored for different separations and optimized particles incorporated in polyimide at very high loadings. A membrane platform is thus created that largely outperforms state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes for a broad variety of industry&#8208;relevant applications, that is, carbon capture, natural gas/biogas purification, hydrocarbon, helium and hydrogen recovery. Accurate size&#8208;sieving of gas molecules is realized together with rational determination of optimal gas&#8208;zeolite interactions. Crucial for industrial applications, these well&#8208;tuned membranes displayed excellent non&#8208;aging properties, high flexibility and higher mixed&#8208;gas selectivities than ideal&#8208;gas selectivities. Moreover, they performed even better at low CO2&#8208;partial pressure in CO2&#8208;removal and can be made humidity&#8208;insensitive.

&lt;p&gt;A high-performance, flexible, tunable, and non-aging mixed matrix membrane platform is developed by incorporating CHA zeolites, featuring a 3D pore system with precise molecular-sieving and tunable chemical interactions, into a polyimide matrix at exceptionally high loadings. This tunable membrane platform significantly outperforms state-of-the-art membranes across a wide range of critical applications and can be beneficial for next-generation molecular separation membrane developments with vast industrial potential.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Membrane technology offers substantial economic and environmental benefits for energy-intensive chemical separations. Chabazite-type zeolite, possessing a 3-D channel system with molecular-sieving windows, can be an ideal membrane material, but conditions to synthesize zeolite-only membranes limit optimization strategies. Guided by advanced quantum chemistry calculations on inner-pore molecular interactions, zeolite properties are tailored for different separations and optimized particles incorporated in polyimide at very high loadings. A membrane platform is thus created that largely outperforms state-of-the-art membranes for a broad variety of industry-relevant applications, that is, carbon capture, natural gas/biogas purification, hydrocarbon, helium and hydrogen recovery. Accurate size-sieving of gas molecules is realized together with rational determination of optimal gas-zeolite interactions. Crucial for industrial applications, these well-tuned membranes displayed excellent non-aging properties, high flexibility and higher mixed-gas selectivities than ideal-gas selectivities. Moreover, they performed even better at low CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-partial pressure in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-removal and can be made humidity-insensitive.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Hydrophobic and High Surface Charge Phosphate Interphase for High Areal Capacity Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust hydrophobic and high&#8208;surface&#8208;charge phosphate interphase dramatically fosters uniform Zn deposition at the (100) plane, realizing an unprecedented Sand's capacity of over 64 mAh cm&#8722;2. The synergy of a narrower Zn2&#8314;&#8208;rich electric double layer and suppressed side reactions delivers stable Zn metal batteries with high areal capacity, long lifespan, and practical viability.








Abstract
Commercial zinc metal batteries require an areal capacity above 4 mAh cm&#8722;2 at high rates. However, such performance is rarely reported due to slow mass transport between the diffuse layer and the outer Helmholtz layer at the interface. Herein, it is reported an unprecedented Sand's capacity exceeding 64 mAh cm&#8722;2&#160;at 20 mA cm&#8722;2, enabled by a hydrophobic and high surface charge iron/zinc phosphate (FZP) nanofilm serving as an artificial solid electrolyte interphase for zinc anode. It is identified the key role of high surface charge with strong Zn2&#8314; affinity, which mitigates depletion zones by forming a narrower and Zn2+&#8208;rich electric double layer, thereby achieving high areal capacities and promoting preferential exposure of the Zn (100) plane. Consequently, FZP/Zn exhibits stable cycling for 400 h under 60% depth&#8208;of&#8208;discharge (2.14 mAh cm&#8722;2). Full cells with a low N/P ratio deliver an energy density of 176.5 Wh kg&#8722;1 electrodes at 6 mAh cm&#8722;2. The practical Zn&#8208;I2 pouch cells are further demonstrated with &#8776;97 Ah of cumulative capacity and a high areal capacity of 5.12 mAh cm&#8722;2. These findings establish FZP nanofilms as a viable strategy for realizing commercial high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Ternary Inert Element Co&#8208;Doping: a New Approach to Stable 4.7&#160;V LiCoO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Al&#8211;Mg&#8211;Ni inert co&#8208;doping synergistically enhances structural stability of LiCoO2 at highly delithiated state, with Mg/Ni stabilizing Li layers and suppressing oxygen loss, while Al reinforcing Co&#8211;O octahedra, giving a capacity retention of 58.6% after 600 cycles at 4.7&#160;V.








Abstract
LiCoO2 (LCO) has long dominated the cathode materials in portable electronic batteries due to its high volumetric energy density. However, the pursuit of higher voltages to achieve larger capacities remains a challenge due to severer structural degradation. Herein, a ternary inert element co&#8208;doping strategy that can greatly improve the structure stability of LCOs at elevated voltages is reported. Mg and Ni doping at Li site support the layered structure in the highly delithiated state, while Ni also facilitates the separation of O 2p and Co 3d orbits, thereby suppressing oxygen loss. Meanwhile, Al doping at Co site suppresses the distortion of Co&#8211;O octahedra and stabilizes the Co layers. The synergistic effects of Al, Mg and Ni co&#8208;doping inhibit the irreversible H3&#8211;H1&#8208;3 phase transitions and mitigate internal stress accumulation. The Al&#8211;Mg&#8211;Ni co&#8208;doped LCO exhibits a capacity of 221&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 with a capacity retention of 65.5% after 1500 cycles at 4.6&#160;V. At a higher voltage of 4.7&#160;V, it delivers a capacity of 225.8&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 with a capacity retention of 58.6% after 600 cycles. This multiple inert elements co&#8208;doping strategy gives an effective method for stabilizing the high&#8208;voltage LCO and other related layered oxide materials.

         <title>Unlocking NIR&#8208;II Photoluminescence in 2D Copper Tetrasilicate Nanosheets through Flame Spray Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flame&#8208;spray&#8208;pyrolysis method is presented to synthesize ultra&#8208;bright CTS nanosheets with tunable NIR&#8208;II emission. Achieving quantum yields up to 34%, these materials support high&#8208;speed imaging and enable super&#8208;resolution in vivo applications such as transcranial microcirculation mapping and macrophage tracking.









Abstract
Expanding fluorescence bioimaging into the second near&#8208;infrared spectrum (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700&#160;nm) unlocks advanced possibilities for diagnostics and therapeutics, offering superior tissue penetration and resolution. 2D copper tetrasilicate (CTS) pigments (MCuSi4O10, M = Ca, Sr, Ba) are known for their brightness and stability, yet synthetic challenges have curbed their integration into bioimaging. Here, flame&#8208;spray&#8208;pyrolysis (FSP) is introduced as a versatile and scalable synthesis approach to produce ultra&#8208;bright, metastable CTS nanosheets (NS) by annealing multi&#8208;element metal oxide nanoparticles into 2D crystals through calcination or laser irradiation. Group&#8208;II ion incorporation shifts emission into the NIR&#8208;II range, with Ba0.33Sr0.33Ca0.33CuSi4O10 peaking at 1007&#160;nm, while minor Mg&#8208;doping induces a hypsochromic shift and extends fluorescence lifetimes. The engineered CTS achieves quantum yields of up to 34%, supporting NS high&#8208;frame&#8208;rate imaging (&gt; 200 fps). These unique properties enable CTS&#8208;NS to serve as powerful contrast agents for super&#8208;resolution NIR bioimaging, demonstrated in vivo through transcranial microcirculation mapping and macrophage tracking in mice using diffuse optical localization imaging (DOLI). This pioneering synthesis strategy unlocks wavelength&#8208;tunable NS for advanced NIR&#8208;II bioimaging applications.

         <title>Porogen&#8208;Integrated Rapid Oxidation Enables Structured Mesoporous Metal Oxide Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porogen&#8208;integrated rapid oxidation (PiRO) is a method for high throughput manufacturing of mesoporous metal oxide thin films. PiRO generates up to 500 nm thick layers with through&#8208;plane 5&#8211;10 nm spheroidal close&#8208;packed pores at 230&#160;&#176;C in 30 min or less. The reduced temperatures enable deposition on both rigid and flexible polymeric substrates using roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll compatible techniques.









Abstract
Structured metal oxide films have promise in optoelectronics, sensing, energy storage, and catalysis but their uptake is predominately limited due to their long and high&#8208;temperature syntheses. Here, a self&#8208;assembling polymer is used which can act as a chelating fuel source in a solution combustion reaction to generate highly structured mesoporous aluminum oxide films at &lt;250&#160;&#176;C in a matter of minutes through a process termed porogen&#8208;integrated rapid oxidation (PiRO). The resulting films with thicknesses up to 500 nm show an open&#8208;cell, face&#8208;centered cubic structure of spheroidal pores. Further, an additional ligand can be included to control the self&#8208;assembly step to yield both through&#8208;film ordering or tunable disordering for increased pore volume as confirmed by both grazing incidence small angle X&#8208;ray scattering and ellipsometry. Finally, roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll manufacturing with PiRO is demonstrated on flexible polymeric substrates. The method offers a tunable, scalable, low&#8208;temperature, and lower&#8208;cost method to generate large&#8208;area structured mesoporous metal oxide films.

         <title>Scalable Jet Swimmer Driven by Pulsatile Artificial Muscles&#160;and Soft Chamber Buckling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by nautiluses, a scalable robotic jet swimmer is developed, featuring a soft chamber that buckles instantly to amplify jetting speed. It demonstrates the successful integration of smart materials and smart structures in a robotic system, offering a promising pathway for developing efficient, adaptable, and intelligent underwater soft robots.








Abstract
Cephalopods, such as squid and nautilus, achieve fast swimming by jetting water swiftly from their chambers, offering benefits in swimming speed, energy efficiency, and silent operation. Inspired by these animals, a scalable soft robotic jet swimmer that utilizes soft chamber buckling to enable rapid water jetting is proposed. The design incorporates three main components: the knotted artificial muscle (KAM), an origami&#8208;inspired soft chamber, and a custom control module. The KAM generates significant force and stroke with minimal self&#8208;weight, but its actuation speed is insufficient for propelling water. To address this limit, an origami&#8208;inspired soft chamber that buckles instantly when the KAM's pulling force reaches a critical threshold is designed, thereby amplifying actuation speed and enabling rapid water jetting. The control module periodically activates the KAM to tighten and release, facilitating effective pulsatile propulsion. Similar to Cephalopods, this design is scalable and robust. Effective swimming of two robots is demonstrated with drastically different sizes, achieving a top speed of 0.62 body length per second. We also show that the propulsion is minimally compromised even when the KAM is significantly damaged. To further enable guided locomotion, a shape memory alloy rudder is incorporated for steering via infrared stimulation. This work demonstrates successful pulsatile jet swimming through the integration of smart materials and smart structures, laying the groundwork for future innovations in underwater soft&#160;robotics.

3D flow&#8208;focusing devices are an ideal platform for the processing and integration of functional materials within polymeric matrices. In this article, A. Tuan Ngo, D. Aguil&#224;, T. Sotto Mayor, M. Palacios&#8208;Corella, J. Puigmart&#237;&#8208;Luis show the on&#8208;the&#8208;fly processing of a prototypical SCO material&#8212;known for its challenging processability&#8212;thereby opening new avenues for its implementation in real&#8208;world applications.









Abstract
Spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) molecular&#8208;based switches have shown promise across a range of applications since their discovery, including sensing, information storage, actuators, and displays. Yet limited processability remains a barrier to their real&#8208;world implementation, as traditional methods for integrating SCO materials into polymer matrices are often complex, expensive, and prone to producing uneven material distributions. Herein, we demonstrate how 3D flow&#8208;focusing chemistry enables unprecedented control for the direct fabrication of SCO composite materials, addressing key challenges in processability, scalability, and cost. By using a 3D coaxial flow&#8208;focusing microfluidic device, we simultaneously synthesize [Fe(Htrz)2(trz)](BF4) and achieve its homogeneous incorporation into alginate fibers in a continuous manner. The device&#8217;s versatility allows for precise manipulation of the reaction&#8208;diffusion (RD) zone, resulting in SCO composite fibers with tunable physicochemical and magnetic properties. Additionally, we demonstrate the ability to isolate these fibers as freestanding architectures and highlight the potential for printing them with defined shapes. Finally, we show that the 3D control of the RD zone granted by continuous flow microfluidic devices offers precise spatiotemporal control over the distribution of SCO complexes within the fibers, effectively encoding SCO materials into them. SCO&#8208;encoded fibers can seamlessly combine adaptability and functionality, offering innovative solutions for application&#8208;specific customization.

         <title>Homogeneous &#8220;Hard&#8208;Soft&#8221; Biphasic Bone Adhesives Promote Comminuted Fracture Healing through Interfacial Adaptation and Mechanical Property Maintenance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the instant and sustainable fixation of bone fragments in treating highly comminuted fractures, phase engineering is employed to construct a homogeneous hard&#8208;soft biphasic bone adhesive (PTN). The conversion of tetracalcium phosphate in the hard phase and the deposition of hydroxyapatite in the soft phase endow its anti&#8208;swelling and mechanical resistance while adapting to the interfacial changes for sustainable adhesion.








Abstract
Bone adhesives provide remarkable clinical solutions in treating highly comminuted fractures that are difficult to perform surgery with metal fixation. However, no commercial bone adhesives exhibit high adhesion, strength, and osteogenic activity for instant and sustainable fixation in dynamic, wet humoral environments at weight&#8208;bearing sites. Here, phase engineering is employed to construct a homogeneous hard&#8208;soft biphasic bone adhesive (HB&#8208;PTN) with a sea urchin&#8208;inspired structure of phosphorylated polyglutamic acid (P&#8208;PGA) encapsulating tetracalcium phosphate (TTCP) (hard phase) and a viscoelastic hydrogel composed of amino&#8208;functionalized PEGylated poly (glycerol sebacate) (PEGS&#8208;NH2) and P&#8208;PGA (soft phases) for immediate, stable fixation. The adhesion and strength of the HB&#8208;PTN hydrogel can be tuned by modulating the soft phase/hard phase ratio. The PTN&#8208;2 hydrogel exhibited an adhesive strength of &#8776;280 kPa, a compressive modulus of &#8776;1.02 MPa, and high fatigue resistance (92%). Moreover, the PTN&#8208;2 hydrogel showed limited swelling (130%) and maintained mechanical properties (102%) after immersion in simulated human body fluid. Furthermore, this strategy avoids the agglomeration of inorganic particles and the formation of cracks due to stress concentration observed with traditional mixing methods. In vivo, the PTN adhesives reveal durable and stable adhesion and accelerate fracture healing, demonstrating great clinical potential in comminuted fracture repair.

         <title>Electric Field Driven Soft Morphing Matter</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents soft morphing matter robots that exhibit extremely high morphological adaptability and complex multimodal electric field response. They can undergo large, controlled body deformation and show complex locomotion on different terrains under the manipulation of external electric fields, making a significant step beyond current electroactive and soft robots.








Abstract
The manipulation of soft morphing robots using external electric fields and wireless control is challenging. Electric field&#8208;driven soft morphing matter, termed electro&#8208;morphing gel (e&#8208;MG), that exhibits complex multimodal large&#8208;scale deformation (showing up to 286% strain, and strain rates up to 500%&#160;s&#8722;1) and locomotion under external electric fields applied using compact and lightweight electrodes is presented. The distinctive capabilities of e&#8208;MG derive from the combination of an elastomeric matrix and nanoparticulate paracrystalline carbon. The material properties, electroactive principle, and control strategies are explored and demonstrate fundamental morphing matter behaviors including rotating, translating, stretching, spreading, bending, and twisting. A range of potential bio&#8208;inspired applications, including slim mold&#8208;like spreading, snail&#8208;like jumping over a gap, object transport, wall climbing, and a frog tongue&#8208;inspired gripper is shown. The e&#8208;MG provides morphing capabilities beyond the current limitations in wireless control for a wide range of applications in soft and bio&#8208;inspired robotics, dexterous manipulation, and space exploration.

         <title>Materials Evolution by Programmed Twisting: a DNA&#8208;Inspired Ultrastrong Supercoiled Conformational Fiber for Energy&#8208;Storage and Buffering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the supercoiled conformational structures and behaviors of the DNA chain, a material evolution strategy via supercoiled conformational fibers (SCFs) is proposed to achieve a number of extra&#8208;ordinary properties/functions, including pseudo&#8208;entropic elasticity, high&#8208;performance torsional energy&#8208;storage, stimulus&#8208;triggered energy release, impact buffering, and self&#8208;reinforcement.








Abstract
The conformational folding/unfolding behaviors of DNA supercoils serve as a fundamental mechanism governing ultradense bio&#8208;information storage and precise genetic transcription. Mimicking those nanoscale dynamic conformational behaviors for macroscopic materials to achieve unusual functionalities will be of great interest but remains unexplored. Herein, a DNA&#8208;inspired materials evolution paradigm is presented to create multifunctional supercoiled conformational fibers (SCFs) by programmed twisting controlled self&#8208;buckling. Through the programmed twist&#8208;stress modulation, a low&#8208;density polyethylene strip is transformed into high&#8208;performance DNA&#8208;like SCF through a unique multiscale microstructure evolution process. This DNA&#8208;like SCF exhibits five hallmark characteristics unattainable before, including ultra&#8208;large elastic deformability (900 &#177; 50%), metal&#8208;level mechanical strength (330 &#177; 30&#160;MPa), unprecedented torsional energy&#8208;storage density (16.1 &#177; 0.6&#160;kJ&#160;kg&#8722;1), torsional energy release upon appropriate stimulations, and impact buffering through conformation&#8208;mediated energy&#8208;dissipation. Characterization reveals that these unexpected energy&#8208;related properties mainly are contributed by the multiscale twisting&#8208;reinforced microstructures and conformation mechanics. Potential applications of the SCFs are demonstrated finally by harvest&#8208;and&#8208;storage of wind energy and soft&#8208;landing. The DNA&#8208;like SCFs indicate a general platform for materials evolution with extraordinary mechanics and functions.

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the supercoiled conformational structures and behaviors of the DNA chain, a material evolution strategy via supercoiled conformational fibers (SCFs) is proposed to achieve a number of extra-ordinary properties/functions, including pseudo-entropic elasticity, high-performance torsional energy-storage, stimulus-triggered energy release, impact buffering, and self-reinforcement.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conformational folding/unfolding behaviors of DNA supercoils serve as a fundamental mechanism governing ultradense bio-information storage and precise genetic transcription. Mimicking those nanoscale dynamic conformational behaviors for macroscopic materials to achieve unusual functionalities will be of great interest but remains unexplored. Herein, a DNA-inspired materials evolution paradigm is presented to create multifunctional supercoiled conformational fibers (SCFs) by programmed twisting controlled self-buckling. Through the programmed twist-stress modulation, a low-density polyethylene strip is transformed into high-performance DNA-like SCF through a unique multiscale microstructure evolution process. This DNA-like SCF exhibits five hallmark characteristics unattainable before, including ultra-large elastic deformability (900 &#177; 50%), metal-level mechanical strength (330 &#177; 30&#160;MPa), unprecedented torsional energy-storage density (16.1 &#177; 0.6&#160;kJ&#160;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), torsional energy release upon appropriate stimulations, and impact buffering through conformation-mediated energy-dissipation. Characterization reveals that these unexpected energy-related properties mainly are contributed by the multiscale twisting-reinforced microstructures and conformation mechanics. Potential applications of the SCFs are demonstrated finally by harvest-and-storage of wind energy and soft-landing. The DNA-like SCFs indicate a general platform for materials evolution with extraordinary mechanics and functions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Integrated Polarization, Distance, and Rotation for Multi&#8208;DoF Diffractive Processor and Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;DoF processor is designed to perform versatile inference tasks, including single&#8208;/dual&#8208;digit and single&#8208;/dual&#8208;fashion product classification, logic operations, and image transformation. Moreover, a high&#8208;security information transmission framework is experimentally demonstrated that transforms a large volume of input data&#8212;encoded across multiple channels&#8212;into Morse code, with the true information subsequently synthesized through further decoding.








Abstract
All&#8208;optical diffractive deep neural networks (D2NNs) offer significant advantages in processing speed and power consumption, thereby accelerating the development of optical computing and artificial intelligence (AI). Integrating multiple degrees of freedom (multi&#8208;DoF) into D2NNs is a pivotal role in improving information processing and task&#8208;loading capacity, an enormous challenge in current all&#8208;optical diffractive computing/processors. Here, a multi&#8208;DoF diffractive processor is proposed and experimentally demonstrated that leverages a metasurfaces&#8208;based approach to integrate polarization, distance, and rotation channels for versatile inference tasks and information encryption. The approach is validated using three&#8208;layer metasurfaces that enable high task&#8208;capacity tasks, including single&#8208;/dual&#8208;digit and single&#8208;/dual&#8208;fashion&#8208;product classification, logic operators, and image transformation. Moreover, by mapping large volumes of input data into multi&#8208;DoF channels and encoding the information in Morse code with our D2NNs framework, a high&#8208;security information transmission system is experimentally implemented. The integration of polarization, distance, and rotation channels into an all&#8208;optical diffractive processor with multifunctional capabilities paves the way for multifunctional integrated devices and communication.

         <title>Fluorine&#8211;Mediated Interfacial Microenvironment for Boosting pH&#8211;Universal CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni species (single atoms and atomic clusters) are successfully anchored onto fluorocarbon substrates (FC), forming a highly efficient and stable CO2RR electrocatalyst. The optimized Ni/FC exhibits excellent FECO in acidic, neutral, and alkaline electrolytes, respectively. More importantly, Ni/FC can maintain excellent FECO while operating at industrial currents density for 3000&#160;h. Mechanistic studies reveal that the high&#8211;electronegativity of F will cause the formation of a positive C&#948;+ center, which inhibits the adsorption of hydrogen and elevates the dissociation energy barrier of interfacial water, thereby suppressing the competitive HER process.








Abstract
Achieving highly efficient and stable conversion of carbon dioxide&#160;reduction reaction (CO2RR) into value&#8208;added chemicals at industrial current density is crucial but challenging due to its complex gas&#8211;solid&#8211;liquid interface. Here the local microenvironment of three&#8211;phase interface is successfully regulated to boost the CO2RR performance of Ni species in the universal pH range by introducing the highly electronegative F. The optimized Ni/FC achieves high&#8211;performance in converting CO2 to CO with Faraday efficiencies (FEs) over 90% in pH&#8211;universal conditions, while the main product of Ni/C is H2, especially under acidic conditions. Significantly, it can steadily operate at a high current density of 200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for over 3000&#160;h in a broad pH range, outperforming most recently reported CO2RR electrocatalysts. Detail in situ experiments and density functional theory calculations reveal that the presence of highly electronegative F will cause the formation of a positive C&#948;+ center, which inhibits the adsorption of hydrogen and increases the dissociation energy barrier of interfacial water, thereby suppressing the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). This work highlights the importance of regulating the local microenvironment of interfacial water, providing a new perspective in the field of electrocatalysis for suppressing competitive HER.

         <title>Unveiling the Multifunctional Potential of MXenes in Rechargeable Batteries beyond Electrode Active Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides comprehensive perspectives on MXene's application as passive components in rechargeable battery systems, as current collectors, electrolytes additives, separators, binders, and hosts for active materials. It aims to forecast the multifunctional potential of MXenes in batteries, gain valuable insights into their broader applicability, and contribute to the innovation of energy storage systems.








Abstract
MXene materials have emerged as prominent candidates for revolutionizing energy storage technologies due to their unique properties and versatile applications. This review highlights the multifaceted roles of MXenes (beyond electrode active materials) in improving various components of rechargeable batteries. MXenes exhibit exceptional electrical conductivity, tunable surface functionalities, and a 2D structure, rendering them suitable for enhancing electrode or electrolyte materials, current collectors, binders, and separators. As electrode hosts, MXenes accommodate active materials such as sulfur, silicon, selenium, and novel compounds, addressing challenges related to volume expansion, electronic conductivity, and chemical interactions. Furthermore, MXene&#8208;based conductive agents and additives ameliorate the stability and performance of solid&#8208;state devices, overcoming issues associated with flammable liquid electrolytes. MXene materials excel as current collectors by improving contact between active materials, mitigating dendrite formation, extending battery lifespan, and improving safety. Additionally, MXene&#8208;modified separators and interlayers effectively hinder the shuttle effect and dendrite growth in Li&#8208;S and other battery systems with stability and longevity. With their distinct attributes to offer transformative opportunities for addressing limitations in next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries, MXenes hold the promise of shaping a more efficient, secure, and sustainable energy storage landscape.

         <title>Emerging Surface Engineering Methods for Lithium Metal Anodes: Critical Review Beyond Conventional SEI and Surface Coatings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores innovative strategies to overcome the limitations of traditional lithium metal anodes by focusing on tunable SEI designs, chemical synergies, and advanced fabrication techniques. It highlights recent breakthroughs that improve battery performance and safety while proposing integrative approaches to address remaining challenges for practical applications.








Abstract
For rechargeable lithium batteries with high energy density, lithium metal anode is an ideal candidate due to its high theoretical capacity (3860 mAh g&#8722;1) and low electrode potential (&#8722;3.04&#160;V versus standard hydrogen electrode). Despite its promising characteristics, it faces formidable obstacles such as dendritic growth and poor formation of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers. To overcome such obstacles, multifaceted unconventional surface engineering approaches are hypothesized, tested, and examined. In this review, in addition to the conventional SEI and surface coatings, the principles and recent progress of the unconventional surface engineering methods are summarized and assessed, based on the interfacial thermodynamics and factors governing the interface between the electrode and the electrolyte. It connects and provides the newest insight on material science, design methodologies, and fabrication techniques, which require significant attention. This review reveals the significance of unconventional methods in enhancing both electrochemical performance and safety of the next&#8208;generation lithium metal batteries, providing a comprehensive understanding of the current research landscape and roadmaps for future technological breakthroughs.

Materials Research at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology
The campus in Hong Kong is situated on a hillside that overlooks Clear Water Bay, offering breathtaking views of the bay and the South China Sea. At the heart of the campus, the Red Bird sundial stands as a prominent sculpture of the university. This piece is inspired by one of humanity's earliest scientific achievements: the sundial. Constructed from steel, the sundial is gracefully placed on a paved podium with broad steps, surrounded by a flowing water pool. The podium features a carved mural celebrating 39 notable Chinese contributions to science and technology. Completed on October 8, 1991, the Red Bird sundial, titled &#8220;Circle of Time,&#8221; has become an enduring symbol of HKUST.

         <title>Promotion of C&#9472;C Coupling in the CO2 Electrochemical Reduction to Valuable C2+ Products: From Micro&#8208;Foundation to Macro&#8208;Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 23, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Promotion of C&#9472;C Coupling in electrochemical reduction of CO2 to valuable C2+ products is reviewed from microcosmic to macroscopic. The discussed advances and outstanding challenges in the strategies of efficient catalyst design, the influence of local environment in electrolyte, and the design of potential industrial flow cells provided the guidelines for future research in promoted C&#9472;C coupling from foundation to application.








Abstract
The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to valuable C2+ products emerges as a promising strategy for converting intermittent renewable energy into high&#8208;energy&#8208;density fuels and feedstock. Leveraging its substantial commercial potential and compatibility with existing energy infrastructure, the electrochemical conversion of CO2 into multicarbon hydrocarbons and oxygenates (C2+) holds great industrial promise. However, the process is hampered by complex multielectron&#8208;proton transfer reactions and difficulties in reactant activation, posing significant thermodynamic and kinetic barriers to the commercialization of C2+ production. Addressing these barriers necessitates a comprehensive approach encompassing multiple facets, including the effective control of C&#9472;C coupling in industrial electrolyzers using efficient catalysts in optimized local environments. This review delves into the advancements and outstanding challenges spanning from the microcosmic to macroscopic scales, including the design of nanocatalysts, optimization of the microenvironment, and the development of macroscopic electrolyzers. By elucidating the influence of the local electrolyte environment, and exploring the design of potential industrial flow cells, guidelines are provided for future research aimed at promoting C&#9472;C coupling, thereby bridging microscopic insights and macroscopic applications in the field of CO2 electroreduction.

         <title>Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Quantum Wires and Nanorods</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 23, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on low&#8208;dimensional perovskite materials and discusses their applications in light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). Special attention is given to the introduction of perovskite quantum wires and nanorods, two unique types of one&#8208;dimensional (1D) materials, and their interesting optoelectronic properties. Moreover, the applications of low&#8208;dimensional perovskite materials can extend beyond LEDs to others, such as photodetectors and memristors.








Abstract
Perovskite materials, celebrated for their exceptional optoelectronic properties, have seen extensive application in the field of light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), where research is as abundant as the proverbial &#8220;carloads of books.&#8221; In this review, the research of perovskite materials is delved into from a dimensional perspective, with a focus on the exemplary performance of low&#8208;dimensional perovskite materials in LEDs. This discussion predominantly revolves around perovskite quantum wires and perovskite nanorods. Perovskite quantum wires are versatile in their growth, compatible with both solution&#8208;based and vapor&#8208;phase growth, and can be deposited over large areas&#8212;even on spherical substrates&#8212;to achieve commendable electroluminescence (EL). Perovskite nanorods, on the other hand, boast a suite of superior characteristics, such as polarization properties and tunability of the transition dipole moment, endowing them with the great potential to enhance light extraction efficiency. Furthermore, zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) perovskite materials like nanocrystals (NCs) are also the subject of widespread research and application. This review reflects on and synthesizes the unique qualities of the aforementioned materials while exploring their vital roles in the development of high&#8208;efficiency perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs).

This review addresses gaps in current research, particularly in sound field analysis and energy efficiency optimization. It proposes an energy flow diagram, discusses development stages, and explores the potential advancements in ultrasound&#8208;based healthcare solutions.








Abstract
Implantable medical devices (IMDs), like pacemakers regulating heart rhythm or deep brain stimulators treating neurological disorders, revolutionize healthcare. However, limited battery life necessitates frequent surgeries for replacements. Ultrasound power transfer (UPT) emerges as a promising solution for sustainable IMD operation. Current research prioritizes implantable materials, with less emphasis on sound field analysis and maximizing energy transfer during wireless power delivery. This review addresses this gap. A comprehensive analysis of UPT technology, examining cutting&#8208;edge system designs, particularly in power supply and efficiency is provided. The review critically examines existing efficiency models, summarizing the key parameters influencing energy transmission in UPT systems. For the first time, an energy flow diagram of a general UPT system is proposed to offer insights into the overall functioning. Additionally, the review explores the development stages of UPT technology, showcasing representative designs and applications. The remaining challenges, future directions, and exciting opportunities associated with UPT are discussed. By highlighting the importance of sustainable IMDs with advanced functions like biosensing and closed&#8208;loop drug delivery, as well as UPT's potential, this review aims to inspire further research and advancements in this promising field.

Abstract
Bacteria share a longstanding and complex relationship with humans, playing a role in protecting gut health and sustaining the ecosystem to cause infectious diseases and antibiotic resistance. Luminogenic materials that share aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristics have emerged as a versatile toolbox for bacterial studies through fluorescence visualization. Numerous research efforts highlight the superiority of AIE materials in this field. Recent advances in AIE materials in bacterial studies are categorized into four areas: understanding bacterial interactions, antibacterial strategies, diverse applications, and synergistic applications with bacteria. Initial research focuses on visualizing the unseen bacteria and progresses into developing strategies involving electrostatic interactions, amphiphilic AIE luminogens (AIEgens), and various AIE materials to enhance bacterial affinity. Recent progress in antibacterial strategies includes using photodynamic and photothermal therapies, bacterial toxicity studies, and combined therapies. Diverse applications from environmental disinfection to disease treatment, utilizing AIE materials in antibacterial coatings, bacterial sensors, wound healing materials, etc., are also provided. Finally, synergistic applications combining AIE materials with bacteria to achieve enhanced outcomes are explored. This review summarizes the developmental trend of AIE materials in bacterial studies and is expected to provide future research directions in advancing bacterial methodologies.

         <title>Developing Cathode Films for Practical All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 23, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries offers higher specific energies and lower costs compared to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Li&#8208;ion batteries. However, a lack of mechanistic understanding hinders advancement. This review analyzes key electrode parameters, evaluates progress in enhancing ion/electron percolation, and addresses electrochemical&#8208;mechanical degradation, offering future research directions.








Abstract
The development of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (ASSLSBs) toward large&#8208;scale electrochemical energy storage is driven by the higher specific energies and lower cost in comparison with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Li&#8208;ion batteries. Yet, insufficient mechanistic understanding and quantitative parameters of the key components in sulfur&#8208;based cathode hinders the advancement of the ASSLSB technologies. This review offers a comprehensive analysis of electrode parameters, including specific capacity, voltage, S mass loading and S content toward establishing the specific energy (Wh kg&#8722;1) and energy density (Wh L&#8722;1) of the ASSLSBs. Additionally, this work critically evaluates the progress in enhancing lithium ion and electron percolation and mitigating electrochemical&#8208;mechanical degradation in sulfur&#8208;based cathodes. Last, a critical outlook on potential future research directions is provided to guide the rational design of high&#8208;performance sulfur&#8208;based cathodes toward practical ASSLSBs.

         <title>Materials, Structure, and Interface of Stretchable Interconnects for Wearable Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 23, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stretchable interconnects are one of the fundamental components in achieving robust wearable devices, but their importance is often overlooked. This review highlights their importance and provides insightful information on various materials, configurations, and manufacturing approaches being studied for interconnects. Their practical potentials for wearable bioelectronics are also discussed for future research opportunities.








Abstract
Since wearable technologies for telemedicine have emerged to tackle global health concerns, the demand for well&#8208;attested wearable healthcare devices with high user comfort also arises. Skin&#8208;wearables for health monitoring require mechanical flexibility and stretchability for not only high compatibility with the skin's dynamic nature but also a robust collection of fine health signals from within. Stretchable electrical interconnects, which determine the device's overall integrity, are one of the fundamental units being understated in wearable bioelectronics. In this review, a broad class of materials and engineering methodologies recently researched and developed are presented, and their respective attributes, limitations, and opportunities in designing stretchable interconnects for wearable bioelectronics are offered. Specifically, the electrical and mechanical characteristics of various materials (metals, polymers, carbons, and their composites) are highlighted, along with their compatibility with diverse geometric configurations. Detailed insights into fabrication techniques that are compatible with soft substrates are also provided. Importantly, successful examples of establishing reliable interfacial connections between soft and rigid elements using novel interconnects are reviewed. Lastly, some perspectives and prospects of remaining research challenges and potential pathways for practical utilization of interconnects in wearables are laid out.

         <title>Rational Modulation of Interface Microenvironment and Design of the Flow Electrolyzer for COx Electroreduction to Alcohol</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 23, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the current status of microenvironment regulation of catalytic reaction interface, flow electrolyzers design, and the flow electrolyzers derived stepwise approaches for COxRR to alcohol, aiming to provide new insights into the production of alcohols via COxRR.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic reduction of COx (including CO2 and CO) into value&#8208;added fuels and chemicals, particularly multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) alcohols, presents a significant opportunity to close the manmade carbon cycle and support sustainable energy systems. The catalytic performance of electrochemical reduction reactions of CO2 and CO (COxRR)&#160;is strongly correlated with the local microenvironments, the flow electrolyzer, and the catalysis approaches with flow electrolyzers, which contribute to the kinetic and thermodynamic landscape of the reaction, ultimately determining the efficiency and selectivity of the COxRR toward desired reduction products. However, controllable microenvironment construction, rationally designed flow electrolyzers, and matchable flow electrolyzers derived catalysis approaches chosen for improving COxRR&#8208;to&#8208;alcohol performance still face challenges. Building upon the foundation laid by previous research, this review article will provide an in&#8208;depth summary of the regulation of the catalytic reaction interface microenvironment, the design of flow electrolyzers, and the development of derived stepwise catalysis approaches with the flow electrolyzers, which provide a comprehensive and strategic approach to enhancing the COxRR process for alcohol production, offering valuable insights and innovative solutions that can significantly impact the field of COxRR conversion to alcohol and contribute to the development of more sustainable chemical production methods.

This review comprehensively explores recent advancements in these polymeric materials, while also delving into the remaining challenges and proposing practical design strategies for their future optimization.








Abstract
Inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) hold exceptional promise as next&#8208;generation photovoltaic technology, where both perovskite absorbers and charge&#8208;transporting materials (CTMs) play critical roles in cell performance. In recent years, polymeric CTMs have played an important role in developing efficient, stable, and large&#8208;area inverted PSCs due to their unique properties of high conductivity, tunable structures, and mechanical flexibility. This review provides a comprehensive overview of polymeric CTMs used in inverted PSCs, encompassing polymeric hole transport materials (HTMs) and electron transport materials (ETMs). the relationship between their molecular structures, modification strategies are systematically summarized and analyzed for adjusting energy levels, and improving charge extraction, enabling a deep understanding of these widely used materials. The review also explores effective strategies for designing even more efficient polymeric CTMs. Finally, an outlook is proposed on the exciting research of novel polymeric CTMs, paving the way for their commercialized applications in PSCs.

         <title>Engineering CAR&#8208;T Therapeutics for Enhanced Solid Tumor Targeting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 23, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
CART cell therapy has proven effective for blood cancers but struggles with solid tumors due to diverse antigens and complex environments. Recent efforts focus on improving CAR design and validation platforms. Advances in protein engineering, machine learning, and organoid systems aim to enhance CAR&#8208;T therapy against solid tumors. Some solid tumors, like neuroblastoma, have responded well in trials.








Abstract
Cancer immunotherapy, specifically Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR)&#8208;T cell therapy, represents a significant breakthrough in treating cancers. Despite its success in hematological cancers, CAR&#8208;T exhibits limited efficacy in solid tumors, which account for more than 90% of all cancers. Solid tumors commonly present unique challenges, including antigen heterogeneity and complex tumor microenvironment (TME). To address these, efforts are being made through improvements in CAR design and the development of advanced validation platforms. While efficacy is limited, some solid tumor types, such as neuroblastoma and gastrointestinal cancers, have shown responsiveness to CAR&#8208;T therapy in recent clinical trials. In this review, it is first examined both experimental and computational strategies, such as protein engineering coupled with machine learning, developed to enhance T cell specificity. The challenges and methods associated with T cell delivery and in vivo reprogramming in solid tumors is discussed. It is also explored the advancements in engineered organoid systems, which are emerging as high&#8208;fidelity in vitro models that closely mimic the complex human TME and serve as a validation platform for CAR discovery. Collectively, these innovative engineering strategies offer the potential to revolutionize the next generation of CAR&#8208;T therapy, ultimately paving the way for more effective treatments in solid tumors.

         <title>Fast&#8208;Charging Solid&#8208;State Li Batteries: Materials, Strategies, and Prospects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 23, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review addresses challenges and recent advances in fast&#8208;charging solid&#8208;state batteries, focusing on solid electrolyte and electrode materials, as well as interfacial chemistries. The role of multiscale modeling and simulation in understanding Li+ transport and interfacial phenomena is emphasized, providing insights into materials, strategies, and future prospects for high&#8208;performance, fast&#8208;charging solid&#8208;state batteries.








Abstract
The ability to rapidly charge batteries is crucial for widespread electrification across a number of key sectors, including transportation, grid storage, and portable electronics. Nevertheless, conventional Li&#8208;ion batteries with organic liquid electrolytes face significant technical challenges in achieving rapid charging rates without sacrificing electrochemical efficiency and safety. Solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs) offer intrinsic stability and safety over their liquid counterparts, which can potentially bring exciting opportunities for fast charging applications. Yet realizing fast&#8208;charging SSBs remains challenging due to several fundamental obstacles, including slow Li+ transport within solid electrolytes, sluggish kinetics with the electrodes, poor electrode/electrolyte interfacial contact, as well as the growth of Li dendrites. This article examines fast&#8208;charging SSB challenges through a comprehensive review of materials and strategies for solid electrolytes (ceramics, polymers, and composites), electrodes, and their composites. In particular, methods to enhance ion transport through crystal structure engineering, compositional control, and microstructure optimization are analyzed. The review also addresses interface/interphase chemistry and Li+ transport mechanisms, providing insights to guide material design and interface optimization for next&#8208;generation fast&#8208;charging SSBs.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 23, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes recent advanced catalysts applied in thermal catalysis, microwave&#8208;assisted catalysis, photocatalysis, electrocatalysis, and enzymatic catalysis reaction systems for the chemical recycling of plastic waste into valuable feedstocks.








Abstract
Plastic products bring convenience to various aspects of the daily lives due to their lightweight, durability and versatility, but the massive accumulation of post&#8208;consumer plastic waste is posing significant environmental challenges. Catalytic methods can effectively convert plastic waste into value&#8208;added feedstocks, with catalysts playing an important role in regulating the yield and selectivity of products. This review explores the latest advancements in advanced catalysts applied in thermal catalysis, microwave&#8208;assisted catalysis, photocatalysis, electrocatalysis, and enzymatic catalysis reaction systems for the chemical recycling of plastic waste into valuable feedstocks. Specifically, the pathways and mechanisms involved in the plastics recycling process are analyzed and presented, and the strengths and weaknesses of various catalysts employed across different reaction systems are described. In addition, the structure&#8208;function relationship of these catalysts is discussed. Herein, it is provided insights into the design of novel catalysts applied for the chemical recycling of plastic waste and outline challenges and future opportunities in terms of developing advanced catalysts to tackle the &#8220;white pollution&#8221; crisis.

         <title>Utilizing the Elimination Reaction of Linear Fluorinated Carbonate to Stabilize LiCoO2 Cathode up to 4.6 V</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 23, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating tris(trimethylsilyl)&#8208;based additives, this work addresses the elimination reaction of methyl trifluoroethyl carbonate (FEMC) to contrast a homogeneous robust polymer&#8208;rich cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase. Using the optimized electrolyte, the LiCoO2 cathode can maintain 95% after 500 cycles with a high cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.6 V. This study establishes a foundational framework for employing linear fluorocarbonates in high voltage systems and provides innovative insights into CEI design and construction.








Abstract
Stabilizing LiCoO2 (LCO) cathode at high voltages is still challenging in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Although fluorinated solvents are utilized in high&#8208;voltage systems for their superior oxidation resistance, linear fluorinated carbonates still undergo elimination reactions at high voltages, producing corrosive substances that compromise electrode materials. This study addresses the elimination reaction of methyl trifluoroethyl carbonate (FEMC) by incorporating tris(trimethylsilyl)&#8208;based additives, thereby constructing a homogeneous and robust polymer&#8208;rich cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase (CEI). With the incorporation of tris(trimethylsilyl)phosphite in the optimized electrolyte, the capacity of the coin cell with LCO as the cathode can maintain 95% after 500 cycles with a high cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.6 V. This study establishes a foundational framework for employing linear fluorocarbonates in high&#8208;voltage systems and provides innovative insights into CEI design and construction.

         <title>Integrated Pristine van der Waals Homojunctions for Self&#8208;Powered Image Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 23, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pristine van der Waals homojunctions consisting of 2H&#8208;MoTe2 layers with asymmetric thickness are constructed to eliminate heterogenous interfaces and obtain clean boundaries. The layer&#8208;engineered energy bands of 2H&#8208;MoTe2 layers induce a built&#8208;in electric field at the interface, enabling self&#8208;powered photodetection. Furthermore, a 10 &#215; 10 array based on 2H&#8208;MoTe2 homojunction devices realize zero&#8208;power consumption imaging functions.








Abstract
Van der Waals junctions hold significant potentials for various applications in multifunctional and low&#8208;power electronics and optoelectronics. The multistep device fabrication process usually introduces lattice mismatch and defects at the junction interfaces, which deteriorate device performance. Here the layer engineering synthesis of van der Waals homojunctions consisting of 2H&#8208;MoTe2 with asymmetric thickness to eliminate heterogenous interfaces and thus obtain clean interfaces is reported. Experimental results confirm that the homostructure nature gives rise to the formation of pristine van der Waals junctions, avoiding chemical disorders and defects. The ability to tune the energy bands of 2H&#8208;MoTe2 continuously through layer engineering enables the creation of adjustable built&#8208;in electric field at the homojunction boundaries, which leads to the achievement of self&#8208;powered photodetection based on the obtained 2H&#8208;MoTe2 films. Furthermore, the successful integration of 2H&#8208;MoTe2 homojunctions into an image sensor with 10 &#215; 10 pixels, brings about zero&#8208;power consumption and near&#8208;infrared imaging functions. The pristine van der Waals homojunctions and effective integration strategies shed new insights into the development of large&#8208;scale application for two&#8208;dimensional&#160;materials in advanced electronics and optoelectronics.

         <title>All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries of High Cycling Stability and Rate Capability Enabled by a Self&#8208;Lithiated Sn&#8208;C Interlayer</title>

A self&#8208;lithiated tin (Sn)&#8208;carbon (C)&#160;composite interlayer (LSCI) capable of enhancing electrochemical/structural stability and homogenizing lithium (Li)&#8208;ion transport across the Li/solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) interfaces enables an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8211;sulfur battery (ASSLSBs) with high cycling stability and rate capability.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (ASSLSBs) have attracted intense interest due to their high theoretical energy density and intrinsic safety. However, constructing durable lithium (Li) metal anodes with high cycling efficiency in ASSLSBs remains challenging due to poor interface stability. Here, a compositionally stable, self&#8208;lithiated tin (Sn)&#8208;carbon (C) composite interlayer (LSCI) between Li anode and solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE), capable of homogenizing Li&#8208;ion transport across the interlayer, mitigating decomposition of SSE, and enhancing electrochemical/structural stability of interface, is developed for ASSLSBs. The LSCI&#8208;mediated Li metal anode enables stable Li plating/stripping over 7000&#160;h without Li dendrite penetration. The ASSLSBs equipped with LSCI thus exhibit excellent cycling stability of over 300 cycles (capacity retention of &#8776;80%) under low applied pressure (&lt;8&#160;MPa) and demonstrate improved rate capability even at 3C. The enhanced electrochemical performance and corresponding insights of the designed LSCI broaden the spectrum of advanced interlayers for interface manipulation, advancing the practical application of ASSLSBs.

         <title>Heterogeneous NASICON&#8208;Type Cathode With Reversible Multielectron Reaction for High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 23, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel heterogeneous Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7)/Na2VTi(PO4)3 material achieves high purity and high crystallization by the mutual promotion of intergrowth structures. Benefiting from the interfacial charge redistribution effect between the heterogeneous phases, the electronic conductivity and ion diffusion are greatly improved. The optimized Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7)/Na2VTi(PO4)3 cathode, with a reversible three&#8208;electron redox reaction, exhibits high specific capacity and long cycling life.








Abstract
Na superionic conductor (NASICON)&#8208;structured compounds demonstrate great application potential by their robust framework and compositional diversity. However, they are blamed for the mediocre energy density, and achieving both multielectron reaction and good cycling stability simultaneously is challenging. Herein, a novel heterogeneous Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7)/Na2VTi(PO4)3 (NFPP/NVTP) material with stable multielectron reaction is constructed by spray drying technology. The mutual promotion effect of intergrowth structures effectively improves the purity and the crystallization of NFPP/NVTP during the fabrication process, which is beneficial to the high capacity and cycling stability. As a result, the optimized NFPP/NVTP demonstrates a high reversible capacity of 155.3 mAh g&#8722;1 at 20&#160;mA g&#8722;1 and outstanding cycling stability with 82.9% capacity retention over 2500 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1, which are much superior to those of NFPP and NVTP individually. Even in full cell configuration, the energy density remains high at &#8776;380&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 based on the cathode mass. The high capacity of NFPP/NVTP is also attributed to the successive reduction/oxidation mechanism involving the introduction of Ti3+ and interfacial charge redistribution effect between the heterogeneous phases, which greatly improve the electronic and ionic conductivity. Moreover, high reversible structural evolution during the multisodium storage process further guarantees excellent cycling stability.

         <title>Molecular Control of the Donor/Acceptor Interface Suppresses Charge Recombination Enabling High&#8208;Efficiency Single&#8208;Component Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 23, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The outstanding double&#8208;cable&#8208;based single&#8208;component material, DCPY2, exhibits a suppressed charge recombination process alongside efficient charge generation. This results in a high fill factor and short&#8208;circuit current, yielding an efficiency to 13.85%. The slow recombination process in DCPY2 compared to binary systems is attributed to the reduced wavefunction overlap between donor and acceptor from inherent alkyl linker and enhanced acceptor aggregation.








Abstract
Single&#8208;component organic solar cells based on double cable polymers have achieved remarkable performance, with DCPY2 reaching a high efficiency of over 13%. In this study, DCPY2 is further optimized with an efficiency of 13.85%, maintaining a high fill factor (FF) without compromising the short circuit current. Despite its intermixed morphology, DCPY2 shows a reduced recombination rate compared to their binary counterpart (PBDB&#8208;T:Y&#8208;O6). This slower recombination in DCPY2 is attributed to the reduced wavefunction overlap of delocalized charges, achieved by spatially separating the donor and acceptor units with an alkyl linker, thereby restricting the recombination pathways. Adding 1,8&#8208;diiodooctane (DIO) into DCPY2 further reduced the recombination rate by facilitating acceptor aggregation, allowing free charges to become more delocalized. The DIO&#8208;assisted aggregation in DCPY2 (5% DIO) is evidenced by an increased pseudo&#8208;pure domain size of Y&#8208;O6. Fine molecular control at the donor/acceptor interface in the double&#8208;cable polymer achieves reduced non&#8208;geminate recombination under efficient charge generation, increased mobility, and charge carrier lifetime, thereby achieving superior performance. Nevertheless, the FF is still limited by relatively low mobility compared to the blend, suggesting the potential for further mobility improvement through enhanced higher&#8208;dimensional packing of the double&#8208;cable material.

         <title>Clickable, Thermally Responsive Hydrogels Enabled by Recombinant Spider Silk Protein and Spy Chemistry for Sustained Neurotrophin Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 23, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An injectable hydrogel comprising recombinant spider silk proteins is formed through ultrasound and thermally induced phase transition. Thanks to SpyTag/SpyCatcher chemistry, neurotrophins such as CNTF are covalently immobilized onto the hydrogels, enabling sustained protein delivery, prolonged neuroprotection, and enhanced axon regrowth following optic nerve injury. This system serves as a safe and versatile platform for the delivery of therapeutic proteins.









Abstract
The ability to deliver protein therapeutics in a minimally invasive, safe, and sustained manner, without resorting to viral delivery systems, will be crucial for treating a wide range of chronic injuries and diseases. Among these challenges, achieving axon regeneration and functional recovery post&#8208;injury or disease in the central nervous system remains elusive to most clinical interventions, constantly calling for innovative solutions. Here, a thermally responsive hydrogel system utilizing recombinant spider silk protein (spidroin) is developed. The protein solution undergoes rapid sol&#8208;gel transition at an elevated temperature (37&#160;&#176;C) following brief sonication. This thermally triggered gelation confers injectability to the system. Leveraging SpyTag/SpyCatcher chemistry, the hydrogel, composed of SpyTag&#8208;fusion spidroin, can be functionalized with diverse SpyCatcher&#8208;fusion bioactive motifs, such as neurotrophic factors (e.g., ciliary neurotrophic factor) and cell&#8208;binding ligands (e.g., laminin), rendering it well&#8208;suited for neuronal culturing. More importantly, the intravitreous injection of the protein materials decorated with SpyCatcher&#8208;fusion CNTF into the vitreous body after optic nerve injury leads to prolonged JAK/STAT3 signaling, increased neuronal survival, and enhanced axon regeneration. This study illustrates a generalizable material system for injectable and sustained delivery of protein therapeutics for neuroprotection and regeneration, with the potential for extension to other chronic diseases and injuries.

         <title>Perspectives on Devices for Integrated Phononic Circuits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 23, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phononic devices offer unique advantages in RF applications due to their shorter wavelengths compared to photons. This perspective explores functional phononic devices that can enable integrated phononic circuits. These circuits promise to enable miniaturized communication systems with improved SWaP&#8208;C characteristics, while also finding applications in quantum information science, sensing, and biomedical engineering.








Abstract
The phonon wavelength, being much shorter than that of photons at the same frequency, offers phononic devices a unique niche in radio frequency (RF)&#160;applications. However, the current limitations of these devices, particularly their restricted functionality, hinder their broader integration and application. Currently, many functions are achieved using alternative signal forms like electric and photonic signals, requiring bulky converters to transform between phonon signals and other forms. The development of functional phononic devices paves the way for integrated phononic circuits, which aim to minimize the need for signal conversion while accomplishing all necessary functions. In this perspective, a brief overview of several types of functional phononic devices is provided that hold promise for integration, such as phononic modulators, amplifiers, lasers, nonreciprocal devices, and those inspired by topological physics. It is envisioned that through continued developments in materials, fabrication techniques, and designs, it's possible to realize integrated phononic circuits which will be applied in miniaturized communication devices with reduced size, weight, power consumption, and cost (SWaP&#8208;C), as well as in other fields including quantum information science, sensing, biomedical engineering, and beyond.

         <title>Optoelectronic Devices for In&#8208;Sensor Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 23, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The raw data obtained directly from sensors in the noisy analogue domain is often unstructured, which lacks a predefined format or organization and does not conform to a specific data model. Optoelectronic devices for in&#8208;sensor visual processing can integrate perception, memory, and processing functions in the same physical units, which can compress and structure vision without extra optoelectronic conversion.








Abstract
The demand for accurate perception of the physical world leads to a dramatic increase in sensory nodes. However, the transmission of massive and unstructured sensory data from sensors to computing units poses great challenges in terms of power&#8208;efficiency, transmission bandwidth, data storage, time latency, and security. To efficiently process massive sensory data, it is crucial to achieve data compression and structuring at the sensory terminals. In&#8208;sensor computing integrates perception, memory, and processing functions within sensors, enabling sensory terminals to perform data compression and data structuring. Here, vision sensors are adopted as an example and discuss the functions of electronic, optical, and optoelectronic hardware for visual processing. Particularly, hardware implementations of optoelectronic devices for in&#8208;sensor visual processing that can compress and structure multidimensional vision information are examined. The underlying resistive switching mechanisms of volatile/nonvolatile optoelectronic devices and their processing operations are explored. Finally, a perspective on the future development of optoelectronic devices for in&#8208;sensor computing is provided.

         <title>Mastering Proton Activities in Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 23, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advanced aqueous batteries are promising alternatives for grid energy storage. Understanding and mastering the proton activities in aqueous electrolytes will guide the design of sustainable and long&#8208;lasting aqueous batteries. This Perspective comments on the current understanding of the thermodynamic and kinetic perspectives of proton activities and highlights future research directions for aqueous batteries.








Abstract
Advanced aqueous batteries are promising solutions for grid energy storage. Compared with their organic counterparts, water&#8208;based electrolytes enable fast transport kinetics, high safety, low cost, and enhanced environmental sustainability. However, the presence of protons in the electrolyte, generated by the spontaneous ionization of water, may compete with the main charge&#8208;storage mechanism, trigger unwanted side reactions, and accelerate the deterioration of the cell performance. Therefore, it is of pivotal importance to understand and master the proton activities in aqueous batteries. This Perspective comments&#160;on the following scientific questions: Why are proton activities relevant? What are proton activities? What do&#160;we&#160;know about proton activities in aqueous batteries? How do&#160;we&#160;better understand, control, and utilize proton activities?

The defect chemistry is focused on governing high&#8208;voltage cathode materials for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

Abstract
High&#8208;voltage cathodes (HVCs) have emerged as a paramount role for the next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, the pursuit of HVCs comes with inherent challenges related to defective structures, which significantly impact the electrochemical performance of LIBs. The current obstacle lies in the lack of a comprehensive understanding of defects and their precise effects. This perspective aims to provide insights into defect chemistry for governing HVCs. The classifications, formation mechanisms, and evolution of defects are outlined to explore the intricate relationship between defects and electrochemical behavior. The pressing need for cutting&#8208;edge characterization techniques that comprehensively investigate defects across various temporal and spatial scales is emphasized. Building on these fundamental understandings, engineering strategies such as composition tailoring, morphology design, interface modification, and structural control to mitigate or utilize defects are thoroughly discussed for enhanced HVCs performance. These insights are expected to provide vital guidelines for developing high&#8208;performance HVCs for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

In article number 2418464, Luiz G. Greca, Gustav Nystr&#246;m, and co&#8208;workers present a new sustainable materials technology where living fiber dispersions is achieved by combining liquid fermentation in industrial bioreactors with traditional fiber processing techniques. The living fungi fibers can form dynamic materials, capable of self&#8208;crosslinking, stabilizing emulsions, proximity sensing, tuning hydrophobicity, and actively degrading lignocellulosic waste. This scalable technology is envisioned to expand the horizons for sustainable materials manufacturing.

         <title>Data Readout Techniques for DNA&#8208;Based Information Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
As a universal genetic material, DNA can inherently encode and transmit information. Various DNA data storage systems are reported as attractive alternatives to current digital data storage media. This review provides a detailed analysis of the characteristics and evolution of readout techniques of DNA storage systems, and discusses challenges and opportunities in readout techniques of DNA data storage systems.








Abstract
DNA is a natural chemical substrate that carries genetic information, which also serves as a powerful toolkit for storing digital data. Compared to traditional&#160;storage media, DNA molecules offer higher storage density, longer lifespan, and lower maintenance energy consumption. In DNA storage process, data readout is a critical step that bridges the gap between DNA molecular/structures with stored digital information. With the continued development of strategies in DNA data storage technology, the readout techniques have evolved. However, there is a lack of systematic introduction and discussion on the readout techniques for reported DNA data storage systems, especially the correlation between the design of the data storage system and the corresponding selection of readout techniques. This review first introduces two main categories of DNA data storage units (i.e., sequence and structure) and their corresponding readout techniques (i.e., sequencing and nonsequencing methods), and then reviewed representative examples of notable advancements in DNA data storage technology, focusing on data storage unit design, and readout technique selection. It also introduces emerging approaches to assist data readout techniques, such as implementation of microfluidic and fluorescent probes. Finally, the paper discusses the limitations, challenges, and potential of DNA data readout approaches.

This review provides a holistic overview of biopolymers&#8208;derived electronic skins (Bp&#8208;E&#8208;Skins), highlighting their exceptional attributes, nature&#8208;inspired engineering constructions, promising applications, and remaining fundamental and technical challenges. These insights provide a design framework to provoke the advancement of e&#8208;skins with high adaptivity, mechanical robustness, and sustainability that contribute to the development of high&#8208;performance wearable electronic systems.








Abstract
The past few years have witnessed the rapid exploration of natural and synthetic materials to construct electronic skins (e&#8208;skins) to emulate the multisensory functions of human skins driven by promising applications. Among various materials employed in functional e&#8208;skins, biopolymers are particularly notable for their exceptional biocompatibility and abundant resources. Despite remarkable progress in engineering biopolymeric materials, a timely and holistic review focusing on the design, synthesis, and modification of biopolymers tailored for biopolymers&#8208;derived e&#8208;skins (Bp&#8208;E&#8208;Skins) is lacking. In this review, the key attributes of biopolymers are introduced&#160;to establish a fundamental understanding fordeveloping functional Bp&#8208;E&#8208;Skins. Next, the recent progress in harnessing various natural and synthetic biopolymers as building blocks for constructing Bp&#8208;E&#8208;Skins is systematically discussed, providing insights into maximizing the distinctive attributes of biopolymers. Subsequently, the benefits of nature&#8208;inspired Bp&#8208;E&#8208;Skins achieved through heterogeneous composite and structural engineering are highlighted, infusing fresh momentum into the advancement of e&#8208;skins. Then, the promising applications of Bp&#8208;E&#8208;Skins in multisensory functions are summarized, including both local monitoring and remote teleoperation, as well as sustainable energy harvesting that empowers e&#8208;skins. Finally, the remaining fundamental and technical challenges in advancing Bp&#8208;E&#8208;Skins are presented to provoke future designs that emulate and even go beyond human skins.

         <title>Functional Biomaterials Derived from Protein Liquid&#8211;Liquid Phase Separation and Liquid&#8208;to&#8208;Solid Transition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein can undergo liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation and liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transition to form liquid condensates and solid aggregates. These phase transitions can be influenced by post&#8208;translational modifications, mutations, and various environmental factors. Effective modulation of protein phase behavior offers promising applications in drug discovery, delivery, and fabrication of multifunctional protein&#8208;based liquid and solid materials.








Abstract
Protein phase transitions play a vital role in both cellular functions and pathogenesis. Dispersed proteins can undergo liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation to form condensates, a process that is reversible and highly regulated within cells. The formation and physicochemical properties of these condensates, such as composition, viscosity, and multiphase miscibility, are precisely modulated to fulfill specific biological functions. However, protein condensates can undergo a further liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid state, forming &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;rich aggregates that may disrupt cellular function and lead to diseases. While this phenomenon is crucial for biological processes and has significant implications for neurodegenerative diseases, the phase behavior of naturally derived or engineered proteins and polypeptides also presents opportunities for developing high&#8208;performance, multifunctional materials at various scales. Additionally, the unique molecular recruitment capabilities of condensates inspire innovative advancements in biomaterial design for applications in drug discovery, delivery, and biosynthesis. This work highlights recent progress in understanding the mechanisms underlying protein phase behavior, particularly how it responds to internal molecular changes and external physical stimuli. Furthermore, the fabrication of multifunctional materials derived from diverse protein sources through controlled phase transitions is demonstrated.

         <title>Artificial Intelligence and Multiscale Modeling for Sustainable Biopolymers and Bioinspired Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores the multiscale architectures and functional mechanisms of biopolymers and bioinspired materials, from hierarchical structures to AI&#8208;powered methodologies. It covers sustainable configurations, multiscale modeling techniques, and AI applications for enhancing functionality, biodegradability, and design. The work concludes with a forward&#8208;looking perspective on biopolymer advancements and potential for broad lifecycle impacts in advanced material manufacturing.








Abstract
Biopolymers and bioinspired materials contribute to the construction of intricate hierarchical structures that exhibit advanced properties. The remarkable toughness and damage tolerance of such multilevel materials are conferred through the hierarchical assembly of their multiscale (i.e., atomistic to macroscale) components and architectures. Here, the functionality and mechanisms of biopolymers and bio&#8208;inspired materials at multilength scales are explored and summarized, focusing on biopolymer nanofibril configurations, biocompatible synthetic biopolymers, and bio&#8208;inspired composites. Their modeling methods with theoretical basis at multiple lengths and time scales are reviewed for biopolymer applications. Additionally, the exploration of artificial intelligence&#8208;powered methodologies is emphasized to realize improvements in these biopolymers from functionality, biodegradability, and sustainability to their characterization, fabrication process, and superior designs. Ultimately, a promising future for these versatile materials in the manufacturing of advanced materials across wider applications and greater lifecycle impacts is foreseen.

         <title>Autonomous Bioelectronic Devices Based on Silk Fibroin</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights the unique autonomous features of silk fibroin (SF), including self&#8208;healing, shape&#8208;morphing, and biodegradability, which enable its integration into bioelectronics. Key applications such as smart textiles, epidermal sensors, and adaptable implants are explored. The discussion addresses challenges in scalability, reproducibility, and bio&#8208;integration while presenting future directions for sustainable and multifunctional silk&#8208;based technologies.








Abstract
The development of autonomous bioelectronic devices capable of dynamically adapting to changing biological environments represents a significant advancement in healthcare and wearable technologies. Such systems draw inspiration from the precision, adaptability, and self&#8208;regulation of biological processes, requiring materials with intrinsic versatility and seamless bio&#8208;integration to ensure biocompatibility and functionality over time. Silk fibroin (SF) derived from Bombyx mori cocoons, has emerged as an ideal biomaterial with a unique combination of biocompatibility, mechanical flexibility, and tunable biodegradability. Adding autonomous features into SF, including self&#8208;healing, shape&#8208;morphing, and controllable degradation, enables dynamic interactions with living tissues while minimizing immune responses and mechanical mismatches. Additionally, structural tunability and environmental sustainability of SF further reinforce its potential as a platform for adaptive implants, epidermal electronics, and intelligent textiles. This review explores recent progress in understanding the structure&#8211;property relationships of SF, its modification strategies, and its great potential for integration into advanced autonomous bioelectronic systems while addressing challenges related to scalability, reproducibility, and multifunctionality. Future opportunities, such as AI&#8208;assisted material design, scalable fabrication techniques, and the incorporation of wireless and personalized technologies, are also discussed, positioning SF as a key material in bridging the gap between biological systems and artificial technologies.

         <title>Designing for Degradation: Transient Devices Enabled by (Nano)Cellulose</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent progress in transient devices enabled by (nano)cellulosic materials is reviewed. Transiency mechanisms, advantages of nanocelluloses, and a suite of applications are discussed. A circular thinking approach coupled with life cycle assessment is applied to critically revisit the potential, advantages, and challenges of nanocellulose&#8208;enabled transient devices for future materials innovation.








Abstract
Transient technology involves materials and devices that undergo controlled degradation after a reliable operation period. This groundbreaking strategy offers significant advantages over conventional devices based on non&#8208;renewable materials by limiting environmental exposure to potentially hazardous components after disposal, and by increasing material circularity. As the most abundant naturally occurring polymer on Earth, cellulose is an attractive material for this purpose. Besides, (nano)celluloses are inherently biodegradable and have competitive mechanical, optical, thermal, and ionic conductivity properties that can be exploited to develop sustainable devices and avoid the end&#8208;of&#8208;life issues associated with conventional systems. Despite its potential, few efforts have been made to review current advances in cellulose&#8208;based transient technology. Therefore, this review catalogs the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art developments in transient devices enabled by cellulosic materials. To provide a wide perspective, the various degradation mechanisms involved in cellulosic transient devices are introduced. The advanced capabilities of transient cellulosic systems in sensing, photonics, energy storage, electronics, and biomedicine are also highlighted. Current bottlenecks toward successful implementation are discussed, with material circularity and environmental impact metrics at the center. It is believed that this review will serve as a valuable resource for the proliferation of cellulose&#8208;based transient technology and its implementation into fully integrated, circular, and environmentally sustainable devices.

Abstract
Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) play a crucial role in attaining sustainable energy for various wearable devices. Polymer materials are essential components of TENGs. Biopolymers are suitable materials for TENGs because of their degradability, natural sourcing, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. Herein, the latest progress in commonly used biopolymers and well&#8208;designed biomimetic techniques for TENG is summarized. The applications of natural rubber, polysaccharides, protein&#8208;based biopolymers, and other common synthetic biopolymers in TENG technology are summarized in detail. Each biopolymer is discussed based on its electrification capability, polarity variations, and specific functionalities as active and functional layers of TENGs. Important biomimetic strategies and related applications of specific biopolymers are also summarized to guide the structural and functional design of TENG. In the future, the study of triboelectric biopolymers may focus on exploring alternative candidates, enhancing charge density, and expanding functionality. Various possible applications of biopolymer&#8208;based TENGs are proposed in this review. By applying biopolymers and related biomimetic methods to TENG devices, the applications of TENG in the fields of healthcare, environmental monitoring, and wearable/implantable electronics can be further promoted.

This review covers the basic structural variety of PLA, current states of stereocontrolled synthesis as well as the relationships between the structures and properties. Moreover, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art examples of high&#8208;performance PLA&#8208;based materials within an array of applications (packaging, fibers textiles, biomedicine, healthcare, and electronic devices) are highlighted.








Abstract
Poly(lactic acid) (PLA) is a representative biobased and biodegradable aliphatic polyester and a front&#8208;runner among sustainable materials. As a semicrystalline thermoplastic, PLA exhibits excellent mechanical and physical properties, attracting considerable attention in commodity and medical fields. Stereochemistry is a key factor affecting PLA's properties, and to this end, the engineering of PLA's microstructure for tailored material properties has been an active area of research over the decade. This Review first covers the basic structural variety of PLA. A perspective on the current states of stereocontrolled synthesis as well as the relationships between the structures and properties of PLA stereosequences are included, with an emphasis on record regularity and properties. At last, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art examples of high&#8208;performance PLA&#8208;based materials within an array of applications are given, including packaging, fibers, and textiles, healthcare and electronic devices. Among various stereo&#8208;regular sequences of PLA, poly(L&#8208;lactic acid) (PLLA) is the most prominent category and has myriad unique properties and applications. In this regard, cutting&#8208;edge applications of PLLA are mainly overviewed in this review. At the same time, new materials developed based on other PLA stereosequences are highlighted, which holds the potential to a wide variety of PLA&#8208;based sustainable materials.

Cellulose&#8208;templated nanomaterials enable the delicate nano&#8208;/microscale structural construction. This review aims to present cellulose&#8208;templated nanomaterials for the developments in the field of nanogenerators and self&#8208;powered sensors, through introducing various cellulose&#8208;templated nanomaterials including template and guest materials, following a detailed analysis on related fashionable applications of nanogenerators and self&#8208;powered sensors in cellulose&#8208;templated nanomaterials.








Abstract
Energy crisis inspires the development of renewable and clean energy sources, along with related applications such as nanogenerators and self&#8208;powered devices. Balancing high performance and environmental sustainability in advanced material innovation is a challenging task. Addressing the global challenges of sustainable development and carbon neutrality lead to increased&#160;interest in biopolymer research. Nanocellulose materials, derived from biopolymers, demonstrate potential as template candidates for advanced materials, due to their unique properties, including high strength, high surface area, controllable pore structures and high&#8208;water retention. In recent years, cellulose&#8208;templated nanomaterials enable delicate nano&#8208;/microscale structural construction, thus promoting developments in the field of nanogenerators and self&#8208;powered sensors. However, there is still a limited number of reviews focused on cellulose&#8208;templated nanomaterials for applications in nanogenerators and self&#8208;powered sensors. This review aims to fill this research gap by introducing various cellulose&#8208;templated nanomaterials and providing a detailed analysis of their fashionable applications in nanogenerators and self&#8208;powered sensors. The goal is to present cellulose&#8208;templated nanomaterials as highly promising template and guest materials for templating technologies, offering sustainable nano&#8208;/microscale control over advanced materials for the foreseeable future. This potential is promising for new applications in the fields of nanogenerators and self&#8208;powered sensors.

Nanocellulose materials, derived from biopolymers, demonstrate potential as template candidates for advanced materials, due to their unique properties, including high strength, high surface area, controllable pore structures and high-water retention. In recent years, cellulose-templated nanomaterials enable delicate nano-/microscale structural construction, thus promoting developments in the field of nanogenerators and self-powered sensors. However, there is still a limited number of reviews focused on cellulose-templated nanomaterials for applications in nanogenerators and self-powered sensors. This review aims to fill this research gap by introducing various cellulose-templated nanomaterials and providing a detailed analysis of their fashionable applications in nanogenerators and self-powered sensors. The goal is to present cellulose-templated nanomaterials as highly promising template and guest materials for templating technologies, offering sustainable nano-/microscale control over advanced materials for the foreseeable future. This potential is promising for new applications in the fields of nanogenerators and self-powered sensors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Biopolymers, recognized for their abundance, cost&#8208;effectiveness, biodegradability, tunable structures, and adjustable properties, offer a compelling solution to these challenges. This review systematically and comprehensively examines biopolymers and their protective mechanisms for Li and Zn metal anodes. It begins with an overview of biopolymers, detailing key types, their structures, and properties. The review then explores recent advancements in the application of biopolymers as artificial solid electrolyte interphases, electrolyte additives, separators, and solid&#8208;state electrolytes, emphasizing how their structural properties enhance protection mechanisms and improve electrochemical performance. Finally, perspectives on current challenges and future research directions in this evolving field are provided.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cellulose nanofiber (CNF) has unique intrinsic physical properties, showing great potential for constructing sustainable materials. This review introduces emerging CNF&#8208;based structural materials, including challenges in their assembly process and their exceptional mechanical and thermal properties. Based on the structural designability and functionalization characteristics of CNF&#8208;based structural materials, the potential applications and future trends are discussed.








Abstract
Under the guidance of the carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals, the urgency for green ecological construction and the depletion of nonrenewable resources highlight the importance of the research and development of sustainable new materials. Cellulose nanofiber (CNF) is the most abundant natural nanoscale building block widely existing on Earth. CNF has unique intrinsic physical properties, such as low density, low coefficient of thermal expansion, high strength, and high modulus, which is an ideal candidate with outstanding potential for constructing sustainable materials. In recent years, CNF&#8208;based structural material has emerged as a sustainable lightweight material with properties very different from traditional structural materials. Here, to comprehensively introduce the assembly of structural materials based on CNF, it starts with an overview of different forms of CNF&#8208;based materials, including fibers, films, hydrogels, aerogels, and structural materials. Next, the challenges that need to be overcome in preparing CNF&#8208;based structural materials are discussed, their assembly methods are introduced, and an in&#8208;depth analysis of the advantages of the CNF&#8208;based hydrogel assembly strategy to fabricate structural materials is conducted. Finally, the unique properties of emerging CNF&#8208;based structural materials are summarized and concluded with an outlook on their design and functionalization, potentially paving the way toward new opportunities.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wearable electronics utilizing advanced carbon materials from fossil origins face issues like non&#8208;renewability, high energy consumption, and greenhouse gas emissions. Biopolymers present a sustainable alternative for carbon&#8208;based wearables. This review highlights the carbonization of key biopolymers&#8212;cellulose, lignin, chitin, and silk fibroin&#8212;discussing mechanisms, techniques, and applications of biopolymer&#8208;derived carbon materials in wearable technology.








Abstract
Advanced carbon materials are widely utilized in wearable electronics. Nevertheless, the production of carbon materials from fossil&#8208;based sources raised concerns regarding their non&#8208;renewability, high energy consumption, and the consequent greenhouse gas emissions. Biopolymers, readily available in nature, offer a promising and eco&#8208;friendly alternative as a carbon source, enabling the sustainable production of carbon materials for wearable electronics. This review aims to discuss the carbonization mechanisms, carbonization techniques, and processes, as well as the diverse applications of biopolymer&#8208;derived carbon materials (BioCMs) in wearable electronics. First, the characteristics of four representative biopolymers, including cellulose, lignin, chitin, and silk fibroin, and their carbonization processes are discussed. Then, typical carbonization techniques, including pyrolysis carbonization, laser&#8208;induced carbonization, Joule heating carbonization, hydrothermal transformation, and salt encapsulation carbonization are discussed. The influence of the processes on the morphology and properties of the resultant BioCMs are summarized. Subsequently, applications of BioCMs in wearable devices, including physical sensors, chemical sensors, energy devices, and display devices are discussed. Finally, the challenges currently facing the field and the future opportunities are discussed.

         <title>Biopolymer&#8208;Based Flame Retardants and Flame&#8208;Retardant Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents recent advancements in producing sustainable flame&#8208;retardant materials using biopolymers as additive agents, functional coatings, and structural matrices. The focus is on advanced applications for lithium&#8208;ion batteries, thermal insulation, and fire warning devices. Most of these applications utilize biopolymers derived from non&#8208;food sources such as cellulose, lignin, chitosan, and alginates obtained from plants and marine organisms.








Abstract
Polymeric materials featuring excellent flame retardancy are essential for applications requiring high levels of fire safety, while those based on biopolymers are highly favored due to their eco&#8208;friendly nature, sustainable characteristics, and abundant availability. This review first outlines the pyrolysis behaviors of biopolymers, with particular emphasis on naturally occurring ones derived from non&#8208;food sources such as cellulose, chitin/chitosan, alginate, and lignin. Then, the strategies for chemical modifications of biopolymers for flame&#8208;retardant purposes through covalent, ionic, and coordination bonds are presented and compared. The emphasis is placed on advanced methods for introducing biopolymer&#8208;based flame retardants into polymeric matrices and fabricating biopolymer&#8208;based flame&#8208;retardant materials. Finally, the challenges for sustaining the current momentum in the utilization of biopolymers for flame&#8208;retardant purposes are further discussed.

         <title>Hierarchical Engineering for Biopolymer&#8208;based Hydrogels with Tailored Property and Functionality</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, key strategies for designing biopolymer&#8208;based hydrogels from the molecular to the macroscopic scale are summarized. Emphasis is placed on how molecular architecture, processing methods, and fabrication technologies converge to yield materials with tunable mechanical properties, dynamic responsiveness, and enhanced transport behaviors for diverse biomedical and technological applications. The unified approach guides future hydrogel developments.









Abstract
Biopolymer&#8208;based hydrogels offer versatility in biomedical engineering due to their abundance, biocompatibility, tailorable properties, and environmental responsiveness. Realizing their full potential requires understanding the molecular&#8208;level design principles that govern their macroscopic behavior. This review analyzes recent advances in the molecular engineering of biopolymer&#8208;based hydrogels, emphasizing innovative network design strategies and processing methods for precise control over material properties and functions. How molecular design influences hydrogel behavior across multiple length scales are explored, focusing on: 1) network design strategies: approaches like double networks, interpenetrating networks, and supramolecular assemblies to tailor mechanical and responsive properties; 2) processing techniques: methods such as Hofmeister effect&#8208;induced chain aggregating, cononsolvency&#8208;based porous structure controlling, and directional freezing&#8208;induced network alignment to achieve hierarchical and anisotropic structures. How these design principles and processing methods influence critical hydrogel properties like mechanical strength, inner mass transportation, and degradation are discussed. The review also covers advanced fabrication techniques that leverage these molecular engineering approaches to create complex, functional hydrogels. By elucidating the relationships between molecular architecture, processing methods, and resulting material properties, this work aims to provide a framework for designing next&#8208;generation biopolymer&#8208;based hydrogels with enhanced performance and functionality across various applications.

         <title>An Implantable and Degradable Silk Sericin Protein Film Energy Harvester for Next&#8208;Generation Cardiovascular Electronic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A piezoelectric film is created using structural engineered silk sericin, presenting satisfactory output performance, biocompatibility, and biodegradability. This piezoelectric film&#8208;based energy&#8208;harvester can illuminate LED or operate a portable electronic device through converting mechanical energy into electrical energy. It holds promise as a power source for delivering effective electrical stimulation to restore cardiac activity in asystole or normalize an AV block.








Abstract
Current cardiovascular implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) face a pressing clinical need for the development of battery&#8208;free, biodegradable, and biocompatible devices to mitigate the risk of adverse in vivo responses. To address this demand, it is proposed utilizing a natural biomaterial, silk sericin (SS), which exhibits valuable biological activities and contains abundant asymmetric amino acids with adjustable structures, to create an implantable self&#8208;powered system based on the piezoelectric principle. The functionalized SS&#8208;based (F&#8208;SS&#8208;based) piezoelectric film demonstrates a high longitudinal piezoelectric tensor (d33) of 12&#160;pC&#160;N&#8722;1. An energy&#8208;generating device (EG device) utilizing this piezoelectric film can generate electric energy under mechanical force both in vitro and in vivo. By manually tapping the EG&#8208;device for a few minutes, the accumulated electricity in a commercial capacitor (1.1&#160;&#181;F) could illuminate LEDs or operate a timer. Furthermore, the instantaneous energy power density (218.5&#160;&#181;W&#160;m&#8722;2) achieved by manual pressing the EG device is sufficient to deliver effective pacing to restart a non&#8208;beating heart or normalize an atrioventricular block in a preclinical model. Owing to its high biocompatibility and biodegradability in physiological environments, the F&#8208;SS&#8208;based EG device holds significant promise for the advancement of self&#8208;powered power systems for next&#8208;generation CIEDs and other implantable and degradable electronic devices.

     alt="An Implantable and Degradable Silk Sericin Protein Film Energy Harvester for Next-Generation Cardiovascular Electronic Devices"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A piezoelectric film is created using structural engineered silk sericin, presenting satisfactory output performance, biocompatibility, and biodegradability. This piezoelectric film-based energy-harvester can illuminate LED or operate a portable electronic device through converting mechanical energy into electrical energy. It holds promise as a power source for delivering effective electrical stimulation to restore cardiac activity in asystole or normalize an AV block.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current cardiovascular implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) face a pressing clinical need for the development of battery-free, biodegradable, and biocompatible devices to mitigate the risk of adverse in vivo responses. To address this demand, it is proposed utilizing a natural biomaterial, silk sericin (SS), which exhibits valuable biological activities and contains abundant asymmetric amino acids with adjustable structures, to create an implantable self-powered system based on the piezoelectric principle. The functionalized SS-based (F-SS-based) piezoelectric film demonstrates a high longitudinal piezoelectric tensor (&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;33&lt;/sub&gt;) of 12&#160;pC&#160;N&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. An energy-generating device (EG device) utilizing this piezoelectric film can generate electric energy under mechanical force both in vitro and in vivo. By manually tapping the EG-device for a few minutes, the accumulated electricity in a commercial capacitor (1.1&#160;&#181;F) could illuminate LEDs or operate a timer. Furthermore, the instantaneous energy power density (218.5&#160;&#181;W&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) achieved by manual pressing the EG device is sufficient to deliver effective pacing to restart a non-beating heart or normalize an atrioventricular block in a preclinical model. Owing to its high biocompatibility and biodegradability in physiological environments, the F-SS-based EG device holds significant promise for the advancement of self-powered power systems for next-generation CIEDs and other implantable and degradable electronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biopolymeric Ionotronics Based on Biodegradable Wool Keratin</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pH&#8208;responsive wool keratin serves as the sole biopolymer matrix for the fabrication of high&#8208;performance ionotronic devices, without the use of toxic chemicals, complex synthesis, or grafting processes. Furthermore, the innate biodegradability of wool keratin makes it an environmentally friendly option, furthering the advancement of sustainable devices based on natural polymers.








Abstract
The advent of ionotronics has revealed significant potential in flexible transistors, energy harvesting, and unconventional circuits. However, most ionotronic devices, often centered around synthetic polymers, involve complex grafting or synthesis that raise legitimate concerns about their environmental sustainability. Herein, a simple yet versatile approach for developing single&#8208;composition ionotronic devices using wool keratin (WK), a biodegradable and pH&#8208;responsive natural polymer is presented. By employing facile pH regulation processes, WK molecules with opposing polarities are successfully modified, which are combined to form an ionic heterojunction through entropically driven depletion. This ionic heterojunction functions as an ionic diode, enabling efficient rectification of alternating current signals (with a rectification ratio of up to 199). Furthermore, the application of this biopolymeric ionotronic device is extended to mechanical energy harvesting, self&#8208;powered sensing, and ionic logic circuit. The biodegradability and renewability of WK offer a viable alternative to synthetic materials, highlighting its potential for sustainable applications.

         <title>Expanded Nanofibrous Cellulose Electrode Binder: Declustering Lithium Polysulfides for Lean&#8208;Electrolyte Li&#8210;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>

2,2,6,6&#8208;Tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl radical (TEMPO)&#8208;oxidized cellulose nanofiber (TOCN) is presented as a class of expanded nanofibrous electrode binders for lean&#8208;electrolyte lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries. Owing to the increased active sites for intermolecular interaction with Li polysulfides (LiPS), the TOCN binder promotes the declustering of LiPS, thereby achieving a high cell&#8208;level energy density of 503 Wh kg&#8722;1 at a low electrolyte&#8208;to&#8208;sulfur ratio of 2.0 &#181;L mgsulfur&#8722;1.








Abstract
Despite their potential as an alternative to commercial lithium (Li)&#8210;ion batteries, Li&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries face challenges related to energy density limitations caused by the considerable amount of electrolyte required. Lean electrolytes have proven effective in mitigating this issue. However, they tend to exacerbate Li polysulfides (LiPS) clustering, resulting in incomplete S utilization and sluggish conversion kinetics. Here, 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl radical (TEMPO)&#8208;oxidized cellulose nanofiber (TOCN) is presented as an expanded nanofibrous electrode binder for lean&#8208;electrolyte Li&#8210;S batteries. Owing to its 1D fibrous structure and expanded inter&#8208;glucose chain distance, the TOCN binder offers more accessible active sites for intermolecular interactions with LiPS. Consequently, LiPS cluster formation is effectively suppressed even at a low TOCN binder content of 1 wt%, while a high S loading of 72 wt% is achieved. The resulting S cathode with the TOCN binder enables Li&#8210;S cells to exhibit a remarkable specific capacity of 1221 mAh gsulfur&#8722;1 under constrained electrolyte conditions (low electrolyte&#8208;to&#8208;sulfur ratio of 2.0&#160;&#181;L mgsulfur&#8722;1 and low density of 0.927&#160;g mL&#8722;1), yielding a high cell&#8208;level energy density of 503&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 that surpasses those of previously reported S cathodes based on conventional synthetic polymer binders.

         <title>The Structure&#8208;Mechanics Relationship of Bamboo&#8208;Epidermis and Inspired Composite Design by Artificial Intelligence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article investigates the micromechanics of bamboo epidermis, focusing on how anisotropic silica particle distributions enhance toughness. By integrating experimental imaging, 3D printing, and generative AI, the study develops bio&#8208;inspired particle&#8208;reinforced composites with mechanical properties akin to bamboo. The findings expand design possibilities for composites, offering innovative solutions for applications demanding high toughness and mechanical reliability.








Abstract
Bamboo culm has been widely used in engineering for its high strength, lightweight, and low cost. Its outermost epidermis is a smooth and dense layer that contains cellulose, silica particles, and stomata and acts as a water and mechanical barrier. Recent experimental studies have shown that the layer has a higher mechanical strength than other inside regions. Still, the mechanism is unclear, especially for how the low silica concentration (&lt;10%) can effectively reinforce the layer and prevent the inner fibers from splitting. Here, theoretical analysis is combined with experimental imaging and 3D printing to investigate the effect of the distribution of silica particles on composite mechanics. The anisotropic partial distribution function of silica particles in bamboo skin yields higher toughness (&gt;10%) than randomly distributed particles. A generative artificial intelligence (AI) model inspired by bamboo epidermis is developed to generate particle&#8208;reinforced composites. Besides the visual similarity, it is found that the samples by the generative model show failure processes and fracture toughness identical to the actual bamboo epidermis. This work reveals the micromechanics of the bamboo epidermis. It illustrates that generative AI can help design bio&#8208;inspired composites of a complex structure that cannot be uniformly represented by a simple building block or optimized around local boundaries. It expands the design space of particle&#8208;reinforced composites for enhanced toughness modulus, offering advantages in industries where mechanical reliability is critical.

         <title>Moisture&#8208;Dependent Vibrational Dynamics and Phonon Transport in Nanocellulose Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Uptake of water in cellulose play an important role in modulating the structure and phonon transport. This study reports how moisture&#8208;dependent structural modification relates to the vibrational dynamics and phonon transport and scattering of nanocellulose using inelastic neutron scattering and wide angle X&#8208;ray scattering. Phonon transport is controlled by the moisture&#8208;induced increase of the coherence length and swelling of the foam walls.








Abstract
Superinsulating nanofibrillar cellulose foams have the potential to replace fossil&#8208;based insulating materials, but the development is hampered by the moisture&#8208;dependent heat transport and the lack of direct measurements of phonon transport. Here, inelastic neutron scattering is used together with wide angle X&#8208;ray scattering (WAXS) and small angle neutron scattering to relate the moisture&#8208;dependent structural modifications to the vibrational dynamics and phonon transport and scattering of cellulose nanofibrils from wood and tunicate, and wood cellulose nanocrystals (W&#8208;CNC). The moisture interacted primarily with the disordered regions in nanocellulose, and WAXS showed that the crystallinity and coherence length increased as the moisture content increased. The phonon population derived from directional&#8208;dependent phonon density of states (GDOS) increased along the cellulose chains in W&#8208;CNC between 5 and 8 wt% D2O, while the phonon population perpendicular to the chains remained&#160;relatively unaffected, suggesting that the effect of increased crystallinity and coherence length on phonon transport is compensated by the moisture&#8208;induced swelling of the foam walls. Frequency scaling in the low&#8208;energy GDOS showed that materials based on hygroscopic and semicrystalline nanocellulose falls in between the predicted behavior for solids and liquids. Phonon&#8208;engineering of hygroscopic biopolymer&#8208;based insulation materials is promoted by the insights on the moisture&#8208;dependent phonon&#160;transport.

Phonon-engineering of hygroscopic biopolymer-based insulation materials is promoted by the insights on the moisture-dependent phonon&#160;transport.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biomimetic Intrafibrillar Mineralization of Hierarchically Structured Amyloid&#8208;Like Fibrils</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Hierarchically Structured Amyloid&#8208;like Fibrils (HSAF), prepared through a mechanically directed two&#8208;step transformation of a protein nanofilm, exhibit an ordered, dynamic layered structure with adaptive gaps that facilitate intrafibrillar mineralization. The mineralized HSAF mimics biological hard tissues with ordered protein&#8208;hydroxyapatite organization, and demonstrates exceptional bioactivity in promoting native bone growth and further intrafibrillar mineralization.









Abstract
Intrafibrillar mineralization is essential not only as a fundamental process in forming biological hard tissues but also as a foundation for developing advanced composite fibril&#8208;based materials for innovative applications. Traditionally, only natural collagen fibrils have been shown to enable intrafibrillar mineralization, presenting a challenge in designing ordered hierarchical fibrils from common protein aggregation that exhibit similar high intrafibrillar mineralization activity. In this study, a mechanically directed two&#8208;step transformation method is developed that converts phase&#8208;transitioned protein nanofilms into crystalline, hierarchical amyloid&#8208;like fibrils with multilayer structures, which effectively control the growth and lateral organization of hydroxyapatite within adaptive gaps. The resulting mineralized HSAF achieves a hardness of 0.616 &#177;&#160;0.007&#160;GPa and a modulus of 19.06 &#177;&#160;3.54 GPa&#8212;properties closely resembling native hard tissues&#8212;and exhibits exceptionally high bioactivity in promoting both native bone tissue growth and further intrafibrillar mineralization, achieving 76.9% repair in a mice cranial defect model after 8 weeks and outperforming other regenerative materials. This remarkable performance, stemming from the unique structure and composition of the fibers, positions HSAF as a promising candidate for biomedical and engineering applications. These findings advance the understanding of biomineralization mechanisms and establish a foundation for developing high&#8208;bioactivity materials for hard tissue regeneration.

         <title>Living Fiber Dispersions from Mycelium as a New Sustainable Platform for Advanced Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Living fiber dispersions (LFD) from mycelium and their extracellular materials are prepared by a facile three&#8208;roll milling process. These dispersions can be easily converted into a wide array of multifunctional living materials. These living materials display increased emulsion stability, enhanced mechanical properties, superhydrophobicity, and instantaneous proximity sensing as a result of fungal growth.








Abstract
Functional biopolymeric fibers are key building blocks for developing sustainable materials within the growing bioeconomy. However, their flexible use in emerging advanced materials with smart properties typically requires processing methods that may compromise sustainability. Here, a sustainable route to generate living fiber dispersions (LFD) from mycelium that combines the excellent material&#8208;forming properties of biopolymeric fibers, and the highly dynamic properties of living materials is proposed. This is showcased by using industrially available liquid culture and mechanical defibrillation methods to generate well&#8208;dispersed living mycelium fibers. These fibers can form materials where precursors with good dispersibility and network formation properties are paramount and can harness dynamic properties through growth even in the absence of added nutrients. This is demonstrated in unique living emulsions with 3.6x slower phase separation and in living films with 2.5x higher tensile strength upon growth, the latter vastly outperforming the strongest pure mycelium materials to date. Further, humidity can be used to modulate mechanical properties and to trigger the superhydrophobic patterning of substrates, mechanical actuation, and degradation of lignocellulosic consumer goods at their end of life. In the future, combining synthetic biology with this promising platform for smart materials can expand the horizons for sustainable material manufacturing.

         <title>Molecularly Functionalized Biomass Hydrogels for Sustainable Atmospheric Water Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A generalizable molecular engineering methodology is developed to transform diverse biomass feedstocks, such as cellulose, starch, and chitosan, into efficient hydrogel sorbents for atmospheric water harvesting (AWH). Outdoor tests reveal a water production rate of up to 14.19&#160;kg kg&#8315;&#185; day&#8315;&#185;, demonstrating significant potential for sustainable water solutions. This approach advances scalable AWH technologies by leveraging abundant, environmentally friendly resources.








Abstract
Atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) offers a promising pathway to alleviate global water scarcity, highlighting the need for environmentally responsible sorbent materials. In this context, this research introduces a universal strategy for transforming natural polysaccharides into effective hydrogel sorbents, demonstrated with cellulose, starch, and chitosan. The methodology unites alkylation to graft thermoresponsive groups, thereby enhancing water processability and enabling energy&#8208;efficient water release at lower temperatures, with the integration of zwitterionic groups to ensure stable and effective water sorption. The molecularly functionalized cellulose hydrogel, exemplifying our approach, shows favorable water uptake of 0.86&#8211;1.32&#160;g g&#8722;1 at 15&#8211;30% relative humidity (RH), along with efficient desorption, releasing 95% of captured water at 60 &#176;C. Outdoor tests highlight the water production rate of up to 14.19&#160;kg kg&#8722;1 day&#8722;1 by electrical heating. The proposed molecular engineering methodology, which expands the range of raw materials by leveraging abundant biomass feedstock, has the potential to advance sorbent production and scalable AWH technologies, contributing to sustainable solutions.

         <title>Sustainable Silk Fibroin Ionic Touch Screens for Flexible Biodegradable Electronics with Integrated AI and IoT Functionality</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A silk fibroin ionic touchscreen platform with high elasticity, high environmental tolerance, and biodegradability, is introduced for sustainable flexible electronics. This study showcases the platform's environmental stability, reusability, and advanced applications in IoT and AI&#8208;enhanced interfaces, such as real&#8208;time touch sensing, handwriting recognition, and virtual reality, paving the way for greener next&#8208;generation devices.








Abstract
The increasing prevalence of electronic devices has led to a significant rise in electronic waste (e&#8208;waste), necessitating the development of sustainable materials for flexible electronics. In this study, silk fibroin ionic touch screen (SFITS) is introduced, a new platform integrating natural silk fibroin (SF) with ionic conductors to create highly elastic, environmentally stable, and multifunctional touch interfaces. Through a humidity&#8208;induced crystallization strategy, the molecular structure of SF is precisely controlled to achieve a balanced combination of mechanical strength, electrical conductivity, and biodegradability. The assembly and operational reliability of SFITS are demonstrated under various environmental conditions, along with their reusability through green recycling methods. Additionally, the intelligent design and application of SFITS are explored by incorporating Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. This integration enables real&#8208;time touch sensing, handwriting recognition, and advanced human&#8208;computer interactions. The versatility of SFITS is further exemplified through applications in remote control systems, molecular model generation, and virtual reality interfaces. The findings highlight the potential of sustainable ionic conductors in next&#8208;generation flexible electronics, offering a path toward greener and more intelligent device designs.

The closed&#8208;pore structure of hard carbons holds the key to high plateau capacity and rapid diffusion kinetics when applied as sodium&#8208;ion battery (SIB) anodes. However, understanding and establishing the structure&#8208;electrochemistry relationship still remains a significant challenge. This work, for the first time, introduces an innovative deep eutectic solvent (DES) cell&#8208;shearing strategy to precisely tailor the cell structure of natural bamboo and consequently the closed&#8208;pore in its derived hard carbons. The DES shearing force effectively modifies the pore architecture by simultaneously shearing and dissolving amorphous components to form closed pore cores with adjustable sizes, as well as disintegrating crystalline cellulose through generation of competing hydrogen bonds to elaborately tune the pore wall thickness and ordering. The optimized closed&#8208;pore structure featuring appropriate pore size (&#8764;2 nm) and ultra&#8208;thin (1&#8211;3 layers) disordered pore walls, exhibits abundant active sites and delivers rapid ion diffusion kinetics and high reaction reversibility. Consequently, a high reversible capacity of 422 mAh g&#8722;1 at 30 mA g&#8722;1 along with an exceptional rate capability (318.6 mAh g&#8722;1 at 6 A g&#8722;1) are achieved, outperforming almost all previous reported hard carbons. The new concept of cell&#8208;shearing chemistry for closed&#8208;pore regeneration significantly advances the applications of biomass materials for energy storage.

         <title>Self&#8208;Reinforcing Ionogel Bioadhesive Interface for Robust Integration and Monitoring of Bioelectronic Devices with Hard Tissues</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A silk&#8208;based self&#8208;reinforcing ionogel shows good adhesion performance on biological hard tissues, common bioelectrode materials, and hard biomaterials. It can be assembled with the gold resonant circuit to form a wireless sensor to monitor the wound&#8208;healing process of biological hard tissues.








Abstract
Integrating bioelectronic devices with hard tissues, such as bones and teeth, is essential for advancing diagnostic and therapeutic technologies. However, stable and durable adhesion in dynamic, moist environments remains challenging. Traditional bioadhesives often fail to maintain strong bonds, especially when interfacing with metal electrodes and hard tissues. This study introduces a self&#8208;reinforcing ionogel bioadhesive interface (IGBI) combining silk fibroin and calcium ions, designed to provide robust and conductive integration of bioelectronic devices with hard tissues. The IGBI exhibits strong adhesion (up to 186&#160;J&#160;m&#8722;2) and undergoes mechanical self&#8208;reinforcement through a structural transition in silk fibroin under physiological conditions. In vivo experiments demonstrate the IGBI's effectiveness in repairing bone defects and reimplanting teeth, with the added capability of wireless, real&#8208;time monitoring of bone healing. This approach allows for continuous tracking of tissue regeneration without a second invasive surgery for device removal. The IGBI represents a significant advancement in bioelectronic integration, offering a durable and versatile solution for challenging environments. Such unique self&#8208;reinforcing properties make the IGBI a promising material for biomedical applications where traditional adhesives are insufficient.

         <title>Bioinspired Nanochitin&#8208;Based Porous Constructs for Light&#8208;Driven Whole&#8208;Cell Biotransformations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomimetically cross&#8208;linked nanochitin cryogels are used for immobilization matrix for a solid&#8208;state cell factory. The resulting cryogels with hierarchical porosity manage to overcome the conventional limitations of mass transfer and light transmittance, as demonstrated by a number of light&#8208;driven biotransformation reactions.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state photosynthetic cell factories (SSPCFs) are a new production concept that leverages the innate photosynthetic abilities of microbes to drive the production of valuable chemicals. It addresses practical challenges such as high energy and water demand and improper light distribution associated with suspension&#8208;based culturing; however, these systems often face significant challenges related to mass transfer. The approach focuses on overcoming these limitations by carefully engineering the microstructure of the immobilization matrix through freeze&#8208;induced assembly of nanochitin building blocks. The use of nanochitins with optimized size distribution enabled the formation of macropores with lamellar spatial organization, which significantly improves light transmittance and distribution, crucial for maximizing the efficiency of photosynthetic reactions. The biomimetic crosslinking strategy, leveraging specific interactions between polyphosphate anions and primary amine groups featured on chitin fibers, produced mechanically robust and wet&#8208;resilient cryogels that maintained their functionality under operational conditions. Various model biotransformation reactions leading to value&#8208;added chemicals are performed in chitin&#8208;based matrix. It demonstrates superior or comparable performance to existing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art matrices and suspension&#8208;based systems. The findings suggest that chitin&#8208;based cryogel approach holds significant promise for advancing the development of solid&#8208;state photosynthetic cell factories, offering a scalable solution to improve the efficiency and productivity of light&#8208;driven biotransformation.

         <title>SciAgents: Automating Scientific Discovery Through Bioinspired Multi&#8208;Agent Intelligent Graph Reasoning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The SciAgents AI model drives hypothesis generation by harnessing multi&#8208;agent graph reasoning, extracting insights from knowledge graphs constructed from scientific papers. Each agent plays a specific role: the Ontologist defines concepts, the Scientists draft and refine proposals, and the Critic reviews. Together, these agents create data&#8208;driven, innovative research ideas, advancing beyond traditional, human&#8208;led approaches.








Abstract
A key challenge in artificial intelligence (AI) is the creation of systems capable of autonomously advancing scientific understanding by exploring novel domains, identifying complex patterns, and uncovering previously unseen connections in vast scientific data. In this work, SciAgents, an approach that leverages three core concepts is presented: (1) large&#8208;scale ontological knowledge graphs to organize and interconnect diverse scientific concepts, (2) a suite of large language models (LLMs) and data retrieval tools, and (3) multi&#8208;agent systems with in&#8208;situ learning capabilities. Applied to biologically inspired materials, SciAgents reveals hidden interdisciplinary relationships that were&#160;previously considered unrelated, achieving a scale, precision, and exploratory power that surpasses human research methods. The framework autonomously generates and refines research hypotheses, elucidating underlying mechanisms, design principles, and unexpected material properties. By integrating these capabilities in a modular fashion, the system yields material discoveries, critiques and improves existing hypotheses, retrieves up&#8208;to&#8208;date data about existing research, and highlights strengths and limitations. This is achieved by harnessing a &#8220;swarm of intelligence&#8221; similar to biological systems, providing new avenues for discovery. How this model accelerates the development of advanced materials by unlocking Nature's design principles, resulting in a new biocomposite with enhanced mechanical properties and improved sustainability through energy&#8208;efficient production is shown.

         <title>Sustainable Smart Packaging from Protein Nanofibrils</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Smart packaging can extend shelf life and improve food quality monitoring. This study introduces a novel smart packaging solution using amyloid fibrils and red radish anthocyanins to monitor seafood spoilage. These findings show that these films effectively indicate shrimp freshness and possess high antibacterial and antioxidant properties, offering a sustainable approach to food packaging.








Abstract
Smart packaging technologies are revolutionizing the food industry by extending shelf life and enhancing quality monitoring through environmental responsiveness. Here, a novel smart packaging concept is presented, based on amyloid fibrils (AM) and red radish anthocyanins (RRA), to effectively monitor food spoilage by color change. A protein nanofibrils biofilm is developed from whey protein, which is functionalized with RRA to endow the resulting films with advanced monitoring capabilities. A comprehensive characterization, including pH responsiveness, water vapor permeability, thermal and mechanical testing, and colorimetric responses, demonstrates the superiority of AM/RRA films compared to control films based on whey monomer building blocks. The findings indicate that the AM/RRA films can effectively monitor, for example, shrimp freshness, showing visible changes within one day at room temperature and significant alterations in color after two days. Furthermore, these films exhibit high antibacterial and antioxidant activities, reinforcing their suitability for efficient food packaging. By integrating bio&#8208;based materials from whey and natural anthocyanins, this research presents a biodegradable, sustainable, and cost&#8208;effective smart packaging solution, contributing to eco&#8208;friendly innovations in food preservation.

         <title>Low&#8208;Cost Hyperelastic Fuller&#8208;Dome&#8208;Structured Nanocellulose Aerogels by Dual Templates for Personal Thermal Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;cost mechanically ultra&#8208;resilient cellulose&#8208;based aerogel with Fuller&#8208;dome&#8208;like structure is developed by a dual&#8208;template strategy. The aerogel shows a desired cost&#8208;performance combination of low density, hypereslaticity, superhydrophobicity, ultralow thermal conductivity, and low cost, making it hold great promise as a thermal retention material for personal thermal management.








Abstract
It is critically important to maintain the body's thermal comfort for human beings in extremely cold environments. Cellulose nanofibers (CNF)&#8208;based aerogels represent a promising sustainable material for body's heat retention because of their renewability and low thermal conductivity. However, CNF&#8208;based aerogels often suffer high production costs due to expensive CNF, poor elasticity and/or unsatisfactory thermal insulation owing to improper microstructure design. Here, a facile dual&#8208;template strategy is reported to prepare a low&#8208;cost, hyperelastic, superhydrophobic Fuller&#8208;dome&#8208;structured CNF aerogel (CNF@PU) with low thermal conductivity. The combination of air template by foaming process and ice template enables the formation of a dome&#8208;like microstructure of CNF@PU aerogel, in which CNF serves as rope bars while inexpensive polyurethane (PU) acts as joints. The aerogel combines ultra&#8208;elasticity, low thermal conductivity (24&#160;mW m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1), and low costs. The as&#8208;prepared CNF@PU aerogel demonstrates much better heat retention than commercial thermal retention fillers (e.g., Flannelette and goose down), promising its great commercial potential for massively producing warming garments. This work provides a facile approach for creating high&#8208;performance aerogels with tailored microstructure for effective personal thermal management.

         <title>Spray&#8208;Assisted Fabrication of Cellulose Photonic Pigments on Superhydrophobic Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method to directly produce structurally colored microparticles by drying cholesteric cellulose nanocrystal microdroplets on a superhydrophobic surface is reported. This approach has several key advantages that can unlock large&#8208;scale fabrication of sustainable photonic pigments, including exploiting existing industrial techniques (e.g. aerosolization), reduction in chemicals required (e.g. surfactants), rapid production times (&#8776;40 min or less), and size&#8208;independent and robust color.









Abstract
Photonic pigments, especially those based on naturally&#8208;derived building blocks like cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), are emerging as a promising sustainable alternative to absorption&#8208;based colorants. However, the proposed manufacturing methods for CNC pigments, via either grinding films or emulsion&#8208;based production, usually require several processing steps. This limits their commercialization by increasing the costs, timescales, and environmental impacts of production. Toward addressing these challenges, it is reported that photonic pigments can be produced in a single process by drying microdroplets of aqueous CNC suspension on a superhydrophobic surface. Such liquid&#8208;repellent substrate ensures the microdroplets maintain a near&#8208;spherical shape, enabling the radial self&#8208;organization of the cholesteric phase. Upon drying under ambient conditions, the CNC mesophase becomes kinetically arrested, after which the strong capillary forces induced by water evaporation result in extensive buckling of the microparticle. This buckling, coupled with prior tuning of the CNC formulation, enables photonic pigments with adjustable color across the visible spectrum. Importantly, the elimination of an emulsifying oil phase to create microdroplets enables a much faster drying time (&#8776;40 min) and improved color stability (e.g., polar solvents, elevated temperatures), while the reduction in reagents (e.g., oils, surfactants) and post&#8208;processing steps (e.g., solvent, heat) improves the sustainability of the fabrication process.

         <title>Engineering Triboelectric Paper for Energy Harvesting and Smart Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering nano&#8208;graphite coated paper (NG@P) is produced to serve as triboelectric layers and electrodes for TENGs. Ultra&#8208;high power density above 14 kW&#160;m&#8722;2 is achieved due to the electrostatic discharge on the surface. Moreover, smart home sensors are fabricated using the NG@P for motion sensing and sleep monitoring, which could be used for security and healthcare applications.








Abstract
Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) represent a promising technology for energy harvesting and self&#8208;powered sensing with a wide range of applications. Despite their potential, challenges such as the need for cost&#8208;effective, large&#8208;area electrodes and engineering sustainable triboelectric materials remain, especially given the impending restrictions on single&#8208;use engineering plastics in Europe. To address these challenges, engineering nano&#8208;graphite&#8208;coated paper is presented as a sustainable and high&#8208;performance alternative for triboelectric layers. Moreover, this material, which can be produced on an industrial scale, offers a viable replacement for metal electrodes. The combination of nano&#8208;graphite and paper, with its large contact area and inherent surface roughness, enables ultra&#8208;high power densities exceeding 14 kW&#160;m&#8722;2, driven by electrostatic discharge at the surface. Beyond energy harvesting, smart sensors are developed for floors and walls that detect movements for security purposes and smart sheets that monitor body movements and physiological activities during sleep. The findings highlight the potential of this engineering paper to serve as an eco&#8208;friendly alternative to engineering plastics in TENGs and electrodes, opening new avenues for future applications.

         <title>Environmental Sustainability of Natural Biopolymer&#8208;Based Electrolytes for Lithium Ion Battery Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Twenty&#8208;one biopolymer electrolytes including membrane&#8208;liquid electrolytes, gel electrolytes, and solid electrolytes are synthesized to analyze their electrochemical properties and environmental impacts through life cycle assessment. This consistent and comparable study demonstrates the significant functional and environmental benefits of biopolymer electrolytes for batteries, guiding academia and industry in fundamental studies and applied implementation of sustainable bio&#8208;based polymers and biopolymer electrolytes.








Abstract
Biopolymer based electrolytes can overcome current performance limitations of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Biopolymers enable electrolytes with high ionic conductivities and wide electrochemical stability windows. While the biobased character of natural materials is claimed as an inherent advantage in meeting current environmental sustainability challenges, further research is required to quantify and compare their environmental impacts as electrolytes. The challenge is addressed by identifying the most promising biopolymer electrolytes for LIBs, measuring ionic conductivities and electrochemical stability windows, and quantifying environmental impacts using life cycle assessment. The environmental impacts of the cost to isolate cellulose derivatives, nanocelluloses, chitin/nanochitin, chitosan, lignin, agar, and silk are reported for climate change, acidification, freshwater ecotoxicity, marine eutrophication, human toxicity, and water use. Material criticality, circularity index, and material circularity indicator, emerging impact categories are prioritized to help integrate biopolymers into circular and sustainable materials. The electrochemical properties and environmental impacts of natural biopolymer membrane&#8208;liquid electrolyte pairs, gel electrolytes, and solid electrolytes are quantified and benchmarked against conventional fossil&#8208;based electrolytes, providing consistent and comparable electrochemical properties of the most relevant biopolymer electrolytes fabricated so far. This study highlights the significant functional and environmental benefits of biopolymer electrolytes and identifies the most electrochemically competitive biopolymer electrolytes in LIBs.

         <title>Nanocellulose&#8208;Derived Hierarchical Carbon Framework&#8208;Supported P&#8208;Doped MoO2 Nanoparticles for Optimizing Redox Kinetics in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using nanocellulose as a building block, P&#8208;doped MoO2&#8722;x nanoparticles anchored on N, P co&#8208;doped porous carbon are constructed by in situ polymerization and hydrothermal treatment combined with phosphorylation. When being used for modifying the commercial separator of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries, the composite provides abundant catalytic active sites and rapid ion accessibility. The assembled cell achieves an initial specific capacity of 11.3 mAh cm&#8722;2 at a sulfur loading of 8.1 mg cm&#8722;2 under lean electrolyte conditions.








Abstract
The integration of nanocatalysts into the separators of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs) boosts the polysulfide conversion efficiency. However, the aggregation of catalyst nanoparticles diminishes the active surface area. Moreover, densely packed catalyst&#8208;modified layers often hinder ion transport rates and impede access to the catalytic sites. To overcome these challenges, a strategy is reported for modifying commercial separators, using wood nanocellulose as a building block to construct hierarchical P&#8208;doped MoO2&#8722;x nanoparticles anchored on N, P co&#8208;doped porous carbon (P&#8208;MoO2&#8722;x/NPC). The web&#8208;like entangled nanocellulose forms a framework for the in situ polymerization of polyaniline, providing abundant anchoring sites for MoO2 nanoparticles. The addition of P atoms optimizes the d&#8208;band center of MoO2 and enhances the catalytic activity of polysulfide conversion. The LSBs assembled using a P&#8208;MoO2&#8722;x/NPC coated polypropylene separator display an initial discharge capacity of 1621 mAh g&#8722;1 and rate performance of 774 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 C. Even with a sulfur loading of 8.1&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 and lean electrolyte conditions, the cell achieves an initial areal capacity of 11.3 mAh cm&#8722;2 at 0.1 C. This work provides a biopolymer nanofiber solution for constructing LSB separators with advanced electrochemical reactivity.

&lt;p&gt;Using nanocellulose as a building block, P-doped MoO&lt;sub&gt;2&#8722;x&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles anchored on N, P co-doped porous carbon are constructed by in situ polymerization and hydrothermal treatment combined with phosphorylation. When being used for modifying the commercial separator of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries, the composite provides abundant catalytic active sites and rapid ion accessibility. The assembled cell achieves an initial specific capacity of 11.3 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at a sulfur loading of 8.1 mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; under lean electrolyte conditions.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The integration of nanocatalysts into the separators of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs) boosts the polysulfide conversion efficiency. However, the aggregation of catalyst nanoparticles diminishes the active surface area. Moreover, densely packed catalyst-modified layers often hinder ion transport rates and impede access to the catalytic sites. To overcome these challenges, a strategy is reported for modifying commercial separators, using wood nanocellulose as a building block to construct hierarchical P-doped MoO&lt;sub&gt;2&#8722;x&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles anchored on N, P co-doped porous carbon (P-MoO&lt;sub&gt;2&#8722;x&lt;/sub&gt;/NPC). The web-like entangled nanocellulose forms a framework for the in situ polymerization of polyaniline, providing abundant anchoring sites for MoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles. The addition of P atoms optimizes the d-band center of MoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and enhances the catalytic activity of polysulfide conversion. The LSBs assembled using a P-MoO&lt;sub&gt;2&#8722;x&lt;/sub&gt;/NPC coated polypropylene separator display an initial discharge capacity of 1621 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and rate performance of 774 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 5 C. Even with a sulfur loading of 8.1&#160;mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and lean electrolyte conditions, the cell achieves an initial areal capacity of 11.3 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.1 C.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Complex evolutionary pressures result in unique protein fiber designs for silks. This includes multi&#8208;domain features and novel amino acid content that accommodate aqueous processing environments with remarkable functional properties. Bioengineering approaches inform new material formats and functions realized with silks. These design features provide a blueprint for future polymer designs with robust functions and sustainability as guideposts.








Abstract
This is a Perspective on nature as a story&#8208;teller, where inputs of evolution drove the remarkable protein designs found in silks. This selection process has resulted in silk materials with novel chemistry and properties to support organism survival in nature, yet with newfound utility in everything from comic books and automobiles to medicine. With growing global concerns related to environmental health, silks also serve as an invaluable instructional guide to the future of sustainable material designs.

         <title>A Bio&#8208;Inspired Perspective on Materials Sustainability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective discusses natural materials as inspiration for sustainable engineering designs and the processing of materials. First, circularity, longevity, parsimony, and activity are presented as essential material paradigms. The perspective then uses many examples of natural and technical materials to introduce principles such as oligo&#8208;materiality, multifunctionality, modularity, defect tolerance, remodeling, healing, adaptivity, as well as controlled disintegration.








Abstract
The article explores materials sustainability through a bio&#8208;inspired lens and discusses paradigms that can reshape the understanding of material synthesis, processing, and usage. It addresses various technological fields, from structural engineering to healthcare, and emphasizes natural material cycles as a blueprint for efficient recycling and reuse. The study shows that material functionality depends on both chemical composition and structural modifications, which emphasizes the role of material processing. The article identifies strategies such as mono&#8208;materiality and multifunctionality, and explores how responsivity, adaptivity, modularity, and cellularity can simplify material assembly and disassembly. Bioinspired strategies for reusing materials, defect tolerance, maintenance, remodeling, and healing may extend product lifespans. The principles of circularity, longevity, and parsimony are reconsidered in the context of &#8220;active materiality&#8221;, a dynamic bio&#8208;inspired paradigm. This concept expands the traditional focus of material science from structure&#8208;function relationships to include the development of materials capable of responding or adapting to external stimuli. Concrete examples demonstrate how bio&#8208;inspired strategies are being applied in engineering and technology to enhance the sustainability of materials. The article concludes by emphasizing interdisciplinary collaboration as a key factor for developing a sustainable and resilient materials economy in harmony with nature's material cycles.

         <title>Wood and Cellulose: the Most Sustainable Advanced Materials for Past, Present, and Future Civilizations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wood and cellulose are the most abundant and important sustainable materials on the planet at the disposal to solve major societal challenges. This perspective, written for all materials scientists, highlights how breakthroughs in cellulose nanotechnology combined with functional nanomaterials can revolutionize important areas like construction, electronics, recycling, and intelligent materials at scale, toward a sustainable future.








Abstract
Wood, with its constituent building block cellulose, is by far the most common biomaterial on the planet and has been the most important material used by humans to establish civilization. If there is one single biomaterial that should be studied and used by materials scientists across disciplines to achieve a sustainable future, it is cellulose. This perspective provides insights for the general materials science community about the unique properties of wood and cellulose and how they may be used in advanced sustainable materials to make a substantial societal impact. The focus is on sawn wood or cellulose fibers produced at scale by industry and the more recent cellulosic nanomaterials, highlighting the areas where these cellulose&#8208;based materials can be valorized into higher&#8208;order functions. Numerous articles have comprehensively reviewed different areas where cellulose is currently used in advanced materials science. The objective here is to provide general insight for all material scientists and to provide the opinions about the areas in which cellulose and wood have the largest potential to make a significant societal impact, especially to realize next&#8208;generation sustainable materials for construction, food, water, energy, and information. Discussing key areas where future research is needed to open avenues toward a more sustainable future is ended.
