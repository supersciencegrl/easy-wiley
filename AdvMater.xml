         <title>Robust Piezoelectricity with Spontaneous Polarization in Monolayer Tellurene and Multilayer Tellurium Film at Room Temperature for Reliable Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Robust piezoelectricity with spontaneous polarization is detected in tellurene at room temperature due to the strong anisotropic property and dipoles induced by unique charity helical chain structure and strong intramolecular interactions. A charming memory window and high on switching current are realized in tellurene&#8208;based memory, providing a new platform to construct robust memory cells for neuromorphic computing.








Abstract
Robust neuromorphic computing in the Big Data era calls for long&#8208;term stable crossbar&#8208;array memory cells; however, the elemental segregation in the switch unit and memory unit that inevitably occurs upon cycling breaks the compositional and structural stability, making the whole memory cell a failure. Searching for a novel material without segregation that can be used for both switch and memory units is the major concern to fabricate robust and reliable nonvolatile cross&#8208;array memory cells. Tellurium (Te) is found recently to be the only peculiar material without segregation for switching, but the memory function has not been demonstrated yet. Herein, apparent piezoelectricity is experimentally confirmed with spontaneous polarization behaviors in elementary 2D Te, even in monolayer tellurene (0.4&#160;nm), due to the highly oriented polarization of the molecular structure and the non&#8208;centrosymmetric lattice structure. A large memory window of 7000, a low working voltage of 2&#160;V, and high on switching current up to 36.6 &#181;A&#8201;&#181;m&#8722;1 are achieved in the as&#8208;fabricated Te&#8208;based memory device, revealing the great promise of Te for both switching and memory units in one cell without segregation. The piezoelectric Te with spontaneous polarization provides a platform to build robust, reliable, and high&#8208;density logic&#8208;in&#8208;memory chips in neuromorphic computing.

         <title>Stability of Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes: Existing Issues and Mitigation Strategies Related to both Material and Device Aspects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Metal halide perovskites combine excellent electronic and optical properties such as defect tolerance and high photoluminescence efficiency with the benefits of low&#8208;cost, large area, solution&#8208;based processing. Composition&#8208; and dimension&#8208;tunable properties of perovskites have already been utilized in bright and efficient light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). At the same time, there are still great challenges ahead to achieve operational and spectral stability of these devices. In this review, we consider the origins of instability of perovskite materials, and reasons for their degradation in LEDs. We then review the strategies on improving the stability of perovskite materials such as compositional engineering, dimensionality control, defect passivation, suitable encapsulation matrices, and fabrication of core/shell perovskite nanocrystals. For improvement of the operational stability of perovskite LEDs, we consider use of inorganic charge transport layers, optimization of charge balance, and proper thermal management. We conclude this review with a detailed account of the current challenges and a perspective on the key approaches and opportunities on how to reach the goal of stable, bright and efficient perovskite LEDs.

         <title>Advances in Colloidal Building Blocks: Toward Patchy Colloidal Clusters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
A scalable synthetic route to colloidal atoms has significantly advanced over the past two decades. Recently, colloidal clusters with DNA&#8208;coated cores called &#8220;patchy colloidal clusters&#8221; have been developed, providing a directional bonding with specific angle of rotation due to the shape complementarity between colloidal clusters. Through a DNA&#8208;mediated interlocking process, they were directly assembled into low&#8208;coordination colloidal structures, such as cubic diamond lattices. This review details the significant progress in recent years in the synthesis of&#160;patchy colloidal clusters and their assembly in experiments and simulations. Furthermore, an outlook is given on the emerging approaches to the patchy colloidal clusters and their potential applications in photonic crystals, metamaterials, topological photonic insulators, and separation membranes.

         <title>A Soft Magnetoelastic Generator for Wind Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The current energy crises and imminent danger of global warming severely limits our ability to scale societal development sustainably. As such, there is a pressing need for utilizing renewable, green energy sources such as wind energy which is ubiquitously available on Earth. In this work, we report a fundamentally new wind energy harvesting technology based on the giant magnetoelastic effect in a soft composite system, namely, magnetoelastic generators. Wind&#8208;induced mechanical deformation alters the magnetic field in a soft system, which converts wind energy into electricity via electromagnetic induction from arbitrary directions. The wind energy harvesting system features a low internal impedance of 68 &#937;, a high current density of 1.17&#160;mA cm&#8211;2, and a power density of 0.82&#160;mW cm&#8211;2 under ambient natural winds. The system is capable of sustainably driving small electronics and electrolytically splitting water. The system can generate hydrogen at a rate of 7.5 &#215; 10&#8211;2&#160;mL h&#8211;1 with a wind speed of 20 m/s. Additionally, since magnetic fields can penetrate water molecules, the magnetoelastic generators are intrinsically waterproof and work stably in harsh environments. This work paves way for wind energy harvesting with compelling features, which can contribute largely to the hydrogen economy and the sustainability of human civilization

         <title>Manipulating Offense and Defense Signaling to Fight Cold Tumors with Carrier&#8208;Free Nanoassembly of Fluorinated Prodrug and siRNA</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Chemoimmunotherapy has shown great potential to activate immune response, but immunosuppressive microenvironment associated T cell exhaustion remains a challenge in cancer therapy. The proper immune&#8208;modulatory strategy to provoke a robust immune response is to simultaneously regulate T&#8208;cell exhaustion and infiltration. Here, a new kind of carrier&#8208;free nanoparticle (NP) was developed to simultaneously deliver chemotherapeutic drug (doxorubicin, DOX), cytolytic peptide (melittin, MPI), and anti&#8208;TOX small interfering RNA (thymocyte selection&#8208;associated high mobility group box protein, TOX) using a fluorinated prodrug strategy. In this way, the enhanced immunogenic cell death induced by the combination of DOX and MPI can act as &#8220;offense&#8221; signaling to increase CD8+ T&#8208;cell infiltration, while the decreased TOX expression interfered with siTOX can serve as &#8220;defense&#8221; signaling to mitigate CD8+ T&#8208;cell exhaustion. As a result, the integration of DOX, MPI, and siTOX in such a bifunctional system produced a potent antitumor immune response in liver cancer and metastasis, making it a promising delivery platform and effective strategy for converting &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors into &#8220;hot&#8221; ones.

         <title>Optothermally Programmable Liquids with Spatiotemporal Precision and Functional Complexity</title>

Abstract
Due to the intrinsic lack of spatial order and self&#8208;supported shape, liquids are often incompatible with precision manufacturing/processing and are potentially limited for advanced functionality. Herein, we develop an optothermal strategy to fully command phase&#8208;separated liquids with unprecedent spatiotemporal addressability. Specifically, we focus a laser onto an Au film to create a hot spot that locally demixes a temperature&#8208;responsive solution to produce a single optothermal droplet. Spatial precision (&#8764; 1 micron) is assured by the well&#8208;defined thermal field and temporal accuracy (&#8764; 0.1 s) guaranteed by the fast heating and response rate. Time&#8208;multiplexed laser foci are deployed to engineer the thermal landscape as desired, which in turn dictates the formation/dissolution, positioning, shaping, and dynamic reconfiguration of the phase&#8208;separated liquids. We further program laser foci to orchestrate the liquid patterns in a time&#8208;continuous manner to produce liquid animations on the microscale with high fidelity. While focused laser has been routinely used to manipulate solid particles or to microfabricate solid materials, the current strategy embraces the merits of liquid and features functional complexity in information encryption, payload transportation, and reaction localization. We expect it to be further applicable in scenarios such as subcellular organization of biomolecular condensates and programmable modulation of nonequilibrium systems.

         <title>Highly Sensitive Photoelectric Detection and Imaging Enhanced by the Pyro&#8208;Phototronic Effect Based on a Photoinduced Dynamic Schottky Effect in 4H&#8208;SiC</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance self&#8208;powered 4H&#8208;SiC ultraviolet photodetector is realized using a strong photoinduced dynamic Schottky effect, and the pyro&#8208;phototronic effect is first revealed in N&#8208;doped 4H&#8208;SiC, which is beneficial to further enhance the photodetection performance. Moreover, via delicate position designs of electrodes, the 4H&#8208;SiC chip reveals efficient optical imaging and information transmission capabilities.








Abstract
Silicon carbide (SiC), one of the third&#8208;generation semiconductor materials with excellent electrical and optoelectronic properties, is ideal for high light&#8208;sensing performance. Here, a self&#8208;powered SiC ultraviolet (UV) photodetector (PD) is constructed with wider applicability and higher commercialization potential. The great performance of the PD is realized by a remarkable photoinduced dynamic Schottky effect derived from the symbiotic modulation of Schottky and Ohmic contact. Using the pyro&#8208;phototronic effect that exists in the N&#8208;doped 4H&#8208;SiC single crystal PDs, a fast pyroelectric response time of 0.27 s is achieved, which is almost ten times shorter than that obtained from the steady&#8208;state signal under UV illumination. The maximal transient photoresponsivity reaches 9.12 nA mW&#8722;1, which is &#8776;20% higher than the conventional photoelectric signal. Moreover, different regions of the 4H&#8208;SiC centimeter&#8208;scale chip output distinct signals under UV illumination, demonstrating efficient optical imaging and information transmission capabilities of this device. This work not only reveals the fundamental optoelectronic physics lying in this vital third&#8208;generation semiconductor, but also sheds light on its potential photosensing applications for large&#8208;scale commercialization.

         <title>A Room&#8208;Temperature Ferroelectric Resonant Tunneling Diode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Robust room&#8208;temperature ferroelectric modulated resonant tunneling and negative differential resistance (NDR) behaviors under external voltage in perovskite oxide BaTiO3/SrRuO3/BaTiO3 quantum&#8208;well structures are reported. The NDR ratio can be modified by &#8776;3 orders of magnitude, depending on the polarization states of the ferroelectric barrier, and a large OFF/ON resistance ratio up to 23 000 is obtained.








Abstract
Resonant tunneling is a quantum&#8208;mechanical effect in which electron transport is controlled by the discrete energy levels within a quantum&#8208;well (QW) structure. A ferroelectric resonant tunneling diode (RTD) exploits the switchable electric polarization state of the QW barrier to tune the device resistance. Here, the discovery of robust room&#8208;temperature ferroelectric&#8208;modulated resonant tunneling and negative differential resistance (NDR) behaviors in all&#8208;perovskite&#8208;oxide BaTiO3/SrRuO3/BaTiO3 QW structures is reported. The resonant current amplitude and voltage are tunable by the switchable polarization of the BaTiO3 ferroelectric with the NDR ratio modulated by &#8776;3 orders of magnitude and an OFF/ON resistance ratio exceeding a factor of 2&#160;&#215;&#160;104. The observed NDR effect is explained an energy bandgap between Ru&#8208;t2g and Ru&#8208;eg orbitals driven by electron&#8211;electron correlations, as follows from density functional theory calculations. This study paves the way for ferroelectric&#8208;based quantum&#8208;tunneling devices in future oxide electronics.

         <title>A Photoactivatable Silencing Extracellular Vesicle&#160;(PASEV) that Sensitizes Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoactivatable silencing extracellular vesicle is developed, which not only serves as a nanocarrier for packaging, tumor accumulation, and intracellular release of small interfering RNA against p21&#8208;activated kinase 4 to boost intratumoral&#160;immune infiltration, but also is able to initiate antitumor immunity through immunogenic phototherapy. The combined immunotherapy between boosted immune infiltration and immune activation elicits superior antitumor outcome.








Abstract
Immunotherapy has delivered impressive outcomes in combating tumor malignancies. However, insufficient immune infiltration and poor immunogenicity within the tumor microenvironment (TME) greatly compromise patient response rates. Here, a photoactivatable silencing extracellular vesicle (PASEV) is developed for sensitized cancer immunotherapy. p21&#8208;Activated kinase 4 (PAK4) is a newly identified tumor&#8208;cell&#8208;intrinsic &#8220;guard&#8221; associated with immune exclusion. Small interfering RNA against PAK4 (siPAK4) is designed and assembled with a photoactivatable reactive&#8208;oxygen&#8208;species (ROS)&#8208;sensitive polymer to form the nanocomplex core, which is further camouflaged by extracellular vesicles from M1 macrophages. The PASEV not only serves as a vehicle for packaging, tumor accumulation, and ROS&#8208;responsive release of siPAK4 for potent PAK4 silencing, but also primes the TME through immunogenic phototherapy, thereby simultaneously boosting intratumoral infiltration and immune activation. The combined immunotherapy elicits robust anticancer immunity, thus showing great promise for fighting cancers. This work opens a new avenue to simultaneously boost intratumoral infiltration and immune activation for sensitized cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Energy Interplay in Materials: Unlocking Next&#8208;Generation Synchronous Multisource Energy Conversion with Layered 2D Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Layered 2D crystals are exemplar energy conversion materials, able to convert light, heat, or motion to electricity. These energy conversion processes can also occur synchronously, leading to complex energy interplay networks during energy harvesting/transducing. This synchronous multisource energy conversion needs to be studied and understood to enable the fabrication of next&#8208;generation energy harvesting and conversion systems.








Abstract
Layered 2D crystals have unique properties and rich chemical and electronic diversity, with over 6000 2D crystals known and, in principle, millions of different stacked hybrid 2D crystals accessible. This diversity provides unique combinations of properties that can profoundly affect the future of energy conversion and harvesting devices. Notably, this includes catalysts, photovoltaics, superconductors, solar&#8208;fuel generators, and piezoelectric devices that will receive broad commercial uptake in the near future. However, the unique properties of layered 2D crystals are not limited to individual applications and they can achieve exceptional performance in multiple energy conversion applications synchronously. This synchronous multisource energy conversion (SMEC) has yet to be fully realized but offers a real game&#8208;changer in how devices will be produced and utilized in the future. This perspective highlights the energy interplay in materials and its impact on energy conversion, how SMEC devices can be realized, particularly through layered 2D crystals, and provides a vision of the future of effective environmental energy harvesting devices with layered 2D crystals.

         <title>Strain&#8208;driven Mixed&#8208;phase Domain Architectures and Topological Transitions in Pb1&#8208;xSrxTiO3 Thin Films</title>

Abstract
The potential for creating hierarchical domain structures, or mixtures of energetically degenerate phases with distinct patterns that can be modified continually, in ferroelectric thin films offers a pathway to control their mesoscale structure beyond lattice&#8208;mismatch strain with a substrate. Here, it is demonstrated that varying the strontium content provides deterministic strain&#8208;driven control of hierarchical domain structures in Pb1&#8208;xSrxTiO3 solid solution thin films wherein two types, c/a and a1/a2, of nanodomains can coexist. Combining phase&#8208;field simulations, epitaxial thin&#8208;film growth, and detailed structural, domain, and physical&#8208;property characterization, it is observed that the system undergoes a gradual transformation (with increasing strontium content) from droplet&#8208;like a1/a2 domains in a c/a domain matrix, to a connected&#8208;labyrinth geometry of c/a domains, to a disconnected labyrinth structure of the same, and, finally, to droplet&#8208;like c/a domains in an a1/a2 domain matrix. A relationship between the different mixed&#8208;phase modulation patterns and its topological nature is established. Annealing the connected&#8208;labyrinth structure leads to domain coarsening forming distinctive regions of parallel c/a and a1/a2 domain stripes, offering additional design flexibility. Finally, it is found that the connected&#8208;labyrinth domain patterns exhibit the highest dielectric permittivity.

         <title>Design Strategies for Hydroxyapatite&#8208;based Materials to Enhance Their Catalytic Performance and Applicability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hydroxyapatite (HAP) is a green catalyst which has a wide range of applications in the catalysis due to its high flexibility and multi&#8208;functionality. These properties allow HAP to accommodate a large number of catalyst modifications that can selectively improve the catalytic performance in target reactions. To date, many studies have been conducted to elucidate the effect of HAP modification on the catalytic activities for various reactions. However, systematic design strategies for HAP catalysts are not established yet due to incomplete understanding of underlying structure&#8208;activity relationships. In this review, tuning methods of HAP for improving the catalytic performance are discussed: (1) ionic composition change, (2) morphology control, (3) incorporation of other metal species, and (4) catalytic support engineering. We investigate detailed mechanisms and effects of structural modulations on the catalytic performances for attaining the design insights of HAP catalysts. In addition, computational studies to understand catalytic reactions on HAP materials are also introduced. Finally, important areas for future research are highlighted.

         <title>One&#8208;phototransistor&#8208;one&#8208;memristor Array with High&#8208;linearity Light&#8208;tunable Weight for Optic Neuromorphic Computing</title>

Abstract
The recent advances in optic neuromorphic devices have led to a subsequent rise in use for construction of energy&#8208;efficient artificial vision systems. The widespread use can be attributed to their ability to capture, store, and process visual information from the environment. The primary limitations of existing optic neuromorphic devices include nonlinear weight updates, cross&#8208;talk issues, and silicon process incompatibility. In this study, we experimentally demonstrate a highly&#8208;linear, light&#8208;tunable, cross&#8208;talk&#8208;free, and silicon&#8208;compatible one&#8208;phototransistor&#8208;one&#8208;memristor (1PT1R) optic memristor for the implementation of optic artificial neural networks (OANN). For optic image recognition in the experiment an OANN was constructed using a 16&#215;3 1PT1R memristor array, and it was trained on an online platform. The model yielded an accuracy of 99.3% after only 10 training epochs. The 1PT1R memristor, which shows good performance, demonstrated its ability as an excellent hardware solution for highly efficient optic neuromorphic and edge computing.

         <title>Determination of Crystallographic Orientation and Exposed Facets of Titanium Oxide Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanocrystals have attracted great attention in heterogeneous photocatalysis and photoelectricity fields for decades. However, contradictious conclusions on the reporting of crystallographic orientation and exposed facets of TiO2 nanocrystals frequently appeared in the literature. Herein, using anatase TiO2 nanocrystals with highly exposed {001} facets as a model, we clarified the misleading conclusions that exist on anatase nanocrystals. Although the TiO2&#8208;001 nanocrystals are recognized to be dominated by {001} facets, in fact, anatase nanocrystals with both dominating {001} and {111} facets are always co&#8208;existing due to the similarities in lattice fringes and intersection angles between two types of facets (0.38&#160;nm and 90&#176; in [001] direction, 0.35&#160;nm and 82&#176; in [111] direction). We also give a paradigm for determining the crystallographic orientation and exposed facets based on transmission electron microscope (TEM) analysis, which provides a universal methodology to nanomaterials for determining the orientation and exposed facets.

         <title>Challenging Bendable Organic Single Crystal and Transistor Arrays with High Mobility and Durability towards Flexible Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Bendable organic single crystals are promising candidates for flexible electronics owing to their superior charge transport properties. However, large&#8208;area high&#8208;quality organic single crystals are rarely available on polymer substrates generally used in flexible electronics. Here, a surface&#8208;assisted assembly strategy based on a polymer modification, poly (amic acid) (PAA), is developed to grow large&#8208;area organic singe crystals on polymer substrates using a simple drop&#8208;casting method. The unique surface properties of PAA that enable molecular solution superwetting and promote molecular ordered assembly produce an extraordinary self&#8208;driven &#8220;meniscus&#8208;guided coating&#8221; behavior, enabling the fabrication of millimeter&#8208;sized, highly aligned organic single crystals for a variety of organic semiconductors. Organic field&#8208;effect transistors based on a mode molecule of 2,7&#8208;dioctyl[1]benzothieno[3,2&#8208;b][1]benzothiophene (C8&#8208;BTBT) demonstrate the highest (average) mobility of 18.6 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 (15.9 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1), attractively low operating voltage of &#8722;3&#160;V, and high flexible durability. The results shed light on the large&#8208;area fabrication of organic single crystals on polymer dielectrics toward high&#8208;performance and integrated plastic electronics.

         <title>Building a Self&#8208;Adaptive Protective Layer on Ni&#8208;Rich Layered Cathodes to Enhance the Cycle Stability of Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Layered Ni&#8208;rich lithium transition metal oxides are promising battery cathodes due to their high specific capacity, but their poor cycling stability due to intergranular cracks in secondary particles restricts their practical applications. Surface engineering is an effective strategy for improving a cathode's cycling stability, but most reported surface coatings cannot adapt to the dynamic volume changes of cathodes. Herein, we build a self&#8208;adaptive polymer (polyrotaxane&#8208;co&#8208;polyacrylic acid) interfacial layer on LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2. The polymer layer with a slide&#8208;ring structure exhibits high toughness and can withstand the stress caused by particle volume changes, which can prevent the cracking of particles. In addition, the slide&#8208;ring polymer acts as a physicochemical barrier that suppresses surface side reactions and alleviates the dissolution of transition metallic ions, which ensures stable cycling performance. Thus, the as&#8208;prepared cathode shows significantly improved long&#8208;term cycling stability in situations in which cracks may easily occur, especially under high&#8208;rate, high&#8208;voltage, and high&#8208;temperature conditions.

         <title>Polishing Lead&#8208;Poor Surface for Efficient Inverted CsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Triiodide cesium lead perovskite (CsPbI3) has promising prospects in the development of efficient and stable photovoltaics in both single&#8208;junction and tandem structure. However, achieving inverted devices which provide good stability and are compatible to tandem devices, remains a challenge and the deep insights are still unintelligible. In this study, we&#160; found that the surface components of CsPbI3 were&#160; intrinsically lead&#8208;poor and the relevant traps were&#160; of p&#8208;type with localized states. These deep&#8208;energy&#8208;level p traps induced inferior electrons transfer and serious non&#8208;radiative recombination at CsPbI3/PCBM interface, leading to the considerable opening&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) loss and filling factor (FF) reduction. Compared to molecular passivation, polishing treatment with 1,4&#8208;butanediamine (DAB) could&#160; eliminate the non&#8208;stoichiometric components and root these intrinsically lead&#8208;poor traps for superior electron transfer. The polishing treatment significantly improved the FF and Voc of the inverted CsPbI3 photovoltaics, creating an efficiency promotion from 12.64% to 19.84%. Moreover, 95% of the initial efficiency of the optimized devices was&#160; maintained after the output operation for 1000&#160;h.

Abstract
With the flourishing development of material simulation methods (quantum chemistry methods, molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo, phase field, etc.), extensive adoption of computing technologies (high&#8208;throughput, artificial intelligence, machine learning, etc.), and the invention of high&#8208;performance computing equipment, computational simulation tools have sparked the fundamental mechanism&#8208;level explorations to predict the diverse physicochemical properties and biological effects of biomaterials, and investigate their enormous application potential for disease prevention, diagnostics, and therapeutics. Herein, we propose the term &#8220;computational biomaterials&#8221; and summarize/discuss the computational methods currently used to explore the inherent properties of biomaterials, such as optical, magnetic, electronic, and acoustic properties, and the elucidation of corresponding biological behaviors/effects in the biomedical field. We focus on the theoretical calculation of the physiochemical properties/biological performance of biomaterials applied in disease diagnosis, drug delivery, disease therapeutics, and specific paradigms such as biomimetic biomaterials. Additionally, the biosafety evaluation applications of theoretical simulations of biomaterials are presented. Finally, the challenges and future prospects of such computational simulations for biomaterials development are clarified. It is anticipated that these simulations would offer various methodologies for facilitating and promoting the development and future clinical translations/utilization of versatile biomaterials.

         <title>Tailoring the Thickness&#8208;Dependent Optical Properties of Conducting Nitrides and Oxides for Epsilon&#8208;Near&#8208;Zero&#8208;Enhanced Photonic Applications</title>

Abstract
The unique properties of the emerging photonic materials, conducting nitrides and oxides, especially their tailorability, large damage thresholds, and, importantly, the so&#8208;called epsilon&#8208;near&#8208;zero (ENZ) behavior, have enabled novel photonic phenomena spanning optical circuitry, tunable metasurfaces, and nonlinear optical devices. This work explores direct control of the optical properties of polycrystalline titanium nitride (TiN) and aluminum&#8208;doped zinc oxide (AZO) by tailoring the film thickness, and their potential for ENZ&#8208;enhanced photonic applications. We demonstrate that TiN&#8208;AZO bilayers support Ferrell&#8208;Berreman modes utilizing the thickness&#8208;dependent epsilon&#8208;near&#8208;zero (ENZ) resonances in the AZO films operating in the telecom wavelengths spanning from 1470 to 1750&#160;nm. The bilayer stacks also act as strong light absorbers in the ultraviolet regime employing the radiative ENZ modes and the Fabry&#8208;Perot modes in the constituent TiN films. The studied Berreman resonators exhibit optically&#8208;induced reflectance modulation of 15% with picosecond response&#8208;time. Together with the optical response tailorability of conducting oxides and nitrides, utilizing the field&#8208;enhancement near the tunable ENZ regime could enable a wide range of nonlinear optical phenomena, including all&#8208;optical switching, time refraction, and high&#8208;harmonic generation.

Abstract
The additive manufacturing technique direct laser writing (DLW), also known as two&#8208;photon laser lithography, is becoming increasingly established as a technique capable of fabricating functional three&#8208;dimensional microstructures. Recently, there has been an increasing effort to impart microstructures fabricated using DLW with advanced functionalities by introducing responsive chemical entities into the underpinning photoresists. Herein, we introduce a novel photoresist based on the photochemistry of the bimane group that can be degraded upon exposure to very mild conditions, requiring only water and visible light (&#955;max = 415&#8211;435&#160;nm) irradiation. The degradation of the microstructures was tracked and quantified using AFM measurements of their height. The influence of the writing parameters as well as the degradation conditions was investigated, unambiguously evidencing effective visible light degradation in aqueous environments. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of the photodegradable resist system by incorporating it into multi&#8208;material three&#8208;dimensional microstructures, serving as a model for future applications.

         <title>SrTiO3/CuNi&#8208;Heterostructure&#8208;Based Thermopile for Sensitive Human Radiation Detection and Noncontact Human&#8211;Machine Interaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SrTiO3/CuNi heterostructure&#8208;based thermopile, characterized by the combination of high thermoelectric performance and near&#8208;unity long&#8208;wave infrared absorption, exhibits high sensitivity to human radiation. Further integration of human radiation into a noncontact human&#8211;machine interaction system is experimentally demonstrated, and the real&#8208;time recognition of hand gestures and touchless input of Arabic numbers and English letters are implemented.








Abstract
Noncontact interactive technology provides an intelligent solution to mitigate public health risks from cross&#8208;infection in the era of COVID&#8208;19. The utilization of human radiation as a stimulus source is conducive to the implementation of low&#8208;power, robust noncontact human&#8211;machine interaction. However, the low radiation intensity emitted by humans puts forward a high demand for photodetection performance. Here, a SrTiO3&#8722;x/CuNi&#8208;heterostructure&#8208;based thermopile is constructed, which features the combination of high thermoelectric performance and near&#8208;unity long&#8208;wave infrared absorption, to realize the self&#8208;powered detection of human radiation. The response level of this thermopile to human radiation is orders of magnitude higher than those of low&#8208;dimensional&#8208;materials&#8208;based photothermoelectric detectors and even commercial thermopiles. Furthermore, a touchless input device based on the thermopile array is developed, which can recognize hand gestures, numbers, and letters in real&#8208;time. This work offers a reliable strategy to integrate the spontaneous human radiation into noncontact human&#8211;machine interaction systems.

The response level of this thermopile to human radiation is orders of magnitude higher than those of low-dimensional-materials-based photothermoelectric detectors and even commercial thermopiles. Furthermore, a touchless input device based on the thermopile array is developed, which can recognize hand gestures, numbers, and letters in real-time. This work offers a reliable strategy to integrate the spontaneous human radiation into noncontact human&#8211;machine interaction systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Semicrystalline Conjugated Polymers with Well&#8208;Defined Active Sites for Nitrogen Fixation in a Seawater Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;quasi&#8208;gas&#8211;solid&#8221; interface is well constructed by introducing a suitable semicrystalline structure in donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;based conjugated polymers to significantly boost the nitrogen reduction reaction with a high Faradaic efficiency of 60.5% and a maximum NH3 yield rate of 16.8&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 mg&#8722;1 in a neutral&#8208;buffered seawater electrolyte.








Abstract
Faradaic efficiency for the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is often limited by low N2 solubility in the electrolyte, while a large number of intimate contacts between the electrolyte and solid catalyst can also inevitably sacrifice many active sites for the NRR. Here, it is reported that a &#8220;quasi&#8208;gas&#8211;solid&#8221; interface formed in donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;based conjugated polymers (CPs) is beneficial to boosting the NRR process and at the same time suppressing the competing hydrogen evolution reaction. Of particular interest, it is found that a semicrystalline CP catalyst, SC&#8208;PBDT&#8208;TT, exhibits a high Faradaic efficiency of up to 60.5% with a maximum NH3 production rate of 16.8&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 mg&#8722;1 in a neutral&#8208;buffered seawater electrolyte. Molecular dynamics and COMSOL Multiphysics simulations reveal the origin of the observed high NRR performance arising from the presence of desirable crystal regions to resist the penetration of H2O molecules, leading to the formation of a &#8220;quasi&#8208;gas&#8211;solid&#8221; interface inside the catalyst for a favorable direct&#8208;contact between the catalyst and N2 molecules. Furthermore, high&#8208;throughput computations, based on density functional theory, reveal the actual real active site for N2 adsorption and reduction in SC&#8208;PBDT&#8208;TT. This work provides a new framework for optimizing NRR performance of metal&#8208;free catalysts by controlling their crystallinities.

         <title>Superionic Bifunctional Polymer Electrolytes for Solid&#8208;State Energy Storage and Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superionic bifunctional polymer electrolytes, in which ion relaxation is decoupled from polymer relaxation, are developed to advance electromechanical and electrochemical technologies. Through the formation of intra&#8208;monomer hydrogen bonds between two functional groups, electrostatic interactions of the polymer matrix are effectively weakened to form interconnected rod&#8208;like ion channels in the glassy matrix, thereby accelerating proton transport with a low activation barrier.








Abstract
Achieving superionic conductivity from solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes is an important task in the development of future energy storage and conversion technologies. Herein, a platform for innovative electrolyte technologies based on a bifunctional polymer, poly(3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;4&#8208;sulfonated styrene) (PS&#8208;3H4S), is presented. By incorporating &#63743;OH and &#63743;SO3H functional groups at adjacent positions in the styrene repeating unit, &#8220;intra&#8208;monomer&#8221; hydrogen bonds are formed to effectively weaken the electrostatic interactions of the &#63743;SO3&#8722; moieties in the polymer matrix with embedded ions, promoting rich structural and dynamic heterogeneity in the PS&#8208;3H4S electrolyte. Upon the incorporation of an ionic liquid, interconnected rod&#8208;like ion channels, which allow the decoupling of ion relaxation from polymer relaxation, are formed in the stiff motif of the polymeric domains passivated by interfacial ionic layers. This results in accelerated proton hopping through the glassy polymer matrix, and proton hopping becomes more pronounced at cryogenic temperatures down to &#8722;35 &#176;C. The PS&#8208;3H4S/ionic liquid composite electrolytes exhibit a high ionic conductivity of 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 and high storage modulus of &#8776;100&#160;MPa at 25 &#176;C, and can be successfully applied in soft actuators and lithium&#8208;metal batteries.

         <title>Single&#8208;Crystalline Perovskite p&#8211;n Junction Nanowire Arrays for Ultrasensitive Photodetection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A type of ultrasensitive photodetectors is demonstrated with single&#8208;crystalline perovskite p&#8211;n&#8208;junction nanowire arrays. The high crystallinity of the nanowire arrays enables efficient carrier transport and the formation of the built&#8208;in electric field in the p&#8211;n junction facilitates effective carrier separation. The photodetectors show excellent sensitivity over a wide spectral range from 405 to 635&#160;nm with outstanding responsivities.








Abstract
Highly sensitive photodetectors play significant roles in modern optoelectronic integrated circuits. Constructing p&#8211;n junctions has been proven to be a particularly powerful approach to realizing sensitive photodetection due to their efficient carrier separation. Recently, p&#8211;n&#8208;junction photodetectors based on organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites, which combine favorable optoelectronic performance with facile processability, hold great potential in practical applications. So far, these devices have generally been made of polycrystalline films, which exhibit poor carrier&#8208;transport efficiency, impeding the further improvement of their photoresponsivities. Here, a type of ultrasensitive photodetector based on single&#8208;crystalline perovskite p&#8211;n&#8208;junction nanowire arrays is demonstrated. The single&#8208;crystalline perovskite p&#8211;n&#8208;junction nanowire arrays not only possess high crystallinity that enables efficient carrier transport but also form a built&#8208;in electric field facilitating effective carrier separation. As a result, the devices show excellent photosensitivity over a wide spectral range from 405 to 635&#160;nm with an outstanding responsivity of 2.65&#160;&#215;&#160;102&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1 at 532&#160;nm. These results will provide new insights into the design and construction of high&#8208;performance photodetectors for practical optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Mass Transfer Printing of Metal&#8208;Halide Perovskite Films and Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust transfer&#8208;printing method is developed using an ultrathin chemical bonding interfacial layer. The transfer&#8208;printed perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) exhibit similar performance as optimized spin&#8208;coated LEDs, and the transfer&#8208;printed nanostructure reaches a high resolution up to 1270 ppi. A white perovskite LED structure is finally demonstrated with laterally aligned red and sky&#8208;blue perovskite microstripes made by the multiple transfer&#8208;printing process.








Abstract
Most methods of depositing perovskite films cannot meet the diverse requirements of real applications such as depositing films on various types of substrates, making patterns with different bandgaps for full&#8208;color display. Here, a robust mass transfer method of perovskite films and nanostructures is reported, meeting those requirements, by using an ultrathin branched polyethylenimine as interfacial chemical bonding layers. The transfer&#8208;printed perovskite films exhibit comparable morphology, composition, optoelectronic properties, and device performances with the counterparts made by optimized spin&#8208;coating methods. The perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) using the transfer&#8208;printed films show decent external quantum efficiencies of 10.5% and 6.7% for red (680&#160;nm) and sky&#8208;blue (493&#160;nm) emissions, which are similar to the devices made by spin&#8208;coating. This robust transfer printing method also enables the the preparation of perovskite micropatterns with a high resolution up to 1270 pixels per inch. Horizontally aligned red and sky&#8208;blue perovskite microstripes are further obtained through multiple printing processes for white PeLEDs. This work demonstrates a feasible strategy for making perovskite films or micropatterns on various substrates for real applications in full&#8208;color display, white LEDs, lasing, etc.

         <title>Anode Catalysts in Anion&#8208;Exchange&#8208;Membrane Electrolysis without Supporting Electrolyte: Conductivity, Dynamics, and Ionomer Degradation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To reach the required scale for green hydrogen, it must be produced with efficient, low&#8208;capital&#8208;expense electrolyzers using non&#8208;platinum&#8208;group catalysts. In this work, oxygen&#8208;evolution catalysts in pure&#8208;water anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane water electrolyzer devices are studied. Processes causing device failure are illustrated, nano&#8208;Co3O4 is shown to be a viable catalyst, and design rules for engineering catalyst/ionomer layers with higher performance and durability are proposed.








Abstract
Anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWEs) in principle operate without soluble electrolyte using earth&#8208;abundant catalysts and cell materials and thus lower the cost of green H2. Current systems lack competitive performance and the durability needed for commercialization. One critical issue is a poor understanding of catalyst&#8208;specific degradation processes in the electrolyzer. While non&#8208;platinum&#8208;group&#8208;metal (non&#8208;PGM) oxygen&#8208;evolution catalysts show excellent performance and durability in strongly alkaline electrolyte, this has not transferred directly to pure&#8208;water AEMWEs. Here, AEMWEs with five non&#8208;PGM anode catalysts are built and the catalysts&#8217; structural stability and interactions with the alkaline ionomer are characterized during electrolyzer operation and post&#8208;mortem. The results show catalyst electrical conductivity is one key to obtaining high&#8208;performing systems and that many non&#8208;PGM catalysts restructure during operation. Dynamic Fe sites correlate with enhanced degradation rates, as does the addition of soluble Fe impurities. In contrast, electronically conductive Co3O4 nanoparticles (without Fe in the crystal structure) yield AEMWEs from simple, standard preparation methods, with performance and stability comparable to IrO2. These results reveal the fundamental dynamic catalytic processes resulting in AEMWE device failure under relevant conditions, demonstrate a viable non&#8208;PGM catalyst for AEMWE operation, and illustrate underlying design rules for engineering anode catalyst/ionomer layers with higher performance and durability.

         <title>Halide Perovskite Crystallization Processes and Methods in Nanocrystals, Single Crystals, and Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nucleation process is more thermodynamically difficult by involving a higher surface molecular unit ratio than the growth process of solution&#8208;processed halide perovskite (HP) crystals. Nucleation occurs under a higher supersaturation (C&#160;&gt; Cmin) while growth can occur when C is over Cs. Typical preparation methods for nucleation&#8208;dominated HP nanocrystals, growth&#8208;dominated HP single crystals, and nucleation&#8208;and&#8208;growth&#8208;balanced HP thin films are reviewed.








Abstract
Halide perovskite semiconductors with extraordinary optoelectronic properties have been fascinatedly studied. Halide perovskite nanocrystals, single crystals, and thin films have been prepared for various fields, such as light emission, light detection, and light harvesting. High&#8208;performance devices rely on high crystal quality determined by the nucleation and crystal growth process. Here, the fundamental understanding of the crystallization process driven by supersaturation of the solution is discussed and the methods for halide perovskite crystals are summarized. Supersaturation determines the proportion and the average Gibbs free energy changes for surface and volume molecular units involved in the spontaneous aggregation, which could be stable in the solution and induce homogeneous nucleation only when the solution exceeds a required minimum critical concentration (Cmin). Crystal growth and heterogeneous nucleation are thermodynamically easier than homogeneous nucleation due to the existent surfaces. Nanocrystals are mainly prepared via the nucleation&#8208;dominated process by rapidly increasing the concentration over Cmin, single crystals are mainly prepared via the growth&#8208;dominated process by keeping the concentration between solubility and Cmin, while thin films are mainly prepared by compromising the nucleation and growth processes to ensure compactness and grain sizes. Typical strategies for preparing these three forms of halide perovskites are also reviewed.

         <title>Controlled covalent self&#8208;assembly of a homopolymer for multi&#8208;scale materials engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Polymer self&#8208;assembly is a crucial process in materials engineering. Currently, almost all polymer self&#8208;assembly is limited to non&#8208;covalent bonding methods, even though these methods have drawbacks as they require complicated synthesis techniques and produce relatively unstable structures. Here, a novel mechanism of covalent polymer assembly is discovered and employed to address drawbacks of non&#8208;covalent polymer self&#8208;assembly. A simple ketone homopolymer is found to self&#8208;assembly into nano&#8208; to macro&#8208;scale hydrogels during covalent crosslinking. In contrast to non&#8208;covalent self&#8208;assembly, the covalent assembly is independent of and unaffected by solvent conditions (e.g., polarity and ionic strength) and does not require additional agents, e.g., organic solvents and surfactants. The covalent polymer self&#8208;assembly is subject to a new mechanism of control by tuning the covalent crosslinking rate. This leads to nanogels with an unprecedented and tightly controlled range of dimensions from less than 10&#160;nm to above 100&#160;nm. Moreover, the crosslinking rate also regulates the assembly behavior of microgels fabricated by microfluidics. The microgels self&#8208;assemble into granular fibers, which is 3D printed into stable porous scaffolds. The novel covalent polymer assembly method has enormous potential to revolutionize multi&#8208;scale materials fabrication for applications in drug delivery, tissue engineering, and many other fields.

         <title>Tungsten&#8208;based Nanomaterials in the Biomedical Field: A Bibliometric Analysis of Research Progress and Prospects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Tungsten&#8208;based nanomaterials (TNMs) with diverse nanostructures and unique physicochemical properties have been widely applied in the biomedical field. Although various reviews have described the application of TNMs in specific biomedical fields, there are still no comprehensive studies that summarize and analyze research trends of the field as a whole. To identify and further promote the development of biomedical TNMs, a bibliometric analysis method was used to analyze all relevant literature on this topic. First, general bibliometric distributions of the dataset by year, country, institute, referenced source and research hotspots are recognized. Next, we provide a comprehensive review of the subjectively recognized research hotspots in various biomedical fields, including biological sensing, anticancer treatments, antibacterials, and toxicity evaluation. Finally, the prospects and challenges of TNMs are discussed to provide a new perspective for further promoting their development in biomedical research.

         <title>Chemical vapor deposition of high optical quality large area monolayer Janus transition metal dichalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
We report one pot chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth of large area Janus SeMoS monolayers, with the asymmetric top (Se) and bottom (S) chalcogen atomic planes with respect to the central transition metal (Mo) atoms. The formation of these two&#8208;dimensional semiconductor monolayers takes place upon the thermodynamic equilibrium driven exchange of the bottom Se atoms of the initially grown MoSe2 single crystals on gold foils with S atoms. The growth process is characterized by complementary experimental techniques including Raman and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy and the growth mechanisms are rationalized by first principal calculations. The remarkably high optical quality of the synthesized Janus monolayers is demonstrated by optical and magneto&#8208;optical measurements which reveal the strong exciton&#8208;phonon coupling and enable to obtain the exciton g&#8208;factor of &#8208;3.3.

         <title>Enriched&#8208;bromine surface state for stable sky&#8208;blue spectrum perovskite QLEDs with an EQE of 14.6%</title>

Abstract
Halogen vacancies are of great concern in blue&#8208;emitting perovskite quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes because they affect their efficiency and spectral shift. Here, the enriched&#8208;bromine surface state is realised using a facile strategy that employs a PbBr2 stock solution for anion exchange based on Cd&#8208;doped perovskite quantum dots. We find that the doped Cd ions are expected to reduce the formation energy of halogen vacancies filled by the external bromine ions, and the excess free bromine ions in solution are enriched in the surface by anchoring with halogen vacancies as sites, accompanied with the shedding of surface long&#8208;chain ligands during the anion exchange process, resulting in a Br&#8208;rich and &#8220;neat&#8221; surface. Moreover, the surface state exhibits good passivation of the surface defects of the controlled perovskite QDs and simultaneously increases the exciton binding energy, leading to excellent optical properties and stability. Finally, the sky&#8208;blue emitting perovskite QLEDs (490&#160;nm) are conducted with a record external quantum efficiency of 14.6% and current efficiency of 19.9&#160;cd/A. Meanwhile, the electroluminescence spectra exhibit great stability with negligible shifts under a constant operating voltage from 3 to 7&#160;V. This strategy paves the way for improving the efficiency and stability of perovskite QLEDs.

         <title>Vapor&#8208;Assisted In Situ Recrystallization for Efficient Tin&#8208;Based Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Tin&#8208;based perovskites are promising candidates to replace their toxic lead&#8208;based counterparts in optoelectronic applications, such as light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). However, the development of tin perovskite LEDs is slow due to the challenge of obtaining high quality tin perovskite films. Here, a vapor&#8208;assisted spin&#8208;coating (VASC) method is developed to achieve high quality tin perovskites and high efficiency LEDs. It is revealed that solvent vapor can lead to in situ recrystallization of tin perovskites during the film formation process, thus significantly improving the crystalline quality with reduced defects. An antioxidant additive is further introduced to suppress the oxidation of Sn2+ and increase the photoluminescence quantum efficiency up to &#8764;30%, which is an &#8764;4&#8208;fold enhancement in comparison with that of the control method. As a result, efficient tin perovskite LEDs are achieved with a peak external quantum efficiency of 5.3%, which is among the highest efficiency of lead&#8208;free perovskite LEDs.

         <title>Step&#8208;climbing Epitaxy of Layered Materials with Giant Out&#8208;of&#8208;plane Lattice Mismatch</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Heteroepitaxy with large lattice mismatch remains a great challenge for high&#8208;quality epifilm growth. Although great efforts have been devoted to epifilm growth with an in&#8208;plane lattice mismatch, the epitaxy of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) layered crystals on stepped substrates with a giant out&#8208;of&#8208;plane lattice mismatch is seldom reported. Here, taking the molecular beam epitaxy of 2D semiconducting Bi2O2Se on three&#8208;dimensional SrTiO3 substrates as an example, we propose a step&#8208;climbing epitaxy growth strategy, in which the nth (n = 1, 2, 3&#8230;) epilayer climbs the step with height difference from out&#8208;of&#8208;plane lattice mismatch and continues to grow the n+1th epilayer. Step&#8208;climbing epitaxy can spontaneously relax and release the strain from the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane lattice mismatch, which ensures the high quality of large&#8208;area epitaxial films. Wafer&#8208;scale uniform 2D Bi2O2Se single&#8208;crystal films with controllable thickness can be obtained via step&#8208;climbing epitaxy. Most notably, one&#8208;unit&#8208;cell Bi2O2Se films (1.2&#160;nm thick) exhibit a high Hall mobility of 180 cm2/Vs at room temperature, which exceeds that of silicon and other 2D semiconductors with comparable thickness. As an out&#8208;of&#8208;plane lattice mismatch is generally present in the epitaxy of layered materials, the step&#8208;climbing epitaxy strategy expands the existing epitaxial growth theory and provides guidance toward the high&#8208;quality synthesis of layered materials.

&lt;p&gt;Heteroepitaxy with large lattice mismatch remains a great challenge for high-quality epifilm growth. Although great efforts have been devoted to epifilm growth with an in-plane lattice mismatch, the epitaxy of two-dimensional (2D) layered crystals on stepped substrates with a giant out-of-plane lattice mismatch is seldom reported.

         <title>Why it is Unfortunate that Linear Machine Learning Models &#8220;Work&#8221; so well in Electromechanical Switching of Ferroelectric Thin Films</title>

Abstract
Machine learning is increasingly relied on to extract physical information from materials spectroscopy. Unfortunately, it is challenging to make machine learning models fail because statistical correlations can mimic the physics without understanding the data or causality. Here, using a benchmark band&#8208;excitation piezoresponse force microscopy polarization spectroscopy (BEPS) dataset openly published by the Authors in 2017, we demonstrate and overcome common pitfalls of so&#8208;called &#8220;better,&#8221; &#8220;faster,&#8221; and &#8220;less biased&#8221; machine&#8208;learning&#8208;based discovery of electromechanical switching. Using a toy and real experimental dataset, we demonstrate how the application of linear non&#8208;temporal machine learning methods to multimodal hyperspectral data results in physically reasonable embedding (eigenvalues) while producing non&#8208;sensical eigenvectors and generated spectra promoting misleading interpretations. We demonstrate, through rigorous validation, a new method of unsupervised multimodal hyperspectral analysis of BEPS using a long&#8208;short term memory (LSTM) &#946;&#8208;variational autoencoders (&#946;VAE) that is adapted to the experiments information content. By including recurrent LSTM neurons, we consider the ordinal nature of ferroelectric switching. To improve the interpretability of the latent space, we impose a variational Kullback&#8211;Leibler (KL)&#8208;divergency regularization term to the loss function. Finally, we leverage regularization scheduling of &#946; as a disentanglement metric to reduce user bias. Combining these experiment&#8208;inspired modifications enables the automated detection of various ferroelectric switching mechanisms, including a complex two&#8208;step, three&#8208;state ferroelastic switching mechanism. Ultimately, this work provides a robust machine learning methodology for the rapid discovery of electromechanically switching mechanisms in ferroelectrics and is applicable to other multimodal hyperspectral materials spectroscopies.

         <title>Supramolecular Nitric Oxide Depot for Hypoxic Tumor Vessel Normalization and Radiosensitization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In cancer radiotherapy, the lack of fixed DNA damages by oxygen in hypoxic microenvironment of solid tumors often lead to severe radioresistance. Nitric oxide (NO) is a potent radiosensitizer that acts in two ways. It can directly react with the radical DNA thus fixes the damage. It also normalizes the abnormal tumor vessels, thereby increasing blood perfusion and oxygen supply. To achieve these functions, the dosage and duration of NO treatment need to be carefully controlled, otherwise it would lead to the exact opposite outcomes. However, a delivery method that fulfills both requirements is still lacking. We designed a NO depot for the control of NO releasing both over quantity and duration for hypoxic tumor vessel normalization and radiosensitization. In B16 tumor&#8208;bearing mice, the depot could provide low dosage NO continuously and release large amount of NO immediately before irradiation for a short period of time. These two modes of treatment worked in synergy to reverse the radioresistance of B16 tumor more efficiently than releasing at single dosage.

         <title>Highly Orientated Perovskite Quantum Dot Solids for Efficient Solar Cells</title>

Abstract
Perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) emerge as competitive optoelectronic materials for photovoltaic applications due to their ideal bandgap energy, high defect tolerance and solution processability. However, the highly dynamic surface and unperfect cubic structure of PQDs generally result in unfavorable charge carrier transport within the PQD solids and serious nonradiative recombination. Herein, the highly orientated PQD solid is demonstrated using precursor engineering accompanied by a chemical stripping treatment (CST). A combination of systematically experimental studies and theoretical calculations is conducted to fundamentally understand the resurfacing of PQDs using the CST approach. The results reveal that highly ordered PQDs could result in a high orientation of PQD solids, significantly promoting the charge carrier transport within the PQD solids. Meanwhile, the ideal cubic&#8208;structured PQD with an iodine&#8208;rich surface dramatically decreases surface trap states, thereby substantially diminishing trap&#8208;assisted nonradiative recombination. Consequently, the inorganic PQD solar cell (PQDSC) delivers a power conversion efficiency of up to 16.25%. This work provides a feasible avenue to construct highly orientated PQD solids with improved photophysical properties for high&#8208;performance optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Ultrathin Suspended Chiral Metasurfaces for Enantio&#8208;discrimination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Chiral metasurfaces can exhibit a strong circular dichroism, but it is limited by the complicated fabrication procedure and alignment errors. Here, we demonstrate a new type of self&#8208;aligned suspended chiral bilayer metasurface with only one&#8208;step electron beam lithography exposure. A significant optical chirality of 221&#176;/&#956;m can be realized using suspended metasurfaces with a thickness of 100&#160;nm. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate that such a structure is capable of label&#8208;free discrimination of the chiral molecules at zeptomole level, exhibiting a much higher sensitivity (orders of magnitude) compared to the conventional circular dichroism spectroscopy. The fundamental principles for chiral sensing using molecules&#8210;metasurfaces interactions have been explored. Benefiting from the giant chiroptical response, our proposed meta&#8208;device may offer promising applications for ultrathin circular polarizers, chiral molecular detectors, and asymmetry information processing.

         <title>Self&#8208;Healing and Light&#8208;Soaking in MAPbI3: The Effect of H2O</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The two&#8208;photon&#8208;induced photodamage and consequent self&#8208;healing inside MAPbI3 single crystals are investigated. Two photobrightening and one photodarkening process are identified,&#160;which&#160;are connected to trap&#8208;filling, methylamine&#8208;chemistry, and the lead&#8208;halide sublattice. H2O is&#160;found&#160;to&#160;strongly influence the overall photodamage and kinetics of the self&#8208;healing process, showing an important connection between self&#8208;healing and the presence of H2O. 








Abstract
The future of halide perovskites (HaPs) is beclouded by limited understanding of their long&#8208;term stability. While HaPs can be altered by radiation that induces multiple processes, they can also return to their original state by &#8220;self&#8208;healing.&#8221; Here two&#8208;photon (2P) absorption is used to effect light&#8208;induced modifications within MAPbI3 single crystals. Then the changes in the photodamaged region are followed by measuring the photoluminescence, from 2P absorption with 2.5&#160;orders of magnitude lower intensity than that used for photodamaging the MAPbI3. After photodamage, two brightening and one darkening process are found, all of which recover but on different timescales. The first two are attributed to trap&#8208;filling (the fastest) and to proton&#8208;amine&#8208;related chemistry (the slowest), while photodamage is attributed to the lead&#8208;iodide sublattice. Surprisingly, while after 2P&#8208;irradiation of crystals that are stored in dry, inert ambient, photobrightening (or &#8220;light&#8208;soaking&#8221;) occurs, mostly photodarkening is seen after photodamage in humid ambient, showing an important connection between the self&#8208;healing of a HaP and the presence of H2O, for long&#8208;term steady&#8208;state illumination, practically no difference remains between samples kept in dry or humid environments. This result suggests that photobrightening requires a chemical&#8208;reservoir that is sensitive to the presence of H2O, or possibly other proton&#8208;related, particularly amine, chemistry.

         <title>Experimental Realization of Atomic Monolayer Si9C15</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D Si9C15 monolayer is fabricated on Ru (0001) and Rh(111) substrates via the reaction between Si and graphene under high temperatures. The as&#8208;grown Si9C15 layer is micrometer&#8208;scale, high quality, and single crystalline with a bandgap of &#8776;1.9 eV. Combined measurements and density functional calculations confirm the buckled honeycomb structure. The novel 2D material also shows good air stability.








Abstract
Monolayer SixCy constitutes an important family of&#160;2D&#160;materials that is predicted to feature a honeycomb structure and appreciable bandgaps. However, due to its binary chemical nature and the lack of bulk polymorphs with a layered structure, the fabrication of such materials has so far been challenging. Here, the synthesis of atomic monolayer Si9C15 on Ru (0001) and Rh(111) substrates is reported. A combination of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations is used to infer that the 2D lattice of Si9C15 is a buckled honeycomb structure. Monolayer Si9C15 shows semiconducting behavior with a bandgap of &#8776;1.9&#160;eV. Remarkably, the Si9C15 lattice remains intact after exposure to ambient conditions, indicating good air stability. The present work expands the 2D&#8208;materials library and provides a promising platform for future studies in nanoelectronics and nanophotonics.

         <title>Volatile Organic Compound Sensing Array and Optoelectronic Filter System using Ion&#8208;Pairing Dyes with a Wide Visible Spectrum</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A brief methodology to synthesize sensing materials (e.g., ion&#8208;paring dyes) with hydrophobicity, ease of color tunability, and a wide visible spectrum is suggested. This can simplify the sensing array, thereby producing a color map distinguishing functional groups as well as carbon chain lengths. The ion&#8208;pairing dyes will be extended to the electronic system promising the safety and health of the user.








Abstract
An ideal dye&#8208;based sensing array has essential design requirements, including facile preparation methodology, tolerance to water vapor, a broad range of color&#8208;responsive changes, and a simple readout system. Here, a brief synthetic route is developed for ion&#8208;pairing dyes exhibiting unusual chromatic changes across the entire visible spectrum. It requires only mixing and precipitation under mild conditions. The dyes are applied to a sensing array containing 12 sensing elements with different initial states. Owing to the numerous color variations of the dyes, the color map generated by the array is highly simple yet sufficiently accurate to distinguish among the different functional groups (such as amines, aldehydes, and carboxylic acids) as well as carbon chain lengths. Principle component analysis (PCA) demonstrates that volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can be well classified according to the color changes of the sensing array. The ion&#8208;pairing dyes are embedded into&#160;3D&#160;stacked nanofibers via electrospinning, and function as effective harmful&#8208;gas (e.g., formaldehyde) sensors with sub&#8208;ppm theoretical detection limits (0.15&#160;ppm). Finally, the 3D stacked nanofibers can be employed in an optoelectronic filter system that automatically checks for formaldehyde in the surroundings and also confirms the effective removal of the detected formaldehyde by the gas filter cartridge.

         <title>Exposing Single Ni Atoms in Hollow S/N&#8208;Doped Carbon Macroporous Fibers for Highly Efficient Electrochemical Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni single atoms embedded S/N&#8208;doped carbon macroporous fibers (Ni SAs@S/N&#8208;CMF) are fabricated through pyrolysis of rationally designed CdS&#8208;NiSx@PAN composite fibers. Benefiting from the abundant exposed single Ni atoms and hollow macroporous structure, the resultant Ni SAs@S/N&#8208;CMF electrocatalyst exhibits outstanding activity and stability for the oxygen evolution reaction.








Abstract
The development of efficient and cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is highly desirable for clean energy and fuel conversion. Herein, the facile preparation of Ni single atoms embedded hollow S/N&#8208;doped carbon macroporous fibers (Ni SAs@S/N&#8208;CMF) as efficient catalysts for OER through pyrolysis of designed CdS&#8208;NiSx/polyacrylonitrile composite fibers is reported. Specifically, CdS provides the sulfur source for the doping of polyacrylonitrile&#8208;derived carbon matrix and simultaneously creates the hollow macroporous structure, while NiSx is first reduced to nanoparticles and finally evolves into single Ni atoms through the atom migration&#8208;trapping strategy. Benefiting from the abundantly exposed single Ni atoms and hollow macroporous structure, the resultant Ni SAs@S/N&#8208;CMF electrocatalysts deliver outstanding activity and stability for OER. Specifically, it needs an overpotential of 285&#160;mV to achieve the benchmark current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with a small Tafel slope of 50.8&#160;mV dec&#8722;1.

         <title>Electroconductive, Adhesive, Non&#8208;Swelling, and Viscoelastic Hydrogels for Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new conductive hydrogel is developed through the simultaneous exfoliation of graphite and polymerization of zwitterionic monomers triggered by microwave irradiation. This hydrogel demonstrates tissue&#8208;like extraneuronal electrodes satisfying requirements of bioelectronics such as low storage modulus, high viscoelasticity, low toxicity, reliable adhesion, and conformability to biological tissues, and maintenance of conductivity and hydrogel volume in wet environments.








Abstract
As a new class of materials, implantable flexible electrical conductors have recently been developed and applied to bioelectronics. An ideal electrical conductor requires high conductivity, tissue&#8208;like mechanical properties, low toxicity, reliable adhesion to biological tissues, and the ability to maintain its shape in wet physiological environments. Despite significant advances, electrical conductors that satisfy all these requirements are insufficient. Herein, a facile method for manufacturing a new conductive hydrogels through the simultaneous exfoliation of graphite and polymerization of zwitterionic monomers triggered by microwave irradiation is introduced. The mechanical properties of the obtained conductive hydrogel are similar to those of living tissue, which is ideal as a bionic adhesive for minimizing contact damage due to mechanical mismatches between hard electronics and soft tissues. Furthermore, it exhibits excellent adhesion performance, electrical conductivity, non&#8208;swelling, and high conformability in water. Excellent biocompatibility of the hydrogel is confirmed through a cytotoxicity test using C2C12 cells, a biocompatibility test on rat tissues, and their histological analysis. The hydrogel is then implanted into the sciatic nerve of a rat and neuromodulation is demonstrated through low&#8208;current electrical stimulation. This hydrogel demonstrates a tissue&#8208;like extraneuronal electrode, which possesses high conformability to improve the tissue&#8211;electronics interfaces, promising next&#8208;generation bioelectronics applications.

         <title>Emergent Magnetic Fan Structures in Manganite Homojunction Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Manganese oxide homojunctions with gradually modulated doping level host surprisingly complex, long&#8208;range ordered magnetic superstructures whose spin alignment is tunable by low magnetic fields. Homojunctions can thus serve as a powerful design element of all&#8208;oxide spintronic devices.








Abstract
Devices with tunable magnetic noncollinearity are important components of superconducting electronics and spintronics, but they typically require epitaxial integration of several complex materials. The spin&#8208;polarized neutron reflectometry measurements on La1&#8722;xSrxMnO3 homojunction arrays with modulated Sr concentration reported herein have led to the discovery of magnetic fan structures with highly noncollinear alignment of Mn spins and an emergent periodicity twice as large as the array's unit cell. The neutron data show that these magnetic superstructures can be fully long&#8208;range ordered, despite the gradual modulation of the doping level created by charge transfer and chemical intermixing. The degree of noncollinearity can be effectively adjusted by low magnetic fields. Notwithstanding their chemical and structural simplicity, oxide homojunctions thus show considerable promise as a platform for tunable complex magnetism and as a powerful design element of spintronic&#160;devices.

         <title>In&#8208;situ Growth of Covalent Organic Framework Nanosheets on Graphene as Cathode for Long&#8208;life High&#8208;capacity Lithium&#8208;ion Battery</title>

Abstract
Poor electronic and ionic conductivities of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) severely restrict the development of COF&#8208;based electrodes for practical rechargeable batteries, therefore inspiring more research interests from the direction of both material synthesis and technology. Herein, a dual&#8208;porous COF, USTB&#8208;6, with good crystallinity and rich redox&#8208;active sites has been conceived and reticulated by the polymerization of 2,3,8,9,14,15&#8208;hexa(4&#8208;formylphenyl)diquinoxalino [2,3&#8208;a:2,3&#8208;c]phenazine and 2,7&#8208;diaminopyrene&#8208;4,5,9,10&#8208;tetraone. In particular, the graphene&#8208;participated heterogeneous polymerization of the same starting materials affords the uniformly dispersed COF nanosheets with the thickness of 8.3&#160;nm on the conductive carbon substrate, effectively enhancing the electronic conductivity of COF&#8208;based electrode. Such graphene&#8208;supported USTB&#8208;6 nanosheets cathode used in lithium&#8208;ion battery exhibits a specific capacity of 285&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at current density of 0.2 C and excellent rate performance with the still prominent capacity of 188&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 10 C. More importantly, a capacity of 170&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 is retained by USTB&#8208;6 nanosheets cathode after 6000 cycles change and discharge measurement at 5 C.

         <title>Wireless Stand&#8208;alone Trimodal Interactive Display Enabled by Direct Capacitive Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
With recent advances in interactive displays, the development of a stand&#8208;alone interactive display with no electrical interconnection is of great interest. Here, we present a wireless stand&#8208;alone interactive display (WiSID), enabled by direct capacitive coupling, consisting of three layers: two in&#8208;plane metal electrodes separated by a gap, a composite layer for field&#8208;induced electroluminescence (EL) and inverse piezoelectric sound, and a stimuli&#8208;responsive layer, from bottom to top. Alternating current (AC) power necessary for field&#8208;induced EL and inverse piezoelectric sound is wirelessly transferred from a power unit, with two in&#8208;plane electrodes remotely separated from the WiSID. The unique in&#8208;plane power transfer through the stimuli&#8208;sensitive polar bridge allows stand&#8208;alone operation of the WiSID, making it suitable for the wireless dynamic monitoring of medical fluids. Moreover, we demonstrate a haptic wireless stand&#8208;alone trimodal interactive display mounted on a human finger, whereby touch is wirelessly displayed in various outputs of EL, inverse piezoelectric sound, and tactile vibration, making it suitable for a wireless three&#8208;mode smart braille display.

Abstract
Metal&#8208;sulfur (M&#8208;S) batteries are promising energy storage devices due to their advantages such as the large energy density, low cost of the raw materials. However, M&#8208;S batteries suffer from many drawbacks. Endowing the electrodes and electrolytes with the proper catalytic activity is crucial to improve the electrochemical properties of M&#8208;S batteries. With regard to the S cathodes, advanced electrode materials with enhanced electrocatalytic effects can capture polysulfides and accelerate electrochemical conversion and as for the metal anodes, the proper electrode materials can provide active sites for metal deposition to reduce the deposition potential barrier and control the electroplating or stripping process. Moreover, an advanced electrolyte with the desirable design can catalyze the electrochemical reactions on the cathode and anode in high&#8208;performance M&#8208;S batteries. In this review, recent progress pertaining to the design of advanced electrode materials and electrolytes with the proper catalytic effects is summarized. The current progress of S cathodes and metal anodes in different types of M&#8208;S batteries are discussed and future development directions are described. Our objective is to provide a comprehensive review on the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art S cathodes and metal anodes in M&#8208;S batteries and research guidance for future development of this important class of batteries.

         <title>Shaping 90 wt% NanoMOFs into Robust Multifunctional Aerogels Using Tailored Bio&#8208;based Nanofibrils</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are hybrid porous crystalline networks with tunable chemical and structural properties. However, their excellent potential is limited in practical applications due to their hard&#8208;to&#8208;shape powder form, making it challenging to assemble MOFs into macroscopic composites with mechanical integrity. While a binder matrix enables hybrid materials, such materials have a limited MOF content and thus limited functionality. To overcome this challenge, nanoMOFs are combined with tailored same&#8208;charge high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) to manufacture robust, wet&#8208;stable, and multifunctional MOF&#8208;based aerogels with 90 wt% nanoMOF loading. The porous aerogel architectures show excellent potential for practical applications such as efficient water purification, CO2 and CH4 gas adsorption and separation, and fire&#8208;safe insulation. Moreover, a one&#8208;step carbonization process enables these aerogels as effective structural energy&#8208;storage electrodes. This work exhibits the unique ability of high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio CNFs to bind large amounts of nanoMOFs in structured materials with outstanding mechanical integrity &#8211; a quality that is preserved even after carbonization. The demonstrated process is simple and fully discloses the intrinsic potential of the nanoMOFs, resulting in synergetic properties not found in the components alone, thus paving the way for MOFs in macroscopic multifunctional composites.

         <title>A Novel &#8730;19&#215;&#8730;19 Superstructure in Epitaxially Grown 1T&#8208;TaTe2</title>

Abstract
The spontaneous formation of electronic orders is a crucial element for understanding complex quantum states and engineering heterostructures in two&#8208;dimensional materials. We report a novel &#8730;19&#215;&#8730;19 charge order in few&#8208;layer thick 1T&#8208;TaTe2 transition metal dichalcogenide films grown by molecular beam epitaxy, which has not been realized. Our photoemission and scanning probe measurements demonstrate that monolayer 1T&#8208;TaTe2 exhibits a variety of metastable charge density wave orders, including the &#8730;19&#215;&#8730;19 superstructure, which can be selectively stabilized by controlling the post&#8208;growth annealing temperature. Moreover, we find that only the &#8730;19&#215;&#8730;19 order persists in 1T&#8208;TaTe2 films thicker than a monolayer, up to 8 layers. Our findings identify the previously unrealized novel electronic order in a much&#8208;studied transition metal dichalcogenide and provide a viable route to control it within the epitaxial growth process.

         <title>Preparation of 2D Molybdenum Phosphide via Surface&#8208;Confined Atomic Substitution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonlayered molybdenum phosphide (MoP) with well&#8208;defined 2D morphology and tunable crystallinity can be prepared from layered molybdenum dichalcogenides via surface&#8208;confined atomic substitution. In contrast to the well&#8208;documented edge&#8208;dominated electrocatalytic performance of the MoS2 precusor, the entire basal plane of MoP demonstrates satisfying electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction performance owing to its coordination&#8208;unsaturated surface atoms with abundant dangling bonds.








Abstract
The emerging nonlayered 2D materials (NL2DMs) are sparking immense interest due to their fascinating physicochemical properties and enhanced performance in many applications. NL2DMs are particularly favored in catalytic applications owing to the extremely large surface area and low&#8208;coordinated surface atoms. However, the synthesis of NL2DMs is complex because their crystals are held together by strong isotropic covalent bonds. Here, nonlayered molybdenum phosphide (MoP) with well&#8208;defined 2D morphology is synthesized from layered molybdenum dichalcogenides via surface&#8208;confined atomic substitution. During the synthesis, the molybdenum dichalcogenide nanosheet&#160;functions as the host matrix where each layer of Mo maintains their hexagonal arrangement and forms isotropic covalent bonds with P that substitutes S, resulting in the conversion from layered van der Waals material to a covalently bonded NL2DM. The MoP nanosheets converted from few&#8208;layer MoS2 are single crystalline, while those converted from monolayers are amorphous. The converted MoP demonstrates metallic charge transport and desirable performance in the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). More importantly, in contrast to MoS2, which shows edge&#8208;dominated HER performance, the edge and basal plane of MoP deliver similar HER performance, which is correlated with theoretical calculations. This work provides a new synthetic strategy for high&#8208;quality nonlayered materials with well&#8208;defined 2D morphology for future exploration.

         <title>In Situ Characterization of the Protein Corona of Nanoparticles in vitro and in vivo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Here, we propose a new theoretical framework that enables the use of Differential Dynamic Microscopy (DDM) in fluorescence imaging mode to quantify in situ protein adsorption onto nanoparticles (NP) while simultaneously monitoring for NP aggregation. We use this methodology to elucidate the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the protein corona (PC) in vitro and in vivo. Our results show that protein adsorption triggers particle aggregation over a wide concentration range and that the formed aggregate structures can be quantified using the proposed methodology. Protein affinity for polystyrene (PS) NPs was observed to be dependent on particle concentration. For complex protein mixtures, our methodology identifies that the PC composition changes with the dilution of serum proteins, demonstrating a Vroman effect never quantitatively assessed in situ on NPs. Finally, DDM allows monitoring of the evolution of the PC in vivo. Our results show that the PC composition evolves significantly over time in zebrafish larvae, confirming the inherently dynamic nature of the PC. The performance of the developed methodology allowed to obtain quantitative insights into nano&#8208;bio interactions in a vast array of physiologically relevant conditions that will serve to further improve the design of nanomedicine.

The irregular and random zinc electrodeposition has emerged as a nonnegligible barrier for deeply rechargeable aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs), yet traditional texture regulation of Zn substrate cannot continuously induce uniform Zn deposition. Here, a Janus separator was constructed via parallelly grown the graphene sheets modified with sulfonic cellulose on one side of the commercial glass fiber separator throughout spin&#8208;coating technique. The Janus separator could consistently regulate Zn growth toward a locked crystallographic orientation of Zn(002) texture to intercept dendrites. Furthermore, the separator can spontaneously repel SO42&#8211; and anchor H+ while allowing effective transport of Zn2+ to alleviate side reactions. Accordingly, the Zn symmetric cell harvests a long&#8208;term lifespan over 1400&#160;h at 10&#160;mA cm&#8211;2/10 mAh cm&#8211;2 and endures stable cycling over 220&#160;h even at a high DOD of 56%. The Zn/CNT&#8208;MnO2 cell achieves an outstanding capacity retention of 95% at 1 A g&#8211;1 after 1900 cycles. Furthermore, the Zn/NH4V4O10 pouch cell with Janus separator delivers an initial capacity of 178 mAh g&#8211;1 and a high capacity retention of 87.4% after 260 cycles. This work provides a continuous regulation approach to achieve crystallographic homogeneity of Zn anode, which could be suitable to other metal batteries.

         <title>Unlock Layered Double Hydroxide as a High Performance Cathode Material for Aqueous Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Advanced cathode materials play an important role in promoting aqueous battery technology for safe energy storage. Transition metal double hydroxides are usually elusive as a stable cathode for aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs) due to their unstable crystal structure, sluggish ion transportation and insufficient active sites for zinc ion storage. Here we report a trinary layered double hydroxide with hydrogen vacancies (Ni3Mn0.7Fe0.3&#8208;LDH) as a new cathode material for AZIBs. A reversible high capacity up to 328 mAh g&#8722;1 can be obtained and cycle stably over 500 cycles with a capacity retention of 85%. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the hydrogen vacancies in LDH could expose lattice oxygen atoms as active sites for zinc ion storage and accelerate ion diffusion by reducing the electrostatic interactions between zinc ions and the host structure. Besides, the synergy of trinary transitional metal cations can suppress the Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion of manganese (III) oxide octahedron and enable long cycle stability. This work provides not only a series of high performance cathode materials for aqueous zinc ion batteries but also a novel materials design strategy that can be extended to other multi&#8208;valence metal ion batteries.

         <title>Visible Light Curable Acrylic Resins Toward UV&#8208;light Blocking Adhesives for Foldable Displays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Current technological advances in the organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) panel design of foldable smartphones demand advanced adhesives with UV&#8208;blocking abilities, beyond their conventional roles of bonding objects and relieving deformation stress. However, optically clear adhesives (OCAs) with UV&#8208;blocking ability cannot be prepared using conventional UV&#8208;curing methods relying on a photoinitiator. Herein, we present a new acrylic resin that can be efficiently cured using visible light without oxygen removal, which may be used to develop UV&#8208;blocking OCAs for use in current flexible displays. A novel photocatalyst and a specific combination of additives facilitate sufficiently rapid curing under visible light in the presence of UV absorbers. Only a very small amount of the highly active photocatalyst is required to prepare UV&#8208;blocking OCA films with very high transparency in the visible region. Using this system, a UV&#8208;blocking OCA that nearly meets the specifications of an OCA used in commercialized foldable smartphones is realized. This technology could also be utilized in other applications that require highly efficient visible&#8208;light curing, such as optically clear resins, dental resins, and 3D/4D&#8208;printable materials.

         <title>Rapid Ultratough Topological Tissue Adhesives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tissue adhesives capable of achieving tough adhesion in wet environments are useful in many biomedical applications. It is shown that combining pH&#8208;responsive bridging chitosan polymer chains and a tough hydrogel dissipative matrix can achieve ultratough adhesion to tissues (&gt;2000 J m&#8722;2) without covalent bond formation. These properties open opportunities for new strategies in the development of non&#8208;covalent tissue adhesives.








Abstract
Tissue adhesives capable of achieving strong and tough adhesion in permeable wet environments are useful in many biomedical applications. However, adhesion generated through covalent bond formation directly with the functional groups of tissues (i.e., &#63743;COOH and &#63743;NH2&#160;groups in collagen), or using non&#8208;covalent interactions can both be limited by weak, unstable, or slow adhesion. Here, it is shown that by combining pH&#8208;responsive bridging chitosan polymer chains and a tough hydrogel dissipative matrix one can achieve unprecedented ultratough adhesion to tissues (&gt;2000&#160;J&#160;m&#8722;2) in 5&#8211;10&#160;min without covalent bond formation. The strong non&#8208;covalent adhesion is shown to be stable under physiologically relevant conditions and strongly influenced by chitosan molecular weight, molecular weight of polymers in the matrix, and pH. The adhesion mechanism relies primarily on the topological entanglement between the chitosan chains and the permeable adherends. To further expand the applicability of the adhesives, adhesion time can be decreased by dehydrating the hydrogel matrix to facilitate rapid chitosan interpenetration and entanglement (&gt;1000&#160;J&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;in &#8804;1&#160;min). The unprecedented adhesive properties presented in this study open opportunities for new strategies in the development of non&#8208;covalent tissue adhesives and numerous bioapplications.

         <dc:description>
Liquid metals (LMs) with good biosafety, deformability, functionalizability, and stimulus responsiveness have great potential in biomedicine. Here, the advantages of LMs are presented. Recent advances in the design and application of LM&#8208;based biomaterials are comprehensively summarized to provide deep insights into structure&#8211;property relationships and guide their on&#8208;demand design and performance optimization for therapeutics, bioimaging, biosensors, and tissue repair.








Abstract

         <title>Data&#8208;Driven Materials Innovation and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent advances, strategies, insights, and challenges of data&#8208;driven&#8208;based innovations and applications in material science are discussed. Essential subdisciplines, including framework, machine&#8208;learning algorithms, available chemical databases, commonly used key descriptors, and innovations and applications based on their synergy, are reviewed.








Abstract
Owing to the rapid developments to improve the accuracy and efficiency of both experimental and computational investigative methodologies, the massive amounts of data generated have led the field of materials science into the fourth paradigm of data&#8208;driven scientific research.

         <title>Multimode Electron Tomography Sheds Light on Synthesis, Structure, and Properties of Complex Metal&#8208;Based Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advanced 3D characterization techniques for complex metal&#8208;based nanomaterials by multimode electron tomography are reviewed. Advancements in data acquisition and processing are discussed, in addition to case studies of complex nanomaterials where morphology, elemental distribution, and oxidation states must be understood in 3D to gain crucial insights and drive future design and synthesis of complex nanosystems.








Abstract
Electron tomography has become a cornerstone technique for the visualization of nanoparticle morphology in three dimensions. However, to obtain in&#8208;depth information about a nanoparticle beyond surface faceting and morphology, different electron microscopy signals must be combined. The most notable examples of these combined signals include annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy (ADF&#8208;STEM) with different collection angles and the combination of ADF&#8208;STEM with energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray or electron energy loss spectroscopies. Here, the experimental and computational development of various multimode tomography techniques in connection to the fundamental materials science challenges that multimode tomography has been instrumental to overcoming are summarized. Although the techniques can be applied to a wide variety of compositions, the study is restricted to metal and metal oxide nanoparticles for the sake of simplicity. Current challenges and future directions of multimode tomography are additionally discussed.

         <title>Endocytosis&#8208;Independent and Cancer&#8208;Selective Cytosolic Protein Delivery via Reversible Tagging with LAT1 substrate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pro&#8208;protein approach is developed based on reversible tagging with l&#8208;type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) substrate, which enables carrier&#8208;free, cancer&#8208;selective, and endocytosis&#8208;independent cytosolic delivery via LAT1&#8208;mediated direct transport. It demonstrates high generality and robust efficiency for varieties of functional proteins, including enzymes, toxins, antibodies, and CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 ribonucleoprotein. This facile and versatile platform holds transformative potentials in protein pharmaceuticals.








Abstract
Protein drugs targeting intracellular machineries have shown profound therapeutic potentials, but their clinical utilities are greatly hampered by the lack of efficient cytosolic delivery techniques. Existing strategies mainly rely on nanocarriers or conjugated cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs), which often have drawbacks such as materials complexity/toxicity, lack of cell specificity, and endolysosomal entrapment. Herein, a unique carrier&#8208;free approach is reported for mediating cancer&#8208;selective and endocytosis&#8208;free cytosolic protein delivery. Proteins are sequentially modified with 4&#8208;nitrophenyl 4&#8208;(4,4,5,5&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1,3,2&#8208;dioxaborolan&#8208;2&#8208;yl) benzyl carbonate as the H2O2&#8208;responsive domain and 3,4&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;l&#8208;phenylalanine as the substrate of l&#8208;type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1). Thus, the pro&#8208;protein can be directly transported into tumor cells by overexpressed LAT1 on cell membranes, bypassing endocytosis and endolysosomal entrapment. In the cytosol, overproduced H2O2 restores the protein structure and activity. Using this technique, versatile proteins are delivered into tumor cells with robust efficiency, including toxins, enzymes, CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 ribonucleoprotein, and antibodies. Furthermore, intravenously injected pro&#8208;protein of saporin shows potent anticancer efficacy in 4T1&#8208;tumor&#8208;bearing mice, without provoking systemic toxicity. Such a facile and versatile pro&#8208;protein platform may benefit the development of protein pharmaceuticals.

         <title>Reactive Oxygen Species Scavenging Nanomedicine for the Treatment of Ischemic Heart Disease</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The current developments, achievements, challenges, and future directions of reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;scavenging nanomedicine for the treatment of ischemic heart disease (IHD), as well as their risk factors, are reviewed. The properties, generation, and physiological roles of ROS in the process of IHD development and progression are discussed.








Abstract
Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is the leading cause of disability and mortality worldwide. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been shown to play key roles in the progression of diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia, which are independent risk factors that lead to atherosclerosis and the development of IHD. Engineered biomaterial&#8208;based nanomedicines are under extensive investigation and exploration, serving as smart and multifunctional nanocarriers for synergistic therapeutic effect. Capitalizing on cell/molecule&#8208;targeting drug delivery, nanomedicines present enhanced specificity and safety with favorable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Herein, the roles of ROS in both IHD and its risk factors are discussed, highlighting cardiovascular medications that have antioxidant properties, and summarizing the advantages, properties, and recent achievements of nanomedicines that have ROS scavenging capacity for the treatment of diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, atherosclerosis, ischemia/reperfusion, and myocardial infarction. Finally, the current challenges of nanomedicines for ROS&#8208;scavenging treatment of IHD and possible future directions are discussed from a clinical perspective.

         <title>A Tetrahedral Framework DNA&#8208;Based Bioswitchable miRNA Inhibitor Delivery System: Application to Skin Anti&#8208;Aging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioswitchable miR inhibitor delivery system (BiRDS) is designed in this study. BiRDS maximizes miR inhibitors&#8217; loading capacity while retaining the characteristics of small&#8208;sized tFNA. Superior skin penetration ability and RNA delivery are observed with significant antiaging effects. The excellent editability of the BiRDS confers it the potential to significantly improve the stability and delivery efficiency of miR inhibitors.








Abstract
MicroRNA (miR)&#8208;based therapy shows strong potential; however, structural limitations pose a challenge in fully exploiting its biomedical functionality. Tetrahedral framework DNA (tFNA) has proven to be an ideal vehicle for miR therapy. Inspired by the ancient Chinese myth &#8220;Sun and Immortal Birds,&#8221; a novel bioswitchable miR inhibitor delivery system (BiRDS) is designed with three miR inhibitors (the three immortal birds) and a nucleic acid core (the central sun). The BiRDS fuses miR inhibitors within the framework, maximizing their loading capacity, while allowing the system to retain the characteristics of small&#8208;sized tFNA and avoiding uncertainty associated with RNA exposure in traditional loading protocols. The RNase H&#8208;responsive sequence at the tail of each &#8220;immortal bird&#8221; enables the BiRDS to transform from a 3D to a 2D structure upon entering cells, promoting the delivery of miR inhibitors. To confirm the application potential, the BiRDS is used to deliver the miR&#8208;31 inhibitor, with antiaging effects on hair follicle stem cells, into a skin aging model. Superior skin penetration ability and RNA delivery are observed with significant anti&#8208;aging effects. These findings demonstrate the capability and editability of the BiRDS to improve the stability and delivery efficacy of miRs for future innovations.

         <title>Tuning Zn&#8208;ion Solvation Chemistry with Chelating Ligands towards Stable Aqueous Zn Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Changing the solvation sheath of hydrated Zn ions is an effective strategy to stabilize Zn anodes to obtain a practical aqueous Zn&#8208;ion battery. However, key points related to the rational design remain unclear including how the properties of the solvent molecules intrinsically regulate the solvated structure of the Zn ions. We propose using a stability constant (K), namely the equilibrium constant of the complexation reaction, as a universal standard to make an accurate selection of ligands in the electrolyte to improve the anode stability. It is found that K greatly impacts the corrosion current density and nucleation overpotential. Following this, ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid with a superhigh K effectively suppresses Zn corrosion and induces uniform Zn&#8208;ion deposition. As a result, the anode has an excellent stability of over 3000&#160;h. This work presents a general principle to stabilize anodes by regulating the solvation chemistry, guiding the development of novel electrolytes for sustainable aqueous batteries.

         <title>Tailoring the Desorption Behavior of Hygroscopic Gels for Atmospheric Water Harvesting in Arid Climates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The ubiquitous nature of atmospheric moisture makes it a significant water resource available at any geographical location. Atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) technology, which extracts moisture from ambient air to generate clean water, is a promising strategy to realize decentralized water production. The high water uptake exhibited by salt&#8208;based sorbents makes them attractive for AWH, especially in low relative humidity (RH) environments. Salt&#8208;based sorbents often have relatively high desorption heat, rendering water release an energy&#8208;intensive process. We proposed a hygroscopic gel, PAM hydrogel controlled incorporated with LiCl, capable of effective moisture harvesting from arid environments. The interactions between the hydrophilic hydrogel network and the captured water enable the PAM&#8208;LiCl to accumulate more free and weakly&#8208;bonded water molecules, significantly lowering the desorption heat compared with conventional neat salt sorbents. Benefiting from the affinity for swelling of the polymer backbones, the developed PAM&#8208;LiCl achieves a high water uptake of ca. 1.1&#160;g/g at 20% RH with fast sorption kinetics of ca. 0.008&#160;g g&#8211;1 min&#8211;1 and further demonstrates a daily water yield up to ca. 7&#160;g/g at this condition. These findings provide a new pathway for synthesis of materials with efficient water absorption/desorption properties, to reach energy&#8208;efficient water release for AWH in arid climates.

Abstract
The construction of robust (quasi) solid&#8208;state electrolytes for flexible lithium metal batteries is desirable but extremely challenging. Herein, we report a novel flexible and robust quasi solid&#8208;state electrolyte (QSSE) with a &#8220;Tree trunk&#8221; design for ultralong&#8208;life lithium metal batteries (LMBs). In&#8208;situ grown MOF layer covers cellulose&#8208;based framework to form hierarchical ion&#8208;channels, enabling a rapid ionic transfer kinetics and excellent durability. A conductivity of 1.36 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8211;1, a transference number of 0.72, an electrochemical window of 5.26&#160;V, and a good rate performance have been achieved. The flexible LMBs fabricated with as&#8208;designed QSSEs deliver an areal capacity up to 3.1 mAh cm&#8211;2 at initial cycle with a high mass loading of 14.8&#160;mg cm&#8211;2 in Li&#8208;NCM811 cells, and can keep &#8764;80% capacity retention after 300 cycles. An ultralong&#8208;life of 3000 cycles (6000 hours) is also achieved in Li&#8208;LiFePO4 cells. This work presents a promising route in constructing a flexible QSSE towards ultralong&#8208;life LMBs, and also provides a design rationale for material and structure development in the area of energy storage and conversion.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Scale Homogeneous Ru&#8211;Cu Alloy Nanoparticles for Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic Nitrogen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Ruthenium (Ru) is the most widely used metal as an electrocatalyst for nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) because of the relatively high N2 adsorption strength for successive reaction. Recently, it has been well reported that the homogeneous Ru&#8208;based metal alloys such as Ru&#8211;Rh, Ru&#8211;Pt, and Ru&#8211;Co significantly enhance the selectivity and formation rate of ammonia (NH3). However, the metal combinations for NRR have been limited to several miscible combinations of metals with Ru, although various immiscible combinations have immense potential to show high NRR performance. In this study, we first utilize an immiscible combination of Ru and copper (Cu), and fabricate homogeneous alloy nanoparticles (Ru&#8211;Cu NPs) by the carbothermal shock (CTS) method. The Ru&#8211;Cu homogeneous NP alloys on cellulose/CNT sponge exhibit the highest selectivity and NH3 formation rate of &#8764;31% and &#8722;73&#160;&#956;mol/h/cm2, respectively. These are the highest values of the selectivity and NH3 formation rates among existing Ru&#8208;based alloy metal combinations.

         <title>Engineering Ni&#8208;N&#8208;C Catalyst Microenvironment Enabling CO2 Electroreduction with Nearly 100% CO Selectivity in Acid</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
CO2 electrolysis in acid has been emerged as a promising route to achieve high CO2 utilization due to the inhibition of undesired carbonate formation that generally occurs in alkaline or neutral conditions. However, the efficiency and stability of this system need to be further improved through tailoring the electrocatalyst and its working environment. Here, we demonstrate that working microenvironment of structurally engineered Ni&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst for acidic CO2 electrolysis is probed and optimized by adding hydrophobic polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) nanoparticles in the catalytic layer of gas diffusion electrodes. The PTFE&#8208;modified electrode delivers nearly 100% CO Faradaic efficiency at an industry&#8208;relevant current density of 250&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, and a high single&#8208;pass CO2 utilization of 75.7% at a current density of 200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 under 20&#8208;sccm CO2 gas flow rate. Moreover, compared to a conventional electrode without added PTFE, the PTFE&#8208;modified electrode exhibits a substantially enhanced water&#8208;flooding&#8208;resistant ability. Mechanistic investigations reveal that a moderate PTFE modification can optimize the local CO2/H2O ratio in the catalytic layer, favoring the reduction of the diffusion layer thickness and the formation of highly active and stable solid&#8722;liquid&#8722;gas interfacial microenvironment.

         <title>Dramatic Enhancement of Thermoelectric Performance in PbTe by Unconventional Grain Shrinking in Sintering Process</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Nanostructure engineering is a key strategy for tailoring properties in the fields of batteries, solar cells, thermoelectrics, and so on.

&lt;p&gt;Nanostructure engineering is a key strategy for tailoring properties in the fields of batteries, solar cells, thermoelectrics, and so on. Limited by grain coarsening, however, the nanostructure effect gradually degrades during the materials&#8217; manufacturing and in-service period. Herein, we develop a strategy of cleavage-fracture for grain shrinking in the Pb&lt;sub&gt;0.98&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;0.02&lt;/sub&gt;Te sample during the sintering, and the grain size remains stable after repeated tests. Moreover, the initial grain boundary is filled by fractured slender grains and enriched by dislocations, evolving into a hierarchical grain-boundary structure.

         <title>An Ultrahigh Rate and Stable Zinc Anode by Facet&#8208;matching&#8208;induced Dendrite Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Resource&#8208;abundant metal (e.g., zinc) batteries feature intrinsic advantages of safety and sustainability. Their practical feasibility, however, is impeded by the poor reversibility of metal anode, typically caused by the uncontrollable dendrite enlargement. Significant effort has been exerted to completely prevent dendrites from forming, but this seems less effective at high current densities. Herein, we present an alternative dendrite regulation strategy of forming tiny, homogeneously distributed, and identical zinc dendrites by facet matching, which effectively avoids undesirable dendrite enlargement. Confirmed by multiscale theoretical screening and characterization, the regularly exposed Cu(111) facets at the ridges of a copper nanowire are capable of such dendrite regulation by forming a low&#8208;mismatched Zn(002)/Cu(111) interface. Consequently, reversible zinc electroplating/stripping has been achieved at an unprecedentedly high rate of 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for over 30,000 cycles, corresponding to an accumulative areal capacity up to 30 Ah cm&#8722;2. A full cell using this anode shows a high capacity of 308.3 mAh g&#8722;1 and a high capacity retention of 91.4% after 800 cycles. This strategy is also viable for magnesium and aluminum anodes, thus opening up a promising and universal avenue towards long life and high rate metal anodes.

         <title>Stabilisation and Performance Enhancement Strategies for Halide Perovskite Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Solar energy&#8208;powered photocatalytic fuel production and chemical synthesis have been widely recognised as viable technological solutions for a sustainable energy future. However, the requirement of high&#8208;performance photocatalysts is a major bottleneck. Halide perovskites, a category of diversified semiconductor materials with suitable energy band&#8208;enabled high light utilisation efficiencies, exceptionally&#8208;long charge&#8208;carrier diffusion length&#8208;faciliated charge transport, and readily tailorable compositional, structural and morphological properties, have emerged as a new class of photocatalysts for efficient hydrogen evolution, CO2 reduction and various organic synthesis reactions. Despite the noticeable progress, the development of high&#8208;performance halide perovskite photocatalysts (HPPs) is still hindered by several key challenges: the strong ionic nature and high hydrolysis tendency induced instability and an unsatifactory activity due to the need for a co&#8208;active component to realise redox processes. Herein, the recently developed advanced strategies to enhance the stability and photocatalytic activity of the HPPs are comprehensively reviewed. We firstly articulate the widely applicable stability enhancement strategies, and then explore the activity improvement strategies for fuel production and chemical synthesis. Finally, the challenges and future perspectives associated with the application of HPPs in efficient production of fuels and value&#8208;added chemicals are presented, indicating the irreplaceable role of the HPPs in the field of photocatalysis.

Abstract
Currently, extensive research efforts are being devoted to suppressing the shuttle effect of polysulfides. The uncontrollable deposition of insulating Li2S onto the surface of sulfur host materials dramatically inhibits the continuous reduction of polysulfides in lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries. Herein, N, B co&#8208;doped hollow carbon microspheres embedded with dense FeSe&#8208;MnSe heterostructures and abundant Se vacancies (FeSe&#8208;MnSe/NBC) were rationally designed and synthesized via a facile hydrothermal reaction using ionic liquids (ILs) as dopants. The introduction of abundant heterostructures subtly guides Li2S nucleation and deposition in three&#8208;dimensional (3D) frameworks, thus avoiding the formation of the Li2S passivation layer and allowing for continuous Li+ diffusion and subsequent nucleation of Li2S. Owing to these beneficial features, Li&#8211;S batteries comprising an FeSe&#8208;MnSe/NBC electrode exhibited significantly improved performance, including a high initial capacity of 1334 mAh g&#8211;1 at 0.2 C and ultra&#8208;long cycle stability with a low&#8208;capacity fading rate of 0.029% per cycle over 1000 cycles at 1.0 C. Remarkably, the FeSe&#8208;MnSe/NBC pouch cell delivered a considerable areal capacity of 3.6 mAh cm&#8211;2 at 0.1 C. This study provides valuable insight into heterostructures and Se vacancies for developing practical Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Self&#8208;formation CoO Nanodots Catalyst in Co(TFSI)2&#8208;Modified Electrolyte for High Efficient Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The major challenges for Li&#8208;O2 batteries are sluggish reaction kinetics and large overpotentials due to the cathode passivation resulted from insulative and insoluble Li2O2. Here, a novel nanodots (NDs)&#8208;modified electrolyte is designed by employing cobalt bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (Co(TFSI)2) as an electrolyte additive. The Co(TFSI)2 additive can react with discharge intermediate LiO2 and product Li2O2 to form CoO NDs. The generated CoO NDs are well dispersed in electrolyte, which integrates both high catalytic activity of solid catalyst and well wettability of soluble catalyst. Under the catalytic of CoO NDs, Li2O2 produces and deposits on cathode together with them. At recharge process, these well dispersed CoO NDs help to decompose solid Li2O2 at a lower overpotential. The Li&#8208;O2 cells with Co(TFSI)2 exhibit a long cycle life of 200 cycles at a current density of 200&#160;mA g&#8722;1 under a cutoff capacity of 1000 mAh g&#8722;1, as well as a superior reversibility associated with the Li2O2 formation and decomposition. We expect that the study could broaden the range of electrolyte additives and provide a new view to develop highly dispersed NDs&#8208;based catalyst for Li&#8208;O2 batteries.

         <title>Synergizing Hydrogen Spillover and Deprotonation by Internal Polarization Field in MoS2/NiPS3 Vertical Heterostructure for Boosted Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hydrogen spillover has emerged to upgrade hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of Pt&#8208;support electrocatalysts, but it is not applicable to the deprotonated oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Non&#8208;precious catalysts that can perform well in both hydrogen spillover and deprotonation are extremely desirable for sustainable hydrogen economy. Herein, an affordable MoS2/NiPS3 vertical heterostructure catalyst is presented to synergize hydrogen spillover and deprotonation for efficient water electrolysis.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydrogen spillover has emerged to upgrade hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of Pt-support electrocatalysts, but it is not applicable to the deprotonated oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Non-precious catalysts that can perform well in both hydrogen spillover and deprotonation are extremely desirable for sustainable hydrogen economy. Herein, an affordable MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/NiPS&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; vertical heterostructure catalyst is presented to synergize hydrogen spillover and deprotonation for efficient water electrolysis. Internal polarization field (IPF) is clarified as the driving force nature of hydrogen spillover in HER electrocatalysis. The hydrogen spillover from MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; edge to NiPS&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; can activate the NiPS&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; basal plane to boost the HER activity of MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/NiPS&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; heterostructure (112&#160;mV versus RHE at 10&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;2&lt;/sup&gt;). While for OER, the IPF in the heterostructure can facilitate the hydroxyl diffusion and render the NiPS&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-to-MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/P-to-S dual-pathways for deprotonation. Resultantly, the stacking of OER-inactive MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on the NiPS&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; surface still brings intriguing OER enhancements. Serving them as electrode couples, the overall water splitting is attested stably with a cell voltage of 1.64&#160;V at 10&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

         <title>Ultrafine Silver Nanoparticle Encapsulated Porous Molecular Traps for Discriminative Photoelectrochemical Detection of Mustard Gas Simulants by Synergistic Size&#8208;Exclusion and Site&#8208;Specific Recognition</title>

         <dc:description>
An in situ photoreduction and subsequent encapsulation process affords nanocomposite materials comprising sub&#8208;1&#160;nm Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) encapsulated in hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs). Compared to traditional semiconductors and selected metal&#8211;organic framework materials, the AgNPs@HOFs exhibit significantly enhanced photocurrent. A portable photoelectrochemical (PEC) device based on AgNPs@HOF&#8208;101 detects chemical warfare agent (CWA) simulants with both nanomolar sensitivity and excellent selectivity.








Abstract
The rapid, discriminative, and portable detection of highly toxic chemical warfare agents is extremely important for response to public security emergencies but remains a challenge. One plausible solution involves the integration of porous molecular traps onto a photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensor. Here, a fast and facile protocol is developed to fabricate sub&#8208;1&#160;nm AgNPs encapsulated hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) nanocomposite materials through an in situ photoreduction and subsequent encapsulation process. Compared to traditional semiconductors and selected metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOF) materials, these AgNPs@HOFs show significantly enhanced photocurrent. Most importantly, the portable PEC device based on AgNPs@HOF&#8208;101 can selectively recognize 13 different mustard gas simulants, including 2&#8208;chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES), based on synergistic size&#8208;exclusion and specific recognition. The extremely low detection limit for CEES (15.8&#160;nmol L&#8722;1), reusability (at least 30 cycles), and long&#8208;term working stability (at least 30 d) of the portable PEC device warrant its use as a chemical warfare agents (CWAs) sensor in practical field settings. More broadly, this work indicates that integrating porous molecular traps onto PEC sensors offers a promising strategy to further develop portable devices for CWAs detection with both ultrahigh sensitivity and selectivity.

         <title>Convection Driven Ultrarapid Protein Detection via Nanobody&#8208;Functionalized Organic Electrochemical Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing alternating current electrothermal flow (ACET) at the sample incubation step accelerates the operation of an organic&#8208;electrochemical&#8208;transistor&#8208;based protein sensor with a limit of detection at the attomolar range. The ACET integrated sensor exhibits a sample&#8208;to&#8208;result time of 2 min, with better selectivity, higher sensitivity, and lower limit of detection than the equivalent sensor with diffusion&#8208;dominated operation.








Abstract
Conventional biosensors rely on the diffusion&#8208;dominated transport of the target analyte to the sensor surface. Consequently, they require an incubation step that may take several hours to allow for the capture of analyte molecules by sensor biorecognition sites. This incubation step is a primary cause of long sample&#8208;to&#8208;result times. Here, alternating current electrothermal flow (ACET) is integrated in an organic electrochemical transistor (OECT)&#8208;based sensor to accelerate the device operation. ACET is applied to the gate electrode functionalized with nanobody&#8211;SpyCatcher fusion proteins. Using the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein in human saliva as an example target, it is shown that ACET enables protein recognition within only 2 min of sample exposure, supporting its use in clinical practice. The ACET integrated sensor exhibits better selectivity, higher sensitivity, and lower limit of detection than the equivalent sensor with diffusion&#8208;dominated operation. The performance of ACET integrated sensors is compared with two types of organic semiconductors in the channel and grounds for device&#8208;to&#8208;device variations are investigated. The results provide guidelines for the channel material choice in OECT&#8208;based biochemical sensors, and demonstrate that ACET integration substantially decreases the detection speed while increasing the sensitivity and selectivity of transistor&#8208;based sensors.

         <title>Stacking and Twisting of Freestanding Complex Oxide Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The integration of dissimilar materials in heterostructures has long been a cornerstone of modern materials science &#8211; seminal examples are the two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials and van der Waals heterostructures. Recently, new methods have been developed, which enable the realization of ultra&#8208;thin freestanding oxide films approaching the 2D limit. Oxides offer new degrees of freedom, due to the strong electronic interactions, especially the 3d orbitals, which give rise to rich exotic phases. Inspired by this progress, we have developed a new platform for assembling ultra&#8208;thin freestanding oxide thin films with different materials and orientations into artificial stacks with heterointerfaces. We show that the oxide stacks can be tailored by controlling the stacking sequences as well as the twist angle between the constituent layers with atomically sharp interfaces, leading to distinct moir&#233; patterns in the transmission electron micrographs of the full stacks. Stacking and twisting has been recognized as a key degree of structural freedom in 2D materials but until now has never been realized for oxide materials. Our approach opens unexplored avenues for fabricating artificial 3D oxide stacking structure with freestanding membranes across a broad range of complex oxide crystal structures with functionalities not available in conventional 2D materials.

         <title>Fingerprints Indicating Superior Properties of Internal Interfaces in Cu(In,Ga)Se2 Thin&#8208;Film Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Growth of Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) absorbers under Cu&#8208;poor conditions gives rise to incorporation of numerous defects into the bulk, whereas the same absorber grown under Cu&#8208;rich conditions leads to a stoichiometric bulk with minimum defects. This suggests that CIGS absorbers grown under Cu&#8208;rich conditions are more suitable for solar cell applications. However, the CIGS solar cell devices with record efficiencies have all been fabricated under Cu&#8208;poor conditions, despite the expectations. Therefore, in the present work, we investigate both Cu&#8208;poor and Cu&#8208;rich CIGS cells and show that the superior properties of internal interfaces of Cu&#8208;poor CIGS cells, such as p&#8208;n junction and grain boundaries, makes them always the record&#8208;efficiency devices. More precisely, by employing a correlative microscopy approach, we discover for the first time the typical fingerprints for superior properties of internal interfaces necessary for maintaining a lower recombination activity in the cell. These are a Cu&#8208;depleted and Cd&#8208;enriched CIGS absorber surface near the p&#8208;n junction and the negative Cu factor (&#8710;&#946;) and high Na content (&gt; 1.5 at.%) at the grain boundaries. Thus, this work provides key factors governing the device performance (efficiency), which can be considered in the design of next&#8208;generation solar cells.

         <title>Surface Lattice Plasmon Resonances by Direct in situ Substrate Growth of Gold Nanoparticles in Ordered Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Precise arrangements of plasmonic nanoparticles on substrates are important for designing optoelectronics, sensors, and metamaterials with rational electronic, optical, and magnetic properties. Bottom&#8208;up synthesis offers unmatched control over morphology and optical response of individual plasmonic building blocks. Usually, the incorporation of nanoparticles made by bottom&#8208;up wet chemistry starts from batch synthesis of colloids, which requires time&#8208;consuming and hard&#8208;to&#8208;scale steps like ligand exchange and self&#8208;assembly. Herein, we develop an unconventional bottom&#8208;up wet&#8208;chemical synthetic approach for producing gold nanoparticle ordered arrays. Water&#8208;processable hydroxypropyl cellulose stencils facilitate the patterning of a reductant chemical ink on which nanoparticle growth selectively occurs. Arrays exhibiting lattice plasmon resonances in the visible region and near infrared (quality factors &gt;20) were produced following a rapid synthetic step (&lt;10&#160;min), all without cleanroom fabrication, specialized equipment, or self&#8208;assembly, constituting a major step forward establishing in situ growth approaches. We further demonstrate the technical capabilities of this method through modulation of the particle size, shape, and array spacings directly on the substrate. Ultimately, establishing a fundamental understanding of in situ growth has the potential to inform the fabrication of plasmonic materials, opening the door for in situ growth fabrication of waveguides, lasing platforms, and plasmonic sensors.

         <title>Tuning the Magnetization of Manganese (II) Carbonate by Intracrystalline Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bioinspired strategy of intracrystalline amino acids incorporation can be utilized to tune the magnetic properties of a crystalline host whereby both the magnetic susceptibility and N&#233;el temperature of MnCO3 change due to the incorporation of aspartic acid. These changes are attributed to the weakening of the Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction, which results from the incorporation&#8208;induced lattice expansion.








Abstract
Incorporation of organic molecules into the lattice of inorganic crystalline hosts is a common phenomenon in biomineralization and is shown to alter various properties of the crystalline host. Taking this phenomenon as a source of inspiration, it is shown herein that incorporation of specific single amino acids into the lattice of manganese (II) carbonate strongly alters its inherent magnetic properties. At room temperature, the magnetic susceptibility of the amino&#8208;acid&#8208;incorporating paramagnetic MnCO3 decreases, following a simple rule of mixtures. When cooled below the N&#233;el temperature, however, the opposite trend is observed, namely an increase in magnetic susceptibility measured in a high magnetic field. Such an increase, accompanied by a drastic change in the N&#233;el phase transformation temperature, results from a decrease in MnCO3 orbital overlapping and the weakening of superexchange interactions. It may be that this is the first time that the magnetic properties of a host crystal are tuned via the incorporation of amino acids.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Liquid Crystalline Polymer for Intrinsic Fire&#8208;Resistant and Flexible Triboelectric Nanogenerators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly rigid main chain of liquid crystalline poly(aryl ether ester) (LCPAEE) endows triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) with outstanding anti&#8208;dripping, temperature&#8208; and fire&#8208;resistance, and the electrical output performance remains over 65% even after combustion for 16 s above 520&#160;&#176;C, which goes beyond any previous work on flame&#8208;retardant TENGs.








Abstract
Flammability is a great challenge in the fields of electronics. The emergence of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) provides a safe way to harvest environmentalally friendly energy and convert it into more secure power sources. Especially, polymer&#8208;based TENGs significantly accelerate the practical application of self&#8208;powered flexible electronics. However, most of the existing polymeric materials for TENGs are easily flammable and melt, dripping, in a fire scenario, and cannot be reused after combustion, which greatly limits the application of TENGs under extreme conditions. Herein, a fire&#8208;resistant TENG based on all&#8208;aromatic liquid crystalline poly(aryl ether ester) (LCPAEE) synthesized via simple and efficient one&#8208;pot melt polycondensation is reported. The highly rigid main chain of LCPAEE endows the LCP&#8208;TENG with outstanding anti&#8208;dripping, temperature&#8208; and fire&#8208;resistance. The resultant LCP&#8208;TENG exhibits excellent electrical output performance, which is attributed to the high dielectric constant (&#949;&#8242;&#160;= 4.8) and fibrous&#8208;structured morphology of LCPAEE. The device can maintain over 65% of open&#8208;circuit voltage even after 16 s combustion (&#8776;520&#160;&#176;C). Consequently, this work offers a novel strategy for tailoring the TENGs toward a secure power generator and electronics with fire hazard reduction, and potential application in firefighting, personal protection, and other extreme temperature environments.

High&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8211;sulfur pouch cells are cpomprehensively reviewed regarding the key design parameters, the current performances, and recent advances on failure analysis and promotion strategies on cathode, electrolyte, and anode.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries promise great potential as high&#8208;energy&#8208;density energy&#8208;storage devices due to their ultrahigh theoretical energy density of 2600&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1. Evaluation and analysis on practical Li&#8211;S pouch cells are essential for achieving actual high energy density under working conditions and affording developing directions for practical applications. This review aims to afford a comprehensive overview of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li&#8211;S pouch cells regarding 7&#160;years of development and to point out further research directions. Key design parameters to achieve actual high energy density are addressed first, to define the research boundaries distinguished from coin&#8208;cell&#8208;level evaluation. Systematic analysis of the published literature and cutting&#8208;edge performances is then conducted to demonstrate the achieved progress and the gap toward practical applications. Following that, failure analysis as well as promotion strategies at the pouch cell level are, respectively, discussed to reveal the unique working and failure mechanism that shall be accordingly addressed. Finally, perspectives toward high&#8208;performance Li&#8211;S pouch cells are presented regarding the challenges and opportunities of this field.

Abstract
Ever since the invention of solid&#8208;state transistors, binary devices have dominated the electronics industry. Although the binary technology links the natural property of devices to be in the ON or OFF state with two logic levels, it provides the least possible information content per interconnect. Multi&#8208;valued logic (MVL) has long been considered as a means of improving the computation efficiency and reducing the power consumption of modern chips. In view of the power density limits of the conventional complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor technology, MVL technologies have recently gained even more attention, and various MVL unit devices based on conventional and emerging materials have been proposed. Herein, we overview the achievements toward the development of compact MVL unit devices. First, we introduce basic principles of MVL technologies by describing methods of obtaining multiple logic states and discussing radix&#8208;related aspects of MVL computation. Next, we classify and overview MVL unit devices with emphasis on principles of operation, technologies, and applications. Finally, we provide a comparative discussion of strengths and weaknesses for each class of MVL devices and conclude with the outlook for the MVL field.

         <title>Reprogramming Mitochondrial Metabolism in Synovial Macrophages of Early Osteoarthritis by a Camouflaged Meta&#8208;Defensome</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 30, July 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The relationship between mitochondrial dysfunction and osteoarthritis (OA) severity is established and an effective strategy for reprogramming the mitochondrial metabolism is pioneered, through a novel camouflaged dual&#8208;targeting meta&#8208;Defensome, comprising macrophage&#8208;membrane&#8208;cloaked polymeric nanoparticles loaded with double nanoenzymes that scavenge mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and inhibit mitochondrial nitric oxide synthase, efficiently restoring the M1/M2 macrophage imbalance in the synovium and impeding OA progression.








Abstract
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a low&#8208;grade inflammatory and progressive joint disease, and its progression is closely associated with an imbalance in M1/M2 synovial macrophages. Repolarizing pro&#8208;inflammatory M1 macrophages into the anti&#8208;inflammatory M2 phenotype is emerging as a strategy to alleviate OA progression but is compromised by unsatisfactory efficiency. In this study, the reprogramming of mitochondrial dysfunction is pioneered with a camouflaged meta&#8208;Defensome, which can transform M1 synovial macrophages into the M2 phenotype with a high efficiency of 82.3%. The meta&#8208;Defensome recognizes activated macrophages via receptor&#8211;ligand interactions and accumulates in the mitochondria through electrostatic attractions. These meta&#8208;Defensomes are macrophage&#8208;membrane&#8208;coated polymeric nanoparticles decorated with dual ligands and co&#8208;loaded with S&#8208;methylisothiourea and MnO2. Meta&#8208;Defensomes are demonstrated to successfully reprogram the mitochondrial metabolism of M1 macrophages by scavenging mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and inhibiting mitochondrial NO synthase, thereby increasing mitochondrial transcription factor A expression and restoring aerobic respiration. Furthermore, meta&#8208;Defensomes are intravenously injected into collagenase&#8208;induced osteoarthritis mice and effectively suppress synovial inflammation and progression of early OA, as evident from the Osteoarthritis Research Society International score. Therefore, reprogramming the mitochondrial metabolism can serve as a novel and practical approach to repolarize M1 synovial macrophages. The camouflaged meta&#8208;Defensomes are a promising therapeutic agent for impeding OA progression in tclinic.

&lt;p&gt;Osteoarthritis (OA) is a low-grade inflammatory and progressive joint disease, and its progression is closely associated with an imbalance in M1/M2 synovial macrophages. Repolarizing pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages into the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype is emerging as a strategy to alleviate OA progression but is compromised by unsatisfactory efficiency. In this study, the reprogramming of mitochondrial dysfunction is pioneered with a camouflaged meta-Defensome, which can transform M1 synovial macrophages into the M2 phenotype with a high efficiency of 82.3%. The meta-Defensome recognizes activated macrophages via receptor&#8211;ligand interactions and accumulates in the mitochondria through electrostatic attractions. These meta-Defensomes are macrophage-membrane-coated polymeric nanoparticles decorated with dual ligands and co-loaded with S-methylisothiourea and MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

         <title>Multiphoton Lithography of Organic Semiconductor Devices for 3D Printing of Flexible Electronic Circuits, Biosensors, and Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 30, July 27, 2022. </description>

3D printing of flexible microelectronics has gained significant attention. In this work, a photosensitive resin doped with organic semiconductor material is developed for direct laser writing based on multiphoton lithography. Fabrication of microelectronic devices, hybrid microelectrodes, cell&#8208;adhesive substrates, and high&#8208;performance glucose biosensors are successfully demonstrated. These soft and conductive microstructures have potential in flexible electronics, organic bioelectronics, and biosensors.








Abstract
In recent years, 3D printing of electronics have received growing attention due to their potential applications in emerging fields such as nanoelectronics and nanophotonics. Multiphoton lithography (MPL) is considered the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art amongst the microfabrication techniques with true 3D fabrication capability owing to its excellent level of spatial and temporal control. Here, a homogenous and transparent photosensitive resin doped with an organic semiconductor material (OS), which is compatible with MPL process, is introduced to fabricate a variety of 3D OS composite microstructures (OSCMs) and microelectronic devices. Inclusion of 0.5 wt% OS in the resin enhances the electrical conductivity of the composite polymer about 10 orders of magnitude and compared to other MPL&#8208;based methods, the resultant OSCMs offer high specific electrical conductivity. As a model protein, laminin is incorporated into these OSCMs without a significant loss of activity. The OSCMs are biocompatible and support cell adhesion and growth. Glucose&#8208;oxidase&#8208;encapsulated OSCMs offer a highly sensitive glucose sensing platform with nearly tenfold higher sensitivity compared to previous glucose biosensors. In addition, this biosensor exhibits excellent specificity and high reproducibility. Overall, these results demonstrate the great potential of these novel MPL&#8208;fabricated OSCM devices for a wide range of applications from flexible bioelectronics/biosensors, to nanoelectronics and organ&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip devices.

         <title>Blading of Conformal Electron&#8208;Transport Layers in p&#8211;i&#8211;n Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 30, July 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
All the reported perovskite modules have a combination of different deposition methods for the perovskites and the charge&#8208;transport layers, which limits high&#8208;throughput module production. A combination of any amine molecules and 4&#8208;(2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;N,N&#8208;dimethylbenzenamine (N&#8208;DMBI) added in phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) allows the electrically conductive PCBM layers to conformally cover the perovskites and achieve high&#8208;efficiency&#160;PSCs and modules with all&#8208;bladed perovskite and charge&#8208;transport layers.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are promising to reduce the cost of photovoltaic system due to their low&#8208;cost raw materials and high&#8208;throughput solution process; however, fabrication of&#160;all the active layers in perovskite modules using a scalable solution process has not yet been demonstrated. Herein, the fabrication of highly efficient PSCs and modules in ambient conditions is reported, with all layers bladed except the metal electrode, by blading a 36&#160;&#177;&#160;9&#160;nm&#8208;thick electron&#8208;transport layer (ETL) on perovskite films with a roughness of &#8776;80&#160;nm. A combination of additives in phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) allows the PCBM to conformally cover the perovskites and still have a good electrical conductivity. Amine&#8208;functionalized molecules are added to enhance both the dispersity of PCBM and the affinity to perovskites. A PCBM dopant of 4&#8208;(2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;N,N&#8208;dimethylbenzenamine (N&#8208;DMBI) recovers the conductivity loss induced by the small amine molecules. PSCs (0.08 cm2) fabricated by the all&#8208;blading process reache an average efficiency of 22.4&#160;&#177;&#160;0.5%&#160;and a champion efficiency of 23.1% for perovskites with a bandgap of 1.51&#160;eV, with much better stability compared to evaporated ETL PSCs. The all&#8208;bladed minimodule (25.03 cm2) shows an aperture efficiency of &#8776;19.3%, showing the good uniformity of the bladed ETLs.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Driven Auto&#8208;Detachable Patterning of Flexible Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 30, July 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;shrinkage&#8208;assisted patterning by evaporation&#8221; (SHAPE) method is reported to fabricate freestanding and flexible electrodes. The multimaterial, multilayer, and shape&#8208;designable properties of the SHAPE method for fabrication of flexible electrodes provide electronics with unconfined stacking, customizable stretchability, and conformable integration on arbitrary surfaces, demonstrating their wide spectrum of applications in wearable and 3D integrated electronics.








Abstract
Flexible electrodes that are multilayer, multimaterial, and conformal are pivotal for multifunctional wearable electronics. Traditional electronic circuits manufacturing requires substrate&#8208;supported transfer printing, which limits their multilayer integrity and device conformability on arbitrary surfaces. Herein, a &#8220;shrinkage&#8208;assisted patterning by evaporation&#8221; (SHAPE) method is reported, by employing evaporation&#8208;induced interfacial strain mismatch, to fabricate auto&#8208;detachable, freestanding, and patternable electrodes. The SHAPE method utilizes vacuum&#8208;filtration of polyaniline/bacterial cellulose (PANI/BC) ink through a masked filtration membrane to print high&#8208;resolution, patterned, and multilayer electrodes. The strong interlayer hydrogen bonding ensures robust multilayer integrity, while the controllable evaporative shrinking property of PANI/BC induces mismatch between the strains of the electrode and filtration membrane at the interface and thus autodetachment of electrodes. Notably, a 500&#8208;layer substrateless micro&#8208;supercapacitor fabricated using the SHAPE method exhibits an energy density of 350 mWh cm&#8722;2 at a power density of 40&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, 100 times higher than reported substrate&#8208;confined counterparts. Moreover, a digital circuit fabricated using the SHAPE method functions stably on a deformed glove, highlighting the broad wearable applications of the SHAPE method.

         <title>Machine Learning on a Robotic Platform for the Design of Polymer&#8211;Protein Hybrids</title>

Polymer&#8211;protein hybrids (PPHs) offer new opportunities for protein stabilization in industrial and medical applications. Utilizing a combination of automated polymer synthesis and active machine learning, a Learn&#8211;Design&#8211;Test&#8211;Build strategy for protein&#8208;tailored copolymer design and synthesis is reported. The structure&#8211;function relationships within PPHs are probed using generated experimental data, and biophysical characterization is performed to elucidate potential mechanisms of stability within PPHs.








Abstract
Polymer&#8211;protein hybrids are intriguing materials that can bolster protein stability in non&#8208;native environments, thereby enhancing their utility in diverse medicinal, commercial, and industrial applications. One stabilization strategy involves designing synthetic random copolymers with compositions attuned to the protein surface, but rational design is complicated by the vast chemical and composition space. Here, a strategy is reported to design protein&#8208;stabilizing copolymers based on active machine learning, facilitated by automated material synthesis and characterization platforms. The versatility and robustness of the approach is demonstrated by the successful identification of copolymers that preserve, or even enhance, the activity of three chemically distinct enzymes following exposure to thermal denaturing conditions. Although systematic screening results in mixed success, active learning appropriately identifies unique and effective copolymer chemistries for the stabilization of each enzyme. Overall, this work broadens the capabilities to design fit&#8208;for&#8208;purpose synthetic copolymers that promote or otherwise manipulate protein activity, with extensions toward the design of robust polymer&#8211;protein hybrid&#160;materials.

         <title>Diammonium&#8208;Mediated Perovskite Film Formation for High&#8208;Luminescence Red Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 30, July 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;luminance red perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) are enabled by diammonium&#8208;mediated perovskite formation. The diammonium halide promotes the formation of stable bromide&#8208;rich quasi&#8208;2D phases at the surface of 3D perovskites, leading to efficient defect passivation, suppression of ion migration, and reduced lattice strain. The optimized PeLEDs exhibit a record luminance (&gt;105 cd m&#8722;2) and half&#8208;lifetime (&gt;15 h) among red&#8208;emissive 3D PeLEDs.








Abstract
3D mixed&#8208;halide perovskite&#8208;based red emitters combine excellent charge&#8208;transport characteristics with simple solution processing and good film formation; however, light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) based on these emitters cannot yet outperform their nanocrystal counterparts. Here the use of diammonium halides in regulating the formation of mixed bromide&#8211;iodide perovskite films is explored. It is found that the diammonium cations preferentially bond to Pb&#8211;Br, rather than Pb&#8211;I, octahedra, promoting the formation of quasi&#8208;2D phases. It is proposed that the perovskite formation is initially dominated by the crystallization of the thermodynamically more favorable 3D phase, but, as the solution gets depleted from the regular A cations, thin shells of amorphous quasi&#8208;2D perovskites form. This leads to crystalline perovskite grains with efficiently passivated surfaces and reduced lattice strain. As a result, the diammonium&#8208;treated perovskite LEDs demonstrate a record luminance (10745&#160;cd m&#8722;2) and half&#8208;lifetime among 3D perovskite&#8208;based red LEDs.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Broadband Strong Electromagnetic Interference Shielding with Ferromagnetic Graphene Quartz Fabric</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 30, July 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel broadband, strong electromagnetic intereference (EMI) shielding response fabric based on highly structured ferromagnetic graphene quartz fibers is demonstrated, which combines high conductivity and ferromagnetism to attain a synergistic effect for EMI shielding and electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorption, along with the specific woven superstructure of the fabric to introduce the additional multiple reflections and multichannel absorption of EMWs.








Abstract
Flexible electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding materials with ultrahigh shielding effectiveness (SE) are highly desirable for high&#8208;speed electronic devices to attenuate radiated emissions. For hindering interference of their internal or external EMI fields, however, a metallic enclosure suffers from relatively low SE, band&#8208;limited anti&#8208;EMI responses, poor corrosion resistance, and non&#8208;adaptability to the complex geometry of a given circuit. Here, a broadband, strong EMI shielding response fabric is demonstrated based on a highly structured ferromagnetic graphene quartz fiber (FGQF) via a modulation&#8208;doped chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth process. The precise control of the graphitic N&#8208;doping configuration endows graphene coatings on specifically designable quartz fabric weave with both high conductivity (3906 S&#160;cm&#8722;1) and high magnetic responsiveness (a saturation magnetization of &#8776;0.14 emu&#160;g&#8722;1 under 300 K), thus attaining synergistic effect of EMI shielding and electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorption for broadband anti&#8208;EMI technology. The large&#8208;scale durable FGQF exhibits extraordinary EMI SE of &#8776;107&#160;dB over a broadband frequency (1&#8211;18&#160;GHz), by configuring &#8776;20&#160;nm&#8208;thick graphene coatings on a millimeter&#8208;thick quartz fabric. This work enables the potential for development of an industrial&#8208;scale, flexible, lightweight, durable, and ultra&#8208;broadband strong shielding material in advanced applications of flexible anti&#8208;electronic reconnaissance, antiradiation, and stealthy technologies.

         <title>Structural Dynamics and Tunability for Colloidal Tin Halide Perovskite Nanostructures</title>

The synthesis of stable, tunable, and monodisperse colloidal CsSnI3 nanocrystals or a mixture of 3D CsSnI3 nanocrystals and 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (R&#8208;NH3+)2Csn&#8722;1SnnI3n+1 perovskite nanosheets is reported. The key factor in this chemical design is the nucleation and growth of the CsSnI3 nanocrystals from (R&#8208;NH3+)2SnI4.








Abstract
Lead halide perovskite nanocrystals are highly attractive for next&#8208;generation optoelectronics because they are easy to synthesize and offer great compositional and morphological tunability. However, the replacement of lead by tin for sustainability reasons is hampered by the unstable nature of Sn2+ oxidation state and by an insufficient understanding of the chemical processes involved in the synthesis. Here, an optimized synthetic route is demonstrated to obtain stable, tunable, and monodisperse CsSnI3 nanocrystals, exhibiting well&#8208;defined excitonic peaks. Similar to lead halide perovskites, these nanocrystals are prepared by combining a precursor mixture of SnI2, oleylamine, and oleic acid, with a Cs&#8208;oleate precursor. Among the products, nanocrystals with 10&#160;nm lateral size in the &#947;&#8208;orthorhombic phase prove to be the most stable. To achieve such stability, an excess of precursor SnI2 as well as substoichiometric Sn:ligand ratios are key. Structural, compositional, and optical investigations complemented by first&#8208;principle density functional theory calculations confirm that nanocrystal nucleation and growth follow the formation of (R&#8208;NH3+)2SnI4 nanosheets, with R = C18H35. Under specific synthetic conditions, stable mixtures of 3D nanocrystals CsSnI3 and 2D nanosheets (Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (R&#8208;NH3+)2Csn&#8722;1SnnI3n+1 with n&#160;&gt; 1) are obtained. These results set a path to exploiting the high potential of Sn halide perovskite nanocrystals for opto&#8208;electronic applications.

         <title>Carrier&#8208;Transport Mechanism in Organic Antiambipolar Transistors Unveiled by Operando Photoemission Electron Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 30, July 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The carrier transport in an organic antiambipolar transistor (AAT) is examined using operando photoemission electron microscopy. The approach visualizes the conductive electrons under the actual transistor operations and reveals that a lateral p&#8211;n junction is crucial for the negative differential transconductance in the AAT. These results help in enhancing&#160;the device's performance.








Abstract
Organic antiambipolar transistors (AATs) have partially overlapped p&#8211;n junctions. At room temperature, this p&#8211;n junction induces a negative differential transconductance in an AAT. However, the detailed carrier&#8208;transport mechanism remains unclear. Herein, an operando photoemission electron microscopy is used to tackle this issue owing to the technique's ability to visualize conductive electrons in real time during transistor operation. Notably, it is observed that when the AAT is on, a depletion layer forms at the lateral p&#8211;n junction. The visualized depletion layer shows that both p&#8208; and n&#8208;type channels have pinch&#8208;off states in the gate voltage range when the AAT is in on state. The steep potential gradient at the lateral p&#8211;n interface enhances the electron conduction from n&#8208;type to p&#8208;type semiconductor. Another significant finding is that most electrons are considered to recombine with the accumulated holes in the p&#8208;type semiconductor, affording the reduction of photoemission intensity by &#8776;80%. This technique provides a thorough understanding of carrier transport in AATs, further improving the device performance.

         <title>Systematic Screening and Therapeutic Evaluation of Glyconanoparticles with Differential Cancer Affinities for Targeted Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 30, July 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of 31 types of glyconanoparticles (GlyNPs) with either homogeneous or heterogeneous display of five different sugar moieties (glucose, galactose, mannose, N&#8208;acetyl glucosamine, and N&#8208;acetyl galactosamine) is constructed to identify cancer&#8208;targeting GlyNPs for targeted cancer therapy. GlyNPCD composed of mannose/N&#8208;acetyl glucosamine targets A549 and CT26 tumors, while GlyNPABC composed of glucose/galactose/mannose targets DU145 tumors.








Abstract
Cancer&#8208;targeting ligands used for nanomedicines have been limited mostly to antibodies, peptides, aptamers, and small molecules thus far. Here, a library of glycocalyx&#8208;mimicking nanoparticles as a platform to enable screening and identification of cancer&#8208;targeting nanomedicines is reported. Specifically, a library of 31 artificial glycopolymers composed of either homogeneous or heterogeneous display of five different sugar moieties (&#946;&#8208;glucose, &#946;&#8208;galactose, &#945;&#8208;mannose, &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl glucosamine, and &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl galactosamine) is converted to a library of glyconanoparticles (GlyNPs). GlyNPs optimal for targeting CT26, DU145, A549, and PC3 tumors are systematically screened and identified. The cypate&#8208;conjugated GlyNP displaying &#945;&#8208;mannose and &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl glucosamine show selective targeting and potent photothermal therapeutic efficacy against A549 human lung tumors. The docetaxel&#8208;contained GlyNP displaying &#946;&#8208;glucose, &#946;&#8208;galactose, and &#945;&#8208;mannose demonstrate targeted chemotherapy against DU145 human prostate tumors. The results presented herein collectively demonstrate that the GlyNP library is a versatile platform enabling the identification of cancer&#8208;targeting glyconanoparticles and suggest its potential applicability for targeting various diseased cells beyond cancer.

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Pressure&#8208;Guided Superhydrophobic Surfaces with Adaptive Adhesion and Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 30, July 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A liquid&#8208;pressure&#8208;guided superhydrophobic surface (LPGSS) is designed by combining soft caps with hard skeletons. LPGSS automatically adjusts its soft cap to achieve a dynamic balance between stability and adhesion through the guidance of liquid pressure. A series of experiments demonstrate that low surface adhesion at moderate pressure and high stability at elevated pressure can be simultaneously achieved on the surface.








Abstract
The dynamic application environments of superhydrophobic surfaces, such as in the manufacturing, chemical, and garment industries, require the fast adaptiveness of the surfaces to their surroundings. Despite the progress in materials and structural design of superhydrophobic surfaces, simultaneously achieving high superhydrophobic stability and low adhesion by traditional design is still challenging. Here, a liquid&#8208;pressure&#8208;guided superhydrophobic surface with self&#8208;adjustable solid&#8211;liquid stability, and adhesion is demonstrated when reacting to the dynamic environmental requirements. To understand the underlying adaptive processes, the liquid impalement dynamics is imaged in three dimensions by confocal microscopy and the stability and superhydrophobicity are measured in varied systems. It is envisioned that the design strategy of liquid&#8208;pressure&#8208;guided superhydrophobic surfaces with dynamic anti&#8208;infiltration capability can stimulate the development of stable superhydrophobicity under complex wetting conditions.

         <title>Interface&#8208;Modulated Resistive Switching in Mo&#8208;Irradiated ReS2 for Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 30, July 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile Mo&#8208;irradiation doping is demonstrated for interfacial modulation of resistive switching (RS) in rhenium disulfide (ReS2) memristors, leading to a bipolar non&#8208;volatile switching ratio of nearly two orders of magnitude, programmable multilevel resistance states, and long&#8208;term synaptic plasticity. The device simultaneously achieves a high learning accuracy of 91% in an artificial neural network, demonstrating its potential for neuromorphic computing application.








Abstract
Coupling charge impurity scattering effects and charge&#8208;carrier modulation by doping can offer intriguing opportunities for atomic&#8208;level control of resistive switching (RS). Nonetheless, such effects have remained unexplored for memristive applications based on 2D&#160;materials. Here a facile approach is reported to transform an RS&#8208;inactive rhenium disulfide (ReS2) into an effective switching material through interfacial modulation induced by molybdenum&#8208;irradiation (Mo&#8208;i)&#160;doping. Using ReS2 as a model system, this study unveils a unique RS mechanism based on the formation/dissolution of metallic &#946;&#8208;ReO2 filament across the defective ReS2 interface during the set/reset process. Through simple interfacial modulation, ReS2 of various thicknesses are switchable by modulating the Mo&#8208;irradiation period. Besides, the Mo&#8208;irradiated ReS2 (Mo&#8208;ReS2) memristor further exhibits a bipolar non&#8208;volatile switching ratio of nearly two orders of magnitude, programmable multilevel resistance states, and long&#8208;term synaptic plasticity. Additionally, the fabricated device can achieve a high MNIST learning accuracy of 91% under a non&#8208;identical pulse train. The study's findings demonstrate the potential for modulating RS in RS&#8208;inactive 2D materials via the unique doping&#8208;induced charged impurity scattering property.

         <title>Structural Regulation of Coupled Phthalocyanine&#8211;Porphyrin Covalent Organic Frameworks to Highly Active and Selective Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 30, July 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In coupled phthalocyanine&#8211;porphyrin covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with cobalt(II) phthalocyanine as the electrocatalytic active site, the Type 1:2 COF (CoPc&#8208;2H2Por) with larger pore size and conjugation structure can more effectively boost CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) activity with lower overpotential than the Type 1:1 COF (CoPc&#8208;H2Por) due to the better mass transfer, faster electron transfer, and reaction kinetics, revealing the important role of electrocatalyst microstructure in the CO2RR.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been applied as potential electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) due to their adjustable architecture and porous feature. Herein, tetraanhydrides of 2,3,9,10,16,17,23,24&#8208;octacarboxyphthalocyanine cobalt(II) (CoTAPc) are used as nodes to couple with 5,15&#8208;di(4&#8208;aminophenyl)&#8208;10,20&#8208;diphenylporphyrin (DAPor) or 5,15,10,20&#8208;tetrayl(4&#8208;aminophenyl)porphyrin (TAPor) via imidization reaction to fabricate novel coupled phthalocyanine&#8211;porphyrin Type 1:2 (CoPc&#8208;2H2Por) or Type 1:1 (CoPc&#8208;H2Por) COFs. Electrocatalytic CO2RR experiments show that both Type 1:2 and Type 1:1 COFs exhibit the maximum Faraday efficiency over 90% with high stability, while the Type 1:2 COF (CoPc&#8208;2H2Por) delivers lower overpotential, higher current density, and CO selectivity than Type 1:1 COF (CoPc&#8208;H2Por) and CoPc monomer. Theoretical and experimental results reveal that the better CO2RR activity of CoPc&#8208;2H2Por than CoPc&#8208;H2Por can be attributed to its larger pore size and conjugate structure, which then cause more efficient electron transfer, adsorption/activation of CO2, faster mass transfer, and reaction kinetics. This work provides a new idea in the structural design of COF&#8208;based electrocatalyst for efficient CO2RR.

&lt;p&gt;In coupled phthalocyanine&#8211;porphyrin covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with cobalt(II) phthalocyanine as the electrocatalytic active site, the Type 1:2 COF (CoPc-2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Por) with larger pore size and conjugation structure can more effectively boost CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR) activity with lower overpotential than the Type 1:1 COF (CoPc-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Por) due to the better mass transfer, faster electron transfer, and reaction kinetics, revealing the important role of electrocatalyst microstructure in the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR.

         <title>Highly Curved, Quasi&#8208;Single&#8208;Crystalline Mesoporous Metal Nanoplates Promote C&#63743;C Bond Cleavage in Ethanol Oxidation Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 30, July 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly curved, 2D, quasi&#8208;single&#8208;crystalline mesoporous metal nanoplates are precisely synthesized by a facile solution route. The product features multiple structural and compositional advantages, which synergistically promote&#160;C&#63743;C bond cleavage and enable superior electrocatalytic performance in ethanol electrooxidation.








Abstract
The ability to manipulate metal nanocrystals with well&#8208;defined morphologies and structures is greatly important in material chemistry, catalysis chemistry, nanoscience, and nanotechnology. Although 2D metals serve as interesting platforms, further manipulating them in solution with highly penetrated mesopores and ideal crystallinity remains a huge challenge. Here, an easy yet powerful synthesis strategy for manipulating the mesoporous structure and crystallinity of 2D metals in a controlled manner with cetyltrimethylammonium chloride as the mesopore&#8208;forming surfactant and extra iodine&#8208;ion as the structure/facet&#8208;selective agent is reported. This strategy allows for preparing an unprecedented type of 2D quasi&#8208;single&#8208;crystalline mesoporous nanoplates (SMPs) with highly curved morphology and controlled metal composition. The products, for example, PdCu SMPs, feature abundant undercoordinated sites, optimized electronic structures, excellent electron/mass transfers, and confined mesopore environments. Curved PdCu SMPs exhibit remarkable electrocatalytic activity of 6.09&#160;A&#160;mgPd&#8722;1 and stability for ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) compared with its counterpart catalysts and commercial Pd/C. More importantly, PdCu SMPs are highly selective for EOR electrocatalysis that dramatically promotes C&#8211;C bond cleavage with a superior C1 pathway selectivity as high as 72.1%.

         <title>In Situ Synthesis of MOF&#8208;74 Family for High Areal Energy Density of Aqueous Nickel&#8211;Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 30, July 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of nickel&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) (bi/multimetallic MOF&#8208;74 family) in situ grown on carbon cloth is fabricated in application of aqueous Ni&#8211;Zn batteries.

Abstract
Limited by single metal active sites and low electrical conductivity, designing nickel&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) materials with high capacity and high energy density remains a challenge. Herein, a series of bi/multimetallic MOF&#8208;74 family materials in situ grown on carbon cloth (CC) by doping Mx+ ions in Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 is fabricated: NiM&#8208;MOF@CC (M = Mn2+, Co2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Al3+, Fe3+), and NiCoM&#8208;MOF@CC (M = Mn2+, Zn2+, Al3+, Fe3+). The type and ratio of doping metal ions can be adjusted while the original topology is preserved. Different metal ions are confirmed by X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (XAFS). Furthermore, these Ni&#8208;based MOF electrodes are directly utilized as cathodes for aqueous nickel&#8211;zinc batteries (NZBs). Among all the as&#8208;prepared electrodes, NiCo&#8208;MOF@CC&#8208;3 (NCM@CC&#8208;3), with an optimized Co/Ni ratio of 1:1, exhibits the best electrical conductivity, which is according to the density functional theory (DFT) theoretical calculations. The NCM@CC&#8208;3//Zn@CC battery achieves a high specific capacity of 1.77 mAh cm&#8211;2, a high areal energy density of 2.97 mWh cm&#8211;2, and high cycling stability of 83% capacity retention rate after 6000 cycles. The synthetic strategy based on the coordination effect of metal ions and the concept of binder&#8208;free electrodes provide a new direction for the synthesis of high&#8208;performance materials in the energy&#8208;storage field.

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Healing of Metal Oxides Assisted by Polymer&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid Materials</title>

Healing of defects in metal oxide (MeO) coatings occurs through rearrangement of Cl&#8208;decorated MeO particles formed by vapor phase infiltration inside a polymer, segregation at the defect interface, and their subsequent hydrolysis in air.








Abstract
Enabling self&#8208;healing of materials is crucially important for saving resources and energy in numerous emerging applications. While strategies for the self&#8208;healing of polymers are advanced, mechanisms for semiconducting inorganic materials are scarce due to the lack of suitable healing agents. Here a concept for the self&#8208;healing of metal oxides is developed. This concept consists of metal oxide nanoparticle growth inside the bulk of halogenated polymers and their subsequent entropy&#8208;driven migration to externally induced defect sites, leading to recovery of the defect. Herein, it is demonstrated that the pool of self&#8208;healing materials is expanded to include semiconductors, thereby increasing the reliability and sustainability of functional materials through the use of metal oxides. It is revealed that electrical properties of tin&#8208;doped indium oxide can be partially restored upon healing. Such properties are of immediate interest for the further development of transparent flexible electrodes.

         <title>Elastic Lattice Enabling Reversible Tetrahedral Li Storage Sites in a High&#8208;Capacity Manganese Oxide Cathode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 30, July 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Li&#8208;excess material based purely on manganese displaying ultrahigh capacities over hundreds of cycles is demonstrated. Through a wealth of characterization methods, it is clarified that Mn migration into the Li layer during the initial cycle stabilizes a large number of tetrahedral sites for extra and reversible Li&#8208;ion storage in this layered compound.








Abstract
The key to breaking through the capacity limitation imposed by intercalation chemistry lies in the ability to harness more active sites that can reversibly accommodate more ions (e.g., Li+) and electrons within a finite space. However, excessive Li&#8208;ion insertion into the Li layer of layered cathodes results in fast performance decay due to the huge lattice change and irreversible phase transformation.

     alt="Elastic Lattice Enabling Reversible Tetrahedral Li Storage Sites in a High-Capacity Manganese Oxide Cathode"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Li-excess material based purely on manganese displaying ultrahigh capacities over hundreds of cycles is demonstrated. Through a wealth of characterization methods, it is clarified that Mn migration into the Li layer during the initial cycle stabilizes a large number of tetrahedral sites for extra and reversible Li-ion storage in this layered compound.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to breaking through the capacity limitation imposed by intercalation chemistry lies in the ability to harness more active sites that can reversibly accommodate more ions (e.g., Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and electrons within a finite space. However, excessive Li-ion insertion into the Li layer of layered cathodes results in fast performance decay due to the huge lattice change and irreversible phase transformation. In this study, an ultrahigh reversible capacity is demonstrated by a layered oxide cathode purely based on manganese. Through a wealth of characterizations, it is clarified that the presence of low-content Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;MnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; domains not only reduces the amount of irreversible O loss; but also regulates Mn migration in LiMnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; domains, enabling elastic lattice with high reversibility for tetrahedral sites Li-ion storage in Li layers. This work utilizes bulk cation disorder to create stable Li-ion-storage tetrahedral sites and an elastic lattice for layered materials, with a reversible capacity of 600&#160;mA h g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, demonstrated in th range 0.6&#8211;4.9&#160;V versus Li/Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; at 10&#160;mA g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Admittedly, discharging to 0.6&#160;V might be too low for practical use, but this exploration is still of great importance as it conceptually demonstrates the limit of Li-ions insertion into layered oxide materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Short&#8208;Range Diffusion Enables General Synthesis of Medium&#8208;Entropy Alloy Aerogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 30, July 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general short&#8208;range diffusion driving strategy for preparing ultralight 3D porous medium entropy aerogels (MEAAs) is proposed to achieve highly efficient methanol oxidation electrocatalysis. The well&#8208;designed MEAAs can be used for a methanol&#8208;oxidation&#8208;assisted water electrolyzer with a low cell voltage of 1.476&#160;V, not only greatly reducing the overpotential of the traditional alkaline water electrolyzer, but also obtaining value&#8208;added formate products at anode.








Abstract
Medium&#8208;entropy alloy aerogels (MEAAs) with the advantages of both multimetallic alloys and aerogels are promising new materials in catalytic applications. However, limited by the immiscible behavior of different metals, achieving single&#8208;phase MEAAs is still a grand challenge. Herein, a general strategy for preparing ultralight 3D porous MEAAs with the lowest density of 39.3 mg cm&#8722;3 among the metal materials is reported, through combining auto&#8208;combustion and subsequent low&#8208;temperature reduction procedures. The homogenous mixing of precursors at the ionic level makes the short&#8208;range diffusion of metal atoms possible to drive the formation of single&#8208;phase MEAAs. As a proof of concept in catalysis, as&#8208;synthesized Ni50Co15Fe30Cu5 MEAAs exhibit a high mass activity of 1.62 A mg&#8722;1 and specific activity of 132.24 mA cm&#8722;2 toward methanol oxidation reactions, much higher than those of the low&#8208;entropy counterparts. In situ Fourier transform infrared and NMR spectroscopies reveal that MEAAs can enable highly selective conversion of methanol to formate. Most importantly, a methanol&#8208;oxidation&#8208;assisted MEAAs&#8208;based water electrolyzer can achieve a low cell voltage of 1.476 V at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 for making value&#8208;added formate at the anode and H2 at the cathode, 173 mV lower than that of traditional alkaline water electrolyzers.

         <title>Raman Scattering Measurement of Suspended Graphene under Extreme Strain Induced by Nanoindentation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 30, July 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
High strains are applied to single&#8208;layer graphene by an atomic force microscopy (AFM) tip and the Raman signals are obtained simultaneously using a Raman&#8211;AFM system. Graphene is stretched up to 6.1% and the G and 2D bands of Raman signal are shifted by 277 and 660 cm&#8722;1 respectively, which are unprecedented values.








Abstract
Graphene is known as a superstiff and extremely strong material. Hence, applying strains greater than 1% to graphene and simultaneously measuring changes in its physical properties has been challenging because of the limited methodologies for measuring both high strain and other physical properties. Here, Raman scattering measurement of suspended graphene under extremely high biaxial strain as large as 6.1% using an atomic force microscopy (AFM)&#8211;Raman spectroscopy measurement tool is reported. Nanoindentation is performed using AFM tips machined to have a flat top and a hole shape, resulting in a strained graphene area sufficiently large to enable the acquisition of a Raman signal. At the same time, the laser light is focused on the strained flat area of the graphene membrane. The Raman signals of the G and 2D bands of graphene are redshifted by 282 and 684 cm&#8722;1, respectively, which is unprecedented for graphene. This measurement technique provides an effective methodology to measure variations in the physical properties of atomically thin materials under superhigh strain.

         <title>Sb2Se3 Thin&#8208;Film Solar Cells Exceeding 10% Power Conversion Efficiency Enabled by Injection Vapor Deposition Technology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 30, July 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An injection vapor deposition (IVD) technology is designed and demonstrated. The IVD produces compact antimony selenide (Sb2Se3) films with high orientation preference, fewer deep&#8208;level trap levels, and suppressed non&#8208;radiative recombination, achieving a record power conversion efficiency of 10.12% for Sb2Se3 photovoltaics.








Abstract
Binary Sb2Se3 semiconductors are promising as the absorber materials in inorganic chalcogenide compound photovoltaics due to their attractive anisotropic optoelectronic properties. However, Sb2Se3 solar cells suffer from complex and unconventional intrinsic defects due to the low symmetry of the quasi&#8208;1D crystal structure resulting in a considerable voltage deficit, which limits the ultimate power conversion efficiency (PCE). In this work, the creation of compact Sb2Se3 films with strong [00l] orientation, high crystallinity, minimal deep level defect density, fewer trap states, and low non&#8208;radiative recombination loss by injection vapor deposition is reported. This deposition technique enables superior films compared with close&#8208;spaced sublimation and coevaporation technologies. The resulting Sb2Se3 thin&#8208;film solar cells yield a PCE of 10.12%, owing to the suppressed carrier recombination and excellent carrier transport and extraction. This method thus opens a new and effective avenue for the fabrication of high&#8208;quality Sb2Se3 and other high&#8208;quality chalcogenide semiconductors.

         <title>Surface Oxygen Vacancies Confined by Ferroelectric Polarization for Tunable CO Oxidation Kinetics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 30, July 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface oxygen vacancies are well confined near the interface between Pt {111} nanocrystals and the negative polar surface (001) of ferroelectric PbTiO3 nanoplate. The vacancies are stabilized electrostatically by ferroelectric polarization, giving rise to tunable catalytic CO oxidation kinetics from 200&#160;&#176;C to near room temperature. A new pathway of CO oxidation via polarization&#8208;stabilized oxygen vacancies accounts for the tunable reaction activity.








Abstract
Surface oxygen vacancies have been widely discussed to be crucial for tailoring the activity of various chemical reactions from CO, NO, to water oxidation by using oxide&#8208;supported catalysts. However, the real role and potential function of surface oxygen vacancies in the reaction remains unclear because of their very short lifetime. Here, it is reported that surface oxygen vacancies can be well confined electrostatically for a polarization screening near the perimeter interface between Pt {111} nanocrystals and the negative polar surface (001) of ferroelectric PbTiO3. Strikingly, such a catalyst demonstrates a tunable catalytic CO oxidation kinetics from 200&#160;&#176;C to near room temperature by increasing the O2 gas pressure, accompanied by the conversion curve from a hysteresis&#8208;free loop to one with hysteresis. The combination of reaction kinetics, electronic energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) analysis, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, indicates that the oxygen vacancies stabilized by the negative polar surface are the active sites for O2 adsorption as a rate&#8208;determining step, and then dissociated O moves to the surface of the Pt nanocrystals for oxidizing adsorbed CO. The results open a new pathway for tunable catalytic activity of CO oxidation.

&lt;p&gt;Surface oxygen vacancies have been widely discussed to be crucial for tailoring the activity of various chemical reactions from CO, NO, to water oxidation by using oxide-supported catalysts. However, the real role and potential function of surface oxygen vacancies in the reaction remains unclear because of their very short lifetime. Here, it is reported that surface oxygen vacancies can be well confined electrostatically for a polarization screening near the perimeter interface between Pt {111} nanocrystals and the negative polar surface (001) of ferroelectric PbTiO&lt;sub&gt;3.&lt;/sub&gt; Strikingly, such a catalyst demonstrates a tunable catalytic CO oxidation kinetics from 200&#160;&#176;C to near room temperature by increasing the O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas pressure, accompanied by the conversion curve from a hysteresis-free loop to one with hysteresis. The combination of reaction kinetics, electronic energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) analysis, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, indicates that the oxygen vacancies stabilized by the negative polar surface are the active sites for O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption as a rate-determining step, and then dissociated O moves to the surface of the Pt nanocrystals for oxidizing adsorbed CO. The results open a new pathway for tunable catalytic activity of CO oxidation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The fusion of 2D transition&#8208;metal&#8208;dichalcogenide materials with micro/nanomachines can substantially accelerate scientific discovery and engineering implementations for micro/nanorobotics. Here, functional molybdenum disulfide is integrated into Janus micromotors that demonstrate unprecedented performance in response to ion addition and application for water disinfection. The unveiled working mechanism points toward a new scheme for making micro/nanomachines with designed performance.








Abstract
2D&#160;transition&#8208;metal&#8208;dichalcogenide&#160;materials, such as molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) have received immense interest owing to their remarkable structure&#8208;endowed electronic, catalytic, and mechanical properties for applications in optoelectronics, energy storage, and wearable devices. However, 2D materials have been rarely explored in the field of micro/nanomachines, motors, and robots. Here, MoS2&#160;with anatase TiO2&#160;is successfully integrated into an original one&#8208;side&#8208;open hollow micromachine, which demonstrates increased light absorption of TiO2&#8208;based micromachines to the visible region and the first observed motion acceleration in response to ionic media. Both experimentation and theoretical analysis suggest the unique type&#8208;II bandgap alignment of MoS2/TiO2&#160;heterojunction that accounts for the observed unique locomotion owing to a competing propulsion mechanism. Furthermore, by leveraging the chemical properties of MoS2/TiO2, the micromachines achieve sunlight&#8208;powered water disinfection with 99.999%&#160;Escherichia coli&#160;lysed in an&#160;hour. This research suggests abundant opportunities offered by 2D materials in the creation of a new class of micro/nanomachines and robots.

         <dc:description>
A novel electrocatalyst, Pt3Ge, engineered with a desired crystallographic facet (202) accelerates the hydrogen production by water electrolysis and records industrially desired operational stability over a wide range of pH compared to the commercial catalyst platinum on carbon.

Abstract
The discovery of novel materials for industrial&#8208;standard hydrogen production is the present need considering the global energy infrastructure. A novel electrocatalyst, Pt3Ge, which is engineered with a desired crystallographic facet (202), accelerates hydrogen production by water electrolysis, and records industrially desired operational stability compared to the commercial catalyst platinum is introduced. Pt3Ge&#8208;(202) exhibits low overpotential of 21.7 mV (24.6 mV for Pt/C) and 92 mV for 10 and 200 mA cm&#8722;2 current density, respectively in 0.5 m H2SO4. It also exhibits remarkable stability of 15&#160;000 accelerated degradation tests cycles (5000 for Pt/C) and exceptional durability of 500 h (@10 mA cm&#8722;2) in acidic media. Pt3Ge&#8208;(202) also displays low overpotential of 96 mV for 10 mA cm&#8722;2 current density in the alkaline medium, rationalizing its hydrogen production ability over a wide pH range required commercial operations. Long&#8208;term durability (&gt;75 h in alkaline media) with the industrial level current density (&gt;500 mA cm&#8722;2) has been demonstrated by utilizing the electrochemical flow reactor. The driving force behind this stupendous performance of Pt3Ge&#8208;(202) has been envisaged by mapping the reaction mechanism, active sites, and charge&#8208;transfer kinetics via controlled electrochemical experiments, ex situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, in situ infrared spectroscopy, and in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy further corroborated by first principles calculations.

         <title>Stable Solid Electrolyte Interphase In Situ Formed on Magnesium&#8208;Metal Anode by using a Perfluorinated Alkoxide&#8208;Based All&#8208;Magnesium Salt Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 30, July 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A perfluorinated alkoxide&#8208;based all&#8208;magnesium salt electrolyte is designed and synthesized. The proper lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy level of the [Mg(pftb)3]&#8722; anions in the electrolyte enables in situ formation of a stable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) on Mg anodes. With the protection of SEI, Mg//Mg cells achieve low overpotentials over ultralong&#8208;cycle lives of 8100, 3000, and 1500 h at current densities of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, respectively.








Abstract
Passivation of the Mg anode surface in conventional electrolytes constitutes a critical issue for practical Mg batteries. In this work, a perfluorinated tert&#8208;butoxide magnesium salt, Mg(pftb)2, is codissolved with MgCl2 in tetrahydrofuran (THF) to form an all&#8208;magnesium salt electrolyte. Raman spectroscopy and density function theory calculation confirm that [Mg2Cl3&#183;6THF]+[Mg(pftb)3]&#8722; is the main electrochemically active species of the electrolyte. The proper lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy level of the [Mg(pftb)3]&#8722; anion enables in situ formation of a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on Mg anodes. A detailed analysis of the SEI reveals that its stability originates from a dual&#8208;layered organic/inorganic hybrid structure. Mg//Cu and Mg//Mg cells using the electrolyte achieve a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.7% over 3000 cycles, and low overpotentials over ultralong&#8208;cycle lives of 8100, 3000, and 1500 h at current densities of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, respectively. The robust SEI layer, once formed on a Mg electrode, is also shown highly effective in suppressing side&#8208;reactions in a TFSI&#8722;&#8208;containing electrolyte. A high Coulombic efficiency of 99.5% over 800 cycles is also demonstrated for a Mg//Mo6S8 full cell, showing great promise of the SEI forming electrolyte in future Mg batteries.

         <title>Conductive Ink with Circular Life Cycle for Printed Electronics</title>

The recyclability and sustainability of printed electronics have important design aspects in reducing the costs and environmental burden of electronic waste. Enzymatic degradation can be considered, but resource&#8208;intensive purification of enzymes limits scalability, and their stability is uncertain under electrical voltage and long&#8208;term storage. By employing a customized enzyme protectant, the ink can be disintegrated and recycled in warm water.








Abstract
Electronic waste carries energetic costs and an environmental burden rivaling that of plastic waste due to the rarity and toxicity of the heavy&#8208;metal components. Recyclable conductive composites are introduced for printed circuits formulated with polycaprolactone (PCL), conductive fillers, and enzyme/protectant nanoclusters. Circuits can be printed with flexibility (breaking strain &#8776;80%) and conductivity (&#8776;2.1&#160;&#215; 104 S m&#8722;1). These composites are degraded at the end of life by immersion in warm water with programmable latency. Approximately 94% of the functional fillers can be recycled and reused with similar device performance. The printed circuits remain functional and degradable after shelf storage for at least 7 months at room temperature and one month of continuous operation under electrical voltage. The present studies provide composite design toward recyclable and easily disposable printed electronics for applications such as wearable electronics, biosensors, and soft robotics.

By employing a customized enzyme protectant, the ink can be disintegrated and recycled in warm water.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electronic waste carries energetic costs and an environmental burden rivaling that of plastic waste due to the rarity and toxicity of the heavy-metal components. Recyclable conductive composites are introduced for printed circuits formulated with polycaprolactone (PCL), conductive fillers, and enzyme/protectant nanoclusters. Circuits can be printed with flexibility (breaking strain &#8776;80%) and conductivity (&#8776;2.1&#160;&#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; S m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). These composites are degraded at the end of life by immersion in warm water with programmable latency. Approximately 94% of the functional fillers can be recycled and reused with similar device performance. The printed circuits remain functional and degradable after shelf storage for at least 7 months at room temperature and one month of continuous operation under electrical voltage. The present studies provide composite design toward recyclable and easily disposable printed electronics for applications such as wearable electronics, biosensors, and soft robotics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Cell&#8208;in&#8208;catalytic&#8208;shell biohybrid structures are constructed by in situ supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of Fe3+ and benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxylic acid, with concomitant enzyme embedment. The Fe3+&#8208;BTC nanoshells on individual living cells enhance the catalytic efficiency of multienzymatic cascade reactions by confining the reaction intermediates to the internal voids and impart extrinsic functions to the cells beyond the scope of biological evolution.








Abstract
Cell&#8208;in&#8208;shell biohybrid structures, synthesized by encapsulating individual living cells with exogenous materials, have emerged as exciting functional entities for engineered living materials, with emergent properties outside the scope of biochemical modifications. Artificial exoskeletons have, to date, provided physicochemical shelters to the cells inside in the first stage of technological development, and further advances in the field demand catalytically empowered, cellular hybrid systems that augment the biological functions of cells and even introduce completely new functions to the cells. This work describes a facile and generalizable strategy for empowering living cells with extrinsic catalytic capability through nanoencapsulation of living cells with a supramolecular metal&#8211;organic complex of Fe3+ and benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxylic acid (BTC). A series of enzymes are embedded in situ, without loss of catalytic activity, in the Fe3+&#8208;BTC shells, not to mention the superior characteristics of cytocompatible and rapid shell&#8208;forming processes. The nanoshell enhances the catalytic efficiency of multienzymatic cascade reactions by confining reaction intermediates to its internal voids and the nanoencapsulated cells acquire exogenous biochemical functions, including enzymatic cleavage of lethal octyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glucopyranoside into d&#8208;glucose, with autonomous cytoprotection. The system will provide a versatile, nanoarchitectonic tool for interfacing biological cells with functional materials, especially for catalytic bioempowerment of living cells.

         <title>An Intracellular Self&#8208;Assembly&#8208;Driven Uninterrupted ROS Generator Augments 5&#8208;Aminolevulinic&#8208;Acid&#8208;Based Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 30, July 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the natural biotransformation of 5&#8208;aminolevulinic acid (ALA) (ALA&#8208;PpIX&#8208;heme), an intracellular self&#8208;assembly&#8208;driven uninterrupted reactive oxygen species (ROS) generator (URG) is developed for amplified tumor therapy. The URG can not only generate 1O2 under laser irradiation, but also converts useless heme into peroxidase mimics via intracellular self&#8208;assembly, which can effectively catalyze H2O2 to &#8226;OH, thus realizing &#8220;1O2&#8722;&#8226;OH&#8221; uninterrupted ROS generation.








Abstract
Free radical therapy based on 5&#8208;aminolevulinic acid (ALA, a precursor of the photosensitizer protoporphyrin IX (PpIX)) has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for clinical tumor treatment. However, PpIX can be quickly converted into photoinactive heme, leading to unexpectedly paused production of free radicals and severely hindering its therapeutic benefits. Here, inspired by the natural biotransformation of ALA (ALA&#8208;PpIX&#8208;heme), an uninterrupted reactive oxygen species generator (URG) that converts useless heme to peroxidase mimics via intracellular self&#8208;assembly is developed. The URG is prepared by enwrapping ALA&#8208;loaded polyamide&#8208;amine dendrimers in red blood cell membrane vesicles with a further surface modification of G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;structured AS1411. The URGs realize &#8220;1O2&#8722;&#8226;OH&#8221; uninterrupted generation through &#8220;recycling waste&#8221; in two steps: i) PpIX generates 1O2 under laser irradiation; and ii) the photoinactive metabolite heme self&#8208;assembled with AS1411 to catalyze H2O2 conversion into &#8226;OH. Interestingly, the specific generation of 1O2 in mitochondria and &#8226;OH in nuclei further augments the free&#8208;radical&#8208;induced damage. It is demonstrated that URG can continuously produce free radicals for 6 h postirradiation, and shows 3.3&#8208;times more than that of the nonassembly group, achieving nearly 80% regression of tumors in vivo.

         <title>Biaxially Compressive Strain in Ni/Ru Core/Shell Nanoplates Boosts Li&#8211;CO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 30, July 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biaxially compressive strained nickel/ruthenium core/shell hexagonal nanoplates are developed as advanced catalysts to boost the performance of lithium&#8211;carbon dioxide batteries. It is demonstrated that strain effect can tune the electronic structure of ruthenium, which makes the strained ruthenium shell energetically beneficial for the nucleation and decomposition of lithium carbonate crystals.








Abstract
Regulating surface strain of nanomaterials is an effective strategy to manipulate the activity of catalysts, yet not well recognized in rechargeable Li&#8211;CO2 batteries. Herein, biaxially compressive strained nickel/ruthenium core/shell hexagonal nanoplates (Ni/Ru HNPs) with lattice compression of &#8776;5.1% and &#8776;3.2% in the Ru {10&#8722;10} and (0002) facets are developed as advanced catalysts for Li&#8211;CO2 batteries. It is demonstrated that tuning the electronic structure of Ru shell through biaxially compressive strain engineering can boost the kinetically sluggish CO2 reduction and evolution reactions, thus achieving a high&#8208;performance Li&#8211;CO2 battery with low charge platform/overpotential (3.75&#160;V/0.88&#160;V) and ultralong cycling life (120 cycles at 200&#160;mA g&#8722;1 with a fixed capacity of 1000 mAh g&#8722;1). Density functional theory calculations reveal that the biaxially compressive strain can downshift the d&#8208;band center of surface Ru atoms and thus weaken the binding of CO2 molecules, which is energetically beneficial for the nucleation and decomposition of Li2CO3 crystals during the discharge and charge processes. This study confirms that strain engineering, though constructing a well&#8208;defined core/shell structure, is a promising strategy to improve the inherent catalytic activity of Ru&#8208;based materials in Li&#8211;CO2 batteries.

         <title>An All&#8208;Organic Self&#8208;Powered Photodetector with Ultraflexible Dual&#8208;Polarity Output for Biosignal Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 30, July 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An all&#8208;organic self&#8208;powered photodetector with ultraflexibility and dual&#8208;polarity output is successfully fabricated by an all&#8208;solution method, which is expected to have great application potential in realizing multifunctional, portable, and wearable electronic devices.








Abstract
Endowing photodetectors with mechanically flexibility and actual functionality are current research issues in developing optoelectronic devices. However, rigid metal&#8208;based or metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;based electrodes remain a block to the realization of ultraflexible electronics. Thus, an ultraflexible all&#8208;organic photodetector (all&#8208;OPD) is designed by innovatively introducing symmetrical organic electrodes PH1000/PH1000 to substitute the widely applied indium&#8208;doped tin oxide (ITO)/Ag electrodes. Specifically, this all&#8208;OPD exhibits a high self&#8208;powered responsivity (R) of over 100&#160;mA W&#8722;1 among 500&#8211;600&#160;nm and the photocurrent remains about 80% of the original performance after being bent 20&#160;000 circles, and can output steady biosignals for photo&#8208;plethysmography (PPG) application. More importantly, this all&#8208;OPD outputs dual&#8208;polarity photocurrent as it is flipped or folded. Benefitting from the ordered phase distribution and designed Schottky barrier heights, the photogenerated holes will be transferred and collected by nearer electrode, while electrons will be trapped in the thick bulk heterojunction (BHJ) as a result of the long channel. This work offers a new avenue toward developing a multifunctional and ultraflexible all&#8208;OPD with a straightforward all&#8208;solution method, and it is expected to be more compatible in complex application scenarios.

&lt;p&gt;An all-organic self-powered photodetector with ultraflexibility and dual-polarity output is successfully fabricated by an all-solution method, which is expected to have great application potential in realizing multifunctional, portable, and wearable electronic devices.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Endowing photodetectors with mechanically flexibility and actual functionality are current research issues in developing optoelectronic devices. However, rigid metal-based or metal-oxide-based electrodes remain a block to the realization of ultraflexible electronics. Thus, an ultraflexible all-organic photodetector (all-OPD) is designed by innovatively introducing symmetrical organic electrodes PH1000/PH1000 to substitute the widely applied indium-doped tin oxide (ITO)/Ag electrodes. Specifically, this all-OPD exhibits a high self-powered responsivity (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;) of over 100&#160;mA W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; among 500&#8211;600&#160;nm and the photocurrent remains about 80% of the original performance after being bent 20&#160;000 circles, and can output steady biosignals for photo-plethysmography (PPG) application. More importantly, this all-OPD outputs dual-polarity photocurrent as it is flipped or folded. Benefitting from the ordered phase distribution and designed Schottky barrier heights, the photogenerated holes will be transferred and collected by nearer electrode, while electrons will be trapped in the thick bulk heterojunction (BHJ) as a result of the long channel. This work offers a new avenue toward developing a multifunctional and ultraflexible all-OPD with a straightforward all-solution method, and it is expected to be more compatible in complex application scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Phonon Symphony of Stacked Multilayers and Weak Bonds Lowers Lattice Thermal Conductivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 30, July 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new chalcogenide, Ga6Cr5Se16, shows intrinsic low lattice thermal conductivity (0.79 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1) at 323 K, which is almost four times lower than that of binary Cr3Se4), or twice lower than that of Cr2Se3 and Ga2Se3. This work provides a comprehensive understanding of the phonon propagation in layered chalcogenides, elucidates a direction for the rational design of multilayer stacking in solids with low &#954;lat.








Abstract
Controlling lattice vibrations to obtain intrinsic low thermal conductivity play a critical role in thermal management of electronic and photonic devices, energy converters, and thermal insulation, which necessitates exploring new compounds and a thorough understanding of their chemical structure, bonding, and lattice dynamics. Herein, a new chalcogenide, Ga6Cr5Se16, shows intrinsic low lattice thermal conductivity &#954;lat, which crystallizes in the monoclinic phase (C2/m) with the stacked inverse GaSe4 layers (g'), close&#8208;packed Cr3+Se6 layers (c), GaSe4 layers (g) and loosely&#8208;stacked Cr2+Se6 layers (c') along the c&#8208;axis. In this structure, a wide variety of chemical bonding is arranged in each layer, such as covalent Ga&#8211;Se, covalent Cr3+&#8211;Se, and weaker Cr2+&#8211;Se bonding, which endow it with a large phonon symphony by strong coupling of soft acoustic and low&#8208;lying optical phonons. As a result, Ga6Cr5Se16 realizes an intrinsic low &#954;lat of 0.79 W m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;1 at 323 K, which is almost four times, or twice lower than that of Cr3Se4 (2.95 W m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;1), or Cr2Se3 (1.56 W m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;1), Ga2Se3 (1.36 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1) at 323 K, respectively. These insights will offer comprehensive understanding of the phonon propagation in complex layered chalcogenides, and&#160;also shed useful light on future design of low&#8208;&#954;lat solids.

         <title>Polarity&#8208;Differentiated Dielectric Materials in Monolayer Graphene Charge&#8208;Regulated Field&#8208;Effect Transistors for an Artificial Reflex Arc and Pain&#8208;Modulation System of the Spinal Cord</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 30, July 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charge&#8208;regulated field&#8208;effect transistors (CRFETs) with polarity&#8208;differentiated dielectric materials and a monolayer graphene channel are developed to mimic a reflex arc and pain modulation system of the spinal cord. By integrating actuators and memristors with CRFETs, reflex actions and pain sensation under noxious stimuli are realized, offering a new method to emulate the functionalities of the nervous system.








Abstract
The nervous system is a vital part of organisms to survive and it endows them with remarkable abilities, such as perception, recognition, regulation, learning, and decision&#8208;making, by intertwining myriad neurons. To realize such outstanding efficacies and functions, many artificial devices and systems have been investigated to emulate the operating principles of the nervous system. Here, an artificial reflex arc (ARA) and artificial pain modulation system (APMS) are proposed to imitate the unconscious behaviors of the spinal cord. GdxOy&#8208; and AlxOy&#8208;based charge&#8208;regulated field&#8208;effect transistors (CRFETs) with a monolayer graphene channel are fabricated and adopted as inhibitory and excitatory synapses, respectively, under the same pulse signals to mimic the biological reflex arc through a connection with a poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;trifluoroethylene)&#8208;based actuator. Additionally, a memristor is integrated with a CRFET as the interneuron to regulate the Dirac point by controlling the voltage drop on the graphene channel, analogous to the descending pain&#8208;inhibition system in the spinal cord, to prevent excessive pain perception. The proposed ARA and APMS provide a significant step forward to realizing the functions of the nervous system, giving promising potential for developing future intelligent alarm systems, neuroprosthetics, and neurorobotics.

         <title>Multichannel Superposition of Grafted Perfect Vortex Beams</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 30, July 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single metasurface is used to generate various grafted perfect vortex beams and realize the coaxial superpositions of these beams in different channels, without relying on the complicated conventional optical setup. A compact metasurface platform can perform a sophisticated task that is nearly impossible with conventional optics, opening opportunities for emerging application areas, such as singular optics and quantum science.








Abstract
Inspired by plant grafting, grafted vortex beams can be formed through grafting two or more helical phase profiles of optical vortex beams. Recently, grafted perfect vortex beams (GPVBs) have attracted much attention due to their unique optical properties and potential applications. However, the current method to generate and manipulate GPVBs requires a complex and bulky optical system, hindering further investigation and limiting its practical applications. Here, a compact metasurface approach for generating and manipulating GPVBs in multiple channels is proposed and demonstrated, which eliminates the need for such a complex optical setup. A single metasurface is utilized to realize various superpositions of GPVBs with different combinations of topological charges in four channels, leading to asymmetric singularity distributions. The positions of singularities in the superimposed beam can be further modulated by introducing an initial phase difference in the metasurface design. The work demonstrates a compact metasurface platform that performs a sophisticated optical task that is very challenging with conventional optics, opening opportunities for the investigation and applications of GPVBs in a wide range of emerging application areas, such as singular optics and quantum science.

Cancer Therapy
As glycocalyx&#8208;directed binding interactions are prevalent in cancer cells and are used for cell&#8211;cell communication and cell adhesion through carbohydrate&#8208;mediated interactions, Hee&#8208;Seung Lee, Sangyong Jon, and co&#8208;workers have developed a nanomedicine platform based on a library of glycocalyx&#8208;mimicking nanoparticles that enables screening and identification of cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;selective glyconanoparticles, as described in article number 2203993. This work demonstrates the potential of the glycocalyx&#8208;mimicking nanoparticle platform for use in targeted cancer therapy.

         <title>Thin&#8208;Film Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 30, July 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Over the last 30 years, studies of epitaxial thin&#8208;film ferroelectrics have driven advances in the synthesis, characterization, and understanding of ferroelectric polarization, realizing new ferroelectric order, ferroelectric materials, and applications. A broad look at the field of thin&#8208;film ferroelectrics is provided, connecting early questions motivating researchers to open questions for the coming decades.








Abstract
Over the last 30 years, the study of ferroelectric oxides has been revolutionized by the implementation of epitaxial&#8208;thin&#8208;film&#8208;based studies, which have driven many advances in the understanding of ferroelectric physics and the realization of novel polar structures and functionalities. New questions have motivated the development of advanced synthesis, characterization, and simulations of epitaxial thin films and, in turn, have provided new insights and applications across the micro&#8208;, meso&#8208;, and macroscopic length scales. This review traces the evolution of ferroelectric thin&#8208;film research through the early days developing understanding of the roles of size and strain on ferroelectrics to the present day, where such understanding is used to create complex hierarchical domain structures, novel polar topologies, and controlled chemical and defect profiles. The extension of epitaxial techniques, coupled with advances in high&#8208;throughput simulations, now stands to accelerate the discovery and study of new ferroelectric materials. Coming hand&#8208;in&#8208;hand with these new materials is new understanding and control of ferroelectric functionalities. Today, researchers are actively working to apply these lessons in a number of applications, including novel memory and logic architectures, as well as a host of energy conversion devices.

State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art biosensors successfully assist differentiative diagnosis and screening of viral pathogens and related biomarkers for facilitating the pandemic management worldwide. This review sheds light upon various biosensing technologies mainly from a material perspective by evaluating their analytical performance and suitability for point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing. Moreover, current challenges, opportunities, and future trends of biosensors regarding on&#8208;site management of next pandemics are discussed.








Abstract
Several viral infectious diseases appear limitless since the beginning of the 21st century, expanding into pandemic lengths. Thus, there are extensive efforts to provide more efficient means of diagnosis, a better understanding of acquired immunity, and improved monitoring of inflammatory biomarkers, as these are all crucial for controlling the spread of infection while aiding in vaccine development and improving patient outcomes. In this regard, various biosensors have been developed recently to streamline pathogen and immune response detection by addressing the limitations of traditional methods, including isothermal amplification&#8208;based systems and lateral flow assays. This review explores state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art biosensors for detecting viral pathogens, serological assays, and inflammatory biomarkers from the material perspective, by discussing their advantages, limitations, and further potential regarding their analytical performance, clinical utility, and point&#8208;of&#8208;care adaptability. Additionally, next&#8208;generation biosensing technologies that offer better sensitivity and selectivity, and easy handling for end&#8208;users are highlighted. An emerging example of these next&#8208;generation biosensors are those powered by novel synthetic biology tools, such as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) with CRISPR&#8208;associated proteins (Cas), in combination with integrated point&#8208;of&#8208;care devices. Lastly, the current challenges are discussed and a roadmap for furthering these advanced biosensing technologies to manage future pandemics is provided.

         <dc:description>
The cycling stability and rate performance of Li&#8211;S batteries are adversely affected by the formation of Li dendrites and the polysulfide shuttle effect. Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) can effectively guide Li deposition and suppress polysulfide migration, thus holding great promise for Li&#8211;S batteries. The recent progress in the development of SACs for Li&#8211;S batteries is systematically summarized and analyzed.








Abstract
Although lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries are promising next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;storage systems, their practical applications are limited by the growth of Li dendrites and lithium polysulfide shuttling. These problems can be mitigated through the use of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), which exhibit the advantages of maximal atom utilization efficiency (&#8776;100%) and unique catalytic properties, thus effectively enhancing the performance of electrode materials in energy&#8208;storage devices. This review systematically summarizes the recent progress in SACs intended for use in Li&#8208;metal anodes, S cathodes, and separators, briefly introducing the operating principles of Li&#8211;S batteries, the action mechanisms of the corresponding SACs, and the fundamentals of SACs activity, and then comprehensively describes the main strategies for SACs synthesis. Subsequently, the applications of SACs and the principles of SACs operation in reinforced Li&#8211;S batteries as well as other metal&#8211;S batteries are individually illustrated, and the major challenges of SACs usage in Li&#8211;S batteries as well as future development directions are presented.

Abstract
Engineering surface structure can precisely and effectively tune optoelectronic properties of halide perovskites, but are incredibly challenging. Herein, we report the design and fabrication of uniform all&#8211;inorganic CsPbBr3 cubes/tetrahedrons single&#8208;crystals with precise control of (100) and (111) surface anisotropy, respectively. By combining theoretical calculations, we demonstrated that the preferred (100) surface engineering of CsPbBr3 single&#8208;crystals enables a lowest surface bandgap energy (2.33&#160;eV) and high&#8208;rate carrier mobility up to 241 &#956;m2 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1, inherently boosting their light&#8208;harvesting and carrier transport capability. Whereas, the polar (111) surface induces &#8764;0.16&#160;eV upward surface&#8208;band bending and ultrahigh surface defect density of 1.49 &#215; 1015 cm&#8211;3, which is beneficial for enhancing surface defects&#8208;catalyzed reactions. Our work highlights the anisotropic surface engineering for boosting perovskite optoelectronic devices and beyond.

This study presents new insights into biodegradable near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II fluorescence theranostic nanoparticles by coassembling a self&#8208;sacrificially biodegradable pseudo&#8208;conjugated&#8208;polymer as well as an amphiphilic polyester with doxorubicin via reactive oxygen species responsive thioketal linkages for photodynamic immunotherapy and photoactivated chemotherapy.








Abstract
Semiconducting polymers (SP) hold great promise for cancer phototherapy due to their excellent optical properties; however, their clinical application is still hampered by their poor biodegradability. Herein, a self&#8208;sacrificially biodegradable pseudo&#8208;semiconducting polymer (PSP) for NIR&#8208;II fluorescence bioimaging, photodynamic immunotherapy, and photoactivated chemotherapy (PACT) is reported. The PSP can further co&#8208;assemble with an amphiphilic polyester with pendant doxorubicin (DOX) in its side chains via reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive thioketal linkages (PEDOX), which are denoted as NP@PEDOX/PSP. The NP@PEDOX/PSP can accumulate at tumor sites and generate&#160;ROS&#160;for photodynamic immunotherapy as well as near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II fluorescence (NIR&#8208;II) for bioimaging upon irradition at 808 nm. The ROS could break up thioketal linkages in PEDOX, resulting in rapid doxorubicin (DOX) release for PACT. Finally, both PEDOX and PSP are degraded sacrificially by intracellular glutathione (GSH), resulting in the dissociation of NP@PEDOX/PSP. This work highlights the application of self&#8208;sacrificially degradable PSP for NIR&#8208;II fluorescence bioimaging, photodynamic immunotherapy, and PACT in cancer therapy.

         <title>Complement&#8208;Opsonized NIR&#8208;IIb Emissive Immunotracers for Dynamically Monitoring Neutrophils in Inflammation&#8208;Related Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Complement C3 opsonized near&#8208;infrared&#8208;IIb emissive immunotracers are captured by inflammation&#8208;stimulated neutrophils in circulatory blood through complement&#8208;receptors&#8208;mediated phagocytosis, enabling dynamically monitoring neutrophils during cutaneous wound healing and cerebral ischemia/reperfusion. The strategy of modulating surface chemistry of nanosized imaging agents to enhance complement C3 opsonization provides a new insight to develop immunotracers for in vivo labeling and tracking neutrophils.








Abstract
Real&#8208;time monitoring of neutrophil dynamics is crucial for timely diagnosis and effective treatment of inflammation&#8208;related diseases, which requires a reliable tracer for in vivo tracking of neutrophils. However, immunotracers for neutrophils are extremely limited because of the difficulty in labeling the cells. Inspired by the natural biological function of the complement system, a strategy of enhancing the complement C3 opsonization of lanthanide&#8208;doped nanoparticles (LnNPs) by modulating their surface chemistry, thus developing a near infrared&#8208;IIb emissive nanotracer for neutrophils, is reported herein. Four kinds of surface&#8208;modified LnNPs are fabricated, among which phospholipids DOPG&#8208;modified LnNPs (LnNPs@PG) with weak antifouling ability and hydroxyl groups adsorb more complement C3 proteins and form covalent linkages with C3b active fragments under inflammation conditions, inducing enhanced complement C3 opsonization. Therefore, LnNPs@PG with enhanced complement C3 opsonization are capable of efficiently labeling inflammation&#8208;stimulated neutrophils in vivo through complement&#8208;receptors&#8208;mediated phagocytosis and achieve dynamic monitoring neutrophils during cutaneous wound healing and cerebral ischemia/reperfusion.

&lt;p&gt;Complement C3 opsonized near-infrared-IIb emissive immunotracers are captured by inflammation-stimulated neutrophils in circulatory blood through complement-receptors-mediated phagocytosis, enabling dynamically monitoring neutrophils during cutaneous wound healing and cerebral ischemia/reperfusion. The strategy of modulating surface chemistry of nanosized imaging agents to enhance complement C3 opsonization provides a new insight to develop immunotracers for in vivo labeling and tracking neutrophils.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real-time monitoring of neutrophil dynamics is crucial for timely diagnosis and effective treatment of inflammation-related diseases, which requires a reliable tracer for in vivo tracking of neutrophils. However, immunotracers for neutrophils are extremely limited because of the difficulty in labeling the cells. Inspired by the natural biological function of the complement system, a strategy of enhancing the complement C3 opsonization of lanthanide-doped nanoparticles (LnNPs) by modulating their surface chemistry, thus developing a near infrared-IIb emissive nanotracer for neutrophils, is reported herein. Four kinds of surface-modified LnNPs are fabricated, among which phospholipids DOPG-modified LnNPs (LnNPs@PG) with weak antifouling ability and hydroxyl groups adsorb more complement C3 proteins and form covalent linkages with C3b active fragments under inflammation conditions, inducing enhanced complement C3 opsonization. Therefore, LnNPs@PG with enhanced complement C3 opsonization are capable of efficiently labeling inflammation-stimulated neutrophils in vivo through complement-receptors-mediated phagocytosis and achieve dynamic monitoring neutrophils during cutaneous wound healing and cerebral ischemia/reperfusion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Phase Exfoliation of Nonlayered Non&#8208;Van&#8208;Der&#8208;Waals Crystals into Nanoplatelets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent research progress on the use of liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation beyond layered van der Waals (vdW) crystals is summarized. Questions remain unanswered on how these 3D strongly bonded nonlayered crystals exfoliate into nanoplatelets, and on the insight of the exfoliation mechanism. The answer to the questions helps in revealing the future direction of this newly grown sub&#8208;family of 2D&#8208;class of materials.








Abstract
For nearly 15 years, researchers have been using liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation (LPE) to produce 2D nanosheets from layered crystals. This has yielded multiple 2D materials in a solution&#8208;processable form whose utility has been demonstrated in multiple applications. It was&#160;believed that the exfoliation of such materials is enabled by the very large bonding anisotropy of layered materials where the strength of intralayer chemical bonds is very much larger than that of interlayer van der Waals bonds. However, over the last five years, a number of papers have raised questions about our&#160;understanding of exfoliation by describing the LPE of nonlayered materials. These results are extremely surprising because, as no van der Waals gap is present to provide an easily cleaved direction, the exfoliation of such compounds requires the breaking of only chemical bonds. Here the progress in this unexpected new research area is examined. The structure and properties of nanoplatelets produced by LPE of nonlayered materials are reviewed. A number of unexplained trends are found, not least the preponderance of isotropic materials that have been exfoliated to give high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio nanoplatelets. Finally, the applications potential of this new class of 2D materials are considered.

         <title>Excimer Formation in the Non&#8208;Van&#8208;Der&#8208;Waals 2D Semiconductor Bi2O2Se</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Excimer formation is unambiguously demonstrated in non&#8208;van der Waals 2D semiconductor Bi2O2Se via transient absorption spectroscopy. The excimer in Bi2O2Se nanosheets is diffusive and its formation can be described as excitons relax to an excimer geometry driven by the ultrafast photoscreening of the intrinsic built&#8208;in dipolar electric field.








Abstract
The layered semiconductor Bi2O2Se is a promising new&#8208;type 2D material that holds layered structure via electrostatic forces instead of van der Waals (vdW) attractions. Aside from the huge success in device performance, the non&#8208;vdW nature in Bi2O2Se with a built&#8208;in interlayer electric field has also provided an appealing platform for investigating unique photoexcited carrier dynamics. Here, experimental evidence for the observation of excimers in multilayer Bi2O2Se nanosheets via transient absorption spectroscopy is presented. It is found that the excimer formation is the primary decay pathway of photoexcited excitons and three&#8208;stage excimer dynamics with corresponding time scales are established. Excitation&#8208;fluence&#8208;dependent excimer dynamics further suggest that the excimer is diffusive and its formation can be simply described as excitons relaxed to an excimer geometry. This work indicates the outstanding promise of unique excitonic processes in Bi2O2Se, which may motivate novel device designs.

         <title>Asymmetric Co&#63743;N3P1 Trifunctional Catalyst with Tailored Electronic Structures Enabling Boosted Activities and Corrosion Resistance in an Uninterrupted Seawater Splitting System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric Co&#63743;N3P1 with a harmonized electronic structure can achieve strong O&#8208;binding ability, moderate H adsorption, and weak Cl&#8722;&#8208;binding ability, which helps to repel Cl&#8722; anions for enhanced corrosion resistance and optimization of the trifunctional ORR/OER/HER performance simultaneously, displaying promising potential for application in an uninterrupted seawater splitting system.








Abstract
Employing seawater splitting systems to generate hydrogen can be economically advantageous but still remains challenging, particularly for designing efficient and high Cl&#8722;&#8208;corrosion resistant trifunctional catalysts toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, single Co&#63743;N&#63743;C catalysts with well&#8208;defined symmetric Co&#63743;N4 sites are selected as atomic platforms for electronic structure tailoring. Density function theory reveals that P&#8208;doping into Co&#63743;N&#63743;C can lead to the formation of asymmetric Co&#63743;N3P1 sites with symmetry&#8208;breaking electronic structures, enabling the affinity of strong oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates, moderate H adsorption, and weak Cl&#8722; adsorption. Thus, ORR/OER/HER activities and stability are optimized simultaneously with high Cl&#8722;&#8208;corrosion resistance. The asymmetric Co&#63743;N3P1 structure based catalyst with boosted ORR/OER/HER performance endows seawater&#8208;based Zn&#8211;air batteries (S&#8208;ZABs) with superior long&#8208;term stability over 750 h and allows seawater splitting to operate continuously for 1000 h. A self&#8208;driven seawater splitting powered by S&#8208;ZABs gives ultrahigh H2 production rates of 497&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1. This work is the first to advance the scientific understanding of the competitive adsorption mechanism between Cl&#8722; and reaction intermediates from the perspective of electronic structure, paving the way for synthesis of efficient trifunctional catalysts with high Cl&#8722;&#8208;corrosion resistance.

         <title>Osteoimmunity&#8208;Regulating Biomimetically Hierarchical Scaffold for Augmented Bone Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 3D printed scaffold with biomimetically hierarchical porous structure is constructed for augmented bone regeneration through the enhanced immunomodulatory, angiogenic, osteogenic, and weak osteoclastogenic abilities. Such osteoimmunity&#8208;regulating scaffold upregulates M2 macrophages by released carbon monoxide and&#160;Mn2+, enhances neovascularization through secreted vascular endothelial growth factor, and effectively stimulates osteoinductive activity while inhibiting osteoclast differentiation, offering positive enlightenment for promoting large&#8208;scale bone defect repair.








Abstract
Engineering a proper immune response following biomaterial implantation is essential to bone tissue regeneration. Herein, a biomimetically hierarchical scaffold composed of deferoxamine@poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone) nanoparticles (DFO@PCL NPs), manganese carbonyl (MnCO) nanosheets, gelatin methacryloyl hydrogel, and a polylactide/hydroxyapatite (HA) matrix is fabricated to augment bone repair by facilitating the balance of the immune system and bone metabolism. First, a 3D printed stiff scaffold with a well&#8208;organized gradient structure mimics the cortical and cancellous bone tissues; meanwhile, an inside infusion of a soft hydrogel further endows the scaffold with characteristics of the extracellular matrix. A Fenton&#8208;like reaction between MnCO and endogenous hydrogen peroxide generated at the implant&#8208;tissue site triggers continuous release of carbon monoxide and Mn2+, thus significantly lessening inflammatory response by upregulating the M2 phenotype of macrophages, which also secretes vascular endothelial growth factor to induce vascular formation. Through activating the hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor&#8208;1&#945; pathway, Mn2+ and DFO@PCL NP further promote angiogenesis. Moreover, DFO inhibits osteoclast differentiation and synergistically collaborates with the osteoinductive activity of HA. Based on amounts of data in vitro and in vivo, strong immunomodulatory, intensive angiogenic, weak osteoclastogenic, and superior osteogenic abilities of such an osteoimmunity&#8208;regulating scaffold present a profound effect on improving bone regeneration, which puts forward a worthy base and positive enlightenment for large&#8208;scale bone defect repair.

         <title>Unraveling the Correlation between Raman and Photoluminescence in Monolayer MoS2 through Machine&#8208;Learning Models</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A collection of machine&#8208;learning techniques is utilized to effectively discover the hidden pattern between Raman&#8208; and PL&#8208;spectra of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), which provide insights into the physical mechanisms connecting PL and Raman features. This study's analysis further disentangles the strain and doping contributions from the Raman spectra through machine&#8208;learning models.








Abstract
2D&#160;transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) with intense and tunable photoluminescence (PL) have opened up new opportunities for optoelectronic and photonic applications such as light&#8208;emitting diodes, photodetectors, and single&#8208;photon emitters. Among the standard characterization tools for 2D materials, Raman spectroscopy stands out as a fast and non&#8208;destructive technique capable of probing material's&#160;crystallinity and perturbations such as doping and strain. However, a comprehensive understanding of the correlation between photoluminescence and Raman spectra in monolayer&#160;MoS2 remains elusive due to its highly nonlinear nature. Here, the connections between PL signatures and Raman modes are systematically explored, providing comprehensive insights into the physical mechanisms correlating PL and Raman features. This study's analysis further disentangles the strain and doping contributions from the Raman spectra through machine&#8208;learning models. First, a dense convolutional network (DenseNet)&#160;to predict PL maps by spatial Raman maps is deployed. Moreover, a gradient boosted trees model (XGBoost) with Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) to bridge the impact of individual Raman features in PL features is applied. Last, a support vector machine (SVM) to project PL features on Raman frequencies is adopted. This work may serve as a methodology for applying machine learning to characterizations of 2D materials.

         <title>Directed Evolution Enables Simultaneous Controlled Release of Multiple Therapeutic Proteins from Biopolymer&#8208;Based Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Directed evolution enables the identification of distinct binding partners to multiple therapeutically&#8208;relevant proteins, thereby enabling their bioactive, independently&#8208;tunable, and simultaneous controlled release from hydrogel delivery vehicles.








Abstract
With the advent of increasingly complex combination strategies of biologics, independent control over their delivery is the key to their efficacy; however, current approaches are hindered by the limited independent tunability of their release rates. To overcome these limitations, directed evolution is used to engineer highly specific, low affinity affibody binding partners to multiple therapeutic proteins to independently control protein release rates. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, specific affibody binding partners for two proteins with broad therapeutic utility: insulin&#8208;like growth factor&#8208;1 (IGF&#8208;1) and pigment epithelium&#8208;derived factor (PEDF) are identified. Protein&#8211;affibody binding interactions specific to these target proteins with equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) between 10&#8722;7 and 10&#8722;8 m are discovered. The affibodies are covalently bound to the backbone of crosslinked hydrogels using click chemistry, enabling sustained, independent, and simultaneous release of bioactive IGF&#8208;1 and PEDF over 7 days. The system is tested with C57BL/6J mice in vivo, and the affibody&#8208;controlled release of IGF&#8208;1 results in sustained activity when compared to bolus IGF&#8208;1 delivery. This work demonstrates a new, broadly applicable approach to tune the release of therapeutic proteins simultaneously and independently and thus the way for precise control over the delivery of multicomponent therapies is paved.

         <title>Herpesvirus&#8208;Mimicking DNAzyme&#8208;Loaded Nanoparticles As a Mitochondrial DNA Stress Inducer to Activate Innate Immunity for Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Virus&#8208;based immunotherapy is a promising approach to treat tumor. Closely mimicking the structure and sequential infection processes of natural viruses is highly desirable for effective tumor immunotherapy but remains challenging. Here, inspired by the robust innate immunity induced by herpesvirus, we engineered a herpesvirus&#8208;mimicking nanoparticle (named Vir&#8208;ZM@TD) for tumor therapy by mimicking the structure and infection processes of herpesvirus. In this biomimetic system, DNAzyme&#8208;loaded manganese&#8209;doped zeolitic imidazolate frameworks&#8209;90 nanoparticles (ZM@TD) mimic the virus nucleocapsid containing the genome; erythrocyte membrane mimics the viral envelope; and two functional peptides, RGD and HA2 peptides, resemble the surface glycoprotein spikes of herpesvirus. Vir&#8208;ZM@TD can both effectively evade rapid clearance in the blood circulation and closely mimic the serial infection processes of herpesvirus, including specific tumor targeting, membrane fusion&#8208;mediated endosomal escape, and TFAM (transcription factor A, mitochondrial) deficiency&#8208;triggered mitochondrial DNA stress, as well as the release of manganese ions (Mn2+) from organelles into the cytosol, ultimately effectively priming cGAS&#8208;STING pathway&#8208;mediated innate immunity with 68% complete regression of primary tumors and extending by 32 days the median survival time of 4T1 tumor&#8208;bearing mice.

         <title>Percolated Plasmonic Superlattices of Nanospheres with 1&#8208;nm&#8208;level Gap as High&#8208;Index Metamaterials</title>

Abstract
Nanophotonics relies on precise control of refractive index which can be designed with metamaterials. Plasmonic superstructures of nanoparticles (NPs) can suggest a versatile way of tuning refractive index. However, the plasmonic effects in the superstructures demand 1&#8208;nm&#8208;level exquisite control over the inter&#8208;particle gap which is challenging in a sub&#8208;wavelength NPs. Thus far, a large area demonstration has been mostly discouraged. Here, we prepared hetero&#8208;ligand AuNPs which are stable in oil but become Janus particles at the oil&#8208;water interface, called &#8220;adaptive Janus particles&#8221;. NPs are bound at the interface and assembled into 2D arrays over square centimeters as toluene evaporates, which distinctively exhibit the refractive index tunability. In visible and NIR, our 2D superstructures exhibited the highest&#8208;ever refractive index (&#8764;7.8) with varying the size and inter&#8208;particle gap of NPs, which was successfully explained by plasmonic percolation model. Furthermore, fully solution&#8208;processable 2D plasmonic superstructures proved to be advantageous in flexible photonic devices such as distributed Bragg reflectors.

Abstract
The addition of small seeding particles into a supersaturated solution is one among the most effective approaches to obtain high&#8208;quality semiconductor materials via increased crystallization rates. However, limited study was conducted on this approach for the fabrication of perovskite solar cells. Here, we propose a new strategy &#8211; &#8220;heterogeneous seeding&#8208;induced crystallization (hetero&#8208;SiC)&#8221; to assist the growth of FAPbI3&#8208;based perovskite. In this work, the (t&#8208;Bu)2PMeHBF4 is directly introduced into the precursor which forms a low solubility complex with PbI2. The low solubility complex can serve as the seed to induce crystallization of perovskite during the solvent evaporation process. Various in situ measurement tools are used to visualize the hetero&#8208;SiC process, which has been shown to be an effective way of manipulating the nucleation and crystal growth of perovskite. The hetero&#8208;SiC greatly improves the film quality, reduces the film defects, and suppresses the non&#8208;radiative recombination. The hetero&#8208;SIC proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept device exhibits outstanding performance with 24.0% PCE, well over the control device with 22.2% PCE. Additionally, hetero&#8208;SiC PSC stability under light illumination is enhanced and retains 84 percent of its initial performance after 1400 hours of light illumination.

         <title>Peptide&#8208;Based Coacervate&#8208;Core Vesicles with Semipermeable Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coacervate droplets are promising protocell candidates. However, these droplets lack a membrane and are prone to coalescence, limiting their survival and ability to interact. This work shows that short tyrosine&#8208;rich peptide conjugates can undergo liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation and subsequently transform into stable membrane&#8208;enclosed protocells by enzymatic oxidation. The coacervate&#8208;core vesicles are semipermeable and can host enzymatic reactions.








Abstract
Coacervates droplets have long been considered as potential protocells to mimic living cells. However, these droplets lack a membrane and are prone to coalescence, limiting their ability to survive, interact, and organize into higher&#8208;order assemblies. This work shows that tyrosine&#8208;rich peptide conjugates can undergo liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation in a well&#8208;defined pH window and transform into stable membrane&#8208;enclosed protocells by enzymatic oxidation and cross&#8208;linking at the liquid&#8211;liquid interface. The oxidation of the tyrosine&#8208;rich peptides into dityrosine creates a semipermeable, flexible membrane around the coacervates with tunable thickness, which displays strong intrinsic fluorescence, and stabilizes the coacervate protocells against coalescence. The membranes have an effective molecular weight cut&#8208;off of 2.5&#160;kDa, as determined from the partitioning of small dyes and labeled peptides, RNA, and polymers into the membrane&#8208;enclosed coacervate protocells. Flicker spectroscopy reveals a membrane bending rigidity of only 0.1kBT, which is substantially lower than phospholipid bilayers despite a larger membrane thickness. Finally, it is shown that enzymes can be stably encapsulated inside the protocells and be supplied with substrates from outside, which opens the way for these membrane&#8208;bound compartments to be used as molecularly crowded artificial cells capable of communication or as a vehicle for drug delivery.

         <title>Tunable Strong Coupling in Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Nanowires</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemically synthesized transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) nanowires are exploited as a new type of subwavelength optical nanoresonators to simultaneously support pronounced excitonic and Mie resonances. Strong coupling between excitons and Mie resonances is demonstrated to support Mie&#8208;exciton polaritons. Moreover, the optical coupling can be further tuned by optothermal effects in a reversible and reproducible way.








Abstract
Subwavelength optical resonators with spatiotemporal control of light are essential to the miniaturization of optical devices. In this work, chemically synthesized transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) nanowires are exploited as a new type of dielectric nanoresonators to simultaneously support pronounced excitonic and Mie resonances. Strong light&#8211;matter couplings and tunable exciton polaritons in individual nanowires are demonstrated. In addition, the excitonic responses can be reversibly modulated with excellent reproducibility, offering the potential for developing tunable optical nanodevices. Being in the mobile colloidal state with highly tunable optical properties, the TMDC nanoresonators will find promising applications in integrated active optical devices, including all&#8208;optical switches and sensors.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Magnon&#8208;Mediated Magnetization Switching in All&#8208;Oxide Heterostructures with Perpendicular Magnetic Anisotropy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The magnon current excited in an insulating antiferromagnetic layer by an electronic spin current in an epitaxial all&#8208;oxide heterostructure is demonstrated to be effective for manipulating the perpendicular magnetization in a ferromagnetic layer. Furthermore, the critical current density to switch the magnetization is about one order of magnitude smaller than in conventional metallic systems.








Abstract
The search for efficient approaches to realize local switching of magnetic moments in spintronic devices has attracted extensive attention. One of the most promising approaches is the electrical manipulation of magnetization through electron&#8208;mediated spin torque. However, the Joule heat generated via electron motion unavoidably causes substantial energy dissipation and potential damage to spintronic devices. Here, all&#8208;oxide heterostructures of SrRuO3/NiO/SrIrO3 are epitaxially grown on SrTiO3 single&#8208;crystal substrates following the order of the ferromagnetic transition metal oxide SrRuO3 with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, insulating and antiferromagnetic NiO, and metallic transition metal oxide SrIrO3 with strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling. It is demonstrated that instead of the electron spin torques, the magnon torques present in the antiferromagnetic NiO layer can directly manipulate the perpendicular magnetization of the ferromagnetic layer. This magnon mechanism may significantly reduce the electron motion&#8208;related energy dissipation from electron&#8208;mediated spin currents. Interestingly, the threshold current density to generate a sufficient magnon current to manipulate the magnetization is one order of magnitude smaller than that in conventional metallic systems. These findings suggest a route for developing highly efficient all&#8208;oxide spintronic devices operated by magnon current.

         <title>All&#8208;Printed Ultrahigh&#8208;Responsivity MoS2 Nanosheet Photodetectors Enabled by Megasonic Exfoliation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fully aerosol&#8208;jet printed (AJP) photodetectors are fabricated using megasonically exfoliated MoS2 channels and graphene electrodes. Superlative optoelectronic performance is attributed to the megasonically thinned MoS2 nanosheets, resulting in responsivities that exceed previous all&#8208;printed visible photodetectors by over three orders of magnitude.








Abstract
Printed 2D&#160;materials, derived from solution&#8208;processed inks, offer scalable and cost&#8208;effective routes to mechanically flexible optoelectronics. With micrometer&#8208;scale control and broad processing latitude, aerosol&#8208;jet printing (AJP) is of particular interest for all&#8208;printed circuits and systems. Here, AJP is utilized to achieve ultrahigh&#8208;responsivity photodetectors consisting of well&#8208;aligned, percolating networks of semiconducting MoS2 nanosheets and graphene electrodes on flexible polyimide substrates. Ultrathin (&#8776;1.2&#160;nm thick) and high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio (&#8776;1&#160;&#181;m lateral size) MoS2 nanosheets are obtained by electrochemical intercalation followed by megasonic atomization during AJP, which not only aerosolizes the inks but also further exfoliates the nanosheets. The incorporation of the high&#8208;boiling&#8208;point solvent terpineol into the MoS2 ink is critical for achieving a highly aligned and flat thin&#8208;film morphology following AJP as confirmed by grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering and atomic force microscopy. Following AJP, curing is achieved with photonic annealing, which yields quasi&#8208;ohmic contacts and photoactive channels with responsivities exceeding 103&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1 that outperform previously reported all&#8208;printed visible&#8208;light photodetectors by over three orders of magnitude. Megasonic exfoliation coupled with properly designed AJP ink formulations enables the superlative optoelectronic properties of ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets to be preserved and exploited for the scalable additive manufacturing of mechanically flexible optoelectronics.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Printed 2D&#160;materials, derived from solution-processed inks, offer scalable and cost-effective routes to mechanically flexible optoelectronics. With micrometer-scale control and broad processing latitude, aerosol-jet printing (AJP) is of particular interest for all-printed circuits and systems. Here, AJP is utilized to achieve ultrahigh-responsivity photodetectors consisting of well-aligned, percolating networks of semiconducting MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets and graphene electrodes on flexible polyimide substrates. Ultrathin (&#8776;1.2&#160;nm thick) and high-aspect-ratio (&#8776;1&#160;&#181;m lateral size) MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets are obtained by electrochemical intercalation followed by megasonic atomization during AJP, which not only aerosolizes the inks but also further exfoliates the nanosheets. The incorporation of the high-boiling-point solvent terpineol into the MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ink is critical for achieving a highly aligned and flat thin-film morphology following AJP as confirmed by grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering and atomic force microscopy. Following AJP, curing is achieved with photonic annealing, which yields quasi-ohmic contacts and photoactive channels with responsivities exceeding 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;A&#160;W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; that outperform previously reported all-printed visible-light photodetectors by over three orders of magnitude. Megasonic exfoliation coupled with properly designed AJP ink formulations enables the superlative optoelectronic properties of ultrathin MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets to be preserved and exploited for the scalable additive manufacturing of mechanically flexible optoelectronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Poly(arylene piperidine) Quaternary Ammonium Salts Promoting Stable Long&#8208;Lived Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence in Aqueous Environment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A long&#8208;lived polymeric room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP)&#160;system is developed based on the electrostatic interaction acting between a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) matrix and a polymer phosphor. The quaternization of the polymeric phosphors significantly enhances the RTP performance, and a&#160;bright&#8208;green phosphorescence with a lifetime of 960&#160;ms can be observed even after soaking in water&#160;for a month.








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials have garnered considerable research attention owing to their excellent luminescence properties and potential application prospects in anti&#8208;counterfeiting, information storage, and optoelectronics. However, several RTP systems are extremely sensitive to humidity, and consequently, the realization of long&#8208;lived RTP in water remains a formidable challenge. Herein, a feasible and effective strategy is presented to achieve long&#8208;lived polymeric RTP systems, even in an aqueous environment, through doping of synthesized polymeric phosphor PBHDB into a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) matrix. Compared to the precursor polymer PBN and organic molecule HDBP, a more rigid polymer microenvironment and electrostatic interaction are formed between the PMMA matrix and polymer PBHDB, which effectively reduce&#160;the nonradiative decay rate of triplet excitons and dramatically increase&#160;the phosphorescence intensity. Specifically, the phosphorescence lifetime of the PBHDB@PMMA film (1258.62&#160;ms) is much longer than those of PBN@PMMA (674.20&#160;ms) and HDBP@PMMA (1.06&#160;ms). Most importantly, a bright&#8208;green afterglow can be observed after soaking the PBHDB@PMMA film in water for more than a month. The excellent water resistance and reversible response properties endow these systems with promising potential for dynamic information encryption even in water.

         <title>Tackling Disorder in &#947;&#8208;Ga2O3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Ga2O3 and its polymorphs are attracting increasing attention. The rich structural space of polymorphic oxide systems such as Ga2O3 offers potential for electronic structure engineering, which is of particular interest for a range of applications, such as power electronics. &#947;&#8208;Ga2O3 presents a particular challenge across synthesis, characterisation, and theory due to its inherent disorder and resulting complex structure &#8211; electronic structure relationship. Here, density functional theory is used in combination with a machine learning approach to screen nearly one million potential structures, thereby developing a robust atomistic model of the &#947;&#8208;phase. Theoretical results are compared with surface and bulk sensitive soft and hard X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, spectroscopic ellipsometry, and photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy experiments representative of the occupied and unoccupied states of &#947;&#8208;Ga2O3. The first onset of strong absorption at room temperature is found at 5.1&#160;eV from spectroscopic ellipsometry, which agrees well with the excitation maximum at 5.17&#160;eV obtained by PLE spectroscopy, where the latter shifts to 5.33&#160;eV at 5&#160;K. This work presents a leap forward in the treatment of complex, disordered oxides and is a crucial step towards exploring how their electronic structure can be understood in terms of local coordination and overall structure.

         <title>Halide Remixing Under Device Operation Imparts Stability on Mixed&#8208;Cation Mixed&#8208;Halide Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Mixed&#8208;halide mixed&#8208;cation hybrid perovskites are among the most promising perovskite compositions for application in a variety of optoelectronic devices due to their high performance, low cost, and bandgap tuning capabilities. Instability pathways such as those driven by ionic migration however continue to hinder their further progress. Here, we&#160;use an operando variable&#8208;pitch synchrotron Grazing&#8208;Incidence Wide&#8208;Angle X&#8208;ray Scattering technique to track the surface and bulk structural changes in mixed&#8208;halide mixed&#8208;cation perovskite solar cells under continuous load and illumination. By monitoring the evolution of the material structure, we&#160;demonstrate that halide remixing along the electric field and illumination direction during operation hinders phase segregation and limits device instability. Correlating the evolution with directionality&#8208; and depth&#8208;dependent analyses, we&#160;propose that this halide remixing is induced by an electrostrictive effect acting along the substrate out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction. However, this stabilizing effect is overwhelmed by competing halide demixing processes in devices exposed to humid air or with poorer starting performance. Our&#160;findings shed new light on understanding halide de&#8208; and re&#8208;mixing competitions and their impact on device longevity. These operando techniques allow real&#8208;time tracking of the structural evolution in full optoelectronic devices and unveil otherwise inaccessible insights into rapid structural evolution under external stress&#160;conditions.

         <title>Unlocking Interfacial Electron Transfer of Ruthenium Phosphides by Homologous Core&#8208;Shell Design toward Efficient Hydrogen Evolution and Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Developing high efficiency electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution and oxidation reactions (HER/HOR) in alkaline electrolytes is of critical importance for realizing renewable hydrogen technologies. Ruthenium phosphides (RuPx) are promising candidates to substitute Pt&#8208;based electrodes, however, great challenges still remain in their electronic structure regulation for optimizing intermediate adsorption. Herein, we report that homologous RuP@RuP2 core&#8208;shell architecture constructed by a phosphatization&#8208;controlled phase transformation strategy enables strong electron coupling for optimal intermediate adsorption by virtue of the emergent interfacial functionality. Density functional theory calculations show that the RuP core and RuP2 shell present efficient electron transfer, leading to a close to thermoneutral hydrogen adsorption Gibbs free energy of 0.04&#160;eV. Impressively, the resulting material exhibits superior HER/HOR activities in alkaline media, which outperform the benchmark Pt/C and are among the best reported bifunctional hydrogen electrocatalysts. The present work not only provides an efficient and cost&#8208;effective bifunctional hydrogen electrocatalyst, but also offers a new synthetic protocol to rationally synthesize homologous core&#8208;shell nanostructures for widespread applications.

         <title>An initial covalent&#8208;organic polymer with closed&#8208;F edges directly for proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Covalent organic polymers (COPs) are a class of rising electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) due to the atomically metrical control of the organic molecular components along with highly architectural robustness and thermodynamic stability even in acid or alkaline media. However, the direct application of pristine COPs as acidic ORR electrocatalysts, especially in device manner, e.g. proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), remains a big challenge. Currently, the decoration towards electronic structures of active sites is considered a vital pathway to enhancing the acidic ORR activity of carbon&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Here, we reported an initial F&#8208;decorated full closed &#960;&#8208;conjugated quasi&#8208;phthalocyanine COP (denoted as COPBTC&#8208;F). The introduction of the closed&#8208;F edges stepwise drags more electrons from FeN4 sites in COPBTC&#8208;F into the catalyst margin, which weakens occupied numbers of bonding orbitals between COPBTC&#8208;F and OH* intermediates at the rate&#8208;determining step (RDS), exhibiting over five times intrinsic performance beyond the counterpart without F functionalities (termed as COPBTC). Significantly, the maximum power density utilizing COPBTC&#8208;F as cathode catalyst in PEMFCs is remarkably increased by an order of magnitude compared with COPBTC, which is a stride forward among pristine conjugated&#8208;polymer&#8208;network&#8208;based catalysts in device manner to date.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covalent organic polymers (COPs) are a class of rising electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) due to the atomically metrical control of the organic molecular components along with highly architectural robustness and thermodynamic stability even in acid or alkaline media. However, the direct application of pristine COPs as acidic ORR electrocatalysts, especially in device manner, e.g. proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), remains a big challenge. Currently, the decoration towards electronic structures of active sites is considered a vital pathway to enhancing the acidic ORR activity of carbon-based electrocatalysts. Here, we reported an initial F-decorated full closed &lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;-conjugated quasi-phthalocyanine COP (denoted as COP&lt;sub&gt;BTC&lt;/sub&gt;-F). The introduction of the closed-F edges stepwise drags more electrons from FeN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; sites in COP&lt;sub&gt;BTC&lt;/sub&gt;-F into the catalyst margin, which weakens occupied numbers of bonding orbitals between COP&lt;sub&gt;BTC&lt;/sub&gt;-F and OH* intermediates at the rate-determining step (RDS), exhibiting over five times intrinsic performance beyond the counterpart without F functionalities (termed as COP&lt;sub&gt;BTC&lt;/sub&gt;). Significantly, the maximum power density utilizing COP&lt;sub&gt;BTC&lt;/sub&gt;-F as cathode catalyst in PEMFCs is remarkably increased by an order of magnitude compared with COP&lt;sub&gt;BTC&lt;/sub&gt;, which is a stride forward among pristine conjugated-polymer-network-based catalysts in device manner to date.&lt;/p&gt;

An ultrastable and kinetically favorable interface is constructed between sulfide&#8211;poly(ethylene oxide) composite solid electrolytes and lithium metal, via in&#160;situ formation of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) containing Li3PS4. This simple and effective approach of constructing a highly&#160;Li+&#8208;conductive, electronically insulating, chemically/electrochemically stable, and mechanically compatible Li3PS4/Li2S/LiF SEI can lead to small interfacial resistance and uniform lithium plating, which makes Li&#8208;metal&#8208;anode all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries possible.








Abstract
An ultrastable and kinetically favorable interface is constructed between sulfide&#8211;poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) composite solid electrolytes (CSEs) and lithium metal, via in&#160;situ formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer containing Li3PS4. A specially&#160;designed sulfide, lithium polysulfidophosphate (LPS), can distribute uniformly in the PEO matrix via a simple stirring process because of its complete solubility in acetonitrile solvent, which is advantageous for creating a homogeneous SEI layer. The CSE/Li interface with high Li+ transportation capability is stabilized quickly through in&#160;situ formation of a Li3PS4/Li2S/LiF layer via the reaction between LPS and lithium metal to inhibit lithium dendrite growth. A Li/Li symmetric cell with the LPS&#8208;integrated CSE exhibits constant and small CSE/Li resistance of 10&#160;&#937;&#160;cm2&#160;during cycling, delivering stable cycling for 3475&#160;h at a current density of 0.2&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;and a high critical current density of 0.9&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;at 60&#160;&#176;C. Impressive electrochemical performance is also demonstrated for LiFePO4/CSE/Li all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries with capacity of 127.6&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;after 1000&#160;cycles at 1&#160;C.

         <title>The Promise of Soft Matter Enabled Quantum Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The field of quantum materials has experienced rapid growth over the past decade, driven by exciting new discoveries with immense transformative potential. Traditional synthetic methods to quantum materials have, however, limited the exploration of architectural control beyond the atomic scale. In contrast, soft matter self&#8208;assembly can be used to tailor materials structure over a large range of length scales, with a vast array of possible form factors, promising emerging quantum materials properties at the mesoscale. This review explores opportunities for soft matter science to impact the synthesis of quantum materials with advanced properties. Existing work at the interface of these two fields is highlighted, and perspectives are provided on possible future directions by discussing the potential benefits and challenges which could arise from their bridging.

         <title>Self&#8208;Reporting Fluorescent Salicylaldehyde&#8208;Chlorambucil Conjugate As A Type II ICD Inducer for Cancer Vaccine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Immunogenic cell death (ICD) can activate the anticancer immune response and is highly attractive to improve cancer treatment efficacy. ICD is closely related with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and a series of ICD inducers were recently reported based on ER&#8208;targeted photodynamic/photothermal agents or metal complexes. However, these ER&#8208;targeted ICD inducers suffer from complicated synthesis and heavy metal cytotoxicity. Inspired by the promising clinical potential of small organic molecules, herein, we develop an ER&#8208;targeted fluorescent self&#8208;reporting ICD inducer SA&#8208;Cbl by simple conjugation of chemotherapeutic drug chlorambucil (Cbl) with salicylaldehyde (SA). SA&#8208;Cbl can selectively accumulate in ER to induce rapid ROS generation and unfolded protein response process, which led to a fast release of damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and efficient dendritic cells maturation. Meanwhile, the ER&#8208;targeted accumulation and ER&#8208;stress inducing process can be in situ monitored based on the turn&#8208;on fluorescence of SA&#8208;Cbl, which is highly pH and polarity&#8208;sensitive and can selectively interact with ER proteins. Compared with traditional chemotherapy drug doxorubicin, the superior anticancer immunity effect of SA&#8208;Cbl was verified via an in vivo tumor model. This study thus provides a new strategy for developing fluorescent self&#8208;reporting ICD inducers by decoration of chemotherapeutic drugs with pH and polarity sensitive organic fluorophores.

         <title>Polarized Cu&#8208;Bi Site Pairs for Non&#8208;Covalent to Covalent Interaction Tuning towards N2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
A universal atomic layer confined doping strategy is developed to prepare isolated Cu atoms incorporated Bi24O31Br10 materials. The local polarization can be created along Cu&#8208;O&#8208;Bi atomic interface, which enables better electron delocalization for effective N2 activation. The optimized Cu&#8208;Bi24O31Br10 atomic layers show 5.3 and 88.2 times improved photocatalytic nitrogen fixation activity than Bi24O31Br10 atomic layer and bulk Bi24O31Br10, respectively, with the NH3 generation rate arrive 291.1&#160;&#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in pure water. The polarized Cu&#8208;Bi site pairs can increase the non&#8208;covalent interaction between catalyst's surface and N2 molecule, then further weaken the covalent bond order in N&#8208;N. As a result, the hydrogenation pathways can be altered from associative distal pathway for Bi24O31Br10 to the alternating pathway for Cu&#8208;Bi24O31Br10. This strategy provides an accessible pathway for designing polarized metal site pairs or tune the non&#8208;covalent interaction and covalent bond order.

A highly reversible and dendrite&#8208;free Zn&#8208;metal anode is achieved by the surface transformation of Cu substrate in a nonaqueous electrolyte. Meanwhile, the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer growth mechanism and edge&#8208;to&#8208;center stripping behavior during the plating and stripping processes is revealed by in situ electrochemical atomic force microscopy (EC&#8208;AFM).








Abstract
Significant challenges remain in developing rechargeable zinc batteries mainly because of reversibility problems on zinc&#8208;metal anodes. The dendritic growth and hydrogen evolution on zinc electrodes are major obstacles to overcome in developing practical and safe zinc batteries. Here, a dendrite&#8208;free and hydrogen&#8208;free Zn&#8208;metal anode with high Coulombic efficiency up to 99.6% over 300 cycles is realized in a newly designed nonaqueous electrolyte, which comprises an inexpensive zinc salt, zinc acetate, and a green low&#8208;cost solvent, dimethyl sulfoxide. Surface transformation on Cu substrate plays a critical role in facilitating the dendrite&#8208;free deposition process, which lowers the diffusion energy barrier of the Zn atoms, leading to a uniform and compact thin film for zinc plating. Furthermore, in situ electrochemical atomic force microscopy reveals the plating process via a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer growth mechanism and the stripping process through an edge&#8208;dissolution mechanism. In addition, Zn||Mo6S8 full cells exhibit excellent electrochemical performance in terms of cycling stability and rate capability. This work presents a new opportunity to develop nonaqueous rechargeable zinc batteries.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Inspired Microenvironment Engineering of a Single&#8208;Molecular Heterojunction for Promoting Concerted Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzyme&#8208;inspired single&#8208;molecular heterojunction electrocatalyst with accurate amino&#8208;rich microenvironments around the active sites is uniquely designed to enable efficient CO2 capture and fast proton ferrying during CO2 electroreduction, which achieves concurrent CO production at the cathode and sulfur recovery at the anode with industrial&#8208;level current density and lower energy consumption.








Abstract
Challenges remain in the development of novel multifunctional electrocatalysts and their industrial operation on low&#8208;electricity pair&#8208;electrocatalysis platforms for the carbon cycle. Herein, an enzyme&#8208;inspired single&#8208;molecular heterojunction electrocatalyst ((NHx)16&#8208;NiPc/CNTs) with specific atomic nickel centers and amino&#8208;rich local microenvironments for industrial&#8208;level electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) and further energy&#8208;saving integrated CO2 electrolysis is designed and developed. (NHx)16&#8208;NiPc/CNTs exhibit unprecedented catalytic performance with industry&#8208;compatible current densities, &#8776;100% Faradaic efficiency and remarkable stability for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion, outperforming most reported catalysts. In addition to the enhanced CO2 capture by chemisorption, the sturdy deuterium kinetic isotope effect and proton inventory studies sufficiently reveal&#160;that such distinctive local microenvironments provide an effective proton ferry effect for improving local alkalinity and proton transfer and creating local interactions to stabilize the intermediate, ultimately enabling the high&#8208;efficiency operation of eCO2RR. Further, by using (NHx)16&#8208;NiPc/CNTs as a bifunctional electrocatalyst in a flow cell, a low&#8208;electricity overall CO2 electrolysis system coupling cathodic eCO2RR with anodic oxidation reaction is developed to achieve concurrent feed gas production and sulfur recovery, simultaneously decreasing the energy input. This work paves the new way in exploring molecular electrocatalysts and electrolysis systems with techno&#8208;economic feasibility.

         <title>Tactile Near&#8208;Sensor Analogue Computing for Ultrafast Responsive Artificial Skin</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tactile near&#8208;sensor analogue computing system that integrates a pyramidal pressure sensor array and a flexible memristor array is reported. The system can simultaneously sense and process multiple tactile stimuli without any conversion circuits. Such integration approach enables energy&#8208;efficient near&#8208;sensor analogue computing for ultrafast artificial skin applications.








Abstract
Ultrafast artificial skin enables unprecedented tactile internet applications in prosthetics, robotics, and human&#8211;machine interactions. However, current artificial skin systems that rely on front&#8208;end interface electronics typically perform redundant data transfer and analogue&#8208;to&#8208;digital conversions for decision&#8208;making, causing long latency (milliseconds). Here, a near&#8208;sensor analogue computing system based on a flexible memristor array for artificial skin applications is reported. This system, which seamlessly integrates a tactile sensor array with a flexible hafnium oxide memristor array, can simultaneously sense and compute raw multiple analogue pressure signals without interface electronics. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the system is used for real&#8208;time noise reduction and edge detection of tactile stimuli. One sensing&#8211;computing operation of this system takes about 400&#160;ns and consumes on average 1000 times less power than a conventional interface electronic system. The results demonstrate that near&#8208;sensor analogue computing offers an ultrafast and energy&#8208;efficient route to large&#8208;scale artificial skin systems.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Responsive Magnetoactive and Electro&#8211;Ionic Soft Actuator Derived from a Nickel&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A magnetically and electrically driven dual&#8208;responsive soft actuator is presented by an engineering of unprecedented nickel&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (Ni&#8208;MOF). It can nurture the complex motion for relevant robotic interaction. The magneto&#8211;electro&#8208;ionic soft actuator obtained from the newly developed Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;derived active material is successfully utilized to demonstrate hovering motion of a hummingbird robot under magnetic and electrical stimuli.








Abstract
There is growing demand for multiresponsive soft actuators for the realization of natural, safe, and complex motions in robotic interactions. In particular, soft actuators simultaneously stimulated by electrical and magnetic fields are always under development owing to their simple controllability and reliability during operation. Herein, magnetically and electrically driven dual&#8208;responsive soft actuators (MESAs) derived from novel nickel&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Ni&#8208;MOFs&#8208;700C), are reported. Nanoscale Ni&#8208;MOFs&#8208;700C has excellent electrochemical and magnetic properties that allow it to be used as a multifunctional material under both magnetoactive and electro&#8208;ionic actuations. The dual&#8208;responsive MESA exhibits a bending displacement of 30&#160;mm and an ultrafast rising time of 1.5 s under a very low input voltage of 1&#160;V and also exerts a bending deflection of 12.5&#160;mm at 50 mT under a high excitation frequency of 5&#160;Hz. By utilizing a dual&#8208;responsive MESA, the hovering motion of a hummingbird robot is demonstrated under magnetic and electrical stimuli.

         <title>The Energy Level Conundrum of Organic Semiconductors in Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photovoltaic gap measured by ultraviolet and low&#8208;energy photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS/LE&#8208;IPES) gives the best correlation to device properties, enabling the prediction of maximum Voc. Cyclic voltammetry (CV)&#8208;derived redox potentials are less meaningful for predicting the energetic landscape at the &#8220;donor&#8221;&#8211;&#8220;acceptor&#8221; interface.








Abstract
The frontier molecular energy levels of organic semiconductors are decisive for their fundamental function and efficiency in optoelectronics. However, the precise determination of these energy levels and their variation when using different techniques makes it hard to compare and establish design rules. In this work, the energy levels of 33 organic semiconductors via cyclic voltammetry (CV), density functional theory, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy, and low&#8208;energy inverse photoelectron spectroscopy are determined. Solar cells are fabricated to obtain key device parameters and relate them to the significant differences in the energy levels and offsets obtained from different methods. In contrast to CV, the photovoltaic gap measured using photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) correlates well with the experimental device VOC. It is demonstrated that high&#8208;performing systems such as PM6:Y6 and WF3F:Y6, which are previously reported to have negligible ionization energy (IE) offsets (&#916;IE), possess sizable &#916;IE of &#8776;0.5&#160;eV, determined by PES. Using various D&#8211;A blends, it is demonstrated that &#916;IE plays a key role in charge generation. In contrast to earlier reports, it is shown that a vanishing &#916;IE is detrimental to device performance. Overall, these findings establish a solid base for reliably evaluating material energetics and interpreting property&#8211;performance relationships in organic solar cells.

In contrast to CV, the photovoltaic gap measured using photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) correlates well with the experimental device &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;. It is demonstrated that high-performing systems such as PM6:Y6 and WF3F:Y6, which are previously reported to have negligible ionization energy (IE) offsets (&#916;IE), possess sizable &#916;IE of &#8776;0.5&#160;eV, determined by PES. Using various D&#8211;A blends, it is demonstrated that &#916;IE plays a key role in charge generation. In contrast to earlier reports, it is shown that a vanishing &#916;IE is detrimental to device performance. Overall, these findings establish a solid base for reliably evaluating material energetics and interpreting property&#8211;performance relationships in organic solar cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Charge transport is a key process that dominates battery performance, and the microstructure of battery key components plays a central role in guiding the charge transport. By gradient design, optimal local charge&#8208;transport dynamics can be realized and high energy/power supported. Recent processes in the gradient design strategies of cathodes, lithium&#8208;metal anodes, and solid&#8208;state electrolytes are presented with future research directions highlighted.








Abstract
Charge transport is a key process that dominates battery performance, and the microstructures of the cathode, anode, and electrolyte play a central role in guiding ion and/or electron transport inside the battery. Rational design of key battery components with varying microstructure along the charge&#8208;transport direction to realize optimal local charge&#8208;transport dynamics can compensate for reaction polarization, which accelerates electrochemical reaction kinetics. Here, the principles of charge&#8208;transport mechanisms and their decisive role in battery performance are presented, followed by a discussion of the correlation between charge&#8208;transport regulation and battery microstructure design. The design strategies of the gradient cathodes, lithium&#8208;metal anodes, and solid&#8208;state electrolytes are summarized. Future directions and perspectives of gradient design are provided at the end to enable practically accessible high&#8208;energy and high&#8208;power&#8208;density batteries.

         <title>Direct Light Orbital Angular Momentum Detection in Mid&#8208;Infrared Based on the Type&#8208;II Weyl Semimetal TaIrTe4</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 29, July 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photodetector based on the type&#8208;II Weyl semimetal tantalum iridium telluride is designed with peculiar electrode geometries to directly detect the orbital angular momentum (OAM) order of the vertex beam in the mid&#8208;infrared wavelength. The helical phase gradient of light can be distinguished by a current winding around the optical beam axis, with a magnitude proportional to its quantized OAM mode number.








Abstract
The direct photocurrent detection capability of light orbital angular momentum (OAM) has recently been realized with topological Weyl semimetals, but it is limited to the near&#8208;infrared wavelength range. The extension of the direct OAM detection capability to the mid&#8208;infrared band, which is a wave band that plays an important role in a vast range of applications, has not yet been realized. This is because the photocurrent responses of most photodetectors are neither sensitive to the phase information nor efficient in the mid&#8208;infrared region. In this study, a photodetector based on the type&#8208;II Weyl semimetal tantalum iridium telluride (TaIrTe4) is designed with peculiar electrode geometries to directly detect the topological charge of the OAM using the orbital photogalvanic effect (OPGE). The results indicate that the helical phase gradient of light can be distinguished by a current winding around the optical beam axis, with a magnitude proportional to its quantized OAM mode number. The topologically enhanced responses in the mid&#8208;infrared region of TaIrTe4 further help overcome the low responsivity issues and finally render direct OAM detection capability. This study enables on&#8208;chip&#8208;integrated OAM detection, and thus OAM&#8208;sensitive focal plane arrays in the mid&#8208;infrared region.

         <title>Rapid Screen for Antiviral T&#8208;Cell Immunity with Nanowire Electrochemical Biosensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 29, July 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using complementary metal&#8722;oxide&#8722;semiconductor (CMOS)&#8208;compatible multichannel silicon&#8208;nanowire field&#8208;effect transistors, a device for rapid and label&#8208;free detection of human T&#8208;cell immune responses is developed. The generalizability of this approach is demonstrated by measuring T&#8208;cell responses against melanoma antigen MART1, common viruses CMV, EBV, flu, as well as emergent SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. Nanowire devices successfully assess SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8208;specific T&#8208;cells directly from peripheral blood samples of donors, demonstrating potential point&#8208;of&#8208;care applications in rapid detection of antigen&#8208;specific T cells.








Abstract
The ability to rapidly assess and monitor patient immune responses is critical for clinical diagnostics, vaccine design, and fundamental investigations into the presence or generation of protective immunity against infectious diseases. Recently, findings on the limits of antibody&#8208;based protection provided by B&#8208;cells have highlighted the importance of engaging pathogen&#8208;specific T&#8208;cells for long&#8208;lasting and broad protection against viruses and their emergent variants such as in SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. However, low&#8208;cost and point&#8208;of&#8208;care tools for detecting engagement of T&#8208;cell immunity in patients are conspicuously lacking in ongoing efforts to assess and control population&#8208;wide disease risk. Currently available tools for human T&#8208;cell analysis are time and resource&#8208;intensive. Using multichannel silicon&#8208;nanowire field&#8208;effect transistors compatible with complementary metal&#8722;oxide&#8722;semiconductor, a device designed for rapid and label&#8208;free detection of human T&#8208;cell immune responses is developed. The generalizability of this approach is demonstrated by measuring T&#8208;cell responses against melanoma antigen MART1, common and seasonal viruses CMV, EBV, flu, as well as emergent pandemic coronavirus, SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. Further, this device provides a modular and translational platform for optimizing vaccine formulations and combinations, offering quick and quantitative readouts for acquisition and persistence of T&#8208;cell immunity against variant&#8208;driven pathogens such as flu and pandemic SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2.

         <title>Structurally Resemblant Dopants Enhance Organic Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 29, July 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient doping strategy is applied to endow bright room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) of dibenzothiophene derivatives. The isomer dopants bearing close resemblance to host with matched highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels and small energy gap between singlet&#8208; and triplet&#8208;excited states enable bright RTP.








Abstract
Doping has shown very promising potential in endowing room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) properties of organic phosphors with minimal effort. Here, a new isomer design and doping strategy is reported that is applicable to dibenzothiophene (DBT) and its derivatives. Three isomers are synthesized to study the dopant effect on enhancing RTP of DBT derivatives. It is found that isomer dopants bearing close resemblance to the host with matched highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels and small energy difference between singlet&#8208; and triplet&#8208;excited states can yield efficient RTP for the doped system. Meanwhile, phosphorescence color from yellow to red is achieved by varying isomer dopants used for doping the DBT derivatives. This work represents an RTP enhancement strategy based on isomer design and doping to construct luminescent organic phosphors.

         <title>Isolated&#8208;Oxygen&#8208;Vacancy Hardening in Lead&#8208;Free Piezoelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 29, July 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy is developed for the hardening of piezoelectrics via the mediation of dopant&#8208;exclusive oxygen vacancies to overcome the long&#8208;term issue: the dilemma between the mechanical quality factor and piezoelectricity coefficient. The approach also makes the high&#8208;power performance superior to many state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art counterparts, offering a possible route to various piezoelectrics for high&#8208;end applications.








Abstract
Defect engineering is a well&#8208;established approach to customize the functionalities of perovskite oxides. In demanding high&#8208;power applications of piezoelectric materials, acceptor doping serves as the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art hardening approach, but inevitably deteriorates the electromechanical properties. Here, a new hardening effect associated with isolated oxygen vacancies for achieving well&#8208;balanced performances is proposed. Guided by theoretical design, a well&#8208;balanced performance of mechanical quality factor (Qm) and piezoelectric coefficient (d33) is achieved in lead&#8208;free potassium sodium niobate ceramics, where Qm increases by over 60% while d33 remains almost unchanged. By atomic&#8208;scale Z&#8208;contrast imaging, hysteresis measurement, and quantitative piezoresponse force microscopy analysis, it is revealed that the improved Qm results from the inhibition of both extrinsic and intrinsic losses while the unchanged d33 is associated with the polarization contributions being retained. More encouragingly, the hardening effect shows exceptional stability with increasing vibration velocity, offering potential in material design for practical high&#8208;power applications such as pharmaceutical extraction and ultrasonic osteotomes.

&lt;p&gt;A novel strategy is developed for the hardening of piezoelectrics via the mediation of dopant-exclusive oxygen vacancies to overcome the long-term issue: the dilemma between the mechanical quality factor and piezoelectricity coefficient. The approach also makes the high-power performance superior to many state-of-the-art counterparts, offering a possible route to various piezoelectrics for high-end applications.

&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Doping Compensation Enables High&#8208;Detectivity Infrared Organic Photodiodes for Image Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 29, July 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A doping compensation strategy is utilized to reduce the trap density and to enhance the external quantum efficiency simultaneously, leading to a greatly improved detectivity in infrared organic photodiodes. Consequently, high&#8208;pixel&#8208;density organic photodiodes arrays without pattering sensing layers are successfully applied in image capture.








Abstract
Infrared organic photodiodes have gained increasing attention due to their great application potentials in night vision, optical communication, and all&#8208;weather imaging. However, the commonly occurring high dark current and low detectivity impede infrared photodetectors from portable applications at room temperature. Herein, an efficient and generic doping compensation strategy is developed to improve the detectivity of infrared organic photodiodes. A series of n&#8208;type organic semiconductors is investigated, and it is found that doping compensation strategy not only reduces the trap density of states and dark currents, but also restrains the nonradiative recombination with improved charge transport and collection. As a result, an ultralow noise spectral density of 8&#160;&#215; 10&#8722;15 A Hz&#8722;1/2 as well as a high specific detectivity over 1013 Jones in 780&#8211;1070&#160;nm is achieved at room temperature. More importantly, the high&#8208;performance infrared organic photodiodes can be successfully applied in high&#8208;pixel&#8208;density image arrays without patterning sensing layers. These findings provide important compensation design insights that will be crucial to further improve the performance of infrared organic photodiodes in the future.

         <title>A Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Green OLED with 4500 h Lifetime and 20% External Quantum Efficiency by Optimizing the Emission Zone using a Single&#8208;Emission Spectrum Technique</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 29, July 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An accessible, fast procedure is shown to measure light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) emission zones with current density, different device structures, and ageing. The emission zone in an organic LED is shown to be controlled by emitter doping and to have a strong relationship with device degradation and lifetime. Using the resulting insights, record stability for a thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) organic LED is shown.








Abstract
Device optimization of light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) targets the most efficient conversion of electrically injected charges into emitted light. The emission zone in an LED is where charges recombine and light is emitted from. It is believed that the emission zone is strongly linked to device efficiency and lifetime. However, the emission zone size is below the optical diffraction limit, so it is difficult to measure. An accessible method based on a single emission spectrum that enables emission zone measurements with sub&#8208;second time resolution is shown. A procedure is introduced to study and control the emission zone of an LED system and correlate it with device performance. A thermally activated delayed fluorescence organic LED emission zone is experimentally measured over all luminescing current densities, while varying the device structure and while ageing. The emission zone is shown to be finely controlled by emitter doping because electron transport via the emitter is the charge&#8208;transport bottleneck of the system. Suspected quenching/degradation mechanisms are linked with the emission zone changes, device structure variation, and ageing. Using these findings, a device with an ultralong 4500 h T95 lifetime at 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2 with 20% external quantum efficiency is shown.

         <title>Nanoscale Antiferromagnetic Domain Imaging using Full&#8208;Field Resonant X&#8208;ray Magnetic Diffraction Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 29, July 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Full&#8208;field resonant X&#8208;ray magnetic diffraction microscopy enables nanoscale antiferromagnetic domain imaging of large&#8208;area bulk single crystals with very high spatial resolution (&#8776;150 nm) and high throughput. This novel technique visualizes antiferromagnetic domain walls and uncovers hitherto unknown mesoscopic antiferromagnetic structures in the spin&#8211;orbit Mott insulator Sr2IrO4.








Abstract
The physical properties of magnetic materials frequently depend not only on the microscopic spin and electronic structures, but also on the structures of mesoscopic length scales that emerge, for instance, from domain formations, or chemical and/or electronic phase separations. However, experimental access to such mesoscopic structures is currently limited, especially for antiferromagnets with net zero magnetization. Here, full&#8208;field microscopy and resonant magnetic X&#8208;ray diffraction are combined to visualize antiferromagnetic (AF) domains of the spin&#8211;orbit Mott insulator Sr2IrO4 with area over &#8776;0.1 mm2 and with spatial resolution as high as &#8776;150&#160;nm. With the unprecedented wide field of views and high spatial resolution, an intertwining of two AF domains on a length comparable to the measured average AF domain wall width of 545&#160;nm is revealed. This mesoscopic structure comprises a substantial portion of the sample surface, and thus can result in a macroscopic response unexpected from its microscopic magnetic structure. In particular, the symmetry analysis presented in this work shows that the inversion symmetry, which is preserved by the microscopic AF order, becomes ill&#8208;defined at the mesoscopic length scale. This result underscores the importance of this novel technique for a thorough understanding of the physical properties of antiferromagnets.

         <title>Fabrication of Arrays of Topological Solitons in Patterned Chiral Liquid Crystals for Real&#8208;Time Observation of Morphogenesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 29, July 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topological solitons of chiral liquid crystal (LC) are uniformly generated over a large area with periodic air pockets. Controlled thermal phase transition with air pockets enables real&#8208;time observation of morphogenesis of topological solitons transformed from topological defects. The platform provides insight into topological solitons at the other scales and can be applied to multiple applications requiring controlled LC structures.








Abstract
Topological solitons have knotted continuous field configurations embedded in a uniform background, and occur in cosmology, biology, and electromagnetism. However, real&#8208;time observation of their morphogenesis and dynamics is still challenging because their size and timescale are enormously large or tiny. Liquid crystal (LC) structures are promising candidates for a model&#8208;system to study the morphogenesis of topological solitons, enabling direct visualization due to the proper size and timescale. Here, a new&#160;way is found to rationalize the real&#8208;time observation of the generation and transformation of topological solitons using cholesteric LCs confined in patterned substrates. The experimental demonstration shows the topologically protected structures arise via the transformation of topological defects. Numerical modeling based on minimization of free energy closely reconstructs the experimental findings. The fundamental insights obtained from the direct observations pose new theoretical challenges in understanding the morphogenesis of different types of topological solitons within a broad range of scales.

         <title>Highly Potassiophilic Graphdiyne Skeletons Decorated with Cu Quantum Dots Enable Dendrite&#8208;Free Potassium&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 29, July 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An Al current collector modified by hierarchical N&#8208;doped carbon and graphdiyne composites is beneficial to reducing the local current density and increasing the potassiophilic sites, accordingly enabling excellent electrochemical performance for dendrite&#8208;free K&#8208;metal anode.








Abstract
Employing an Al foil current collector at the potassium anode side is an ideal choice to entail low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;energy potassium&#8208;metal batteries (PMBs). Nevertheless, the poor affinity between the potassium and the planar Al can cause uneven K plating/stripping and, hence, an undermined anode performance, which remains a significant challenge to be addressed. Herein, a nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon@graphdiyne (NC@GDY)&#8208;modified Al current collector affording potassiophilic properties is proposed, which simultaneously suppresses the dendrite growth and prolongs the lifespan of K anodes. The thin and light modification layer (7&#160;&#181;m thick, with a mass loading of 500&#160;&#181;g cm&#8722;2) is fabricated by directly growing GDY nanosheets interspersed with Cu quantum dots on NC polyhedron templates. As a result, symmetric cell tests reveal that the K@NC@GDY&#8208;Al electrode exhibits an unprecedented cycle life of over 2400 h at a 40% depth of discharge. Even at an 80% depth of discharge, the cell can still sustain for 850 h. When paired with a potassium Prussian blue cathode, the thus&#8208;assembled full cell demonstrates comparable capacity and rate performance with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art PMBs.

         <title>Molecular&#8208;Level Methylcellulose/MXene Hybrids with Greatly Enhanced Electrochemical Actuation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 29, July 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methylcellulose chains are introduced between MXene sheets to obtain molecular&#8208;level hybrid films with simultaneously enhanced ambient stability and wet strength. The hybrid films also show significantly enhanced actuation strain due to the enlarged layer distance and possible in&#8208;plane sliding of MXene. A hybrid&#8208;based soft actuator shows an unprecedentedly high modulus and a strain difference up to 0.541% under&#160;1&#160;V.








Abstract
Ti3C2Tx MXene film is promising for electrochemical actuators due to its high electrical conductivity and volumetric capacitance. However, its actuation performance is limited by the slow ion diffusion through the film and poor mechanical property in aqueous electrolytes. Here, molecular&#8208;level methylcellulose (MC)/MXene hybrid films are assembled with obviously enlarged layer distance, improved wet strength, and ambient stability. The hybrid films show significantly higher in&#8208;plane actuation strain in a liquid electrolyte. Based on direct strain measurements, in&#160;situ X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and ex&#160;situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses, the actuation enhancement can be ascribed to the enlarged layer distance allowing more water and ions to be intercalated/de&#8208;intercalated and MC&#8208;induced sliding of MXene sheets. The assembled soft actuator has a high Young's modulus of 1.93&#160;GPa and can be operated in air, generating a peak&#8208;to&#8208;peak strain difference up to 0.541% under a triangular wave voltage of &#177;1&#160;V&#160;and a blocking force of 4.7&#160;times its own weight.

         <title>Engineering a Kesterite&#8208;Based Photocathode for Photoelectrochemical Ammonia Synthesis from NOx Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 29, July 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rationally designed defect&#8208;engineered TiOx cocatalyst on a kesterite&#8208;based photocathode (CdS/Cu2ZnSnS4) for selective photoelectrochemical ammonia synthesis directly from NOx reduction is established. Synergistically outstanding light&#8208;absorption capability, efficient photogenerated charge transfer, and selective surface catalytic reaction are successfully unified, contributing to maximum 89.1% Faradaic efficiency (at 0.1&#160;V vs reversible hydrogen electrode) toward ammonia.








Abstract
Ammonia is a key chemical feedstock for industry as well as future carbon&#8208;free fuel and transportable vector for renewable energy. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) ammonia synthesis from NOx reduction reaction (NOxRR) provides not only a promising alternative to the energy&#8208;intensive Haber&#8211;Bosch process through direct solar&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion, but a sustainable solution for balancing the global nitrogen cycle by restoring ammonia from wastewater. In this work, selective ammonia synthesis from PEC NOxRR by a kesterite (Cu2ZnSnS4 [CZTS]) photocathode through loading defect&#8208;engineered TiOx cocatalyst on a CdS/CZTS photocathode (TiOx/CdS/CZTS) is demonstrated. The uniquely designed photocathode enables selective ammonia production from NOxRR, yielding up to 89.1% Faradaic efficiency (FE) (0.1&#160;V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) with a remarkable positive onset potential (0.38&#160;V vs RHE). By tailoring the amount of surface defective Ti3+ species, the adsorption of reactant NO3&#8722; and *NO2&#160;intermediate is significantly promoted while the full coverage of TiOx also suppresses NO2&#8722; liberation as a by&#8208;product, contributing to high ammonia selectivity. Further attempts on PEC ammonia synthesis from simulated wastewater show good FE of 64.9%, unveiling the potential of using the kesterite&#8208;based photocathode for sustainably restoring ammonia from nitrate&#8208;rich wastewater.

         <title>Immunoregulation in Diabetic Wound Repair with a Photoenhanced Glycyrrhizic Acid Hydrogel Scaffold</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 29, July 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a glycyrrhizic acid (GA) hybrid hydrogel is developed as an immunoregulatory scaffold for diabetic wound repair. This hybrid hydrogel consists of inorganic Zn2+&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembled GA as a first network and photoenhanced methyl acrylylated silk fibroin as a second network, realizing both excellent injectability and mechanical strength. Notably, this hybrid hydrogel could regulate macrophage responses without exogenous addition.








Abstract
M1 macrophage accumulation and excessive inflammation are commonly encountered issues in diabetic wounds and can fail in the healing process. Hence, hydrogel dressings with immunoregulatory capacity have great promise in the clinical practice of diabetic wound healing. However, current immunoregulatory hydrogels are always needed for complex interventions and high&#8208;cost treatments, such as cytokines and cell therapies. In this study, a novel glycyrrhizic acid (GA)&#8208;based hybrid hydrogel dressing with intrinsic immunoregulatory properties is developed to promote rapid diabetic wound healing. This hybrid hydrogel consists of interpenetrating polymer networks composed of inorganic Zn2+&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembled GA and photo&#8208;crosslinked methyl acrylated silk fibroin (SF), realizing both excellent injectability and mechanical strength. Notably, the SF/GA/Zn hybrid hydrogel can regulate macrophage responses in the inflammatory microenvironment, circumventing the use of any additives. The immunomodulatory properties of the hydrogel can be harnessed for safe and efficient therapeutics that accelerate the three phases of wound repair and serve as a promising dressing for the management of diabetic wounds.

         <title>Triggering Lattice Oxygen Activation of Single&#8208;Atomic Mo Sites Anchored on Ni&#8211;Fe Oxyhydroxides Nanoarrays for Electrochemical Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 29, July 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atomic Mo sites anchored on Ni&#8211;Fe oxyhydroxides nanoarrays are prepared, exhibiting superior performance toward the oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline media. In&#160;situ characterizations and the theoretical analysis collaboratively reveal that Mo incorporation triggers enhanced metal&#8211;oxygen covalency and improved reactivity of oxygen ligands, leading to feasible lattice oxygen oxidation mechanisms.








Abstract
Tuning the reactivity of lattice oxygen is of significance for lowering the energy barriers and accelerating the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, single&#8208;atomic Mo sites are anchored on Ni&#8211;Fe oxyhydroxide nanoarrays by a facile metal&#8211;organic&#8208;framework&#8208;derived strategy, exhibiting superior performance toward the OER in alkaline media. In&#160;situ electrochemical spectroscopy and isotope&#8208;labeling experiments reveal the involvement of lattice oxygen during OER cycles. Combining theoretical and experimental investigations of the electronic configuration, it is comprehensively confirmed that the incorporation of single&#8208;atomic Mo sites enables higher oxidation state of the metal and strengthened metal&#8211;oxygen hybridization, as well as the formation of oxidized ligand holes above the Fermi level. In a word, the considerable acceleration of water oxidation is achieved via enhancing the reactivity of lattice oxygen and triggering the lattice oxygen activation. This work may provide new insights for designing ideal electrocatalysts via tuning the chemical state and activating the anions ligands.

         <title>Giant Negative Magnetoresistance beyond Chiral Anomaly in Topological Material YCuAs2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 29, July 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A giant negative magnetoresistance (MR) is reported in the nonmagnetic Dirac material YCuAs2. The origin of the negative MR (&#8776;40%) is beyond the &#8220;chiral anomaly&#8221; mechanism and identified as vacancy&#8208;induced spin&#8208;dependent scattering. This finding suggests a unique way to introduce negative MR in nonmagnetic topological materials through defect engineering.








Abstract
The large negative magnetoresistance (MR) effect, which usually emerges in various magnetic systems, is a technologically important property for spintronics. Recently, the so&#8208;called &#8220;chiral anomaly&#8221; in topological semimetals offers an alternative to generate a considerable negative MR effect without utilizing magnetism. However, it requires that the applied magnetic field must be strictly along the electric current direction, which sets a strong limit for practical applications. Here, a giant negative MR effect is discovered with a value of up to &#8722;40% in 9 T at 2 K in the nonmagnetic Dirac material YCuAs2, which is not restricted to the specific configuration for applied magnetic fields. Based on magnetic susceptibility and NMR measurements, the giant negative MR effect is tightly connected with the unexpected spin&#8208;dependent scattering from vacancy&#8208;induced local moments, which is also beyond the classical Kondo effect. The present work not only offers an alternative route for spintronics based on nonmagnetic topological materials, but also helps to further understand the negative MR effect in topological materials.

         <title>Orbital Angular Momentum Multiplexing in Space&#8211;Time Thermoacoustic Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 29, July 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Space&#8211;time thermoacoustic metasurface possess unusual capacities to simultaneously manipulate sound field distributions and harmonic frequency responses. Along this frontier, a mode&#8208;frequency&#8208;division multiplexing technique is established with a superposition of vortex beams carrying orthogonal orbital&#8208;angular&#8208;momentum modes at distinct frequency harmonics. The synthesized dimensionality introduces entirely new physics and design philosophies to multiplexing schemes, promising unprecedented functionalities in acoustic communication devices.








Abstract
Multiplexing technology with increased information capacity plays a crucial role in the realm of acoustic communication. Different quantities of sound waves, including time, frequency, amplitude, phase, and orbital angular momentum (OAM), have been independently introduced as the physical multiplexing approach to allow for enhanced communication densities. An acoustic metasurface is decorated with carbon nanotube patches, which when electrically pumped and set to rotate, functions as a hybrid mode&#8208;frequency&#8208;division multiplexer with synthetic dimensions. Based on this spatiotemporal modulation, a superposition of vortex beams with orthogonal OAMs and symmetric harmonics are both numerically and experimentally demonstrated. Also, flexible combinations of OAM modes with diverse frequency shifts are obtained by transforming the azimuthal phase distributions, which inspires a mode&#8208;frequency&#8208;division multiplexing approach that significantly promotes the communication&#160;capacity.

A cytochrome c oxidase&#8208;like nanozyme, Cu&#8211;Ag nanoparticles, is demonstrated for nanocatalytic cancer therapy. The Cu&#8211;Ag nanozyme loaded with bioreductive predrug (AQ4N) unprecedentedly enables simultaneous starvation, ferroptosis, and chemical therapy with high specificity.

Abstract
Nanozymes, which are inorganic nanomaterials mimicking natural enzyme activities, are bringing enormous opportunities to theranostics. Herein, a cytochrome c oxidase&#8208;like nanozyme (copper&#8211;silver alloy nanoparticle, Cu&#8211;Ag NP) is demonstrated for nanocatalytic cancer therapy. Loaded with bioreductive predrug (AQ4N), this Cu&#8211;Ag nanozyme unprecedentedly enables simultaneous starvation, ferroptosis, and chemical therapy with high specificity, and is able to totally eliminate tumor and greatly prolong the survival rate for 4T1&#8208;tumor&#8208;bearing mice.

         <title>An Anode&#8208;Free Potassium&#8208;Metal Battery Enabled by a Directly Grown Graphene&#8208;Modulated Aluminum Current Collector</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 29, July 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefiting from a plasma&#8208;enhanced chemical vapor deposition setup integrated with a roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll configuration, a commercial Al foil is elaborately decorated with a graphene layer with strong adhesion and high surface energy, which enables a smooth and highly reversible K plating/stripping process. An anode&#8208;free K&#8208;metal full&#8208;cell using the as&#8208;synthesized substrate as the anode current collector displays improved performance.








Abstract
Potassium (K)&#8208;metal batteries have emerged as a promising energy&#8208;storage device owing to abundant K resources. An anode&#8208;free architecture that bypasses the need for anode host materials can deliver an elevated energy density. However, the poor efficiency of K plating/stripping on potassiophobic anode current collectors results in rapid K inventory loss and a short cycle life. Herein, commercial Al foils are decorated with an ultrathin graphene&#8208;modified layer (Al@G) through roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll plasma&#8208;enhanced chemical vapor deposition. By harnessing strong adhesion (10.52 N m&#8722;1) and a high surface energy (66.6 mJ m&#8722;2), the designed Al@G structure ensures a highly smooth and ordered K plating/stripping process. Consequently, during K&#8208;metal plating/stripping, Al@G can operate at a current density of up to 4.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and cyclic capacity of up to 4.0 mAh cm&#8722;2, with an ultralong lifespan of up to 1000 h at 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and stable cycling of up to 750 h under periodic current fluctuations of 0.1&#8211;2.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. In addition, a novel anode&#8208;free K&#8208;metal full&#8208;cell prototype enabled by Al@G anode current collectors is constructed, demonstrating ameliorative cyclic stability.

         <title>An NIR&#8208;II Photothermally Triggered &#8220;Oxygen Bomb&#8221; for Hypoxic Tumor Programmed Cascade Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 29, July 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
To obtain a second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) photothermally triggered oxygen release vehicle PSPP&#8208;Au980&#8208;D for hypoxic tumor treatment, NIR&#8208;II extinction photothermal&#8208;agent gold nanorods are fabricated on the surface of an oxygenated polymer nanocapsule through an innovative modified two&#8208;step seedless ex situ growth strategy. Under a customized programmed cascade therapy, superior hypoxic tumor suppression is achieved under mild conditions.








Abstract
Hypoxia, as a characteristic feature of solid tumors, has a close relationship with tumor resistance to photodynamic therapy (PDT) and chemotherapy. Perfluorocarbon (PFC) is reported to relieve hypoxic in solid tumors by acting as an oxygen carrier via several nanostructures. However, the oxygen delivery process is mostly driven by a concentration gradient, which is uncontrollable. Herein, a photothermally controlled &#8220;oxygen bomb&#8221; PSPP&#8208;Au980&#8208;D is designed by encapsulating a PFC core within a functionalized bilayer polymer shell. Near&#8208;infrared second window photothermal agent gold nanorods with excellent photo&#8208;to&#8208;heat energy&#8208;conversion ability are fabricated on the surface of the polymer shell via an innovative modified two&#8208;step seedless ex situ growth process to thermally trigger O2&#160;release. Then, a programmed cascade therapy strategy is customized for hypoxic orthotopic pancreatic cancer. First, PSPP&#8208;Au980&#8208;D is irradiated by a 980&#160;nm laser to photothermally trigger O2&#160;infusing into the hypoxic tumor microenvironment, which is accompanied by local hyperemia and doxorubicin release. Subsequently, a 680&#160;nm laser is used to generate singlet oxygen in the oxygenated tumor microenvironment for PDT. This choreographed programmed cascade therapy strategy will provide a new route for suppressing hypoxic tumor growth under mild conditions based on controllable and effective oxygen release.

         <title>General Synthesis and Solution Processing of Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanofibers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 29, July 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust template, i.e., nanofibrillated cellulose, can be employed for the synthesis of high&#8208;quality metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOF) materials with 1D nanofiber morphology. The good solution dispersibility and membrane formability of MOF nanofibers surpass traditional MOF powder materials, which facilitates their processing and application.








Abstract
By virtue of their extraordinarily high surface areas, ordered pore structures, various compositions, and rich functionality, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are of great interest in diverse fields such as gas separation, sensing, catalysis, energy, environment science, and biomedicine. However, the difficulty in processing MOF crystals and controlling the MOF superstructure is emerging as a critical issue in their application. Herein, it is reported that a robust template, i.e., nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC), can be used for the synthesis of MOF materials with 1D nanofiber morphology. NFC@MOF core&#8211;shell nanofibers with a uniform network structure and high aspect ratios can be prepared by use of this template. The small crystal size, flexibility, and good dispersity of the NFC@MOF nanofibers make it convenient for the macroscale assembly and solution processing of MOF materials. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study is demonstrated wherein freestanding MOF nanofiber membranes represent good performance in applications of water treatment and heterogeneous catalysis reaction. This general synthesis and solution&#8208;processing strategy may herald a new era in promoting the industrial application of MOFs.

         <title>Robust Artificial Interphases Constructed by a Versatile Protein&#8208;Based Binder for High&#8208;Voltage Na&#8208;Ion Battery Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 29, July 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional sericin protein/poly(acrylic acid) (SP/PAA) binder is developed, which shows enhanced ionic conductivity and electrochemical stability. The highly hydrophilic nature and strong H&#8208;bond interaction between crosslinking SP and PAA leads to a uniform coating of the binder layer, which serves as an artificial interphase to help stabilize the cathode electrolyte interface, protect the cathode from electrolyte corrosion, suppress Mn&#8208;dissolution, and ensure electrode integrity during cycling.








Abstract
The multiple issues of unstable electrode/electrolyte interphases, sluggish reaction kinetics, and transition&#8208;metal (TM) dissolution have long greatly affected the rate and cycling performance of cathode materials for Na&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, a multifunctional protein&#8208;based binder, sericin protein/poly(acrylic acid) (SP/PAA), is developed, which shows intriguing physiochemical properties to address these issues. The highly hydrophilic nature and strong H&#8208;bond interaction between crosslinking SP and PAA leads to a uniform coating of the binder layer, which serves as an artificial interphase on the high&#8208;voltage Na4Mn2Fe(PO4)2P2O7 cathode material (NMFPP). Through systematic experiments and theoretical calculations, it is shown that the SP/PAA binder is electrochemically stable at high voltages and possesses increased ionic conductivity due to the interaction between sericin and electrolyte anion ClO4&#8722;, which can provide additional sodium&#8208;migration paths with greatly reduced energy barriers. Besides, the strong interaction force between the binder and the NMFPP can effectively protect the cathode from electrolyte corrosion, suppress Mn&#8208;dissolution, stabilize crystal structure, and ensure electrode integrity during cycling. Benefiting from these merits, the SP/PAA&#8208;based NMFPP electrode displays enhanced rate and cycling performance. Of note, the universality of the SP/PAA binder is further confirmed on Na3V2(PO4)2F3. It is believed that the versatile protein&#8208;based binder is enlightening for the development of high&#8208;performance batteries.

         <title>An Anode&#8208;Free Zn&#8211;Graphite Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 29, July 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Zn&#8211;graphite battery in an anode&#8208;free configuration is demonstrated, which is enabled by efficient Zn plating&#8211;stripping on a zincophilic Ag coating and anion intercalation&#8211;deintercalation. The constructed cell exhibits long cycling life of over 1000 cycles with a capacity retention of 82% and high specific energy of 79&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1.








Abstract
The anode&#8208;free battery concept is&#160;proposed to pursue the aspiration of energy&#8208;dense, rechargeable metal batteries, but this has not been achieved with dual&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, the first anode&#8208;free Zn&#8211;graphite battery enabled by efficient Zn plating&#8211;stripping onto a silver&#8208;coated Cu substrate is demonstrated. The silver coating guides uniform Zn deposition without dendrite formation or side reaction over a wide range of electrolyte concentrations, enabling the construction of anode&#8208;free Zn cells. In addition, the graphite cathode operates efficiently under reversible bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide anion (TFSI&#8722;) intercalation without anodic corrosion. An extra high&#8208;potential TFSI&#8722; intercalation plateau is recognized at 2.75&#160;V, contributing to the high capacity of graphite cathode. Thanks to efficient Zn plating&#8211;stripping and TFSI&#8722; intercalation&#8211;deintercalation, an anode&#8208;free Zn&#8211;graphite dual&#8208;ion battery that exhibits impressive cycling stability with 82% capacity retention after 1000 cycles is constructed. At the same time, a specific energy of 79&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 based on the mass of cathode and electrolyte is achieved, which is over two times higher than conventional Zn&#8211;graphite batteries (&lt;30&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1).

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Ligand Strategy to Regulate the Nucleation and Growth of Lead Chromate Photoanodes for Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 29, July 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;ligand growth strategy in fabricating high&#8208;quality PbCrO4 thin film is demonstrated by slowing down crystal growth and inducing faster heterogeneous nucleation during annealing process. The dual&#8208;ligand strategy can effectively improve crystallinity, reduce defect density, and subsequently boosts superior charge separation efficiency up to &#8776;90%.








Abstract
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting for renewable hydrogen production has been regarded as a promising solution to utilize solar energy. However, most photoelectrodes still suffer from poor film quality and poor charge separation properties, mainly owing to the possible formation of detrimental defects including microcracks and grain boundaries. Herein, a molecular coordination engineering strategy is developed by employing acetylacetone (Acac) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) dual ligands to regulate the nucleation and crystal growth of the lead chromate (PbCrO4) photoanode, resulting in the formation of a high&#8208;quality film with large grain size, well&#8208;stitched grain boundaries, and reduced oxygen vacancies defects. With these efforts, the nonradiative charge recombination is efficiently suppressed, leading to the enhancement of its charge separation efficiency from 47% to 90%. After decorating with Co&#8211;Pi cocatalyst, the PbCrO4 photoanode achieves a photocurrent density of 3.15&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#160;V (vs RHE under simulated AM1.5G) and an applied bias photon&#8208;to&#8208;current efficiency (ABPE) of 0.82%. This work provides a new strategy to modulate the nucleation and growth of high&#8208;quality photoelectrodes for efficient PEC water splitting.

         <title>Synergistic Cr2O3@Ag Heterostructure Enhanced Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to CO</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 29, July 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in operando electrochemically synthesized Cr2O3@Ag heterostructure electrocatalyst exhibits superb selectivity, activity, and stability toward CO2 reduction to CO, resulting from the synergistic Cr2O3&#8211;Ag heterostructure induced stabilization of CO2&#8226;&#8722;/*COOH intermediates.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic CO2RR to produce value&#8208;added chemicals and fuels has been recognized as a promising means to reduce the reliance on fossil resources; it is, however, hindered due to the lack of high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts. The effectiveness of sculpturing metal/metal oxides (MMO) heterostructures to enhance electrocatalytic performance toward CO2RR has been well documented, nonetheless, the precise synergistic mechanism of MMO remains elusive. Herein, an in operando electrochemically synthesized Cr2O3&#8211;Ag heterostructure electrocatalyst (Cr2O3@Ag) is reported for efficient electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO. The obtained Cr2O3@Ag can readily achieve a superb FECO of 99.6% at &#8722;0.8&#160;V (vs RHE) with a high JCO of 19.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. These studies also confirm that the operando synthesized Cr2O3@Ag possesses high operational stability. Notably, operando Raman spectroscopy studies reveal that the markedly enhanced performance is attributable to the synergistic Cr2O3&#8211;Ag heterostructure induced stabilization of CO2&#8226;&#8722;/*COOH intermediates. DFT calculations unveil that the metallic&#8208;Ag&#8208;catalyzed CO2 reduction to CO requires a 1.45&#160;eV energy input to proceed, which is 0.93&#160;eV higher than that of the MMO&#8208;structured Cr2O3@Ag. The exemplified approaches in this work would be adoptable for design and development of high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts for other important reactions.

         <title>Dangling Octahedra Enable Edge States in 2D Lead Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 29, July 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The low&#8208;energy and long&#8208;lived edge states of 2D lead halide perovskites arise from the rotational symmetry elevation at the crystal layer edges, which are enabled by dangling PbBr6 octahedra at the lattice terminals. These dangling octahedra with enhanced atomic vibrations can give rise to localized electronic states that enable an effective electron transport from the interior to layer edges.








Abstract
The structural reconstruction at the crystal layer edges of 2D lead halide perovskites (LHPs) leads to unique edge states (ES), which are manifested by prolonged carrier lifetime and reduced emission energy. These special ES&#160;can effectively enhance the optoelectronic performance of devices, but their intrinsic origin and working mechanism remain elusive. Here it is demonstrated that the ES of a family of 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper LHPs [BA2CsPb2Br7, BA2MAPb2Br7, and BA2MA2Pb3Br10 (BA = butylammonium; MA = methylammonium)] arise from the rotational symmetry elevation of the PbBr6 octahedra dangling at the crystal layer edges. These dangling octahedra give rise to localized electronic states that enable an effective transport of electrons from the interior to layer edges, and the population of electrons in both the interior states and the ES can be manipulated via controlling the external fields. Moreover, the abundant phonons, activated by the dangling octahedra, can interact with electrons to facilitate radiative recombination, counterintuitive to the suppressive role commonly observed in conventional semiconductors. This work unveils the intrinsic atomistic and electronic origins of ES in 2D LHPs, which can stimulate the exploration of ES&#8208;based exotic optoelectronic properties and the corresponding design of high&#8208;performance devices for these emergent low&#8208;dimensional semiconductors.

Chemical instability within conventional hybrid perovskites is addressed using inorganic CsPbI3&#8208;based systems. A novel &#947;&#8208;CsPb1&#8722;xTbx(IBr)3 perovskite is fabricated with the help of bulk and surface passivation methods, the combination of which ensures ambient&#8208;processed and stable inorganic lead halide perovskite solar cells that produce 19% power conversion efficiency with &gt;90%&#160;thermal&#8208;stability over 300 h at 85&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Realizing photoactive and thermodynamically stable all&#8208;inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) remains a challenging task within halide perovskite photovoltaic (PV) research. Here, a dual strategy for realizing efficient inorganic mixed halide perovskite PV devices based on a terbium&#8208;doped solar absorber, that is, CsPb1&#8722;xTbxI2Br, is reported, which undertakes a bulk and surface passivation treatment in the form of CsPb1&#8722;xTbxI2Br quantum dots, to maintain a photoactive &#947;&#8208;phase under ambient conditions and with significantly improved operational stability. Devices fabricated from these air&#8208;processed perovskite thin films exhibit an air&#8208;stable power conversion efficiency (PCE) that reaches 17.51% (small&#8208;area devices) with negligible hysteresis and maintains &gt;90%&#160;of the initial efficiency when operating for 600 h under harsh environmental conditions, stemming from the combined effects of the dual&#8208;protection strategy. This approach is further examined within large&#8208;area PSC modules (19.8 cm2 active area) to realize 10.94% PCE and &gt;30&#160;days ambient stability, as well as within low&#8208;bandgap &#947;&#8208;CsPb0.95Tb0.05I2.5Br0.5 (Eg&#160;= 1.73&#160;eV) materials, yielding 19.01% (18.43% certified) PCE.

In&#8208;depth phase analysis of developed Na1&#8722;xTMO2 cathode materials, NFMO with P2&#8208; and O3&#8208;type phases (NFMO&#8208;P2/O3) is offered. As a result, the synergetic effect of the simultaneous existence of P&#8208; and O&#8208;type phases with their unique structures allows an extraordinary level of capacity retention in a wide range of voltage (1.5&#8211;4.5 V).








Abstract
The layered sodium transition metal oxide, NaTMO2 (TM = transition metal), with a binary or ternary phases has displayed outstanding electrochemical performance as a new class of strategy cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, an in&#8208;depth phase analysis of developed Na1&#8722;xTMO2 cathode materials, Na0.76Ni0.20Fe0.40Mn0.40O2 with P2&#8208; and O3&#8208;type phases (NFMO&#8208;P2/O3) is offered. Structural visualization on an atomic scale is also provided and the following findings are unveiled: i) the existence of a mixed&#8208;phase intergrowth layer distribution and unequal distribution of P2 and O3 phases along two different crystal plane indices and ii) a complete reversible charge/discharge process for the initial two cycles that displays a simple phase transformation, which is unprecedented. Moreover, first&#8208;principles calculations support the evidence of the formation of a binary NFMO&#8208;P2/O3 compound, over the proposed hypothetical monophasic structures (O3, P3, O&#8242;3, and P2 phases). As a result, the synergetic effect of the simultaneous existence of P&#8208; and O&#8208;type phases with their unique structures allows an extraordinary level of capacity retention in a wide range of voltage (1.5&#8211;4.5 V). It is believed that the insightful understanding of the proposed materials can introduce new perspectives for the development of high&#8208;voltage cathode materials for SIBs.

         <title>Construction of N, P Co&#8208;Doped Carbon Frames Anchored with Fe Single Atoms and Fe2P Nanoparticles as a Robust Coupling Catalyst for Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 29, July 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel in situ doping&#8211;adsorption&#8211;phosphidation strategy is discovered for the synthesis of well&#8208;defined Fe single atoms&#8211;Fe2P nanoparticles/N, P co&#8208;doped carbon frames catalyst, and a new concept of &#8220;atomically dispersed Fe&#63743;N4/Fe&#63743;P coupled active centers&#8221; for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction is put forward.








Abstract
A coupling catalyst of highly dispersed N, P co&#8208;doped carbon frames (NPCFs) anchored with Fe single atoms (SAs) and Fe2P nanoparticles (NPs) is synthesized by a novel in situ doping&#8211;adsorption&#8211;phosphatization strategy for the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The optimized Fe SAs&#8208;Fe2P NPs/NPCFs&#8208;2.5 catalyst shows a superior ORR activity and stability in 0.5 m H2SO4 and 0.1 m KOH, respectively. Theoretical calculations reveal a synergistic effect, in that the existence of Fe2P weakens the adsorption of ORR intermediates on active sites and lowers the reaction free energy. The doped P atoms with a strong electron&#8208;donating ability elevate the energy level of Fe&#8208;3d orbitals and facilitate the adsorption of O2. The active Fe atoms exist in a low oxidation state and are less positively charged, and they serve as an electron reservoir capable of donating and releasing electrons, thus improving the ORR activity. Operando and in situ characterization results indicate that the atomically dispersed Fe&#63743;N4/Fe&#63743;P coupled active centers in the Fe SAs&#8208;Fe2P NPs/NPCFs&#8208;2.5 catalyst are characteristic of the different catalytic mechanisms in acidic and alkaline media. This work proposes a novel idea for constructing coupling catalysts with atomic&#8208;level precision and provides a strong reference for the development of high&#8208;efficiency ORR electrocatalysts for practical application.

         <title>A Bionic Interface to Suppress the Coffee&#8208;Ring Effect for Reliable and Flexible Perovskite Modules with a Near&#8208;90% Yield Rate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 29, July 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction of a superhydrophilic bionic interface layer (Bio&#8208;IL) significantly suppresses the coffee&#8208;ring effect during printing of large&#8208;area perovskite films via regulating the nucleation rate (&#965;N) and radial transport rate (&#965;RT) of the perovskite precursor, which induces a homogeneous large&#8208;area flexible perovskite film and high&#8208;performance inverted flexible perovskite solar cells with an efficiency of 21.08%.








Abstract
The inhomogeneity, poor interfacial contact, and pinholes caused by the coffee&#8208;ring effect severely affect the printing reliability of flexible perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, inspired by the bio&#8208;glue of barnacles, a bionic interface layer (Bio&#8208;IL) of NiOx/levodopa is introduced to suppress the coffee&#8208;ring effect during printing perovskite modules. The coordination effect of the sticky functional groups in Bio&#8208;IL can pin the three&#8208;phase contact line and restrain the transport of perovskite colloidal particles during the printing and evaporation process. Moreover, the sedimentation rate of perovskite precursor is accelerated due to the electrostatic attraction and rapid volatilization from an extraordinary wettability. The superhydrophilic Bio&#8208;IL affords an even spread over a large&#8208;area substrate, which boosts a complete and uniform liquid film for heterogeneous nucleation as well as crystallization. Perovskite films on different large&#8208;area substrates with negligible coffee&#8208;ring effect are printed. Consequently, inverted flexible PSCs and perovskite solar modules achieve a high efficiency of 21.08% and 16.87%, respectively. This strategy ensures a highly reliable reproducibility of printing PSCs with a near 90% yield rate.

         <title>An Open&#8208;Environment Tactile Sensing System: Toward Simple and Efficient Material Identification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 29, July 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intelligent triboelectric tactile sensing system is proposed that combines triboelectric nanogenerator technology and deep&#8208;learning technology. Independent of touch conditions and external environmental conditions, the tactile sensing system can achieve accurate, simple, and real&#8208;time material identification.








Abstract
Robotic perception can have simple and effective sensing functions that are unreachable for humans using only the isolated tactile perception method, with the assistance of a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG). However, the reliability of triboelectric sensors remains a major challenge due to the inherent environmental limitations. Here, an intelligent tactile sensing system that combines a TENG and deep&#8208;learning technology is proposed. Using a triboelectric triple tactile sensor array, typical characteristics of each testing material can be maintained stably even under different contact conditions (touch conditions and external environmental conditions) by extracting features from three independent electrical signals as well as the normalized output signals. Furthermore, a convolutional neural network model is integrated, and a high accuracy of 96.62% is achieved in a material identification task. The tactile sensing system is exhibited to an open environment for material identification and the real&#8208;time demonstration. Compared to the complex process that humans must integrate multiple sensing (touching and viewing) to accomplish tactile perception, the proposed sensing system shows a huge advantage in cognitive learning for the visually impaired, biomimetic prosthetics, and virtual spaces construction.

&lt;p&gt;An intelligent triboelectric tactile sensing system is proposed that combines triboelectric nanogenerator technology and deep-learning technology. Independent of touch conditions and external environmental conditions, the tactile sensing system can achieve accurate, simple, and real-time material identification.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robotic perception can have simple and effective sensing functions that are unreachable for humans using only the isolated tactile perception method, with the assistance of a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG). However, the reliability of triboelectric sensors remains a major challenge due to the inherent environmental limitations. Here, an intelligent tactile sensing system that combines a TENG and deep-learning technology is proposed. Using a triboelectric triple tactile sensor array, typical characteristics of each testing material can be maintained stably even under different contact conditions (touch conditions and external environmental conditions) by extracting features from three independent electrical signals as well as the normalized output signals. Furthermore, a convolutional neural network model is integrated, and a high accuracy of 96.62% is achieved in a material identification task. The tactile sensing system is exhibited to an open environment for material identification and the real-time demonstration. Compared to the complex process that humans must integrate multiple sensing (touching and viewing) to accomplish tactile perception, the proposed sensing system shows a huge advantage in cognitive learning for the visually impaired, biomimetic prosthetics, and virtual spaces construction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mesopore&#8208;Rich Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C Catalyst with FeN4&#8211;O&#8211;NC Single&#8208;Atom Sites Delivers Remarkable Oxygen Reduction Reaction Performance in Alkaline Media</title>

An Fe single&#8208;atom catalyst (FeN4&#8208;O&#8211;NCR) based on O,N&#8208;codoped carbon nanorods delivers remarkable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance in a primary zinc&#8211;air battery. The Fe atoms in FeN4&#8211;O&#8211;NCR are coordinated by four in&#8208;plane N atoms and a subsurface axial oxygen atom that bridge between N&#8208;doped graphene sheets, thus optimizing the Fe d&#8208;band center position and binding energies of ORR intermediates.








Abstract
Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts offer excellent performance for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline media. With a view toward boosting the intrinsic ORR activity of Fe single&#8208;atom sites in Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts, fine&#8208;tuning the local coordination of the Fe sites to optimize the binding energies of ORR intermediates is imperative. Herein, a porous FeN4&#8211;O&#8211;NCR electrocatalyst rich in catalytically accessible FeN4&#8211;O sites (wherein the Fe single atoms are coordinated to four in&#8208;plane nitrogen atoms and one subsurface axial oxygen atom) supported on N&#8208;doped carbon nanorods (NCR) is reported. Fe K&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) verifies the presence of FeN4&#8211;O active sites in FeN4&#8211;O&#8211;NCR, while density functional theory calculations reveal that the FeN4&#8211;O coordination offers a lower energy and more selective 4&#8208;electron/4&#8208;proton ORR pathway compared to traditional FeN4 sites. Electrochemical tests validate the outstanding intrinsic activity of FeN4&#8211;O&#8211;NCR for alkaline ORR, outperforming Pt/C and almost all other M&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts reported to date. A primary zinc&#8211;air battery constructed using FeN4&#8211;O&#8211;NCR delivers a peak power density of 214.2&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2 at a current density of 334.1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, highlighting the benefits of optimizing the local coordination of iron single atoms.

         <title>A Transparent, High&#8208;Performance, and Stable Sb2S3 Photoanode Enabled by Heterojunction Engineering with Conjugated Polycarbazole Frameworks for Unbiased Photoelectrochemical Overall Water Splitting Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 29, July 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conformably depositing a thin layer of conjugated polycarbazole framework onto the surface of transparent Sb2S3 thin film creates a type&#8208;II heterojunction, leading to a transparent, high&#8208;performance, and stable hybrid photoanode. When coupled with a bandgap&#8208;matched back&#8208;illuminated Si photocathode, the unbiased photoelectrochemical tandem device demonstrates an unprecedented efficiency of 5.21% toward solar&#8208;driven overall water splitting.








Abstract
Developing low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;performance, and durable photoanodes is essential in solar&#8208;driven photoelectrochemical (PEC) energy conversion. Sb2S3 is a low&#8208;bandgap (&#8776;1.7&#160;eV) n&#8208;type semiconductor with a maximum theoretical solar conversion efficiency of &#8776;28% for PEC water splitting. However, bulk Sb2S3 exhibits opaque characteristics and suffers from severe photocorrosion, and thus the use of Sb2S3 as a photoanode material remains underexploited. This study describes the design and fabrication of a transparent Sb2S3&#8208;based photoanode by conformably depositing a thin layer of conjugated polycarbazole frameworks (CPF&#8208;TCzB) onto the Sb2S3 film. This structural design creates a type&#8208;II heterojunction between the CPF&#8208;TCzB and the Sb2S3 with a suitable band&#8208;edge energy offset, thereby, greatly enhancing the charge separation efficiency. The CPF&#8208;TCzB/Sb2S3 hybrid photoanode exhibits a remarkable photocurrent density of 10.1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#160;V vs reversible hydrogen electrode. Moreover, the thin CPF&#8208;TCzB overlayer effectively inhibits photocorrosion of the Sb2S3 and enables long&#8208;term operation for at least 100&#160;h with &#8776;10% loss in photocurrent density. Furthermore, a standalone unbiased PEC tandem device comprising a CPF&#8208;TCzB/Sb2S3 photoanode and a back&#8208;illuminated Si photocathode can achieve a record solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen conversion efficiency of 5.21%, representing the most efficient PEC water splitting device of its kind.

         <title>Directing Charge Transfer in a Chemical&#8208;Bonded BaTiO3@ReS2 Schottky Heterojunction for Piezoelectric Enhanced Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 29, July 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The BaTiO3@ReS2&#160;piezo&#8208;assisted photocatalysis system with interfacial Re&#63743;O covalent bond exhibits excellent synergy between piezoelectric and photocatalytic. The polarization field induced by the piezoelectric response can lower the Schottky barrier and thus reduce the transfer resistance of photogenerated electrons. The interfacial Re&#63743;O covalent bond ensures the formation of a seamless contact interface and acts as the &#8220;bridge&#8221; for the electron transfer.








Abstract
The piezo&#8208;assisted photocatalysis system, which can utilize solar energy and mechanical energy simulteneously, is promising but still challenging in the environmental remediation field. In this work, a novel metal&#8211;semiconductor BaTiO3@ReS2 Schottky heterostructure is designed and it shows high&#8208;efficiency on piezo&#8208;assisted photocatalytic molecular oxygen activation. By combining experiment and calculation results, the distorted metal&#8208;phase ReS2 nanosheets are found to be closely anchored on the surface of the BaTiO3 nanorods, through interfacial Re&#63743;O covalent bonds. The Schottky heterostructure not only forms electron&#8208;transfer channels but also exhibits enhanced oxygen activation capacity, which are helpful to produce more superoxide radicals. The polarization field induced by the piezoelectric BaTiO3 can lower the Schottky barrier and thus reduce the transfer resistance of photogenerated electrons directing to the ReS2. As a result of the synergy effect between the two components, the BaTiO3@ReS2 exhibits untrahigh activity for degradation of pollutants with an apparent rate constant of 0.133 min&#8722;1 for piezo&#8208;assisted photocatalysis, which is 16.6 and 2.44 times as that of piezocatalysis and photocatalysis, respectively. This performance is higher than most reported BaTiO3&#8208;based piezo&#8208;assisted photocatalysis systems. This work paves the way for the design of high&#8208;efficiency piezo&#8208;assisted photocatalytic materials for environmental remediation through using green energies in nature.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Narrowband Pure&#8208;Red OLEDs with External Quantum Efficiencies up to 36.1% and Ultralow Efficiency Roll&#8208;Off</title>

         <dc:description>
A series of narrowband red emitters with superb photophysical properties is developed by way of novel B/N/O&#8208;based polycyclic multiple resonance structures. The red OLEDs incorporating these emitters sensitized by the phosphor display state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance with EQE exceeding 36%, ultralow efficiency roll&#8208;off, ultrahigh brightness, and good device lifetime.








Abstract
High&#8208;color&#8208;purity blue and green organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) have been resolved thanks to the development of B/N&#8208;based polycyclic multiple resonance (MR) emitters. However, due to the derivatization limit of B/N polycyclic structures, the design of red MR emitters remains challenging. Herein, a series of novel red MR emitters is reported by para&#8208;positioning N&#8211;&#960;&#8211;N, O&#8211;&#960;&#8211;O, B&#8211;&#960;&#8211;B pairs onto a benzene ring to construct an MR central core. These emitters can be facilely and modularly synthesized, allowing for easy fine&#8208;tuning of emission spectra by peripheral groups. Moreover, these red MR emitters display excellent photophysical properties such as near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), fast radiative decay rate (kr) up to 7.4 &#215; 107 s&#8722;1, and most importantly, narrowband emission with full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 32&#160;nm. Incorporating these MR emitters, pure red OLEDs sensitized by phosphor realize state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art device performances with external quantum efficiency (EQE) exceeding 36%, ultralow efficiency roll&#8208;off (EQE remains as high as 25.1% at the brightness of 50&#160;000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2), ultrahigh brightness over 130&#160;000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, together with good device lifetime.

         <title>Asymmetric Substitution of End&#8208;Groups Triggers 16.34% Efficiency for All&#8208;Small&#8208;Molecule Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 29, July 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric substitution of terminal groups is first applied in small&#8208;molecule donors. A record efficiency of 16.34% is achieved for binary all&#8208;small&#8208;molecule organic solar cells. A unique phenomenon of merits integration is reported rather than the balance between Voc and Jsc, which is generally observed in asymmetric substitution of nonfullerene acceptors.








Abstract
Asymmetric substitution of end&#8208;groups is first applied in molecular donors. Three commonly used end&#8208;groups of 2&#8208;ethylhexyl cyanoacetate (CA), 2&#8208;ethylhexyl rhodanine (Reh), and 1H&#8208;indene&#8208;1,3(2H)&#8208;dione (ID) are combined to construct a series of symmetric and asymmetric donors. Correspondingly, the asymmetric donors SM&#8208;CA&#8208;Reh and SM&#8208;CA&#8208;ID show largely increased dipole moments (2.14 and 3.39 D, respectively) and enhanced aggregation propensity, as compared to those of symmetric donors of SM&#8208;CA, SM&#8208;Reh, and SM&#8208;ID. Using N3 as acceptor, interestingly, SM&#8208;CA&#8208;Reh integrates the photovoltaic characteristics of high fill factor (FF) for SM&#8208;CA and high short&#8208;circuit current density for SM&#8208;Reh, and delivers a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.34% with a high FF of 77.5%, which is much higher than 15.41% for SM&#8208;CA and 14.76% for SM&#8208;Reh. However, SM&#8208;CA&#8208;ID and SM&#8208;ID give the lower PCE of 8.20% and 2.76%. Characterization results suggest that the &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction mainly dictates the packing morphology of blend films instead of dipole effect or crystallinity. Mono&#8208;substitution of Reh facilitates the molecular demixing appropriately but keeps the characteristic of the fine bicontinuous network of SM&#8208;CA:N3. SM&#8208;CA&#8208;Reh:N3 shows more efficient exciton extraction, higher hole transport, and better miscibility. These results well explain the merits integration and improved photovoltaic performance.

Photodetectors
A photodetector based on the type&#8208;II Weyl semimetal TaIrTe4 is designed by Dong Sun and co&#8208;workers in article number 2201229 to directly detect the orbital angular momentum (OAM) order of the vertex beam in the mid&#8208;infrared wavelength. The helical phase gradient of light can be distinguished by a current whose magnitude is proportional to the OAM mode number. This detector can be integrated into a focal plane array that can resolve multiple optical parameters of a target.

In article number 2202026, Ying Cheng, Xiaojun Liu, Johan Christensen, and co&#8208;workers report an orbital&#8208;angular&#8208;momentum multiplexing technology based on space&#8208;time thermoacoustic metasurfaces for enhanced communication densities. In analogy to the Chinese story &#8220;Monkey King Prays for Rain&#8221;, multifaceted weather signals, i.e, lightning, thunder and rain, etc., are synchronously transmitted through multipath orbital&#8208;angular&#8208;momentum beams.

Topological Soliton Arrays
In article number 2201749, Ivan Smalyukh, Dong Ki Yoon, and co&#8208;workers report a new way to rationalize the real&#8208;time observation of the generation and transformation of topological solitons using cholesteric liquid crystals confined in patterned substrates. The line textures are cholesteric fingers of the third kind (CF&#8208;3s), in which 1D topological solitons called twist walls are stabilized by two twist disclination lines, which are nucleated and grown from the air pockets on the top view. This image represents that the CF&#8208;3s array is formed like an infinite maze.

         <title>Targeting the Microenvironment of Vulnerable Atherosclerotic Plaques: An Emerging Diagnosis and Therapy Strategy for Atherosclerosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 29, July 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the characteristics of the microenvironment of vulnerable plaques, nanomedicine targeting strategies for assessing plaque vulnerability by imaging are systematically summarized, developments in construction of stimuli&#8208;responsive nanoplatforms and surface&#8208;functionalized nanoagents to boost the efficacy of plaque stabilization therapy are highlighted, and existing challenges and prospects in the fields of diagnosis and therapy of atherosclerosis based on nanomaterials are discussed.








Abstract
Atherosclerosis is considered one of the primary causes of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Unpredictable rupture of the vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques triggers adverse cardiovascular events such as acute myocardial syndrome and even sudden cardiac death. Therefore, assessing the vulnerability of atherosclerotic plaques and early intervention are of significance in reducing CVD mortality. Nanomedicine possesses tremendous advantages in achieving the integration of the diagnosis and therapy of atherosclerotic plaques because of its magnetic, optical, thermal, and catalytic properties. Based on the pathological characteristics of vulnerable plaques, stimuli&#8208;responsive nanoplatforms and surface&#8208;functionalized nanoagents are designed and have drawn great attention for accomplishing the precise imaging and treatment of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques due to their superior properties, such as high bioavailability, lesion&#8208;targeting specificity, on&#8208;demand cargo release, and low off&#8208;target damage. Here, the characteristics of vulnerable plaques are generalized, and some targeted strategies for boosting the accuracy of plaque vulnerability evaluation by imaging and the efficacy of plaque stabilization therapy (including antioxidant therapy, macrophage depletion therapy, regulation of lipid metabolism therapy, anti&#8208;inflammation therapy, etc.) are systematically summarized. In addition, existing challenges and prospects in this field are discussed, and it is believed to provide new thinking for the diagnosis and treatment of CVDs in the near future.

The key and emerging development of promising materials for CO2 capture, catalytic conversion, and direction utilization is presented in this authoritative, comprehensive, and critical review. The promises of advanced dual&#8208;functional materials for integrated capture and in situ conversion and artificial&#8208;intelligence&#8208;driven smart material study are particularly highlighted. This review can serve as a guide to sustainable CO2&#8208;management schemes.








Abstract
With the rising level of atmospheric CO2 worsening climate change, a promising global movement toward carbon neutrality is forming. Sustainable CO2 management based on carbon capture and utilization (CCU) has garnered considerable interest due to its critical role in resolving emission&#8208;control and energy&#8208;supply challenges. Here, a comprehensive review is presented that summarizes the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art progress in developing promising materials for sustainable CO2 management in terms of not only capture, catalytic conversion (thermochemistry, electrochemistry, photochemistry, and possible combinations), and direct utilization, but also emerging integrated capture and in situ conversion as well as artificial&#8208;intelligence&#8208;driven smart material study. In particular, insights that span multiple scopes of material research are offered, ranging from mechanistic comprehension of reactions, rational design and precise manipulation of key materials (e.g., carbon nanomaterials, metal&#8211;organic frameworks, covalent organic frameworks, zeolites, ionic liquids), to industrial implementation. This review concludes with a summary and new perspectives, especially from multiple aspects of society, which summarizes major difficulties and future potential for implementing advanced materials and technologies in sustainable CO2 management. This work may serve as a guideline and road map for developing CCU material systems, benefiting both scientists and engineers working in this growing and potentially game&#8208;changing area.

         <title>Strain Engineering: A Boosting Strategy for Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 29, July 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strain engineering is a prospective means to break the bottlenecks of photocatalysts, such as low light&#8208;absorption efficiency and high carrier&#8208;recombination rate. The recent advances of strain engineering are summarized from its basics, creations, characterizations and simulations, as well as the potential applications in photocatalysis. Moreover, a vision for the future strained photocatalysts is also put forward.








Abstract
Whilst the photocatalytic technique is considered to be one of the most significant routes to address the energy crisis and global environmental challenges, the solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency is still far from satisfying practical industrial requirements, which can be traced to the suboptimal bandgap and electronic structure of photocatalysts. Strain engineering is a universal scheme that can finely tailor the bandgap and electronic structure of materials, hence supplying a novel avenue to boost their photocatalytic performance. Accordingly, to explore promising directions for certain breakthroughs in strained photocatalysts, an overview on the recent advances of strain engineering from the basics of strain effect, creations of strained materials, as well as characterizations and simulations of strain level is provided. Besides, the potential applications of strain engineering in photocatalysis are summarized, and a vision for the future controllable&#8208;electronic&#8208;structure photocatalysts by strain engineering is also given.

     alt="Strain Engineering: A Boosting Strategy for Photocatalysis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strain engineering is a prospective means to break the bottlenecks of photocatalysts, such as low light-absorption efficiency and high carrier-recombination rate. The recent advances of strain engineering are summarized from its basics, creations, characterizations and simulations, as well as the potential applications in photocatalysis. Moreover, a vision for the future strained photocatalysts is also put forward.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst the photocatalytic technique is considered to be one of the most significant routes to address the energy crisis and global environmental challenges, the solar-to-chemical conversion efficiency is still far from satisfying practical industrial requirements, which can be traced to the suboptimal bandgap and electronic structure of photocatalysts. Strain engineering is a universal scheme that can finely tailor the bandgap and electronic structure of materials, hence supplying a novel avenue to boost their photocatalytic performance. Accordingly, to explore promising directions for certain breakthroughs in strained photocatalysts, an overview on the recent advances of strain engineering from the basics of strain effect, creations of strained materials, as well as characterizations and simulations of strain level is provided. Besides, the potential applications of strain engineering in photocatalysis are summarized, and a vision for the future controllable-electronic-structure photocatalysts by strain engineering is also given. Finally, perspectives on the challenges for future strain-promoted photocatalysis are discussed, placing emphasis on the creation and decoupling of strain effect, and the modification of theoretical frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Anhydrous Fast Proton Transport Boosted by the Hydrogen Bond Network in a Dense Oxide&#8208;Ion Array of &#945;&#8208;MoO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The kinetic property of inserted charge carriers in a battery electrode dominates the power density of the system. In this work, the fast proton&#8208;transfer mechanism in the unique dense framework of &#945;&#8208;MoO3 is decoded. The hydrogen bond network boosts the proton transport and thus realizes a proton battery with high rate capabilities and long life.








Abstract
Developing high&#8208;power battery chemistry is an urgent task to buffer fluctuating renewable energies and achieve a sustainable and flexible power supply. Owing to the small size of the proton and its ultrahigh mobility in water via the Grotthuss mechanism, aqueous proton batteries are an attractive candidate for high&#8208;power energy storage devices. Grotthuss proton transfer is ultrafast owing to the hydrogen&#8208;bonded networks of water molecules. In this work, similar continuous hydrogen bond networks in a dense oxide&#8208;ion array of solid &#945;&#8208;MoO3 are discovered, which facilitate the anhydrous proton transport even without structural water. The fast proton transfer and accumulation that occurs during (de)intercalation in &#945;&#8208;MoO3 is unveiled using both experiments and first&#8208;principles calculations. Coupled with a zinc anode and a superconcentrated Zn2+/H+ electrolyte, the proton&#8208;transport mechanism in anhydrous hydrogen&#8208;bonded networks realizes an aqueous MoO3&#8211;Zn battery with large capacity, long life, and fast charge&#8211;discharge abilities.

         <title>Kirigami&#8208;Inspired Pressure Sensors for Wearable Dynamic Cardiovascular Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A kirigami&#8208;inspired pressure sensor is developed for wearable dynamic cardiovascular monitoring. Utilizing the vertical kirigami&#8208;inspired structure and a simple fabrication process, the sensor provides an ascendant way for wearable bioelectronics to overcome motion artifacts when monitoring human pulse signals, thus representing a solid advancement toward personalized cardiovascular monitoring in the era of the Internet of things.








Abstract
Continuously and accurately monitoring pulse&#8208;wave signals is critical to prevent and diagnose cardiovascular diseases. However, existing wearable pulse sensors are vulnerable to motion artifacts due to the lack of proper adhesion and conformal interface with human skin during body movement. Here, a highly sensitive and conformal pressure sensor inspired by the kirigami structure is developed to measure the human pulse wave on different body artery sites under various prestressing pressure conditions and even with body movement. COMSOL multiphysical field coupling simulation and experimental testing are used to verify the unique advantages of the kirigami structure. The device shows a superior sensitivity (35.2&#160;mV Pa&#8722;1) and remarkable stability (&gt;84&#160;000 cycles). Toward practical applications, a wireless cardiovascular monitoring system is developed for wirelessly transmitting the pulse signals to a mobile phone in real&#8208;time, which successfully distinguished the pulse waveforms from different participants. The pulse waveforms measured by the kirigami inspired pressure sensor are as accurate as those provided by the commercial medical device. Given the compelling features, the sensor provides an ascendant way for wearable electronics to overcome motion artifacts when monitoring pulse signals, thus representing a solid advancement toward personalized healthcare in the era of the Internet of Things.

         <title>Vapor Lubrication for Reducing Water and Ice Adhesion on Poly(dimethylsiloxane) Brushes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vapor lubrication is developed to reduce the adhesion of water drops, even ice, on the surface. The results demonstrate a significantly lower limit departure drop size, and higher water harvesting efficiency. Potential applications in drop manipulation and deicing are also shown.








Abstract
Fast removal of small water drops from surfaces is a challenging issue in heat transfer, water collection, or anti&#8208;icing. Poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) brushes show good prospects to reach this goal because of their low adhesion to liquids. To further reduce adhesion of water drops, here, the surface to the vapor of organic solvents such as toluene or n&#8208;hexane is exposed. In the presence of such vapors, water drops slide at lower tilt angle and move faster. This is mainly caused by the physisorption of vapor and swelling of the PDMS brushes, which serves as a lubricating layer. Enhanced by the toluene vapor lubrication, the limit departure volume of water drop on PDMS brushes decreases by one order of magnitude compared to that in air. As a result, the water harvesting efficiency in toluene vapor increases by 65%. Benefits of vapor lubrication are further demonstrated for de&#8208;icing: driven by gravity, frozen water drops slide down the vertical PDMS brush surface in the presence of vapor.

         <title>A Seawater&#8208;Corrosion&#8208;Resistant and Isotropic Zero Thermal Expansion (Zr,Ta)(Fe,Co)2 Alloy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nowadays, zero thermal expansion (ZTE) alloys are challenged by other environmental instabilities beyond the dimensional stability. Here, a ZTE alloy, Zr0.8Ta0.2Fe1.7Co0.3, is studied, which shows multiple stabilities, including dimensional stability (ZTE, &#945;l&#160;= 0.21(&#177;2) &#215; 10&#8722;6 K&#8722;1 from 5 to 360 K), shape stability (isotropic), cycling stability, and environmental stability.








Abstract
Zero thermal expansion (ZTE) alloys as dimensionally stable materials are usually challenged by harsh environmental erosion, since ZTE and corrosion resistance are generally mutually exclusive. Here, a high&#8208;performance alloy, Zr0.8Ta0.2Fe1.7Co0.3, is reported, that shows isotropic ZTE behavior (&#945;l&#160;= 0.21(2) &#215; 10&#8722;6 K&#8722;1) in a wide temperature range of 5&#8211;360 K, high corrosion resistance in a seawater&#8208;like solution compared with classic Invar and stainless Invar, and excellent cyclic thermal and structural stabilities. Such stabilities are attributed to the cubic symmetry, the controllable magnetic order, and the spontaneously formed passive film with Ta and Zr chemical modifications. The results are evidenced by X&#8208;ray/neutron diffraction, microscopy, spectroscopy, and electrochemistry investigations. Such multiple stabilities have the potential to broaden the robust applications of ZTE alloys, especially in marine services.

         <title>Recent Advances in Encapsulation of Flexible Bioelectronic Implants: Materials, Technologies, and Characterization Methods</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The state of the art and recent advances in encapsulations of flexible bioelectronic chronic implants are reviewed. The materials, deposition and application technologies, and cutting&#8208;edge characterization methods are described in detail. Smart encapsulations integrated into microfabrication, patterned, and actively interacting with the surrounding tissues are also highlighted.








Abstract

         <title>Instantaneous High&#8208;Resolution Visual Imaging of Latent Fingerprints in Water Using Color&#8208;Tunable AIE Pincer Complexes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The instantaneous visualization of latent fingerprints (LFPs) is developed by using a series of water&#8208;soluble terpyridine zinc complexes as aggregation&#8208;induced emission probes in pure water under UV light or ambient sunlight. Remarkably, LFPs can be visualized within seconds including details at the Level 3, shedding light on the potential security protection and criminal investigation in various scenarios.








Abstract
Instant visualization of latent fingerprints is developed by using a series of water&#8208;soluble terpyridine zinc complexes as aggregation&#8208;induced emission probes in pure water, under UV light or ambient sunlight. By simply soaking, or spraying with an aqueous solution of the probe, bright yellow fluorescence images with high contrast and resolution are readily developed on various surfaces including tinfoil, glass, paper, steel, leather, and ceramic tile. Remarkably, latent fingerprints can be visualized within seconds including details of whorl and sweat pores. The color of emission can be tuned from blue to orange by modifying the pincer ligands, allowing direct imaging under sunlight. These inexpensive, water&#8208;resistant, and color&#8208;tunable probes provide a practical approach for latent fingerprints recording and analysis, security protection, as well as criminal investigation in different scenarios.

         <title>Efficient Low&#8208;Grade Heat Conversion and Storage with an Activity&#8208;Regulated Redox Flow Cell via a Thermally Regenerative Electrochemical Cycle</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rational regulation on the activities of redox couples at different temperatures has been demonstrated as an effective method to boost thermoelectric conversion in thermally regenerative electrochemical cycle (TREC) systems. This TREC system operates on a pair of reversible electrochemical reactions accompanying thermally&#8208;induced phase transitions during charging and discharging, which significantly boosts the thermoelectric performance of a TREC system.








Abstract
Efficient and cost&#8208;effective technologies are highly desired to convert the tremendous amount of low&#8208;grade waste heat to electricity. Although the thermally regenerative electrochemical cycle (TREC) has attracted increasing attention recently, the unsatisfactory thermal&#8208;to&#8208;electrical conversion efficiency and low power density limit its practical applications. In this work, a thermosensitive Nernstian&#8208;potential&#8208;driven strategy in the TREC system is demonstrated to boost its temperature coefficient, power density, and thermoelectric conversion efficiency by rationally regulating the activities of redox couples at different temperatures. With a Zn anode and [Fe(CN)6]4&#8722;/3&#8722;&#8208;guanidinium as the catholyte, the TREC flow cell presents an unprecedented average temperature coefficient of &#8722;3.28&#160;mV K&#8722;1, and achieves an absolute thermoelectric efficiency of 25.1% and apparent thermoelectric efficiency of 14.9% relative to the Carnot efficiency in the temperature range of 25&#8211;50&#160;&#176;C at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. In addition, a thermoelectric power density of 1.98&#160;mW m&#8722;2 K&#8722;2 is demonstrated, which is more than 7 times the highest power density of reported TREC systems. This activity regulation strategy can inspire research into high&#8208;efficiency and high&#8208;power TREC devices for practical low&#8208;grade heat harnessing.

         <title>Theory&#8208;Driven Design of a Cationic Accelerator for High&#8208;Performance Electrolytic MnO2&#8211;Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cationic accelerator effectively facilitates rapid cations migration in an electrolyte and adequate charge transfer at the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface, benefiting the deposition/dissolution processes of both Mn2+ and Zn2+ cations to simultaneously improve the kinetics of cathodic MnO2/Mn2+ and anodic Zn/Zn2+ reactions, thereby enabling high&#8208;performance MnO2&#8211;Zn batteries with high energy efficiency and long&#8208;term cycle stability.








Abstract
Aqueous electrolytic MnO2&#8211;Zn batteries are considered as one of the most promising energy&#8208;storage devices for their cost effectiveness, high output voltage, and safety, but their electrochemical performance is limited by the sluggish kinetics of cathodic MnO2/Mn2+ and anodic Zn/Zn2+ reactions. To overcome this critical challenge, herein, a cationic accelerator (CA) strategy is proposed based on the prediction of first&#8208;principles calculations. Poly(vinylpyrrolidone) is utilized as a model to testify the rational design of the CA strategy. It manifests that the CA effectively facilitates rapid cations migration in electrolyte and adequate charge transfer at electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface, benefiting the deposition/dissolution processes of both Mn2+ and Zn2+ cations to simultaneously improve kinetics of cathodic MnO2/Mn2+ and anodic Zn/Zn2+ reactions. The resulting MnO2&#8211;Zn battery regulated by CA exhibits large reversible capacities of 455 mAh g&#8211;1 and 3.64 mAh cm&#8211;2 at 20 C, as well as a long lifespan of 2000 cycles with energy density retention of 90%, achieving one of the best overall performances in the electrolytic MnO2&#8211;Zn batteries. This comprehensive work integrating theoretical prediction with experimental studies provides opportunities to the development of high&#8208;performance energy&#8208;storage devices.

         <title>Magnetic Microswarm and Fluoroscopy&#8208;Guided Platform for Biofilm Eradication in Biliary Stents</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A proposed magnetic microswarm, consisting of urchin&#8208;like MUCR@MLMD, with controlled motility on a curved surface, restricted space accessibility, and swarm enhancement effects is expected to be of great value in treating bacterial biofilm infections associated with medical implants in situ. Moreover, a fluoroscopy&#8208;imaging&#8208;guided microswarm with rapid endoscopic delivery is demonstrated for biofilm eradication deep inside the body with high time efficiency.








Abstract
Biofilm eradication from medical implants is of fundamental importance, and the treatment of biofilm&#8208;associated pathogen infections on inaccessible biliary stents remains challenging. Magnetically driven microrobots with controlled motility, accessibility to the tiny lumen, and swarm enhancement effects can physically disrupt the deleterious biostructures while not developing drug resistance. Magnetic urchin&#8208;like capsule robots (MUCRs) loaded with magnetic liquid metal droplets (MLMDs, antibacterial agents) are designed using natural sunflower pollen, and the therapeutic effect of swarming MUCR@MLMDs is explored for eradicating complex mixtures of bacterial biofilm within biliary stents collected from patients. The external magnetic field triggers the emergence of the microswarm and induces MLMDs to transform their shape into spheroids and rods with sharp edges. The inherent natural microspikes of MUCRs and the obtained sharp edges of MLMDs actively rupture the dense biological matrix and multiple species of embedded bacterial cells by exerting mechanical force, finally achieving synergistic biofilm eradication. The microswarm is precisely and rapidly deployed into the biliary stent via endoscopy in 10 min. Notably, fluoroscopy imaging is used to track and navigate the locomotion of microswarm in biliary stents in real&#8208;time. The microswarm has great potential for treating bacterial biofilm infections associated with medical&#160;implants.

         <title>Untangling the Mechanisms of Lattice Distortions in Biogenic Crystals across Scales</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel dark&#8208;field X&#8208;ray microscopy (DFXM) method is used to provide unprecedented information on large biogenic crystals across scales. Detailed analysis in 3D establishes correlations between local nanoscale lattice distortions, chemical composition, and the formation process of the biogenic crystal as a whole. Most importantly, it allows a number of mechanisms that drive the process of biomineral formation to be untangled.








Abstract
Biomineralized structures are complex functional hierarchical assemblies composed of biomineral building blocks joined together by an organic phase. The formation of individual mineral units is governed by the cellular tissue component that orchestrates the process of biomineral nucleation, growth, and morphogenesis. These processes are imprinted in the structural, compositional, and crystallographic properties of the emerging biominerals on all scales. Measurement of these properties can provide crucial information on the mechanisms that are employed by the organism to form these complex 3D architectures and to unravel principles of their functionality. Nevertheless, so far, this has only been possible at the macroscopic scale, by averaging the properties of the entire composite assembly, or at the mesoscale, by looking at extremely small parts of the entire picture. In this study, the newly developed synchrotron&#8208;based dark&#8208;field X&#8208;ray microscopy method is employed to study the link between 3D crystallographic properties of relatively large calcitic prisms in the shell of the mollusc Pinna nobilis and their local lattice properties with extremely high angular resolution down to 0.001&#176;. Mechanistic links between variations in local lattice parameters and spacing, crystal orientation, chemical composition, and the deposition process of the entire mineral unit are unraveled.

         <title>2D&#8208;Topology&#8208;Seeded Graphitization for Highly Thermally Conductive Carbon Fibers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D&#8208;topology&#8208;seeded graphitization strategy effectively generates a new species of highly thermally conductive carbon fibers. Strong mechanical strength and high thermal conductivity up to 850 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 are simultaneously realized, which are one order of magnitude more conductive than commercial PAN&#8208;based carbon fibers. These fibers have great potential for lightweight thermal&#8208;management materials, high&#8208;power electronics, and energy storage.








Abstract
Highly thermally conductive carbon fibers (CFs) have become an important material to meet the increasing demand for efficient heat dissipation. To date, high thermal conductivity has been only achieved in specific pitch&#8208;based CFs with high crystallinity. However, obtaining high graphitic crystallinity and high thermal conductivity beyond pitch&#8208;CFs remains a grand challenge. Here, a 2D&#8208;topology&#8208;seeded graphitization method is presented to mediate the topological incompatibility in graphitization by seeding 2D graphene oxide (GO) sheets into the polyacrylonitrile (PAN) precursor. Strong mechanical strength and high thermal conductivity up to 850 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 are simultaneously realized, which are one order of magnitude higher in conductivity than commercial PAN&#8208;based CFs. The self&#8208;oxidation and seeded graphitization effect generate large crystallite size and high orientation to far exceed those of conventional CFs. Topologically seeded graphitization, verified in experiments and simulations, allows conversion of the non&#8208;graphitizable into graphitizable materials by incorporating 2D seeds. This method extends the preparation of highly thermally conductive CFs, which has great potential for lightweight thermal&#8208;management materials.

         <title>Printable and Highly Stretchable Viscoelastic Conductors with Kinematically Reconstructed Conductive Pathways</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stretch&#8208;induced kinematic reorganization of Ag flakes in a viscoelastic polymer matrix can lead to spontaneous formation of new and efficient conductive pathways with enhanced conductivity, successfully addressing the conductivity&#8211;stretchability dilemma. This study establishes a fundamentally new approach to fabricate filler&#8208;reinforced stretchable conductors, paving the way for the future development of polymer composites for soft, stretchable electronics.








Abstract
Printable and stretchable conductors based on metallic&#8208;filler&#8208;reinforced polymer composites that can maintain high electrical conductivity at large strains are essential for emerging applications in wearable electronics, soft robotics, and bio&#8208;integrated devices. Regulating microstructures of conductive fillers during mechanical deformations is the key to reconstructing the conductive pathway and retaining high electrical conductivity, which has proven to be challenging. Here, it is reported that Ag flakes can spontaneously reorganize inside a viscoelastic, liquid&#8208;like polymer matrix by cyclic mechanical stretching, resulting in reconstructed microstructures and forming highly efficient and stable conductive pathways. Consequently, the electrical conductivities of the resultant composites can be dramatically enhanced by &#8776;4&#8211;8 orders of magnitude and reach &#8776;104 S cm&#8722;1. The stretch&#8208;induced kinematic movements of Ag flakes inside the polymer matrix, together with the reorganization and stabilization mechanisms, are unraveled and validated by the dissipative particle dynamics simulations. This unique phenomenon enables high&#8208;performance stretchable conductors to be fabricated with significantly reduced conductive fillers. The printable and stretchable composites presented here hold great promise for use in soft and stretchable electronics, as demonstrated in stretchable light&#8208;emitting diode arrays and wearable electronics.

         <title>Metalloid&#8208;Cluster Ligands Enabling Stable and Active FeN4&#8208;Ten Motifs for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
p&#8208;Block metalloid clusters (e.g., Ten) are found to be able to effectively mimic the role of molecular ligands in enzymes. When incorporated into a pyrolyzed FeN4&#8208;carbon framework, the obtained FeN4&#8208;Ten catalyst not only mimics the coordination chemistry and catalytic behavior of CYP enzymes, but also keeps the stable nature as a heterogeneous catalyst.








Abstract
In nature, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is catalyzed by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes containing heme iron centers with an axial thiolate ligand (FeN4&#8208;S), which are among the most finely developed catalysts by natural selection. However, the exceptional ORR activity and selectivity of CYP enzymes originate from their non&#8208;rigid and self&#8208;adaptive coordination network with molecular ligands, which sacrifices the stability of the active motifs under electrochemical reaction conditions. Here, a design strategy to circumvent this dilemma by incorporating Fe&#8208;N4 motifs into carbon matrices instead of the protein scaffold and replacing the axial molecular thiolate ligand with a stable tellurium cluster (Ten) is demonstrated. Theoretical calculations indicate a moderate interaction between Fe 3d and Te 5p orbitals once n&#160;&gt; 2, allowing the Fe&#63743;Te bond to dynamically change its strength to adaptively facilitate the intermediate steps during the ORR process, which renders FeN4&#8208;Ten active sites with superior ORR activity. This adaptive behavior mimics the conformational dynamics of an enzyme during the reaction, but retains the stability nature as a heterogeneous catalyst. The experiments validate that the as&#8208;designed catalyst with a characterized FeN4&#8208;Ten structure outperforms the commercial Pt/C catalyst both on activity and stability.

         <title>Confined Assembly of Colloidal Nanorod Superstructures by Locally Controlling Free&#8208;Volume Entropy in Nonequilibrium Fluids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Confined assembly of colloidal nanorods is achieved by locally controlling free&#8208;volume entropy near the three&#8208;phase contact line and optimized self&#8208;assembly thermodynamic conditions. By designing the shape of liquid bridge, nanorod&#8208;superstructure microassembly arrays with long&#8208;range order and designable geometry are fabricated, including microwires, microrings, and orthogonal&#8208;oriented patterns, which exhibit programmable polarized fluorescence emission and polarization&#8208;dependent photoresponse.








Abstract

&lt;p&gt;Confined assembly of colloidal nanorods is achieved by locally controlling free-volume entropy near the three-phase contact line and optimized self-assembly thermodynamic conditions. By designing the shape of liquid bridge, nanorod-superstructure microassembly arrays with long-range order and designable geometry are fabricated, including microwires, microrings, and orthogonal-oriented patterns, which exhibit programmable polarized fluorescence emission and polarization-dependent photoresponse.

         <title>Catalytic Growth of Ultralong Graphene Nanoribbons on Insulating Substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Micrometer&#8208;long graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) with widths of &#8776;2 nm are directly grown on insulating hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) substrates through nanoparticle&#8208;catalyzed chemical vapor deposition. These ultranarrow GNRs feature a typical bandgap of &#8776;1 eV, which is suitable for fabricating field&#8208;effect devices. Remarkably, the as&#8208;grown GNRs are crystallographically aligned with the h&#8208;BN substrate, forming 1D moir&#233; superlattices.








Abstract
Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) with widths of a few nanometers are promising candidates for future nanoelectronic applications due to their structurally tunable bandgaps, ultrahigh carrier mobilities, and exceptional stability. However, the direct growth of micrometer&#8208;long GNRs on insulating substrates, which is essential for the fabrication of nanoelectronic devices, remains an immense challenge. Here, the epitaxial growth of GNRs on an insulating hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) substrate through nanoparticle&#8208;catalyzed chemical vapor deposition is reported. Ultranarrow GNRs with lengths of up to 10&#160;&#181;m are synthesized. Remarkably, the as&#8208;grown GNRs are crystallographically aligned with the h&#8208;BN substrate, forming 1D moir&#233; superlattices. Scanning tunneling microscopy reveals an average width of 2&#160;nm and a typical bandgap of &#8776;1&#160;eV for similar GNRs grown on conducting graphite substrates. Fully atomistic computational simulations support the experimental results and reveal a competition between the formation of GNRs and carbon nanotubes during the nucleation stage, and van der Waals sliding of the GNRs on the h&#8208;BN substrate throughout the growth stage. This&#160;study provides a scalable, single&#8208;step method for growing micrometer&#8208;long narrow GNRs on insulating substrates, thus opening a route to explore the performance of high&#8208;quality GNR devices and the fundamental physics of 1D moir&#233; superlattices.

         <title>Assembly of AIEgen&#8208;Based Fluorescent Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanosheets and Seaweed Cellulose Nanofibrils for Humidity Sensing and UV&#8208;Shielding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Seaweed cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs)&#8208;based composites, with strong fluorescence emission sensitive to relative humidity, are fabricated by integrating 4.0 wt% aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission luminogen (AIEgen)&#8208;based 2D metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanosheets in a water suspension. The composite films also show efficient UV&#8208;shielding capacity without compromise of the optical transmittance and excellent mechanical properties, owing to the metal&#8211;carboxylate coordination between the 2D MOF nanosheets and the CNFs.








Abstract
Integrating synthetic low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials such as metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanosheets with a sustainable biopolymer is a promising strategy to endow composites with attractive structural and functional properties for expanded applications. Herein, aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission luminogen (AIEgen)&#8208;based MOF bulk crystals are successfully exfoliated into ultrathin 2D nanosheets. Seaweed cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) are assembled with low amounts (0.3 to 4.0&#160;wt%) of the 2D nanosheets to generate luminescent composites. The 2D nanosheets are adsorbed onto the CNFs in dilute water suspensions owing to the flexibility of the MOF nanosheets and the high aspect ratio of the CNFs. Transparent films are prepared by solution casting from a water suspension of the CNF&#8208;MOF assembly. The fluorescence emission of the composite films is enhanced because of the favored affinity between MOF nanosheets and CNFs. Remarkably, these films demonstrate excellent UV&#8208;shielding capacity and high optical transmittance at the visible wavelength range. The composite films also show reversible changes in fluorescence emission intensity in response to ambient humidity. The tensile strength and modulus of the composite films are also enhanced owing to the increased adhesion between CNFs through the adsorbed MOF nanosheets. This work provides a novel pathway to fabricate luminescent CNFs&#8208;based composites with tunable optical properties for functional materials.

         <title>Local Spin&#8208;State Tuning of Iron Single&#8208;Atom Electrocatalyst by S&#8208;Coordinated Doping for Kinetics&#8208;Boosted Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atomically dispersed monovalent iron(I) site with a medium&#8208;spin state is developed to promote cleavage of the N&#8801;N bonds and facilitate the rate&#8208;determining step of N2 hydrogenation kinetics.








Abstract
The electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (e&#8208;NRR) is envisaged as alternative technique to the Haber&#8211;Bosch process for NH3 synthesis. However, how to develop highly active e&#8208;NRR catalysts faces daunting challenges. Herein, a viable strategy to manipulate local spin state of isolated iron sites through S&#8208;coordinated doping (FeSA&#8208;NSC) is reported. Incorporation of S in the coordination of FeSA&#8208;NSC can induce the transition of spin&#8208;polarization configuration with the formation of a medium&#8208;spin&#8208;state of Fe (t2g6 eg1), which is beneficial for facilitating eg electrons to penetrate the antibonding &#960;&#8208;orbital of nitrogen. As a consequence, a record&#8208;high current density up to 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 can be achieved, together with a high NH3 selectivity of &#8776;10% in a flow cell reactor. Both experimental and theoretical analyses indicate that the monovalent Fe(I) atomic center in the FeSA&#8208;NSC after the S doping accelerates the N2 activation and protonation in the rate&#8208;determining step of *N2 to *NNH.

         <title>Simultaneous One&#8208;Pot Interpenetrating Network Formation to Expand 3D Processing Capabilities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot photoinitiated reaction strategy is utilized to create tough interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) hydrogels that are amenable to processing modalities such as Digital Light Processing based 3D printing and microfluidic fabrication of microparticles. The mechanical properties of these IPN hydrogels are highly tunable with optimal formulations exhibiting high toughness and low hysteresis despite the high water content.








Abstract
The incorporation of a secondary network into traditional single&#8208;network hydrogels can enhance mechanical properties, such as toughness and loading to failure. These features are important for many applications, including as biomedical materials; however, the processing of interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) hydrogels is often limited by their multistep fabrication procedures. Here, a one&#8208;pot scheme for the synthesis of biopolymer IPN hydrogels mediated by the simultaneous crosslinking of two independent networks with light, namely: i) free&#8208;radical crosslinking of methacrylate&#8208;modified hyaluronic acid (HA) to form the primary network and ii) thiol&#8211;ene crosslinking of norbornene&#8208;modified HA with thiolated guest&#8211;host assemblies of adamantane and &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin to form the secondary network, is reported. The mechanical properties of the IPN hydrogels are tuned by changing the network composition, with high water content (&#8776;94%) hydrogels exhibiting excellent work of fracture, tensile strength, and low hysteresis. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the IPN hydrogels are implemented as low&#8208;viscosity Digital Light Processing resins to fabricate complex structures that recover shape upon loading, as well as in microfluidic devices to form deformable microparticles. Further, the IPNs are cytocompatible with cell adhesion dependent on the inclusion of adhesive peptides.

     alt="Simultaneous One-Pot Interpenetrating Network Formation to Expand 3D Processing Capabilities"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A one-pot photoinitiated reaction strategy is utilized to create tough interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) hydrogels that are amenable to processing modalities such as Digital Light Processing based 3D printing and microfluidic fabrication of microparticles. The mechanical properties of these IPN hydrogels are highly tunable with optimal formulations exhibiting high toughness and low hysteresis despite the high water content.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incorporation of a secondary network into traditional single-network hydrogels can enhance mechanical properties, such as toughness and loading to failure. These features are important for many applications, including as biomedical materials; however, the processing of interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) hydrogels is often limited by their multistep fabrication procedures. Here, a one-pot scheme for the synthesis of biopolymer IPN hydrogels mediated by the simultaneous crosslinking of two independent networks with light, namely: i) free-radical crosslinking of methacrylate-modified hyaluronic acid (HA) to form the primary network and ii) thiol&#8211;ene crosslinking of norbornene-modified HA with thiolated guest&#8211;host assemblies of adamantane and &#946;-cyclodextrin to form the secondary network, is reported. The mechanical properties of the IPN hydrogels are tuned by changing the network composition, with high water content (&#8776;94%) hydrogels exhibiting excellent work of fracture, tensile strength, and low hysteresis. As proof-of-concept, the IPN hydrogels are implemented as low-viscosity Digital Light Processing resins to fabricate complex structures that recover shape upon loading, as well as in microfluidic devices to form deformable microparticles. Further, the IPNs are cytocompatible with cell adhesion dependent on the inclusion of adhesive peptides. Overall, the enhanced processing of these IPN hydrogels will expand their utility across applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Controlled Doping of Electrocatalysts through Engineering Impurities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination of ab&#160;initio calculations and atom probe tomography is used to evidence and rationalize B&#8208;doping of Pd nanocatalysts. The doping level is adjusted by controlling the wet&#8208;chemical synthesis conditions, that is, chemical potential and kinetics. Using this &#8220;impurity engineering&#8221; approach, an influence of B&#8208;doping on the electrocatalytic behavior toward the hydrogen&#8208;oxidation reaction in alkaline conditions is demonstrated.








Abstract
Fuel cells recombine water from H2 and O2 thereby can power, for example, cars or houses with no direct carbon emission. In anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs), to reach high power densities, operating at high pH is an alternative to using large volumes of noble metals catalysts at the cathode, where the oxygen&#8208;reduction reaction occurs. However, the sluggish kinetics of the hydrogen&#8208;oxidation reaction (HOR) hinders upscaling despite promising catalysts. Here, the authors observe an unexpected ingress of B into Pd nanocatalysts synthesized by wet&#8208;chemistry, gaining control over this B&#8208;doping, and report on its influence on the HOR activity in alkaline conditions. They rationalize their findings using ab&#160;initio calculations of both H&#8208; and OH&#8208;adsorption on B&#8208;doped Pd. Using this &#8220;impurity engineering&#8221; approach, they thus design Pt&#8208;free catalysts as required in electrochemical energy conversion devices, for example, next generations of AEMFCs, that satisfy the economic and environmental constraints, that is, reasonable operating costs and long&#8208;term stability, to enable the &#8220;hydrogen economy.&#8221;

         <title>Ni&#8211;Co Bimetallic Hydroxide Nanosheet Arrays Anchored on Graphene for Adsorption&#8208;Induced Enhanced Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of transition metal hydroxide NixCoy&#8211;graphene oxide (GR) composites forming porous aerogels with hierarchical nanosheet&#8208;array structure are synthesized by using a simple in situ growth method. Through doping with an appropriate amount of electron&#8208;rich Co, the Ni7Co3&#8211;GR catalyst exhibits the best photocatalytic performance due to excellent CO2 adsorption capacity, photoinduced electron/hole separation, and electron&#8208;transport efficiency.








Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction can be implemented to use CO2, a greenhouse gas, as a resource in an energy&#8208;saving and environmentally friendly way, in which suitable catalytic materials are required to achieve high&#8208;efficiency catalysis. Insufficient accessible active sites on the catalyst surface and inhibited electron transfer severely limit the photocatalytic performance. Therefore, porous aerogels are constructed from composites comprising different ratios of Ni&#8211;Co bimetallic hydroxide (NixCoy) grown on reduced graphene oxide (GR) into a hierarchical nanosheet&#8208;array structure using a facile in situ growth method. Detailed characterization shows that this structure exposes numerous active sites for enhanced adsorption&#8208;induced photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Moreover, under the synergistic effect of Ni&#8211;Co bimetallic hydroxide, the CO2 adsorption capacity as well as charge&#8208;carrier separation and transfer are excellent. As a result, the Ni7Co3&#8211;GR catalyst exhibits highly improved catalytic performance when compared with recently reported values, with a high CO release rate of 941.5&#160;&#181;mol&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;g&#8722;1 and a selectivity of 96.3% during the photocatalytic reduction of CO2. This work demonstrates a new strategy for designing nanocomposites with abundant active sites structures.

         <title>Dendrimersome Synthetic Cells Harbor Cell Division Machinery of Bacteria</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reconstitution of a rudimentary bacterial divisome in fully synthetic bicomponent dendrimersomes is shown. The interactions between this active cell machinery and the synthetic membrane are tailored by adjusting its composition. Such fine&#8208;tuning enables the reproduction of the natural dynamic behavior in a synthetic system and constitutes an important breakthrough in the assembly of synthetic cells with biological elements.








Abstract
The integration of active cell machinery with synthetic building blocks is the bridge toward developing synthetic cells with biological functions and beyond. Self&#8208;replication is one of the most important tasks of living systems, and various complex machineries exist to execute it. In Escherichia coli, a contractile division ring is positioned to mid&#8208;cell by concentration oscillations of self&#8208;organizing proteins (MinCDE), where it severs membrane and cell wall. So far, the reconstitution of any cell division machinery has exclusively been tied to liposomes. Here, the reconstitution of a rudimentary bacterial divisome in fully synthetic bicomponent dendrimersomes is shown. By tuning the membrane composition, the interaction of biological machinery with synthetic membranes can be tailored to reproduce its dynamic behavior. This constitutes an important breakthrough in the assembly of synthetic cells with biological elements, as tuning of membrane&#8211;divisome interactions is the key to engineering emergent biological behavior from the bottom&#8208;up.

         <title>Designing a Redox Heterojunction for Photocatalytic &#8220;Overall Nitrogen Fixation&#8221; under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>

In a heterojunction, interfacial charge redistribution (ICR) promotes selective accumulations of photogenerated electrons and holes in different components, realizing synchronous conversion of N2 molecules into ammonia and nitrate products&#8212;photocatalytic &#8220;overall nitrogen fixation&#8221; reactions.








Abstract
Ammonia and nitrates are the most fundamental and significant raw ingredients in human society. Till now, industrial synthetic ammonia by Haber&#8211;Bosch process and industrial synthetic nitrates by the Ostwald process have encountered increasingly serious challenges, i.e., high energy consumption, high cost, and environment&#8208;harmful gas emissions. Therefore, developing alternative approaches to achieve nitrogen fixation to overcome the inherent deficiencies of the well&#8208;established Haber&#8211;Bosch and Ostwald processes has fascinated scientists for many years, especially the simultaneous formation of ammonia and nitrate directly from N2 molecules, which has been rarely studied. Herein, a heterojunction&#8208;based photocatalytic system is designed to successfully achieve &#8220;overall nitrogen fixation,&#8221; a sustainable and simultaneous conversion of N2 molecules into ammonia and nitrate products under mild conditions. In this heterojunction, interfacial charge redistribution (ICR) promotes selective accumulations of photogenerated electrons and holes in the CdS and WO3 components. As a result, N2 molecules can be activated and reduced to ammonia products with yields of 35.8&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 by a multi&#8208;electron process, and synchronously oxidized into nitrate products with yields of 14.2&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 by a hole&#8208;induced oxidation coupling process. This work provides a novel insight and promising approach to realize artificial nitrogen fixation under mild condition.

         <title>Twisting Linear to Orbital Angular Momentum in an Ultrasonic Motor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A compact ultrasonic motor built with a meta engine block that enables high&#8208;efficiency momentum twisting and contactless rotation of sound&#8208;absorbing objects is designed and experimentally demonstrated. Without dependence on multiple sources or geometric symmetry, this passive device deeply simplifies the orbital angular momentum production in 2D acoustic systems and offers new possibilities for the miniaturization and integration of vortex devices.








Abstract
An ultrasonic motor built with a contactless meta engine block (MEB) is designed and experimentally demonstrated for twisting the linear momentum of sound emanating from a Helmholtz resonator&#8208;based metasurface into orbital angular momentum (OAM). The MEB is capable of hosting highly efficient excitations of eigenmodes carrying desired OAM whose Bessel acoustic intensity patterns are enhanced by over ten times compared to the incident wave. Thanks to this efficiency, bidirectional ultrasonic OAM is capable of driving loads at speeds up to 1000&#160;rpm at 4 W and remarkable sound radiation torque levels. Moreover, the possibility of using arbitrarily shaped MEBs is also demonstrated by engineering its physical boundary condition based on an analytically derived criterion to guarantee the high twisting efficiency of man&#8208;made OAM. The results show how noninvasive driving of an ultrasonic motor can be made possible through appropriately designed momentum twisting, which opens the door to a new class of integrated mechanical devices solely powered by sound.

         <title>A Stacked Plasmonic Metamaterial with Strong Localized Electric Field Enables Highly Efficient Broadband Light&#8208;Driven CO2 Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient light&#8208;driven catalytic CO2 hydrogenation is achieved by coupling a broadband plasmonic metamaterial absorber with a single Cu atoms based alloy as catalytic sites. The design perfectly synergizes the effects of photothermal conversion, plasmonic hot electrons, and strong localized electric field.








Abstract
Light utilization largely governs the performance of CO2 photoconversion, whereas most of the materials that are implemented in such an application are restricted in a narrow spectral absorption range. Plasmonic metamaterials with a designable regular pattern and facile tunability are excellent candidates for maximizing light absorption to generate substantial hot electrons and thermal energy. Herein, a concept of coupling a Au&#8208;based stacked plasmonic metamaterial with single Cu atoms in alloy, as light absorber and catalytic sites, respectively, is reported for gas&#8208;phase light&#8208;driven catalytic CO2 hydrogenation. The metamaterial structure works in a broad spectral range (370&#8211;1040&#160;nm) to generate high surface temperature for photothermal catalysis, and also induces strong localized electric field in favor of transfer of hot electrons and reduced energy barrier in CO2 hydrogenation. This work unravels the significant role of a strong localized electric field in photothermal catalysis and demonstrates a scalable fabrication approach to light&#8208;driven catalysts based on plasmonic metamaterials.

         <title>CO2&#8208;Induced Melting and Solvation Reconfiguration of Phase&#8208;Change Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gaseous CO2 can promote the melting and reconfigure the solvation structure of a phase&#8208;change electrolyte, thereby enhancing interactions between salt anions and Li+ cations to upgrade the solid electrolyte interphase layer. Ultimately, a Li&#8211;LiFePO4 battery with CO2&#8208;saturated electrolyte exhibits prolonged cycle life. Furthermore, a Li&#8211;CO2 battery with the baseline electrolyte can cycle stably for nearly 100 cycles at 200 mA g&#8722;1.








Abstract
Phase&#8208;change materials (PCMs) are a unique and exciting class of materials with bright prospects in wide&#8208;ranging sustainable technologies such as thermal and electrochemical energy storage. While impressive, the effect of gaseous species on PCMs remains largely unexplored hitherto. Here, a gaseous co&#8208;solvent is reported that can facilitate melting and modulate physical properties such as viscosity and ion conduction of PCMs. Especially for the appealing application of PCMs as electrolytes, gaseous species also have a critical influence on both Li+&#8208;electrolyte structure and resultant solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Specifically, theoretical simulations and experimental analysis evidence that CO2 can promote melting while reconfiguring the solvation structure of a succinonitrile (SCL)&#8208;derived Li+ phase&#8208;change electrolyte (Li+&#8208;PCE) model system. Due to the enhanced interaction between Li+ cations and bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (TFSI&#8208;) anions in the reconfigured solvation structure, more TFSI&#8208;&#8208;derived F&#8208;rich component and extra CO2&#8208;derived Li2CO3 form in the upgraded SEI layer, thereby endowing proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept Li&#8208;metal batteries with prolonged cyclability. These findings may stimulate widespread interest in gas leverage to innovate electrolyte chemistry.

         <title>Polarization Engineering of Covalent Triazine Frameworks for Highly Efficient Photosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide from Molecular Oxygen and Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
(Thio)urea&#8208;functionalized covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) are rationally designed, showing an outstanding photocatalytic activity toward production of H2O2 in water (3268.1 &#956;mol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 with a quantum yield of 8.6% at 400 nm for the thiourea&#8208;functionalized CTF) via reducing molecular oxygen (O2). This is much higher than most of the reported metal&#8208;free polymer&#8208;based photocatalysts in nonsacrificial systems.








Abstract
Two&#8208;electron oxygen photoreduction to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is seriously inhibited by its sluggish charge kinetics. Herein, a polarization engineering strategy is demonstrated by grafting (thio)urea functional groups onto covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs), giving rise to significantly promoted charge separation/transport and obviously enhanced proton transfer. The thiourea&#8208;functionalized CTF (Bpt&#8208;CTF) presents a substantial improvement in the photocatalytic H2O2 production rate to 3268.1&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 with no sacrificial agents or cocatalysts that is over an order of magnitude higher than unfunctionalized CTF (Dc&#8208;CTF), and a remarkable quantum efficiency of 8.6% at 400&#160;nm. Mechanistic studies reveal the photocatalytic performance is attributed to the prominently enhanced two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction by forming endoperoxide at the triazine unit and highly concentrated holes at the thiourea site. The generated O2 from water oxidation is subsequently consumed by the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), thereby boosting overall reaction kinetics. The findings suggest a powerful functional&#8208;groups&#8208;mediated polarization engineering method for the development of highly efficient metal&#8208;free polymer&#8208;based photocatalysts.

         <title>Dynamic Circularly Polarized Luminescence with Tunable Handedness and Intensity Enabled by Achiral Dichroic Dyes in Cholesteric Liquid Crystal Medium</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) achiral dichroic dyes, P1 and N1, are designed as anisotropic chromophores in the long and short molecular axes with chiral 1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyl derivatives in SLC1717 medium. Dynamic circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) handedness and intensity are achieved by changing the N1:P1 mass ratio, and the luminescence dissymmetry factor (gem) value reaches |0.71|.








Abstract
Cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs) are chiral supramolecular systems that self&#8208;assemble into a highly regular helical arrangement in a liquid crystal (LC) medium. Such an arrangement is highly beneficial for the chiral enlargement effect on circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) signals. Dichroic dyes with rod&#8208;like molecular structures can exhibit fluorescence anisotropy along both the long and short molecular axes owing to their transition dipole moment (TDM) vectors. In this work, a pair of donor&#8211;accepter (D&#8211;A) achiral dichroic dyes is prepared, namely, 3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene derivative (P1, whose TDM vector is parallel to the long axis of the molecule, i.e., F||&#160;&gt; F&#8869;) and anthraquinone derivative (N1, whose TDM vector is perpendicular to the long axis of the molecule, i.e., F||&#160;&lt; F&#8869;). CLCs can be fabricated by doping P1 or N1 together with chiral 1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyl&#8208;derived inducers into SLC1717 medium. Dynamic CPL with tunable handedness and intensity is achieved by changing the N1:P1 mass ratio, and the luminescence dissymmetry factor (gem) value reaches |0.71|. This work describes the first observation of dynamic CPL with tunable handedness and intensity enabled by TDM regulation of achiral dichroic dyes in a CLC medium.

         <title>Inhibition and Reconstruction of Zener Tunneling in Photonic Honeycomb Lattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A precise site&#8208;dependent photonic material has the ability of modifying momentum&#8208;space properties and maintaining the coherence of bulk states in transport. Artificial honeycomb lattices with an effective force are constructed to realize highly controllable Zener tunneling and the coherence protection of particles transmitting on artificial quantum materials.








Abstract
Quantum coherence is the central element of particle states, and it characterizes the overall performance of various quantum materials. Bloch oscillation is a fundamental coherent behavior of particles under a static potential, which can be easily destroyed by Zener tunneling in multiband 2D lattice materials. The control of Zener tunneling therefore plays the key role in quantum engineering for complicated physical systems. Here, the inhibition and reconstruction of Zener tunneling in photonic honeycomb lattices are experimentally demonstrated. &#160;Deformed honeycomb lattices are integrated and an effective static potential is realized on the 2D lattice materials. Zener tunneling disappears in stretch&#8208;type lattices and wave packets stay in the dispersionless upper energy band. On the contrary, Zener tunneling is greatly enhanced in compression&#8208;type lattices and wave packets exhibit directional oscillations without branches, which manifest the preserved coherence of the wave packets. The results demonstrate the protection of photonic coherence by structurally controlling the Zener tunneling, representing a step toward flexible quantum engineering for large&#8208;scale artificial quantum&#160;materials.

         <title>Cellulose Nanocrystal Aqueous Colloidal Suspensions: Evidence of Density Inversion at the Isotropic&#8208;Liquid Crystal Phase Transition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new low&#8208;density liquid crystalline (LC) phase in aqueous colloidal suspensions of rod&#8208;like cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) is demonstrated. This behavior is an indication that the LC phase is an indirect way to reveal CNCs/water interactions. The scale bar in the image is 100&#160;&#181;m.








Abstract
The colloidal suspensions of aqueous cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) are known to form liquid crystalline (LC) systems above certain critical concentrations. From an isotropic phase, tactoid formation, growth, and sedimentation have been determined as the genesis of a high&#8208;density cholesteric phase, which, after drying, originates solid iridescent films. Herein, the coexistence of a liquid crystal upper phase and an isotropic bottom phase in CNC aqueous suspensions at the isotropic&#8211;nematic phase separation is reported. Furthermore, isotropic spindle&#8208;like domains are observed in the low&#8208;density LC phase and high&#8208;density LC phases are also prepared. The CNCs isolated from the low&#8208; and high&#8208;density LC phases are found to have similar average lengths, diameters, and surface charges. The existence of an LC low&#8208;density phase is explained by the presence of air dissolved in the water present within the CNCs. The air dissolves out when the water solidifies into ice and remains within the CNCs. The self&#8208;adjustment of the cellulose chain conformation enables the entrapment of air within the CNCs and CNC buoyancy in aqueous suspensions.

         <title>Slip&#8208;Line&#8208;Guided Growth of Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Slip lines on metal surfaces are found to play a pivotal role in determining the orientation of graphene. The slip&#8208;line&#8208;guided growth principle is established to explain and predict the orientation of graphene grown on a variety of metal facets, further enabling the controllable synthesis of single&#8208;crystal graphene and grain&#8208;boundary engineering of bicrystal graphene on designed metal facets.








Abstract
Manipulating the crystal orientation of emerging 2D materials via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is a key premise for obtaining single&#8208;crystalline films and designing specific grain&#8208;boundary (GB) structures. Herein, the controllable crystal orientation of graphene during the CVD process is demonstrated on a single&#8208;crystal metal surface with preexisting atomic&#8208;scale stair steps resulting from dislocation slip lines. The slip&#8208;line&#8208;guided growth principle is established to explain and predict the crystal orientation distribution of graphene on a variety of metal facets, especially for the multidirectional growth cases on Cu(hk0) and Cu(hkl) substrates. Not only large&#8208;area single&#8208;crystal graphene, but also bicrystal graphene with controllable GB misorientations, are successfully synthesized by rationally employing tailored metal substrate facets. As a demonstration, bicrystal graphenes with misorientations of &#8776;21&#176; and &#8776;11&#176; are constructed on Cu(410) and Cu(430) foils, respectively. This guideline builds a bridge linking the crystal orientation of graphene and the substrate facet, thereby opening a new avenue for constructing bicrystals with the desired GB structures or manipulating 2D superlattice twist angles in a bottom&#8208;up manner.

         <title>Enhanced Dual&#8208;Directional Sulfur Redox via a Biotemplated Single&#8208;Atomic Fe&#8211;N2 Mediator Promises Durable Li&#8211;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An Fe&#8211;N2 single&#8208;atomic catalyst accommodated by a biomorphic hierarchical C3N4 support from a biomass template readily boosts the dual&#8208;directional conversion kinetics of lithium sulfide and realizes high&#8208;performance Li&#8722;S batteries.








Abstract
The lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) battery is considered as an appealing candidate for next&#8208;generation electrochemical energy storage systems because of high energy and low cost. Nonetheless, its development is plagued by the severe polysulfide shuttling and sluggish reaction kinetics. Although single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have emerged as a promising remedy to expedite sulfur redox chemistry, the mediocre single&#8208;atom loading, inferior atomic utilization, and elusive catalytic pathway handicap their practical application. To tackle these concerns, in this work, unsaturated Fe single atoms with high loading capacity (&#8776;6.32 wt%) are crafted on a 3D hierarchical C3N4 architecture (3DFeSA&#8208;CN) by means of biotemplated synthesis. By electrokinetic analysis and theoretical calculations, it is uncovered that the 3DFeSA&#8208;CN harnesses robust electrocatalytic activity to boost dual&#8208;directional sulfur redox. As a result, S@3DFeSA&#8208;CN can maintain a durable cyclic performance with a negligible capacity decay rate of 0.031% per cycle over 2000 cycles at 1.0 C. More encouragingly, an assembled Li&#8211;S battery with a sulfur loading of 5.75&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 can harvest a high areal capacity of 6.18 mAh cm&#8722;2. This work offers a promising solution to optimize the carbonaceous support and coordination environment of SACs, thereby ultimately elevating dual&#8208;directional sulfur redox in pragmatic Li&#8211;S batteries.

&lt;p&gt;An Fe&#8211;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; single-atomic catalyst accommodated by a biomorphic hierarchical C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; support from a biomass template readily boosts the dual-directional conversion kinetics of lithium sulfide and realizes high-performance Li&#8722;S batteries.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) battery is considered as an appealing candidate for next-generation electrochemical energy storage systems because of high energy and low cost. Nonetheless, its development is plagued by the severe polysulfide shuttling and sluggish reaction kinetics. Although single-atom catalysts (SACs) have emerged as a promising remedy to expedite sulfur redox chemistry, the mediocre single-atom loading, inferior atomic utilization, and elusive catalytic pathway handicap their practical application. To tackle these concerns, in this work, unsaturated Fe single atoms with high loading capacity (&#8776;6.32 wt%) are crafted on a 3D hierarchical C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; architecture (3DFeSA-CN) by means of biotemplated synthesis. By electrokinetic analysis and theoretical calculations, it is uncovered that the 3DFeSA-CN harnesses robust electrocatalytic activity to boost dual-directional sulfur redox. As a result, S@3DFeSA-CN can maintain a durable cyclic performance with a negligible capacity decay rate of 0.031% per cycle over 2000 cycles at 1.0 C. More encouragingly, an assembled Li&#8211;S battery with a sulfur loading of 5.75&#160;mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; can harvest a high areal capacity of 6.18 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This work offers a promising solution to optimize the carbonaceous support and coordination environment of SACs, thereby ultimately elevating dual-directional sulfur redox in pragmatic Li&#8211;S batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Activatable Cancer Sono&#8208;Immunotherapy using Semiconducting Polymer Nanobodies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An activatable organic nanobody (SPNAb) is developed for cancer sono&#8208;immunotherapy. Ultrasound irradiation of SPNAb can not only induce immunogenic cell death by sonodynamic therapy but also activate anti&#8208;CTLA4 antibodies to in situ trigger checkpoint blockade, resulting in enhanced systemic antitumor immunity.








Abstract
Despite the great promises of sonodynamic therapy (SDT) in combination cancer therapy, its clinical applications are hindered by the &#8220;always&#8208;on&#8221; pharmacological activities of therapeutic agents and the lack of efficient sonosensitizers. Herein, the development of semiconducting polymers as efficient sonosensitizers and further development of sono&#8208;immunotherapeutic nanobodies (SPNAb) for activatable cancer sono&#8208;immunotherapy are reported. Conjugation of anti&#8208;CTLA&#8208;4 antibodies onto the polymer nanoparticles through a 1O2&#8208;cleavable linker affords SPNAb with relatively low CTLA&#8208;4 binding affinity. Upon sono&#8208;irradiation, SPNAb generates 1O2 not only to elicit a sonodynamic effect to induce immunogenic cell death, but also to release anti&#8208;CTLA&#8208;4 antibodies and trigger in situ checkpoint blockade. Such a synergistic therapeutic action mediated by SPNAb modulates the tumoricidal function of T&#8208;cell immunity by promoting the proliferation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and depleting immunosuppressive regulatory T cells, resulting in effective tumor regression, metastasis inhibition, durable immunological memory, and prevention of relapse. Therefore, this study represents a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept sonodynamic strategy using semiconducting polymers for precise spatiotemporal control over immunotherapy.

         <title>A High&#8208;Energy and Safe Lithium Battery Enabled by Solid&#8208;State Redox Chemistry in a Fireproof Gel Electrolyte</title>

Solid&#8208;state redox chemistry of a molecular Li2S cathode and Si anode in a fireproof gel electrolyte enables a high&#8208;energy quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium battery with long life, good temperature adaptability, negligible self&#8208;discharge, and remarkable safety against extreme abuse in the air, water, or even on fire.








Abstract
Recent years have witnessed thriving efforts in pursuing high&#8208;energy batteries at an unaffordable cost of safety. Herein, a high&#8208;energy and safe quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium battery is proposed by solid&#8208;state redox chemistry of polymer&#8208;based molecular Li2S cathode in a fireproof gel electrolyte. This chemistry fully eliminates not only the negative effect of extremely reactive Li metal and oxygen species on cell safety but also the damage of electrode reversibility by soluble redox intermediates. The molecular Li2S cathode exhibits an exceptional lifetime of 2000 cycles, 100% Coulombic efficiency, high capacity of 830 mA&#160;h g&#8722;1 with ultralow capacity loss of 0.005&#8211;0.01% per cycle and superior rate capability up to 10 C. Meanwhile, it shows high stability in the carbonate&#8208;involving electrolyte for maximizing the compatibility with carbonate&#8208;efficient Si anode. The optimized cell chemistry exerts high energy over 750&#160;W&#160;h kg&#8722;1 for 500 cycles with fast rate response, high&#8208;temperature adaptability, and no self&#8208;discharge. A fire&#8208;retardant composite gel electrolyte is developed to further strengthen the intrinsic safe redox between the Li2S cathode and the Si anode, which secures remarkable safety against extreme abuse of overheating, short circuits, and mechanical damage in air/water or even when on fire.

         <title>Achieving Ultrahigh&#8208;Rate Planar and Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc Electroplating for Aqueous Zinc Battery Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zinc&#8208;metal anodes, which are desirable for various aqueous zinc battery chemistries, degrade over repeated cycling due to dendrite growth. It is found that dendrites can be prevented by ensuring no defective regions form during zinc deposition, thus removing sites for dendrite nucleation and ensuring purely planar deposition. This allows unprecedentedly high charging rates to be achieved.








Abstract
Despite being one of the most promising candidates for grid&#8208;level energy storage, practical aqueous zinc batteries are limited by dendrite formation, which leads to significantly compromised safety and cycling performance. In this study, by using single&#8208;crystal Zn&#8208;metal anodes, reversible electrodeposition of planar Zn with a high capacity of 8 mAh cm&#8722;2 can be achieved at an unprecedentedly high current density of 200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. This dendrite&#8208;free electrode is well maintained even after prolonged cycling (&gt;1200 cycles at 50 mA cm&#8722;2). Such excellent electrochemical performance is due to single&#8208;crystal Zn suppressing the major sources of defect generation during electroplating and heavily favoring planar deposition morphologies. As so few defect sites form, including those that would normally be found along grain boundaries or to accommodate lattice mismatch, there is little opportunity for dendritic structures to nucleate, even under extreme plating rates. This scarcity of defects is in part due to perfect atomic&#8208;stitching between merging Zn islands, ensuring no defective shallow&#8208;angle grain boundaries are formed and thus removing a significant source of non&#8208;planar Zn nucleation. It is demonstrated that an ideal high&#8208;rate Zn anode should offer perfect lattice matching as this facilitates planar epitaxial Zn growth and minimizes the formation of any defective regions.

         <title>Integrating Bi@C Nanospheres in Porous Hard Carbon Frameworks for Ultrafast Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel 3D carbon framework superstructure assembled with carbon nanobelt arrays decorated with metallic bismuth (Bi) nanospheres wrapped by a carbon layer (Bi@C&#8834;CFs) is synthesized via thermolysis of Bi&#8208;based metal&#8722;organic framework nanorods. Due to this novel and unique architecture design, the hybrid electrode indicates superior electrochemical performance as an anode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) have emerged as an alternative technology because of their merits in abundance and cost. Realizing their real applications, however, remains a formidable challenge. One is that among the limitations of anode materials, the alloy&#8208;type candidates tolerate fast capacity fading during cycling. Here, a 3D framework superstructure assembled with carbon nanobelt arrays decorated with a metallic bismuth (Bi) nanospheres coated carbon layer by thermolysis of Bi&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework nanorods is synthesized as an anode material for SIBs. Due to the unique structural superiority, the anode design promotes excellent sodium&#8208;storage performance in terms of high capacity, excellent cycling stability, and ultrahigh rate capability up to 80&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 with a capacity of 308.8&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1. The unprecedented sodium&#8208;storage ability is not only attributed to the unique hybrid architecture, but also to the production of a homogeneous and thin solid electrolyte interface layer and the formation of uniform porous nanostructures during cycling in the ether&#8208;based electrolyte. Importantly, deeper understanding of the underlying cause of the performance improvement is illuminated, which is vital to provide the theoretical basis for application of SIBs.

Due to the unique structural superiority, the anode design promotes excellent sodium-storage performance in terms of high capacity, excellent cycling stability, and ultrahigh rate capability up to 80&#160;A&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with a capacity of 308.8&#160;mAh&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The unprecedented sodium-storage ability is not only attributed to the unique hybrid architecture, but also to the production of a homogeneous and thin solid electrolyte interface layer and the formation of uniform porous nanostructures during cycling in the ether-based electrolyte. Importantly, deeper understanding of the underlying cause of the performance improvement is illuminated, which is vital to provide the theoretical basis for application of SIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Microstructured Hydrogels to Guide Self&#8208;Assembly and Function of Lung Alveolospheres</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Epithelial cell organoids provide a system to probe tissue development and disease in vitro and for cell transplantation. Within the lung field, alveolar organoids almost exclusively depend on Matrigel, which limits defined culture conditions. In this work, the design of an accessible hydrogel system with predefined microcavities to generate alveolar organoids through self&#8208;assembly and maintenance of progenitor cell fate and function is described.








Abstract
Epithelial cell organoids have increased opportunities to probe questions on tissue development and disease in vitro and for therapeutic cell transplantation. Despite their potential, current protocols to grow these organoids almost exclusively depend on culture within 3D Matrigel, which limits defined culture conditions, introduces animal components, and results in heterogenous organoids (i.e., shape, size, composition). Here, a method is described that relies on hyaluronic acid hydrogels for the generation and expansion of lung alveolar organoids (alveolospheres). Using synthetic hydrogels with defined chemical and physical properties, human&#8208;induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)&#8208;derived alveolar type 2 cells (iAT2s) self&#8208;assemble into alveolospheres and propagate in Matrigel&#8208;free conditions. By engineering predefined microcavities within these hydrogels, the heterogeneity of alveolosphere size and structure is reduced when compared to 3D culture, while maintaining the alveolar type 2 cell fate of human iAT2&#8208;derived progenitor cells. This hydrogel system is a facile and accessible system for the culture of iPSC&#8208;derived lung progenitors and the method can be expanded to the culture of primary mouse tissue derived AT2 and other epithelial progenitor and stem cell aggregates.

         <title>A Print&#8208;and&#8208;Fuse Strategy for Sacrificial Filaments Enables Biomimetically Structured Perfusable Microvascular Networks with Functional Endothelium Inside 3D Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Melt electrowriting&#8208;printed thermoresponsive poly(2&#8208;cyclopropyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline) scaffolds with biomimetic geometry are integrated into customized microscopy&#8208;compliant bioreactor. Filling of the bioreactor with a hydrogel precursor solution induces fusion of adjacent filaments in the scaffolds (print&#8208;and&#8208;fuse approach). Subsequent temperature decrease below the lower critical solution temperature produces perfusable microchannels with circular cross&#8208;sections, biomimetic volume&#8208;ratio between mother and daughter channels, and leakage&#8208;free fluid connection that enable rapid endothelialization.








Abstract
A facile and flexible approach for the integration of biomimetically branched microvasculature within bulk hydrogels is presented. For this, sacrificial scaffolds of thermoresponsive poly(2&#8208;cyclopropyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline) (PcycloPrOx) are created using melt electrowriting (MEW) in an optimized and predictable way and subsequently placed into a customized bioreactor system, which is then filled with a hydrogel precursor solution. The aqueous environment above the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of PcycloPrOx at 25&#160;&#176;C swells the polymer without dissolving it, resulting in fusion of filaments that are deposited onto each other (print&#8208;and&#8208;fuse approach). Accordingly, an adequate printing pathway design results in generating physiological&#8208;like branchings and channel volumes that approximate Murray's law in the geometrical ratio between parent and daughter vessels. After gel formation, a temperature decrease below the LCST produces interconnected microchannels with distinct inlet and outlet regions. Initial placement of the sacrificial scaffolds in the bioreactors in a pre&#8208;defined manner directly yields perfusable structures via leakage&#8208;free fluid connections in a reproducible one&#8208;step procedure. Using this approach, rapid formation of a tight and biologically functional endothelial layer, as assessed not only through fluorescent dye diffusion, but also by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF&#8208;&#945;) stimulation, is obtained within three days.

         <title>Intrinsically High Magnetic Performance in Core&#8211;Shell Structural (Sm,Y)Fe12&#8208;Based Permanent Magnets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction of core&#8211;shell structure (Sm&#8208;rich shell and Y&#8208;rich core) in (Sm,Y)Fe12&#8208;based magnet is demonstrated via a spontaneous spinodal decomposition process, resulting in the relatively high anisotropy field of 9.24 T in the optimized alloy. It provides an innovative strategy and has important significance for the design of high&#8208;performance magnets.








Abstract
ThMn12&#8208;type SmFe12&#8208;based permanent magnets have exhibited great potential in advanced magnet motors because of their high temperature stability of magnetic properties. However, the applications could be seriously limited due to the trade&#8208;off between phase stability and intrinsic magnetic properties. In this work, an effective solution is demonstrated by constructing the core&#8211;shell structure (Sm&#8208;rich shell and Y&#8208;rich core) via a spontaneous spinodal decomposition process. The anisotropy field for the (Sm0.75Y0.25)(Fe0.8Co0.2)11.25Ti0.75 alloy is mostly optimized to be 9.24 T at room temperature. Such an enhancement is ascribed to the pinning process of domain walls by the magnetic&#8208;hardening Sm&#8208;rich shell, which is directly observed by in situ Lorentz transmission electron microscopy and reconstructed by micromagnetic simulation. Moreover, the phase stability and saturation magnetization are simultaneously increased, which is attributed to the synergistic effect of Y, Co, and Ti substitutions. More importantly, the high &#956;0Ms value of 1.52 T is comparable to the reported (Sm,Zr)Fe12&#8208;based bulk alloys that contain a larger amount of soft &#945;&#8208;Fe phases, indicating that this strategy is more promising toward bulk magnets. The present study provides a significant concept for the development of advanced permanent magnets and also has implications for understanding the structural origin of intrinsic magnetic configurations.

         <title>Enhancing Transition Dipole Moments of Heterocyclic Semiconductors via Rational Nitrogen&#8208;Substitution for Sensitive Near Infrared Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]thieno[2,3&#8208;d]pyrrole heterocyclic semiconductors with stretched geometry show enhanced transition dipole moments, leading to large absorption coefficients of up to 4.3 &#215; 105 cm&#8722;1 beyond 900&#160;nm in thin films. The self&#8208;powered organic photodetectors in this work show high detectivity (1012 to 2.2 &#215; 1013 Jones) over a broad spectrum of 310&#8211;1010&#160;nm, comparable with some commercial inorganic photodetectors.








Abstract
Designing ultrastrong near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorbing organic semiconductors is a critical prerequisite for sensitive NIR thin film organic photodetectors (OPDs), especially in the region of beyond 900&#160;nm, where the absorption coefficient of commercial single crystalline silicon (c&#8208;Si) is below 103 cm&#8722;1. Herein, a pyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]thieno[2,3&#8208;d]pyrrole heterocyclic core (named as BPPT) with strong electron&#8208;donating property and stretched geometry is developed. Relative to their analogue Y6, BPPT&#8208;contained molecules, BPPT&#8208;4F and BPPT&#8208;4Cl, show substantially upshifted and more delocalized highest occupied molecular orbitals, and larger transition dipole moments, leading to bathochromic and hyperchromic absorption spectra extending beyond 1000&#160;nm with very large absorption coefficients (up to 3.7&#8211;4.3 &#215; 105 cm&#8722;1) as thin films. These values are much higher than those (104 to 1 &#215; 105 cm&#8722;1) of typical organic semiconductors, and 1&#8211;2 orders higher than those of commercial inorganic materials, such as c&#8208;Si, Ge, and InGaAs. The OPDs based on BPPT&#8208;4F or BPPT&#8208;4Cl blending polymer PBDB&#8208;T show high detectivity of above 1012 Jones in a wide wavelength range of 310&#8211;1010&#160;nm with excellent peak values of 1.3&#8211;2.2 &#215; 1013 Jones, respectively, which are comparable with and even better than those commercial inorganic photodetectors.

Herein, a pyrrolo[3,2-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;]thieno[2,3-&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;]pyrrole heterocyclic core (named as BPPT) with strong electron-donating property and stretched geometry is developed. Relative to their analogue Y6, BPPT-contained molecules, BPPT-4F and BPPT-4Cl, show substantially upshifted and more delocalized highest occupied molecular orbitals, and larger transition dipole moments, leading to bathochromic and hyperchromic absorption spectra extending beyond 1000&#160;nm with very large absorption coefficients (up to 3.7&#8211;4.3 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) as thin films. These values are much higher than those (10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; to 1 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) of typical organic semiconductors, and 1&#8211;2 orders higher than those of commercial inorganic materials, such as c-Si, Ge, and InGaAs. The OPDs based on BPPT-4F or BPPT-4Cl blending polymer PBDB-T show high detectivity of above 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; Jones in a wide wavelength range of 310&#8211;1010&#160;nm with excellent peak values of 1.3&#8211;2.2 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; Jones, respectively, which are comparable with and even better than those commercial inorganic photodetectors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tailoring Oxygen Reduction Reaction Pathway on Spinel Oxides via Surficial Geometrical&#8208;Site Occupation Modification Driven by the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is crucial for both energy conversion technologies and hydrogen peroxide intermediate production, which proceeds via four&#8208;electron or two&#8208;electron pathways, respectively. Special electrocatalysts to promote either the 4e&#8722; or the 2e&#8722; reaction route are important. The surficial metals occupation of partially inverse MnCo2O4 can be tuned to realize this reaction mechanism switching.








Abstract
The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has been demonstrated as a critical technology for both energy conversion technologies and hydrogen peroxide intermediate production. Herein, an in situ oxygen evolution reaction (OER) surface evolution strategy is applied for changing the surface structure of MnCo2O4 oxide with tetrahedral and octahedral cations vacancies to realize reaction pathway switching from 2e&#8722; ORR and 4e&#8722; ORR. Interestingly, the as&#8208;synthesized MnCo2O4&#8208;pristine (MnCo2O4&#8208;P) with the highest surficial Mn/Co octahedron occupation favors two electrons reaction routes exhibiting high H2O2 selectivity (&#8776;80% and reaches nearly 100% at 0.75&#160;V vs RHE); after surface atoms reconstruction, MnCo2O4&#8208;activation (MnCo2O4&#8208;A) with the largest Mn/Co tetrahedron occupation present excellent ORR performance through the four&#8208;electron pathway with an ultrahigh onset potential and half&#8208;wave potential of 0.78 and 0.92&#160;V, ideal mass activity (MA), and turnover frequencies (TOF) values. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the concurrent modulations of both Co and Mn by the surface reconstructions, which improve the electroactivity of MnCo2O4&#8208;A toward the 4e&#8722; pathway. This work provides a new perspective to building correlation of OER activation&#8211;ORR property, bringing detailed understating for reaction route transformation, and thus guiding the development of certain electrocatalysts with specific purposes.

         <title>Unusual Mesoporous Titanium Niobium Oxides Realizing Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries Operated at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unusual mesoporous titanium niobium oxides@carbon (Ti0.88Nb0.88O4&#8722;x@C) with large pore sizes and highly crystallized nanocrystals embedded in carbon frameworks are synthesized via a confined acid&#8211;base pair self&#8208;assembly strategy. As an anode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries, the mesoporous Ti0.88Nb0.88O4&#8722;x@C shows exceptional performances at room temperature and even at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) are a promising candidate for grid&#8208;scale energy storage, however, the sluggish ion&#8208;diffusion kinetics brought by the large radius of Na+ seriously limits the performance of SIBs, let alone at low temperatures. Herein, a confined acid&#8211;base pair self&#8208;assembly strategy to synthesize unusual Ti0.88Nb0.88O4&#8722;x@C for high&#8208;performance SIBs operating at room and low temperatures is proposed. The confinement self&#8208;assembly of the acid&#8211;base pair around the micelles and confined crystallization by the carbon layer realize the formation of ordered and stoichiometric mesoporous frameworks with opened ion channels. Thus, the mesoporous Ti0.88Nb0.88O4&#8722;x@C exhibits rapid Na+ diffusion kinetics at 25 and &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C, which are one order higher than that of the nonporous one. A high reversible capacity of 233 mAh g&#8722;1, excellent rate (a specific capacity of 103 mAh g&#8722;1 at 50 C), and cycling performances (&lt;0.03% fading per cycle) can be observed at 25&#160;&#176;C. More importantly, even at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C, the mesoporous Ti0.88Nb0.88O4&#8211;x@C can still deliver the 161 mAh g&#8722;1 capacity, a high initial Coulombic efficiency of 60% and outstanding cycling stability (99 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 C after 500 cycles). It is believed this strategy opens a new avenue for constructing novel mesoporous electrode materials for low&#8208;temperature energy storage.

         <title>Recyclable, Healable, and Tough Ionogels Insensitive to Crack Propagation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Irreversible covalent crosslinking in the matrix polymer network is avoided. The reversible entangled microdomains of the microspheres and linear segments in tough ionogels act as elastic physical crosslinking points to provide mechanical stability, dissipate stress concentration, and prevent crack propagation in any load direction. The entangled networks can be disentangled to restore the damaged mechanical properties and realize recycling.








Abstract
Most gels and elastomers introduce sacrificial bonds in the covalent network to dissipate energy. However, long&#8208;term cyclic loading caused irreversible fatigue damage and crack propagation cannot be prevented. Furthermore, because of the irreversible covalent crosslinked networks, it is a huge challenge to implement reversible mechanical interlocking and reorganize the polymer segments to realize the recycling and reuse of ionogels. Here, covalent crosslinking of host materials is replaced with entanglement. The entangled microdomains are used as physical crosslinking while introducing reversible bond interactions. The interpenetrating, entangled, and elastic microdomains of linear segments and covalent&#8208;network microspheres provide mechanical stability, eliminate stress concentration at the crack tip under load, and achieve unprecedented tear and fatigue resistance of ionogels in any load direction. Moreover, reversible entanglements and noncovalent interactions can be disentangled and recombined to achieve recycling and mechanical regeneration, and the recyclability of covalent&#8208;network microdomains is realized.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance organic solar modules by blade coating are developed via a bilayer&#8208;merged&#8208;annealing strategy, achieving impressive power conversion efficiency of 14.79% with an active area of 18.73 cm2, which represents the best organic solar minimodule by blade coating so far.








Abstract
Although encouraging progress is being made on spin&#8208;coated prototype cells, organic solar cells (OSCs) still face significant challenges, yet to be explored, for upscaling the multi&#8208;stacked photoactive layers in the construction of large&#8208;area modules. Herein, high&#8208;performance opaque and semitransparent organic solar modules are developed via a bilayer&#8208;merged&#8208;annealing (BMA)&#8208;assisted blade&#8208;coating strategy, achieving impressive efficiencies of 14.79% and 12.01% with respect to active area of 18.73 cm2, which represent the best organic solar minimodules so far. It is revealed that the BMA strategy effectively resolves the de&#8208;wetting issues between polar charge transport layer solution and non&#8208;polar bulk heterojunction blends, hence improving the film coverage, along with electronic and electric contacts of multi&#8208;stacked photoactive layers. As result, organic solar modules coated under ambient conditions successfully retain the high&#8208;efficiency of small&#8208;area cells upon 312 times area scaling&#8208;up. Overall, this work provides a facile and effective method to fabricate high&#8208;performance organic solar modules under ambient conditions.

         <title>Energy Conversion Analysis of Multilayered Triboelectric Nanogenerators for Synergistic Rain and Solar Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance instantaneous triboelectric nanogenerator (I&#8208;TENG) and a quantitative analysis method named &#8220;kinetic energy calculation and current integration&#8221; (KECCI) are developed to promote the understanding of energy flows and working principles of TENGs in&#8208;depth. Furthermore, multi&#8208;layered TENGs are integrated with organic photovoltaics to work synergistically. This work guides the further development of TENG and promotes its commercialization process.








Abstract
The triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is an emerging technology that offers excellent potential for the conversion of mechanical energy from rain into electricity for hybrid energy applications. However, a high&#8208;performance TENG is yet to be achieved because a quantitative analysis method for the energy conversion process is still lacking. Herein, a quantitative analysis method, termed the "kinetic energy calculation and current integration" (KECCI) method, which significantly improves the understanding of the mechanical&#8208;to&#8208;electrical energy conversion process, is presented. Based on the KECCI method, a high&#8208;performance TENG is developed by systematically optimizing a biomimetic surface structure and instant switch design, with 1.25&#160;mA short&#8208;circuit current (Isc), 150&#160;V open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc), and a high energy&#8208;conversion efficiency of 24.89%. Furthermore, a multilayered TENG device is proposed for continuously harvesting the kinetic energy of raindrops for further improvement in the energy&#8208;conversion efficiency. Finally, the multilayered TENGs are integrated with organic photovoltaics, achieving all&#8208;weather energy harvesting. This work presents a validated theoretical basis that will guide further development of TENGs toward higher performances, which will promote the commercialization of hybrid TENG systems for all&#8208;weather applications.

Acoustic Meta&#8208;Engine
In article number 2201575, Bin Liang, Jian&#8208;Chun Cheng, Johan Christensen, and co&#8208;workers report a metasurface&#8208;inspired compact motor that is capable of converting linear to angular momentum for audible and ultrasonic waves. With speed of up to 1000 rpm, noninvasive driving is made possible through appropriately designed momentum twisting, which opens the door to a new class of integrated mechanical devices solely powered by sound.

Bacterial Cell Division
In article number 2202364, Petra Schwille, Cesar Rodriguez&#8208;Emmenegger, and co&#8208;workers show the reconstitution of a bacterial divisome in fully synthetic dendrimersomes. The fine&#8208;tuning of interactions between the active cell machinery and synthetic membrane enables the reproduction of the natural dynamic behavior in a synthetic system. This constitutes a breakthrough in the assembly of synthetic cells as tuning of membrane&#8211;divisome interactions is the key to engineering biological behavior and beyond.

Zener Tunneling
In article number 2110044, Xian&#8208;Min Jin and co&#8208;workers report the realization of highly controllable Zener tunneling for protecting photonic coherence. The excited photonic states flow collectively along the energy band due to almost&#8208;total Zener tunneling, below which the excited states on the lattice materials undergo a directionally oscillating trajectory, directly associated with the above energy band. These results represent a step toward flexible quantum engineering for large&#8208;scale artificial quantum materials.

Cellulose Nanocrystals
Rod&#8208;like cellulose nanocrystal aqueous colloidal suspensions can be prepared from eucalyptus kraft pulp. In article number 2108227, Maria Helena Godinho and co&#8208;workers show the formation of a liquid crystalline (LC) phase atop an isotropic phase, inverted from the typical high&#8208;density LC phase. The bounciness of the particles is attributed to the presence of air. The behavior observed is an indication that the LC phase is an indirect way to reveal cellulose nanocrystal/water interactions.

         <title>Host&#8211;Guest Intercalation Chemistry for the Synthesis and Modification of Two&#8208;Dimensional Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intercalation chemistry is extensively investigated to synthesize and modulate 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) with atomic thickness due to the diverse host&#8211;guest configurations and impact in their layered framework. Recent advances regarding 2D TMD materials, through intercalation exfoliation, from the views of host, guest, and solvent, are reviewed.








Abstract
Intercalation chemistry is of great importance in solid&#8208;state physics and chemistry for the ability to modulate electronic structures for constructing new materials with exotic properties. This ancient and versatile discipline has recently become prevailing in the synthesis and regulation of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) with atomic thickness due to diverse host&#8211;guest configurations and their impact on layered frameworks, which bring in extensive applications in electronics, optoelectronics, and other energy&#8208;based devices. In order to prepare 2D TMD materials with desired structure and properties, it is essential to gain in&#8208;depth understanding of the key role the intercalation chemistry plays in the preparation process. A focused review on recent advances regarding 2D TMD materials through intercalation exfoliation from the view of host, guest, and solvent interactions is provided. The effect of intercalation chemistry on TMD nanosheets synthesis and modification is comprehensively reviewed. The interactions between host and guest from the aspects of lattice strain, interlayer distance, and carrier density are considered. Finally, a prospectus of the future research opportunities for the intercalation chemistry of 2D materials is provided.

         <title>Direct Ink Writing: A 3D Printing Technology for Diverse Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The comprehensive review comprises recent development in direct&#8208;ink&#8208;writing (DIW) 3D printing technology for the development of 3D structures from various materials such as polymers, ceramics, glass, cement, graphene, metals, and multimaterials. The work describes the fundamentals and engineering of ink rheology required for DIW. In addition, a multitude of applications, current challenges, and future prospects of the technology are discussed.








Abstract
Additive manufacturing (AM) has gained significant attention due to its ability to drive technological development as a sustainable, flexible, and customizable manufacturing scheme. Among the various AM techniques, direct ink writing (DIW) has emerged as the most versatile 3D printing technique for the broadest range of materials. DIW allows printing of practically any material, as long as the precursor ink can be engineered to demonstrate appropriate rheological behavior. This technique acts as a unique pathway to introduce design freedom, multifunctionality, and stability simultaneously into its printed structures. Here, a comprehensive review of DIW of complex 3D structures from various materials, including polymers, ceramics, glass, cement, graphene, metals, and their combinations through multimaterial printing is presented. The review begins with an overview of the fundamentals of ink rheology, followed by an in&#8208;depth discussion of the various methods to tailor the ink for DIW of different classes of materials. Then, the diverse applications of DIW ranging from electronics to food to biomedical industries are discussed. Finally, the current challenges and limitations of this technique are highlighted, followed by its prospects as&#160;a&#160;guideline toward possible futuristic innovations.

         <title>Application of Nanostructured TiO2 in UV Photodetectors: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanostructured TiO2 application in UV photodetectors is been comprehensively reviewed. More importantly, an in&#8208;depth illustration of optoelectronic properties and technological issues is discussed in detail. This review provides a roadmap for material design and functional application for high&#8208;performance optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
As a wide&#8208;bandgap semiconductor material, titanium dioxide (TiO2), which possesses three crystal polymorphs (i.e., rutile, anatase, and brookite), has gained tremendous attention as a cutting&#8208;edge material for application in the environment and energy fields. Based on the strong attractiveness from its advantages such as high stability, excellent photoelectric properties, and low&#8208;cost fabrication, the construction of high&#8208;performance photodetectors (PDs) based on TiO2 nanostructures is being extensively developed. An elaborate microtopography and device configuration is the most widely used strategy to achieve efficient TiO2&#8208;based PDs with high photoelectric performances; however, a deep understanding of all the key parameters that influence the behavior of photon&#8208;generated carriers, is also highly required to achieve improved photoelectric performances, as well as their ultimate functional applications. Herein, an in&#8208;depth illustration of the electrical and optical properties of TiO2 nanostructures in addition to the advances in the technological issues such as preparation, microdefects, p&#8208;type doping, bandgap engineering, heterojunctions, and functional applications are presented. Finally, a future outlook for TiO2&#8208;based PDs, particularly that of further functional applications is provided. This work will systematically illustrate the fundamentals of TiO2 and shed light on the preparation of more efficient TiO2 nanostructures and heterojunctions for future photoelectric applications.

Ge bidirectional diffusion, simultaneously toward the Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) absorber and MoSe2 at the back interface, is realized by an easy&#8208;handling method. The crystal growth of the absorbers is regulated and the work function of MoSe2 is enhanced as well. Up to 13.14% efficiency is achieved for Ge&#8208;involved CZTSSe solar cells, which present a certified efficiency of 12.8%.








Abstract
Aiming at a large open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) deficit in Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) solar cells, a new and effective strategy to simultaneously regulate the back interface and restrain bulk defects of CZTSSe absorbers is developed by directly introducing a thin GeO2 layer on Mo substrates. Power conversion efficiency (power&#8208;to&#8208;efficiency) as high as 13.14% with a VOC of 547&#160;mV is achieved for the champion device, which presents a certified efficiency of 12.8% (aperture area: 0.25667 cm2). Further investigation reveals that Ge bidirectional diffusion simultaneously occurs toward the CZTSSe absorber and MoSe2 layer at the back interface while being selenized. That is, some Ge element from the GeO2 diffuses into the CZTSSe absorber layer to afford Ge&#8208;doped absorbers, which can significantly reduce the defect density and band tailing, and facilitate quasi&#8208;Fermi level split by relatively higher hole concentration. Meanwhile, a small amount of Ge element also participates in the formation of MoSe2 at the back interface, thus enhancing the work function of MoSe2 and effectively separating photoinduced carriers. This work highlights the synergistic effect of Ge element toward the bulk absorber and the back interface and also provides an easy&#8208;handling way to achieve high&#8208;performance CZTSSe solar cells.

         <title>Engineered Exosomes with Independent Module/Cascading Function for Therapy of Parkinson's Disease by Multistep Targeting and Multistage Intervention Method</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of an &#8220;independent module/cascading function&#8221; to construct an engineered exosome nanotherapy platform is proposed. The artificial module with movement/chemotaxis ability is controllably combined with a natural exosome module with &#8220;one by one&#8221; mode by using a &#8220;differentiated&#8221; modification method, which realizes the &#8220;cascading function&#8221; for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.








Abstract
Current exosome engineering methods usually lead to the damage of exosome morphology and membrane, which cannot meet the complex needs of disease treatment. Herein, the concept of an &#8220;independent module/cascading function&#8221; is proposed to construct an engineered exosome nanotherapy platform including an independent artificial module and a natural module. The artificial module with movement/chemotaxis function is first synthesized, and then it is controllably combined with the natural exosome module with &#8220;one by one&#8221; mode through a &#8220;differentiated&#8221; modification method. The whole process can not only maintain the activity of the natural exosome module, but also endows it with motion ability, so as to realize the purpose of &#8220;cascading function&#8221; in the process of disease treatment. The above engineered exosomes are used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). Moreover, the multistep targeting strategy of &#8220;disease microenvironment&#8208;damaged cells&#8208;diseased mitochondria&#8221; and the multistage intervention concept of &#8220;inhibiting deterioration and promoting repair&#8221; are proposed, so as to break through the bottleneck of the existing treatment of PD.

         <title>Promoting Ex&#8208;Solution from Metal&#8211;Organic&#8208;Framework&#8208;Mediated Oxide Scaffolds for Highly Active and Robust Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ex&#8208;solution process is reconceptualized with the design of the host oxide structure using a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) as an oxide precursor. Owing to the structural advantages of the MOF, higher levels of doping and more uniform ex&#8208;solution are enabled. These ex&#8208;solved materials attain a record&#8208;breaking performance in acetone oxidation and acetone&#8208;detection reactions.








Abstract
Ex&#8208;solution catalysts, in which a host oxide is decorated with confined metallic nanoparticles, have exhibited breakthrough activity in various catalytic reactions. However, catalysts prepared by conventional ex&#8208;solution processes are limited by the low surface area of host oxides, the limited solubility of dopants, and the incomplete conversion of doped cations into metal catalysts. Here, the design of the host oxide structure is reconceptualized using a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) as an oxide precursor that can absorb a large quantity of ions while also promoting ex&#8208;solution at low temperatures (400&#8211;500&#160;&#176;C). The MOF&#8208;derived metal oxide host can readily incorporate metal cations, from which catalytic nanoparticles can be uniformly ex&#8208;solved owing to the short diffusion length in the nano&#8208;sized oxides. The distinct ex&#8208;solution behaviors of Pt, Pd, and Rh, and their bimetallic combinations are investigated. The MOF&#8208;driven mesoporous ZnO particles functionalized with PdPt catalysts ex&#8208;solved at 500&#160;&#176;C show benchmark&#8208;level of acetone oxidation activity as well as acetone&#8208;sensing characteristics by accelerating both oxygen chemisorption and acetone dissociation. Their findings provide a new route for the preparation of highly active catalysts by engineering the architecture and composition of the host oxide to facilitate the ex&#8208;solution process rationally.

         <title>How Reproducible are Surface Areas Calculated from the BET Equation?</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A round&#8208;robin study involving 61 labs is performed, and it is shown that the determination of Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller (BET) areas from identical isotherms is a largely ignored issue. To solve this, a new computational approach called &#8220;BET surface identification&#8221; (BETSI) is presented, which expands on the Rouquerol criteria, and which makes an unambiguous BET area calculation possible.








Abstract
Porosity and surface area analysis play a prominent role in modern materials science. At the heart of this sits the Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller (BET) theory, which has been a remarkably successful contribution to the field of materials science. The BET method was&#160;developed in the 1930s for open surfaces but is now the most widely used metric for the estimation of surface areas of micro&#8208; and mesoporous materials. Despite its widespread use, the calculation of BET surface areas causes a spread in reported areas, resulting in reproducibility problems in both academia and industry. To prove this, for this analysis, 18 already&#8208;measured raw adsorption isotherms were&#160;provided to sixty&#8208;one labs, who were&#160;asked to calculate the corresponding BET areas. This round&#8208;robin exercise resulted in a wide range of values. Here, the reproducibility of BET area determination from identical isotherms is demonstrated to be a largely ignored issue, raising critical concerns over the reliability of reported BET areas. To solve this major issue, a new computational approach to accurately and systematically determine the BET area of nanoporous materials is developed. The software, called &#8220;BET surface identification&#8221; (BETSI), expands on the well&#8208;known Rouquerol criteria and makes an unambiguous BET area assignment possible.

         <title>A Protein&#8208;Like Nanogel for Spinning Hierarchically Structured Artificial Spider Silk</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fiber is draw&#8208;spun from a soluble and crosslinked nanogel, and exhibits spider&#8208;silk&#8208;like hierarchical structures containing cross&#8208;links, aligned nanoassemblies, and sheath&#8211;core structures. Introducing nucleation seeds, prestretch, and a spiral architecture in the nanogel fiber further tunes the alignment and assembly of the polymer chains, and enhances the breaking strength (1.27 GPa) and toughness (383 MJ m&#8722;3).








Abstract
Spider dragline silk is draw&#8208;spun from soluble, &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;crosslinked spidroin in aqueous solution. This spider silk has an excellent combination of strength and toughness, which originates from the hierarchical structure containing &#946;&#8208;sheet crosslinking points, spiral nanoassemblies, a rigid sheath, and a soft core. Inspired by the spidroin structure and spider spinning process, a soluble and crosslinked nanogel is prepared and crosslinked fibers are drew spun with spider&#8208;silk&#8208;like hierarchical structures containing cross&#8208;links, aligned nanoassemblies, and sheath&#8211;core structures. Introducing nucleation seeds in the nanogel solution, and applying prestretch and a spiral architecture in the nanogel fiber, further tunes the alignment and assembly of the polymer chains, and enhances the breaking strength (1.27&#160;GPa) and toughness (383&#160;MJ m&#8722;3) to approach those of the best dragline silk. Theoretical modeling provides understanding for the dependence of the fiber's spinning capacity on the nanogel size. This work provides a new strategy for the direct spinning of tough fiber materials.

         <title>Formation of Pixelated Elastic Films via Capillary Suction of Curable Elastomers in Templated Hele&#8211;Shaw Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Capillary suction is a phenomenon in which surface tension spontaneously drives flow into confined geometries. This physics is leveraged to demonstrate a method for the passive assembly of soft materials using templated Hele&#8211;Shaw cells. These pixelated films are highly modular and can be designed to possess localized patterns and material properties.








Abstract
Natural materials are highly organized, frequently possessing intricate and sophisticated hierarchical structures from which superior properties emerge. In the wake of biomimicry, there is a growing interest in designing architected materials in the laboratory as such structures could enable myriad functionalities in engineering. Yet, their fabrication remains challenging despite recent progress in additive manufacturing. In particular, soft materials are typically poorly suited to form the requisite structures consisting of regular geometries. Here, a new frugal methodology is reported to fabricate pixelated soft materials. This approach is conceptually analogous to the watershed transform used in image analysis and allows the passive assembly of complex geometries through the capillary&#8208;mediated flow of curable elastomers in confined geometries. Emerging from sources distributed across a Hele&#8211;Shaw cell consisting of two parallel flat plates separated by an infinitesimally small gap, these flows eventually meet at the &#8220;dividing lines&#8221; thereby forming Voronoi tesselations. After curing is complete, these structures turn into composite elastic sheets. Rationalizing the fluid mechanics at play allows the structural geometry of the newly formed sheets to be tailored and thereby their local material&#160;properties to be tuned.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Assembled 3D Penetrating Nanonetwork for High&#8208;Performance Intrinsically Stretchable Polymer Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;assembled 3D penetrating nanonetwork tactic is developed based on high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight phenylenevinylene (L&#8208;SY&#8208;PPV) and polyacrylonitrile (PAN) to achieve increased stretchability and charge transportability simultaneously for blended emissive films. The obtained intrinsically stretchable polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes exhibit low turn&#8208;on voltage (6.5 V) and high luminescence (over 3780 cd m&#8211;2), simultaneously.








Abstract
The emergence of wearable technology can significantly benefit from electronic displays fabricated using intrinsically stretchable (is&#8208;) materials. Typically, an improvement in the stretchability of conventional light&#8208;emitting polymers is accompanied by a decrease in charge transportability, thus resulting in a significant decrease in device efficiency. In this study, a self&#8208;assembled 3D penetrating nanonetwork is developed to achieve increased stretchability and mobility simultaneously, based on high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight phenylenevinylene (L&#8208;SY&#8208;PPV) and polyacrylonitrile (PAN). The mobility of L&#8208;SY&#8208;PPV/PAN increases by 5&#8211;6 times and the stretchability increases from 20% (pristine L&#8208;SY&#8208;PPV film) to 100%. A high current efficiency (CE) of 8.13&#160;cd A&#8722;1 is observed in polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs) fabricated using 40% stretched L&#8208;SY&#8208;PPV/PAN. Furthermore, using a polyethyleneimine ethoxylated (PEIE), an 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline monohydrate (pBphen), and a reduced Triton X&#8208;100 (TR) chelated Zn&#8208;based is&#8208; electron&#8208;injection layer of Zn&#8208;PEIE&#8208;pBphen&#8208;TR, an is&#8208;PLED is realized with a turn&#8208;on voltage of 6.5&#160;V and a high CE of 2.35&#160;cd A&#8722;1. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of using the self&#8208;assembled 3D penetrating nanonetwork for the fabrication of is&#8208;PLEDs.

         <title>A Unique Fe&#8211;N4 Coordination System Enabling Transformation of Oxygen into Superoxide for Photocatalytic C&#63743;H Activation with High Efficiency and Selectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Activation of the &#945;&#8208;C&#63743;H bond of ethylbenzene by use of photocatalysis&#8208;generated superoxide anions (O2&#8226;&#8722;) remains a challenge. In this work, the formation of individual Fe atoms on polymeric carbon nitride, that activates O2&#160;to create O2&#8226;&#8722; for facilitating the reaction of ethylbenzene to form acetophenone, is demonstrated.








Abstract
Selective oxidation of C&#63743;H bonds is one of the most important reactions in organic synthesis. However, activation of the &#945;&#8208;C&#63743;H bond of ethylbenzene by use of photocatalysis&#8208;generated superoxide anions (O2&#8226;&#8722;) remains a challenge. Herein, the formation of individual Fe atoms on polymeric carbon nitride (CN), that activates O2&#160;to create O2&#8226;&#8722; for facilitating the reaction of ethylbenzene to form acetophenone, is demonstrated. By utilizing density functional theory and materials characterization techniques, it is shown that individual Fe atoms are coordinated to four N atoms of CN and the resultant low&#8208;spin Fe&#8211;N4&#160;system (t2g6eg0) is not only a great adsorption site for oxygen molecules, but also allows for fast transfer of electrons generated in the CN framework to adsorbed O2, producing O2&#8226;&#8722;. The oxidation reaction of ethylbenzene triggered by O2&#8226;&#8722; ions turns out to have a high conversion rate of 99% as well as an acetophenone selectivity of 99%, which can be ascribed to a novel reaction pathway that is different from the conventional route involving hydroxyl radicals and the production of phenethyl alcohol. Furthermore, it possesses great potential for other C&#63743;H activation reactions besides ethylbenzene oxidation.

         <title>Magnetic Anisotropy Control with Curie Temperature above 400 K in a van der Waals Ferromagnet for Spintronic Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic phase control is the source of fascinating correlated phenomena and the frontier research direction in materials science and spintronic devices. Magnetic anisotropy control and a dramatically enhanced Tc up to 400 K are realized in van der Waals ferromagnet Fe5GeTe2 during a high&#8208;pressure loading&#8211;deloading process, shedding light on exploring the exchange interaction mechanism and realizing practical spintronic applications.








Abstract
The technological appeal of van der Waals ferromagnetic materials is the ability to control magnetism under external fields with desired thickness toward novel spintronic applications. For practically useful devices, ferromagnetism above room temperature or tunable magnetic anisotropy is highly demanded but remains challenging. To date, only a few layered materials exhibit unambiguous ferromagnetic ordering at room temperature via gating techniques or interface engineering. Here, it is demonstrated that the magnetic anisotropy control and dramatic modulation of Curie temperature (Tc) up to 400 K are realized in layered Fe5GeTe2 via the high&#8208;pressure diamond&#8208;anvil&#8208;cell technique. Magnetic phases manifesting with in&#8208;plane anisotropic, out&#8208;of&#8208;plane anisotropic and nearly isotropic magnetic states can be tuned in a controllable way, depicted by the phase diagram with a maximum Tc up to 360 K. Remarkably, the Tc can be gradually enhanced to above 400 K owing to the Fermi surface evolution during a pressure loading&#8211;deloading process. Such an observation sheds light on the understanding and control of emergent magnetic states in practical spintronic applications.

         <title>More Powerful Twistron Carbon Nanotube Yarn Mechanical Energy Harvesters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
More powerful twistron carbon nanotube yarn mechanical energy harvesters are achieved by mechanically and thermally modifying the fundamental structure of twistrons and by incorporating graphene sheets within twistrons. The energy conversion efficiency of the twistrons can be increased over 7&#8208;fold and the peak power output can reach values that are 12&#8208;fold those reported for previous materials&#8208;based technologies for key frequency ranges.








Abstract
Stretching a coiled carbon nanotube (CNT) yarn can provide large, reversible electrochemical capacitance changes, which convert mechanical energy to electricity. Here, it is shown that the performance of these &#8220;twistron&#8221; harvesters can be increased by optimizing the alignment of precursor CNT forests, plastically stretching the precursor twisted yarn, applying much higher tensile loads during precoiling twist than for coiling, using electrothermal pulse annealing under tension, and incorporating reduced graphene oxide nanoplates. The peak output power for a 1 and a 30&#160;Hz sinusoidal deformation are 0.73 and 3.19&#160;kW&#160;kg&#8722;1, respectively, which are 24&#8208; and 13&#8208;fold that of previous twistron harvesters at these respective frequencies. This performance at 30&#160;Hz is over 12&#8208;fold that of other prior&#8208;art mechanical energy harvesters for frequencies between 0.1 and 600&#160;Hz. The maximum energy conversion efficiency is 7.2&#8208;fold that for previous twistrons. Twistron anode and cathode yarn arrays are stretched 180&#176; out&#8208;of&#8208;phase by locating them in the negative and positive compressibility directions of hinged wine&#8208;rack frames, thereby doubling the output voltage and reducing the input mechanical energy.

         <title>A Light&#8208;Hole Germanium Quantum Well on Silicon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silicon&#8208;integrated light&#8208;hole quantum wells: a versatile platform toward coherent optical photon&#8211;spin interfaces for a direct mapping of the quantum information encoded in photon flying qubits to stationary spin processor is reported.








Abstract
The quiet quantum environment of holes in solid&#8208;state devices is at the core of increasingly reliable architectures for quantum processors and memories. However, due to the lack of scalable materials to properly tailor the valence band character and its energy offsets, the precise engineering of light&#8208;hole (LH) states remains a serious obstacle toward coherent optical photon&#8211;spin interfaces needed for a direct mapping of the quantum information encoded in photon flying qubits to stationary spin processors. Herein, to alleviate this long&#8208;standing limitation, an all&#8208;group&#8208;IV low&#8208;dimensional system is demonstrated, consisting of a highly tensile strained germanium quantum well grown on silicon allowing new degrees of freedom to control and manipulate the hole states. Wafer&#8208;level, high bi&#8208;isotropic in&#8208;plane tensile strain (&lt;1%) is achieved using strain&#8208;engineered, metastable germanium&#8211;tin alloyed buffer layers yielding quantum wells with LH ground state, high g&#8208;factor anisotropy, and a tunable splitting of the hole sub&#8208;bands. The epitaxial heterostructures display sharp interfaces with sub&#8208;nanometer broadening and show room&#8208;temperature excitonic transitions that are modulated and extended to the mid&#8208;wave infrared by controlling strain and thickness. This ability to engineer quantum structures with LH selective confinement and controllable optical response enables manufacturable silicon&#8208;compatible platforms relevant to integrated quantum communication and sensing technologies.

         <title>Engineering DNA&#8208;Guided Hydroxyapatite Bulk Materials with High Stiffness and Outstanding Antimicrobial Ability for Dental Inlay Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrastiff DNA&#8211;hydroxyapatite bulk composites are fabricated by in situ mineralization in a long&#8208;range ordered DNA scaffold. The as&#8208;prepared composites exhibit an ultrahigh Young's modulus and a long&#8208;lasting and local antibacterial behavior. A new type of artificial dental inlay with outstanding antibacterial ability is thus developed for dental restoration applications.








Abstract
Programmable base pair interactions at the nanoscale make DNA an attractive scaffold for forming hydroxyapatite (HAP) nanostructures. However, engineering macroscale HAP mineralization guided by DNA molecules remains challenging. To overcome this issue, a facile strategy is developed for the fabrication of ultrastiff DNA&#8211;HAP bulk composites. The electrostatic complexation of DNA and a surfactant with a quaternary ammonium salt group enables the formation of long&#8208;range ordered scaffolds using electrospinning. The growth of 1D and 2D HAP minerals is thus realized by this DNA template at a macroscale. Remarkably, the as&#8208;prepared DNA&#8211;HAP composites exhibit an ultrahigh Young's modulus of &#8776;25&#160;GPa, which is comparable to natural HAP and superior to most artificial mineralized composites. Furthermore, a&#160;new type of dental inlay with outstanding antibacterial properties is developed using the stiff DNA&#8211;HAP. The encapsulated quaternary ammonium group within the dense HAP endows the composite with long&#8208;lasting and local antibacterial activity. Therefore, this new type of super&#8208;stiff biomaterial holds great potential for oral prosthetic applications.

         <title>Local Coordination Regulation through Tuning Atomic&#8208;Scale Cavities of Pd Metallene toward Efficient Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic&#8208;scale cavities of ultrathin (111)&#8208;exposed Pd metallene, which can increase coordination number and result in moderate downshifting of the d&#8208;band center, are proposed as a new active site for boosting oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysis.








Abstract
Moderate adsorption of oxygenated intermediates takes a significant role in rational design of high&#8208;efficiency oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts. Long&#8208;serving as a reliable strategy to tune geometric structure of nanomaterials, defect engineering enjoys the great ability of adjusting the coordination environment of catalytic active sites, which enables dominant regulation of adsorption energy and kinetics of ORR catalysis.

     alt="Local Coordination Regulation through Tuning Atomic-Scale Cavities of Pd Metallene toward Efficient Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atomic-scale cavities of ultrathin (111)-exposed Pd metallene, which can increase coordination number and result in moderate downshifting of the d-band center, are proposed as a new active site for boosting oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysis.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moderate adsorption of oxygenated intermediates takes a significant role in rational design of high-efficiency oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts. Long-serving as a reliable strategy to tune geometric structure of nanomaterials, defect engineering enjoys the great ability of adjusting the coordination environment of catalytic active sites, which enables dominant regulation of adsorption energy and kinetics of ORR catalysis. However, limited to controllable nanocrystals fabrication, inducing uniformly dispersed high-coordinated defects into ultrathin 2D nanosheets remains challenging. Herein, atomic-scale cavities (ASCs) are proposed as a new kind of high-coordinated active site and successfully introduced into suprathin Pd (111)-exposed metallene. Due to its atomic concave architecture, leading to elevated CN and moderately downshifted d-band center, the as-made Pd metallene with ASCs (&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;-Pd M) exhibits excellent ORR performance with mass activity of 2.76 A mg&lt;sub&gt;Pd&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.9&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and half-wave potential as high as 0.947&#160;V, which is 18.9 (2.7) times higher and 104 (46) mV larger than that of commercial Pt/C (Pd metallene without ASCs). Besides, the durability of &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;-Pd M exceeds its commercial counterpart with &#8776;30% loss after 5000 cycles. This work highlights a new-style mentality of designing fancy active sites toward efficient ORR electrocatalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Activated Ni&#8211;OH Bonds in a Catalyst Facilitates the Nucleophile Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nucleophile oxidation reaction (NOR) is a complex reaction including electrochemical step and spontaneous non&#8208;electrochemical process. The interlayer Pt nanosheets and multiple defects of Ni3Fe LDH&#8208;Pt NS enable the activated Ni2+&#8211;OH to exhibit an excellent NOR activity. More importantly, spontaneous non&#8208;electrochemical steps, including proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer, hydration, and rearrangement, lead to diverse nucleophile dehydrogenation oxidation pathways of different NOR systems.








Abstract
The nucleophile oxidation reaction (NOR) is of enormous significance for organic electrosynthesis and coupling for hydrogen generation. However, the nonuniform NOR mechanism limits its development. For the NOR, involving electrocatalysis and organic chemistry, both the electrochemical step and non&#8208;electrochemical process should be taken into account. The NOR of nickel&#8208;based hydroxides includes the electrogenerated dehydrogenation of the Ni2+&#8211;OH bond and a spontaneous non&#8208;electrochemical process; the former determines the electrochemical activity, and the nucleophile oxidation pathway depends on the latter. Herein, the space&#8208;confinement&#8208;induced synthesis of Ni3Fe layered double hydroxide intercalated with single&#8208;atom&#8208;layer Pt nanosheets (Ni3Fe LDH&#8208;Pt NS) is reported. The synergy of interlayer Pt nanosheets and multiple defects activates Ni&#8211;OH bonds, thus exhibiting an excellent NOR performance. The spontaneous non&#8208;electrochemical steps of the NOR are revealed, such as proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET; Ni3+&#8211;O + X&#8211;H = Ni2+&#8211;OH + X&#8226;), hydration, and rearrangement. Hence, the reaction pathway of the NOR is deciphered, which not only helps to perfect the NOR mechanism, but also provides inspiration for organic electrosynthesis.

         <title>Large&#8208;Scale Integration of a Zinc Metasilicate Interface Layer Guiding Well&#8208;Regulated Zn Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;temperature wet&#8208;chemistry strategy with industrial operability is developed to realize large&#8208;scale integration of Zn&#8211;Si&#8211;O nanosheet arrays on Zn foil. Zn&#8208;island&#8208;based identical&#8208;location electron microscopy characterization is designed to visualize and uncover the in situ integration mechanism of Zn&#8211;Si&#8211;O layer. The life spans of symmetric cells, and full cells coupled with high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading cathode, have increased by 3&#8211;7 times.








Abstract
Uneven distribution of electric fields at the electrolyte&#8211;anode interface and associated Zn dendrite growth is one of the most critical barriers that limit the life span of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, new&#8208;type Zn&#8211;A&#8211;O (A = Si, Ti) interface layers with thin and uniform thickness, porosity, and hydrophilicity properties are developed to realize homogeneous and smooth Zn plating. For ZnSiO3 nanosheet arrays on Zn foil (Zn@ZSO), their formation follows an &#8220;etching&#8211;nucleation&#8211;growth&#8221; mechanism that is confirmed by a well&#8208;designed Zn&#8208;island&#8208;based identical&#8208;location microscopy method, the geometric area of which is up to 1000 cm2 in one&#8208;pot synthesis based on a low&#8208;temperature wet&#8208;chemical method. Guided by the structural advantages of the ZSO layer, the Zn2+ flux gets equalized. Besides ultralow polarization, the life spans of symmetric cells and full cells coupled with a high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading K0.27MnO2&#183;0.54H2O (8&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) cathode, are increased by 3&#8211;7 times with the Zn@ZSO anode. Moreover, the large&#8208;scale preparation of Zn@ZSO foil contributes to a 0.5 Ah multilayer pouch cell with high performance, further confirming its prospects for practical application.

         <title>Boosting H2 Production from a BiVO4 Photoelectrochemical Biomass Fuel Cell by the Construction of a Bridge for Charge and Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique BiVO4 photoelectrochemical fuel cell is successfully developed by utilizing the low&#8208;cost tartaric acid biomass as an organic fuel. The strong complexation between BiVO4 and tartaric acid provides a bridge for charge and energy transfer. The optimal BiVO4 photoanode exhibits a remarkable current density of 13.54 mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.23 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode under AM1.5G.








Abstract
Utilizing a photoelectrochemical (PEC) fuel cell to replace difficult water oxidation with facile oxidation of organic wastes is regarded as an effective method to improve the H2 production efficiency. However, in most reported PEC fuel cells, their PEC activities are still low and the energy in organic fuels cannot be effectively utilized. Here, a unique BiVO4 PEC fuel cell is successfully developed by utilizing the low&#8208;cost biomass, tartaric acid, as an organic fuel. Thanks to the strong complexation between BiVO4 and tartaric acid, a bridge for the charge and energy transfer is successfully constructed, which not only improves the photoelectric conversion efficiency of BiVO4, but also effectively converts the chemical energy of biomass into H2. Remarkably, under AM1.5G illumination, the optimal nanoporous BiVO4 photoanode exhibits a high current density of 13.54&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#160;V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) for H2 production, which is higher than that of previously reported PEC water splitting systems or PEC fuel cell systems. This work opens a new path for solving the low PEC H2 production efficiency and provides a new idea for improving the performances and energy conversion efficiency in traditional PEC fuel cells.

         <dc:description>
The bandgap of Cs0.22FA0.78Pb (I0.85Br0.15)3 is widened from 1.64 to 1.67 eV by adding 3 mol% CsPbCl3&#8208;clusters. Adding extra 2 mol% CsCl can enrich Cl at the NiOx/perovskite interface, thereby preventing the redox reaction at the interface and improving the photostability of the wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite. This enables efficient p&#8211;i&#8211;n&#8208;type NiOx&#8208;based perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells with PCE up to 27.26%.








Abstract
Nickel oxide (NiOx) is an attractive hole&#8208;transport material for efficient and stable p&#8211;i&#8211;n metal&#8208;halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, an undesirable redox reaction occurs at the NiOx/perovskite interface, which results in a low open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC), instability, and phase separation of the NiOx&#8208;based wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite (Br &gt; 20%). In order to simultaneously address the abovementioned phase separation problem and redox chemistry at the perovskite/NiOx interface, the bandgap is widened from 1.64 to 1.67 eV by adding inorganic CsPbCl3&#8208;clusters (3 mol%) to the Cs22Br15 perovskite precursor solution. Moreover, adding extra 2 mol% CsCl enriches the NiOx/perovskite interface with Cl, thereby preventing the redox reaction at the interface, while controlling the Br content to within 15% improves the photostability of the wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite. Consequently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of a single&#8208;junction p&#8211;i&#8211;n PSC increases from 17.82% to 19.76%, which leads to the fabrication of highly efficient monolithic p&#8211;i&#8211;n&#8208;type NiOx&#8208;based perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells with PCEs of up to 27.26% (certified PCE: 27.15%). The perovskite to an n&#8211;i&#8211;p&#8208;type perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell is also applied to deliver a VOC of 1.93 V and a final efficiency of 25.5%. These findings provide critical insight into the fabrication of highly efficient and stable wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites.

A direct deep ultraviolet (DUV) photolithography method, which enables fabrication of microstructures in bulk polystyrene cell culture substrates, is presented. Pipelines for generating ink&#8208;based DUV masks and micropattern virtualization further increase the remarkable straightforwardness of the process. This, combined with the high applicability, can significantly improve accessibility of this class of microfabrication techniques to a broad biological research community.








Abstract
Tissue&#8208;culture&#8208;ware polystyrene is the gold standard for in vitro cell culture. While microengineering techniques can create advanced cell microenvironments in polystyrene, they require specialized equipment and reagents, which hinder their accessibility for most biological researchers. An economical and easily accessible method is developed and validated for fabricating microstructures directly in polystyrene with sizes approaching subcellular dimensions while requiring minimal processing time. The process involves deep ultraviolet irradiation through a shadow mask or ink pattern using inexpensive, handheld devices followed by selective chemical development with common reagents to generate micropatterns with depths/heights between 5 and 10&#160;&#181;m, which can be used to guide cell behavior. The remarkable straightforwardness of the process enables this class of microengineering techniques to be broadly accessible to diverse research communities.

         <title>Tailoring Ultrafast and High&#8208;Capacity Sodium Storage via Binding&#8208;Energy&#8208;Driven Atomic Scissors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ge metal with remarkable alloying ability is utilized as novel chemical scissors to controllably reconstruct Ge&#63743;S bonds in the sulfide matrix to fabricate a new GeTiS3 compound. The integrated alloying&#8208;conversion and surface&#8208;dominated redox reactions with enhanced capacitive contribution enable high&#8208;rate and high&#8208;capacity sodium storage.








Abstract
Controllably tailoring alloying anode materials to achieve fast charging and enhanced structural stability is crucial for sodium&#8208;ion batteries with high rate and high capacity performance, yet remains a significant challenge owing to the huge volume change and sluggish sodiation kinetics. Here, a chemical tailoring tool is proposed and developed by atomically dispersing high&#8208;capacity Ge metal into the rigid and conductive sulfide framework for controllable reconstruction of Ge&#63743;S bonds to synergistically realize high capacity and high rate performance for sodium storage. The integrated GeTiS3 material with stable Ti&#8211;S framework and weak Ge&#63743;S bonding delivers high specific capacities of 678 mA h g&#8722;1 at 0.3 C over 100 cycles and 209 mA h g&#8722;1 at 32 C over 10&#160;000 cycles, outperforming most of the reported alloying type anode materials for sodium storage. Interestingly, in situ Raman, X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), and ex situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterizations reveal the formation of well&#8208;dispersed NaxGe confined in the rigid Ti&#8211;S matrix with suppressed volume change after discharge. The synergistically coupled alloying&#8208;conversion and surface&#8208;dominated redox reactions with enhanced capacitive contribution and high reaction reversibility by a binding&#8208;energy&#8208;driven atomic scissors method would break new ground on designing a high&#8208;rate and high&#8208;capacity sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Boosting Electrochemical Styrene Transformation via Tandem Water Oxidation over a Single&#8208;Atom Cr1/CoSe2 Catalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tandem oxidation strategy based on a Co&#8211;Cr cooperated single&#8208;atom Cr1/CoSe2 electrocatalyst is presented, turning the competition between the oxygen evolution reaction and styrene oxidation into mutual benefits via the migration of the *OOH intermediate from the Co to the Cr site, achieving an efficient and mild selective oxidation of styrene without any exogenous oxidizing reagent.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic oxidation of organics using water as the oxygen source is a prospective but challenging method to produce high&#8208;value&#8208;added chemicals; especially, the competitive oxygen evolution reaction (OER) limits its efficiency. Herein, a tandem catalysis strategy based on a single&#8208;atom catalyst with Cr atoms atomically dispersed at a CoSe2 support (Cr1/CoSe2) is presented. Thereinto, Co and Cr sites are endowed with a specific function to activate water and styrene respectively, and the competition between the OER and styrene oxidation is turned into mutual benefits via cooperated active sites. Under a potential of 1.6&#160;VAg/AgCl, excellent selectivity of 95% to benzaldehyde and a high conversion rate of styrene at 88% without any exogenous oxidizing reagent are achieved. Isotopic tracing, isotope&#8208;labeled in situ Raman spectra, and detailed theoretical calculation further reveal the tandem mechanism, showing that the transfer of *OOH intermediates from the Co to the Cr sites serves as a bridge to link the oxidation of water and styrene. This work develops a new strategy for the co&#8208;oxidation of multi&#8208;species based on tandem catalysis, providing novel insights for the design of single&#8208;atom catalysts.

         <title>Ultrasensitive Mid&#8208;Infrared Biosensing in Aqueous Solutions with Graphene Plasmons</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ identification of biomolecules in aqueous solutions by IR spectroscopy is important for exploring biological processes. However, the strong and broad IR absorption of water overwhelms the vibrations of the biomolecules. In this work, a tunable graphene plasmonic aqueous IR biosensor is exploited to directly probe a protein's vibrations and characterize the deuterium effects, which provides a platform for studying nanoscale biological processes.

Identifying nanoscale biomolecules in aqueous solutions by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) provides an in situ and noninvasive method for exploring the structure, reactions, and transport of biologically active molecules. However, this remains a challenge due to the strong and broad IR absorption of water which overwhelms the respective vibrational fingerprints of the biomolecules. In this work, a tunable IR transparent microfluidic system with graphene plasmons is exploited to identify &#8776;2&#160;nm&#8208;thick proteins in physiological conditions. The acquired in situ tunability makes it possible to eliminate the IR absorption of water outside the graphene plasmonic hotspots by background subtraction. Most importantly, the ultrahigh confinement of graphene plasmons (confined to &#8776;15&#160;nm) permits the implementation of nanoscale sensitivity. Then, the deuterium effects on monolayer proteins are characterized within an aqueous solution. The tunable graphene&#8208;plasmon&#8208;enhanced FTIR technology provides a novel platform for studying biological processes in an aqueous solution at the nanoscale.

         <title>Submolecular Ligand Size and Spacing for Cell Adhesion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Submolecular tuning of ligand size and spacing is demonstrated via template&#8208;mediated in situ growth of nanoparticles. It is revealed that submolecular ligand spacing stimulates integrin binding to facilitate the adhesion&#8208;mediated pro&#8208;regenerative polarization of macrophages. Increasing ligand spacing only significantly inhibits macrophage adhesion, whereas increasing both ligand size and spacing slightly hinders macrophage adhesion.








Abstract
Cell adhesion occurs when integrin recognizes and binds to Arg&#8211;Gly&#8211;Asp (RGD) ligands present in fibronectin. In this work, submolecular ligand size and spacing are tuned via template&#8208;mediated in situ growth of nanoparticles for dynamic macrophage modulation. To tune liganded gold nanoparticle (GNP) size and spacing from 3 to 20&#160;nm, in situ localized assemblies of GNP arrays on nanomagnetite templates are engineered. 3&#160;nm&#8208;spaced ligands stimulate the binding of integrin, which mediates macrophage&#8208;adhesion&#8208;assisted pro&#8208;regenerative polarization as compared to 20&#160;nm&#8208;spaced ligands, which can be dynamically anchored to the substrate for stabilizing integrin binding and facilitating dynamic macrophage adhesion. Increasing the ligand size from 7 to 20&#160;nm only slightly promotes macrophage adhesion, not observed with 13&#160;nm&#8208;sized ligands. Increasing the ligand spacing from 3 to 17&#160;nm significantly hinders macrophage adhesion that induces inflammatory polarization. Submolecular tuning of ligand spacing can dominantly modulate host macrophages.

         <title>Targeted Drug/Gene/Photodynamic Therapy via a Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Dendritic&#8208;Polymer&#8208;Based Nanococktail for Treatment of EGFR&#8208;TKI&#8208;Resistant Non&#8208;Small&#8208;Cell Lung Cancer</title>

A nanococktail therapeutic strategy is proposed to treat epidermal growth factor receptor&#8208;tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR&#8208;TKI)&#8208;resistant non&#8208;small&#8208;cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by employing stimuli&#8208;responsive block&#8208;dendritic&#8208;polymer&#8208;based nanoparticles for targeted co&#8208;delivery of gefitinib and Yes&#8208;associated protein (YAP)&#8208;siRNA. The nanosystem can block the EGFR signaling pathway with gefitinib, inhibit the EGFR bypass signaling pathway via YAP&#8208;siRNA, and induce tumor cell apoptosis by photodynamic therapy.








Abstract
Yes&#8208;associated protein (YAP) has been identified as a key driver for epidermal growth factor receptor&#8208;tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR&#8208;TKI) resistance. Inhibition of YAP expression could be a potential therapeutic option for treating non&#8208;small&#8208;cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Herein, a nanococktail therapeutic strategy is proposed by employing amphiphilic and block&#8208;dendritic&#8208;polymer&#8208;based nanoparticles (NPs) for targeted co&#8208;delivery of EGFR&#8208;TKI gefitinib (Gef) and YAP&#8208;siRNA to achieve a targeted drug/gene/photodynamic therapy. The resulting NPs are effectively internalized into Gef&#8208;resistant NSCLC cells, successfully escape from late endosomes/lysosomes, and responsively release Gef and YAP&#8208;siRNA in an intracellular reductive environment. They preferentially accumulate at the tumor site after intravenous injection in both cell&#8208;line&#8208;derived xenograft (CDX) and patient&#8208;derived xenograft (PDX) models of Gef&#8208;resistant NSCLC, resulting in potent antitumor efficacy without distinct toxicity after laser irradiation. Mechanism studies reveal that the cocktail therapy could block the EGFR signaling pathway with Gef, inhibit activation of the EGFR bypass signaling pathway via YAP&#8208;siRNA, and induce tumor cell apoptosis through photodynamic therapy (PDT). Furthermore, this combination nanomedicine can sensitize PDT and impair glycolysis by downregulating HIF&#8208;1&#945;. These results suggest that this stimuli&#8208;responsive dendritic&#8208;polymer&#8208;based nanococktail therapy may provide a promising approach for the treatment of EGFR&#8208;TKI resistant NSCLC.

         <dc:description>
It is a time&#8208;consuming, laborious, and resource&#8208;intensive task to control the catalytic activity of nanozymes. A data&#8208;driven approach that utilizes machine&#8208;learning algorithms is trained on extracted data to understand particle&#8211;property relationships, allowing for classification and quantitative predictions of enzyme&#8208;like activity exhibited by nanozymes. This study offers a promising model to develop nanozymes with desirable catalytic activity.








Abstract
An abundant number of nanomaterials have been discovered to possess enzyme&#8208;like catalytic activity, termed nanozymes. It is identified that a variety of internal and external factors influence the catalytic activity of nanozymes. However, there is a lack of essential methodologies to uncover the hidden mechanisms between nanozyme features and enzyme&#8208;like activity. Here, a data&#8208;driven approach is demonstrated that utilizes machine&#8208;learning algorithms to understand particle&#8211;property relationships, allowing for classification and quantitative predictions of enzyme&#8208;like activity exhibited by nanozymes. High consistency between predicted outputs and the observations is confirmed by accuracy (90.6%) and R2 (up to 0.80). Furthermore, sensitive analysis of the models reveals the central roles of transition metals in determining nanozyme activity. As an example, the models are successfully applied to predict or design desirable nanozymes by uncovering the hidden relationship between different periods of transition metals and their enzyme&#8208;like performance. This study offers a promising strategy to develop nanozymes with desirable catalytic activity and demonstrates the potential of machine learning within the field of material science.

         <title>Flexible and Tough Superelastic Co&#8211;Cr Alloys for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel developed Co&#8211;Cr&#8208;based biomaterial not only has a low Young's modulus (10&#8211;30 GPa) similar to human bone, but also a high wear resistance, disrupting the trade&#8208;off relation in conventional metallic biomaterials. The thermoelastic martensitic transformation of these alloys allows a huge recoverable superelastic strain up to 17.0%, which is twice that of commercial Ti&#8211;Ni.








Abstract
The demand for biomaterials has been increasing along with the increase in the population of elderly people worldwide. The mechanical properties and high wear resistance of metallic biomaterials make them well&#8208;suited for use as substitutes or as support for damaged hard tissues. However, unless these biomaterials also have a low Young's modulus similar to that of human bones, bone atrophy inevitably occurs. Because a low Young's modulus is typically associated with poor wear resistance, it is difficult to realize a low Young's modulus and high wear resistance simultaneously. Also, the superelastic property of shape&#8208;memory alloys makes them suitable for biomedical applications, like vascular stents and guide wires. However, due to the low recoverable strain of conventional biocompatible shape&#8208;memory alloys, the demand for a new alloy system is high. The novel body&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic cobalt&#8211;chromium&#8208;based alloys in this work provide a solution to both of these problems. The Young's modulus of &lt;001&gt;&#8208;oriented&#160;single&#8208;crystal cobalt&#8211;chromium&#8208;based alloys is 10&#8211;30 GPa, which is similar to that of human bone, and they also demonstrate high wear and corrosion resistance. They also exhibit superelasticity with a huge recoverable strain up to 17.0%. For these reasons, the novel cobalt&#8211;chromium&#8208;based alloys can be promising candidates for biomedical applications.

The mechanical properties and high wear resistance of metallic biomaterials make them well-suited for use as substitutes or as support for damaged hard tissues. However, unless these biomaterials also have a low Young's modulus similar to that of human bones, bone atrophy inevitably occurs. Because a low Young's modulus is typically associated with poor wear resistance, it is difficult to realize a low Young's modulus and high wear resistance simultaneously. Also, the superelastic property of shape-memory alloys makes them suitable for biomedical applications, like vascular stents and guide wires. However, due to the low recoverable strain of conventional biocompatible shape-memory alloys, the demand for a new alloy system is high. The novel body-centered-cubic cobalt&#8211;chromium-based alloys in this work provide a solution to both of these problems. The Young's modulus of &amp;lt;001&amp;gt;-oriented&#160;single-crystal cobalt&#8211;chromium-based alloys is 10&#8211;30 GPa, which is similar to that of human bone, and they also demonstrate high wear and corrosion resistance. They also exhibit superelasticity with a huge recoverable strain up to 17.0%. For these reasons, the novel cobalt&#8211;chromium-based alloys can be promising candidates for biomedical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Electron&#8208;Driving Observations of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 Photoreduction on Co&#8208;Doped CeO2/Crystalline Carbon Nitride S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunctions</title>

Atomic&#8208;level regulation of S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions is designed by integrating Co&#8208;doped CeO2 nanoparticles with highly crystalline poly(triazine imide), of which the surface Co&#8208;embedded CeCo conjunction features functionalized Co species toward the boosted directional electron&#8208;driving effect from the carbon nitride donations to site&#8208;specific Co hubs, thus promoting electronic transferability for multiple electrons&#8208;involving CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 photoreduction.








Abstract
Photoexcited dynamic modulation, maximizing the effective utilization of photoinduced electron&#8211;hole pairs, dominates the multiple electrons&#8208;involving reduction pathways for terminal CH4 evolution during CO2 photoreduction. Yet, the site&#8208;specific regulation of directional charge transfer by modification of an S&#8208;scheme heterojunction has seldom been discussed. Herein, an atomic&#8208;level tailoring strategy by anchoring single&#8208;atomic Co into CeO2 co&#8208;catalyst rather than carbon nitride supports, which can selectively favor CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 photoreduction, is reported. Through in situ dynamic tracking investigations, this study identifies that surface Co&#8208;embedded bimetallic CeCo conjunction is the key feature driving a strong interconnection of dynamical charge states through S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions. The Co&#8208;embedded modification into CeO2 co&#8208;catalysts is demonstrated to have a critical effect on directional charge control, accelerating the driving of electrons from the carbon nitride donations to site&#8208;specific Co hubs, which thereby promotes electronic transferability for electrons&#8208;involving CH4 formation. As a result, an unprecedented CH4 yield (181.7&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1) is obtained with a high turnover number (411.4) through a fully gas&#8211;solid reaction, demonstrating its potential toward targeted CH4 formation without adding any sacrificial agent.

         <title>Biaxially Strained MoS2 Nanoshells with Controllable Layers Boost Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effect of biaxial strain and layer numbers of MoS2 nanoshells on the electrocatalytic activity is investigated in detail. Calculations reveal the superiority of biaxial strain over uniaxial strain and identify the ideal Mo coordination and S vacancies for maximal catalytic activity.








Abstract
Strain in layered transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is a type of effective approach to enhance the catalytic performance by activating their inert basal plane. However, compared with traditional uniaxial strain, the influence of biaxial strain and the TMD layer number on the local electronic configuration remains unexplored. Herein, via a new in situ self&#8208;vulcanization strategy, biaxially strained MoS2 nanoshells in the form of a single&#8208;crystalline Ni3S2@MoS2 core&#8211;shell heterostructure are realized, where the MoS2 layer is precisely controlled between the 1 and 5 layers. In particular, an electrode with the bilayer MoS2 nanoshells shows a remarkable hydrogen evolution reaction activity with a small overpotential of 78.1&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8208;2, and negligible activity degradation after durability testing. Density functional theory calculations reveal the contribution of the optimized biaxial strain together with the induced sulfur vacancies and identify the origin of superior catalytic sites in these biaxially strained MoS2 nanoshells. This work highlights the importance of the atomic&#8208;scale layer number and multiaxial strain in unlocking the potential of 2D TMD electrocatalysts.

         <title>Active Ultrahigh&#8208;Q (0.2 &#215; 106) THz Topological Cavities on a Chip</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;loss terahertz (THz) silicon topological interconnect&#8211;cavity system that can actively route signals through sharp bends by critically coupling to a topological cavity with an ultrahigh&#8208;quality (Q) factor of 0.2 &#215; 106 is shown. On&#8208;chip active tailoring is demonstrated of the cavity resonance linewidth, frequency, and modulation at extremely low power through complete suppression of the back reflection, essential for sixth generation (6G) communication with THz topological integrated photonic circuits.








Abstract
Rapid scaling of semiconductor devices has led to an increase in the number of processor cores and integrated functionalities onto a single chip to support the growing demands of high&#8208;speed and large&#8208;volume consumer electronics. To meet this burgeoning demand, an improved interconnect capacity in terms of bandwidth density and active tunability is required for enhanced throughput and energy efficiency. Low&#8208;loss terahertz silicon interconnects with larger bandwidth offer a solution for the existing inter&#8208;/intrachip bandwidth density and energy&#8208;efficiency bottleneck. Here, a low&#8208;loss terahertz topological interconnect&#8211;cavity system is presented that can actively route signals through sharp bends, by critically coupling to a topological cavity with an ultrahigh&#8208;quality (Q) factor of 0.2 &#215; 106. The topologically protected large Q factor cavity enables energy&#8208;efficient optical control showing 60&#160;dB modulation. Dynamic control is further demonstrated of the critical coupling between the topological interconnect&#8211;cavity for on&#8208;chip active tailoring of the cavity resonance linewidth, frequency, and modulation through complete suppression of the back reflection. The silicon topological cavity is complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS)&#8208;compatible and highly desirable for hybrid electronic&#8211;photonic technologies for sixth (6G) generation terahertz communication devices. Ultrahigh&#8208;Q cavity also paves the path for designing ultrasensitive topological sensors, terahertz topological integrated circuits, and nonlinear topological photonic devices.

         <title>The Role of Long&#8208;Alkyl&#8208;Group Spacers in Glycolated Copolymers for High&#8208;Performance Organic Electrochemical Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
New molecular design rules are established to overcome the trade&#8208;off between electronic and ionic conduction in OECTs. The gDPP&#8208;TTVTT copolymer achieves the best operational stability and maximum transconductance of 61.9 S cm&#8722;1. The long&#8208;alkyl&#8208;group spacer prevents morphological and electrostatic disruptions to the conjugated backbone, maintaining high electronic charge&#8208;carrier mobilities, while increasing ion density for efficient and stable OECTs.








Abstract
Semiconducting polymers with oligoethylene glycol (OEG) sidechains have attracted strong research interest for organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) applications. However, key molecular design rules for high&#8208;performance OECTs via efficient mixed electronic/ionic charge transport are still unclear. In this work, new glycolated copolymers (gDPP&#8208;TTT and gDPP&#8208;TTVTT) with diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) acceptor and thiophene (T) and vinylene (V) thiophene&#8208;based donor units are synthesized and characterized for accumulation mode OECTs, where a long&#8208;alkyl&#8208;group (C12) attached to the DPP unit acts as a spacer distancing the OEG groups from the polymer backbone. gDPP&#8208;TTVTT shows the highest OECT transconductance (61.9 S cm&#8211;1) and high operational stability, compared to gDPP&#8208;TTT and their alkylated counterparts. Surprisingly, gDPP&#8208;TTVTT also shows high electronic charge mobility in a field&#8208;effect transistor, suggesting efficient ion injection/diffusion without hindering its efficient electronic charge transport. The elongated donor unit (TTVTT) facilitates hole polaron formation to be more localized to the donor unit, leading to faster and easier polaron formation with less impact on polymer structure during OECT operation, as opposed to the TTT unit. This is supported by molecular dynamics simulation. These simultaneously high electronic and ionic charge&#8208;transport properties are achieved due to the long&#8208;alkyl&#8208;group spacer in amphipathic sidechains, providing an important molecular design rule for glycolated copolymers.

In this work, new glycolated copolymers (gDPP-TTT and gDPP-TTVTT) with diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) acceptor and thiophene (T) and vinylene (V) thiophene-based donor units are synthesized and characterized for accumulation mode OECTs, where a long-alkyl-group (C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;) attached to the DPP unit acts as a spacer distancing the OEG groups from the polymer backbone. gDPP-TTVTT shows the highest OECT transconductance (61.9 S cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and high operational stability, compared to gDPP-TTT and their alkylated counterparts. Surprisingly, gDPP-TTVTT also shows high electronic charge mobility in a field-effect transistor, suggesting efficient ion injection/diffusion without hindering its efficient electronic charge transport. The elongated donor unit (TTVTT) facilitates hole polaron formation to be more localized to the donor unit, leading to faster and easier polaron formation with less impact on polymer structure during OECT operation, as opposed to the TTT unit. This is supported by molecular dynamics simulation. These simultaneously high electronic and ionic charge-transport properties are achieved due to the long-alkyl-group spacer in amphipathic sidechains, providing an important molecular design rule for glycolated copolymers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Visualizing Atomically Layered Magnetism in CrSBr</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
CrSBr is a layered material possessing intralayer ferromagnetic and interlayer antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering at low temperatures (T&#160;&lt;&#160;132&#160;K). At higher temperatures or in the presence of modest magnetic fields, AFM correlations are suppressed, yielding a magnetic phase with a comparatively high sheet susceptibility (&#967;2D). Magnetic force microscopy is sensitive to &#967;2D and identifies local nanoscale magnetic ordering.








Abstract
2D materials can host long&#8208;range magnetic order in the presence of underlying magnetic anisotropy. The ability to realize the full potential of 2D magnets necessitates systematic investigation of the role of individual atomic layers and nanoscale inhomogeneity (i.e., strain) on the emergence of stable magnetic phases. Here, spatially dependent magnetism in few&#8208;layer CrSBr is revealed using magnetic force microscopy (MFM) and Monte Carlo&#8208;based simulations. Nanoscale visualization of the magnetic sheet susceptibility is extracted from MFM data and force&#8211;distance curves, revealing a characteristic onset of both intra&#8208; and interlayer magnetic correlations as a function of temperature and layer&#8208;thickness. These results demonstrate that the presence of a single uncompensated layer in odd&#8208;layer terraces significantly reduces the stability of the low&#8208;temperature antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase and gives rise to multiple coexisting magnetic ground states at temperatures close to the bulk N&#233;el temperature (TN). Furthermore, the AFM phase can be reliably suppressed using modest fields (&#8776;16 mT) from the MFM probe, behaving as a nanoscale magnetic switch. This prototypical study of few&#8208;layer CrSBr demonstrates the critical role of layer parity on field&#8208;tunable 2D magnetism and validates MFM for use in nanomagnetometry of 2D materials (despite the ubiquitous absence of bulk zero&#8208;field magnetism in magnetized sheets).

         <title>Enabling 100C Fast&#8208;Charging Bulk Bi Anodes for Na&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the difficulty in simultaneously achieving a large capacity, ultrafast charging capability, and long cycling stability in a battery anode, a bulk Bi anode is presented for Na&#8208;ion batteries that provides a simple yet practical route&#160;to address this issue without using expensive nanoscale materials and additional complex modifications.








Abstract
It is challenging to develop alloying anodes with ultrafast charging and large energy storage using bulk anode materials because of the difficulty of carrier&#8208;ion diffusion and fragmentation of the active electrode material. Herein, a rational strategy is reported to design bulk Bi anodes for Na&#8208;ion batteries that feature ultrafast charging, long cyclability, and large energy storage without using expensive nanomaterials and surface modifications. It is found that bulk Bi particles gradually transform into a porous nanostructure during cycling in a glyme&#8208;based electrolyte, whereas the resultant structure stores Na ions by forming phases with high Na diffusivity. These features allow the anodes to exhibit unprecedented electrochemical properties; the developed Na&#8211;Bi half&#8208;cell delivers 379&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 (97% of that measured at 1C) at 7.7&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 (20C) during 3500 cycles. It also retained 94% and 93% of the capacity measured at 1C even at extremely fast&#8208;charging rates of 80C and 100C, respectively. The structural origins of the measured properties are verified by experiments and first&#8208;principles calculations. The findings of this study not only broaden understanding of the underlying mechanisms of fast&#8208;charging anodes, but also provide basic guidelines for searching battery anodes that simultaneously exhibit high capacities, fast kinetics, and long cycling stabilities.

         <title>Dual Self&#8208;Built Gating Boosts the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A design strategy, namely &#8220;dual self&#8208;built gating&#8221; is reported to boost the hydrogen evolution reaction. Taking ReS2 and WS2 as an example, dual self&#8208;built gating induces electrons from WS2 to ReS2 directionally. The tailored electronic structure can balance the adsorption of intermediates and the desorption of hydrogen synergistically, thus greatly promoting the intrinsic activity of the active sites.








Abstract
Optimizing the intrinsic activity of active sites is an appealing strategy for accelerating the kinetics of the catalytic process. Here, a design principle, namely &#8220;dual self&#8208;built gating&#8221;, is proposed to tailor the electronic structures of catalysts. Catalytic improvement is confirmed in a model catalyst with a ReS2&#8211;WS2/WS2 hybridized heterostructure. As demonstrated in experimental and theoretical results, the dual gating can bidirectionally guide electron transfer and redistribute at the interface, endowing the model catalyst with an electron&#8208;rich region. The tailored electronic structures balance the adsorption of intermediates and the desorption of hydrogen synergistically to enhance the reaction kinetics for the hydrogen evolution reaction. Interestingly, the effect of dual gating can be easily amplified by the electric field. The overpotential and Tafel slope (49&#160;mV, 35&#160;mV dec&#8722;1) obtained under the electric field for ReS2&#8211;WS2/WS2 catalyst with the dual self&#8208;built gating effect are far below than those (210&#160;mV, 116&#160;mV dec&#8722;1) of the pure WS2 catalyst, which exhibits nearly four times improvement. The concept of dual gating can be applied to more systems, offering a new guideline for designing advanced electrocatalysts.

         <title>Engineered Nanoerythrocytes Alleviate Central Nervous System Inflammation by Regulating the Polarization of Inflammatory Microglia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microglia are the main regulator of inflammatory response in ischemic stroke and multiple sclerosis. An engineered nanoerythrocyte immunosuppressive platform is developed for precise targeting and efficient reprogramming of M1 microglia. The regulation of microglia function, protection of the blood&#8211;brain barrier, and neurons are realized through upregulation of heme oxygenase&#8208;1 and reinforcement by intrinsic metabolism to generate anti&#8208;inflammatory substances CO and bilirubin.








Abstract
Microglial polarization is one of the most promising therapeutic strategies for multiple central nervous system (CNS) disorders. However, safe, effective, and controllable microglial regulation still faces formidable challenges. Although some anti&#8208;inflammatory factors promote microglia polarization, their short half&#8208;life, high cost, unpredictable in vivo behavior, and complex delivery operations, hamper their clinical application. Here, inspired by the natural microhemorrhage cleaning mechanism, an MG1 peptide and RVG29 peptide engineered nanoerythrocyte (NEMR) that can reprogram microglia are developed from classical M1 toward alternative M2 by inducing heme oxygenase&#8208;1 (HO&#8208;1), stimulating Notch1/Hes1/Stat3 signaling, and further inhibiting NF&#8208;&#954;B p65 translocation. Moreover, anti&#8208;inflammatory carbon monoxide (CO) and bilirubin produced by endogenous metabolism of heme further reinforces the anti&#8208;inflammatory effect. In middle cerebral artery occlusion and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis models, a satisfactory prognosis is achieved, with precise regulation of inflammatory microglia in lesion sites, increased expression of anti&#8208;inflammatory factors, reduced blood&#8211;brain barrier permeability, as well as promotion of neurogenesis and functional recovery. Furthermore, NEMR can be integrated with clinical therapeutic agents, which facilitates precise drug delivery to enhance therapeutic effects. Hence, the natural nanoerythrocytes, as a feasible, efficient, safe, and practical tool, provides a new strategy for rebalancing of the immune environment in the CNS disorders.

In middle cerebral artery occlusion and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis models, a satisfactory prognosis is achieved, with precise regulation of inflammatory microglia in lesion sites, increased expression of anti-inflammatory factors, reduced blood&#8211;brain barrier permeability, as well as promotion of neurogenesis and functional recovery. Furthermore, NEMR can be integrated with clinical therapeutic agents, which facilitates precise drug delivery to enhance therapeutic effects. Hence, the natural nanoerythrocytes, as a feasible, efficient, safe, and practical tool, provides a new strategy for rebalancing of the immune environment in the CNS disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unraveling Thermodynamic and Kinetic Contributions to the Stability of Doped Nanocrystalline Alloys using Nanometallic Multilayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guided by modeling informed selection of the Mo&#8211;Au system, evolving grain boundary segregation behavior is explored through in situ electron microscopy thermal aging experiments on nanometallic multilayers. Isolation of the underlying stability mechanisms is accomplished by mapping the Au distribution with temperature, which, through comparison with thermodynamic predictions, collectively demonstrates the segregation states responsible for temperature&#8208;dependent stability transitions.








Abstract
Targeted doping of grain boundaries is widely pursued as a pathway for combating thermal instabilities in nanocrystalline metals. However, certain dopants predicted to produce grain&#8208;boundary&#8208;segregated nanocrystalline configurations instead form small nanoprecipitates at elevated temperatures that act to kinetically inhibit grain growth. Here, thermodynamic modeling is implemented to select the Mo&#8211;Au system for exploring the interplay between thermodynamic and kinetic contributions to nanostructure stability. Using nanoscale multilayers and in situ transmission electron microscopy thermal aging, evolving segregation states and the corresponding phase transitions are mapped with temperature. The microstructure is shown to evolve through a transformation at lower homologous temperatures (&lt;600&#160;&#176;C) where solute atoms cluster and segregate to the grain boundaries, consistent with predictions from thermodynamic models. An increase in temperature to 800&#160;&#176;C is accompanied by coarsening of the grain structure via grain boundary migration but with multiple pinning events uncovered between migrating segments of the grain boundary and local solute clustering. Direct comparison between the thermodynamic predictions and experimental observations of microstructure evolution thus demonstrates a transition from thermodynamically preferred to kinetically inhibited nanocrystalline stability and provides a general framework for decoupling contributions to complex stability transitions while simultaneously targeting a dominant thermal stability regime.

         <title>Stable Zinc Anodes Enabled by a Zincophilic Polyanionic Hydrogel Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique polyanionic hydrogel is employed as an artificial protective layer for reversible Zn&#8208;metal anodes. The polyanions in the hydrogel framework facilitate a homogeneous zinc&#8208;ion flux, and the Zn&#8211;O bonding strengthens the interface and suppresses surface corrosion and irregular Zn dendrites growth. This strategy could apply also to other aqueous metal batteries.








Abstract
The practical application of the Zn&#8208;metal anode for aqueous batteries is greatly restricted by catastrophic dendrite growth, intricate hydrogen evolution, and parasitic surface passivation. Herein, a polyanionic hydrogel film is introduced as a protective layer on the Zn anode with the assistance of a silane coupling agent (denoted as Zn&#8211;SHn). The hydrogel framework with zincophilic &#8211;SO3&#8722; functional groups uniformizes the zinc ions flux and transport. Furthermore, such a hydrogel layer chemically bonded on the Zn surface possesses an anti&#8208;catalysis effect, which effectively suppresses both the hydrogen evolution reaction and formation of Zn dendrites. As a result, stable and reversible Zn stripping/plating at various currents and capacities is achieved. A full cell by pairing the Zn&#8211;SHn anode with a NaV3O8&#183;1.5 H2O cathode shows a capacity of around 176 mAh g&#8722;1 with a retention around 67% over 4000 cycles at 10 A g&#8722;1. This polyanionic hydrogel film protection strategy paves a new way for future Zn&#8208;anode design and safe aqueous batteries construction.

         <title>A Vinylene&#8208;Linker&#8208;Based Polymer Acceptor Featuring a Coplanar and Rigid Molecular Conformation Enables High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells with Over 17% Efficiency</title>

         <dc:description>
A vinylene&#8208;linker&#8208;based polymer acceptor (PY&#8208;V&#8208;&#947;) with rigid and coplanar chain conformations is synthesized, exhibiting redshifted absorption and ordered packing. When employed in all&#8208;polymer solar cells, the PY&#8208;V&#8208;&#947;&#8208;based devices yield a higher efficiency of 17.1% than PY&#8208;T&#8208;&#947;&#8208; and PY&#8208;2T&#8208;&#947;&#8208;based ones and exhibit robust mechanical stability in flexible devices, suggesting the potential for commercial application.








Abstract
State&#8208;of&#8208;art Y&#8208;series polymer acceptors are typically based on a mono&#8208;thiophene linker, which can cause some twisted molecular conformations and thus limit the performance of all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs). Here, a high&#8208;performance polymer acceptor based on vinylene linkers is reported, which leads to surprising changes in the polymers&#8217; molecular conformations, optoelectronic properties, and enhanced photovoltaic performance. It is found that the polymer acceptors based on thiophene or bithiophene linkers (PY&#8208;T&#8208;&#947; and PY&#8208;2T&#8208;&#947;) display significant molecular twisting between end&#8208;groups and linker units, while the vinylene&#8208;based polymer (PY&#8208;V&#8208;&#947;) exhibits a more coplanar and rigid molecular conformation. As a result, PY&#8208;V&#8208;&#947; demonstrates a better conjugation and tighter interchain stacking, which results in higher mobility and a reduced energetic disorder. Furthermore, detailed morphology investigations reveal that the PY&#8208;V&#8208;&#947;&#8208;based blend exhibits high domain purity and thus a better fill factor in its all&#8208;PSCs. With these, a higher efficiency of 17.1% is achieved in PY&#8208;V&#8208;&#947;&#8208;based all&#8208;PSCs, which is the highest efficiency reported for binary all&#8208;PSCs to date. This work demonstrates that the vinylene&#8208;linker is a superior unit to build polymer acceptors with more coplanar and rigid chain conformation, which is beneficial for polymer aggregation and efficient all&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Sr&#8208;Doped Superionic Hydrogen Glass: Synthesis and Properties of SrH22</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under high pressure, strontium reacts with hydrogen forming molecular SrH22&#8212;a yellow&#8208;orange semiconductor with the bandgap of &#8776;1.8&#160;eV. SrH22 has a glassy superionic hydrogen sublattice stabilized by a solid framework of Sr atoms. The formation of hydrogen glass is a new phenomenon that may have a significant impact on the development of new materials for hydrogen storage and high&#8208;pressure electrochemistry.








Abstract
Recently, several research groups announced reaching the point of metallization of hydrogen above 400&#160;GPa. Despite notable progress, detecting superconductivity in compressed hydrogen remains an unsolved problem. Following the mainstream of extensive investigations of compressed metal polyhydrides, here small doping of molecular hydrogen by strontium is demonstrated to lead to a dramatic reduction in the metallization pressure to &#8776;200&#160;GPa. Studying the high&#8208;pressure chemistry of the Sr&#8211;H system, the formation of several new phases is observed: C2/m&#8208;Sr3H13, pseudocubic SrH6, SrH9 with cubic F4&#175;3m$F\bar{4}3m$&#8208;Sr sublattice, and pseudo tetragonal superionic P1&#8208;SrH22, the metal hydride with the highest hydrogen content (96 at%) discovered so far. High diffusion coefficients of hydrogen in the latter phase DH&#160;= 0.2&#8211;2.1 &#215; 10&#8722;9 m2 s&#8722;1 indicate an amorphous state of the H&#8208;sublattice, whereas the strontium sublattice remains solid. Unlike Ca and Y, strontium forms molecular semiconducting polyhydrides, whereas calcium and yttrium polyhydrides are high&#8208;TC superconductors with an atomic H sublattice. The discovered SrH22, a kind of hydrogen sponge, opens a new class of materials with ultrahigh content of hydrogen.

         <title>A New Polystyrene&#8211;Poly(vinylpyridinium) Ionic Copolymer Dopant for n&#8208;Type All&#8208;Polymer Thermoelectrics with High and Stable Conductivity Relative to the Seebeck Coefficient giving High Power Factor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel polystyrene&#8211;poly(vinylpyridinium)&#8208;based n&#8208;type polymer dopant is designed and synthesized. It can dope n&#8208;type conjugated polymers to make n&#8208;type all&#8208;polymer conducting materials and thermoelectrics, analogous to poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(4&#8208;styrenesulfonate). An electron conductivity of 4.2 S cm&#8211;1, mobility of 0.86 cm2 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1 and power factor of 67 &#181;W m&#8211;1 K&#8211;2 are achieved.








Abstract
A novel n&#8208;type copolymer dopant polystyrene&#8211;poly(4&#8208;vinyl&#8208;N&#8208;hexylpyridinium fluoride) (PSpF) with fluoride anions is designed and synthesized by reversible addition&#8211;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. This is thought to be the first polymeric fluoride dopant. Electrical conductivity of 4.2 S cm&#8211;1 and high power factor of 67 &#181;W m&#8211;1 K&#8211;2 are achieved for PSpF&#8208;doped polymer films, with a corresponding decrease in thermal conductivity as the PSpF concentration is increased, giving the highest ZT of 0.1. An especially high electrical conductivity of 58 S cm&#8211;1 at 88&#160;&#176;C and outstanding thermal stability are recorded. Further, organic transistors of PSpF&#8208;doped thin films exhibit high electron mobility and Hall mobility of 0.86 and 1.70 cm2 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1, respectively. The results suggest that polystyrene&#8211;poly(vinylpyridinium) salt copolymers with fluoride anions are promising for high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type all&#8208;polymer thermoelectrics. This work provides a new way to realize organic thermoelectrics with high conductivity relative to the Seebeck coefficient, high power factor, thermal stability, and broad processing window.

Cell Adhesion
In article number 2110340, Ramasamy Paulmurugan, Young Keun Kim, Heemin Kang, and co&#8208;workers report template&#8208;mediated in situ tuning of nanoligand size and spacing. They demonstrate that submolecular ligand spacing and magnetic ligand anchoring facilitate adhesion&#8208;structure assembly&#8208;mediated pro&#8208;healing polarization of host macrophages. Increasing the ligand spacing significantly suppresses macrophage adhesion whereas increasing both ligand size and spacing slightly inhibits it.

Ex&#8208;Solution Catalysts
In article number 2201109, WooChul Jung, Il&#8208;Doo Kim, and co&#8208;workers reconceptualize the ex&#8208;solution process with the design of a host oxide structure using a metal&#8211;organic framework as an oxide precursor. The critical challenges of ex&#8208;solution, which emerge through conventional synthesis methods, are addressed all at once through this strategy. The ex&#8208;solved nanoparticles promote oxygen chemisorption and function as primary active sites for acetone oxidation reactions in an example process, attaining record&#8208;breaking performance in acetone oxidation and acetone&#8208;detection reactions.

Pixelated Soft Materials
In article number 2109682, P.&#8208;T. Brun and co&#8208;workers demonstrate a robust and predictive approach for the passive assembly of pixelated soft materials. They harness capillary suction in curable elastomers that self&#8208;assemble into complex tessellation patterns before they cure. The resulting pixelated films are highly modular and can be designed to possess localized material properties.

Nanoporous Materials
In article number 2201502, David Fairen&#8208;Jimenez and co&#8208;workers conduct a round&#8208;robin exercise by providing 18 already&#8208;measured adsorption isotherms to sixty&#8208;one labs and show that the reproducibility of the Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller (BET) area determination in micro&#8208; and mesoporous materials remains a largely ignored issue. To solve this, a new computational approach&#8212;called BETSI&#8212;that expands on the Rouquerol criteria and makes an unambiguous BET area assignment possible is developed.

Nanocrystalline Alloys
In article number 2200354, Jason Trelewicz and co&#8208;workers connect nanocrystalline stability regimes with temperature&#8208;dependent segregation states through in situ mapping of microstructural evolution in Mo&#8211;Au nanometallic multilayers combined with thermodynamic predictions of stable solute configurations. These findings provide a framework for decoupling thermodynamic and kinetic contributions to the stability of nanocrystalline alloys exhibiting a transition from grain&#8208;boundary segregation to solute clustering and nanophase separation at elevated temperatures.

         <title>Recent Advances in Intelligent Wearable Medical Devices Integrating Biosensing and Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intelligent wearable medical devices (IWMDs) are intensively investigated for personalized healthcare and smart therapy. Recent advances in wearable biosensing&#8722;delivery integrated therapeutic systems are summarized, with an emphasis on functional materials, responsiveness models, working mechanisms, and practices, to provide deep insights into the design, fabrication, and bioapplication of IWMDs.








Abstract
The primary roles of precision medicine are to perform real&#8208;time examination, administer on&#8208;demand medication, and apply instruments continuously. However, most current therapeutic systems implement these processes separately, leading to treatment interruption and limited recovery in patients. Personalized healthcare and smart medical treatment have greatly promoted research on and development of biosensing and drug&#8208;delivery integrated systems, with intelligent wearable medical devices (IWMDs) as typical systems, which have received increasing attention because of their non&#8208;invasive and customizable nature. Here, the latest progress in research on IWMDs is reviewed, including their mechanisms of integrating biosensing and on&#8208;demand drug delivery. The current challenges and future development directions of IWMDs are also discussed.

         <title>Advances in SnO2 for Efficient and Stable n&#8211;i&#8211;p Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the recent advances of SnO2&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and the related interface optimization strategies and applications. The fundamental properties of SnO2 are discussed, with a focus on the defect chemistry, and various preparation methods for improving SnO2 and SnO2/perovskite interface. Finally, the challenges and opportunities for further development of SnO2&#8208;based PSCs are provided.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on the regular n&#8211;i&#8211;p device architecture have reached above 25% certified efficiency with continuously reported improvements in recent years. A key common factor for these recent breakthroughs is the development of SnO2 as an effective electron transport layer in these devices. In this article, the key advances in SnO2 development are reviewed, including various deposition approaches and surface treatment strategies, to enhance the bulk and interface properties of SnO2 for highly efficient and stable n&#8211;i&#8211;p PSCs. In addition, the general materials chemistry associated with SnO2 along with the corresponding materials challenges and improvement strategies are discussed, focusing on defects, intrinsic properties, and impact on device characteristics. Finally, some SnO2 implementations related to scalable processes and flexible devices are highlighted, and perspectives on the future development of efficient and stable large&#8208;scale perovskite solar modules are also provided.

         <title>Programming Cellular Alignment in Engineered Cardiac Tissue via Bioprinting Anisotropic Organ Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aligned cardiac tissues are produced by 3D bioprinting a densely cellular ink composed of anisotropic organ building blocks (aOBBs). The aOBBs undergo shear&#8208;induced alignment along the print path when extruded through a tapered nozzle. This method enables programmable control over cardiac tissue alignment across multiple scales.








Abstract
The ability to replicate the 3D myocardial architecture found in human hearts is a grand challenge. Here, the fabrication of aligned cardiac tissues via bioprinting anisotropic organ building blocks (aOBBs) composed of human induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC&#8208;CMs) is reported. A bioink composed of contractile cardiac aOBBs is first generated and aligned cardiac tissue sheets with linear, spiral, and chevron features are printed. Next, aligned cardiac macrofilaments are printed, whose contractile force and conduction velocity increase over time and exceed the performance of spheroid&#8208;based cardiac tissues. Finally, the ability to spatially control the magnitude and direction of contractile force by printing cardiac sheets with different aOBB alignment is highlighted. This research opens new avenues to generating functional cardiac tissue with high cell density and complex cellular alignment.

         <title>Obstructed Surface States as the Descriptor for Predicting Catalytic Active Sites in Inorganic Crystalline Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsic obstructed surfaces states can be a descriptor for the fast and precise identification of catalytic active sites. High&#8208;performance catalysts can be predicted by simply counting the density of obstructed Wannier charge centers under the framework of classic d band theory.








Abstract
The discovery of new catalysts that are efficient and sustainable is a major research endeavor for many industrial chemical processes. This requires an understanding and determination of the catalytic origins, which remains a challenge. Here, a novel method to identify the position of active sites based on searching for crystalline symmetry&#8208;protected obstructed atomic insulators (OAIs) that have metallic surface states is described. The obstructed Wannier charge centers (OWCCs) in OAIs are pinned by symmetries at some empty Wyckoff positions so that surfaces that accommodate these sites are guaranteed to have metallic obstructed surface states (OSSs). It is proposed and confirmed that the OSSs are the catalytic activity origins for crystalline materials. The theory on 2H&#8208;MoTe2, 1T&#8242;&#8208;MoTe2, and NiPS3 bulk single crystals is verified, whose active sites are consistent with the calculations. Most importantly, several high&#8208;efficiency catalysts are successfully identified just by considering the number of OWCCs and the symmetry. Using the real&#8208;space&#8208;invariant theory applied to a database of 34 013 topologically trivial insulators, 1788 unique OAIs are identified, of which 465 are potential high&#8208;performance catalysts. The new methodology will facilitate and accelerate the discovery of new catalysts for a wide range of heterogeneous redox reactions.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes utilizing a Europium&#8208;Activated Calcium Oxide Phosphor with External Quantum Efficiency of up to 54.7%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photoluminescence quantum efficiency of a CaO:Eu NIR phosphor is significantly improved and stabilized at high temperature. By utilizing GeO2 decomposition, the oxygen vacancies in the CaO lattice are effectively repaired. A record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency of 54.7% at 740 nm is obtained with a thermal stability greatly improved from 57% to 90% at 125&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) luminescence materials with broadband emissions are necessary for the development of light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) based light sources. However, most known NIR&#8208;emitting materials are limited by their low external quantum efficiency. This work demonstrates how the photoluminescence quantum efficiency of europium&#8208;activated calcium oxide (CaO:Eu) NIR phosphor can be significantly improved and stabilized at operating temperatures of LEDs. A carbon paper wrapping technology is innovatively developed and used during the solid&#8208;state sintering to promote the reduction of Eu3+ into Eu2+. In parallel, the oxygen vacancies in the CaO lattice are repaired utilizing GeO2 decomposition. Through this process, a record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency of 54.7% at 740 nm is obtained with a thermal stability greatly improved from 57% to 90% at 125&#160;&#176;C. The as&#8208;fabricated NIR&#8208;LEDs reach record photoelectric efficiency (100 mA@23.4%) and output power (100 mA&#8202;@&#8202;319.5 mW). This discovery of high&#8208;performance phosphors will open new research avenues for broadband NIR LED light sources in a variety of photonics applications.

         <title>Reinforced Layered Double Hydroxide Oxygen&#8208;Evolution Electrocatalysts: A Polyoxometallic Acid Wet&#8208;Etching Approach and Synergistic Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multiskilled polyoxometallic acid etching approach to ingeniously reconstructing nickel&#8211;iron&#8208;based layered double hydroxides through morphology optimization, active site synergistic regulation, and defect regulation as a promising electrode post&#8208;treatment technique toward industrial anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane electrolyzer applications is reported.








Abstract
Nickel&#8211;iron&#8208;based layered double hydroxides (NiFe LDHs) have attracted tremendous research and industrial interests for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysis. However, methodologies on simultaneous regulation of performance&#8208;influencing factors remain scarce and their real synergistic effects are not clear enough. Herein, a versatile polyoxometallic acids (POMs) etching approach is reported to ingeniously reconstruct NiFe LDH, including 3D morphological nanotailoring, Fe3+ and &#945;&#8208;Ni(OH)2 active species reconfiguration, creation of multiple Ni, Fe, and O vacancies, and intercalation of POM polyanionic clusters. The experimental and theoretical data collaboratively unveil that control of the key performance&#8208;influencing factors and their multiple synergistic mechanisms dominantly contribute to the step&#8208;like OER performance enhancement. The reinforced electrocatalyst is further produced with low cost and high performance up to &#1060;180 mm in diameter, showing its feasibility and advancement of the promising configuration of NiFe LDH&#8208;PMo12(+) II Ni@NiFe LDH(&#8722;) for alkaline anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane electrode stack cells. Furthermore, to mathematically evaluate the evolution, a novel empirical formula is proposed for quantitative identification of structure&#8211;activity correlations, which offers an opportunity for first and fast reliability on materials screening.

         <title>Molybdenum Carbide Electrocatalyst In Situ Embedded in Porous Nitrogen&#8208;Rich Carbon Nanotubes Promotes Rapid Kinetics in Sodium&#8208;Metal&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The charge&#8208;storage kinetics of a sulfur&#8208;based sodium&#8208;metal battery are accelerated by incorporating highly redox&#8208;active MoC/Mo2C nanoparticles at the cathode. First&#8208;principle calculations shed fundamental insight on the source of this electrocatalytic enhancement. The resultant Na&#8211;S cells deliver among the most promising rate performance and cycling stabilities in the literature.








Abstract
This is the first report of molybdenum carbide&#8208;based electrocatalyst for sulfur&#8208;based sodium&#8208;metal batteries. MoC/Mo2C is in situ grown on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes in parallel with formation of extensive nanoporosity. Sulfur impregnation (50 wt%&#160;S)&#160;results in unique triphasic architecture termed molybdenum carbide&#8211;porous carbon nanotubes host (MoC/Mo2C@PCNT&#8211;S). Quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state phase transformation to Na2S is promoted in carbonate electrolyte, with in situ time&#8208;resolved Raman, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and optical analyses demonstrating minimal soluble polysulfides. MoC/Mo2C@PCNT&#8211;S cathodes deliver among the most promising rate performance characteristics in the literature, achieving 987 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1, 818 mAh g&#8722;1 at 3 A g&#8722;1, and 621 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 A g&#8722;1. The cells deliver superior cycling stability, retaining 650 mAh g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles at 1.5 A g&#8722;1, corresponding to 0.028% capacity decay per cycle. High mass loading cathodes (64 wt%&#160;S,&#160;12.7&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) also show cycling stability. Density functional theory demonstrates that formation energy of Na2Sx (1 &#8804; x&#160;&#8804; 4) on surface of MoC/Mo2C is significantly lowered compared to analogous redox in liquid. Strong binding of Na2Sx (1 &#8804; x&#160;&#8804; 4) on MoC/Mo2C surfaces results from charge transfer between the sulfur and Mo sites on carbides&#8217; surface.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first report of molybdenum carbide-based electrocatalyst for sulfur-based sodium-metal batteries. MoC/Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C is in situ grown on nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes in parallel with formation of extensive nanoporosity. Sulfur impregnation (50 wt%&#160;S)&#160;results in unique triphasic architecture termed molybdenum carbide&#8211;porous carbon nanotubes host (MoC/Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C@PCNT&#8211;S). Quasi-solid-state phase transformation to Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S is promoted in carbonate electrolyte, with in situ time-resolved Raman, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and optical analyses demonstrating minimal soluble polysulfides. MoC/Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C@PCNT&#8211;S cathodes deliver among the most promising rate performance characteristics in the literature, achieving 987 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 1 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, 818 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 3 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and 621 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 5 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The cells deliver superior cycling stability, retaining 650 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 1000 cycles at 1.5 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, corresponding to 0.028% capacity decay per cycle. High mass loading cathodes (64 wt%&#160;S,&#160;12.7&#160;mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) also show cycling stability. Density functional theory demonstrates that formation energy of Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; (1 &#8804; &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;&#160;&#8804; 4) on surface of MoC/Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C is significantly lowered compared to analogous redox in liquid. Strong binding of Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; (1 &#8804; &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;&#160;&#8804; 4) on MoC/Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C surfaces results from charge transfer between the sulfur and Mo sites on carbides&#8217; surface.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Optimally&#8208;Tailored Spinodal Architected Materials for Multiscale Design and Manufacturing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spinodal architected materials with tunable anisotropy directly target stiffness and lightweightness in optimal design and indirectly promote biological functions via microscale porosity and randomness. Their functional representation is also exploited for scalable multiscale manufacturing. As an example, a multiscale craniofacial implant is designed to support masticatory forces and microscale porosity is tailored upon manufacturing to promote bone regeneration and repair.








Abstract
Spinodal architected materials with tunable anisotropy unify optimal design and manufacturing of multiscale structures. By locally varying the spinodal class, orientation, and porosity during topology optimization, a large portion of the anisotropic material space is exploited such that material is efficiently placed along principal stress trajectories at the microscale. Additionally, the bicontinuous, nonperiodic, unstructured, and stochastic nature of spinodal architected materials promotes mechanical and biological functions not explicitly considered during optimization (e.g., insensitivity to imperfections, fluid transport conduits). Furthermore, in contrast to laminated composites or periodic, structured architected materials (e.g., lattices), the functional representation of spinodal architected materials leads to multiscale, optimized designs with clear physical interpretation that can be manufactured directly, without special treatment at spinodal transitions. Physical models of the optimized, spinodal&#8208;embedded parts are manufactured using a scalable, voxel&#8208;based strategy to communicate with a masked stereolithography (m&#8208;SLA) 3D&#160;printer.

         <title>Coupling Lipid Nanoparticle Structure and Automated Single&#8208;Particle Composition Analysis to Design Phospholipase&#8208;Responsive Nanocarriers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structured lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are characterized using Raman, X&#8208;ray, and neutron scattering to quantify the activity of the enzyme phospholipase D (PLD). Combining single&#8208;particle and bulk analysis for static and dynamic systems enables a label&#8208;free dynamic monitoring of PLD activity in LNPs. This demonstrates that particle structure drives the interaction of lipid nanocarriers with PLD.








Abstract
Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are versatile structures with tunable physicochemical properties that are ideally suited as a platform for vaccine delivery and RNA therapeutics. A key barrier to LNP rational design is the inability to relate composition and structure to intracellular processing and function. Here Single Particle Automated Raman Trapping Analysis (SPARTA) is combined with small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray and neutron scattering (SAXS/SANS) techniques to link LNP composition with internal structure and morphology and to monitor dynamic LNP&#8211;phospholipase D (PLD) interactions. This analysis demonstrates that PLD, a key intracellular trafficking mediator, can access the entire LNP lipid membrane to generate stable, anionic LNPs. PLD activity on vesicles with matched amounts of enzyme substrate is&#160;an order of magnitude lower, indicating that the LNP lipid membrane structure can be used to control enzyme interactions. This represents an opportunity to design enzyme&#8208;responsive LNP solutions for stimuli&#8208;responsive delivery and diseases where PLD is dysregulated.

         <title>Salt&#8208;Assisted 2H&#8208;to&#8208;1T&#8242; Phase Transformation of Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Common metal salts are used to realize the controlled phase transformation of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) from the conventional thermodynamically stable 2H phase to unconventional metastable 1T&#8242; phase. This work not only paves the way to prepare high&#8208;quality and high&#8208;purity unconventional metastable 1T&#8242;&#8208;TMDs for fundamental and practical investigations, but also greatly simplifies the procedure for the large&#8208;scale production of 1T&#8242;&#8208;TMDs.








Abstract
Phase engineering of nanomaterials (PEN) has demonstrated great potential in the fields of catalysis, electronics, energy storage and conversion, and condensed matter physics. Recently, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) with unconventional metastable phases (e.g., 1T and 1T&#8242;) have attracted increasing research interest due to their unique and appealing physicochemical properties. However, there is still a lack of a simple, universal, and controlled method for the preparation of large&#8208;scale and high&#8208;purity unconventional&#8208;phase TMD crystals, restricting their further fundamental study and practical applications. Here, a facile, one&#8208;step salt&#8208;assisted general strategy is reported for the controlled phase transformation of commercially available TMDs with conventional 2H phase, yielding a large amount of metastable 1T&#8242;&#8208;phase TMDs, including WS2, WSe2, MoS2, and MoSe2. It is found that the easily accessible metal salts, such as K2C2O4&#183;H2O, K2CO3, Na2CO3, Rb2CO3, Cs2CO3, KHCO3, NaHCO3, and NaC2O4, can be used to assist the 2H&#8208;to&#8208;1T&#8242; phase transformation, greatly simplifying the synthetic process for producing metastable 1T&#8242;&#8208;TMDs. Importantly, this method can also be used to prepare 1T&#8242;&#8208;TMD alloys, such as 1T&#8242;&#8208;WS2xSe2(1&#8722;x). This newly developed strategy is robust and highly effective, which can also be used for the phase engineering of other materials with various polymorphs.

         <title>Powering &#8776;50 &#181;m Motion by a Molecular Event in DNA Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>

A major challenge in material design is to translate molecular events to macroscale properties. In this work, self&#8208;assembled DNA crystals are shown to reversibly expand and contract over 50 &#956;m in response to versatile stimuli.








Abstract
A major challenge in material design is to couple nanoscale molecular and supramolecular events into desired chemical, physical, and mechanical properties at the macroscopic scale. Here, a novel self&#8208;assembled DNA crystal actuator is reported, which has reversible, directional expansion and contraction for over 50 &#956;m in response to versatile stimuli, including temperature, ionic strength, pH, and redox potential. The macroscopic actuation is powered by cooperative dissociation or cohesion of thousands of DNA sticky ends at the designed crystal contacts. The increase in crystal porosity and cavity in the expanded state dramatically enhances the crystal capability to accommodate/encapsulate nanoparticles/proteins, while the contraction enables a &#8220;sponge squeezing&#8221; motion for releasing nanoparticles. This crystal actuator is envisioned to be useful for a wide range of applications, including powering self&#8208;propelled robotics, sensing subtle environmental changes, constructing functional hybrid materials, and working in drug controlled&#8208;release systems.

This crystal actuator is envisioned to be useful for a wide range of applications, including powering self-propelled robotics, sensing subtle environmental changes, constructing functional hybrid materials, and working in drug controlled-release systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Catalytic Mechanism of Oxygen Vacancies in Perovskite Oxides for Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compared with the perovskite Sr0.9TiO3&#8722;&#948;, the perovskite Sr0.9Ti0.7Mn0.3O3&#8722;&#948; (STMn0.3) with a higher concentration of oxygen vacancies exhibits superior adsorptive&#8208;catalytic performance of lithium polysulfides, and improves the utilization of sulfur. The STMn0.3 battery still delivers a superior initial specific capacity of 780&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;and a decay rate of 0.032% per cycle after 1500&#160;cycles at 2 C, enabling a high&#8208;efficiency lithium&#8211;sulfur battery.








Abstract
Defective materials have been demonstrated to possess adsorptive and catalytic properties in lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries, which can effectively solve the problems of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) shuttle and sluggish conversion kinetics during charging and discharging of Li&#8211;S batteries. However, there is still a lack of research on the quantitative relationship between the defect concentration and the adsorptive&#8208;catalytic performance of the electrode. In this work, perovskites Sr0.9Ti1&#8722;xMnxO3&#8722;&#948; (STMnx) (x&#160;=&#160;0.1&#8211;0.3) with different oxygen&#8208;vacancy concentrations are quantitatively regulated as research models. Through a series of tests of the adsorptive property and electrochemical performance, a quantitative relationship between oxygen&#8208;vacancy concentration and adsorptive&#8208;catalytic properties is established. Furthermore, the catalytic mechanism of oxygen vacancies in Li&#8211;S batteries is investigated using density functional theory calculations and in&#160;situ experiments. The increased oxygen vacancies can effectively increase the binding energy between perovskite and LiPSs, reduce the energy barrier of LiPSs decomposition reaction, and promote LiPSs conversion reaction kinetics. Therefore, the perovskite STMn0.3&#160;with high oxygen&#8208;vacancy concentrations exhibits excellent LiPSs adsorptive and catalytic properties, realizing high&#8208;efficiency Li&#8211;S batteries. This work is helpful to realize the application of the quantitative regulation strategy of defect engineering in Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Effective Passivation with Self&#8208;Organized Molecules for Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small molecules with a planar molecular skeleton exhibit effective defect&#8208;passivation capability for perovskite photovoltaics, contributed by their ordered intermolecular arrangement and well&#8208;matched size with the perovskite lattice. The passivators spontaneously form a uniform passivation network adherent to the bottom surface of perovskite films during a top&#8208;down crystallization via liquid medium annealing, which enables the best device yield in&#8208;lab efficiency of 25.05%.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding 25% over the past decade and effective passivation for the interface with high trap density plays a significant role in this process. Here, two organic molecules are studied as passivators, and it is demonstrated that an advantageous molecular geometry and intermolecular ordering, aside from the functional moieties, are of great significance for effective and extensive passivation. Besides, the passivation molecules spontaneously form a uniform passivation network adjacent to the bottom surface of perovskite films during a top&#8208;down crystallization via liquid medium annealing, which greatly reduces defect&#8208;assisted recombination throughout the whole perovskite/SnO2 interface. The champion device yields an in&#8208;lab PCE of 25.05% (certified 24.39%). The investigation provides a more comprehensive understanding of passivation and a new avenue to achieve effective bottom&#8208;interface engineering for perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>Real&#8208;Space Crystal Structure Analysis by Low&#8208;Dose Focal&#8208;Series TEM Imaging of Organic Materials with Near&#8208;Atomic Resolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) methodology, low&#8208;dose focal&#8208;series reconstruction (LD&#8208;FSR), enables near&#8208;atomic resolution of 1.6 &#197;. This method allows the distinction between co&#8208;existing organic polymorphs, and observation of crystal defects and atoms. Moreover, a new copper phthalocyanine polymorph (&#955;&#8208;CuPc) is identified using LD&#8208;FSR, resulting in real&#8208;space crystal structure elucidation.








Abstract
Structural analysis of beam&#8208;sensitive materials by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) represents a significant challenge, as high&#8208;resolution TEM (HRTEM) requires high electron doses that limit its applicability to stable inorganic materials. Beam&#8208;sensitive materials, e.g., organic crystals, must be imaged under low dose conditions, leading to problematic contrast interpretation and loss of fine structural details. Here, HRTEM imaging of organic crystalline materials with near&#8208;atomic resolution of up to 1.6 &#197; is described, which enables real&#8208;space studies of crystal structures, as well as observation of co&#8208;existing polymorphs, crystal defects, and atoms. This is made possible by a low&#8208;dose focal&#8208;series reconstruction methodology, which provides HRTEM images where contrast reflects true object structure and can be performed on contemporary cryo&#8208;EM instruments available to many research institutions. Copper phthalocyanine (CuPc), a perchlorinated analogue of CuPc, and indigo crystalline films are imaged. In the case of indigo crystals, co&#8208;existing polymorphs and individual atoms (carbonyl oxygen) can be observed. In the case of CuPc, several polymorphs are observed, including a new one, for which the crystal structure is found based on direct in&#8208;focus imaging, accomplishing real&#8208;space crystal structure elucidation. Such direct analysis can be transformative for structure studies of organic materials.

         <title>Native Ligand Carbonization Renders Common Platinum Nanoparticles Highly Durable for Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction: Annealing Temperature Matters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Native surface ligands (e.g., oleylamine and oleic acid) attached to Pt nanoparticles during synthesis can be directly converted into ultrathin, conformal graphitic shells upon thermal annealing, rendering common Pt particles highly stable catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction. This in situ ligand carbonization strategy is general and can also be applied to improve the stability of commercial Pt/C catalysts.








Abstract
Current protocols for synthesizing monodisperse platinum (Pt) nanoparticles typically involve the use of hydrocarbon molecules as surface&#8208;capping ligands. Using Pt nanoparticles as catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), however, these ligands must be removed to expose surface sites. Here, highly durable ORR catalysts are realized without ligand removal; instead, the native ligands are converted into ultrathin, conformal graphitic shells by simple thermal annealing. Strikingly, the annealing temperature is a critical factor dictating the ORR performance of Pt catalysts. Pt nanoparticles treated at 500&#160;&#176;C show a very poor ORR activity, whereas those annealed at 700&#160;&#176;C become highly active along with exceptional stability. In&#8208;depth characterization reveals that thermal treatment from 500 to 700&#160;&#176;C gradually opens up the porosity in carbon shells through graphitization. Importantly, such graphitic&#8208;shell&#8208;coated Pt catalysts exhibit a superior ORR stability, largely retaining the activity after 20 000 cycles in a membrane electrode assembly. Moreover, this ligand carbonization strategy can be extended to modify commercial Pt/C catalysts with substantially enhanced stability. This work demonstrates the feasibility of boosting the ORR performance of common Pt nanoparticles by harnessing the native surface ligands, offering a robust approach of designing highly durable catalysts for proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cells.

         <title>Coupling Localized Laser Writing and Nonlocal Recrystallization in Perovskite Crystals for Reversible Multidimensional Optical Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Performing multifield modulation of coupled localized laser writing and nonlocal moisture treatment on metal halide perovskites crystals enables the creation and manipulation of localized photoluminescence for optical encryption from 2D to 3D and 4D, such as reversible encryption&#8211;reading, repeatable erasing&#8211;refreshing, and even spatially and temporally resolved reading with high resolution.








Abstract
The ability to generate and manipulate photoluminescence (PL) with high spatial resolution has been of primary importance for applications in micro&#8208;optoelectronics, while the emerging metal halide perovskites offer novel material platforms where diverse photonic functionalities and fine structuring are constantly explored. Herein, micro&#8208;PL patterns consisting of highly luminescent CsPbBr3 nanocrystals (NCs) in nonluminescent perovskite crystals are directly fabricated by focused femtosecond laser irradiation. Further modulation with a moisture field leads to the selective dissolution of the laser&#8208;destabilized perovskite structures as revealed by density functional theory simulations, thus allowing for facile control of the reversible PL from the recrystallization of moisture&#8208;induced CsPbBr3 NCs. By leveraging the coupled laser writing and moisture modulation, multimodal information encryption is realized by reversible encryption&#8211;reading and repeatable erasing&#8211;refreshing. This optical storage mechanism is also extended to 3D and 4D by realizing spatially and temporally resolved optical encryption. The coupled multifield modulation on perovskite crystals can enable potential applications in optical storage and encryption, and offer a novel solution for the creation and manipulation of localized PL structures with high temporal and spatial resolutions.

         <title>Preparation of Amorphous SnO2&#8208;Encapsulated Multiphased Crystalline Cu Heterostructures for Highly Efficient CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three types of Cu@SnO2 nanostructures with hemicapsule, yolk&#8211;shell, and core&#8211;shell architectures are synthesized, in which a series of unconventional phases of Cu (i.e., 2H, 4H, and 6H) is observed. The obtained hemicapsule heterostructures exhibit superior CO2 reduction reaction selectivity toward CO and formate with high Faradaic efficiency (above 90%) in a wide potential window, outperforming their yolk&#8211;shell and core&#8211;shell counterparts.








Abstract
Controlling the architectures and crystal phases of metal@semiconductor heterostructures is very important for modulating their physicochemical properties and enhancing their application performances. Here, a facile one&#8208;pot wet&#8208;chemical method to synthesize three types of amorphous SnO2&#8208;encapsulated crystalline Cu heterostructures, i.e., hemicapsule, yolk&#8211;shell, and core&#8211;shell nanostructures, in which unconventional crystal phases (e.g., 2H, 4H, and 6H) and defects (e.g., stacking faults and twin boundaries) are observed in the crystalline Cu cores, is reported. The hemicapsule Cu@SnO2 heterostructures, with voids that not only expose the Cu core with unconventional phases but also retain the interface between Cu and SnO2, show an excellent electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) selectivity toward the production of CO and formate with high Faradaic efficiency (FE) above 90% in a wide potential window from &#8722;1.05 to &#8722;1.55&#160;V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)), and the highest FE of CO2RR (95.3%) is obtained at &#8722;1.45&#160;V (vs RHE). This work opens up a new way for the synthesis of new heterostructured nanomaterials with promising catalytic application.

         <title>Universal Dynamic Liquid Interface for Healing Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal method of creating a dynamic healing interface (DHI) is launched by reinforcing the defective surface and grain boundaries of perovskite film with nonvolatile 2&#8208;bromonaphthalene (BN) with a low melting point of 53&#8211;58&#160;&#176;C. Different from static interfaces, the fluid characteristic originating from the easy solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid phase conversion of the DHI not only reinforces management of defect passivation and energetics modification, but also enables effective defect real&#8208;time self&#8208;healing. High efficiencies are thus achieved for popular PSCs up to 12.05% (CsPbIBr2), 14.14% (CsPbI2Br), and 23.37% (FA0.92MA0.08PbI3).








Abstract
Healing charge&#8208;selective contact interfaces in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) highly determines the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability. However, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategies are often static by one&#8208;off formation of a functional interlayer, which delivers fixed interfacial properties during the subsequent operation. As a result, defects formed in&#8208;service will gradually deteriorate the photovoltaic performances. Herein, a dynamic healing interface (DHI) is presented by incorporating a low&#8208;melting&#8208;point small molecule onto perovskite film surface for highly efficient and stable PSCs. Arising from the reduced non&#8208;radiative recombination, the DHI boosts the PCE to 12.05% for an all&#8208;inorganic CsPbIBr2 solar cell and 14.14% for a CsPbI2Br cell, as well as 23.37% for an FA0.92MA0.08PbI3 (FA = formamidinium, MA = methylammonium) cell. The solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid phase conversion of DHI at elevated temperature causes a longitudinal infiltration into the bulk perovskite film to maximize the charge extraction, passivate defects at grain boundaries, and suppress ion migration. Furthermore, the stability is remarkably enhanced under air, heat, and persistent light&#8208;irradiation conditions, paving a universal strategy for advanced perovskite&#8208;based optoelectronics.

         <title>Structural Phase Transitions between Layered Indium Selenide for Integrated Photonic Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition between two topologically similar layered structures in In2Se3 breaks the speed and energy limitations of photonic memory, via reversible nonvolatile refractive index change induced by a single nanosecond pulse. In this work, the atomistic phase&#8208;change pathway between the layered structures is unraveled with in situ high&#8208;energy X&#8208;ray diffraction and integrated photonic switching with a transferred epitaxial layer is demonstrated. Detailed analysis on the volumetric effect and by nonlinear spectroscopy are provided to harness the mode coupling and loss in the hybrid device.








Abstract
The primary mechanism of optical memoristive devices relies on phase transitions between amorphous and crystalline states. The slow or energy&#8208;hungry amorphous&#8211;crystalline transitions in optical phase&#8208;change materials are detrimental to the scalability and performance of devices. Leveraging an integrated photonic platform, nonvolatile and reversible switching between two layered structures of indium selenide (In2Se3) triggered by a single nanosecond pulse is demonstrated. The high&#8208;resolution pair distribution function reveals the detailed atomistic transition pathways between the layered structures. With interlayer &#8220;shear glide&#8221; and isosymmetric phase transition, switching between the &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;structural states contains low re&#8208;configurational entropy, allowing reversible switching between layered structures. Broadband refractive index contrast, optical transparency, and volumetric effect in the crystalline&#8211;crystalline phase transition are experimentally characterized in molecular&#8208;beam&#8208;epitaxy&#8208;grown thin films and compared to ab initio calculations. The nonlinear resonator transmission spectra measure of incremental linear loss rate of 3.3&#160;GHz, introduced by a 1.5&#160;&#181;m&#8208;long In2Se3&#8208;covered layer, resulted from the combinations of material absorption and scattering.

         <title>Dirac Fermion Cloning, Moir&#233; Flat Bands, and Magic Lattice Constants in Epitaxial Monolayer Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Periodic substrate modulation perturbs the electronic states of graphene, duplicates Dirac cones, and effectively couples the two valleys of the Dirac states in epitaxial monolayer graphene. The intervalley interaction is controlled by the substrate lattice constant. Moir&#233; flat bands emerge at certain magic values of the substrate lattice constant.








Abstract
Tuning interactions between Dirac states in graphene has attracted enormous interest because it can modify the electronic spectrum of the 2D material, enhance electron correlations, and give rise to novel condensed&#8208;matter phases such as superconductors, Mott insulators, Wigner crystals, and quantum anomalous Hall insulators. Previous works predominantly focus on the flat band dispersion of coupled Dirac states from different twisted graphene layers. In this work, a new route to realizing flat band physics in monolayer graphene under a periodic modulation from substrates is proposed. Graphene/SiC heterostructure is taken as a prototypical example and it is demonstrated experimentally that the substrate modulation leads to Dirac fermion cloning and, consequently, the proximity of the two Dirac cones of monolayer graphene in momentum space. Theoretical modeling captures the cloning mechanism of the Dirac states and indicates that moir&#233; flat bands can emerge at certain magic lattice constants of the substrate, specifically when the period of modulation becomes nearly commensurate with the (3&#8201;&#215;&#8201;3)R30o\[(\sqrt 3 \; \times \;\sqrt 3 )R{30^o}\] supercell of graphene. The results show that epitaxial single monolayer graphene on suitable substrates is a promising platform for exploring exotic many&#8208;body quantum phases arising from interactions between Dirac&#160;electrons.&#160;

         <title>Van der Waals Exfoliation Processed Biopiezoelectric Submucosa Ultrathin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A van der Waals exfoliation (vdWE) method to fabricate ultrathin films down to the thickness of effective piezoelectric domains is presented. The vdWE method facilitates the detection of piezoelectricity and make the application of piezoelectric biological tissues possible. The vdWE&#8208;processed SIS (small intestinal submucosa) ultrathin film reaches the thickness of 100 nm and exhibits enhanced piezoelectricity.








Abstract
Piezoelectric biomaterials have attracted significant attention due to the potential effect of piezoelectricity on biological tissues and their versatile applications. However, the high cost and complexity of assembling and domain aligning biomolecules at a large scale, and the disordered arrangement of piezoelectric domains as well as the lack of ferroelectricity in natural biological tissues remain a roadblock toward practical applications. Here, utilizing the weak van der Waals interaction in the layered structure of small intestinal submucosa (SIS), a van der Waals exfoliation (vdWE) process is reported to fabricate ultrathin films down to the thickness of the effective piezoelectric domain. Based on that, the piezoelectric property is revealed of SIS stemming from the collagen fibril, with piezoelectric coefficients up to 4.1 pm V&#8722;1 and in&#8208;plane polarization orientation parallel to the fibril axis. Furthermore, a biosensor based on the vdWE&#8208;processed SIS film with an in&#8208;plane electrode is demonstrated that produces open&#8208;circuit voltages of &#8776;250&#160;mV under the cantilever vibration condition. The vdWE method shows great potential in facilely fabricating ultrathin films of soft tissues and biosensors.

         <title>Strain Modulation for Light&#8208;Stable n&#8211;i&#8211;p Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strain modulation strategy to constrain phase segregation in a wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite absorber by reinforcing the energy barrier for ion migration is reported. With compressive strain, the single&#8208;junction devices yield one of smallest voltage deficits of 440 mV. Moreover, the resulting perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells achieve a champion efficiency of 26.95% with improved light stability at open&#8208;circuit.








Abstract
Perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells are promising to penetrate photovoltaic market. However, the wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite absorbers used in top&#8208;cell often suffer severe phase segregation under illumination, which restricts the operation lifetime of tandem solar cells. Here, a strain modulation strategy to fabricate light&#8208;stable perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells is reported. By employing adenosine triphosphate, the residual tensile strain in the wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite absorber is successfully converted to compressive strain, which mitigates light&#8208;induced ion migration and phase segregation. Based on the wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite with compressive strain, single&#8208;junction solar cells with the n&#8211;i&#8211;p layout yield a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.53% with the smallest voltage deficits of 440&#160;mV. These cells also maintain 83.60% of initial PCE after 2500 h operation at the maximum power point. Finally, these top cells are integrated with silicon bottom cells in a monolithic tandem device, which achieves a PCE of 26.95% and improved light stability at open&#8208;circuit.

         <title>Studying Complex Evolution of Hyperelastic Materials under External Field Stimuli using Artificial Neural Networks with Spatiotemporal Features in a Small&#8208;Scale Dataset</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonlinear mechanical properties of hyperelastic materials can be viewed as responses of materials to external serial stimuli. A convolutional bidirectional long short&#8208;term memory (CBLSTM) model with spatiotemporal features is used to capture the complex evolution of structures and properties of materials under external field stimuli and to design materials with excellent performance via taking full advantage of data information even in a small&#8208;scale dataset.








Abstract
Deep&#8208;learning (DL) methods, in consideration of their excellence in dealing with highly complex structure&#8211;performance relationships for materials, are expected to become a new design paradigm for breakthroughs in material performance. However, in most cases, it is impractical to collect massive&#8208;scale experimental data or open&#8208;source theoretical databases to support training DL models with sufficient prediction accuracy. In a dataset consisting of 483 porous silicone rubber observations generated via ink&#8208;writing additive manufacturing, this work demonstrates that constructing low&#8208;dimensional, accurate descriptors is the prerequisite for obtaining high&#8208;precision DL models based on small experimental datasets. On this basis, a unique convolutional bidirectional long short&#8208;term memory model with spatiotemporal features extraction capability is designed, whose hierarchical learning mechanism further reduces the requirement for the amount of data by taking full advantage of data information. The proposed approach can be expected as a powerful tool for innovative material design on small experimental datasets, which can also be used to explore the evolutionary mechanisms of the structures and properties of materials under complex working conditions.

         <title>Identification of the Stable Pt Single Sites in the Environment of Ions: From Mechanism to Design Principle</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two kinds of Pt sites, Ptzn&#8208;sub&#8208;S3 and Ptads&#8208;S2 are identified on Pt SA&#8208;Zn0.5Cd0.5S (Pt SA&#8208;ZCS), and interesting phenomena are observed and analyzed, facing the Brownian collision of ions in the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution process, which further inspires the design of novel composite with enhanced activity.








Abstract
For single&#8208;atom (SA)&#8208;based catalysis, it is urgent to understand the nature and dynamic evolution of SA active sites during the reactions. In this work, an example of Pt SA&#8208;Zn0.5Cd0.5S (Pt SA&#8208;ZCS) is found to display interesting phenomena when facing the Brownian collision of ions in aqueous photocatalysis. Via synchrotron radiation, surface techniques, microscopy, and theory calculations, the results show that two kinds of Pt sites exist: PtZn&#8208;sub&#8208;S3 (Pt substituting the Zn site) and Ptads&#8208;S2 (Pt adsorbing on the surface). In Na2S, the S2&#8722; can coordinate with Pt atoms and peel them from the Ptads&#8208;S2 sites, but leaves more stable PtZn&#8208;sub&#8208;S3 sites, bringing a low but stable catalytic activity (19.40&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). Meanwhile, in ascorbic acid, the ascorbic acid ions show less complex ability with Pt atoms, but can decrease the migration barrier of Ptads&#8208;S2 sites (67.18 down to 35.96&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, 52.03% drop after 6 h).

&lt;p&gt;Two kinds of Pt sites, Pt&lt;sub&gt;zn-sub&lt;/sub&gt;-S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and Pt&lt;sub&gt;ads&lt;/sub&gt;-S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are identified on Pt SA-Zn&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Cd&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;S (Pt SA-ZCS), and interesting phenomena are observed and analyzed, facing the Brownian collision of ions in the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution process, which further inspires the design of novel composite with enhanced activity.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For single-atom (SA)-based catalysis, it is urgent to understand the nature and dynamic evolution of SA active sites during the reactions. In this work, an example of Pt SA-Zn&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Cd&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;S (Pt SA-ZCS) is found to display interesting phenomena when facing the Brownian collision of ions in aqueous photocatalysis. Via synchrotron radiation, surface techniques, microscopy, and theory calculations, the results show that two kinds of Pt sites exist: Pt&lt;sub&gt;Zn-sub&lt;/sub&gt;-S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (Pt substituting the Zn site) and Pt&lt;sub&gt;ads&lt;/sub&gt;-S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (Pt adsorbing on the surface). In Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, the S&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; can coordinate with Pt atoms and peel them from the Pt&lt;sub&gt;ads&lt;/sub&gt;-S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sites, but leaves more stable Pt&lt;sub&gt;Zn-sub&lt;/sub&gt;-S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; sites, bringing a low but stable catalytic activity (19.40&#160;mmol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). Meanwhile, in ascorbic acid, the ascorbic acid ions show less complex ability with Pt atoms, but can decrease the migration barrier of Pt&lt;sub&gt;ads&lt;/sub&gt;-S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sites (67.18 down to 35.96&#160;mmol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, 52.03% drop after 6 h). Therefore, the Pt&lt;sub&gt;ads&lt;/sub&gt;-S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sites gradually aggregate into nanoclusters, bringing a high but decayed catalytic activity. Moreover, a Pt SA-ZCS-Sulfur composite is designed mainly covered by Pt&lt;sub&gt;Zn-sub&lt;/sub&gt;-S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; sites accordingly (max: 79.09&#160;mmol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, 5% drop after 6 h and QE: 14.0% at 420&#160;nm), showing a beneficial strategy &#8220;from mechanism to design principle.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Magnetic&#8208;Powered Janus Cell Robots Loaded with Oncolytic Adenovirus for Active and Targeted Virotherapy of Bladder Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Janus oncolytic adenovirus&#8208;loaded 293T cell robots with full coating of targeted peptides and Janus modification of magnetic nanoparticles are capable of controllable magnetic propulsion and tumor&#8208;specific binding and killing. Such active medical platform with enhanced tissue retention and penetration shows the highest therapeutic efficacy in treating orthoptic mice bladder cancer models with minimized damage to normal tissues.








Abstract
A unique robotic medical platform is designed by utilizing cell robots as the active &#8220;Trojan horse&#8221; of oncolytic adenovirus (OA), capable of tumor&#8208;selective binding and killing. The OA&#8208;loaded cell robots are fabricated by entirely modifying OA&#8208;infected 293T cells with cyclic arginine&#8211;glycine&#8211;aspartic acid tripeptide (cRGD) to specifically bind with bladder cancer cells, followed by asymmetric immobilization of Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) on the cell surface. OA can replicate in host cells and induce cytolysis to release the virus progeny to the surrounding tumor sites for sustainable infection and oncolysis. The asymmetric coating of magnetic NPs bestows the cell robots with effective movement in various media and wireless manipulation with directional migration in a microfluidic device and bladder mold under magnetic control, further enabling steerable movement and prolonged retention of cell robots in the mouse bladder. The biorecognition of cRGD and robust, controllable propulsion of cell robots work synergistically to greatly enhance their tissue penetration and anticancer efficacy in the 3D cancer spheroid and orthotopic mouse bladder tumor model. Overall, this study integrates cell&#8208;based microrobots with virotherapy to generate an attractive robotic system with tumor specificity, expanding the operation scope of cell robots in biomedical community.

         <title>Stable Universal 1&#8208; and 2&#8208;Input Single&#8208;Molecule Logic Gates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;molecule logic devices are ideal candidates for ultra&#8208;minimalistic circuit elements to perform high&#8208;density computing. Gated Au/S&#8208;(CH2)3&#8208;Fc&#8208;(CH2)9&#8208;S/Au single&#8208;electron transistors not only hold the advantage of controlling molecular orbitals (MOs) via bias and gate voltages, but also exhibit a unique electronic structure with two adjacent MOs. This provides a single&#8208;electron logic calculator to implement all universal logic gates within a single&#8208;molecule device.








Abstract
Controllable single&#8208;molecule logic operations will enable development of reliable ultra&#8208;minimalistic circuit elements for high&#8208;density computing but require stable currents from multiple orthogonal inputs in molecular junctions. Utilizing the two unique adjacent conductive molecular orbitals (MOs) of gated Au/S&#8208;(CH2)3&#8208;Fc&#8208;(CH2)9&#8208;S/Au (Fc = ferrocene) single&#8208;electron transistors (&#8776;2&#160;nm), a stable single&#8208;electron logic calculator (SELC) is presented, which allows real&#8208;time modulation of output current as a function of orthogonal input bias (Vb) and gate (Vg) voltages. Reliable and low&#8208;voltage (&#448;Vb&#448; &#8804; 80&#160;mV, &#448;Vg&#448; &#8804; 2&#160;V) operations of the SELC depend upon the unambiguous association of current resonances with energy shifts of the MOs (which show an invariable, small energy separation of &#8776;100 meV) in response to the changes of voltages, which is confirmed by electron&#8208;transport calculations. Stable multi&#8208;logic operations based on the SELC modulated current conversions between the two resonances and Coulomb blockade regimes are demonstrated via the implementation of all universal 1&#8208;input (YES/NOT/PASS_1/PASS_0) and 2&#8208;input (AND/XOR/OR/NAND/NOR/INT/XNOR) logic gates.

         <title>Implanting an Electron Donor to Enlarge the d&#8211;p Hybridization of High&#8208;Entropy (Oxy)hydroxide: A Novel Design to Boost Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel quantitative d&#8211;p hybridization theory is proposed to effectively illustrate the catalytic activity of each metal site in a high&#8208;entropy (HE) system, providing a guideline for the design/fabrication of advanced HE catalysts. Accordingly, a new way of introducing electron donors to construct catalysts with reinforced activity is raised and verified. The corresponding Ag&#8208;decorated HE Co&#8211;Cu&#8211;Fe&#8211;Ag&#8211;Mo (oxy)hydroxide electrocatalyst exhibits excellent electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction performance.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy (HE) electrocatalysts are becoming a research hotspot due to their interesting &#8220;cocktail effect&#8221; and have great potential for tailored catalytic properties. However, it is still a great challenge to illustrate their inherent catalytic mechanism for the &#8220;cocktail effect&#8221;, and there is also a paucity of quantitative descriptors to characterize the specific catalytic activity and give logical design strategies for HE systems. Herein, the unexpected activation of all metal sites in HE Cu&#8211;Co&#8211;Fe&#8211;Ag&#8211;Mo (oxy)hydroxides for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is reported, and it is found that metal&#8211;oxygen d&#8211;p hybridization, as an effective descriptor, can indicate the intrinsic activity of each metal site. According to the quantitative hybridization, introducing an electron donor (e.g., Ag) is raised and verified to reinforce the electrocatalytic activity of the HE system. Consequently, Ag&#8208;decorated Co&#8211;Cu&#8211;Fe&#8211;Ag&#8211;Mo (oxy)hydroxide (Ag@CoCuFeAgMoOOH) electrocatalysts are constructed by an electrochemical reconstruction method, and their OER performances are thoroughly characterized. The Ag@CoCuFeAgMoOOH is verified with a low overpotential (270&#160;mV at 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2) and a small Tafel slope (35.3&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1), as well as good electrochemical stability. The favorable activity of the electron donor and underlying synergistic &#8220;cocktail effect&#8221; are demonstrated and disclosed. This work opens up a new strategy to guide the design/fabrication of advanced HE electrocatalysts.

         <title>Steric Engineering Enables Efficient and Photostable Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskites for All&#8208;Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells</title>

Efficient and photostable wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskites (&#8776;1.8&#160;eV) with only 25&#160;mol% bromide are enabled by steric engineering via alloying dimethylammonium and chloride. The WBG single&#8208;junction cells, with a high efficiency of 17.7%, exhibit promising operational stability under 1&#8208;sun illumination (T90 of 1045 h). This strategy enables all&#8208;perovskite tandem with an impressive stabilized efficiency of 26.0%.








Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG, &#8776;1.8&#160;eV) perovskite is a crucial component to pair with narrow&#8208;bandgap perovskite in low&#8208;cost monolithic all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells. However, the stability and efficiency of WBG perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are constrained by the light&#8208;induced halide segregation and by the large photovoltage deficit. Here, a steric engineering to obtain high&#8208;quality and photostable WBG perovskites (&#8776;1.8&#160;eV) suitable for all&#8208;perovskite tandems is reported. By alloying dimethylammonium and chloride into the mixed&#8208;cation mixed&#8208;halide perovskites, wide bandgaps are obtained with much lower bromide contents while the lattice strain and trap densities are simultaneously minimized. The WBG PSCs exhibit considerably improved performance and photostability, retaining &gt;90%&#160;of their initial efficiencies after 1000 h of operation at maximum power point. With the triple&#8208;cation/triple&#8208;halide WBG perovskites enabled by steric engineering, a stabilized power conversion efficiency of 26.0% in all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells is further obtained. The strategy provides an avenue to fabricate efficient and stable WBG subcells for multijunction photovoltaic devices.

         <title>A Multitasking Flexible Sensor via Reservoir Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multitasking, flexible sensor sheet for monitoring of weather information via a flexible resistive sensor and reservoir computing is reported. This sensor and reservoir computing combination enables the device to estimate water droplet volume and wind velocity with a small training dataset. An important advance is to realize multiple parameter detection simultaneously using only one flexible sensor.








Abstract
Natural disasters are reported globally, and one source of severe damage to cities is flooding caused by locally heavy rain. Sharing of local weather information can save lives. However, it is difficult to collect local weather information in real&#8208;time because such data collection requires bulky, expensive sensors. For local, real&#8208;time monitoring of heavy rain and wind, a sensor system should be simple and low&#8208;cost so that it can be attached to a variety of surfaces, including roofs, vehicles, and umbrellas. To develop simple, low&#8208;cost multitasking sensors located on nonplanar surfaces, a flexible rain sensor to monitor waterdrop volume and wind velocity is devised. To monitor both simultaneously, a laser&#8208;induced graphene&#8208;based superhydrophobic conductive film is introduced. Using the superhydrophobic surface, water dynamics are measured when waterdrops collide with the sensor surface, and obtained time&#8208;series data are processed using &#8220;reservoir computing&#8221; to extract the volume and velocity from a single sensor as multitasking electronics. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, it is shown that the sensor measures continuous, long&#8208;term volume and wind&#8208;change dynamics. The results demonstrate feasibility of multitasking electronics with reservoir computing to reduce sensor integration complexity with low power consumption for both sensor and signal processing.

         <title>Transition Metal Carbo&#8208;Chalcogenide &#8220;TMCC:&#8221; A New Family of 2D Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of 2D transition metal carbo&#8208;chalcogenides (TMCCs) can be considered an atomic&#8208;level combination of TM carbides (MXenes) and TM dichalcogenides (TMDCs). Realized by electrochemical&#8208;assisted delamination, Nb2S2C and Ta2S2C are the first examples of TMCCs to be delaminated into single layers. These newly developed 2D TMCCs are 50% stronger than TMDC counterparts and have a wide range of applications.








Abstract
Here, a new family of 2D transition metal carbo&#8208;chalcogenides (TMCCs) is reported, which can be considered a combination of two well&#8208;known families, TM carbides (MXenes) and TM dichalcogenides (TMDCs), at the atomic level. Single sheets are successfully obtained from multilayered Nb2S2C and Ta2S2C using electrochemical lithiation followed by sonication in water. The parent multilayered TMCCs are synthesized using a simple, scalable solid&#8208;state synthesis followed by a topochemical reaction. Superconductivity transition is observed at 7.55 K for Nb2S2C. The delaminated Nb2S2C outperforms both multilayered Nb2S2C and delaminated NbS2 as an electrode material for Li&#8208;ion batteries. Ab initio calculations predict the elastic constant of TMCC to be over 50% higher than that of TMDC.

         <title>In&#8208;Memory Computing using Memristor Arrays with Ultrathin 2D PdSeOx/PdSe2 Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;voltage memristor array based on ultrathin PdSeOx/PdSe2 heterostructure is demonstrated using controllable ultraviolet&#8211;ozone treatment. By confining the formation of conductive filaments in the heterostructure, the memristor achieves a remarkable uniform switching with low set and reset voltage variability of 4.8% and &#8722;3.6%, respectively. The crossbar array further enables multiple convolutional image processing with a high image&#8208;recognition accuracy of &#8776;93.4%.








Abstract
In&#8208;memory computing based on memristor arrays holds promise to address the speed and energy issues of the classical von Neumann computing system. However, the stochasticity of ions&#8217; transport in conventional oxide&#8208;based memristors imposes severe intrinsic variability, which compromises learning accuracy and hinders the implementation of neural network hardware accelerators. Here, these challenges are addressed using a low&#8208;voltage memristor array based on an ultrathin PdSeOx/PdSe2 heterostructure switching medium realized by a controllable ultraviolet (UV)&#8211;ozone treatment. A distinctively different ions&#8217; transport mechanism is revealed in the heterostructure that can confine the formation of conductive filaments, leading to a remarkable uniform switching with low set and reset voltage variability values of 4.8% and &#8722;3.6%, respectively. Moreover, convolutional image processing is further implemented using various crossbar kernels that achieve a high recognition accuracy of &#8776;93.4% due to the highly linear and symmetric analog weight update as well as multiple conductance states, manifesting its potential beyond von Neumann computing.

         <title>Nanostructured Metallic Glass in a Highly Upgraded Energy State Contributing to Efficient Catalytic Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrodeposited Ni&#8211;P nanostructured metallic glass (NG) is located in an extremely high energy state due to its heterogeneous structure, which significantly promotes its catalytic performance. Modified Ni&#8211;P NG displays the best urea oxidation reaction (UOR) performance of Ni&#8208;based alloys, with a low potential of 1.36 V @ 10 mA cm&#8211;2, and a Tafel slope of 13 mV dec&#8722;1.








Abstract
Metallic glasses (MGs), with high density of low coordination sites and high Gibbs free energy state, are novel promising and competitive candidates in the family of electrochemical catalysts. However, it remains a grand challenge to modify the properties of MGs by control of the disordered atomic structure. Recently, nanostructured metallic glasses (NGs), consisting of amorphous nanometer&#8208;sized grains connected by amorphous interfaces, have been reported to exhibit tunable properties compared to the MGs with identical chemical composition. Here, it is demonstrated that electrodeposited Ni&#8211;P NG is characterized by an extremely high energy state due to its heterogeneous structure, which significantly promotes the catalytic performance. Moreover, the Ni&#8211;P NG with a heterogeneous structure is a perfect precursor for the fabrication of unique honey&#8208;like nanoporous structure, which displays superior catalytic performance in the urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Specifically, modified Ni&#8211;P NG requires a potential of mere 1.36&#160;V at 10&#160;mA cm&#8211;2, with a Tafel slope of 13&#160;mV dec&#8211;1, which is the best UOR performance in Ni&#8208;based alloys.

&lt;p&gt;Electrodeposited Ni&#8211;P nanostructured metallic glass (NG) is located in an extremely high energy state due to its heterogeneous structure, which significantly promotes its catalytic performance. Modified Ni&#8211;P NG displays the best urea oxidation reaction (UOR) performance of Ni-based alloys, with a low potential of 1.36 V @ 10 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and a Tafel slope of 13 mV dec&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metallic glasses (MGs), with high density of low coordination sites and high Gibbs free energy state, are novel promising and competitive candidates in the family of electrochemical catalysts. However, it remains a grand challenge to modify the properties of MGs by control of the disordered atomic structure. Recently, nanostructured metallic glasses (NGs), consisting of amorphous nanometer-sized grains connected by amorphous interfaces, have been reported to exhibit tunable properties compared to the MGs with identical chemical composition. Here, it is demonstrated that electrodeposited Ni&#8211;P NG is characterized by an extremely high energy state due to its heterogeneous structure, which significantly promotes the catalytic performance. Moreover, the Ni&#8211;P NG with a heterogeneous structure is a perfect precursor for the fabrication of unique honey-like nanoporous structure, which displays superior catalytic performance in the urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Specifically, modified Ni&#8211;P NG requires a potential of mere 1.36&#160;V at 10&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;2&lt;/sup&gt;, with a Tafel slope of 13&#160;mV dec&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is the best UOR performance in Ni-based alloys. The present work demonstrates that the nanostructurization of MGs provides a universal and effective pathway to upgrade the energy state of MGs for the design of high-performance catalysts in energy conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Defective Fe Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Enhance Metabolic Profiling for High&#8208;Accuracy Diagnosis of Human Cancers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A precisely engineered metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) is developed as the matrix for laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry for the acquisition of serum metabolic fingerprints. Fe&#8208;MOF&#8208;UL with favorable charge transfer and mitigated thermal dissipation achieves &#8776;10&#160;000&#8208;fold signal enhancement and leads to high&#8208;accuracy diagnosis of three major cancers, promising a universal detection tool for human cancers.








Abstract
Cancers heavily threaten human life; therefore, a high&#8208;accuracy diagnosis is vital to protect human beings from the suffering of cancers. While biopsies and imaging methods are widely used as current technologies for cancer diagnosis, a new detection platform by metabolic analysis is expected due to the significant advantages of fast, simple, and cost&#8208;effectiveness with high body tolerance. However, the signal of molecule biomarkers is too weak to acquire high&#8208;accuracy diagnosis. Herein, precisely engineered metal&#8211;organic frameworks for laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry, allowing favorable charge transfer within the molecule&#8211;substrate interface and mitigated thermal dissipation by adjusting the phonon scattering with metal nodes, are developed. Consequently, a surprising signal enhancement of &#8776;10 000&#8208;fold is achieved, resulting in diagnosis of three major cancers (liver/lung/kidney cancer) with area&#8208;under&#8208;the&#8208;curve of 0.908&#8211;0.964 and accuracy of 83.2%&#8211;90.6%, which promises a universal detection tool for large&#8208;scale clinical diagnosis of human cancers.

         <title>Single&#8208;Junction Organic Solar Cells with 19.17% Efficiency Enabled by Introducing One Asymmetric Guest Acceptor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new ternary system is developed by introducing an asymmetric electron acceptor BTP&#8208;2F2Cl into the PM1:L8&#8208;BO host system. The ternary system exhibits a record&#8208;high efficiency of 19.17% and demonstrates better long&#8208;term stability compared to the host system.








Abstract
The ternary strategy has been widely identified as an effective approach to obtain high&#8208;efficiency organic solar cells (OSCs). However, for most ternary OSCs, the nonradiative voltage loss lies between those of the two binary devices, which limits further efficiency improvements. Herein, an asymmetric guest acceptor BTP&#8208;2F2Cl is designed and incorporated into a PM1:L8&#8208;BO host blend. Compared with the L8&#8208;BO neat film, the L8&#8208;BO:BTP&#8208;2F2Cl blend film shows higher photoluminescence quantum yield and larger exciton diffusion length. Introducing BTP&#8208;2F2Cl into the host blend extends its absorption spectrum, improves the molecular packing of host materials, and suppresses the nonradiative charge recombination of the ternary OSCs. Consequently, the power conversion efficiency is improved up to 19.17% (certified value 18.7%), which represents the highest efficiency value reported for single&#8208;junction OSCs so far. The results show that improving the exciton behaviors is a promising approach to reducing the nonradiative voltage loss and realizing high&#8208;performance OSCs.

         <title>Progress and Future Prospects of Wide&#8208;Bandgap Metal&#8208;Compound&#8208;Based Passivating Contacts for Silicon Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Given the increasing interest in searching for high&#8208;quality low&#8208;cost passivating contacts for c&#8208;Si solar cells, the fundamentals and development status of wide&#8208;bandgap metal&#8208;compound&#8208;based passivating contacts are reviewed and the challenges and potential solutions in developing highly transparent passivating contacts with excellent carrier selectivity are discussed. Based on in&#8208;depth data analysis and simulations, the improvement strategies for metal&#8208;compound&#8208;based passivating contacts design and device integration are pointed out.








Abstract
Advanced doped&#8208;silicon&#8208;layer&#8208;based passivating contacts have boosted the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single&#8208;junction crystalline silicon (c&#8208;Si) solar cells to over 26%. However, the inevitable parasitic light absorption of the doped silicon layers impedes further PCE improvement. To this end, alternative passivating contacts based on wide&#8208;bandgap metal compounds (so&#8208;called dopant&#8208;free passivating contacts (DFPCs)) have attracted great attention, thanks to their potential merits in terms of parasitic absorption loss, ease&#8208;of&#8208;deposition, and cost. Intensive research activity has surrounded this topic with significant progress made in recent years. Various electron&#8208;selective and hole&#8208;selective contacts based on metal compounds have been successfully developed, and a champion PCE of 23.5% has been achieved for a c&#8208;Si solar cell with a MoOx&#8208;based hole&#8208;selective contact. In this work, the fundamentals and development status of DFPCs are reviewed and the challenges and potential solutions for enhancing the carrier selectivity of DFPCs are discussed. Based on comprehensive and in&#8208;depth analysis and simulations, the improvement strategies and future prospects for DFPCs design and device implementation are pointed out. By tuning the carrier concentration of the metal compound and the work function of the capping transparent electrode, high PCEs over 26% can be achieved for c&#8208;Si solar cells with DFPCs.

         <title>Simultaneous Electrochemical Exfoliation and Covalent Functionalization of MoS2 Membrane for Ion Sieving</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through exfoliation of the electrochemically lithium&#8208;intercalated MoS2 in iodoacetamide water solution, the covalent functionalization of single&#8208;layer MoS2 with iodoacetamide molecules can be shortened to 15 min, and functionalized MoS2 membranes are fabricated via vacuum filtration. Under reverse osmosis mode, the functionalized MoS2 membranes exhibit rejection rates of &gt;90% and &gt;80% for various dyes and NaCl, respectively.








Abstract
Transition metal dichalcogenide membranes exhibit good antiswelling properties but poor water desalination property. Here, a one&#8208;step covalent functionalization of MoS2 nanosheets for membrane fabrication is reported, which is accomplished by simultaneous exfoliating and grafting the lithium&#8208;ion&#8208;intercalated MoS2 in organic iodide water solution. The lithium intercalation amount in MoS2 is optimized so that the quality of the produced 2D nanosheets is improved with homogeneous size distribution. The lamellar MoS2 membranes are tested in reverse osmosis (RO), and the functionalized MoS2 membrane exhibits rejection rates of &gt;90% and &gt;80% for various dyes (Rhodamine B, Crystal Violet, Acid Fuchsin, Methyl Orange, and Evans Blue) and NaCl, respectively. The excellent ion&#8208;sieving performance and good water permeability of the functionalized MoS2 membranes are attributed to the suitable channel widths that are tuned by iodoacetamide. Furthermore, the stability of the functionalized MoS2 membranes in NaCl and dye solutions is also confirmed by RO tests. Molecular dynamics simulation shows that water molecules tend to form a single layer between the amide&#8208;functionalized MoS2 layers but a double layer between the ethanol&#8208;functionalized MoS2 (MoS2&#8208;ethanol) layers, which indicates that a less packed structure of water between the MoS2&#8208;ethanol layers leads to lower hydrodynamic resistance and higher permeation.

The lithium intercalation amount in MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is optimized so that the quality of the produced 2D nanosheets is improved with homogeneous size distribution. The lamellar MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; membranes are tested in reverse osmosis (RO), and the functionalized MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; membrane exhibits rejection rates of &amp;gt;90% and &amp;gt;80% for various dyes (Rhodamine B, Crystal Violet, Acid Fuchsin, Methyl Orange, and Evans Blue) and NaCl, respectively. The excellent ion-sieving performance and good water permeability of the functionalized MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; membranes are attributed to the suitable channel widths that are tuned by iodoacetamide. Furthermore, the stability of the functionalized MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; membranes in NaCl and dye solutions is also confirmed by RO tests. Molecular dynamics simulation shows that water molecules tend to form a single layer between the amide-functionalized MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; layers but a double layer between the ethanol-functionalized MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-ethanol) layers, which indicates that a less packed structure of water between the MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-ethanol layers leads to lower hydrodynamic resistance and higher permeation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nontrivial Doping Evolution of Electronic Properties in Ising&#8208;Superconducting Alloys</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates the feasibility of synthesizing stable aliovalent alloys of transition metal dichalcogenide materials in the single&#8208;layer limit throughout the entire alloy composition range. Furthermore, an experimental and theoretical atomic&#8208;scale characterization of the evolution of the electronic ground state (both the electronic structure and collective electronic phases) of a 2D Ising superconductor (single&#8208;layer NbSe2) with structural disorder is reported.








Abstract
Transition metal dichalcogenides offer unprecedented versatility to engineer 2D materials with tailored properties to explore novel structural and electronic phase transitions. In this work, the atomic&#8208;scale evolution of the electronic ground state of a monolayer of Nb1&#8722;&#948;Mo&#948;Se2 across the entire alloy composition range (0 &lt; &#948;&#160;&lt; 1) is investigated using low&#8208;temperature (300 mK) scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS). In particular, the atomic and electronic structure of this 2D alloy throughout the metal to semiconductor transition (monolayer NbSe2 to MoSe2) is studied. The measurements enable extraction of the effective doping of Mo atoms, the bandgap evolution and the band shifts, which are monotonic with &#948;. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that collective electronic phases (charge density wave and superconductivity) are remarkably robust against disorder and further shown that the superconducting TC changes non&#8208;monotonically with doping. This contrasting behavior in the normal and superconducting state is explained using first&#8208;principles calculations. Mo doping is shown to decrease the density of states at the Fermi level and the magnitude of pair&#8208;breaking spin fluctuations as a function of Mo content. These results paint a detailed picture of the electronic structure evolution in 2D TMD alloys, which is of utmost relevance for future 2D materials design.

Flexible Sensors
In article number 2201663, Kohei Nakajima, Kuniharu Takei, and co&#8208;workers propose a multitasking flexible sensor realized by using reservoir computing analysis to estimate rain&#8208;droplet volume and wind flow for future weathercasting. Surface morphology and conditions of the sensor are investigated to detect continuous water&#8208;droplet conductivity precisely, and an optimized reservoir computing algorithm is applied for water&#8208;volume and wind&#8208;flow estimations using a single sensor.

Spinodal Architected Materials
In article number 2109304, Glaucio H. Paulino and co&#8208;workers report spinodal architected materials with tunable anisotropy to unify optimal design and manufacturing of multiscale structures. Mechanical anisotropy and porosity are spatially tailored to directly target mechanical function (e.g., stiffness) and indirectly promote biological function (e.g., fluid transport conduits). Applications to medical (e.g., prosthetics) and mechanical components are demonstrated.

Mechanical anisotropy and porosity are spatially tailored to directly target mechanical function (e.g., stiffness) and indirectly promote biological function (e.g., fluid transport conduits). Applications to medical (e.g., prosthetics) and mechanical components are demonstrated.

Single&#8208;Molecule Devices
In article number 2202135, Zong&#8208;Liang Li, Christian A. Nijhuis, Enrique Del Barco, and co&#8208;workers report a single&#8208;electron logic calculator formed by a gated Au/S&#8208;(CH2)3&#8208;Fc&#8208;(CH2)9&#8208;S/Au transistor. The unique adjacent conductive molecular orbitals in the Fc moiety are controlled by the orthogonal bias and gate voltages, resulting in the implementation of all universal logic gates within a single&#8208;molecule device.

Transition Metal Carbo&#8208;Chalcogenides
In article number 2200574, Michael Naguib and co&#8208;workers report on the synthesis of 2D transition metal carbo&#8208;chalcogenides (TMCCs) by exfoliating their bulk layered counterparts (e.g., Nb2S2C and Ta2S2C) through electrochemical Li&#8208;ion intercalation followed by agitation in water. 2D TMCCs combine the surface of 2D TM dichalcogenides (TMDCs) and the core of 2D TM carbides (MXenes) offering unique characteristics of both TMDCs and MXenes.

         <title>Engineered Living Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The convergence of engineering, biology, and materials science is providing unprecedented opportunities to integrate living microbes into hydrogel matrices. This integration constructs engineered living hydrogels with the capability of performing tasks associated with living microbes such as self&#8208;replication, self&#8208;adaption, and environmental responsiveness.








Abstract
Living biological systems, ranging from single cells to whole organisms, can sense, process information, and actuate in response to changing environmental conditions. Inspired by living biological systems, engineered living cells and nonliving matrices are brought together, which gives rise to the technology of engineered living materials. By designing the functionalities of living cells and the structures of nonliving matrices, engineered living materials can be created to detect variability in the surrounding environment and to adjust their functions accordingly, thereby enabling applications in health monitoring, disease treatment, and environmental remediation. Hydrogels, a class of soft, wet, and biocompatible materials, have been widely used as matrices for engineered living cells, leading to the nascent field of engineered living hydrogels. Here, the interactions between hydrogel matrices and engineered living cells are described, focusing on how hydrogels influence cell behaviors and how cells affect hydrogel properties. The interactions between engineered living hydrogels and their environments, and how these interactions enable versatile applications, are also discussed. Finally, current challenges facing the field of engineered living hydrogels for their applications in clinical and environmental settings are highlighted.

         <dc:description>
Materials with tunable optical properties play a vital role in wearable epidermal sensors with visible readouts, especially in health monitoring. The recent progress, fabrication, and applications of these materials for wearable epidermal sensors are summarized and discussed. A summary of the key challenges and perspectives for the next generation wearable devices is also proposed.








Abstract
Advances in wearable epidermal sensors have revolutionized the way that physiological signals are captured and measured for health monitoring. One major challenge is to convert physiological signals to easily readable signals in a convenient way. One possibility for wearable epidermal sensors is based on visible readouts. There are a range of materials whose optical properties can be tuned by parameters such as temperature, pH, light, and electric fields. Herein, this review covers and highlights a set of materials with tunable optical properties and their integration into wearable epidermal sensors for health monitoring. Specifically, the recent progress, fabrication, and applications of these materials for wearable epidermal sensors are summarized and discussed. Finally, the challenges and perspectives for the next generation wearable devices are proposed.

Abstract
The indispensable requirement for sustainable development of human society has forced almost all countries to seek highly efficient and cost&#8208;effective ways to harvest and convert solar energy. Though continuous progress has advanced, it remains a daunting challenge to achieve full&#8208;spectrum solar absorption and maximize the conversion efficiency of sunlight. Recently, thermoplasmonics has emerged as a promising solution, which involves several beneficial effects including enhanced light absorption and scattering, generation and relaxation of hot carriers, as well as localized/collective heating, offering tremendous opportunities for optimized energy conversion. Besides, all these functionalities can be tailored via elaborated designs of materials and nanostructures. Here, first the fundamental physics governing thermoplasmonics is presented and then the strategies for both material selection and nanostructured designs toward more efficient energy conversion are summarized. Based on this, recent progress in thermoplasmonic applications including solar evaporation, photothermal chemistry, and thermophotovoltaic is reviewed. Finally, the corresponding challenges and prospects are discussed.

         <title>Recent Structural Engineering of Polymer Semiconductors Incorporating Hydrogen Bonds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of hydrogen bonds can enhance the planarity and rigidity of polymer semiconductors via noncovalent interactions, improve the charge transport, and offer polymers unique superiority of mechanical flexibility. This review describes the recent structural evolution of polymer semiconductors containing hydrogen bonds and the effect of hydrogen bonds on carrier mobility, self&#8208;healing, chemical sensitivity, and mechanical properties.








Abstract
Highly planar, extended &#960;&#8208;electron organic conjugated polymers have been increasingly attractive for achieving high&#8208;mobility organic semiconductors. In addition to the conventional strategy to construct rigid backbone by covalent bonds, hydrogen bond has been employed extensively to increase the planarity and rigidity of polymer via intramolecular noncovalent interactions. This review provides a general summary of high&#8208;mobility semiconducting polymers incorporating hydrogen bonds in field&#8208;effect transistors over recent years. The structural engineering of the hydrogen bond&#8208;containing building blocks and the discussion of theoretical simulation, microstructural characterization, and device performance are covered. Additionally, the effects of the introduction of hydrogen bond on self&#8208;healing, stretchability, chemical sensitivity, and mechanical properties are also discussed. The review aims to help and inspire design of new high&#8208;mobility conjugated polymers with superiority of mechanical flexibility by incorporation of hydrogen bond for the application in flexible electronics.

         <title>Are Liquid Metals Bulk Conductors?</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this article, the wide variety of electromechanical responses of liquid metal stretchable electronics reported in the literature are reviewed. Complementing this review with&#160;our&#160;own measurements, the relative change in resistance of EGaIn is found to be lower than that of a bulk conductor. Then, possible explanations for the discrepancies are dicussed and suggestions are provided on experimental design for future research.








Abstract
Stretchable electronics have potential in wide&#8208;reaching applications including wearables, personal health monitoring, and soft robotics. Many recent advances in stretchable electronics leverage liquid metals, particularly eutectic gallium&#8208;indium (EGaIn). A variety of EGaIn electromechanical behaviors have been reported, ranging from bulk conductor responses to effectively strain&#8208;insensitive responses. However, numerous measurement techniques have been used throughout the literature, making it difficult to directly compare the various proposed formulations. Here, the electromechanical responses of EGaIn found in the literature is reviewed and pure EGaIn is investigated using three electrical resistance measurement techniques: four point probe, two point probe, and Wheatstone bridge. The results indicate substantial differences in measured electromechanical behavior between the three methods, which can largely be accounted for by correcting for a fixed offset corresponding to the resistances of various parts of the measurement circuits. Yet, even accounting for several of these sources of experimental error, the average relative change in resistance of EGaIn is found to be lower than that predicted by the commonly used bulk conductor assumption, referred to as Pouillet's law. Building upon recent theories proposed in the literature, possible explanations for the discrepancies are discussed. Finally, suggestions are provided on experimental design to enable reproducible and interpretable research.
