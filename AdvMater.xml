         <title>Recreating Silk's Fibrillar Nanostructure by Spinning Solubilized, Undegummed Silk</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dissolving Undegummed silk leads to a solution with undegraded silk that exhibits liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS). Spinning the solution leads to fibers with a &#8776;20&#160;nm nanofibrillar hierarchy that are 2.3 times tougher than natural silk fibers. This establishes the importance of retaining molecular weight, presence of sericins, and priming LLPS in designing tougher&#8208;than&#8208;nature fibers with fibrillar hierarchy.








Abstract
The remarkable toughness (&gt;70&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3) of silkworm silk is largely attributed to its hierarchically arranged nanofibrillar nanostructure. Recreating such tough fibers through artificial spinning is often challenging, in part because degummed, dissolved silk is drastically different to the unspun native feedstock found in the spinning gland. The present work demonstrates a method to dissolve silk without degumming to produce a solution containing undegraded fibroin and sericin. This solution exhibits liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation above 10% (wt/wt), a behavior observed in the silk gland but not in degummed silk solutions to date. This partitioning enhances the stability of the undegummed solution, delaying gelation two&#8208;fold compared with degummed silk at the same concentration. When spun under identical conditions, undegummed solutions produces fibers 8&#215; stronger and 218&#215; tougher than degummed silk feedstocks. Through ultrasonication, undegummed wet spun fibers are seen to possess hierarchical structure of densely packed &#8776;20&#160;nm nanofibrils, similar to native silks, although completely absent from fibers wet&#8208;spun from degummed silk solutions. This work demonstrates that the preservation of molecular weight, presence of sericin and stimulation of liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation underpin a new pathway to recreate a hierarchical fiber with structures akin to native silk.

         <title>Lanmodulin&#8208;Decorated Microbes for Efficient Lanthanide Recovery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bio&#8208;scaffolded lanmodulin (LanM) on E. coli is developed as a simple, effective material for repeated capture and release of rare earth elements (REEs). Over 80% of four REE cations are captured, even in the presence of excess competitive ions. The material can be employed in a filtration flow&#8208;through system with a capture capacity of 11.8 &#177; 0.9 mg g&#8722;1 dry cell weight.








Abstract
Rare earth elements (REEs) are essential for many clean energy technologies. Yet, they are a limited resource currently obtained through carbon&#8208;intensive mining. Here, bio&#8208;scaffolded proteins serve as simple, effective materials for the recovery of REEs. Surface expression of the protein lanmodulin (LanM) on E. coli, followed by freeze&#8208;drying of the microbes, yields a displayed protein material for REE recovery. Four REE cations (Y3+, La3+, Gd3+, and Tb3+) are captured efficiently, with over 80% recovery even in the presence of competitive ions at one&#8208;hundred&#8208;fold excess. Moreover, these materials are readily integrated into a filter with high capture capacity (12 mg g&#8722;1 dry cell weight) for the selective isolation and recovery of REEs from complex matrices. Further, the proteins in the filter remain stable over ten bind&#8208;and&#8208;release cycles and a week of storage. To improve the deployability of this filter material, a simple colorimetric assay with the dye alizarin&#8208;3&#8208;methyliminodiacetic acid is incorporated. The assay can be performed in under 5 min, enabling rapid monitoring of REE recovery and filter efficiency. Overall, this low&#8208;cost, robust material will enable environmentally friendly recycling and recovery of critical elements.

         <title>Perovskite&#8208;Based Smart Eyeglasses as Noncontact Human&#8211;Computer Interaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Smart eyeglasses based on perovskite photodetectors are developed, capable of directly converting visual stimuli from the reflected light of the eyeballs into electrical signals. After scaling up the pretraining data and model size, these eyeglasses achieve noncontact monitoring of eyeball movement with a 5&#176; recognition angle, enabling unobtrusive control of a model car to execute 9 commands with 99.86% accuracy.








Abstract
More than 70% of human information comes from vision. The eye is one of the most attractive sensing sites to collect biological parameters. However, it is urgent to develop a cost&#8208;effective and easy&#8208;to&#8208;use approach to monitor eyeball information in a minimally invasive way instead of current smart contact lenses or camera&#8208;based eyeglasses. Here, the biomimetic mineralization strategy is developed to prepare large&#8208;grained perovskite film on the glass with prepared ITO electrodes, which displays the on&#8211;off ratio close to 300 times at 500 Lux light intensity, and the responsiveness reaches 22.09 A&#160;W&#8722;1. The smart eyeglasses composed of perovskite&#8208;based photodetectors can directly convert the visual stimuli from the reflective light of eyeballs into electrical signals in all light circumstances. After scaling up the pretraining data and the model size, the smart eyeglasses achieve the noncontact monitoring of the eyeball movement with the recognition angle of 5&#176;, which can be used to unobtrusively drive the model car with great freedom. The smart eyeglasses based on the perovskite photodetectors provide cost&#8208;effective approaches for monitoring eyeball movements, which will show great potential in the applications of man&#8208;machine control, augmented reality, individual healthcare, etc.

         <title>Surface Modification of 3D Biomimetic Shark Denticle Structures for Drag Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomimetic shark denticles with alternating superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic regions are fabricated through 3D printing. Superhydrophobic and partially superhydrophobic denticles exhibit superior drag reduction performance compared to superhydrophilic ones by minimizing vortex formation, presenting a novel approach to the biomimetic design of shark denticles for optimal drag reduction.








Abstract
Shark skin features superhydrophilic and riblet&#8208;textured denticles that provide drag reduction, antifouling, and mechanical protection. The artificial riblet structures exhibit drag reduction capabilities in turbulent flow. However, the effects of the surface wettability of shark denticles and the cavity region underneath the denticle crown on drag reduction remain insufficiently explored. Here, 3D printing is utilized to fabricate realistic staggered and overlapped denticle arrays, modified to achieve superhydrophilic, superhydrophobic, and hybrid configurations, including external riblets hydrophilic/internal cavities hydrophobic (ELIB), and vice versa (EBIL). Denticles of varying heights are also fabricated. The results indicate that superhydrophobic, ELIB, and EBIL denticles outperform superhydrophilic ones in reducing drag, achieving a peak drag reduction rate of &#8776;20%. Notably, shorter denticles further improve drag reduction. Reduced vortex formation within the underneath cavity correlates with improved drag reduction. These vortices can function similarly to rolling bearings while facilitating momentum exchange and increasing skin friction drag. Superhydrophobic or partially superhydrophobic denticles (ELIBD/EBILD) mitigate this effect. This study suggests that sharks may secrete mucus on specific sections of their denticles to further reduce vorticity and drag, offering novel insights into the biomimetic design of shark denticles for optimized drag reduction.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Fast Moisture Sensor for Respiratory Cycle Monitoring and Non&#8208;Contact Sensing Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanogap electrodes are combined with egg albumen to develop a fast and sensitive moisture sensor. This device integrates scalable manufacturing, exceptional sensitivity, rapid response times, and selective moisture detection across a 10&#8211;70% relative humidity range. The sensor is used for non&#8208;contact sensing applications and monitoring respiratory cycles in real&#8208;world settings.








Abstract
As human&#8208;machine interface hardware advances, better sensors are required to detect signals from different stimuli. Among numerous technologies, humidity sensors are critical for applications across different sectors, including environmental monitoring, food production, agriculture, and healthcare. Current humidity sensors rely on materials that absorb moisture, which can take some time to equilibrate with the surrounding environment, thus slowing their temporal response and limiting their applications. Here, this challenge is tackled by combining a nanogap electrode (NGE) architecture with chicked egg&#8208;derived albumen as the moisture&#8208;absorbing component. The sensors offer inexpensive manufacturing, high responsivity, ultra&#8208;fast response, and selectivity to humidity within a relative humidity range of 10&#8211;70% RH. Specifically, the egg albumen&#8208;based sensor showed negligible response to relevant interfering species and remained specific to water moisture with a room&#8208;temperature responsivity of 1.15&#160;&#215;&#160;104. The nm&#8208;short interelectrode distance (circa 20&#160;nm) of the NGE architecture enables fast temporal response, with rise/fall times of 10/28&#160;ms, respectively, making the devices the fastest humidity sensors reported to date based on a biomaterial. By leveraging these features, non&#8208;contact moisture sensing and real&#8208;time respiratory cycle monitoring suitable for diagnosing chronic diseases such as sleep apnea, asthma, and pulmonary disease are demonstrated.

         <title>Phase&#8208;Engineered Bi&#8208;RuO2 Single&#8208;Atom Alloy Oxide Boosting Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysis in Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolyzer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique Bi&#8208;RuO2 single&#8208;atom alloy oxide is rational designed and achieved by phase engineering of the hexagonal close&#8208;packed RuBi single&#8208;atom alloy, to boost oxygen evolution electrocatalysis. The incorporation of Bi1 improves the activity by electronic density optimization and the stability by hindering surface Ru demetallation, enabling a practical proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) that needs only 1.59 V to reach 1.0 A cm&#8722;2.









Abstract
Engineering nanomaterials at single&#8208;atomic sites can enable unprecedented catalytic properties for broad applications, yet it remains challenging to do so on RuO2&#8208;based electrocatalysts for proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE). Herein, the rational design and construction of Bi&#8208;RuO2 single&#8208;atom alloy oxide (SAAO) are presented to boost acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), via phase engineering a novel hexagonal close packed (hcp) RuBi single&#8208;atom alloy. This Bi&#8208;RuO2 SAAO electrocatalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 192&#160;mV and superb stability over 650&#160;h at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, enabling a practical PEMWE that needs only 1.59&#160;V to reach 1.0 A cm&#8722;2 under industrial conditions. Operando differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy analysis, coupled with density functional theory studies, confirmed the adsorbate&#8208;evolving mechanism on Bi&#8208;RuO2 SAAO and that the incorporation of Bi1 improves the activity by electronic density optimization and the stability by hindering surface Ru demetallation. This work not only introduces a new strategy to fabricate high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts at atomic&#8208;level, but also demonstrates their potential use in industrial electrolyzers.

         <title>Super&#8208;Resolution Goes Viral: T4 Virus Particles as Versatile 3D&#8208;Bio&#8208;NanoRulers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various super&#8208;resolution fluorescence microscopy methods achieve nanoscale resolution, vital for visualizing subcellular structures. Choosing suitable biological standards is challenging, demanding precise geometry and specific labeling capabilities. Utilizing T4 bacteriophage as a 3D&#8208;Bio&#8208;NanoRuler is proposed. With DNA&#8208;PAINT and astigmatic imaging, detailed viral structures are revealed, offering a simple sample protocol and suggesting T4's potential as a benchmark in microscopy studies.








Abstract
In the burgeoning field of super&#8208;resolution fluorescence microscopy, significant efforts are being dedicated to expanding its applications into the 3D domain. Various methodologies have been developed that enable isotropic resolution at the nanometer scale, facilitating the visualization of 3D subcellular structures with unprecedented clarity. Central to this progress is the need for reliable 3D structures that are biologically compatible for validating resolution capabilities. Choosing the optimal standard poses a considerable challenge, necessitating, among other attributes, precisely defined geometry and the capability for specific labeling at sub&#8208;diffraction&#8208;limit distances. In this context, the use of the non&#8208;human&#8208;infecting virus, bacteriophage T4 is introduced as an effective and straightforward bio&#8208;ruler for 3D super&#8208;resolution imaging. Employing DNA point accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography (DNA&#8208;PAINT) along with the technique of astigmatic imaging, the icosahedral capsid of the bacteriophage T4, measuring 120&#160;nm in length and 86&#160;nm in width, and its hollow viral tail is uncovered. This level of detail in light microscopy represents a significant advancement in T4 imaging. A simple protocol for the production and preparation of samples is further outlined. Moreover, the extensive potential of bacteriophage T4 as a multifaceted 3D bio&#8208;ruler, proposing its application as a novel benchmark for 3D super&#8208;resolution imaging in biological studies is explored.

         <title>Phytic Acid&#8208;Induced Gradient Hydrogels for Highly Sensitive and Broad Range Pressure Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Distinct interactions between phytic acid and various polymers are discovered first and leveraged to construct a gradient ionic hydrogel&#8208;based pressure sensor, which offers excellent sensitivity, wide sensing range, and superior low&#8208;pressure detection performance. The gradient ionic hydrogel&#8208;based sensor recognizes subtle pressures from acoustic waves and airflow, moderate pressures due to speaking and finger pressing, and high magnitudes of plantar pressures.








Abstract
Ionic conductive hydrogels have emerged as an excellent option for constructing dielectric layers of interfacial iontronic sensors. Among these, gradient ionic hydrogels, due to the intrinsic gradient elastic modulus, can achieve a wide range of pressure responses. However, the fabrication of gradient hydrogels with optimal mechanical and sensing properties remains a challenge. In this study, it is discovered first that phytic acid (PA) interacts in remarkably distinct manners (i.e., plasticizing effects and phase separation) with different polymers (i.e., polyacrylamide and polyacrylic acid). This distinctive PA&#8208;polymer interacting mechanism is innovatively utilized to construct a modulus gradient ionic hydrogel through a simple precursor solution infiltration approach. The gradient hydrogel&#8208;based flexible pressure sensor not only achieves a high sensitivity (9.00&#160;kPa&#8722;1, &lt;15&#160;kPa) and a broad sensing range (from &#8776;3.7&#160;Pa to 1.2&#160;MPa) simultaneously, but also exhibits superior low pressure sensing performance. It successfully recognizes the subtle pressure due to acoustic waves and airflow, as well as the moderate pressure due to speaking and finger pressing and the high magnitude of plantar pressure. In addition, the gradient hydrogel demonstrates remarkable antibacterial properties and biocompatibility. This functional hydrogel with excellent sensing performance and bioactivity exhibits exceptional potential for wearable sensing applications.

         <dc:description>
This review addresses challenges in material science, stability, and scalability for the transition of perovskite solar technology from rigid to flexible, emphasizes robust encapsulation, and proposes protocols for mechanical stability, which is crucial for their commercialization. The flexible perovskite PV technologies will enable new possibilities by integration into diverse technologies.








Abstract
Perovskite technologies has taken giant steps on its advances in only a decade time, from fundamental science to device engineering. The possibility to exploit this technology on a thin flexible substrate gives an unbeatable power to weight ratio compares to similar photovoltaic systems, opening new possibilities and new integration concepts, going from building integrated and applied photovoltaics (BIPV, BAPV) to internet of things (IoT). In this perspective, the recent progress of perovskite solar technologies on flexible substrates are summarized, focusing on the challenges that researchers face upon using flexible substrates. A dig into material science is necessary to understand what kind of mechanisms are limiting its efficiency compare to rigid substrates, and which physical mechanism limits the upscaling on flexible substrate. Furthermore, an overview of stability test on flexible modules will be described, suggesting common standard procedure and guidelines to follow, showing additional issues that flexible modules face upon bending, and how to prevent device degradation providing an ad&#8208;hoc encapsulation. Finally, the recent advances of flexible devices in the perovskite market will be shown, giving an outline of how this technology is exploited on flexible substrates, and what are still missing that need stakeholders&#8217; attention.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Modified Zr&#8208;MOFs with AIE Ligands for Boosting CO2 Adsorption and Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel AIE&#8208;active ligand, tetraphenylpyrazine (PTTBPC), is designed based on reticular chemistry and utilized for the first time to construct a series of robust Zr/(Ni, Co)&#8208; PTTBPC photocatalysts. The single&#8208;phase multi&#8208;component synergy of pore structure, unique photo&#8208;active AIE ligands, and dual&#8208;metal catalytic sites result in the excellent CO2 uptake and reduction performance. The highest CO production rate of 293.2&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#160;h&#8722;1 under 420&#160;nm LED light is achieved, showcasing the potential of AIE ligands in photocatalytic CO2 conversion.








Abstract
The design and synthesis of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with outstanding light&#8208;harvesting and photoexcitation for artificial photocatalytic CO2 reduction is an attractive but challenging task. In this work, a novel aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;active ligand, tetraphenylpyrazine (PTTBPC) is proposed and utilized for the first time to construct a Zr&#8208;MOF photocatalyst via coordination with stable Zr&#8208;oxo clusters. Zr&#8208;MOF is featured by a scu topology with a two&#8208;fold interpenetrated framework, wherein the PTTBPC ligands enable strong light&#8208;harvesting and photoexcitation, while the Zr&#8208;oxo clusters facilitate CO2 adsorption and activation, as well as offer potential sites for further metal modification. Consequently, the Zr&#8208;PTTBPC and its Co/Ni derivatives not only exhibit exceptional stability and high CO2 adsorption capability (73&#160;cm3 g&#8722;1 at 273 K and 1 atm), but also demonstrate a CO production rate of up to 293.2&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#160;h&#8722;1 under 420&#160;nm LED light that can be reused for at least three cycles. With insights from charge&#8208;carrier dynamics and theoretical calculations, the underlying mechanism is revealed, confirming that the single&#8208;phase multi&#8208;component synergy is the key for the outstanding photocatalytic CO2 reduction. This work showcases a brand&#8208;new type of MOF photocatalyst based on AIE ligands and their promising applications in photocatalytic C1 conversion.

         <title>Design of Fluorinated Peptides as Biotransformed Urinalysis Biomarkers for Non&#8208;Invasive Diagnosis and Treatment of Liver Injury through Enzyme Directed Kinetics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorinated peptides are designed as synthetic biomarkers for the time&#8208;gated 19F nuclear magnetic resonance urinalysis through enzyme&#8208;activated assembly, which regulates the metabolic kinetics of fluorinated peptides. Moreover, the fluorinated peptides are further conjugated with therapeutic agents and demonstrated great efficiency in the treatment of cholestatic liver injury.








Abstract
Urinalysis, as a non&#8208;invasive and efficient diagnostic method, is very important but faces great challenges due to the complex compositions of urine and limited naturally occurring biomarkers for diseases. Herein, by leveraging the intrinsic absence of endogenous fluorinated interference, a strategy with the enzymatically activated assembly of synthetic fluorinated peptide for cholestatic liver injury (CLI) diagnosis and treatment through 19F nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) urinalysis and efficient drug retention is developed. Specifically, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), overexpressed in the liver of CLI mice, triggers the assembly of fluorinated peptide, thus, directing&#160;the traffic and dynamic distribution of the synthetic biomarkers after administration, whereas CLI mice display much slower clearance of peptides through urine as compared with healthy counterparts. As such, it enables to transform pathophysiological information into exogenous signals via noninvasive urinary monitoring. Moreover, as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, by grafting different functional groups to peptides, the theranostic platforms can be established to provide&#160;a new paradigm for the design of multifunctional peptides.

Abstract
Carbon&#8208;based printable mesoscopic solar cells (p&#8208;MPSCs) offer significant advantages for industrialization due to their simple fabrication process, low cost, and scalability. Recently, the certified power conversion efficiency of p&#8208;MPSCs has exceeded 22%, drawing considerable attention from the community. However, the key challenge in improving device performance is achieving uniform and high&#8208;quality perovskite crystallization within the mesoporous structure. This review highlights recent advancements in perovskite crystallization for p&#8208;MPSCs, with an emphasis on controlling crystallization kinetics and regulating perovskite morphology within confined mesopores. It first introduces the p&#8208;MPSCs, offering a solid foundation for understanding their behavior. Additionally, the review summarizes the mechanisms of crystal nucleation and growth, explaining how these processes influence the quality and performance of perovskites. Furthermore, commonly applied strategies for enhancing crystallization quality, such as additive engineering, solvent engineering, evaporation controlling, and post&#8208;treatment techniques, are also explored. Finally, the review proposes several potential suggestions aimed at further refining perovskite crystallization, inspiring continued innovation to address current limitations and advance the development of p&#8208;MPSCs.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cellulose nanofiber and alginate from natural sargassum are used to prepare a fire&#8208;retardant structural material through a hydrogel layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer method. This bio&#8208;based material has excellent mechanical properties, thermal stability, and fire retardancy. This work greatly improves the utilization of seaweed residues and natural polymers, provides a bio&#8208;based fire&#8208;retardant strategy, and has important potential in the future development of high&#8208;performance fiber&#8208;based materials.









Abstract
With increasing concern about the environmental pollution of petrochemical plastics, people are constantly exploring environmentally friendly and sustainable alternative materials. Compared with petrochemical materials, cellulose has overwhelming superiority in terms of mechanical properties, thermal properties, cost, and biodegradability. However, the flammability of cellulose hinders its practical application to a certain extent, so improving the fire&#8208;retardant properties of cellulose nanofiber&#8208;based materials has become a research focus. Here, cellulose nanofiber and alginate are extracted from abundant natural sargassum as high&#8208;strength nanoscale building blocks, and then a sargassum cellulose fire&#8208;retardant structural material is prepared through a bottom&#8208;up hydrogel layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer method. The structural materials obtained incorporate excellent mechanical properties (&#8776;297 MPa), thermal stability (&#8776;200&#160;&#176;C), low thermal expansion coefficient (&#8776;7.17 &#215; 10&#8722;6 K&#8722;1), and fire&#8208;retardant properties. This work largely improves the utilization of seaweed residue and natural polymers, providing a bio&#8208;based fire&#8208;retardant strategy, and has a wide range of development prospects in the field of fiber&#8208;based high&#8208;performance structural materials in the future.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Mo1Cu single&#8208;atom alloy is developed to enable atom&#8208;scale cascade catalysis via multi&#8208;active site collaboration for CO2 Electroreduction. The as&#8208;prepared Mo1Cu shows a remarkable C2+ Faradaic efficiency of 86.4% under 0.80 A cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the C2+ partial current density over Mo1Cu reaches an ampere&#8208;level 1.33&#8201;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a Faradaic efficiency surpasses 74.3%.









Abstract
Electrochemical reduction of CO2 to value&#8208;added multicarbon (C2+) productions offers an attractive route for renewable energy storage and CO2 utilization, but it remains challenging to achieve high C2+ selectivity at industrial&#8208;level current density.

         <title>Advances in Oxygen Evolution Reaction Electrocatalysts via Direct Oxygen&#8211;Oxygen Radical Coupling Pathway</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts via the oxide path mechanism (OPM) is systematically reviewed. It sheds light on the rational design of OPM&#8208;based OER electrocatalysts to break the activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;offs involved in conventional OER mechanisms, leading to more efficient energy conversion and storage processes, such as water electrolysis, CO2/N2 reduction, reversible fuel cells, and rechargeable metal&#8208;air batteries.








Abstract
Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a cornerstone of various electrochemical energy conversion and storage systems, including water splitting, CO2/N2 reduction, reversible fuel cells, and rechargeable metal&#8208;air batteries. OER typically proceeds through three primary mechanisms: adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM), lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM), and oxide path mechanism (OPM). Unlike AEM and LOM, the OPM proceeds via direct oxygen&#8211;oxygen radical coupling that can bypass linear scaling relationships of reaction intermediates in AEM and avoid catalyst structural collapse in LOM, thereby enabling enhanced catalytic activity and stability. Despite its unique advantage, electrocatalysts that can drive OER via OPM remain nascent and are increasingly recognized as critical. This review discusses recent advances in OPM&#8208;based OER electrocatalysts. It starts by analyzing three reaction mechanisms that guide the design of electrocatalysts. Then, several types of novel materials, including atomic ensembles, metal oxides, perovskite oxides, and molecular complexes, are highlighted. Afterward, operando characterization techniques used to monitor the dynamic evolution of active sites and reaction intermediates are examined. The review concludes by discussing several research directions to advance OPM&#8208;based OER electrocatalysts toward practical applications.

         <title>Dynamic Reconstruction of Fluid Interface Manipulated by Fluid Balancing Agent for Scalable Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methanol (MeOH) is introduced as a fluid balance agent to regulate Marangoni convection, thereby mitigating disordered colloidal particle motion. As a result, record power conversion efficiencies of 24.45% and 20.32% are achieved for small&#8208;area FAPbI3 devices (0.07&#160;cm2) and large&#8208;area modules (21&#160;cm2), respectively.








Abstract
Laboratory&#8208;scale spin&#8208;coating techniques are widely employed for fabricating small&#8208;size, high&#8208;efficiency perovskite solar cells. However, achieving large&#8208;area, high&#8208;uniformity perovskite films and thus high&#8208;efficiency solar cell devices remain challenging due to the complex fluid dynamics and drying behaviors of perovskite precursor solutions during large&#8208;area fabrication processes. In this work, a high&#8208;quality, pinhole&#8208;free, large&#8208;area FAPbI3 perovskite film is successfully obtained via scalable blade&#8208;coating technology, assisted by a novel bidirectional Marangoni convection strategy. By incorporating methanol (MeOH) as a fluid balance agent, the direction of Marangoni convection is effectively regulated, mitigating the disordered motion of colloidal precursor particles during the printing process. As a result, champion power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 24.45% and 20.32% are achieved for small&#8208;area FAPbI3 devices (0.07&#160;cm2) and large&#8208;area modules (21&#160;cm2), respectively. Notably, under steady illumination, the device reached a stabilized PCE of 24.28%. Furthermore, the unencapsulated device exhibited remarkable operational stability, retaining 92.03% of its initial PCE after 1800&#160;h under ambient conditions (35&#160;&#177;&#160;5% relative humidity, 30&#160;&#176;C). To demonstrate the universality of this strategy, a blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diode is fabricated, showing an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 14.78% and an electroluminescence wavelength (EL) of 494&#160;nm. This work provides a significant technique for advancing solution&#8208;processed, industrial&#8208;scale production of high&#8208;quality and stable perovskite films and solar cells.

         <title>Shear&#8208;Mediated Stabilization of Spin Spiral Order in Multiferroic NiI2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The magneto&#8208;structural phases of 2D multiferroic NiI2 are studied using resonant magnetic X&#8208;ray scattering and X&#8208;ray diffraction. A change of magnetic symmetry from incommensurate collinear to helical spin&#8208;spiral at a structural transition involving a significant interlayer shear is observed. These results highlight the role for interlayer magnetic exchange for driving the magnetic ground state and associated spin&#8208;induced ferroelectricity in NiI2.








Abstract
Type&#8208;II multiferroicity from non&#8208;collinear spin order is recently explored in the van der Waals material NiI2. Despite the importance for improper ferroelectricity, the microscopic mechanism of the helimagnetic order remains poorly understood. Here, the magneto&#8208;structural phases of NiI2 are investigated using resonant magnetic X&#8208;ray scattering (RXS) and X&#8208;ray diffraction. Two competing magnetic phases are identified. Below 60 K, an incommensurate magnetic reflection (q&#160;&#8776;&#160;[0.143,0,1.49] reciprocal lattice units) is observed which exhibits finite circular dichroism in RXS, signaling the inversion symmetry&#8208;breaking helimagnetic ground state. At elevated temperature, in the non&#8208;polar phase (60 K&#160;&lt;&#160;T&#160;&lt;&#160;75 K), a distinct q&#160;&#8776;&#160;[0.087,0.087,1.5] magnetic order is observed, attributed to a collinear incommensurate (CI) state. The first&#8208;order CI&#8208;helix transition is concomitant with a structural transition characterized by a significant interlayer shear, which drives the helimagnetic ground state as evidenced by a mean&#8208;field Heisenberg model including interlayer exchange and its coupling to the structural distortion. These findings identify interlayer magneto&#8208;structural coupling as the key driver behind multiferroicity in NiI2.

         <title>A Phase&#8208;Transition&#8211;Free Sodium Vanadium Phosphate Cathode via Medium&#8208;Entropy Engineering for Superior Sodium Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A medium&#8208;entropy Na3.2V1.1Ti0.2Al0.2Cr0.2Mn0.2Ni0.1(PO4)3 (ME&#8208;NVP) cathode is developed, featuring a phase&#8208;transition&#8211;free mechanism, reversible V3+/V4+/V5+ plateaus, rapid Na+ diffusion, and minimal volume change, as confirmed by comprehensive in/ex situ characterizations and theoretical calculations. Thus, the medium&#8208;entropy effect favors ME&#8208;NVP cathode an exceptional sodium storage performance with high&#8208;rate capacity and long&#8208;term cycle stability.









Abstract
Na3V2(PO4)3, based on multi&#8208;electron reactions between V3+/V4+/V5+, is a promising cathode material for SIBs. However, its practical application is hampered by the inferior conductivity, large barrier of V4+/V5+, and stepwise phase transition. Herein, these issues are addressed by constructing a medium&#8208;entropy material (Na3.2V1.1Ti0.2Al0.2Cr0.2Mn0.2Ni0.1(PO4)3, ME&#8208;NVP) with strong ME&#9472;O bond and highly occupied Na2 sites. Benefiting from the medium&#8208;entropy effect, ME&#8208;NVP manifests a phase&#8208;transition&#8211;free reaction mechanism, two reversible plateaus at 3.4 (V3+/V4+) and 4.0&#160;V (V4+/V5+), and small volume change (2%) during Na+ insertion/extraction processes, as confirmed by comprehensive in/ex situ characterizations. Moreover, kinetics analysis illuminates the superior Na+ diffusion ability of ME&#8208;NVP. Thus, the ME&#8208;NVP cathode realizes remarkable rate capability of 67&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 50C and a long&#8208;term lifespan over 10&#160;000 cycles (capacity retention of 81.3%). Theoretical calculations further illustrate that the weak binding of Na+ ion in the channel is responsible for the rapid Na+ diffusion, accounting for the superior reaction kinetics. Moreover, rigid MEO6 octahedral and feasible rearrangement of Na+ ions can suppress the phase transition, thus endowing an ultrastable ME&#8208;NVP cathode. This work highlights the significant role of medium&#8208;entropy engineering in advancing the output voltage, cycling stability, and rate capability of polyanionic cathodes.

         <title>An OMV&#8208;Based Nanovaccine as Antigen Presentation Signal Enhancer for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article introduces the &#8220;Antigen Presentation Signal Enhancer&#8221; (APSE), a novel tumor vaccine platform using bacterial outer membrane vesicles loaded with tumor antigens and modified with &#945;PD&#8208;L1 antibodies. By activating and boosting co&#8208;stimulatory signals in antigen&#8208;presenting cells, APSE overcomes low antigen presentation efficiency caused by high PD&#8208;L1 expression, offering the potential to improve cancer vaccine efficacy, especially for less immunogenic tumors.









Abstract
Antigen&#8208;presenting cells (APCs) process tumor vaccines and present tumor antigens as the first signals to T cells to activate anti&#8208;tumor immunity, which process requires the assistance of co&#8208;stimulatory second signals on APCs. The immune checkpoint programmed death ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) not only mediates the immune escape of tumor cells but also acts as a co&#8208;inhibitory second signal on APCs. The serious dysfunction of second signals due to the high expression of PD&#8208;L1 on APCs in the tumor body results in the inefficiency of tumor vaccines. To overcome this challenge, a previously established Plug&#8208;and&#8208;Display tumor vaccine platform based on bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) is developed into an &#8220;Antigen Presentation Signal Enhancer&#8221; (APSE) by surface&#8208;modifying PD&#8208;L1 antibodies (&#945;PD&#8208;L1). While delivering tumor antigens, APSE can activate the expression of co&#8208;stimulatory second signals in APCs due to the high immunogenicity of OMVs. More importantly, the surface&#8208;modified &#945;PD&#8208;L1 binds to the co&#8208;inhibitory signals PD&#8208;L1, potentially restoring CD80 function and ensuring efficient co&#8208;stimulatory second signals and activation of anti&#8208;tumor immunity. The results reveal the importance of PD&#8208;L1 blockage in the initiation process of anti&#8208;tumor immunity, and the second signal modulation capability of APSE can expand the application potential of cancer vaccines to less immunogenic malignancies.

         <title>Engineering Highly Aligned and Densely Populated Cardiac Muscle Bundles via Fibrin Remodeling in 3D&#8208;Printed Anisotropic Microfibrous Lattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents the development of 3D&#8208;printed anisotropic InterPore microfibrous lattices for engineering aligned and densely populated cardiac muscle bundles. By promoting cardiomyocyte alignment and facilitating cell&#8208;mediated remodeling in these lattices, the approach improves high&#8208;density tissue organization, enhances electrophysiological function, and supports the maturation of cardiac tissues.








Abstract
Replicating the structural and functional features of native myocardium, particularly its high&#8208;density cellular alignment and efficient electrical connectivity, is essential for engineering functional cardiac tissues. Here, novel electrohydrodynamically printed InterPore microfibrous lattices with anisotropic architectures are introduced to promote high&#8208;density cellular alignment and enhanced tissue interconnectivity. The interconnected pores in the microfibrous lattice enable dynamic, cell&#8208;mediated remodeling of fibrous hydrogels, resulting in continuous, mechanically stable tissue bundles. Compared to lattices with isolated pores, the engineered aligned cardiac tissues from neonatal rat cardiomyocytes exhibit improved electrophysiological properties and synchronous contractions. Using a multiseeding strategy, an equivalent cell seeding density of 8 &#215; 107 cells&#160;mL&#8722;1, facilitating the formation of multicellular, vascularized cardiac structures with maintained tissue viability and integrity, is achieved. As a demonstration, human&#8208;induced pluripotent stem cell&#8208;derived cardiac tissues are engineered with progressive maturation and functional integration over time. These findings underscore the potential of InterPore microfibrous lattices for applications in cardiac tissue engineering, drug discovery, and therapeutic development.

         <title>3D Printed Titanium Scaffolds with Bi&#8208;Directional Gradient QK&#8208;Functionalized Surface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents the development of a 3D&#8208;printed modular porous titanium scaffold utilizing a gradient&#8208;surface strategy to immobilize QK peptide with a bi&#8208;directional gradient, characterized by high peptide density in the interior and low density at both ends. This design can effectively promote cell migration from the scaffold ends toward the interior, thereby enhancing vascularization and osteointegration.








Abstract
3D printed titanium scaffold has promising applications in orthopedics. However, the bioinert titanium presents challenges for promoting vascularization and tissue growth within the porous scaffold for stable osteointegration. In this study, a modular porous titanium scaffold is created using 3D printing and a gradient&#8208;surface strategy to immobilize QK peptide on the surface with a bi&#8208;directional gradient distribution. This design featured high peptide density in the interior and low peptide density on both ends, aiming to induce cell migration from ends to interior and subsequently enhance vascularization and osteointegration within the scaffold. In vitro results showed that besides the inherent bioactivity, the gradient distribution of QK positively correlated with endothelial cell migration and promoted angiogenesis. In vivo assay was performed by a segmental bone defect model in rabbit and a spine repair model in sheep. Various staining and Micro&#8208;CT results demonstrated that compared to that with uniformly QK&#8208;functionalized surface, the scaffold with bi&#8208;directional gradient QK&#8208;functionalized surface (Ti&#8208;G) significantly encouraged new tissue growth toward the interior of the scaffold, subsequently facilitated angiogenesis and osteointegration. This study provides an effective strategy for enhancing the bioactivity of peptide&#8208;functionalized scaffolds through the concept of bi&#8208;directional gradients, and holds potential for various 3D printed scaffolds.

         <title>Overcoming Energy&#8208;Scaling Barriers: Efficient Ammonia Electrosynthesis on High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;elemental synergy strategy for regulating the local electronic structure is applied to create a broad adsorption energy landscape in high&#8208;entropy alloy catalysts. This approach enables optimal adsorption and desorption of various intermediates in the multi&#8208;step NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion, effectively overcoming energy&#8208;scaling limitations for efficient NH3 electrosynthesis.








Abstract
Electrochemically converting nitrate (NO3&#8722;) to value&#8208;added ammonia (NH3) is a complex process involving an eight&#8208;electron transfer and numerous intermediates, presenting a significant challenge for optimization. A multi&#8208;elemental synergy strategy to regulate the local electronic structure at the atomic level is proposed, creating a broad adsorption energy landscape in high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) catalysts. This approach enables optimal adsorption and desorption of various intermediates, effectively overcoming energy&#8208;scaling limitations for efficient NH3 electrosynthesis. The HEA catalyst achieved a high Faradaic efficiency of 94.5&#160;&#177;&#160;4.3% and a yield rate of 10.2&#160;&#177;&#160;0.5&#160;mg h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1. It also demonstrated remarkable stability over 250 h in an integrated three&#8208;chamber device, coupling electrocatalysis with an ammonia recovery unit for continuous NH3 collection.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrochemically converting nitrate (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) to value-added ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is a complex process involving an eight-electron transfer and numerous intermediates, presenting a significant challenge for optimization. A multi-elemental synergy strategy to regulate the local electronic structure at the atomic level is proposed, creating a broad adsorption energy landscape in high-entropy alloy (HEA) catalysts. This approach enables optimal adsorption and desorption of various intermediates, effectively overcoming energy-scaling limitations for efficient NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; electrosynthesis. The HEA catalyst achieved a high Faradaic efficiency of 94.5&#160;&#177;&#160;4.3% and a yield rate of 10.2&#160;&#177;&#160;0.5&#160;mg h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; mg&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. It also demonstrated remarkable stability over 250 h in an integrated three-chamber device, coupling electrocatalysis with an ammonia recovery unit for continuous NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; collection. This work elucidates the catalytic mechanisms of multi-functional HEA systems and offers new perspectives for optimizing multi-step reactions by circumventing adsorption-energy scaling limitations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Observation of Large Low&#8208;Field Magnetoresistance in Layered (NdNiO3)n:NdO Films at High Temperatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work obtains a notable low&#8208;field magnetoresistance (1.2 &#215; 103%, 0.1 T) in the layered (NdNiO3)n:NdO films at a high temperature range (190&#8211;240 K). Such layered phases raise the tunneling barriers and magnetic fluctuations at high temperatures, where small ferromagnetic domains are embedded in the antiferromagnetic domains. The achievement of such notable LFMR at high temperatures will advance the magnetic devices.








Abstract
Large low&#8208;field magnetoresistance (LFMR, &lt;&#160;1 T), related to the spin&#8208;disorder scattering or spin&#8208;polarized tunneling at boundaries of polycrystalline manganates, holds considerable promise for the development of low&#8208;power and ultrafast magnetic devices. However, achieving significant LFMR&#160;typically necessitates extremely low temperatures due to diminishing spin polarization as temperature rises. To address this challenge, one strategy involves incorporating Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper structures (ABO3)n:AO, which are layered derivatives of perovskite structure capable of potentially inducing heightened magnetic fluctuations at higher temperatures. Here, a remarkable LFMR of up to 1.0&#215;103% is obtained in the layered (NdNiO3)n:NdO films with a high and wide temperature range (190&#8211;240 K). This finding underlines that the layered (NdNiO3)n:NdO (n = 1) structure show a complex magnetic structure above TMI of perovskite NdNiO3, where small ferromagnetic domains are embedded in the antiferromagnetic domains, raising the tunneling barriers and magnetic fluctuations at high temperatures. Furthermore, applying a low magnetic field (&lt;0.1 T) near TMI effectively mitigates the disruption of antiferromagnetic order structures at boundaries, then a higher temperature is required to break the inhibition of ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic phase transition. The results contribute significantly to the advancement of magnetic devices capable of achieving substantial LFMR at room temperature.

         <title>Mesoporous Boron&#8208;Doped Carbon with Curved B4C Active Sites for Highly Efficient H2O2 Electrosynthesis in Neutral Media and Air&#8208;Supplied Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mesoporous B&#8208;doped carbon (meso&#8208;BPC) with highly efficient curved B4C active sites for 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction&#160;catalyst under a neutral electrolyte is reported. Combining experiments with dentity functional theory&#160;calculations, it is revealed that the mesoporous structure and B4C active site on the curved carbon surface significantly improve the oxygen supply and catalytic activity at high current densities and air&#8208;supplied environments.









Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) electrosynthesis via the 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is considered as a cost&#8208;effective and safe alternative to the energy&#8208;intensive anthraquinone process. However, in more practical environments, namely, the use of neutral media and air&#8208;fed cathode environments, slow ORR kinetics and insufficient oxygen supply pose significant challenges to efficient H2O2 production at high current densities. In this work, mesoporous B&#8208;doped carbons with novel curved B4C active sites, synthesized via a carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction using a pore&#8208;former agent, to simultaneously achieve excellent 2e&#8722; ORR activity and improved mass transfer properties are introduced. Through a combination of experimental analysis and theoretical calculations, it is confirmed that the curved B4C configuration, formed by mesopores in the carbon, demonstrates superior selectivity and activity for 2e&#8722; ORR due to its weaker interaction with *OOH intermediates compared to planar B4C in neutral media. Moreover, the mesopores facilitate oxygen supply and suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction, achieving a Faradaic efficiency of 86.2% at 150&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 under air&#8208;supplied conditions, along with an impressive O2 utilization efficiency of 93.6%. This approach will provide a route to catalyst design for efficient H2O2 electrosynthesis in a practical environment.

         <title>Scalable Synthesis of 2D ErOCl with Sub&#8208;meV Narrow Emissions at Telecom Band</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Centimeter&#8208;size, uniform 2D ErOCl film, and diverse 2D rare&#8208;earth materials are grown using self&#8208;encapsulation strategy. 2D ErOCl possesses high crystalline quality, excellent ambient and thermal stability. 2D ErOCl exhibits outstanding optical properties, featuring sub&#8208;meV narrow emissions at the telecom C&#8208;band. These emissions are tunable with external magnetic fields, highlighting their potential for advanced optical applications.








Abstract
Van der Waals (vdWs) materials are promising candidates for hetero&#8208;integration with silicon photonics toward miniaturization and integration. VdWs materials like molybdenum telluride and black phosphorus, despite being prominent, exhibit air sensitivity, and their room temperature emissions can be significantly broadened by tens of meV. Here, a self&#8208;encapsulation strategy is developed to scalably synthesize robust 2D vdWs ErOCl with sub&#8208;meV narrow emissions at the telecom C&#8208;band. Diverse 2D rare earth materials are also grown via chemical vapor deposition (TmOCl, YbOCl, HoOCl, DyOCl, SmOCl, NdOCl, TbOCl, GdOCl, EuOCl, and PrOCl), demonstrating the strategy's generalizability. The as&#8208;grown ErOCl exhibits high crystalline quality and excellent ambient&#160;and thermal stability (300&#160;&#176;C). Photoluminescence analysis reveals a series of narrow emissions across the visible to near&#8208;infrared spectrum. The ErOCl's emission at the telecom band is narrowest among 2D luminescent materials, and suitable for integrating with photonic chips. Temperature&#8208;dependent photoluminescence spectra facilitate the understanding of emission mechanisms, analyzed using a crystal field perturbation model. Moreover, these emissions can be tuned by external magnetic fields. This research not only pioneers a novel strategy for synthesizing 2D rare earth materials but also paves the way for innovative building blocks in the realm of on&#8208;chip optical communications.

         <title>Leveraging Optical Anisotropy of the Morpho Butterfly Wing for Quantitative, Stain&#8208;Free, and Contact&#8208;Free Assessment of Biological Tissue Microstructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We leverage the intrinsic optical anisotropy of the Morpho butterfly wing to introduce Morpho&#8208;Enhanced Polarized Light Microscopy (MorE&#8208;PoL), a stain&#8208; and contact&#8208;free imaging methodology that quantitatively assesses the microstructural properties of fibrous biological tissues. We demonstrate the potential of MorE&#8208;PoL with patient&#8208;derived xenograft breast cancer tissues, where we quantify the density and organization of fibrillar collagen in the tumor microenvironment.









Abstract
Changes in the density and organization of fibrous biological tissues often accompany the progression of serious diseases ranging from fibrosis to neurodegenerative diseases, heart disease and cancer. However, challenges in cost, complexity, or precision faced by existing imaging methodologies and materials pose barriers to elucidating the role of tissue microstructure in disease. Here, we leverage the intrinsic optical anisotropy of the Morpho butterfly wing and introduce Morpho&#8208;Enhanced Polarized Light Microscopy (MorE&#8208;PoL), a stain&#8208; and contact&#8208;free imaging platform that enhances and quantifies the birefringent material properties of fibrous biological tissues. We develop a mathematical model, based on Jones calculus, which describes fibrous tissue density and organization. As a representative example, we analyzed collagen&#8208;dense and collagen&#8208;sparse human breast cancer tissue sections and leverage our technique to assess the microstructural properties of distinct regions of interest. We compare our results with conventional Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) staining procedures and second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy for fibrillar collagen detection. Our findings demonstrate that our MorE&#8208;PoL technique provides a robust, quantitative, and accessible route toward analyzing biological tissue microstructures, with great potential for application to a broad range of biological materials.

     alt="Leveraging Optical Anisotropy of the Morpho Butterfly Wing for Quantitative, Stain-Free, and Contact-Free Assessment of Biological Tissue Microstructures"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We leverage the intrinsic optical anisotropy of the Morpho butterfly wing to introduce Morpho-Enhanced Polarized Light Microscopy (MorE-PoL), a stain- and contact-free imaging methodology that quantitatively assesses the microstructural properties of fibrous biological tissues. We demonstrate the potential of MorE-PoL with patient-derived xenograft breast cancer tissues, where we quantify the density and organization of fibrillar collagen in the tumor microenvironment.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changes in the density and organization of fibrous biological tissues often accompany the progression of serious diseases ranging from fibrosis to neurodegenerative diseases, heart disease and cancer. However, challenges in cost, complexity, or precision faced by existing imaging methodologies and materials pose barriers to elucidating the role of tissue microstructure in disease. Here, we leverage the intrinsic optical anisotropy of the Morpho butterfly wing and introduce Morpho-Enhanced Polarized Light Microscopy (MorE-PoL), a stain- and contact-free imaging platform that enhances and quantifies the birefringent material properties of fibrous biological tissues. We develop a mathematical model, based on Jones calculus, which describes fibrous tissue density and organization. As a representative example, we analyzed collagen-dense and collagen-sparse human breast cancer tissue sections and leverage our technique to assess the microstructural properties of distinct regions of interest. We compare our results with conventional Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;amp;E) staining procedures and second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy for fibrillar collagen detection. Our findings demonstrate that our MorE-PoL technique provides a robust, quantitative, and accessible route toward analyzing biological tissue microstructures, with great potential for application to a broad range of biological materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Aerosol CVD Carbon Nanotube Thin Films: From Synthesis to Advanced Applications: A Comprehensive Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aerosol chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is a cutting&#8208;edge method for producing carbon nanotube (CNT) thin films through gas&#8208;phase synthesis and filtration collection. The films exhibit exceptional electrical, optical, and mechanical properties. This review provides comprehensive guidelines from synthesis to applications, emphasizing how precise control of aerosol CVD parameters enables scalability and enhances commercial viability across diverse technological applications.








Abstract
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) produced by the floating&#8208;catalyst chemical vapor deposition (FCCVD) method are among the most promising nanomaterials of today, attracting interest from both academic and industrial sectors. These CNTs exhibit exceptional electrical conductivity, optical properties, and mechanical resilience due to their binder&#8208;free and low&#8208;defect structure, while the FCCVD method enables their continuous and scalable synthesis. Among the methodological FCCVD variations, aerosol CVD&#8217; is distinguished by its production of freestanding thin films comprising macroscale CNT networks, which exhibit superior performance and practical applicability. This review elucidates the complex interrelations between aerosol CVD reactor synthesis conditions and the resulting properties of the CNTs. A unified approach connecting all stages of the synthesis process is proposed as a comprehensive guide. This review examines the correlations between CNT structural parameters (length and diameter) and resultant film properties (conductivity, optical, and mechanical characteristics) to establish a comprehensive framework for optimizing CNT thin film synthesis. The analysis encompasses characterization methodologies specific to aerosol CVD&#8208;synthesized CNTs and evaluates how their properties influence applications across diverse domains, from energy devices to optoelectronics. The review concludes by addressing current challenges and prospects in this field.

         <title>Beyond Inducing Anionic Redox: Controllable Migration Sequence of Li Ions in Transition Metal Layers Toward Highly Stable Li&#8208;Rich Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The extra role of Li ions in transition metal layers (LiTM) beyond inducing oxygen redox is revealed in the Li&#8208;rich oxide Li2Ru0.75Zr0.25O3. The preferential migration of LiTM, which can be achieved by proper cation regulation, plays an imperative role in preventing the structural transformation by postponing the slab gliding of the layered structure.








Abstract
The energy density of layered oxides of Li&#8208;ion batteries can be enhanced by inducing oxygen redox through replacing transition metal (TM) ions with Li ions in the TM layer. Undesirably, the cathodes always suffer from unfavorable structural degradation, which is closely associated with irreversible TM migration and slab gliding, resulting in continuous capacity and voltage decay. Herein, attention is paid to the Li ions in the TM layer (LiTM) and find their extra effects beyond inducing oxygen redox, which has been rarely mentioned. With the aid of 7Li solid&#8208;state NMR and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the controllable migration of LiTM is verified. The mystery is uncovered that the preferential migration of LiTM plays an imperative role in preventing the structural transformation by postponing the slab gliding of the layered structure. Integrated with the inhibited TM migration, the structural robustness and reversibility of Li2RuO3 can be drastically improved after Zr&#8208;substitution, providing a solid foundation for achieving ultra&#8208;stable electrochemical performance even after thousands of cycles (2500 cycles). The discovery highlights the significance of LiTM with respect to the structural robustness and provides a potential route toward high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Electric Field&#8208;Induced Nonreciprocal Directional Dichroism in a Time&#8208;Reversal&#8208;Odd Antiferromagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electric field&#8208;induced nonreciprocal directional dichroism (E&#8208;induced NDD) ascribed to the diagonal electrotoroidic effect is discovered in a time&#8208;reversal&#8208;odd antiferromagnet Co&#8322;SiO&#8324; possessing a time&#8208;reversal&#8208;odd scalar quantity, magnetic toroidal monopole. Spatial distribution measurements of E&#8208;induced NDD reveal domain structures. Magnetic field&#8208;induced domain inversion mediated by the piezomagnetic effect highlights the rich physics of time&#8208;reversal&#8208;odd antiferromagnets.








Abstract
Antiferromagnets with broken time&#8208;reversal (T$\mathcal{T}$) symmetry (T$\mathcal{T}$&#8208;odd antiferromagnets) have gained extensive attention, mainly due to their ferromagnet&#8208;like behavior despite the absence of net magnetization. However, certain types of T$\mathcal{T}$&#8208;odd antiferromagnets remain inaccessible by the typical ferromagnet&#8208;like phenomena (e.g., anomalous Hall effect). One such system is characterized by a T$\mathcal{T}$&#8208;odd scalar quantity, the magnetic toroidal monopole. To access the broken T$\mathcal{T}$ symmetry in such a system, a unique nonreciprocal optical phenomenon, electric field&#8208;induced nonreciprocal directional dichroism (E&#8208;induced NDD), is employed. Signals of E&#8208;induced NDD are successfully detected in a T$\mathcal{T}$&#8208;odd antiferromagnet, Co&#8322;SiO&#8324;, whose magnetic structure is characterized by the magnetic toroidal monopole. Furthermore, by spatially resolving the E&#8208;induced NDD, spatial distributions of a pair of domain states related to one another by the T$\mathcal{T}$ operation are visualized. The domain imaging revealed the inversion of the domain pattern by applying a magnetic field, which is explained by trilinear coupling attributed to the piezomagnetic effect. The observation of E&#8208;induced NDD highlights unique functionalities of T$\mathcal{T}$&#8208;odd antiferromagnets.

         <title>Scalable Synaptic Transistor Memory from Solution&#8208;Processed Carbon Nanotubes for High&#8208;Speed Neuromorphic Data Processing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 2, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scalable synaptic transistor memory from solution&#8208;processed carbon nanotubes, exhibiting&#160;reconfigurable weights and long&#8208;term synaptic plasticity, enables parallel neuromorphic data processing with a speed of 1 M bit per second per input channel.








Abstract
Neural networks as a core information processing technology in machine learning and artificial intelligence demand substantial computational resources to deal with the extensive multiply&#8208;accumulate operations. Neuromorphic computing is an emergent solution to address this problem, allowing the computation performed in memory arrays in parallel with high efficiencies conforming to the neural networks. Here, scalable synaptic transistor memories are developed from solution&#8208;sorted carbon nanotubes. The transistors exhibit a large switching ratio of over 105, a significant memory window of &#8776;12&#160;V arising from charge trapping, and low response delays down to tens of nanoseconds. These device characteristics endow highly stabilized reconfigurable conductance states, successful emulation of synaptic functions, and a high data processing speed. Importantly, the devices exhibit uniform characteristic metrics, e.g., with a 1.8% variation in the memory window, suggesting an industrial&#8208;scale manufacturing capability of the fabrication. Using the memories, a hardware convolution kernel is designed and parallel image processing is demonstrated at a speed of 1&#160;M bit per second per input channel. Given the efficacy of the convolution kernel, a promising prospect of the memories in implementing neuromorphic computing is envisaged. To explore the potential, large&#8208;scale convolution kernels are simulated and high&#8208;speed video processing is realized for autonomous driving.

         <title>Magnesium Nanocomposite Hydrogel Reverses the Pathologies to Enhance Mandible Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 2, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The innovative design offers an injectable bone substitute that addresses various detrimental pathologies associated with medication&#8208;related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ). It promotes vascularization, reduces inflammation, activates stem cells, and inhibits pathogens. The convenient implantation, assistance in blood clotting, and robust osteopromotive effects make it a promising solution for filling irregular bone defects and realizing functional regeneration.








Abstract
The healing of bone defects after debridement in medication&#8208;related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) is a challenging medical condition with impaired angiogenesis, susceptible infection, and pro&#8208;inflammatory responses. Magnesium (Mg) nanocomposite hydrogel is developed to specifically tackle multiple factors involved in MRONJ. Mg&#8208;oxide nanoparticles tune the gelation kinetics in the reaction between N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide&#8208;functionalized hyperbranched poly (ethylene glycol) and proteins. This reaction allows an enhanced mechanical property after instant solidification and, more importantly, also stable gelation in challenging environments such as wet and hemorrhagic conditions. The synthesized hydrogel guides mandible regeneration in MRONJ rats by triggering the formation of type H vessels, activating Osterix+ osteoprogenitor cells, and generating anti&#8208;inflammatory microenvironments. Additionally, this approach demonstrates its ability to suppress infection by inhibiting specific pathogens while strengthening stress tolerance in the affected alveolar bone. Furthermore, the enhanced osteogenic properties and feasibility of implantation of the hydrogel are validated in mandible defect and iliac crest defect created in minipigs, respectively. Collectively, this study offers an injectable and innovative bone substitute to enhance mandible defect healing by tackling multiple detrimental pathologies.

         <title>Transcriptome&#8208;Optimized Hydrogel Design of a Stem Cell Niche for Enhanced Tendon Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 2, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a pioneering materiomics approach to rationally design a stem cell&#8208;laden hydrogel (TenoGel) for tendon repair. Unlike traditional biomaterial empiricism, this systematic, data&#8208;driven strategy integrates RNA&#8208;seq bioinformatics and mathematical modeling, providing in&#8208;depth mechanistic insights with quantitative assessment and prediction of optimal tenogenic design parameters. This presents a transformative advancement in biomaterial engineering for regenerative medicine.








Abstract
Bioactive hydrogels have emerged as promising artificial niches for enhancing stem cell&#8208;mediated tendon repair. However, a substantial knowledge gap remains regarding the optimal combination of niche features for targeted cellular responses, which often leads to lengthy development cycles and uncontrolled healing outcomes. To address this critical gap, an innovative, data&#8208;driven materiomics strategy is developed. This approach is based on in&#8208;house RNA&#8208;seq data that integrates bioinformatics and mathematical modeling, which is a significant departure from traditional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error methods. It aims to provide both mechanistic insights and quantitative assessments and predictions of the tenogenic effects of adipose&#8208;derived stem cells induced by systematically modulated features of a tendon&#8208;mimetic hydrogel (TenoGel). The knowledge generated has enabled a rational approach for TenoGel design, addressing key considerations, such as tendon extracellular matrix concentration, uniaxial tensile loading, and in vitro pre&#8208;conditioning duration. Remarkably, our optimized TenoGel demonstrated robust tenogenesis in vitro and facilitated tendon regeneration while preventing undesired ectopic ossification in a rat tendon injury model. These findings shed light on the importance of tailoring hydrogel features for efficient tendon repair. They also highlight the tremendous potential of the innovative materiomics strategy as a powerful predictive and assessment tool in biomaterial development for regenerative medicine.

         <title>Extracellular Silica Nanomatrices Promote In Vitro Maturation of Anti&#8208;tumor Dendritic Cells via Activation of Focal Adhesion Kinase</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 2, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silica nanozigzags (NZs) facilitate the in vitro maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) via mechanoactivation of focal adhesion kinase. The NZ&#8208;maturated DCs in vitro prime the cytotoxic T&#8208;lymphocytes (CTLs) into the programmed cell death protein&#8208;1 (PD&#8208;1)lowCD44high effector memory CTLs, and in vivo suppress the growth of tumors, indicating a promising new strategy for cancer immunotherapy.








Abstract
The efficacy of dendritic cell (DC)&#8208;based cancer vaccines is critically determined by the functionalities of in vitro maturated DCs. The maturation of DCs typically relies on chemicals that are cytotoxic or hinder the ability of DCs to efficiently activate the antigen&#8208;specific cytotoxic T&#8208;lymphocytes (CTLs) against tumors. Herein, the maturation chemicals are replaced with extracellular silica nanomatrices, fabricated by glancing angle deposition, to promote in vitro maturation of murine bone marrow&#8208;derived DCs (mBMDCs). The extracellular nanomatrices composed of silica nanozigzags (NZs) enable the generation of mature mBMDCs with upregulated levels of co&#8208;stimulatory molecules, C&#8208;C chemokine receptor type&#8208;7, X&#8208;C motif chemokine recetpor&#8208;1, DC&#8208;specific ICAM&#8208;3 grabbing nonintegrin, and enhanced endocytic capacity. The in vitro maturation is partially governed by focal adhesion kinase (FAK) that is mechanically activated in the curved cell adhesions formed at the DC&#8208;NZ interfaces. The NZ&#8208;maturated mBMDCs can prime the antigen&#8208;specific CTLs into programmed cell death protein&#8208;1 (PD&#8208;1)lowCD44high memory phenotypes in vitro and suppress the growth of tumors in vivo. Meanwhile, the NZ&#8208;mediated beneficial effects are also observed in human monocyte&#8208;derived DCs. This work demonstrates that the silica NZs promote the anti&#8208;tumor capacity of in vitro maturated DCs via the mechanoactivation of FAK, supporting the potential of silica NZs being a promising biomaterial for cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Angular&#8208;Inertia Regulated Stable and Nanoscale Sensing of Single Molecules Using Nanopore&#8208;In&#8208;A&#8208;Tube</title>

The study develops a nanopore&#8208;in&#8208;a&#8208;tube (NIAT) device that precisely regulates molecule translocation in a funnel&#8208;shaped nanopore by controlling the inertial angle and centrifugation speed in a centrifuge. This ensures stable signal readout with a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio, enabling nanoscale sensing of single molecules.








Abstract
Nanopore is commonly used for high&#8208;resolution, label&#8208;free sensing, and analysis of single molecules. However, controlling the speed and trajectory of molecular translocation in nanopores remains challenging, hampering sensing accuracy. Here, the study proposes a nanopore&#8208;in&#8208;a&#8208;tube (NIAT) device that enables decoupling of the current signal detection from molecular translocation and provides precise angular inertia&#8208;kinetic translocation of single molecules through a nanopore, thus ensuring stable signal readout with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (SNR). Specifically, the funnel&#8208;shaped silicon nanopore, fabricated at a 10&#8208;nm resolution, is placed into a centrifugal tube. A light&#8208;induced photovoltaic effect is utilized to achieve a counter&#8208;balanced state of electrokinetic effects in the nanopore. By controlling the inertial angle and centrifugation speed, the angular inertial force is harnessed effectively for regulating the translocation process with high precision. Consequently, the speed and trajectory of the molecules are able to be adjusted in and around the nanopore, enabling controllable and high SNR current signals. Numerical simulation reveals the decisive role of inertial angle in achieving uniform translocation trajectories and enhancing analyte&#8208;nanopore interactions. The performance of the device is validated by discriminating rigid Au nanoparticles with a 1.6&#8208;nm size difference and differentiating a 1.3&#8208;nm size difference and subtle stiffness variations in flexible polyethylene glycol molecules.

         <title>Photo&#8208;metallo&#8208;immunotherapy: Fabricating Chromium&#8208;Based Nanocomposites to Enhance CAR&#8208;T Cell Infiltration and Cytotoxicity against Solid Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 2, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chromium nanoparticles (Cr NPs) coated with a layer of biodegradable polydopamine can empower the chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)&#8208;T cell therapy against solid tumors. Upon laser irradiation, the induced hyperthermia can &#8220;warm&#8221; the &#8220;cold&#8221; tumor microenvironment (TME) and boost the therapeutic effect of CAR&#8208;T cells. The Cr3+ ions released can also promote the CAR&#8208;T cell migration and infiltration for effective inhibition of tumor growth in tumor&#8208;bearing mice.








Abstract
The infiltration and cytotoxicity of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)&#8208;T cells are crucial for effective elimination of solid tumors. While metallo&#8208;immunotherapy is a promising strategy that can activate the antitumor immunity, its role in promoting CAR&#8208;T cell therapy remains elusive. The first single&#8208;element nanomaterial based on chromium nanoparticles (Cr NPs) for cancer photo&#8208;metallo&#8208;immunotherapy has been reported previously.

&lt;p&gt;Chromium nanoparticles (Cr NPs) coated with a layer of biodegradable polydopamine can empower the chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy against solid tumors. Upon laser irradiation, the induced hyperthermia can &#8220;warm&#8221; the &#8220;cold&#8221; tumor microenvironment (TME) and boost the therapeutic effect of CAR-T cells. The Cr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions released can also promote the CAR-T cell migration and infiltration for effective inhibition of tumor growth in tumor-bearing mice.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The infiltration and cytotoxicity of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells are crucial for effective elimination of solid tumors. While metallo-immunotherapy is a promising strategy that can activate the antitumor immunity, its role in promoting CAR-T cell therapy remains elusive. The first single-element nanomaterial based on chromium nanoparticles (Cr NPs) for cancer photo-metallo-immunotherapy has been reported previously. Herein, an extended study using biodegradable polydopamine as a versatile carrier for these nanoparticles, enabling synergistic CAR-T cell therapy, is reported. The results show that these nanocomposites with or without further encapsulation of the anticancer drug alpelisib can promote the CAR-T cell migration and antitumor effect. Upon irradiation with near-infrared light, they caused mild hyperthermia that can &#8220;warm&#8221; the &#8220;cold&#8221; tumor microenvironment (TME). The administration of B7-H3 CAR-T cells to NOD severe combined immunodeficiency gamma mice bearing a human hepatoma or PIK3CA-mutated breast tumor can significantly inhibit the tumor growth after the induction of tumor hyperthermia by the nanocomposites and promote the secretion of serum cytokines, including IL-2, IFN-&#947;, and TNF-&#945;. The trivalent Cr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions, which are the major degradation product of these nanocomposites, can increase the CXCL13 and CCL3 chemokine expressions to generate tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) in the tumor tissues, facilitating the CAR-T cell infiltration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Topological Parametric Phonon Oscillator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 2, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A topological parametric phonon oscillator is experimentally realized based on a nonlinear nano&#8208;electromechanical Dirac&#8208;vortex cavity with strong squeezed interaction. Fabrication&#8208;disorder&#8208;induced random frequency variation can be suppressed effectively by increasing the cavity size, while the free spectral range reduces at a much slower rate. These results represent an important advance in topological physics with large bosonic nonlinearities and parametric gain.








Abstract
Topological bosonic systems have recently aroused intense interests in exploring exotic phenomena that have no counterparts in electronic systems. The squeezed bosonic interaction in these systems is particularly interesting, because it can modify the vacuum fluctuations of topological states, drive them into instabilities, and lead to topological parametric oscillators. However, these phenomena remain experimentally elusive because of limited nonlinearities in most existing topological bosonic systems. Here, a topological parametric phonon oscillator is experimentally realized based on a nonlinear nano&#8208;electromechanical Dirac&#8208;vortex cavity with strong squeezed interaction. Specifically, the Dirac&#8208;vortex cavity is parametrically driven to provide phase&#8208;sensitive amplification for topological phonons, leading to the observation of coherent parametric phonon oscillation above the threshold. Additionally, it is confirmed that the random frequency variation caused by fabrication disorders can be suppressed effectively by increasing the cavity size while the free spectral range reduces at a much slower rate, which benefits the realization of large&#8208;area single&#8208;mode lasers. These results represent an important advance in experimental investigations of topological physics with large bosonic nonlinearities and parametric gain.

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Homing Phage Nanofibers for Nanozyme&#8208;Enhanced Targeted Breast Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 2, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Genetically engineered phages display a nanozyme&#8208;nucleating peptide on the sidewall and a tumor&#8208;homing peptide at the tip. They site&#8208;specifically nucleate Pt nanozyme on the sidewall. The resultant phages can home to breast tumor and catalyze the conversion of tumoral hydrogen peroxide into oxygen. This strategy solves the problem of tumor hypoxia and improves the efficacy of photodynamic cancer therapy.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) eliminates cancer cells by converting endogenous oxygen into reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, its efficacy is significantly hindered by hypoxia in solid tumors. Hence, to engineer filamentous fd phage, a human&#8208;friendly bacteria&#8208;specific virus is proposed, into a nanozyme&#8208;nucleating photosensitizer&#8208;loaded tumor&#8208;homing nanofiber for enhanced production of ROS in a hypoxic tumor. Specifically, Pt&#8208;binding and tumor&#8208;homing peptides are genetically displayed on the sidewall and tip of the fd phage, respectively. The Pt&#8208;binding peptides induced nucleation and orientation of Pt nanozymes (PtNEs) on the sidewall of the phage. The resultant PtNE&#8208;coated tumor&#8208;homing phage exhibits significantly enhanced sustained catalytic conversion of hydrogen peroxide in hypoxic tumors into O2 for producing ROS needed for PDT, compared to non&#8208;phage&#8208;templated PtNE. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations verify the catalytic mechanism of the phage&#8208;templated PtNE. After intravenous injection of the PtNE&#8208;coated indocyanine green (ICG)&#8208;loaded tumor&#8208;homing phages into breast tumor&#8208;bearing mice, the nanofibers home to the tumors and effectively inhibit tumor growth by the PtNE&#8208;enhanced PDT. The nanofibers can also serve as a tumor&#8208;homing imaging probe due to the fluorescence of ICG. This work demonstrates that filamentous phage, engineered to become tumor&#8208;homing nanozyme&#8208;nucleating tumor&#8208;hypoxia&#8208;relieving nanofibers, can act as cancer&#8208;targeting nanozymes with improved catalytic performance for effective targeted PDT.

Magnesium Nanocomposite Hydrogel
Inspired by &#8220;Jingwei Reclamation&#8221;, the cover with a phoenix, symbolizes nirvana and rebirth, representing hope and resilience in challenging environments. The phoenix utilizes magnesium nanocomposite hydrogel as a &#8220;stone&#8221; to fill the vast sea that represents challenging mandible defects. The surrounding mountains intricately portray the structure of trabecular bones. The shape of phoenix and hydrogel looks like &#8220;60&#8221;, celebrating the 60th anniversary of CUHK. More details can be found in article number 2312920 by Ling Qin, Jiankun Xu, and co&#8208;workers.

         <title>3D Nanofabrication via Directed Material Assembly: Mechanism, Method, and Future</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 2, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guided material assembly, as an important mechanism of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) nanofabrication, has led to breakthroughs in fabrication resolution, material generality, and throughput, and enabled numerous new opportunities for nanotechnology. This review summarizes recent advances in this promising strategy with an emphasis on the synergy among different microscopic driving forces with different regioselective designs to achieve nanoscale assembly precision and sophisticated 3D structure design.








Abstract
Fabrication of complex three&#8208;dimensional (3D) structures at nanoscale is the core of nanotechnology, as it enables the creation of various micro&#8208;/nano&#8208;devices such as micro&#8208;robots, metamaterials, sensors, photonic devices, etc. Among most 3D nanofabrication strategies, the guided material assembly, an efficient bottom&#8208;up approach capable of directly constructing designed structures from precise integration of material building blocks, possesses compelling advantages in diverse material compatibility, sufficient driving forces, facile processing steps, and nanoscale resolution. In this review, we focus on assembly&#8208;based fabrication methods capable of creating complex 3D nanostructures (instead of periodic or 2.5D&#8208;only structures). Recent advances are classified based on the different assembly mechanisms, i.e., assembly driven by chemical reactions, physical interactions, and the synergy of multiple microscopic interactions. The design principles of representative fabrication strategies with an emphasis on their respective advantages, e.g., structural design flexibility, material compatibility, resolution, or applications are analyzed. In the summary and outlook, existing challenges, as well as possible paths to solutions for future development are reviewed. We believe that with recent advances in assembly&#8208;based nanofabrication strategies, 3D nanofabrication has achieved tremendous progress in resolution, material generality, and manufacturing cost, for it to make a greater impact in the near future.

&lt;p&gt;Fabrication of complex three-dimensional (3D) structures at nanoscale is the core of nanotechnology, as it enables the creation of various micro-/nano-devices such as micro-robots, metamaterials, sensors, photonic devices, etc. Among most 3D nanofabrication strategies, the guided material assembly, an efficient bottom-up approach capable of directly constructing designed structures from precise integration of material building blocks, possesses compelling advantages in diverse material compatibility, sufficient driving forces, facile processing steps, and nanoscale resolution.

         <title>Topological Spin Textures: Basic Physics and Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 2, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The review offers a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in the realm of topological spin structures in a variety of magnetic materials. It delves into the fundamental magnetic properties of these spin textures, experimental observations in various materials, and their potential applications, highlighting the significant influence these advancements may have on future technological innovations.








Abstract
In the face of escalating modern data storage demands and the constraints of Moore's Law, exploring spintronic solutions, particularly the devices based on magnetic skyrmions, has emerged as a promising frontier in scientific research. Since the first experimental observation of skyrmions, topological spin textures have been extensively studied for their great potential as efficient information carriers in spintronic devices. However, significant challenges have emerged alongside this progress. This review aims to synthesize recent advances in skyrmion research while addressing the major issues encountered in the field. Additionally, current research on promising topological spin structures in addition to skyrmions is summarized. Beyond 2D structures, exploration also extends to 1D magnetic solitons and 3D spin textures. In addition, a diverse array of emerging magnetic materials is introduced, including antiferromagnets and 2D van der Waals magnets, broadening the scope of potential materials hosting topological spin textures. Through a systematic examination of magnetic principles, topological categorization, and the dynamics of spin textures, a comprehensive overview of experimental and theoretical advances in the research of topological magnetism is provided. Finally, both conventional and unconventional applications are summarized based on spin textures proposed thus far. This review provides an outlook on future development in applied spintronics.

         <title>Swarm Autonomy: From Agent Functionalization to Machine Intelligence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 2, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Swarm behaviors observed in nature have inspired the development of synthetic swarms. This review covers key aspects of synthetic swarms, including features of individual agents, external stimuli, swarm behaviors, and applications, examines underlying mechanisms of swarm generation and the emergence of machine intelligence, and envisions the realization of swarm autonomy.








Abstract
Swarm behaviors are common in nature, where individual organisms collaborate via perception, communication, and adaptation. Emulating these dynamics, large groups of active agents can self&#8208;organize through localized interactions, giving rise to complex swarm behaviors, which exhibit potential for applications across various domains. This review presents a comprehensive summary and perspective of synthetic swarms, to bridge the gap between the microscale individual agents and potential applications of synthetic swarms. It is begun by examining active agents, the fundamental units of synthetic swarms, to understand the origins of their motility and functionality in the presence of external stimuli. Then inter&#8208;agent communications and agent&#8208;environment communications that contribute to the swarm generation are summarized. Furthermore, the swarm behaviors reported to date and the emergence of machine intelligence within these behaviors are reviewed. Eventually, the applications enabled by distinct synthetic swarms are summarized. By discussing the emergent machine intelligence in swarm behaviors, insights are offered into the design and deployment of autonomous synthetic swarms for real&#8208;world applications.

         <title>In Vivo Interactions of Nucleic Acid Nanostructures With Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 2, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nucleic acid nanostructures have been intracellular drug carriers for nanomedicine applications for two decades, but their interaction with cells in vivo has gained clarity only recently. This review features their cellular&#8208;level distribution in various organs and the cellular responses induced in rodents, large animals, and humans. It concludes with directions for probing cell&#8208;nanoparticle interactions and regulatory updates for clinical translation.








Abstract

Nucleic acid nanostructures, derived from the assembly of nucleic acid building blocks (e.g., plasmids and oligonucleotides), are important intracellular carriers of therapeutic cargoes widely utilized in preclinical nanomedicine applications, yet their clinical translation remains scarce. In the era of &#8220;translational nucleic acid nanotechnology&#8221;, a deeper mechanistic understanding of the interactions of nucleic acid nanostructures with cells in vivo will guide the development of more efficacious nanomedicines. This review showcases the recent progress in dissecting the in vivo interactions of four key types of nucleic acid nanostructures (i.e., tile&#8208;based, origami, spherical nucleic acid, and nucleic acid nanogel) with cells in rodents over the past five years. Emphasis lies on the cellular&#8208;level distribution of nucleic acid nanostructures in various organs and tissues and the cellular responses induced by their cellular entry. Next, in the spirit of preclinical translation, this review features the latest interactions of nucleic acid nanostructures with cells in large animals and humans. Finally, the review offers directions for studying the interactions of nucleic acid nanostructures with cells from both materials and biology perspectives and concludes with some regulatory updates.

         <title>Embedded Physical Intelligence in Liquid Crystalline Polymer Actuators and Robots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 2, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid crystal polymers have garnered substantial interest in the pursuit of intelligent robots, thanks to their capacity for reversible shape transformation and the vast potential for manifesting physical intelligence. In this review, a focused summary of the stimulation methodologies employed from various perspectives is provided and discusses current research trends in robotics to imbue physical intelligence into LC polymer systems.








Abstract
Responsive materials possess the inherent capacity to autonomously sense and respond to various external stimuli, demonstrating physical intelligence. Among the diverse array of responsive materials, liquid crystalline polymers (LCPs) stand out for their remarkable reversible stimuli&#8208;responsive shape&#8208;morphing properties and their potential for creating soft robots. While numerous reviews have extensively detailed the progress in developing LCP&#8208;based actuators and robots, there exists a need for comprehensive summaries that elucidate the underlying principles governing actuation and how physical intelligence is embedded within these systems. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in developing actuators and robots endowed with physical intelligence using LCPs. This review is structured around the stimulus conditions and categorizes the studies involving responsive LCPs based on the fundamental control and stimulation logic and approach. Specifically, three main categories are examined: systems that respond to changing stimuli, those operating under constant stimuli, and those equip with learning and logic control capabilities. Furthermore, the persisting challenges that need to be addressed are outlined and discuss the future avenues of research in this dynamic field.

         <title>Photonics for Neuromorphic Computing: Fundamentals, Devices, and Opportunities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 2, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review examines advancements in integrated photonic neuromorphic systems, focusing on materials and device engineering breakthroughs needed to advance the field. We analyze various technologies in neuromorphic photonic AI accelerators, evaluating energy efficiency and compute density. Highlighting components like PCSEL lasers and optical interconnects, we discuss recent breakthroughs and recognize obstacles to achieving peta&#8208;level performance. Potential innovations in devices, materials, and integration are explored to overcome these challenges and transform AI and scientific computing in the near future.









Abstract
In the dynamic landscape of Artificial Intelligence (AI), two notable phenomena are becoming predominant: the exponential growth of large AI model sizes and the explosion of massive amount of data. Meanwhile, scientific research such as quantum computing and protein synthesis increasingly demand higher computing capacities. As the Moore's Law approaches its terminus, there is an urgent need for alternative computing paradigms that satisfy this growing computing demand and break through the barrier of the von Neumann model. Neuromorphic computing, inspired by the mechanism and functionality of human brains, uses physical artificial neurons to do computations and is drawing widespread attention. This review studies the expansion of optoelectronic devices on photonic integration platforms that has led to significant growth in photonic computing, where photonic integrated circuits (PICs) have enabled ultrafast artificial neural networks (ANN) with sub&#8208;nanosecond latencies, low heat dissipation, and high parallelism. In particular, various technologies and devices employed in neuromorphic photonic AI accelerators, spanning from traditional optics to PCSEL lasers are examined. Lastly, it is recognized that existing neuromorphic technologies encounter obstacles in meeting the peta&#8208;level computing speed and energy efficiency threshold, and potential approaches in new devices, fabrication, materials, and integration to drive innovation are also explored. As the current challenges and barriers in cost, scalability, footprint, and computing capacity are resolved one&#8208;by&#8208;one, photonic neuromorphic systems are bound to co&#8208;exist with, if not replace, conventional electronic computers and transform the landscape of AI and scientific computing in the foreseeable&#160;future.

         <title>Bioactive Glass in Tissue Regeneration: Unveiling Recent Advances in Regenerative Strategies and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 2, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, various regenerative strategies based on bioactive glass (BG) (e.g. application of BG dissolution products, surface functionalization of BG, loading of biochemical factor/gene in BG particles/nanoparticles, composite polymer&#8208;BG scaffold, and BG&#8208;induced production of extracellular vesicles) targeting different tissues/organs (e.g. muscle, cartilage, skin, oral tissue, gastrointestinal tissue) are introduced.








Abstract
Bioactive glass (BG) is a class of biocompatible, biodegradable, multifunctional inorganic glass materials, which is successfully used for orthopedic and dental applications, with several products already approved for clinical use. Apart from exhibiting osteogenic properties, BG is also known to be angiogenic and antibacterial. Recently, BG's role in immunomodulation has been gradually revealed. While the therapeutic effect of BG is mostly reported in the context of bone and skin&#8208;related regeneration, its application in regenerating other tissues/organs, such as muscle, cartilage, and gastrointestinal tissue, has also been explored recently. The strategies of applying BG have also expanded from powder or cement form to more advanced strategies such as fabrication of composite polymer&#8208;BG scaffold, 3D printing of BG&#8208;loaded scaffold, and BG&#8208;induced extracellular vesicle production. This review presents a concise overview of the recent applications of BG in regenerative medicine. Various regenerative strategies of BG will be first introduced. Next, the applications of BG in regenerating various tissues/organs, such as bone, cartilage, muscle, tendon, skin, and gastrointestinal tissue, will be discussed. Finally, clinical applications of BG for tissue regeneration will be summarized, and future challenges and directions for the clinical translation of BG will be outlined.

         <title>Light&#8208;Responsive Materials in Droplet Manipulation for Biochemical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 2, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;driven droplet manipulation strategies, featured in contactless interaction, high&#8208;spatiotemporal resolution, and biocompatibility, are considered promising, particularly for biochemical applications. Special attention is paid to the underlying mechanisms, recent advancements of light&#8208;responsive materials, and the most notable applications of light&#8208;driven droplet manipulation in this review.








Abstract
Miniaturized droplets, characterized by well&#8208;controlled microenvironments and capability for parallel processing, have significantly advanced the studies on enzymatic evolution, molecular diagnostics, and single&#8208;cell analysis. However, manipulation of small&#8208;sized droplets, including moving, merging, and trapping of the targeted droplets for complex biochemical assays and subsequent analysis, is not trivial and remains technically demanding. Among various techniques, light&#8208;driven methods stand out as a promising candidate for droplet manipulation in a facile and flexible manner, given the features of contactless interaction, high spatiotemporal resolution, and biocompatibility. This review therefore compiles an in&#8208;depth discussion of the governing mechanisms underpinning light&#8208;driven droplet manipulation. Besides, light&#8208;responsive materials, representing the core of light&#8211;matter interaction and the key character converting light into different forms of energy, are particularly assessed in this review. Recent advancements in light&#8208;responsive materials and the most notable applications are comprehensively archived and evaluated. Continuous innovations and rational engineering of light&#8208;responsive materials are expected to propel the development of light&#8208;driven droplet manipulation, equip droplets with enhanced functionality, and broaden the applications of droplets for biochemical studies and routine biochemical investigations.

         <title>Emerging 2D Ferroelectric Devices for In&#8208;Sensor and In&#8208;Memory Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 2, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reviews the recent progress of 2D ferroelectric devices for in&#8208;sensing and in&#8208;memory neuromorphic computing. Experimental and theoretical progresses on 2D ferroelectric devices, including passive ferroelectrics&#8208;integrated 2D devices and active ferroelectrics&#8208;integrated 2D devices are reviewed followed by the integration of perception, memory, and computing application. Notably, the 2D ferroelectric devices have been used to simulate synaptic weights, neuronal model functions, and neural networks for image processing.








Abstract
The quantity of sensor nodes within current computing systems is rapidly increasing in tandem with the sensing data. The presence of a bottleneck in data transmission between the sensors, computing, and memory units obstructs the system's efficiency and speed. To minimize the latency of data transmission between units, novel in&#8208;memory and in&#8208;sensor computing architectures are proposed as alternatives to the conventional von Neumann architecture, aiming for data&#8208;intensive sensing and computing applications. The integration of 2D materials and 2D ferroelectric materials has been expected to build these novel sensing and computing architectures due to the dangling&#8208;bond&#8208;free surface, ultra&#8208;fast polarization flipping, and ultra&#8208;low power consumption of the 2D ferroelectrics. Here, the recent progress of 2D ferroelectric devices for in&#8208;sensing and in&#8208;memory neuromorphic computing is reviewed. Experimental and theoretical progresses on 2D ferroelectric devices, including passive ferroelectrics&#8208;integrated 2D devices and active ferroelectrics&#8208;integrated 2D devices, are reviewed followed by the integration of perception, memory, and computing application. Notably, 2D ferroelectric devices have been used to simulate synaptic weights, neuronal model functions, and neural networks for image processing. As an emerging device configuration, 2D ferroelectric devices have the potential to expand into the sensor&#8208;memory and computing integration application field, leading to new possibilities for modern electronics.

         <title>Musculoskeletal Organs&#8208;on&#8208;Chips: An Emerging Platform for Studying the Nanotechnology&#8211;Biology Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 2, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent advances in musculoskeletal organs&#8208;on&#8208;chips (OoCs) and discusses the integration of nanotechnology in musculoskeletal OoCs for precise control of the nanoscale environment and facilitated functional evaluation. The role of musculoskeletal OoCs&#160;in improving the precision, safety, and efficacy of nanomedicine is then addressed. Finally, the challenges and potential of nanotechnology in OoCs&#160;are envisioned. 








Abstract
Nanotechnology&#8208;based approaches are promising for the treatment of musculoskeletal (MSK) disorders, which present significant clinical burdens and challenges, but their clinical translation requires a deep understanding of the complex interplay between nanotechnology and MSK biology. Organ&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip (OoC) systems have emerged as an innovative and versatile microphysiological platform to replicate the dynamics of tissue microenvironment for studying nanotechnology&#8211;biology interactions. This review first covers recent advances and applications of MSK OoCs and their ability to mimic the biophysical and biochemical stimuli encountered by MSK tissues. Next, by integrating nanotechnology into MSK OoCs, cellular responses and tissue behaviors may be investigated by precisely controlling and manipulating the nanoscale environment. Analysis of MSK disease mechanisms, particularly bone, joint, and muscle tissue degeneration, and drug screening and development of personalized medicine may be greatly facilitated using MSK OoCs. Finally, future challenges and directions are outlined for the field, including advanced sensing technologies, integration of immune&#8208;active components, and enhancement of biomimetic functionality. By highlighting the emerging applications of MSK OoCs, this review aims to advance the understanding of the intricate nanotechnology&#8211;MSK biology interface and its significance in MSK disease management, and the development of innovative and personalized therapeutic and interventional strategies.

         <title>Photothermal CO2 Catalysis toward the Synthesis of Solar Fuel: From Material and Reactor Engineering to Techno&#8208;Economic Analysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 2, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores recent progress in photothermal CO2 conversion, focusing on catalyst design, mechanism analysis, reactor engineering, and techno&#8208;economic aspects. It emphasizes the need to address rising atmospheric CO2 levels by converting CO2 into valuable chemicals using renewable solar energy, offering insights and future research directions in managing the anthropogenic carbon cycle.








Abstract
Carbon dioxide (CO2), a member of greenhouse gases, contributes significantly to maintaining a tolerable environment for all living species. However, with the development of modern society and the utilization of fossil fuels, the concentration of atmospheric CO2 has increased to 400&#160;ppm, resulting in a serious greenhouse effect. Thus, converting CO2 into valuable chemicals is highly desired, especially with renewable solar energy, which shows great potential with the manner of photothermal catalysis. In this review, recent advancements in photothermal CO2 conversion are discussed, including the design of catalysts, analysis of mechanisms, engineering of reactors, and the corresponding techno&#8208;economic analysis. A guideline for future investigation and the anthropogenic carbon cycle are provided.

         <title>Emerging&#8239;Strategies for the Synthesis of Correlated Single Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 2, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the research status and synthetic challenges in correlated single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are showcased. Existing strategies, such as the regulation of nucleation kinetics, nanoscale confinement, defect&#8208;assisted metal trapping, precise control via ligand chemistry, and stepwise deposition, are highlighted. A complementary perspective on emerging methods is provided for high throughput screening and upscaling toward the next&#8208;stage catalyst production.








Abstract
People have been looking for an energy&#8208;efficient and sustainable method to produce future chemicals for decades. Heterogeneous single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with atomic dispersion of robust, well&#8208;characterized active centers are highly desirable. In particular, correlated SACs with cooperative interaction between adjacent single atoms allow the switching of the single&#8208;site pathway to the dual or multisite pathway, thus promoting bimolecular or more complex reactions for the synthesis of fine chemicals. Herein, the structural uniqueness of correlated SACs, including the intermetal distance and electronic interaction in homo/heteronuclear metal sites is featured. Recent advances in the production methods of correlated SACs, showcasing the research status and challenges in traditional methods (such as pyrolysis, wet impregnation, and confined synthesis) for building a comprehensive multimetallic SAC library, are summarized. Emerging strategies such as process automation and continuous&#8208;flow synthesis are highlighted, minimizing the inconsistency in laboratory batch production and allowing high throughput screening and upscaling toward the next&#8208;stage chemical production by correlated SACs.

This review encompasses recent developments of acidic CO2RR, including mechanism elucidation, catalyst design, and device&#8208;level engineering. Challenges and future directions are highlighted to shed light on its further development. 








Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) powered by renewable energy provides a promising route to CO2 conversion and utilization. However, the widely used neutral/alkaline electrolyte consumes a large amount of CO2 to produce (bi)carbonate byproducts, leading to significant challenges at the device level, thereby impeding the further deployment of this reaction. Conducting CO2RR in acidic electrolytes offers a promising solution to address the &#8220;carbonate issue&#8221;; however, it presents inherent difficulties due to the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction, necessitating concerted efforts toward advanced catalyst and electrode designs to achieve high selectivity and activity. This review encompasses recent developments of acidic CO2RR, from mechanism elucidation to catalyst design and device engineering. This review begins by discussing the mechanistic understanding of the reaction pathway, laying the foundation for catalyst design in acidic CO2RR. Subsequently, an in&#8208;depth analysis of recent advancements in acidic CO2RR catalysts is provided, highlighting heterogeneous catalysts, surface immobilized molecular catalysts, and catalyst surface enhancement. Furthermore, the progress made in device&#8208;level applications is summarized, aiming to develop high&#8208;performance acidic CO2RR systems. Finally, the existing challenges and future directions in the design of acidic CO2RR catalysts are outlined, emphasizing the need for improved selectivity, activity, stability, and scalability.

         <title>Achieving Environmentally&#8208;Adaptive and Multifunctional Hydrodynamic Metamaterials through Active Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 2, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An active&#8208;mode hydrodynamic metamaterial is developed with flow&#8208;dipoles, enabling active control of the flow field with various functionalities. By adjusting the flow&#8208;dipole moment, invisibility, flow shielding, and flow enhancing are achieved. Furthermore, it is environmentally adaptive and maintains proper functions in different environments. Thus, this design can significantly enhance tunability and adaptability of hydrodynamic metamaterials in complex and ever&#8208;changing environments. 








Abstract
As hydrodynamic metamaterials continue to develop, the inherent limitations of passive&#8208;mode metamaterials become increasingly apparent. First, passive devices are typically designed for specific environments and lack the adaptability to environmental changes. Second, their unique functions often rely on intricate structures, or challenging material properties, or a combination of both. These limitations considerably hinder the potential applications of hydrodynamic metamaterials. In this study, an active&#8208;mode hydrodynamic metamaterial is theoretically proposed and experimentally demonstrated by incorporating source&#8208;and&#8208;sink flow&#8208;dipoles into the system, enabling active manipulation of the flow field with various functionalities. By adjusting the magnitude and direction of the flow&#8208;dipole moment, this device can easily achieve invisibility, flow shielding, and flow enhancing. Furthermore, it is environmentally adaptive and can maintain proper functions in different environments. It is anticipated that this design will significantly enhance tunability and adaptability of hydrodynamic metamaterials in complex and ever&#8208;changing&#160;environments.

         <title>Zero&#8208;Waste Polyanion and Prussian Blue Composites toward Practical Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel mechanochemical approach enables closed&#8208;loop transformation of raw materials into high&#8208;value sodium&#8208;ion battery (SIBs) cathode materials. This &#8220;zero&#8208;waste&#8221;,&#160;solvent&#8208;free process minimizes water use, maximizes material utilization, and simplifies production. The composite, combining Prussian blue analogs and sulfates, demonstrates excellent wide&#8208;temperature electrochemical performance, with synergy verified by in situ characterizations and density functional theory calculations, highlighting its potential for cost&#8208;effective, practical SIBs.








Abstract
Closed&#8208;loop transformation of raw materials into high&#8208;value&#8208;added products is highly desired for the sustainable development of the society but is seldom achieved. Here, a low&#8208;cost, solvent&#8208;free and &#8220;zero&#8208;waste&#8221; mechanochemical protocol is reported for the large&#8208;scale preparation of cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). This process ensures full utilization of raw materials, effectively reduces water consumption, and simplifies the operating process. Benefiting from the synergistic effect between the cubic Prussian blue analogs (c&#8208;NFFHCF) and dehydrated polyanionic sulfates (m&#8208;NFS), the generated composite exhibits promising wide&#8208;temperature electrochemical performance and excellent practical application potential. The synergistic effect between m&#8208;NFS and c&#8208;NFFHCF in the composite is revealed through multiple in situ characterizations and density functional theory calculations. The proposed mechanochemical strategy can be scaled to a kilogram&#8208;grade level, providing a sustainable method for the value&#8208;added utilization of the by&#8208;products during Prussian blue analogs synthesis, advancing the design of &#8220;zero&#8208;waste&#8221; cathode materials for low&#8208;cost practical SIBs.

         <title>Flat&#8208;Band Electronic Bipolarity in a Janus and Kagome van der Waals Semiconductor Nb3TeI7</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Janus and Kagome van der Waals material Nb3TeI7 exhibits strong electronic bipolar states and robust semiconducting properties with the face&#8208;dependent n&#8208;type and p&#8208;type field&#8208;effect transistor behaviors. Strong built&#8208;in out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization is attributed to ferroelectric&#8208;like stacking, amplified by strong electron correlation in the Nb flat bands at the breathing&#8208;Kagome lattice, endowing Nb3TeI7 with a promising material platform for Janus&#8208;material&#8208;based applications.








Abstract
Janus materials, a novel class of materials with two faces of different chemical compositions and electronic polarities, offer significant potential for various applications with catalytic reactions, chemical sensing, and optical or electronic responses. A key aspect for such functionalities is face&#8208;dependent electronic bipolarity, which is usually limited by the chemical distinction of terminated surfaces and has not been exploited in the semiconducting regime. Here, it is showed that a Janus and Kagome van der Waals (vdW) material Nb3TeI7 has ferroelectric&#8208;like coherent stacking of the Janus layers and hosts strong electronic bipolar states in the semiconducting regime. A large potential difference of &#8764; 0.7&#160;eV between the I4 and TeI3 terminated surfaces is observed, despite only one fourth of the I atoms being replaced by Te atoms on one side of the layers. Additionally, robust semiconducting properties with the face&#8208;dependent n&#8208;type and p&#8208;type field&#8208;effect transistor behaviors are demonstrated. These unique properties are attributed to Nb 4d orbital flat bands of the breathing&#8208;Kagome lattice, of which significantly large electron mass makes the semiconducting properties immune to impurity doping, and inherent strong electron correlation enhances asymmetric electron distribution, thereby amplifying a built&#8208;in electric field. These findings highlight that naturally&#8208;grown Janus and Kagome vdW semiconductors provide a promising material platform for utilizing strong electronic bipolarity in 2D&#8208;material&#8208;based&#160;applications.

Utilizing electrostatic forces and dielectric pinning, it achieves controlled, contamination&#8208;free manipulation of nanoscale droplets. The study explores its application in diverse fields, including microfluidics, chemical reactions, and material fabrication, offering a sustainable and highly accurate platform for droplet&#8208;based technologies.








Abstract
The application of physical fields is crucial for droplet generation and manipulation, underpinning technologies like printing, microfluidic biochips, drug delivery, and flexible sensors. Despite advancements, precise micro/nanoscale droplet generation and accurate microfluidic reactions remain challenging. Inspired by the liquid ejection mechanisms in microscopic organisms, an electrostatic manipulator for the precise capture, emission, and transport of microdroplets is proposed. This approach enables the controlled and periodic emission of nanoscale daughter droplets from microscale parent droplets, achieved through dielectric pinning on surfaces and electrostatic field&#8208;driven forces. Results show precise nanoscale droplet release on inert polymer surfaces, enabling directional, contamination&#8208;free liquid manipulation. Moreover, leveraging surface treatment techniques and robust electrostatic force&#8208;driven transportation, a versatile strategy for droplet generation and manipulation, spanning from microfluidic devices to chemical reaction operations. The novel droplet manipulation phenomena and control strategies can advance the fields of electrostatic&#8208;based microfluidics, materials fabrication, and beyond.

         <title>A Bioinspired Virus&#8208;Like Mechano&#8211;Bactericidal Nanomotor for Ocular Multidrug&#8208;Resistant Bacterial Infection Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomimetic mechano&#8211;bactericidal nanomotor designed to address ocular multidrug&#8208;resistant bacterial infections by combining spiky topological structures with self&#8208;thermophoresis is developed. The nanomotor demonstrates highly specific targeting of bacteria, effective elimination of bacterial cells, enhanced penetration into biofilms, and excellent biocompatibility. In vivo studies indicate that the mechano&#8211;bactericidal approach delivers outstanding therapeutic results; while, causing minimal side effects.








Abstract
Multidrug&#8208;resistant (MDR) bacteria and their associated biofilms are major causative factors in eye infections, often resulting in blindness and presenting considerable global health challenges. Presently, mechano&#8211;bactericidal systems, which combine distinct topological geometries with mechanical forces to physically induce bacterial apoptosis, show promising potential. However, the physical interaction process between current mechano&#8211;bactericidal systems and bacteria is generally based on passive diffusion or Brownian motion and lacks the force required for biofilm penetration; thus, featuring low antibacterial efficacy. Here, a biomimetic mechano&#8211;bactericidal nanomotor (VMSNT) is synthesized by functionalizing COOH&#8208;PEG&#8208;phenylboronic acid (PBA) on virus&#8208;like mesoporous silica, with subsequent partial coating of Au caps. Enhanced by self&#8208;thermophoresis capabilities and virus&#8208;like topological shapes, VMSNT significantly improves mechanical antibacterial effects and biofilm penetration. In addition, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM)&#160;analyses demonstrate that VMSNT can precisely target bacteria within the infection microenvironment, facilitated by PBA's ability to recognize and bind to the peptidoglycan on bacterial surfaces. Remarkably, VMSNT is also effective in eliminating MDR bacteria and reducing inflammation in mice models of methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)&#8208;infected keratitis and endophthalmitis, with minimal adverse effects. Overall, such a nanomotor presents a promising approach for addressing the challenges of ocular MDR bacterial infections.

         <title>The Photoinduced Response of Antimony from Femtoseconds to Minutes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The optical properties of antimony make it a promising candidate for photonic memory applications due to the large contrast between crystalline and amorphous solid states. This study resolves the entire switching cycle from crystal to glass and back. It elucidates the structural origin of the optical properties of the final and intermediate transient states, which are relevant for high bandwidth photonic applications.








Abstract
As a phase change material (PCM), antimony exhibits a set of desirable properties that make it an interesting candidate for photonic memory applications. These include a large optical contrast between crystalline and amorphous solid states over a wide wavelength range. Switching between the states is possible on nanosecond timescales by applying short heating pulses. The glass state is reached through melting and rapid quenching through a supercooled liquid regime. While initial and final states are easily characterized, little is known about the optical properties on the path to forming a glass. Here we resolve the entire switching cycle of antimony with femtosecond resolution in stroboscopic optical pump&#8208;probe measurements and combine the experimental results with ab&#8208;initio molecular dynamics simulations. The glass formation process of antimony is revealed to be a complex multi&#8208;step process, where the intermediate transient states exhibit distinct optical properties with even larger contrasts than those observed between crystal and glass. The provided quantitative understanding forms the basis for exploitation in high bandwidth photonic&#160;applications.

         <title>Efficient and Scalable Direct Regeneration of Spent Layered Cathode Materials via Advanced Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel advanced oxidation strategy leverages the inherent catalytic activity of spent layered cathode materials, facilitating the decomposition of H2O2 to generate &#8226;OH and &#8226;O2&#8722; free radicals, which promote oxidation reactions with the surface of the spent cathode. It effectively elevates the Ni valence state, modifies the surface microstructure, and eliminates fluorine&#8208;containing interface impurities, thereby promoting the solid&#8208;state regeneration process.








Abstract
Among direct recycling methods for spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries, solid&#8208;state regeneration is the route with minimal bottlenecks for industrial application and is highly compatible with the current industrial cathode materials production processes. However, surface structure degradation and interfacial impurities of spent cathodes significantly hinder Li+ replenishment during restoration. Herein, we propose a unique advanced oxidation strategy that leverages the inherent catalytic activity of spent layered cathode materials to address these challenges. This strategy decomposes H2O2 to generate &#8226;OH and &#8226;O2&#8722; free radicals, facilitating oxidation reactions with the surface of the spent cathode. As a result, this approach effectively elevates the Ni valence state, modifies the surface microstructure, and eliminates fluorine&#8208;containing interface impurities, thereby promoting the solid&#8208;state regeneration process. The regenerated LiNi0.83Co0.12Mn0.05O2 cathodes demonstrate a specific capacity of 206&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.1 C, comparable to commercially available cathodes. Meanwhile, this advanced oxidation strategy proves adaptable and scalable for treating industrial dismantled LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 black mass. A 3.1&#160;Ah pouch cell assembled with the regenerated LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 exhibits impressive capacity retention of 74% after 500 cycles. Additionally, a techno&#8208;economic analysis reveals that this strategy possesses low energy consumption, minimal environmental footprint, and high economic viability, suggesting its suitability for the battery recycling industry.

         <title>&#954;/&#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 Type&#8208;II Phase Heterojunction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Researchers have experimentally unveiled a perfect interface between the monoclinic (&#946;)&#8208;phase and orthorhombic (&#954;)&#8208;phase of Ga2O3, establishing a &#8220;phase heterojunction&#8221; within the ultrawide bandgap Ga2O3 material system. This phase heterojunction exhibits a type&#8208;II band alignment with significant band offset, highlighting a large interfacial electrical field, which is verified through the separation of photogenerated electron&#8211;hole pairs, even without external bias.








Abstract
Ultrawide&#8208;bandgap gallium oxide (Ga2O3) holds immense potential for crucial applications such as solar&#8208;blind photonics and high&#8208;power electronics. Although several Ga2O3 polymorphs, i.e., &#945;, &#946;, &#947;, &#948;, &#949;, and &#954; phases, have been identified, the band alignments between these phases have been largely overlooked due to epitaxy challenges and inadvertent neglect. Despite having similar stoichiometry, heterojunctions involving different phases may exhibit band offsets. Here, &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3/&#954;&#8208;Ga2O3&#8208;stacked &#8220;phase heterojunction&#8221; is demonstrated experimentally. This phase heterojunction has a sharp and well&#8208;defined interface, and subsequent measurements reveal an unbeknown type&#8208;II band alignment with significant valence/conduction band offsets of &#8776;0.65&#160;eV/0.71&#160;eV. This alignment is promising for self&#8208;powered deep ultraviolet (DUV) signal detection, necessitating an internal electric field near the junction and matching the absorption properties for effective electron&#8211;hole separation. The fabricated phase heterojunction photodetector displays a responsivity of three orders of magnitude higher at 17.8&#160;mA W&#8722;1, with improved response times (rise time &#8776;0.21 s, decay time &#8776;0.53 s) under DUV illumination and without external bias in comparison to the bare &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 and &#954;&#8208;Ga2O3 photodetectors, confirming the strong interfacial electrical field. This study provides profound insight into Ga2O3/Ga2O3 heterojunction interfaces with different polymorphs, allowing the use of phase heterojunctions to advance electronic device applications.

Here, &#946;-Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/&#954;-Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-stacked &#8220;phase heterojunction&#8221; is demonstrated experimentally. This phase heterojunction has a sharp and well-defined interface, and subsequent measurements reveal an unbeknown type-II band alignment with significant valence/conduction band offsets of &#8776;0.65&#160;eV/0.71&#160;eV. This alignment is promising for self-powered deep ultraviolet (DUV) signal detection, necessitating an internal electric field near the junction and matching the absorption properties for effective electron&#8211;hole separation. The fabricated phase heterojunction photodetector displays a responsivity of three orders of magnitude higher at 17.8&#160;mA W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, with improved response times (rise time &#8776;0.21 s, decay time &#8776;0.53 s) under DUV illumination and without external bias in comparison to the bare &#946;-Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and &#954;-Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; photodetectors, confirming the strong interfacial electrical field. This study provides profound insight into Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; heterojunction interfaces with different polymorphs, allowing the use of phase heterojunctions to advance electronic device applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of Surface Ligands Enables Versatile Optical Patterning and Form Factor Flexibility in Quantum Dot Assemblies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Partially ligand&#8208;exchanged InP QDs with lipoic acid can undergo direct optical patterning when exposed to UV light, which induces disulfide ring opening, leading to polymerization and the assembly of the QDs. This approach also allows for the creation of stretchable QD films that can be recycled through reversible polymerization. This study provides a solution for future advanced displays and optoelectronics.








Abstract
The evolution of display technologies is rapidly transitioning from traditional screens to advanced augmented reality (AR)/virtual reality (VR) and wearable devices, where quantum dots (QDs) serve as crucial pure&#8208;color emitters. While solution processing efficiently forms QD solids, challenges emerge in subsequent stages, such as layer deposition, etching, and solvent immersion. These issues become especially pronounced when developing diverse form factors, necessitating innovative patterning methods that are both reversible and sustainable. Herein, a novel approach utilizing lipoic acid (LA) as a ligand is presented, featuring a carboxylic acid group for QD surface attachment and a reversible disulfide ring structure. Upon i&#8208;line UV exposure, the LA ligand initiates ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP), crosslinking the QDs and enhances their solvent resistance. This method enables precise full&#8208;color QD patterns with feature sizes as small as 3&#160;&#181;m and pixel densities exceeding 3788 ppi. Additionally, it supports the fabrication of stretchable QD composites using LA&#8208;derived monomers. The reversible ROP process allows for flexibility, self&#8208;healing, and QD recovery, promoting sustainability and expanding QD applications for ultra&#8208;fine patterning and on&#8208;silicon displays.

         <dc:description>
Transition metal ions migration is the fundamental science for layered oxides of Li&#8208;ion and Na&#8208;ion batteries and demands more efforts in this direction. In this review, the Ni, Co, Mn, Fe, Cr, and V ions migration in layered oxides, covering the key thermodynamic and kinetic factors, universal and specific migration characteristics, effects on the electrochemical performance, optimization strategies, and characterization techniques, are comprehensively summarized.








Abstract
Li&#8208;ion and Na&#8208;ion batteries are promising systems for powering electric vehicles and grid storage. Layered 3d transition metal oxides AxTMO2 (A = Li, Na; TM = 3d transition metals; 0&#160;&lt;&#160;x&#160;&#8804;&#160;2) have drawn extensive attention as cathode materials due to their exceptional energy densities. However, they suffer from several technical challenges caused by crystal structure degradation associated with TM ions migration, such as poor cycling stability, inferior rate capability, significant voltage hysteresis, and serious voltage decay. Aiming to tackle these challenges, this review provides an in&#8208;depth discussion and comprehensive understanding of the TM ions migration behaviors in AxTMO2. First, the key thermodynamics and kinetics that impact TM ions migration are discussed, covering ionic radius, electronic configuration, crystal structure arrangement, and migration energy barrier. In particular, details are provided regarding the universal and specific migration characteristics of Ni, Co, Mn, Fe, Cr, and V ions in layered cathode materials. Subsequently, the impacts of these migrations on electrochemical performance are emphasized in terms of the fundamental science behind technical issues, and strategies to modulate TM ions migration for advanced cathode materials development are summarized. Besides, characterization techniques for probing the TM ions migration are present, like neutron diffraction (ND), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and others. Finally, future directions in this regard are comprehensively concluded. This review offers valuable insights into the basic design of advanced layered oxide cathode materials for Li&#8208;ion and Na&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>3D&#8208;Porous Electrocatalyst with Tip&#8208;Enhanced Electric Field Effect Enables High&#8208;Performance Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolyzer</title>

         <dc:description>
An efficiently reactant&#8208;enriched and mass traffic system is developed through integrating high&#8208;curvature Pt nanocones with a 3D porous TiAl framework. The 3D multiple interconnected channels in TiAl boosts the mass transport rate, while the high curvature of Pt nanocones induces an ultrahigh local electric field, thereby accelerating the transfer of H3O+ during HER.








Abstract
Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), as one of the most advanced methods for the green production of hydrogen, is greatly impeded by inefficient mass transfer. Here we present an efficiently reactant enriched and mass traffic system by integrating high&#8208;curvature Pt nanocones with 3D porous TiAl framework to enhance mass transfer rate. Theoretical simulations, in situ Raman spectroscopy and potential&#8208;dependent Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy results disclose that the strong local electric field induced by high&#8208;curvature Pt can greatly promote the H3O+ supply rate during HER, resulting in &#8764;1.6 times higher H3O+ concentration around the Pt nanocone than that in electrolyte. X&#8208;ray computed tomography and molecular dynamic simulation demonstrate the diffusion coefficient of H3O+ in 3D TiAl framework surpasses that in commercial carbon support by more than 16.7 times. Consequently, Pt/TiAl&#8208;nanocone exhibits a high mass activity of 17.2 mA cm&#8722;2Pt at an overpotential of 100 mV with an ultrahigh TOF value of 42.9 atom&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. In a proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer, the Pt/TiAl&#8208;nanocone cathode achieves an industrial&#8208;scale current density of 1.0 A cm&#8722;2 with a cell voltage of 1.88 V at 60 &#176;C and can operate stably for at least 800 h with a sluggish voltage decay rate of 137 &#181;V h&#8722;1.

         <title>Permeable and Durable Liquid&#8208;Metal Fiber Mat as Implantable Physiological Electrodes with Long&#8208;Term Biocompatibility</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The LM implantable physiological electrode (LM&#8208;Ag&#8208;pSBS) is designed based on a spatial wettability tuning strategy. The wettability issue of LMs within the three&#8208;dimensional porous skeletons of the substrate is addressed by the synergistic interaction between Ag and LMs. Due to its long&#8208;term biocompatibility and durability, the LM&#8208;Ag&#8208;pSBS shows great potential in smart healthcare, brain&#8208;computer interface, and disability rehabilitation.








Abstract
Implantable physiological electrodes provide unprecedented opportunities for real&#8208;time and uninterrupted monitoring of biological signals. Most implantable electronics adopt thin&#8208;film substrates with low permeability that severely hampers tissue metabolism, impeding their long&#8208;term biocompatibility. Recent innovations have seen the advent of permeable electronics through the strategic modification of liquid metals (LMs) onto porous substrates. However, the durability of these electronics is limited by the inherent poor wettability of LMs, particularly within the intricate 3D skeleton of the porous substrate. Herein, the study reports a spatial wettability tuning strategy that solves the wettability issue of LMs within the porous substrates, enabling the LM physiological electrodes with high durability and long&#8208;term biocompatibility. The study demonstrates the use of the electrodes as implantable neural interface to realize in vivo acquisition of electrocardiograph and electrocorticogram signals with long&#8208;term biocompatibility and high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio. This work demonstrates a promising direction for rational design of durable implantable bioelectronics with long&#8208;term biocompatibility.

         <title>Multiple Electron Transfers Enable High&#8208;Capacity Cathode Through Stable Anionic Redox</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
K2FeSiO4 is synthesized and utilized as a cathode material for potassium&#8208;ion batteries. This compound offers advantages including high elemental abundance, low cost, and structural stability. Ultrahigh capacity can be achieved through charge compensation involving Fe cations and O anions during cycling. Additionally, the strong Si&#9472;O bond can effectively immobilize O anions to prevent excessive lattice oxygen loss.








Abstract
Single&#8208;electron transfer, low alkali metal contents, and large&#8208;molecular masses limit the capacity of cathodes. This study uses a cost&#8208;effective and light&#8208;molecular&#8208;mass orthosilicate material, K2FeSiO4, with a high initial potassium content, as a cathode for potassium&#8208;ion batteries to enable the transfer of more than one electron. Despite the limited valence change of Fe ions during cycling, K2FeSiO4 can undergo multiple electron transfers via successive oxygen anionic redox reactions to generate a high reversible capacity. Although the formation of O&#8210;O dimers in K2FeSiO4 occur upon removing large amounts of potassium, the strong binding effect of Si on O mitigates irreversible oxygen release and voltage degradation during cycling. K2FeSiO4 achieves 236 mAh g&#8722;1 at 50&#160;mA g&#8722;1, with an energy density of 520&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, which can be comparable with commercial LiFePO4 materials. Moreover, it also exhibits 1400 stable cycles under high&#8208;current conditions. These findings enhance the potential commercialization prospects for potassium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Intrinsically Thermoplastic Semiconducting Polymer with Excellent Strain&#8208;Tolerance Capacity for Flexible Ultra&#8208;Deep&#8208;Blue Polymer Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;efficiency intrinsically thermoplastic semiconducting polymer is demonstrated via internal plasticization. The thermoplastic films not only exhibit outstanding ultra&#8208;deep&#8208;blue emission with an extremely high efficiency of &#8776;90% and CIE of (0.16, 0.04), but also show an outstanding energy dissipation capacity under the stress effect. Flexible polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs) present excellent deformation stability with stable, efficient, and uniform ultra&#8208;deep&#8208;blue electroluminescent property.








Abstract
Complex internal stresses that appear in flexible thin&#8208;film electronic devices under long&#8208;term deformation operation are associated with incompatible mechanical properties of the multiple layers, which potentially cause intralayer fracture and separation. These defects may result in device instability, performance loss, and failure. Herein, a thermoplastic functional strategy is proposed for manufacturing high&#8208;performance stretchable semiconducting polymers with excellent strain&#8208;tolerance capacities for flexible electronic devices. Internal plasticization is used to obtain a thermoplastic light&#8208;emitting polymer (N2) that can suppress intralayer tensile fracture and compressive separation to enhance the deformation stability of flexible thin&#8208;film optoelectronic devices, enabling outstanding energy dissipation capacity under stress. The thermoplastic films exhibit stable and efficient ultra&#8208;deep&#8208;blue emission with a high efficiency of &#8776;90% and chromaticity coordinates of (0.16, 0.04). Moreover, the N2&#8208;based rigid and flexible polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs) exhibit stable ultra&#8208;deep&#8208;blue electroluminescence properties with high EQEs of &#8776;2.4% and 1.9%, respectively. Compared with devices based on brittle PODPF, flexible PLEDs based on thermoplastic films effectively suppress performance degradation after hundreds of cycles of bending fatigue, even under extremely rigid conditions. Introducing intrinsically thermoplastic semiconducting polymers in flexible electronic devices can thus substantially enhance their operational stability under deformation.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A data&#8208;driven design strategy is developed for UC therapeutic nanozymes. The optimal CT&#8208;imageable oral UC therapeutic nanozyme SrDy2O4 is successfully discovered and the high&#8208;dimensional structure&#8208;activity relationships between the material database and nanozyme UC therapeutics are further elucidated by machine learning model interpretation in combination with the SISSO method.









Abstract
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic gastrointestinal inflammatory disorder with rising prevalence. Due to the recurrent and difficult&#8208;to&#8208;treat nature of UC symptoms, current pharmacological treatments fail to meet patients' expectations. This study presents a machine learning&#8208;assisted high&#8208;throughput screening strategy to expedite the discovery of efficient nanozymes for UC treatment. Therapeutic requirements, including antioxidant property, acid stability, and zeta potential, are quantified and predicted by using a machine learning model. Non&#8208;quantifiable attributes, including intestinal barrier repair efficacy and biosafety, are assessed via high&#8208;throughput screening. Feature significance analysis, sure independence screening, and sparsifying operator symbolic regression reveal the high&#8208;dimensional structure&#8208;activity relationships between material features and therapeutic needs. SrDy2O4 with high stability, low toxicity, targeting ability, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging capability is identified, which reduces ROS production, lowers cytochrome C levels in cytoplasm, and inhibits apoptosis in intestinal epithelial cells by stabilizing the mitochondrial membrane potential. Mice treated with SrDy2O4 show improvements in colon length and body weight compared with dextran sodium sulfate salt&#8208;treated model group. Transcriptomic and 16S rRNA sequencing analyses show that SrDy2O4 boosts beneficial gut bacteria, and decreases pathogenic bacteria, thereby effectively restoring gut microbiota balance. Moreover, SrDy2O4 offers the advantage of X&#8208;ray imaging without side effects.

         <title>An Analysis of Components and Enhancement Strategies for Advancing Memristive Neural Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review addresses the limitations of von Neumann architectures and highlights advancements in memristor&#8208;based neural networks (Mem&#8208;NNs). It categorizes Mem&#8208;NNs into preprocessing units, processing units, and learning algorithms, and discusses optimization strategies across materials, devices, circuits, and algorithms. Furthermore, it compares recent neuromorphic hardware with conventional systems, and outlines current challenges and future directions for enhancing Mem&#8208;NN functionality and reliability.








Abstract
Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and big data have highlighted the limitations of traditional von Neumann architectures, such as excessive power consumption and limited performance improvement with increasing parameter numbers. These challenges are significant for edge devices requiring higher energy and area efficiency. Recently, many reports on memristor&#8208;based neural networks (Mem&#8208;NN) using resistive switching memory have shown efficient computing performance with a low power requirement. Even further performance optimization can be made using engineering resistive switching mechanisms. Nevertheless, systematic reviews that address the circuit&#8208;to&#8208;material aspects of Mem&#8208;NNs, including their dedicated algorithms, remain limited. This review first categorizes the memristor&#8208;based neural networks into three components: pre&#8208;processing units, processing units, and learning algorithms. Then, the optimization methods to improve integration and operational reliability are discussed across materials, devices, circuits, and algorithms for each component. Furthermore, the review compares recent advancements in chip&#8208;level neuromorphic hardware with conventional systems, including graphic processing units. The ongoing challenges and future directions in the field are discussed, highlighting the research to enhance the functionality and reliability of Mem&#8208;NNs.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and big data have highlighted the limitations of traditional von Neumann architectures, such as excessive power consumption and limited performance improvement with increasing parameter numbers. These challenges are significant for edge devices requiring higher energy and area efficiency. Recently, many reports on memristor-based neural networks (Mem-NN) using resistive switching memory have shown efficient computing performance with a low power requirement. Even further performance optimization can be made using engineering resistive switching mechanisms. Nevertheless, systematic reviews that address the circuit-to-material aspects of Mem-NNs, including their dedicated algorithms, remain limited. This review first categorizes the memristor-based neural networks into three components: pre-processing units, processing units, and learning algorithms. Then, the optimization methods to improve integration and operational reliability are discussed across materials, devices, circuits, and algorithms for each component. Furthermore, the review compares recent advancements in chip-level neuromorphic hardware with conventional systems, including graphic processing units. The ongoing challenges and future directions in the field are discussed, highlighting the research to enhance the functionality and reliability of Mem-NNs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Boosting Amino Acid Synthesis with WOx Sub&#8208;Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By adjusting the size of tungsten oxide cluster through carbon defects, sub&#8208;nanoclusters are applied to electrocatalytic C&#9472;N coupling for amino acid synthesis. Unlike nanoclusters, sub&#8208;nanoclusters facilitate potential tuning to optimize hydroxylamine yield, enabling the production of diverse amino acids with &#945;&#8208;keto acids. This study offers an innovative perspective for catalyst design in high&#8208;value electrosynthesis.








Abstract
The conversion of nitrate&#8208;rich wastewater and biomass&#8208;derived blocks into high&#8208;value products using renewably generated electricity is a promising approach to modulate the artificial carbon and nitrogen cycle. Here, a new synthetic strategy of WOx sub&#8208;nanoclusters is reported and supported on carbon materials as novel efficient electrocatalysts for nitrate reduction and its coupling with &#945;&#8208;keto acids. In acidic solutions, the NH3&#8208;NH2OH selectivity can also optimized by adjusting the potential, with the total FE exceeding 80% over a wide potential range. After introducing &#945;&#8208;keto acids, the WOx/D&#8208;CB electrode achieves remarkable activity and selectivity toward C2&#8208;C6 amino acids. For glycine and alanine, impressive FEs of 49.34% and 38.22% based on transitional metal oxides can be obtained, surpassing those of WOx nanoclusters with larger size. In situ analysis and mechanistic studies reveal the critical role of WOx sub&#8208;nanoclusters in reducing the energy barriers of key steps in alanine synthesis. This work opens up new insights into the rational design of cluster catalysts to promote electrochemical amino acid synthesis.

         <title>Self&#8208;Adaptive Dielectrics with Tunable Nonlinear Electrical Conductivity via Virus&#8208;Like Structures Composed of Metal Particles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;adaptive dielectrics (SADs) are future materials for advanced electronic device insulation due to their rapid charge dissipation in distorted electric fields. Current SADs barely achieve tunable nonlinear electrical properties due to the inherent nature of semiconductor filler interfaces. Virus&#8208;like structures are proposed with subminiature metal particles and semiconductor microspheres to overcome this problem, thereby enhancing the rapid charge dissipation capability and flexibility of SADs.








Abstract
Self&#8208;adaptive dielectrics (SADs), with the characteristics of rapid charge dissipation in electric field distortion, is regarded as the future material for package insulation of advanced electronic devices. The current landscape of SADs is incapable to achieve tunable nonlinear electrical conductivity and threshold field strength due to the inherent Schottky barrier, significantly limiting the application scenarios of SADs. Here, a strategy is reported to construct a stepped Schottky barrier through virus&#8208;like structures, which are composed of subminiature metal particles and semiconductor microspheres. It is found that the metal particles can serve as the capture center to attract the free charge in the matrix, precisely instructing the charge transfer pathway. The barriers between metal particles and semiconductor filler, flexibly controlled by the composition of metal particles, endow with extra source of nonlinear conductivity. Under the optimal composition and size of metal particles, SADs exhibit prominent nonlinear electrical conductivity and reliable adaptive charge release characteristics under pulsed electric field. The work pioneers a breakthrough by overcoming the constraint that SADs are previously limited to the inherent Schottky barrier of semiconductor materials and enabling the unprecedented controllability and flexibility of nonlinear electrical characteristics by metal particles, contributing a distinctive perspective to the development of SADs.

         <title>Phytochlorin&#8208;Based Sonosensitizers Combined with Free&#8208;Field Ultrasound for Immune&#8208;Sonodynamic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dedicated sonodynamic system with controllable and reproducible conditions provided by free&#8208;field ultrasound is developed for activating phytochlorin&#8208;based sonosensitizers. Combined with a detailed step&#8208;by&#8208;step sonodynamic process, this work acts as a powerful guide for applying the sonodynamic technique, facilitating sonodynamic research from laboratory to clinical application.








Abstract
Phytochlorins, a class of plant&#8208;derived tetrapyrroles, show great potential as sonosensitizers in sonodynamic therapy (SDT). The development of new phytochlorin&#8208;based sonosensitizers has significantly improved SDT, yet the absence of specialized sonodynamic systems limits their clinical translation. Herein, a dedicated ultrasound system along with a detailed step&#8208;by&#8208;step sonodynamic process from in vitro to in vivo is developed to activate phytochlorin&#8208;based sonosensitizers. Compared to standing&#8208;wave ultrasound, free&#8208;field ultrasound maintains stable acoustic pressure amplitudes and minimizes mechanical damage to cell membranes. In vitro experiments demonstrate that free&#8208;field ultrasound effectively activates naturally occurring phytochlorin, reducing the cavitation threshold for reactive oxygen species production and triggering immunogenic cell death. Furthermore, the intravenously injectable phytochlorin&#8208;based sonosensitizer (C34) enhances sonodynamic efficiency by reducing interfacial tension. Driven by in vivo free&#8208;field ultrasound, C34 effectively inhibits tumor growth in an orthotopic murine breast cancer model and elicits an immune response, preventing tumor metastasis. The reliable protocol provided by the free&#8208;field ultrasound system facilitates the activation of phytochlorin&#8208;based sonosensitizers while simultaneously stimulating the immune system, highlighting the potential of immune&#8208;sonodynamic therapy.

         <title>Advanced Polymeric Nanoparticles for Cancer Immunotherapy: Materials Engineering, Immunotherapeutic Mechanism and Clinical Translation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here recent advances in engineered polymeric nano&#8208;paradigms that are uniquely suited to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of cancer immunotherapy while decreasing the immune response associated toxicity are discussed and highlighted. The viewpoint on this emerging field lying at the interface of polymeric chemistry/material science and cancer immunology for accelerating clinical translation is provided.








Abstract
Cancer immunotherapy, which leverages immune system components to treat malignancies, has emerged as a cornerstone of contemporary therapeutic strategies. Yet, critical concerns about the efficacy and safety of cancer immunotherapies remain formidable. Nanotechnology, especially polymeric nanoparticles (PNPs), offers unparalleled flexibility in manipulation&#8208;from the chemical composition and physical properties to the precision control of nanoassemblies. PNPs provide an optimal platform to amplify the potency and minimize systematic toxicity in a broad spectrum of immunotherapeutic modalities. In this comprehensive review, the basics of polymer chemistry, and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art designs of PNPs from a physicochemical standpoint for cancer immunotherapy, encompassing therapeutic cancer vaccines, in situ vaccination, adoptive T&#8208;cell therapies, tumor&#8208;infiltrating immune cell&#8208;targeted therapies, therapeutic antibodies, and cytokine therapies are delineated. Each immunotherapy necessitates distinctively tailored design strategies in polymeric nanoplatforms. The extensive applications of PNPs, and investigation of their mechanisms of action for enhanced efficacy are particularly focused on. The safety profiles of PNPs and clinical research progress are discussed. Additionally, forthcoming developments and emergent trends of polymeric nano&#8208;immunotherapeutics poised to transform cancer treatment paradigms into clinics are explored.

         <title>Longitudinal and Noninvasive Intracellular Recordings of Spontaneous Electrophysiological Activity in Rat Primary Neurons on Planar MEA Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An approach is presented to noninvasively porate neurons on planar MEA electrodes and enable the recording of intracellular&#8208;like action potentials without interfering with the spontaneous activity of the network not affecting the neuronal health. In particular, it is shown that the method works on commercial MEA electrodes integrated on both high density and high&#8208;throughput MEAs.








Abstract
Presently, the in vitro recording of intracellular neuronal signals on microelectrode arrays (MEAs) requires complex 3D nanostructures or invasive and approaches such as electroporation. Here, it is shown that laser poration enables intracellular coupling on planar electrodes without damaging neurons or altering their spontaneous electrophysiological activity, allowing the process to be repeated multiple times on the same cells. This capability distinguishes laser&#8208;based neuron poration from more invasive methods like electroporation, which typically serve as endpoint measurement for cells. It is demonstrated that planar MEA electrodes, when combined with laser cell optoporation and live cell staining, can record spontaneous intracellular signaling from primary neurons in vitro. This approach allows for the detection of attenuated signals resembling positive monophasic intracellular action potentials. Recordings after laser optoporation also reveal subthreshold signals such as post&#8208;synaptic potentials that are essential for assessing neuronal network plasticity and connectivity.

     alt="Longitudinal and Noninvasive Intracellular Recordings of Spontaneous Electrophysiological Activity in Rat Primary Neurons on Planar MEA Electrodes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An approach is presented to noninvasively porate neurons on planar MEA electrodes and enable the recording of intracellular-like action potentials without interfering with the spontaneous activity of the network not affecting the neuronal health. In particular, it is shown that the method works on commercial MEA electrodes integrated on both high density and high-throughput MEAs.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presently, the in vitro recording of intracellular neuronal signals on microelectrode arrays (MEAs) requires complex 3D nanostructures or invasive and approaches such as electroporation. Here, it is shown that laser poration enables intracellular coupling on planar electrodes without damaging neurons or altering their spontaneous electrophysiological activity, allowing the process to be repeated multiple times on the same cells. This capability distinguishes laser-based neuron poration from more invasive methods like electroporation, which typically serve as endpoint measurement for cells. It is demonstrated that planar MEA electrodes, when combined with laser cell optoporation and live cell staining, can record spontaneous intracellular signaling from primary neurons in vitro. This approach allows for the detection of attenuated signals resembling positive monophasic intracellular action potentials. Recordings after laser optoporation also reveal subthreshold signals such as post-synaptic potentials that are essential for assessing neuronal network plasticity and connectivity. Moreover, the noninvasiveness of the process enables repeated intracellular recordings over multiple days from the same cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bioinspired Smart Triboelectric Soft Pneumatic Actuator&#8208;Enabled Hand Rehabilitation Robot</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative, lobster tail&#8208;inspired triboelectric soft pneumatic actuator (TENG&#8208;SPA) is introduced, featuring self&#8208;powered sensing capabilities. Leveraging these features, a smart TENG&#8208;SPA&#8208;enabled hand rehabilitation robot is developed, showing great promise in replacing the traditional assessment method&#8212;which relies on clinicians for manual stretching, subjective resistance evaluation, and experience&#8208;based scoring&#8212;thereby driving the transformation from traditional rehabilitation medicine to modern digital rehabilitation medicine.









Abstract
Quantitative assessment for post&#8208;stroke spasticity remains a significant challenge due to the encountered variable resistance during passive stretching, which can lead to the widely used modified Ashworth scale (MAS) for spasticity assessment depending heavily on rehabilitation physicians. To address these challenges, a high&#8208;force&#8208;output triboelectric soft pneumatic actuator&#160;(TENG&#8208;SPA) inspired by a lobster tail is developed. The bioinspired TENG&#8208;SPA can generate approximately 20 N at 0.1&#160;MPa, providing sufficient stretching force for spastic fingers. The anti&#8208;interference, durability, and electrical output characteristics of the TENG&#8208;SPA under varying conditions&#8212;such as different air pressures, bending frequencies, and simulated spastic finger stretching&#8212;are explored, demonstrating TENG&#8208;SPA's ability to sense resistance during the stretching process. Furthermore, a TENG&#8208;SPA&#8208;enabled hand rehabilitation robot system integrated with the convolutional neural network (CNN) is further developed, which is tested in a clinical trial involving 15 stroke patients. The results have demonstrated that a classification accuracy for the levels of finger spasticity reaches 93.3% and the MAS scores predicted by the CNN regression model exhibit a strong linear relationship with the actual MAS (R2 = 0.8451, p &lt;&#160;0.01). This study presents promising potential applications in digital rehabilitation medicine, human&#8211;machine interaction, biomedicine, and related fields.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework Nanoscintillators for X&#8208;Ray&#8208;Induced Photodynamic Therapy in Hepatocellular Carcinoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel highly biocompatible organic phosphorescent HOF nanoscintillators (BPT&#8208;HOF@PEG) is designed and engineered to enhance X&#8208;PDT for unresectable HCC treatment. Precise tumor localization capability of SRT and effective X&#8208;ray energy absorbing and transferring capability of BPT&#8208;HOF@PEG endowing BPT&#8208;HOF@PEG&#8208;mediated X&#8208;PDT approach with significant HCC therapeutic potential. Therefore, phosphorescent HOF&#8208;based X&#8208;PDT is an ideal alternative therapy for patients with unresectable HCC.








Abstract
X&#8208;ray induced photodynamic therapy (X&#8208;PDT) leverages penetrating X&#8208;ray to generate singlet oxygen (1O2) for treating deep&#8208;seated tumors. However, conventional X&#8208;PDT typically relies on heavy metal inorganic scintillators and organic photosensitizers to produce 1O2, which presents challenges related to toxicity and energy conversion efficiency. In this study, highly biocompatible organic phosphorescent nanoscintillators based on hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOF) are designed and engineered, termed BPT&#8208;HOF@PEG, to enhance X&#8208;PDT in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment. BPT&#8208;HOF@PEG functions simultaneously as both scintillator and photosensitizer, effectively absorbing and transferring X&#8208;ray energy to generate abundant 1O2. Both in vitro and in vivo investigations demonstrate that internalized BPT&#8208;HOF@PEG efficiently produces significant quantities of 1O2 upon X&#8208;ray irradiation. Additionally, X&#8208;ray exposure directly inflicts DNA damage, and the synergistic effects of these mechanisms result in pronounced cell death and substantial tumor growth inhibition, with a significant inhibition rate of up to 90.4% in vivo assessments. RNA sequencing analyses reveal that X&#8208;PDT induces apoptosis in Hepa1&#8208;6 cells while inhibiting cell proliferation, culminating in tumor cell death. Therefore, this work highlights the considerable potential of efficient phosphorescent HOF nanoscintillators&#8208;based X&#8208;PDT as a promising therapeutic approach for HCC, providing a highly effective alternative with negligible toxicity for patients with unresectable tumors.

         <title>Additives&#8208;Modified Electrodeposition for Synthesis of Hydrophobic Cu/Cu2O with Ag Single Atoms to Drive CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ag single atoms deposited hydrophobic Cu/Cu2O heterostructure (AgSA&#8208;Cu/Cu2O) is designed and synthesized via modified one&#8208;step electrodeposition. In situ Raman spectra and DFT calculations reveal that Ag single atoms delay the reduction of Cu2O and promote the electron transfer. AgSA&#8208;Cu/Cu2O helps promoting *CO to *COH, exhibiting a FEC2+ of 86.1% and 90.2% for CO2 electroreduction in H&#8208;type cell and flow cell, respectively.








Abstract
Copper&#8208;based electrocatalysts are recognized as crucial catalysts for CO2 electroreduction into multi&#8208;carbon products. However, achieving copper&#8208;based electrocatalysts with adjustable valences via one&#8208;step facile synthesis remains a challenge. In this study, Cu/Cu2O heterostructure is constructed by adjusting the anion species of the Cu ions&#8208;containing electrolyte during electrodeposition synthesis. Then, Cu/Cu2O with tuned nanoarchitectures ranging from dendrites to polyhedrons is achieved by introducing transition metal ions as additives, leading to an adjustable interfacial microenvironment for CO2/H2O adsorption on the Cu/Cu2O electrodes. Additionally, the polyhedral Cu/Cu2O catalysts are used as templates for depositing Ag single atoms (AgSA), which are known as synergistic active sites for promoting *CO to *COH toward C2+ products. The prepared AgSA&#8208;Cu/Cu2O catalyst is evaluated in a flow cell and exhibited a FEC2+ of 90.2% and a partial current density (jc2+) of 426.6&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for CO2 electroreduction. As revealed by in situ Raman spectra and density functional theory calculations, the introduction of Ag single atoms slows down the reduction of Cu+ during CO2 electroreduction, especially at a high current density. This work provides a promising paradigm for diverse control of the compositions and hydrophobicity of Cu&#8208;based catalysts for selective CO2 electroreduction to C2+ products.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crystallization mechanism of the biomimetic calcification method triggers a secondary conformational transition of proteins from &#945;&#8208;helix to &#946;&#8208;sheet in solvents. The adoption of the &#946;&#8208;sheet conformation enhances the affinity for metal ions, thereby intensifying the competitive interaction with organic ligands and expediting crystal formation and encapsulation.








Abstract
Biomimetic calcification is a micro&#8208;crystallization process that mimics the natural biomineralization process, where biomacromolecules regulate the formation of inorganic minerals. In this study, it is presented that a protein&#8208;assisted biomimetic calcification method for the in situ synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;doped metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) materials. A series of unique core&#8208;shell structures are created by utilizing proteins as templates and guiding agents in the nucleation step, creating ideal conditions for shell growth. To further understand the influence of the protein and organic ligand on the morphology of the MOF shell, the competing mechanism toward metal ions is supposed. Through systematic experiments and analyses, a strategy to construct unique precursor structures by controlling calcification nucleation is proposed. After carbonization, protein&#8208;containing precursors exhibit exceptional porous characteristics, stability, and high nitrogen content. These attributes make them promising materials as sulfur hosts in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSB). Electrochemical tests confirm that biomimetic calcification&#8208;assisted 3D carbonaceous structure can effectively immobilize dissolved polysulfides, demonstrating strong adsorption and catalytic capabilities. This discovery not only opens up new avenues for employing biomimetic calcification as a sustainable method for batteries but also enlightens the fields of materials science, catalytic chemistry, and energy storage.

In this study, it is presented that a protein-assisted biomimetic calcification method for the in situ synthesis of nitrogen-doped metal-organic framework (MOF) materials. A series of unique core-shell structures are created by utilizing proteins as templates and guiding agents in the nucleation step, creating ideal conditions for shell growth. To further understand the influence of the protein and organic ligand on the morphology of the MOF shell, the competing mechanism toward metal ions is supposed. Through systematic experiments and analyses, a strategy to construct unique precursor structures by controlling calcification nucleation is proposed. After carbonization, protein-containing precursors exhibit exceptional porous characteristics, stability, and high nitrogen content. These attributes make them promising materials as sulfur hosts in lithium-sulfur batteries (LSB). Electrochemical tests confirm that biomimetic calcification-assisted 3D carbonaceous structure can effectively immobilize dissolved polysulfides, demonstrating strong adsorption and catalytic capabilities. This discovery not only opens up new avenues for employing biomimetic calcification as a sustainable method for batteries but also enlightens the fields of materials science, catalytic chemistry, and energy storage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrically Switchable Multi&#8208;Stable Topological States Enabled by Surface&#8208;Induced Frustration in Nematic Liquid Crystal Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a liquid crystal (LC) cell with well&#8208;designed surface anchoring patterns, electrical switching between multi&#8208;stable states with distinct optical properties is obtained. Dual&#8208;frequency LC with frequency dependent dielectric properties is used to realize repeatable switching between different topological states with and without disclination lines. Metastability without the need for an applied voltage is demonstrated.








Abstract
In liquid crystal (LC) cells, the surface patterning directs the self&#8208;assembly of the uniaxial building blocks in the bulk, enabling the design of stimuli&#8208;response optical devices with various functionalities. The combination of different anchoring patterns at both substrates can lead to surface induced frustration, preventing a purely planar and defect&#8208;free configuration. In cells with crossed assembly of rotating anchoring patterns, elastic deformations allow to obtain a defect&#8208;free bulk configuration, but an electrical stimulus can induce disclination lines. The disclination network is preserved without applied voltage. Depending on the electric field treatment and geometrical parameters, different multi&#8208;stable states with and without disclinations are obtained. This is demonstrated with the help of dual&#8208;frequency LCs, for which the frequency dependent dielectric properties allow repeatable switching between multi&#8208;stable states. Topological protection and the associated energy barrier between different states explains the observed metastability. The obtained configurations are retrieved with Q&#8208;tensor simulations and the validity is confirmed by matching optical simulations with experimentally obtained microscopy images. The realized multi&#8208;stable topological states interact differently with light, resulting in distinct optical properties. Optimization allows to switch between a highly transparent state and an opaque state, opening up opportunities for smart windows with low energy consumption.

         <title>Self&#8208;Sustained Biophotocatalytic Nano&#8208;Organelle Reactors with Programmable DNA Switches for Combating Tumor Metastasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To overcome the challenges of limited light penetration and insufficient oxygen supply in PDT for metastatic tumor treatment, a self&#8208;contained organelle&#8208;mimicking nanoreactor is engineered with DNA switches using cell&#8208;inspired compartmentalization technology. It utilizes endogenous glucose as a biofuel, luminol as a light source, and hemoglobin as an oxygen supplier to achieve self&#8208;illuminating chemiexcited PDT via chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer.








Abstract
Metastasis, the leading cause of mortality in cancer patients, presents challenges for conventional photodynamic therapy (PDT) due to its reliance on localized light and oxygen application to tumors. To overcome these limitations, a self&#8208;sustained organelle&#8208;mimicking nanoreactor is developed here with programmable DNA switches that enables bio&#8208;chem&#8208;photocatalytic cascade&#8208;driven starvation&#8208;photodynamic synergistic therapy against tumor metastasis. Emulating the compartmentalization and positional assembly strategies found in living cells, this nano&#8208;organelle reactor allows quantitative co&#8208;compartmentalization of multiple functional modules for the designed self&#8208;illuminating chemiexcited PDT system. Within the space&#8208;confined nanoreactor, biofuel glucose is converted to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) which enhances luminol&#8208;based chemiluminescence (CL), consequently driving the generation of photochemical singlet oxygen (1O2) via chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer. Meanwhile, hemoglobin functions as a synchronized oxygen supplier for both glucose oxidation and PDT, while also exhibiting peroxidase&#8208;like activity to produce hydroxyl radicals (&#183;OH). Crucially, the nanoreactor keeps switching off in normal tissues, with on&#8208;demand activation in tumors through toehold&#8208;mediated strand displacement. These findings demonstrate that this nanoreactor, which is self&#8208;sufficient in light and oxygen and precise in striking tumors, presents a promising paradigm for managing highly metastatic cancers.

         <title>Distinct Transmission of Left&#8208; and Right&#8208;Handed Magnon Modes in Compensated Ferrimagnet/Antiferromagnet Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Left&#8208; and right&#8208;handed magnons, thermally generated in a compensated ferrimagnet Gd3Fe5O12, propagate efficiently through the antiferromagnetic NiO layer. Within NiO, these magnons undergo distinct decay processes, unveiling a chiral selection rule for magnon transmission induced by interfacial spin&#8208;flop coupling. These findings provide new insights for advancing chirality&#8208;based magnonics.








Abstract
The chirality of magnons, exhibiting left&#8208; and right&#8208;handed polarizations analogous to the counterparts of spin&#8208;up and spin&#8208;down, has emerged as a promising paradigm for information processing. However, the potential of this paradigm is constrained by the controllable excitation and transmission of chiral magnons. Here, the magnon transmission is explored in the Gd3Fe5O12/NiO/Pt structures. It is demonstrated that both left&#8208; and right&#8208;handed magnon modes, thermally generated in the compensated ferrimagnet Gd3Fe5O12, can efficiently propagate through the antiferromagnetic NiO layer. Remarkably, these modes undergo distinct decay processes in NiO, manifested by different evolutions of the spin diffusion length with temperature. This behavior can be explained by an exchange model rooted in the spin&#8208;flop magnetic configuration between Gd3Fe5O12 and NiO, which establishes a chiral selection rule for magnon transmission. These findings offer significant fundamental insight into controlling chiral magnons, opening avenues for chirality&#8208;based magnonics.

         <title>Multiscale Understanding of Anion Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells: Mechanisms, Electrocatalysts, Polymers, and Cell Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) are a promising sustainable electrochemical technology with potential applications in aircraft, submarines, vehicles, etc. This review aims to provide an overview of recent advances in AEMFCs by examining four key aspects: reaction mechanisms, electrochemical catalysts, anion exchange polymers, and fuel cell management, covering from microscale to macroscale.








Abstract
Anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) are among the most promising sustainable electrochemical technologies to help solve energy challenges. Compared to proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), AEMFCs offer a broader choice of catalyst materials and a less corrosive operating environment for the bipolar plates and the membrane. This can lead to potentially lower costs and longer operational life than PEMFCs. These significant advantages have made AEMFCs highly competitive in the future fuel cell market, particularly after advancements in developing non&#8208;platinum&#8208;group&#8208;metal anode electrocatalysts, anion exchange membranes and ionomers, and in understanding the relationships between cell operating conditions and mass transport in AEMFCs. This review aims to compile recent literature to provide a comprehensive understanding of AEMFCs in three key areas: i) the mechanisms of the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline media; ii) recent advancements in the synthesis routes and structure&#8208;property relationships of cutting&#8208;edge HOR and ORR electrocatalysts, as well as anion exchange membranes and ionomers; and iii) fuel cell operating conditions, including water management and impact of CO2. Finally, based on these aspects, the future development and perspectives of AEMFCs are proposed.

         <title>A Wenzel Interfaces Design for Homogeneous Solute Distribution Obtains Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Wenzel model is successfully constructed at the interface to achieve a super&#8208;hydrophilic substrate, greatly alleviating the coffee&#8208;ring effect during the large&#8208;area perovskite film printing process. The highly hydrophilic nature of the interface, along with its unique microstructure, greatly facilitates the efficient and rapid deposition of perovskite colloidal particles during the printing process.








Abstract
The coffee&#8208;ring effect, caused by uneven deposition of colloidal particles in perovskite precursor solutions, leads to poor uniformity in perovskite films prepared through large&#8208;area printing. In this work, the surface of SnO2 is roughened to construct a Wenzel model, successfully achieving a super&#8208;hydrophilic interface. This modification significantly accelerates the spreading of the perovskite precursor solution, reducing the response delay time of perovskite colloidal particles during the printing process. Additionally, the micro&#8208;spherical depression structure on the SnO2 surface effectively inhibits the migration of colloidal particles toward the edges of liquid film, trapping perovskite colloidal particles at the buried interfaces and improving film uniformity. Due to the synergistic effect of super&#8208;hydrophilicity and micro&#8208;rough structure on the surface of SnO2, leading to a substantial improvement in the quality of perovskite crystals. Therefore, the efficiency of printing prepared flexible devices (0.101 cm2) reached 25.42% (certified 25.12%). Moreover, the efficiency of rigid and flexible large&#8208;scale perovskite solar modules (PSMs) based on meniscus&#8208;coating manufacture reached 21.34% and 16.99% (100 cm2), respectively, and demonstrated superior environmental stability by maintaining an initial efficiency of 91% after being stored in atmospheric conditions for 2000 h, offering practical guidance for fabricating high&#8208;performance and stable large&#8208;scale perovskite solar cells (PSCs).

&lt;p&gt;A Wenzel model is successfully constructed at the interface to achieve a super-hydrophilic substrate, greatly alleviating the coffee-ring effect during the large-area perovskite film printing process. The highly hydrophilic nature of the interface, along with its unique microstructure, greatly facilitates the efficient and rapid deposition of perovskite colloidal particles during the printing process.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coffee-ring effect, caused by uneven deposition of colloidal particles in perovskite precursor solutions, leads to poor uniformity in perovskite films prepared through large-area printing. In this work, the surface of SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is roughened to construct a Wenzel model, successfully achieving a super-hydrophilic interface. This modification significantly accelerates the spreading of the perovskite precursor solution, reducing the response delay time of perovskite colloidal particles during the printing process. Additionally, the micro-spherical depression structure on the SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; surface effectively inhibits the migration of colloidal particles toward the edges of liquid film, trapping perovskite colloidal particles at the buried interfaces and improving film uniformity. Due to the synergistic effect of super-hydrophilicity and micro-rough structure on the surface of SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, leading to a substantial improvement in the quality of perovskite crystals. Therefore, the efficiency of printing prepared flexible devices (0.101 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) reached 25.42% (certified 25.12%). Moreover, the efficiency of rigid and flexible large-scale perovskite solar modules (PSMs) based on meniscus-coating manufacture reached 21.34% and 16.99% (100 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), respectively, and demonstrated superior environmental stability by maintaining an initial efficiency of 91% after being stored in atmospheric conditions for 2000 h, offering practical guidance for fabricating high-performance and stable large-scale perovskite solar cells (PSCs).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Role of Long&#8208;Range Interactions Between High&#8208;Entropy Single&#8208;Atoms in Catalyzing Sulfur Conversion Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unveiling the mechanism of high&#8208;entropy single&#8208;atom catalysts (HESAC), this study reveals how long&#8208;range interactions and entropy govern electron states, enhancing electrocatalysis for lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries with a superior rate capacity of 3.4 mAh cm&#8722;2 at 10 C.








Abstract
Sulfur conversion reactions are the foundation of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries but usually possess sluggish kinetics during practical battery operation. Herein, a high&#8208;entropy single&#8208;atom&#160;catalyst (HESAC) is synthesized for this process. In contrast to conventional dual&#8208;atom catalysts that form metal&#8211;metal bonds, the center metal atoms in HESAC are not bonded but exhibit long&#8208;range interactions at a sub&#8208;nanometer distance (&lt;9 &#197;). The synergistic effect between the long&#8208;range interactions and entropy changes enables the regulation of d&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;electron states. This alteration in the electronic structure improves the adsorption and electronic conductivity of intermediate polysulfides, thereby accelerating their conversion kinetics. Consequently, this leads to a significant enhancement in specific capacities by &#8776;40% at high rates compared to single&#8208;atom catalysts. The resulting lithium&#8211;sulfur battery with HESAC demonstrates a remarkable areal capacity of 3.4 mAh cm&#8722;2 at 10 C. These findings provide valuable insights into the design principle of metal atom catalysts for electrochemical reactions.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Approaches to Engineer Fluorescent Nanosensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanomaterial&#8208;based optical sensors are powerful tools to identify and image (biological) molecules. Optimizing surface chemistry and photophysics of these sensors is essential, but current methods limit throughput. This article discusses bottlenecks and highlights opportunities and requirements for high throughput and the scalability of non&#8208;classical recognition strategies.








Abstract
Optical sensors are powerful tools to identify and image (biological) molecules. Because of their optoelectronic properties, nanomaterials are often used as building blocks. To transduce the chemical interaction with the analyte into an optical signal, the interplay between surface chemistry and nanomaterial photophysics has to be optimized. Understanding these aspects promises major opportunities for tailored sensors with optimal performance. However, this requires methods to create and explore the many chemical permutations. Indeed, many current approaches are limited in throughput. This affects the chemical design space that can be studied, the application of machine learning approaches as well as fundamental mechanistic understanding. Here, an overview of selection&#8208;limited and synthesis&#8208;limited approaches is provided to create and identify molecular nanosensors. Bottlenecks are discussed and opportunities of non&#8208;classical recognition strategies are highlighted such as corona phase molecular recognition as well as the requirements for high throughput and scalability. Fluorescent carbon nanotubes are powerful building blocks for sensors and their huge chemical design space makes them an ideal platform for high throughput approaches. Therefore, they are the focus of this article, but the insights are transferable to any nanosensor system. Overall, this perspective aims to provide a fresh perspective to overcome current challenges in the nanosensor field.

         <title>RAFT Polymerization for Advanced Morphological Control: From Individual Polymer Chains to Bulk Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization is a transformative technique in polymer science, offering unprecedented control over polymer morphology across a vast range of length scales. Recent advances leverage RAFT's precision and versatility to enable advanced materials design by dictating monomer sequences at the molecular level, manipulating self&#8208;assembly to make mesoscale structures, and controlling micro&#8208;phase separation for intricate 3D printed structures.








Abstract
Control of the morphology of polymer systems is achieved through reversible&#8208;deactivation radical polymerization techniques such as Reversible Addition&#8208;Fragmentation chain Transfer (RAFT). Advanced RAFT techniques offer much more than just &#8220;living&#8221; polymerization &#8212; the RAFT toolkit now enables morphological control of polymer systems across many decades of length&#8208;scale. Morphological control is explored at the molecular&#8208;level in the context of syntheses where individual monomer unit insertion provides sequence&#8208;defined polymers (single unit monomer insertion, SUMI). By being able to define polymer architectures, the synthesis of bespoke shapes and sizes of nanostructures becomes possible by leveraging self&#8208;assembly (polymerization induced self&#8208;assembly, PISA). Finally, it is seen that macroscopic materials can be produced with nanoscale detail, based on phase&#8208;separated nanostructures (polymerization induced microphase separation, PIMS) and microscale detail based on 3D&#8208;printing technologies. RAFT control of morphology is seen to cross from molecular level to additive manufacturing length&#8208;scales, with complete morphological control over all length&#8208;scales.

         <title>A Single&#8208;Pixel Event Photoactive Device for Real&#8208;Time, In&#8208;Sensor Spatiotemporal Optical Information Processing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research introduces a single&#8208;pixel event photoactive device with selective carrier integration that merges spatiotemporal event sensing and built&#8208;in short&#8208;term memory. It processes multibit parallel data and recognizes patterns ultrafast (0.4&#160;&#181;s) with ultralow energy use (25 femtojoules). Adjusting its speed allows trajectory and position detection of events through optical flow sensing.








Abstract
The increasing demand for energy&#8208;efficient, sophisticated optical sensing technologies in various applications, from machine vision to optical communication, highlights the necessity for innovations in spatiotemporal information sensing and processing at a nearly single&#8208;pixel scale. Traditional methods, including multi&#8208;pixel photodetector arrays and event&#8208;based camera systems, often fail to provide rapid, real&#8208;time detection and processing of dynamic events within the sensor. This shortcoming is particularly notable in handling high&#8208;dimensional spatiotemporal data, where the dependency on sequential data input and external processing tools leads to latency, reduced throughput, and heightened energy consumption, thereby impeding real&#8208;time parallel data processing capabilities. Here, a carrier&#8208;selective, single&#8208;pixel, position&#8208;sensitive planar photoactive device that integrates spatiotemporal event sensing with inherent short&#8208;term memory capabilities is introduced. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept single&#8208;pixel event photoactive device enables in&#8208;sensor spatiotemporal parallel optical information processing, efficiently managing multibit (&gt;4 bit) data simultaneously and facilitating ultrafast (&#8776;0.4&#160;&#181;s) recognition of input patterns with low energy consumption (25 femtojoules). Additionally, by adjusting the operating speed from continuous to pulsed light illumination, the sensor array can detect trajectories and absolute position of events, offering in&#8208;sensor optical flow detection. This single&#8208;pixel event photodetector marks significant advancement toward developing compact, energy&#8208;efficient, ultrafast sensors suitable for a wide range of in sensor&#8208;based photonic applications.

         <title>Enhancing Resistance to Wetting Transition through the Concave Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the pulvilli of the leaf beetle (Gastrophysa atrocyanea), a new design strategy is introduced to enhance the wetting stability of superhydrophobic surfaces through the implementation of concave structures. The air caps forming on the concavity contribute to preventing the Cassie&#8208;Baxter to Wenzel transition under continuous exposure to various impacts and hydrostatic pressures.








Abstract
Water&#8208;repellent superhydrophobic surfaces are ubiquitous in nature. The fundamental understanding of bio/bio&#8208;inspired structures facilitates practical applications surmounting metastable superhydrophobicity. Typically, the hierarchical structure and/or reentrant morphology have been employed hitherto to suppress the Cassie&#8208;Baxter to Wenzel transition (CWT). Herein, a new design concept is reported, an effect of concave structure, which is vital for the stable superhydrophobic surface. The thermodynamic and kinetic stabilities of the concave pillars are evaluated by continuous exposure to various hydrostatic pressures and sudden impacts of water droplets with various Weber numbers (We), comparing them to the standard superhydrophobic normal pillars. Specifically, the concave pillar exhibits reinforced impact resistance preventing CWT below a critical We of &#8776;27.6, which is &#8776;1.6 times higher than that of the normal pillar (&#8776;17.0). Subsequently, the stability of underwater air film (plastron) is investigated at various hydrostatic pressures. The results show that convex air caps formed at the concave cavities generate downward Laplace pressure opposing the exerted hydrostatic pressure between the pillars, thus impeding the hydrostatic pressure&#8208;dependent underwater air diffusion. Hence, the effects of trapped air caps contributing to the stable Cassie&#8208;Baxter state can offer a pioneering strategy for the exploration and utilization of superhydrophobic surfaces.

         <title>Anisotropic Ferroelectricity in Polar Vortices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, the existence and anisotropic nature of macroscopic polarization components that emerge within lattices of nanoscale polar vortices are demonstrated. In particular, the component parallel to the vortex axis shows novel switching behavior that can be harnessed for multistate memory, with excellent stability of numerous intermediate states demonstrated.








Abstract
The exotic polarization configurations of topologically protected dipolar textures have opened new avenues for realizing novel phenomena absent in traditional ferroelectric systems. While multiple recent studies have revealed a diverse array of emergent properties in such polar topologies, the details of their atomic and mesoscale structures remain incomplete. Through atomic&#8208; and meso&#8208;scale imaging techniques, the emergence of a macroscopic ferroelectric polarization along both principal axes of the vortex lattice while performing phase&#8208;field modeling to probe the atomic scale origins of these distinct polarization components is demonstrated. Additionally, due to the anisotropic epitaxial strain, the polarization switching behavior perpendicular and parallel to the vortices is highly anisotropic, with switching along the vortex axes occurring over numerous decades in field&#8208;pulse width. This slow switching process allows for the deterministic control of the polarization state, enabling a non&#8208;volatile, multi&#8208;state memory with excellent distinguishability and long retention&#160;times.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Rapid Elimination of Antibiotic Resistance Contaminations Using Graphitic Carbon Nitride Tailored with Carrier Confinement Domains</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carrier confinement domains alter the inherent sp2 hybridized plane structure of graphitic carbon nitride, further inducing stronger electron delocalization and long&#8208;range order, which promotes faster separation and migration of photogenerated carrier, accelerates redox reaction decoupling and photodynamic antibiotic resistance removal.








Abstract
Solar water disinfection facilitated by photocatalyst has been considered a viable point&#8208;of&#8208;use (POU) method for mitigating antibiotic resistance contaminations at the household or community levels. Here, density functional theory calculations are used to guide the fabrication of a carrier confinement domains (CCD)&#8208;decorated graphitic carbon nitride (CN) photocatalyst. The CCD integration effectively disrupts the electron distribution symmetry of CN, amplifies its local electron density, and facilitates the formation of a long&#8208;range ordered structure, thereby enhancing charge separation efficiency. Importantly, the CCD directs the migration of photogenerated carriers to specific regions upon light illumination, effectively minimizing their spatial proximity. As a result, the overall reactive oxygen species level of the photocatalytic system is markedly elevated, with a twelvefold increase in H2O2 concentration, alongside a significant rise in &#8226;O2&#8722; and &#8226;OH steady&#8208;state concentrations. Remarkably, a record&#8208;high disinfection efficiency is attained, successfully inactivating 7 log of antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria within 30&#160;min. Additionally, the photocatalyst can be integrated into a continuous&#8208;flow fixed&#8208;bed reactor, facilitating clean water production for up to 60&#160;h at a rate of 121&#160;L&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;day&#8722;1, highlighting its significant potential for POU applications.

         <title>Breaking Mass Transport Limit for Hydrogen Evolution&#8208;Inhibited and Dendrite&#8208;Free Aqueous Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mass transport limit is circumvented by the pulsed charging protocols, achieving (002)&#8208;textured, dendrite&#8208;free, and hydrogen&#8208;evolution&#8208;free Zn plating/stripping at ultrahigh current density up to 160 mA cm&#8722;2. The Zn batteries accordingly achieve high current density (50&#8211;100 mA cm&#8722;2), high areal mass loading (29 mgcathode cm&#8722;2), and high areal capacity (7.9 mAh cm&#8722;2).








Abstract
It is commonly accepted that batteries perform better at low current densities below the mass&#8208;transport limit, which restricts their current rate and capacity. Here, it is demonstrated that the performance of Zn metal electrodes can be dramatically enhanced at current densities and cut&#8208;off capacities exceeding the mass&#8208;transport limit by using pulsed&#8208;current protocols. These protocols achieve cumulative plating/stripping capacities of 11.0 Ah cm&#8722;2 and 3.8 Ah cm&#8722;2 at record&#8208;high current densities of 80 and 160 mA cm&#8722;2, respectively. The study identifies and understands the promoted (002)&#8208;textured Zn growth and suppressed hydrogen evolution based on the thermodynamics and kinetics of competing reactions. Furthermore, the over&#8208;limiting pulsed&#8208;current protocol enables long&#8208;life Zn batteries with high mass loading (29 mgcathode cm&#8722;2) and high areal capacity (7.9 mAh cm&#8722;2), outperforming cells using constant&#8208;current protocols at equivalent energy and time costs. The work provides a comprehensive understanding of the current&#8208;capacity&#8208;performance relationship in Zn plating/stripping and offers an effective strategy for dendrite&#8208;free metal batteries that meet practical requirements for high capacity and high current rates.

         <title>Strong Anisotropy and Giant Photothermoelectricity of 1D Alloy Nb3Se12I&#8208;Based Photodetector for Ultrabroadband Light&#8208;Detection and Encryption Imaging Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multifunctional Nb3Se12I photodetector integrated broadband imaging and encrypted communications are realized based on the photothermoelectric effect and polarization sensitivity. The photothermoelectric and photoconductive effect synergistic detection mechanism enable high responsivity and rapid operation across a broad wavelength spectrum from deep&#8208;ultraviolet to terahertz. The encrypted method of polarization state compensation for photothermoelectric current converting image data into polarization states enhances information security. This work provides an effective strategy to advance anisotropic thermoelectric materials for high&#8208;capacity, secure communication applications.








Abstract
Securing high&#8208;capacity and safe communication holds great potential for ushering in the new era of digital society. In this study, a wide&#8208;band photodetector based on the quasi&#8208;1D niobium selenide compounds (Nb3Se12I), showing up photothermoelectric (PTE) dominated multiple synergistic effects with high responsivity across a wide wavelength range from deep&#8208;ultraviolet (254&#160;nm) to terahertz (0.30 THz), providing an efficient strategy for high&#8208;capacity optical processing is introduced. Combined with the polarized&#8208;sensitive property of the Nb3Se12I photodetector, an encrypted imaging technology using polarization&#8208;resolved PTE current is developed. This technology is capable of transforming encrypted messages into polarization states, which can be restored through a specially designed decryption algorithm, greatly enhancing the concealment and security of the information transmission process. Overall, the Nb3Se12I&#8208;based detector manifests in terms of high responsivity (283.2 A W&#8722;1 to 520&#160;nm, 1632.4 A W&#8722;1 to 980&#160;nm, and 1868.1 A W&#8722;1 for short&#8208;wave infrared light of 2200&#160;nm), suitable response speed of 43 &#181;s for 0.30 THz wave and polarization anisotropy ratio of 1.83. The versatile abilities of photodetector in the realm of ultrabroadband polarized detection and encryption imaging may advance the use of anisotropic thermoelectric materials in high&#8208;capacity and secure information communication applications.

&lt;p&gt;The multifunctional Nb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;I photodetector integrated broadband imaging and encrypted communications are realized based on the photothermoelectric effect and polarization sensitivity.

         <title>Multifunctional Ultrathin Ti3C2Tx MXene@CuCo2O4 /PE Separator for Ultra&#8208;High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density and Large&#8208;Capacity Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Pouch Cells</title>

This study presents a multifunctional ultrathin Ti3C2Tx MXene/CuCo2O4/PE separator that can suppress LiPSs shuttling, enhance sulfur redox kinetics, and regulate Li+ deposition, and consequently achieve an outstanding energy density of 417&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 in a 10Ah&#8208;level pouch cell.








Abstract
The shuttling of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), sluggish reaction kinetics, and uncontrolled lithium deposition/stripping remain the main challenges in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs), which are aggravated under practical working conditions, i.e., high sulfur loading and lean electrolyte in large&#8208;capacity pouch cells. This study introduces a Ti3C2Tx MXene@CuCo2O4 (MCC) composite on a polyethylene (PE) separator to construct an ultrathin MXene@CuCo2O4/PE (MCCP) film. The MCCP functional separator can deliver superior LiPSs adsorption/catalysis capabilities via the MCC composite and regulate the Li+ deposition through a conductive Ti3C2Tx MXene framework, enhancing redox kinetics and cycling lifetime. When paired with sulfur/carbon (S/C) cathode and lithium metal anode, the resultant 10 Ah&#8208;level pouch cell with the ultrathin MCCP separator achieves an energy density of 417&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 based on the whole cell and a stable running of 100 cycles under practical operation conditions (cathode loading = 10.0&#8201;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2, negative/positive areal capacity ratio (N/P ratio) = 2, and electrolyte/sulfur weight ratio (E/S ratio) = 2.6&#8201;&#181;L mg&#8722;1). Furthermore, through a systematic evaluation of the as&#8208;prepared Li&#8208;S pouch cell, the study unveils the operational and failure mechanisms of LSBs under practical conditions. The achievement of ultrahigh energy density in such a large&#8208;capacity lithium&#8208;sulfur pouch cell will accelerate the commercialization of LSBs.

         <title>Dirac&#8208;Like Fermions Anomalous Magneto&#8208;Transport in a Spin&#8208;Polarized Oxide 2D Electron System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anomalous magneto&#8208;transport dominated by non&#8208;trivial Berry curvature and Dirac&#8208;like fermions is exhibited by an engineered 2D electron system (2DES) at (111) LaAlO3/EuTiO3/SrTiO3 interface, where structural and electronic properties are tailored to mimic that of magnetic gapped topological insulators.









Abstract
In a 2D electron system (2DES) the breaking of the inversion, time&#8208;reversal and bulk crystal&#8208;field symmetries is interlaced with the effects of spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) triggering exotic quantum phenomena. Here, epitaxial engineering is used to design and realize a 2DES characterized simultaneously by ferromagnetic order, large Rashba SOC and hexagonal band warping at the (111) interfaces between LaAlO3, EuTiO3, and SrTiO3 insulators. The 2DES displays anomalous quantum corrections to the magneto&#8208;conductance driven by the time&#8208;reversal&#8208;symmetry breaking occurring below the magnetic transition temperature. The results are explained by the emergence of a non&#8208;trivial Berry phase and competing weak anti&#8208;localization/weak localization back&#8208;scattering of Dirac&#8208;like fermions, mimicking the phenomenology of gapped topological insulators. These findings open perspectives for the engineering of novel spin&#8208;polarized functional 2DES holding promises in spin&#8208;orbitronics and topological&#160;electronics.

         <title>Bidirectional Photovoltage&#8208;Driven Oxide Transistors for Neuromorphic Visual Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bidirectional photovoltage&#8208;driven neuromorphic visual sensor is constructed by connecting the different electrodes of two perovskite solar cells to the two gates of ion&#8208;regulated In2O3 transistors. The mem&#8208;reservoir chip is also proposed for handing object movement and dynamic color recognition.








Abstract
Biological vision is one of the most important parts of the human perception system. However, emulating biological visuals is challenging because it requires complementary photoexcitation and photoinhibition. Here, the study presents a bidirectional photovoltage&#8208;driven neuromorphic visual sensor (BPNVS) that is constructed by monolithically integrating two perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with dual&#8208;gate ion&#8208;gel&#8208;gated oxide transistors. PSCs act as photoreceptors, converting external visual stimuli into electrical signals, whereas oxide transistors generate neuromorphic signal outputs that can be adjusted to produce positive and negative photoresponses. This device mimics the human vision system's ability to recognize colored and color&#8208;mixed patterns. The device achieves a static color recognition accuracy of 96% by utilizing the reservoir computing system for feature extraction. The BPNVS mem&#8208;reservoir chip is also proposed for handing object movement and dynamic color recognition. This work is a significant step forward in neuromorphic sensing and complex pattern recognition.

         <title>Self&#8208;Trapped Excitons in 3R ZnIn2S4 with Broken Inversion Symmetry for High&#8208;Performance Photodetection</title>

The 2D 3R&#8208;phase ZnIn2S4 with broken inversion symmetry is systematically investigated for its intrinsic self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs). Benefiting from the presence of intrinsic STEs, the photoconductive effects induced by STEs can enhance their applicability in photodetection with remarkable broad&#8208;spectrum performance.

Exploring novel materials with intrinsic self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs) is crucial for advancing optoelectronic technologies. In this study, 2D 3R&#8208;phase ZnIn2S4, featuring broken inversion symmetry, is introduced to investigate intrinsic STEs. This material exhibits a broadband photoluminescence (PL) emission with a full width at half maximum of 164&#160;nm and a large Stokes shift of &#8776;0.6&#160;eV, which arises from the distortion of [ZnS4]6&#8208; tetrahedral unit induced by the symmetry breaking and strong electron&#8208;phonon coupling. The photophysical properties of the STEs exhibit a high Huang&#8208;Rhys factor (15.0), rapid STEs formation time (166&#160;fs), and extended STEs lifetime (1039&#160;ps), as demonstrated by experimental evidence from temperature&#8208;dependent PL, Raman spectroscopy, and ultrafast absorption spectroscopy. Additionally, STE&#8208;induced photoconductive&#160;effect is elucidated, indicating that intrinsic STEs in 3R&#8208;ZnIn2S4 can provide a synergistic effect that enhances absorption capacity, localization, and lifetime by capturing the self&#8208;trapped hole state. Consequently, the 2D 3R&#8208;ZnIn2S4 photodetector exhibits remarkable broad&#8208;spectrum photosensitivity, including a photo&#8208;switching ratio of 11286, response times of less than 0.6&#160;ms, responsivity of 15.2&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1, detectivity of 1.02&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#185;&#185; Jones, and external quantum efficiency of 5032% under 375&#160;nm light. These findings provide new ideas for exploring materials with intrinsic STEs to achieve novel high&#8208;performance photodetector applications.

&lt;p&gt;The 2D 3R-phase ZnIn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; with broken inversion symmetry is systematically investigated for its intrinsic self-trapped excitons (STEs). Benefiting from the presence of intrinsic STEs, the photoconductive effects induced by STEs can enhance their applicability in photodetection with remarkable broad-spectrum performance.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Induced Tunable Enhancement of Piezoelectricity in a Novel Molecular Multiferroic Material</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This is the first strain engineering in molecular ionic multiferroics. Under a strain of 2.0%, a tenfold increase in piezoelectric performance and a significant reduction of 50% in the ferroelectric coercive field are observed, which unveils a novel strategy to augment the performance of molecular multiferroics.








Abstract
Multiferroics are appealing because of application potentials in data storage devices, sensors, transducers, and energy harvesters. Molecular multiferroics emerge as a promising alternative to inorganic multiferroics due to flexibility, light weight, low toxicity, solution processing, structural diversity, and chemical tunability. While researches have predominantly focused on perovskite structures, studies on molecular ionic multiferroics remain relatively limited. It is urgent to creatively build a novel platform for studying and developing the coupling and interaction between the stress, electricity, and magnetism. Knowing this, the work focuses on a novel organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid multiferroic N&#8208;ethyl&#8208;N&#8208;(fluoromethyl)&#8208;N&#8208;methylethylammonium tetrabromoferrate (III) showing coexisting magnetic and electric orderings. It undergoes antiferromagnetic, ferroelectric, and ferroelastic transitions. Notably, under a strain of 2.0%, the piezoelectric response increases tenfold, and the coercive field of ferroelectric polarization is reduced by half. The strain&#8208;induced enhancement of piezoelectricity is rarely reported in molecular multiferroics. Density functional theory is employed to predict that the mechanism of the large piezoelectric response under strain engineering is related to the cation rotation and phase switching between the stable phase and an energetically competitive metastable phase. This study creates a new paradigm to develop molecular multiferroics and future microelectronic devices for energy conversion.

         <title>Evidence of Quasi&#8208;Na Metallic Clusters in Sodium Ion Batteries through In Situ X&#8208;Ray Diffraction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly defective ultrathin carbon nanosheets&#8208;8 (HDCS&#8208;8) anode uniformly adsorbs Na+ in the high&#8208;voltage slope region, resulting in the formation of small particle hexagonal quasi&#8208;Na metallic clusters. Subsequently, the HDCS&#8208;8 anode transforms the small particle hexagonal systems clusters into large particle orthorhombic systems of quasi&#8208;Na metallic clusters in the low&#8208;voltage region.








Abstract
Carbonaceous materials have been considered the most promising anode in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) due to their low cost, good electrical conductivity, and structural stability. The main challenge of carbonaceous anodes prior to their commercialization is low initial coulomb efficiencies, derived from a lack of an efficient technique to reveal a fundamental comprehension of sodium storage mechanisms. Here, the direct observation of quasi&#8208;Na metallic clusters in carbonaceous anodes during cycling through in situ XRD is reported. By means of such a technique, a strong self&#8208;adsorption behavior forming quasi&#8208;Na metallic clusters is detected within a rationally designed highly defective ultrathin carbon nanosheets (HDCS) anode. Such a self&#8208;adsorption and crystalline system transformation mechanism in HDCS brings capacity retention about 100% after 1000 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1. This work provides a new principle for designing high&#8208;performance carbon anodes for SIBs.

         <title>Disrupting Intracellular Homeostasis by Copper&#8208;Based Nanoinducer with Multiple Enzyme&#8208;Mimicking Activities to Induce Disulfidptosis&#8208;Enhanced Pyroptosis for Tumor Immunotherapy</title>

         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;based nanoinducer (CGBH NNs) aimed to disrupt intracellular metabolism and redox homeostasis for inducing tumor cells disulfidptosis&#8208;enhanced immunogenic pyroptosis. The combination of these two cell death modes could promote the release of damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns and inflammatory cytokines, reprogramming the immunosuppressive TME and enhancing immune cells infiltration. The evoked robust immune responses helped to suppress tumor progression.








Abstract
Given the crucial role of abnormal homeostasis in tumor cells for maintaining their growth, it may be more efficient with less effort to develop anti&#8208;tumor strategies that target multiple combined mechanisms by disrupting intracellular homeostasis. Here, a copper&#8208;based nanoinducer (CGBH NNs) with multiple enzyme&#8208;like activities is designed and constructed to induce disulfidptosis&#8208;enhanced pyroptosis through disrupting multiple intracellular homeostasis for effective tumor immunotherapy. Within the tumor microenvironment (TME), CGBH NNs can disrupt intracellular glucose homeostasis and inhibit NADPH production, leading to accumulation of cystine, which further blocked the substrate and key enzyme for synthesizing glutathione. Subsequently, through cascade catalytic reactions involving enzyme activities (glutathione peroxidase&#8208;like, glucose oxidase and peroxidase&#8208;like activities), CGBH NNs can produce massive reactive oxygen species&#160;(ROS) and further disrupt intracellular redox homeostasis, resulting in the disulfidptosis&#8208;enhanced pyroptosis. The tumor cells undergoing immunogenic pyroptosis can release various cytosolic contents and inflammatory factors, eliciting robust immune responses by facilitating immune cell infiltration, and reprogramming the immunosuppressive TME. After the combination with immune checkpoint blockade therapy, CGBH NNs can effectively suppress the tumor growth and prolong the survival time of tumor&#8208;bearing mice. This work presents a novel paradigm to trigger disulfidptosis&#8208;enhanced pyroptosis by destroying intracellular homeostasis for anti&#8208;tumor immunotherapy.

         <title>Enhanced Photosensitizer Wettability via Anchoring Competition of Violet Phosphorus Quantum Dots for Breakthroughs in Photodynamic Film Sterilization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a novel strategy to enhance the wettability of photosensitizers in photodynamic films (VP/Hy&#8208;BC films) by anchoring violet phosphorus quantum dots (VPQDs). This approach effectively boosts the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and enhances antibacterial efficacy. Computational modeling and experimental findings demonstrate the promising potential of VP/Hy&#8208;BC films for applications in antibacterial packaging.








Abstract
Wettability is important for photodynamic film sterilization since higher wettability enhances the capture of bacteria in contact with photosensitizers. Herein, a small number of violet phosphorus quantum dots (VPQDs) are anchored into hypericin bacterial cellulose films (VP/Hy&#8208;BC films) to improve wettability, reducing the water contact angle from 56.8&#176; to 33.0&#176;. This modification facilitated more effective interactions between the bacteria and photosensitizers, rapidly inactivating 7 log10 CFU/mL of Staphylococcus aureus within 60&#160;min. First&#8208;principles calculations and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that VPQDs, with their low spatial site resistance, reduced the intermolecular Hy self&#8208;aggregation force. This increased the solvent&#8208;accessible surface area of VP/Hy by &#8776;25.7%, thereby decreasing hydrophobic photosensitizer aggregation. Consequently, more active sites are exposed, remarkably improving the photoelectron transfer efficiency. VP/Hy&#8208;BC demonstrated exceptional efficacy in inhibiting bacterial proliferation; for instance, it extended beef shelf life by up to 10 days.

     alt="Enhanced Photosensitizer Wettability via Anchoring Competition of Violet Phosphorus Quantum Dots for Breakthroughs in Photodynamic Film Sterilization"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work presents a novel strategy to enhance the wettability of photosensitizers in photodynamic films (VP/Hy-BC films) by anchoring violet phosphorus quantum dots (VPQDs). This approach effectively boosts the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and enhances antibacterial efficacy. Computational modeling and experimental findings demonstrate the promising potential of VP/Hy-BC films for applications in antibacterial packaging.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wettability is important for photodynamic film sterilization since higher wettability enhances the capture of bacteria in contact with photosensitizers. Herein, a small number of violet phosphorus quantum dots (VPQDs) are anchored into hypericin bacterial cellulose films (VP/Hy-BC films) to improve wettability, reducing the water contact angle from 56.8&#176; to 33.0&#176;. This modification facilitated more effective interactions between the bacteria and photosensitizers, rapidly inactivating 7 log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; CFU/mL of &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; within 60&#160;min. First-principles calculations and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that VPQDs, with their low spatial site resistance, reduced the intermolecular Hy self-aggregation force. This increased the solvent-accessible surface area of VP/Hy by &#8776;25.7%, thereby decreasing hydrophobic photosensitizer aggregation. Consequently, more active sites are exposed, remarkably improving the photoelectron transfer efficiency. VP/Hy-BC demonstrated exceptional efficacy in inhibiting bacterial proliferation; for instance, it extended beef shelf life by up to 10 days. The findings of this study will aid the development of health-conscious, eco-friendly, and efficient antimicrobial packaging films.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Boosting Carrier Transport in Quasi&#8208;2D/3D Perovskite Heterojunction for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite/Organic Tandems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A quasi&#8208;2D/3D heterojunction&#8208;based WBG perovskite is constructed to repair the surface defects and weaken the quantum&#8208;well confinement effect. These advances reduce interfacial carrier transport loss, contributing to balanced carrier recombination in the interconnecting layer. The resulting perovskite/organic tandems exhibit record power conversion efficiencies of 25.92% (0.0628&#160;cm2) and 24.63% (1.004&#160;cm2), as well as robust operational stability.








Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskites are continuously in the limelight owing to their applicability in tandem solar cells. The main bottlenecks of WBG perovskites are interfacial non&#8208;radiative recombination and carrier transport loss caused by interfacial defects and large energy&#8208;level offsets, which induce additional energy losses when WBG perovskites are stacked with organic solar cells in series because of unbalanced carrier recombination in interconnecting layer (ICL). To solve these issues, 1,3&#8208;propanediammonium iodide (PDADI) is incorporated to form Dion&#8211;Jacobson &#8208;phase quasi&#8208;2D perovskites with mixed high&#8208;n&#8208;values in WBG perovskites. PDADI simultaneously repairs the shallow/deep defects and establishes a Type&#8208;II energy&#8208;level alignment between quasi&#8208;2D/3D and 3D perovskites for rapid carrier extraction. More importantly, the short&#8208;chain diammonium cation in quasi&#8208;2D perovskite with high n&#8208;values results in a short Pb&#8211;I inorganic layer spacing, which enhances the interlayer electronic coupling and weakens the quantum&#8208;well confinement effect that restricts carrier transport. The suppressed transport loss increases the electron concentration in the ICL for balanced carrier recombination. The 0.0628 and 1.004 cm2 perovskite/organic tandems achieve remarkable efficiencies of 25.92% and 24.63%, respectively. The quasi&#8208;2D capping layer can inhibit ion migration, allowing perovskite/organic tandems to show excellent operational stability (T85 &gt;&#160;1000&#160;h).

         <title>Substantially Enhanced Spin Polarization in Epitaxial CrTe2 Quantum Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A firm and clear picture of the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane spin texture indeed gives direct evidence of the intrinsic effective spin polarization of CrTe2. Atomic&#8208;layer&#8208;dependent spin&#8208;resolved measurements show a significantly enhanced spin polarization in a 3 ML CrTe2 film, opens up an exciting opportunity to investigate exotic spin physics in 2D limit.








Abstract
2D van der Waals (vdW) magnets, which extend to the monolayer (ML) limit, are rapidly gaining prominence in logic applications for low&#8208;power electronics. To improve the performance of spintronic devices, such as vdW magnetic tunnel junctions, a large effective spin polarization of valence electrons is highly desired. Despite its considerable significance, direct probe of spin polarization in these 2D magnets has not been extensively explored. Here, using 2D vdW ferromagnet of CrTe2 as a prototype, the spin degrees of freedom in the thin films are directly probed using Mott polarimetry. The electronic band of 50 ML CrTe2 thin film, spanning the Brillouin zone, exhibits pronounced spin&#8208;splitting with polarization peaking at 7.9% along the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction. Surprisingly, atomic&#8208;layer&#8208;dependent spin&#8208;resolved measurements show a significantly enhanced spin polarization in a 3 ML CrTe2 film, achieving 23.4% polarization even in the absence of an external magnetic field. The demonstrated correlation between spin polarization and film thickness highlights the pivotal influence of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, interlayer interactions, and itinerant behavior on these properties, as corroborated by theoretical analysis. This groundbreaking experimental verification of intrinsic effective spin polarization in CrTe2 ultrathin films marks a significant advance in establishing 2D ferromagnetic atomic layers as a promising platform for innovative vdW&#8208;based spintronic devices.

         <title>Intratumoral Injectable Redox&#8208;Responsive Immune Niche Improves the Abscopal Effect in Radiotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intratumoral injectable nanofiber&#8208;based tumor immune niche (TIN) is engineered with redox&#8208;responsive IL&#8208;2 nanogels (NGs), &#945;&#8208;CTLA&#8208;4 NGs, and poly(I:C). The TIN converts X&#8208;ray radiotherapy (XRT)&#8208;treated tumor into in situ cancer vaccine by expanding neoantigen&#8208;specific tumor&#8208;infiltrating lymphocytes at the treated primary tumor site, thereby eliciting robust systemic anticancer activity.








Abstract
Radiotherapy (XRT) is often utilized to improve the immune checkpoint blockade response in cancer management. Such combination treatment can enhance the abscopal effect, facilitating a prolonged and durable systemic response. However, despite intense research efforts, only a minority of patients respond to this approach, and novel strategies to increase the abscopal effect are urgently needed. Here, the development of an intratumoral (i.t.) injectable nanofiber (NF)&#8208;based tumor immune niche (TIN) that converts XRT&#8208;treated tumors into an in situ cancer vaccine, eliciting robust systemic antitumor immunity, is reported. This NF&#8208;based immune niche incorporates redox&#8208;degradable anti&#8208;CTLA&#8208;4 (&#945;&#8208;CTLA&#8208;4) nanogels (NGs) and interleukin&#8208;2 (IL&#8208;2) NGs for controlled release in hypoxic irradiated tumors, reversing the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment into a pro&#8208;inflammatory microenvironment, and expanding the tumor&#8208;infiltrating CD8+ T cell population. Additionally, it is functionalized with polyinosinic&#8208;polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) to promote antigen&#8208;presenting cell maturation and prime neoantigen&#8208;specific CD8+ T cells. In vitro studies demonstrate TIN's ability to prime antigen&#8208;specific CD8+ T cells and increase antigen&#8208;specific cell&#8208;killing efficiency under in vitro immunosuppressive conditions. In vivo studies confirm TIN's ability to elicit robust systemic anticancer activity in mouse melanoma and colorectal cancer models without inducing severe immune&#8208;related adverse events.

         <title>Wearable Haptics for Orthotropic Actuation Based on Perpendicularly Nested Auxetic SMA Knotting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wearable haptics for orthotropic actuation (WHOA) can be used for teleoperation of drones and robots with directional sensory perception in 3D space. The perpendicularly nested auxetic pattern with parylene coating provide orthotopically decoupled tactile feedback and wearable multimodal haptics.








Abstract
Smart wearable tactile systems, designed to deliver different types of touch feedback on human skin, can significantly improve engagement through diverse actuation patterns in virtual or augmented reality environments. Here, a perpendicularly nested auxetic wearable haptic interface is reported for orthotropically decoupled multimodal actuation (WHOA), capable of producing diverse tactile feedback modes with 3D sensory perception. WHOA incorporates shape memory alloy wires that are intricately knotted into an auxetic structure oriented along orthotropic dual axes. Its perpendicularly nested auxetic structure enables orthotropic actuation, allowing independent expansion and contraction along both x and y&#8208;axes, as confirmed by force&#8208;strain and displacement&#8208;time performance tests. Additionally, the perylene coating provides orthogonal electrical isolation to WHOA, allowing for stripe&#8208;specific localized actuation and enabling multiple tactile feedback modes. As an orthotropic wearable haptic interface, WHOA distinguishes between x&#8208;axis and y&#8208;axis directions and ultimately delivers multi&#8208;dimensional information regarding movements in 3D space through tactile feedback. As a result, when worn on the foot or arm, WHOA naturally delivers spatiotemporal tactile information to the user, facilitating navigation and teleoperation with 3D sensory perception.

The perpendicularly nested auxetic pattern with parylene coating provide orthotopically decoupled tactile feedback and wearable multimodal haptics.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smart wearable tactile systems, designed to deliver different types of touch feedback on human skin, can significantly improve engagement through diverse actuation patterns in virtual or augmented reality environments. Here, a perpendicularly nested auxetic wearable haptic interface is reported for orthotropically decoupled multimodal actuation (WHOA), capable of producing diverse tactile feedback modes with 3D sensory perception. WHOA incorporates shape memory alloy wires that are intricately knotted into an auxetic structure oriented along orthotropic dual axes. Its perpendicularly nested auxetic structure enables orthotropic actuation, allowing independent expansion and contraction along both &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;y-&lt;/i&gt;axes, as confirmed by force-strain and displacement-time performance tests. Additionally, the perylene coating provides orthogonal electrical isolation to WHOA, allowing for stripe-specific localized actuation and enabling multiple tactile feedback modes. As an orthotropic wearable haptic interface, WHOA distinguishes between &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;-axis and &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;-axis directions and ultimately delivers multi-dimensional information regarding movements in 3D space through tactile feedback. As a result, when worn on the foot or arm, WHOA naturally delivers spatiotemporal tactile information to the user, facilitating navigation and teleoperation with 3D sensory perception.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biomimetic Structural Hydrogels Reinforced by Gradient Twisted Plywood Architectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the structural design of natural structural hydrogels in crustacean exoskeletons, this work presents a synergistic approach for constructing hierarchical structural hydrogels with gradient twisted plywood structure. The structural hydrogels achieve an unprecedented combination of ultrahigh strength, modulus, and toughness, coupled with recorded high fatigue threshold, superior impact resistance, and programmable shape morphing capability.








Abstract
Naturally structural hydrogels such as crustacean exoskeletons possess a remarkable combination of seemingly contradictory properties: high strength, modulus, and toughness coupled with exceptional fatigue resistance, owing to their hierarchical structures across multiple length scales. However, replicating these unique mechanical properties in synthetic hydrogels remains a significant challenge. This work presents a synergistic approach for constructing hierarchical structural hydrogels by employing cholesteric liquid crystal self&#8208;assembly followed by nanocrystalline engineering. The resulting hydrogels exhibit a long&#8208;range ordered gradient twisted plywood structure with high crystallinity to mimic the design of crustacean exoskeletons. Consequently, the structural hydrogels achieve an unprecedented combination of ultrahigh strength (46&#160;&#177;&#160;3&#160;MPa), modulus (496&#160;&#177;&#160;25&#160;MPa), and toughness (170&#160;&#177;&#160;14&#160;MJ m&#8722;3), together with recorded high fatigue threshold (32.5&#160;kJ m&#8722;2) and superior impact resistance (48&#160;&#177;&#160;2&#160;kJ m&#8722;1). Additionally, through controlling geometry and compositional gradients of the hierarchical structures, a programmable shape morphing process allows for the fabrication of complex 3D hydrogels. This study not only offers valuable insights into advanced design strategies applicable to a broad range of promising hierarchical materials, but also pave the ways for load&#8208;bearing applications in tissue engineering, wearable devices, and soft robotics.

This study introduces a novel single&#8208;step proximity vapor transfer technique to develop large, transparent neuromorphic devices using van der Waals materials. The device exhibits biological synapse&#8208;like behavior, supporting logic gate operations, neurotransmission, and imaging. This method advances neuromorphic computing by simplifying 2D material fabrication, paving the way for efficient synaptic devices crucial for artificial intelligence development.








Abstract
Neuromorphic computing, which involves the creation of artificial synapses capable of mimicking biological brain activity, has intrigued researchers in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). To advance neuromorphic computing, a highly efficient 2D material&#8208;based artificial synapse capable of performing logical and arithmetic operations must be developed. However, fabricating large, uniform films or high&#8208;quality structures of 2D materials remains challenging because of their multistep and complex fabrication processes. In the present study, to produce large (&#216; &#8776; 3 in.), uniform, transparent neuromorphic devices, a novel single&#8208;step approach called proximity vapor transfer (PVT) that utilizes van der Waals (vdW) materials is employed. This single&#8208;step technique, which involves the fabrication of vdW materials on various substrates (glass, ITO, AZO, Mo, and Cu), allows control of the thickness and bandgap tunability. The Schottky device developed via the PVT method using vdW SnS with neurotransmitter (acetylcholine)&#8208;like functionality emulates biological synapses and exhibits photoelectronic synaptic behavior with wide&#8208;field&#8208;of&#8208;view synaptic plasticity. In addition, logic gate operations (NOT, OR, AND), reward&#8208;cascade neurotransmission, and imaging can be performed using 3 &#215; 3 arrays of the device. This study represents a significant step toward the development of transparent and large&#8208;area synaptic devices, which are crucial for advancing AI applications.

         <title>Albumin&#8208;Chaperoned Deep&#8208;NIR Triarylmethane Dyes for High&#8208;Contrast In Vivo Imaging and Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
NIR&#8208;phototherapy necessitates bright, stable, biocompatible fluorophores absorbing/emitting beyond 800 nm. Molecular engineering guidelines are established that brightness may be improved via rigidification, stability via steric shielding, and biocompatibility via the installation of multiple water&#8208;soluble groups. Nevertheless, the resulting fluorochromic scaffold is expected to be synthetically challenging. BSA&#8208;chaperoning of a structurally flexible deep NIR&#8208;absorbing dye is a feasible solution to the problem.








Abstract
Fluorophores absorbing/emitting in the deep near&#8208;infrared (deep NIR) spectral region, that is, 800 nm and beyond, hold great promise for in vivo bioimaging, diagnosis, and phototherapy due to deeper tissue penetration. The bottleneck is the lack of bright, stable, and readily synthesized deep NIR fluorophores. Here, it is reported that the albumin&#8208;chaperon strategy is a viable one&#8208;for&#8208;all strategy to address these difficulties. A focused library of deep&#8208;NIR absorbing dyes (EA5) is easily synthesized via a two&#8208;step cascade. They are neither very stable nor bright in phosphate buffer&#160;due to a propeller&#8208;type flexible scaffold. Through screening, EA5_c3 is found to exhibit a high affinity toward bovine serum albumin (BSA). Binding&#8208;associated structural rigidification resulted in a gigantic 26&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement. The albumin chaperone also greatly improved the stability of EA5_c3 by shielding the bisbenzannulated triarylmethane core from nucleophilic or oxidative species. The resulting EA5_c3@BSA exhibits high biocompatibility. It offered high&#8208;resolution vasculature, lymph systems, tumors, and other tissue imaging with its bright deep NIR emission. At the same time, it exhibits prominent potential in photoacoustic imaging and photothermal treatment of subcutaneous and orthotopic breast tumors. These findings provide insights into robust and high&#8208;performance fluorophores with deep NIR regions for theranostic against aggressive cancers.

         <title>Boosting the Structural and Electrochemical Stability of Chloride&#8208;Ion&#8208;Conducting Perovskite Solid Electrolytes by Alkali Ion Doping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkali ion doping is proposed to endow the CsSnCl3 solid electrolyte with a robust cubic structure against broad temperature variations at 213&#8722;473 K or a high relative humidity of 90%. Mild annealing further modifies the microstructure, resulting in a two fold increase in chloride ion conductivity and impressive electrochemical stability in various solid&#8208;state chloride ion batteries.








Abstract
The use of chloride&#8208;based solid electrolytes derived from Lewis acid&#8210;base reactions enables the construction of various new rechargeable batteries, such as chloride ion batteries (CIBs). However, a critical problem with these electrolytes is their poor stability under low&#8208;temperature, moist, or electrochemical conditions, which can lead to deterioration of the phase structure and a loss of ion conduction. Herein, the robust cubic structure of tin&#8208;based perovskite chloride&#8212;a chloride ion conductor&#8212;is achieved by alkali ion doping at the tin site via direct mechanical milling. The as&#8208;prepared cubic CsSn0.925Na0.075Cl2.925 (CSNC) electrolyte exhibits outstanding structural stability over a broad temperature range of 213&#8722;473 K or under a high relative humidity of up to 90%, at which the typical chloride electrolytes previously reported deteriorate because of moisture. Importantly, mild annealing can modify the microstructure of the CSNC, resulting in a two fold increase in ionic conductivity and an increase in electrochemical stability, which is superior to those of other chloride electrolytes reported in previous studies. The effective chloride&#8208;ion transfer and wide electrochemical window of the CSNC are further demonstrated in different solid&#8208;state CIBs.

The effective chloride-ion transfer and wide electrochemical window of the CSNC are further demonstrated in different solid-state CIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Redox&#8208;Bipolar Covalent Organic Framework Cathode for Advanced Sodium&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A neoteric strategy is put forward using a redox&#8208;bipolar covalent organic framework cathode constructed from aniline&#8208;fused quinonoid units to explore the ion co&#8208;storage characteristics in sodium&#8208;ion batteries. With this delicate structure and special storage mode, the resultant cathode shows impressive electrochemical properties at a wide temperature range, and all&#8208;organic sodium ion batteries also showcase the possibility of practical applications.








Abstract
Redox&#8208;active covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising candidates for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, the construction of redox&#8208;bipolar COFs with the anions and cations co&#8208;storage feature for SIBs is rarely reported. Herein, redox&#8208;bipolar COF constructed from aniline&#8208;fused quinonoid units (TPAD&#8208;COF)&#160;is developed as the cathode material in SIBs for the first time. The unique integration of conductive aniline skeletons and quinone redox centers endows TPAD&#8208;COF with high ionic/electrical conductivity, abundant redox&#8208;active sites, and fascinating bipolar features. Consequently, the elaborately tailored TPAD&#8208;COF cathode exhibits higher specific capacity (186.4&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.05&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1) and superior cycling performance (over 2000 cycles at 1.0&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 with 0.015% decay rate per cycle). Impressively, TPAD&#8208;COF also displays a high specific capacity of 101&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 even at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C. As a proof of concept, all&#8208;organic SIBs (AOSIBs) are assembled using TPAD&#8208;COF cathode and disodium terephthalate anode, which also show impressive electrochemical properties, indicating the potential application of TPAD&#8208;COF cathode in AOSIBs. The work will pave the avenue toward advanced COFs cathode for rechargeable batteries through rational molecular design.

         <title>Regulating the Local Spin States in Spinel Oxides to Promote the Activity of Li&#8208;CO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study regulates the local spin states by incorporating Ni into Co3O4 and explores their impact on activity in Li&#8208;CO2 batteries. High spin Ni ions facilitate electron transfer from the catalyst to the unoccupied orbitals of CO2, providing sufficient active sites for the nucleation and growth of small Li2CO3 crystals, thereby improving reversibility.








Abstract
Due to the high energy barrier, slow reaction kinetics, and complex reaction environments of Li&#8208;CO2 batteries, the development of durable and efficient catalysts is essential. Transition metal oxides are promising for their availability, stability, and 3d electronic features, with spin states playing an important role in CO2 activation. In this study, the local spin states are regulated by incorporating Ni into Co3O4 and its impact on activity in Li&#8208;CO2 batteries is explored. The results show that Ni atoms with high spin states in Ni0.1Co2.9O4 facilitate electron transfer from the catalyst to the unoccupied orbitals of CO2, providing sufficient active sites for the nucleation and growth of small Li2CO3 crystals. These small crystals have a low decomposition barrier, leading to improved battery efficiency. Therefore, Ni0.1Co2.9O4 shows superior catalytic performance with an overpotential of 0.72&#160;V and an energy efficiency of &#8776;70% after 500&#160;h. This work provides insights into the relationship between spin states and CO2 reactions, highlighting a promising avenue for developing high&#8208;performance metal&#8208;CO2 batteries.

         <title>Observation of Highly Spin&#8208;Polarized Dangling Bond Surface States in Rare&#8208;Earth Pnictide Tellurides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique type of surface states in a family of ternary rare&#8208;earth pnictide tellurides with robust band structure and sizeable spin splitting is realized. Spin ARPES measurements reveal high spin polarization and distinct spin&#8208;momentum locking texture, arising from local site asymmetry and surface&#8208;purified spin&#8208;orbital texture. This work presents an intriguing spin&#8208;orbital&#8208;momentum&#8208;layer locking phenomenon, shedding lights on potential spintronic applications.








Abstract
To generate and manipulate spin&#8208;polarized electronic states in solids are crucial for modern spintronics. The textbook routes employ quantum well states or Shockley/topological type surface states whose spin degeneracy is lifted by strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling and inversion symmetry breaking at the surface/interface. The resultant spin polarization is usually truncated because of the intertwining between multiple orbitals. Here a unique type of surface states is realized, namely, dangling bond surface states in a family of ternary rare&#8208;earth pnictide tellurides RePnTe (Re = La, Gd, Ce; Pn = Sb, Bi), with robust band structure and sizeable spin splitting. Spin and angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements reveal high spin polarization and distinct spin&#8208;momentum locking texture, which, according to the theoretical analysis, arise from local site asymmetry and surface&#8208;purified spin&#8208;orbital texture. The work extends the so&#8208;called &#8220;hidden spin polarization&#8221; from the bulk to the surface, presenting an intriguing spin&#8208;orbital&#8208;momentum&#8208;layer locking phenomenon, which may shed lights on potential spintronic applications.

         <title>Vacancies Engineering in Molybdenum Boride MBene Nanosheets to Activate Room&#8208;Temperature Ferromagnetism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The experimental realization of 2D Mo&#8208;vacancy molybdenum boride (Mo4/3B2) MBene nanosheets is demonstrated with intrinsic room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetic character by selectively etching bulk MAB phase (Mo2/3Y1/3)2AlB2. The Mo4/3B2 nanosheets show robust intrinsic ferromagnetic properties with a saturation magnetic moment of 0.044&#160;emu&#160;g&#8722;1 at 300&#160;K.








Abstract
The rapid development of low energy dissipation spintronic devices has stimulated the search for air&#8208;stable 2D nanomaterials possessing room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism. Here the experimental realization of 2D Mo4/3B2 nanosheets is reported with intrinsic room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetic characteristics by vacancy engineering. These nanosheets are synthesized by etching the bulk MAB phase (Mo2/3Y1/3)2AlB2 into Mo4/3B2 nanosheets in ZnCl2 molten salt. The Mo4/3B2 nanosheets show robust intrinsic ferromagnetic properties, with a saturation magnetic moment of 0.044&#160;emu&#160;g&#8722;1 at 300&#160;K, while vacancy&#8208;free MoB MBene exhibits paramagnetism. It is elucidated that the Mo&#8208;vacancy defect generates large density of states near the Fermi surface and spontaneously spin&#8208;split bands through first&#8208;principles calculations, which contributes to the non&#8208;zero magnetic moment in Mo4/3B2 nanosheets. This work lays the groundwork for activating the magnetic properties of MBene nanosheets by vacancy engineering, offering the possibilities for development of practical spintronic devices.

The Mo&lt;sub&gt;4/3&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets show robust intrinsic ferromagnetic properties, with a saturation magnetic moment of 0.044&#160;emu&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 300&#160;K, while vacancy-free MoB MBene exhibits paramagnetism. It is elucidated that the Mo-vacancy defect generates large density of states near the Fermi surface and spontaneously spin-split bands through first-principles calculations, which contributes to the non-zero magnetic moment in Mo&lt;sub&gt;4/3&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets. This work lays the groundwork for activating the magnetic properties of MBene nanosheets by vacancy engineering, offering the possibilities for development of practical spintronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrahigh Energy Storage of Twisted Structures in Supramolecular Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using machine learning, a variety of PU&#8208;based polymers are forecasted and successfully synthesized two with a high dielectric constant (K) and thermal stability. Combining these with PI via hydrogen bonds to form twisted HNP, both K and Eb are improved. Impressively, HNP&#8208;20% reaches an Ud of 6.42 J&#160;cm&#8722;3 and an efficiency exceeding 90% at 200&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Polymer dielectrics possess outstanding advantages for high&#8208;power energy storage applications such as high breakdown strength (Eb) and efficiency (&#951;), while both of them decrease rapidly at elevated temperatures. Although several strategies have been evaluated to enhance Eb and heat resistance, the discharged energy density (Ud) is still limited by the planar conjugated structure. In this study, a novel approach to manipulate polymer morphology is introduced, thereby influencing dielectric properties. A range of polyurea (PU)&#8208;based polymers are predicted from different structural unit combinations by machine learning and synthesized two representative polymers with high dielectric constants (K) and thermal stability. These polymers are combined with PI to form a twisted polymer via hydrogen bonding interactions (HNP). Both experimental results and computational simulations demonstrate the twisted structure disrupts the conjugated structure to widen the bandgap and increase dipole moment through the twisting of polar groups, leading to simultaneous improvements in both K and Eb. Consequently, HNP&#8208;20% achieves an ultrahigh Ud of 6.42 J&#160;cm&#8722;3 with an efficiency exceeding 90% at 200 &#176;C. This work opens a new avenue to scalable high Ud all&#8208;polymer dielectric for high&#8208;temperature applications.

         <title>Chiral Nematic Graphene Films with a mesoporous Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel chiral&#8208;template&#8208;directed chemical vapor deposition method is presented for the precise fabrication of chiral nematic graphene film, which exhibits uniform Na plating without dendrite formation and noteworthy thickness&#8208;dependent electromagnetic shielding performance. This work paves the way for creating a large family of chiral nematic materials in various applications of photoelectric conversion, energy storage, electromagnetism, and separation.








Abstract
Ordering a crucial material like pure&#8208;graphene into the chiral nematic structure can potentially revolutionize the fields of photonics, chiral separation, and energy storage. However, the controlled fabrication of highly ordered graphene films with a long&#8208;range chiral nematic mesoporous structure is very challenging and as such, has not been achieved. Here, a chiral&#8208;template&#8208;directed chemical vapor deposition growth strategy is presented for the precise fabrication of mesoporous chiral nematic graphene films by using nanocrystalline cellulose as templates. It is evidenced that such graphene films possess the left&#8208;hand helical ordering, chiral nematic mesoporous structure with adjustable pore sizes (6.4&#8211;13.1&#160;nm), tailored pitch, excellent electrical conductivity (556 S cm&#8722;1), high specific surface area (1508 m2&#160;g&#8722;1) and mechanical flexibility. By coating Na anode with this film, uniform Na plating is achieved with no dendrite formation, resulting from its unique chiral nematic structure and tunable physicochemical properties. The films also achieved impressive thickness&#8208;dependent electromagnetic shielding, i.e., 35&#8211;63&#160;dB, demonstrating their potentially multi&#8208;disciplinary applications.

         <title>Carboxylic Acid&#8208;Functionalized Cellulose Hydrogel Electrolyte for Dual&#8208;Interface Stabilization in Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique one&#8208;gel&#8208;for&#8208;two&#8208;electrodes strategy is developed to simultaneously solve the challenges at both anode and cathode interfaces in aqueous zinc batteries. By constructing a carboxylic acid&#8208;functionalized cellulose hydrogel electrolyte, the solvation structure of Zn2+ at Zn anode and the unfavored deposition of byproducts at phenazine cathode can be effectively regulated, thus enabling the dendrite&#8208;free and side reaction&#8208;suppressed aqueous zinc batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc batteries (AZBs) are considered one of the most promising candidates for grid&#8208;scale energy storage. However, achieving a stable electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface remains a challenge for developing high&#8208;performance AZBs. Herein, taking the Zn||phenazine (PNZ) system as a prototype, where the proton uptake/removal mechanism dominates in the cathode, a carboxylic acid&#8208;functionalized cellulose hydrogel electrolyte is designed to simultaneously solve the issues at both the anode and cathode interfaces. Specifically, the hydrogel electrolyte can not only regulate Zn2+ ions at the Zn anode side but also supply H+ ions at the PNZ cathode side to avoid the unfavored deposition of zinc sulfate hydroxides. Benefiting from the unique one&#8208;gel&#8208;for&#8208;two&#8208;electrodes strategy, the dendrite&#8208;free and side reaction&#8208;suppressed aqueous Zn||PNZ cells are developed with a high specific capacity (311 mAh g&#8722;1, 99% utilization of the theoretical capacity) and a long cycle life (over 1500 cycles within 2 months). This study proposes a facile and low&#8208;cost electrolyte strategy for stabilizing AZBs.

         <title>Greatly Enhanced Oxygen Reduction Reaction in Anion Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell and Zn&#8208;Air Battery via Hole Inner Edge Reconstruction of 2D Pd Nanomesh</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A widespread hole inner edge reconstruction (HIER) phenomenon as overstretched outermost crystal facets is revealed in Pd nanomeshes prepared through a facile gram&#8208;scale room&#8208;temperature reduction method. Contributed by the HIER phenomenon, a tremendous improvement in the electrocatalytic activity is identified, which significantly improved the anion exchange membrane fuel cells and Zn&#8208;air batteries assembled with Pd NM/C cathode catalyst.








Abstract
Platinum group metals (PGM) have yet to be the most active catalysts in various sustainable energy reactions. Their high cost, however, has made maximizing the activity and minimizing the dosage become an urgent priority for the practical applications of emerging technologies. Herein, a novel 2D&#160;Pd nanomesh structure possessing hole inner reconstructed edges (HIER) with exposed high energy facets and overstretched lattice parameters is fabricated through a facile room&#8208;temperature reduction method at gram&#8208;scale yields. The HIER enhances the catalytic performance of Pd in electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), achieving superior mass activity (MA) of 2.672 A mgPd&#8722;1, which is 27.8 fold and 23.6 fold higher, respectively, than those of the commercial Pt/C (0.096 A mgPt&#8722;1) and Pd/C (0.113 A mgPd&#8722;1) at 0.9 VRHE. Most significantly, in H2&#8208;air anion exchange membrane fuel cell (AEMFC) and Zn&#8208;air battery (ZAB) applications, this unique Pd catalyst delivers a much&#8208;outperformed peak power density of 0.86 and 0.22&#160;W cm&#8722;2, respectively, compared with 0.54 and 0.13&#160;W cm&#8722;2 of the commercial Pt/C catalyst, indicating a novel pathway in electrocatalyst designs through HIER engineering.

         <title>Unlocking the Trade&#8208;off Between Intrinsic and Interfacial Thermal Transport of Boron Nitride Nanosheets by Surface Functionalization for Advanced Thermal Interface Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unlocking the trade&#8208;off between the intrinsic and interfacial thermal transport of hexagonal boron nitride nanosheets (BNNS) within thermal interface material. The surface functionalization maintains the intrinsic high thermal conductivity of BNNS while significantly increasing binding energy between micro/nano interfaces in BNNS&#8208;based TIMs, effectively reducing interfacial thermal resistance of BNNS joint interfaces and interfaces between BNNSs and the matrix.








Abstract
The increasing computing power of AI presents a major challenge for high&#8208;power chip solution and heat dissipation. Boron nitride nanosheet&#8208;based thermal interface materials (BNNS&#8208;based TIMs) exhibit excellent electrical insulation property, ensuring the secure and stable operation of chips. However, the efficiency of micro/nano interfacial thermal transport is limited, impeding further enhancements in the thermal conductivity (TC) of BNNS&#8208;based TIMs. Here, a strategy of surface functionalization is reported to unlock the trade&#8208;off between the intrinsic and interfacial thermal transport of BNNS within TIMs. These results suggest that the surface functionalization maintains the intrinsic high TC of BNNS while significantly increasing binding energy between micro/nano interfaces in BNNS&#8208;based TIMs, effectively reducing interfacial thermal resistance of BNNS joint interfaces and interfaces between BNNSs and the matrix by 50% and 26.1%, respectively. The BNNS&#8208;based TIMs exhibit excellent TC (&#8776;21&#8211;25&#160;W/(m&#183;K)) and ultralow Young's modulus, which can promote the development of flexible high&#8208;performance chip cooling technology in the AI industry.

         <title>Synergetic Modulation of Electronic Properties of Cobalt Oxide via &#8220;Tb&#8221; Single Atom for Uphill Urea and Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen (H2) production via water electrolysis benefits from switching the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with the urea oxidation reaction (UOR). The topologically doped rare&#8208;earth single atom &#8216;Tb&#8217; on defective Co3O4 (TbSA@d&#8208;Co3O4) achieves superior UOR performance. The catalyst achieves 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 current density at 1.27&#160;V, &#8722;35&#160;mV, and 1.22&#160;V for UOR, H2 evolution reaction, and Bifunctional UOR electrolyzer, respectively with remarkable stability.








Abstract
Exploring single&#8208;atom (SA) catalysts in hybrid urea&#8208;assisted water electrolysis offers a viable alternative to both Hydrogen (H2) generation and polluted water treatment. However, the unfavorable electronic stabilization, low SA content, intrinsically slow kinetics, and imbalanced adsorption&#8208;desorption steps are the bottleneck for its scale&#8208;up implementation. Herein, a rare&#8208;earth Terbium single atom (TbSA) is topologically stabilized on defect&#8208;rich Co3O4 (TbSA@d&#8208;Co3O4) by Tb&#9472;O co&#8208;ordination for urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and H2 evolution reaction (HER). Benefitting from the strong TbSA interaction with the d&#8208;Co3O4, the TbSA@d&#8208;Co3O4 achieves a 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 current density at 1.27&#160;V and &#8722;35&#160;mV for UOR and HER, respectively. Remarkably, when TbSA@d&#8208;Co3O4 is applied as a bi&#8208;functional catalyst in a two&#8208;electrode system, it merely requires 1.22&#160;V to acquire 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 with excellent operational stability for 100 h. The hybrid electrolyzer can be successfully empowered by the triboelectric nanogenerator, AA battery, and solar panel with a nominal potential of 1.5&#160;V. The mechanistic investigation predicts &#8220;TbSA&#8221; insertion in d&#8208;Co3O4 lowered the potential determining step, attributed to balanced reaction energetics for adsorption&#8208;desorption of intermediates and favorable charge transfer characteristics for UOR. This work offers a new paradigm to explore the catalytic properties of rare&#8208;earth &#8220;f&#8208;block&#8221; elements to create advanced electrocatalysts via structural modulation.

         <title>Reversible Configurations of 3&#8208;Coordinate and 4&#8208;Coordinate Boron Stabilize Ultrahigh&#8208;Ni Cathodes with Superior Cycling Stability for Practical Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

This work demonstrates a Li2SiO3&#8208;coated Li(Ni0.95Co0.04Mn0.01)0.99B0.01O2 ultrahigh&#8208;Ni cathode, delivering a high reversible capacity and superior cycling stability. This is the first time to realize the real B&#8208;doping, which exists in terms of 3&#8208;coordinate and 4&#8208;coordinate configurations with high electrochemical reversibility during de&#8208;/lithiation, greatly stabilizing oxygen anions and impeding Ni&#8208;ion migration with high structure stability and rapid Li&#8208;ion diffusion.








Abstract
Ultrahigh&#8208;Ni layered oxide cathodes are the leading candidate for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy Li&#8208;ion batteries owing to their cost&#8208;effectiveness and ultrahigh capacity. However, the increased Ni content causes larger volume variations and worse lattice oxygen stability during cycling, resulting in capacity attenuation and kinetics hysteresis. Herein, a Li2SiO3&#8208;coated Li(Ni0.95Co0.04Mn0.01)0.99B0.01O2 ultrahigh&#8208;Ni cathode that well&#8208;addresses all the above issues, which is also the first time to realize the real doping of B ions is demonstrated. The as&#8208;obtained cathode delivers a reversible capacity of up to 237.4 mAh g&#8722;1 (924 Wh kg&#8722;1cathode) and a superior capacity retention of 84.2% after 500 cycles at 1C in pouch&#8208;type full&#8208;cells. Advanced characterizations and calculations verify that the boron&#8208;doping is existed in terms of 3&#8208;coordinate and 4&#8208;coordinate configurations and their high electrochemical reversibility during de&#8208;/lithiation, which greatly stabilizes oxygen anions and impedes Ni&#8208;ion migration to Li layer. Furthermore, the B&#8208;doping engineers the primary particle microstructure for better relaxing the lattice strain and accelerating Li&#8208;ion diffusion. This work advances the energy density of cathode materials into the domain of above 900&#8201;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1, and the concept will inspire more intensive study on ultrahigh&#8208;Ni cathodes.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Synthesis of Closed&#8208;Loop Recyclable and Thermally Superinsulating Polyhexahydrotriazine Aerogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The simple one&#8208;step synthesis of closed&#8208;loop recyclable PHT aerogels is presented, which are made from commercially available aromatic amines and PFA. These PHT aerogels display thermal superinsulation, pronounced thermal stability, great mechanical performance, and intrinsic hydrophobicity. Furthermore, PHT aerogels can be depolymerized under acidic aqueous conditions, allowing the monomers to be reused to prepare fresh aerogels.








Abstract
Organic aerogels are an advanced class of materials renowned for their ultralow thermal conductivity and highly porous architecture, making them ideal for applications in thermal insulation, catalysis, and chemical absorption. However, these polymeric networks pose environmental concerns as their permanently crosslinked scaffold makes recycling back to the original monomers virtually impossible. To tackle this issue and develop next&#8208;generation organic aerogel, a set of polyhexahydrotriazine (PHT)&#160;aerogels specifically designed for closed&#8208;loop chemical recycling are prepared. Remarkably, these innovative materials can selectively be synthesized in a one&#8208;step condensation reaction using commercially available aromatic amines.

     alt="One-Step Synthesis of Closed-Loop Recyclable and Thermally Superinsulating Polyhexahydrotriazine Aerogels"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simple one-step synthesis of closed-loop recyclable PHT aerogels is presented, which are made from commercially available aromatic amines and PFA. These PHT aerogels display thermal superinsulation, pronounced thermal stability, great mechanical performance, and intrinsic hydrophobicity. Furthermore, PHT aerogels can be depolymerized under acidic aqueous conditions, allowing the monomers to be reused to prepare fresh aerogels.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic aerogels are an advanced class of materials renowned for their ultralow thermal conductivity and highly porous architecture, making them ideal for applications in thermal insulation, catalysis, and chemical absorption. However, these polymeric networks pose environmental concerns as their permanently crosslinked scaffold makes recycling back to the original monomers virtually impossible. To tackle this issue and develop next-generation organic aerogel, a set of polyhexahydrotriazine (PHT)&#160;aerogels specifically designed for closed-loop chemical recycling are prepared. Remarkably, these innovative materials can selectively be synthesized in a one-step condensation reaction using commercially available aromatic amines. They showcase outstanding thermally insulating performance, along with strong mechanical performance, pronounced thermal stability, and intrinsic hydrophobicity, all achieved without the need for additional modifications. More importantly, these aerogels exhibit quantitative depolymerization under acidic aqueous conditions, achieving high yields and purities of the recovered monomers. The successful preparation of fresh organic aerogels from recycled monomers with nearly identical material properties underscores the efficiency and reliability of this recycling process. The facile one-step synthesis process, combined with the high-performance properties and excellent recyclability of these PHT aerogels, accelerates the advancement of sustainable thermally superinsulating materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Anomalously High Apparent Young's Modulus of Ultrathin Freestanding PZT Films Revealed by Machine Learning Empowered Nanoindentation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A neural network machine learning model is developed to accurately determine the Young's modulus, pretension, and thickness of freestanding films from nanoindentation force&#8211;displacement curves, with which anomalously high Young's modulus is discovered of ultrathin PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 (PZT) film as large as 229.4 &#177; 12.1 GPa. The enhancement is attributed to flexoelectric effect, and the corresponding flexoelectric coefficient is estimated to be &#8776; 200 nC&#160;m&#8722;1.








Abstract
The mechanical properties at small length scales are not only significant for understanding the intriguing size&#8208;dependent behaviors but also critical for device applications. Nanoindentation via atomic force microscopy is widely used for small&#8208;scale mechanical testing, yet determining the Young's modulus of quasi&#8208;2D films from freestanding force&#8211;displacement curve of nanoindentation remains challenging, complicated by both bending and stretching that are highly nonlinear. To overcome these difficulties, a machine learning model is developed based on the back propagation (BP) neural network and finite element training to accurately determine the Young's modulus, pretension, and thickness of freestanding films from nanoindentation force&#8211;displacement curves simultaneously, improving the computational efficiency by two orders of magnitude over conventional brute force curve fitting. Using this technique, anomalously high apparent Young's modulus is discovered of 2.8&#160;nm thick PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 (PZT) film as large as 229.4&#160;&#177;&#160;12.1&#160;GPa, much higher than the bulk value. The enhancement can be attributed to the strain gradient&#8208;induced flexoelectric effect, and the corresponding flexoelectric coefficient is estimated to be &#8776;200&#160;nC&#160;m&#8722;1. The method is developed to enable an artificial intelligence (AI) system to study the mechanical properties of a wide range of low&#8208;dimensional materials.

         <title>Engineered Biomimetic Cancer Cell Membrane Nanosystems Trigger Gas&#8208;Immunometabolic Therapy for Spinal&#8208;Metastasized Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitric oxide (NO) generated by MP@AL&#8208;mediated gas&#8208;immunometabolic therapy inhibited tumor cell respiration, on the one hand, to ensure the continuation of the lactate depletion response and reverse tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment, and on the other hand, NO&#8208;induced tumor immunogenic cell death, synergistically stimulating the immune response and amplifying the efficacy of immunotherapy.








Abstract
Despite great progress in enhancing tumor immunogenicity, conventional gas therapy cannot effectively reverse the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment (TIME), limiting immunotherapy. The development of therapeutic gases that are tumor microenvironment responsive and efficiently reverse the TIME for precisely targeted tumor gas&#8208;immunometabolic therapy remains a great challenge. In this study, a novel cancer cell membrane&#8208;encapsulated pH&#8208;responsive nitric oxide (NO)&#8208;releasing biomimetic nanosystem (MP@AL) is prepared. Lactate oxidase (Lox) in MP@AL consumed oxygen to promote the decomposition of lactate, a metabolic by&#8208;product of tumor glycolysis, and the generation of H2O2, while L&#8208;arginine (L&#8208;Arg) in MP@AL is oxidized by H2O2 to generate nitric oxide (NO). For one thing, NO led to mitochondrial dysfunction in tumor cells to reduce oxygen consumption and promote the efficiency of Lox in lactate decomposition, thus reversing lactate&#8208;induced TIME; for another, NO effectively triggered immunogenic cell death, activated anti&#8208;tumor immune response and long&#8208;term immune memory, and ensured a favorable effect in the synergistic interaction with PD&#8208;L1 antibody for inhibiting tumor growth and recurrence. Therefore, a novel gas&#8208;immunometabolic therapy dual closed&#8208;loop nanosystem for enhancing tumor immunogenicity and remodeling lactate&#8208;induced TIME is established. Overall, this work will provide new ideas for gas therapy to effectively remodel the TIME to enhance cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Congruent Glass Composite Scintillator for Efficient High&#8208;Energy Ray Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The congruent glass composite scintillator with good processing capability&#160;and high scintillation light yield is constructed, which solves the problem of poor preparation and processing properties of scintillation single crystal and ceramic. The constructed glass composite scintillator is further verified in applications such as X&#8208;ray imaging and real&#8208;time radiation detection of fibers. These findings not only represent a novel design concept for the development of glass composite but also suggest a great step for expanding the scope of scintillators.








Abstract
The scintillator is the most crucial component in the high&#8208;energy ray detection system. The available scintillators suffer from the insurmountable drawbacks including poor shaping ability for single crystal and ceramic and low efficiency for glass. Here, a glass composite scintillator is proposed from a congruent crystallization system which possesses both excellent processability and high scintillating yield. It can be fabricated into diverse shapes and sizes including the bulk and tiny fiber. Benefitting from the unique compositing combination with a high crystallization ratio, the glass composite exhibits a giant scintillating light yield of &#8776;26,000 photons per MeV. The practical application for X&#8208;ray imaging is demonstrated and a high spatial resolution of 12 l&#160;p&#160;mm&#8722;1 is achieved. Furthermore, the fiber derived detector is built and the remote and micro&#8208;area detection is realized. These findings not only represent a novel design concept for the development of glass composite but also suggest a great step for expanding the scope of scintillators.

         <title>Dynamic Transition Metal Network via Orbital Population Design Stabilizes Lattice Oxygen Redox in Stoichiometric Layered Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ordered transition metal (TM) network is crucial for the activity and reversibility of lattice oxygen in batteries. A t2g orbital population rule is proposed to guide the design of ordered TM networks, supported by calculated structures and the synthesized ordered TM oxides reported. This work establishes a promising pathway for developing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathodes by controlling TM ordering.








Abstract
Li&#8208;ion batteries employing stoichiometric layered Li metal oxides as cathodes are now reaching the energy density limits due to single cationic redox chemistry. Lattice oxygen redox (LOR) has been discovered in these materials, as a high&#8208;energy&#8208;density paradigm observed in Li&#8208;rich materials. Nevertheless, the origin of this process is not understood, preventing the rational design of better cathode materials. Here, employing stoichiometric Ni&#8208;based cathodes, it is demonstrated that LOR originates from a dynamic transition metal (TM) network caused by ion migration during the electrochemical process. This network is confirmed to be ribbon through both ex&#8208; and in&#8208;situ STEM observations, facilitating reversible LOR. Finally, a t2g orbital population rule is proposed to guide the design of ordered TM networks, supported by calculated structures and the synthesized ordered TM oxides reported. This work explains the mechanism of LOR in stoichiometric layered cathode materials, and sets a promising direction for the design of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathodes through the regulation of TM ordering.

         <title>Superhydrophobicity With Self&#8208;Adaptive Water Pressure Resistance and Adhesion of Pistia Stratiotes Leaf</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pistia stratiotes leaf exhibits superhydrophobicity with high water pressure resistance and low adhesion, attributed to its self&#8208;adaptive deformable microstructure with unique re&#8208;entrant features. Under pressure, these microstructures deform to increase the solid&#8208;liquid contact area, enhancing water pressure resistance. The re&#8208;entrant features elevate the deformation threshold, enabling an effective adaptive response.








Abstract
Superhydrophobic surfaces are promising for optimizing amphibious aircraft by minimizing water drag and adhesion. Achieving this involves ensuring these surfaces can resist high liquid pressure caused by deep water and fluid flow. Maximizing the solid&#8208;liquid contact area is a common strategy to improve liquid pressure resistance. However, this approach inevitably increases solid&#8208;liquid adhesion, making it challenging to guarantee a trade&#8208;off between the two wetting characteristics. Here, it is found that the Pistia stratiotes leaf exhibits superhydrophobicity with high water pressure resistance and low adhesion, attributed to its self&#8208;adaptive deformable microstructure with unique re&#8208;entrant features. Under pressure, these microstructures deform to increase the solid&#8208;liquid contact area, thereby enhancing water pressure resistance. The re&#8208;entrant features elevate the deformation threshold, enabling higher modulus microstructures to achieve adaptive response. This facilitates the recovery of deformed microstructures, restoring the air layer and maintaining low adhesion. Following these concepts, Pistia stratiotes leaf&#8208;inspired surfaces are fabricated, achieving an 183% improvement in water impact resistance and an &#8776;80% reduction in adhesion after overpressure compared to conventional superhydrophobic surfaces. The design principles inspired by Pistia stratiotes promise significant advancements in amphibious aircraft and other trans&#8208;media vehicles.

         <title>In&#8208;Device Ballistic&#8208;Electron&#8208;Emission Spectroscopy for Accurately In Situ Mapping Energy Level Alignment at Metal&#8211;Organic Semiconductors Interface</title>

         <dc:description>
A precise in situ method&#8212;employing in&#8208;device ballistic&#8208;electron&#8208;emission spectroscopy with hot&#8208;electron transistor configuration&#8212;is presented for detecting energy barriers at metal/organic semiconductor interfaces, achieving an accuracy of &#177;0.03&#160;eV. This technique is applicable to n&#8208;type, p&#8208;type and ambipolar semiconductors and can detect subtle barrier changes caused by film treatment processes, providing a reliable tool for organic electronics.








Abstract
Energy level alignment at metal/organic semiconductors (OSCs) interface governs electronic processes in organic electronics devices, making its precise determination essential for understanding carrier transport behaviors and optimizing device performance. However, it is proven that accurately characterizing the energy barrier at metal/OSC interface under operational conditions remains challenging due to the technical limitations of traditional methods. Herein, through integrating highly&#8208;improved device constructions with an ingenious derivative&#8208;assisted data processing method, this study demonstrates an in&#8208;device ballistic&#8208;electron&#8208;emission spectroscopy using hot&#8208;electron transistors to accurately characterize the energy barrier at metal/OSC interface under in&#8208;operando conditions. This technique is found that a remarkable improvement in measurement accuracy, reaching up to &#177;0.03&#160;eV, can be achieved&#8212;surpassing previous techniques (&#177;0.1&#8211;0.2&#160;eV). The high accuracy allows us to monitor subtle changes in energy barriers at metal/OSC interface caused by variations in the aggregation state of OSCs, a phenomenon that is theoretically possible but failed to be directly demonstrated through conventional methods. Moreover, this study makes demonstration that this technology is universally applicable to various metal/OSC interfaces consisting of electron&#8208;transporting, hole&#8208;transporting, and ambipolar OSCs. These findings manifest the great potential of this method to advance both theoretical exploration and technical applications in organic electronics.

         <title>In Situ Encapsulation of Atomically Precise Nanoclusters in Reticular Frameworks via Mechanochemical Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanochemical synthesis approach to encapsulate atomically precise nanoclusters (APNCs) in reticular frameworks in a controlled manner is proposed. This method significantly broadens the range of APNC@framework composites, facilitating the on&#8208;demand construction and regulation of component&#8208;specific nanocomposites.








Abstract
The combination of atomically precise nanoclusters (APNCs) and reticular frameworks is promising for generating component&#8208;specific nanocomposites with emergent properties. However, traditional liquid&#8208;phase synthesis often hampers this potential by damaging APNCs and limiting combination diversity. Here, mechanochemical synthesis to explore the encapsulation of diverse oil&#8208; and water&#8208;soluble APNCs within various reticular frameworks is employed, establishing a database of 21 unique APNC&#8722;framework combinations, including metal&#8722;organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent&#8722;organic frameworks (COFs), hydrogen&#8722;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs), and multivariate MOFs. These framework coatings not only spatially immobilize APNCs but also secure their structures, preventing aggregation and degradation while enhancing stability and activity. Encapsulating Au25 in HOFs resulted in a remarkable 315&#8208;fold increase in catalytic activity compared to Au25 homogeneous catalyst, highlighting the framework's crucial role in catalytic enhancement. The mechanochemical synthesis strategy facilitates tailored support screening, catering to specific needs, and shows promise for developing multifunctional systems, including enzyme&#8722;APNC@frameworks material for cascade reactions.

         <title>Three&#8208;Level Chirality Transfer and Amplification in Liquid Crystal Supramolecular Assembly for Achieving Full&#8208;Color and White Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;level chirality transfer and amplification from point chirality of small molecules to helical chirality of helical polymers and finally to supramolecular chirality of cholesteric liquid crystals consisting of chiral nonfluorescent polymers and nematic liquid crystals is constructed. Full&#8208;color and white CPL are realized via further introducing achiral fluorophores. Anti&#8208;counterfeiting security, information encryption, and chiral logic gate applications are developed.








Abstract
Chiral liquid crystal supramolecular assembly provides an ideal strategy for constructing excellent circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials. However, the chirality transfer in chiral liquid crystals normally occurs at two levels from the configurational chirality to the supramolecular phase chirality. The more precise and more levels of chirality transmission are fascinating but remain challenging. The present work reports the first success of three&#8208;level chirality transfer and amplification from configurationally point chirality of small molecules to conformationally helical chirality of helical polymers and finally to supramolecular phase chirality of cholesteric liquid crystals composed of chiral nonfluorescent polymers (P46) and nematic liquid crystals. Noticeably, the helical twisting power of P46 is five&#8208;fold larger than its monomer. Full&#8208;color and white CPL with maximum luminescence dissymmetry factor up to 1.54 and photoluminescence quantum yield up to 63.8% are realized utilizing helical supramolecular assembly combined with selective reflection mechanism. Also significantly, the electrically stimuli&#8208;responsive CPL switching device as well as anti&#8208;counterfeiting security, information encryption, and chiral logic gate applications are developed. This study deepens the understanding of chirality transfer and amplification across different hierarchical levels.

         <title>Augmenting Protein Degradation Capacity of PROTAC through Energy Metabolism Regulation and Targeted Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>

A strategy is presented to augment the protein degradation capability of proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) by modulating external nutrient supply and employing nanocarrier&#8208;based targeted delivery. The results demonstrate that a reduction in nutrient supply can enhance protein metabolism and significantly improve the therapeutic efficacy of PROTACs when combined with nanocarriers.








Abstract
The ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system (UPS) is responsible for degrading over 70&#8211;80% of cellular proteins. Consequently, proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are developed to induce the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of proteins of interest (POIs) by the UPS. To amplify the therapeutic efficacy of PROTACs, energy metabolism regulation is first harnessed to boost UPS function in tumor cells. Proteomic and ubiquitinome analyzes reveal that total ubiquitinated proteins and proteasome activity are significantly increased in 143B and MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 tumor cells following fasting&#8208;mimicking diet (FMD) treatment. As a result, the degradation efficiency of PROTACs targeting focal adhesion kinase (FAK&#8208;P) or bromodomain&#8208;containing protein 4 (BRD4&#8208;P) is significantly enhanced in FMD&#8208;treated 143B and MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 tumor cells. Then, silica&#8208;coated iron oxide nanoparticles are developed modified with tumor cell membranes for targeted delivery of PROTACs. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and fluorescence imaging confirm that nanocarriers significantly improve the delivery efficiency of PROTACs in FMD&#8208;treated 143B or MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 tumors. In vivo studies demonstrate that the antitumor efficacy of FAK&#8208;P and BRD4&#8208;P is greatly augmented when combined with targeted delivery and FMD treatment. Overall, this study presents a strategy to enhance the efficacy of PROTACs in cancer therapy.

         <title>Durable Organic Coating&#8208;Free Superhydrophobic Metal Surface by Paracrystalline State Formation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic coating&#8208;free durable self&#8208;superhydrophobic metal surface is achieved by a strategy of femtosecond laser element doping microstructuring on Al alloys followed by repetitive low&#8208;temperature annealing in this work. This novel design, which endows the metal surface with properties of unique air storage nanostructures, low free energy, and high chemical stability, can effectively avoid disadvantages of traditional sticking organic modifiers to long&#8208;termly keep the extreme water repellency.








Abstract
The chemical instability of traditional organically&#8208;decorated superhydrophobic metal surfaces is a significant issue, severely limiting practical applications. This is due to the susceptibility of low surface energy coatings to ion permeation, decomposition, and exfoliation, especially in harsh environments. Here, organic coating&#8208;free, durable superhydrophobic surfaces on Al alloys by developing the paracrystalline state of a bionic anthill tribe structure is successfully achieved, using femtosecond laser element&#8208;doping microstructuring followed by repetitive annealing processes. Remarkably, the inherent superhydrophobic properties of the sample are maintained for &#8776;2000 h in a corrosive 3.5 wt.% NaCl aqueous solution, significantly surpassing the performance of traditional organic coatings. Moreover, this inherent superhydrophobicity remains nearly unchanged, even after rigorous electrochemical reaction measurements. Additional tests involving UV irradiation (&gt;100 h), freezing cycles (&gt;100 cycles), and acid/alkali resistance (&gt;65 h) further demonstrate that the environmental adaptability of the surface far exceeds that of silane&#8208;coated surfaces. Ab initio calculations reveal that the formation of the paracrystalline state reduces surface energy and enhances chemical stability, thereby extending the durability of the superhydrophobic metal. These findings offer a powerful strategy for utilizing atomic&#8208;level structural rearrangements to design inherent superhydrophobic surfaces without the need for organic coatings.

         <title>A Synergistically Enhanced Triboelectric&#8208;Electromagnetic Hybrid Generator Enabled by Multifunctional Amorphous Alloy for Highly Efficient Self&#8208;Powered System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating multifunctional Fe72Si8B20 into the hybrid generator not only increases the output current and current retention of TENG by 28.75% and 85.24%, respectively, but also boosts the output power of EMG by 51.05%. Additionally, the variable impedance system effectively utilizes the output characteristics of TENG and EMG, resulting in a 198% improvement in energy utilization efficiency compared to conventional constant impendence systems.








Abstract
Triboelectric&#8208;electromagnetic hybrid generator (TEHG) has emerged as an effective technology for mechanical energy harvesting. However, the independent operation of triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) and electromagnetic generator (EMG), along with tribo&#8208;materials wear and magnetic field divergence, constrain the device's overall performance. To address these challenges, a synergistically enhanced TEHG (SE&#8208;TEHG) is proposed based on the multifunctional amorphous alloy. Following detailed material analyses, Fe72Si8B20 is selected as the synergistic layer for its low surface roughness, high Vickers&#8208;hardness, amorphous structure, and high magnetization. Compared to Al, this material not only boosts TENG's output current and current retention rate by 28.75% and 85.24%, but also improves EMG's output power by 51.05%. In constructing a self&#8208;powered system with TEHG, a significant impedance discrepancy exists between the energy harvester (with matched impendence of 16 M&#937; for TENG and 110 k&#937; for EMG) and the application end. Without power management circuits, the demonstrated self&#8208;powered variable impedance system achieves an energy utilization efficiency that is 2.98 times greater than the conventional constant impedance system. The integration of multifunctional materials to realize strong&#8208;coupling hybrid generators, combined with the customization of variable impedance systems, set a milestone in efficient mechanical energy harvesting and utilization.

         <title>Mesoporous Acridinium&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Framework for Long&#8208;lived Charge&#8208;Separated Exciton Mediated Photocatalytic [4+2] Annulation</title>

         <dc:description>
An Acridinium&#8208;based covalent organic framework (COFs) featuring systematic trap states is designed to generate charge&#8208;separated excitons with enhanced lifetime. Large 4&#160;nm&#8208;sized mesoporous channels and ultra&#8208;stable excitons resulted in the COF functioning as an efficient heterogeneous photocatalyst toward Diels&#8208;Alder type oxidative [4+2] annulation with a million times enhanced interfacial charge dissipation response.








Abstract
Readily tuneable porosity and redox properties of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) result in highly customizable photocatalysts featuring extended electronic delocalization. However, fast charge recombination in COFs severely limits their photocatalytic activities. Herein a new mode of COF photocatalyst design strategy to introduce systematic trap states is programmed, which aids the formation and stabilization of long&#8208;lived charge&#8208;separated excitons. Installing cationic acridinium functionality in a pristine electron&#8208;rich triphenylamine COF via postsynthetic modification resulted in a semiconducting photocatalytic donor&#8211;acceptor dyad network that performed rapid and efficient oxidative Diels&#8208;Alder type [4+2] annulation of styrenes and alkynes to fused aromatic compounds under the atmospheric condition in good to excellent yields. Large mesopores of &#8776;4&#160;nm diameter ensured efficient mass flow within the COF channel. It is confirmed that the catalytic performance of COF originates from the ultra&#8208;stable charge&#8208;separated excitons of 1.9&#160;nm diameter with no apparent radiative charge&#8208;recombination pathway, endorsing almost a million times better photo&#8208;response and catalysis than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Doped Facet&#8208;Selective Copper Nanowires for Activating CO&#8208;to&#8208;Ethanol Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research reports a nickel&#8208;doped copper nanowire catalyst for highly selective ethanol production from CO electroreduction. The theoretical calculations and operando spectroelectrochemical investigations cooperatively demonstrate that nickel&#8208;doping onto copper surface can regulate the interfacial water structure and water dissociation kinetics, which significantly influences the hydrogenation kinetics of a key C2 intermediate (*CHCOH), and thus leading to a high selectivity switch from ethylene to ethanol.








Abstract
Ethanol isa promising energy vector for closing the anthropogenic carbon cycle through reversible electrochemical redox. Currently, ethanol electrosynthesissuffers from low product selectivity due to the competitive advantage of ethylene in CO2/CO electroreduction. Here, a facet&#8208;selective metal&#8208;doping strategy is reported, tuning the reaction kinetics of CO reduction paths and thus enhancing the ethanol selectivity. The theoretical calculations reveal that nickel (Ni)doped Cu(100) surface facilitates water dissociation to form adsorbed hydrogen, which promotesselective electrochemical hydrogenation of a key C2 intermediate (*CHCOH) toward ethanol path over ethylene path. Experimentally, a solution&#8208;phase synthesis of a Ni&#8208;doped {100}&#8208;dominated Copper nanowires (Cu NWs) catalyst is reported, enabling an ethanol Faradaic efficiency of 56% and a selectivity ratio of ethanol to ethylene of 2.7, which are &#8776;4 and 15 times larger than those of undoped Cu NWs, respectively. The operando spectroscopic characterizations&#160;confirm that Ni&#8208;doping in Cu NWs can alter the interfacial water activity and thus regulate the C2 product selectivity.

     alt="Nickel-Doped Facet-Selective Copper Nanowires for Activating CO-to-Ethanol Electrosynthesis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research reports a nickel-doped copper nanowire catalyst for highly selective ethanol production from CO electroreduction. The theoretical calculations and operando spectroelectrochemical investigations cooperatively demonstrate that nickel-doping onto copper surface can regulate the interfacial water structure and water dissociation kinetics, which significantly influences the hydrogenation kinetics of a key C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; intermediate (&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;CHCOH), and thus leading to a high selectivity switch from ethylene to ethanol.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethanol isa promising energy vector for closing the anthropogenic carbon cycle through reversible electrochemical redox. Currently, ethanol electrosynthesissuffers from low product selectivity due to the competitive advantage of ethylene in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO electroreduction. Here, a facet-selective metal-doping strategy is reported, tuning the reaction kinetics of CO reduction paths and thus enhancing the ethanol selectivity. The theoretical calculations reveal that nickel (Ni)doped Cu(100) surface facilitates water dissociation to form adsorbed hydrogen, which promotesselective electrochemical hydrogenation of a key C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; intermediate (&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;CHCOH) toward ethanol path over ethylene path. Experimentally, a solution-phase synthesis of a Ni-doped {100}-dominated Copper nanowires (Cu NWs) catalyst is reported, enabling an ethanol Faradaic efficiency of 56% and a selectivity ratio of ethanol to ethylene of 2.7, which are &#8776;4 and 15 times larger than those of undoped Cu NWs, respectively. The operando spectroscopic characterizations&#160;confirm that Ni-doping in Cu NWs can alter the interfacial water activity and thus regulate the C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; product selectivity. With further electrode engineering, a membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer using Ni-doped Cu NWs catalysts demonstrates an ethanol Faradaic efficiency over 50% at 300&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with a full cell voltage of &#8776;2.7&#160;V and operates stably for over 300 h.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Piezoelectric Heterojunctions as Bacteria&#8208;Killing Bone&#8208;Regenerative Implants</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
TiO2/Bi2WO6 piezoelectric heterojunctions with engineered oxygen vacancies, interfacial built&#8208;in electric fields and piezoelectric properties are constructed as bone implants. The heterojunctions achieve highly efficient and dynamic antimicrobial functions through near infrared (NIR)&#8208;triggered photothermal and photodynamic therapies. Meanwhile, the mechanical forces of the stem cells grown on the implants trigger the heterojunctions to produce electric fields in situ, significantly promoting osteogenesis.








Abstract
Heterojunctions are widely used in energy conversion, environmental remediation, and photodetection, but have not been fully explored in regenerative medicine. In particular, piezoelectric heterojunctions have never been examined in tissue regeneration. Here the development of piezoelectric heterojunctions is shown to promote bone regeneration while eradicating pathogenic bacteria through light&#8208;cellular force&#8208;electric coupling. Specifically, an array of heterojunctions (TiO2/Bi2WO6), made of piezoelectric nanocrystals (Bi2WO6) decorating TiO2 nanowires, is fabricated as a biocompatible implant. Upon exposure to near&#8208;infrared light, the piezoelectric heterojunctions generate reactive oxygen species and heat to kill bacteria through photodynamic and photothermal therapy, respectively. Meanwhile, the mechanical forces of the stem cells grown on the implant trigger the heterojunctions to produce electric fields that further promote osteogenesis to achieve osteointegration. The heterojunctions effectively suppress postoperative recurrent infections while promoting osseointegration through the local electric fields induced by cells. Therefore, the piezoelectric heterojunctions represent a promising antibacterial tissue&#8208;regenerative implant.

         <title>Opto&#8208;Electrical Decoupled Phototransistor for Starlight Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study develops a heterojunction&#8208;gated field&#8208;effect transistor (HGFET) based on an opto&#8208;electric decoupling mechanism, designed to suppress noise and enhance sensitivity, enabling starlight detection. The infrared HGFET detector demonstrates a detectivity exceeding 1014 Jones at 1300 nm, with a detectable radiation intensity as low as 0.46 nW&#160;cm&#8722;2 and a maximum speed in tens of microseconds, showing great potential for high&#8208;resolution, cost&#8208;effective passive night vision imaging sensors.








Abstract
Highly sensitive shortwave infrared (SWIR) detectors are essential for detecting weak radiation (typically below 10&#8722;8 W&#183;Sr&#8722;1&#183;cm&#8722;2&#183;&#181;m&#8722;1) with high&#8208;end passive image sensors. However, mainstream SWIR detection based on epitaxial photodiodes cannot effectively detect ultraweak infrared radiation due to the lack of inherent gain. Here, we develop a heterojunction&#8208;gated field&#8208;effect transistor (HGFET) consisting of a colloidal quantum dot (CQD)&#8208;based p&#8208;i&#8208;n heterojunction and a carbon nanotube (CNT) field&#8208;effect transistor, which achieves a high inherent gain based on an opto&#8208;electric decoupling mechanism for suppressing noise. The stacked heterojunction absorbs infrared radiation and separates electron&#8211;hole pairs. Then, the generated photovoltage tunes the drain current of the CNT FET through an Y2O3 gate insulator. As a result, the HGFET significantly detects and amplifies SWIR signals with a high inherent gain while minimally amplifying noise, leading to a recorded specific detectivity above 1014&#8201;Jones at 1300&#160;nm and a recorded maximum gain&#8208;bandwidth product of 69.2 THz. Direct comparative testing indicates that the HGFET can detect weak infrared radiation at 0.46 nW&#160;cm&#8722;2 levels; thus, compared to commercial and reported SWIR detectors, this detector is much more sensitive and enables starlight detection or vision. As the fabrication process is very compatible with CMOS readout integrated circuits, the HGFET is a promising SWIR detector for realizing passive night vision imaging sensors with high resolutions that are high&#8208;end, highly sensitive, and inexpensive.

         <title>Balanced Miscibility and Crystallinity by 2D Acceptors Enabled Halogen&#8208;Free Solvent&#8208;Processed Organic Solar Cells to Achieve 19.28% Efficiency</title>

Linear and branch side chains on chemical structures lead to the unique crystal structures of the elliptical and rectangular frameworks, respectively. The difference in intermolecular interaction significantly impacts the self&#8208;aggregation tendency and compatibility with a guest acceptor. It found that excessive crystallinity with great self&#8208;aggregation negatively affected molecular packing, while a moderate crystalline collaborated well with the guest acceptor and achieved a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art efficiency of 19.28% based on scalable and stable halogen&#8208;free solvent&#8208;processed organic solar cells.








Abstract
Two highly crystalline 2D acceptors, ATIC&#8208;C11 and ATIC&#8208;BO, with acenaphthene&#8208;expanded quinoxaline central cores, have been demonstrated with very different characteristics in ternary organic solar cells (OSCs). The difference in side chains induces their distinctive molecular packing mode and unique crystal structure, in which ATIC&#8208;C11 displays a 3D structure with an elliptical framework, and ATIC&#8208;BO gives a rectangular framework. Their high crystallinity contributes to organized molecular packing in ternary devices, thus low energetic disorder and suppressed energy loss. Through the analysis of morphology and carrier kinetics, it is found that ATIC&#8208;BO's strong self&#8208;aggregation and immiscibility induce large aggregates and severely impede charge transfer (CT) and dissociation. Conversely, ATIC&#8208;C11's suitable crystallinity and compatibility positively regulate the crystalline kinetics during film formation, thus forming much&#8208;ordered molecular packing and favorable phase separation size in blend films. As a result, ATIC&#8208;C11&#8208;based ternary devices achieve a high efficiency of 19.28% with potential in scalability and stability, which is the top&#8208;ranking efficiency among nonhalogenated solvent&#8208;processed OSCs. This work not only displays highly efficient and stable halogen&#8208;free solvent&#8208;processed organic photovoltaics (OPVs), but also offers a new thought for material design and selection rule on the third component in highly efficient ternary OSCs.

         <title>Fabrication of Ultrathin Ferroelectric Al0.7Sc0.3N Films under Complementary&#8208;Metal&#8208;Oxide&#8208;Semiconductor Compatible Conditions by using HfN0.4 Electrode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aluminum scandium nitride (AlScN), an innovative material for ferroelectric memory applications, is scaled down to an ultra&#8208;thin thickness of 3 nm while maintaining compatibility with complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor fabrication standards, marking a notable breakthrough in the field. Moreover, reducing the operating voltage to 4.35 V represents a significant milestone in advancing low&#8208;voltage AlScN&#8208;based devices.








Abstract
Aluminum scandium nitride (AlScN) has emerged as a promising candidate for next&#8208;generation ferroelectric memories, offering a much higher remanent charge density than other materials with a stable ferroelectric phase. However, the inherently high coercive field requires a substantial decrease in film thickness to lower the operating voltage. Significant leakage currents present a severe challenge during the thickness scaling, especially when maintaining compatibility with complementary&#8208;metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (CMOS) fabrication standards. This study adopts a HfN0.4 bottom electrode, which minimizes lattice mismatch with Al0.7Sc0.3N (ASN), forming a coherent bottom interface that effectively reduces leakage currents even at thickness &lt;&#160;5&#160;nm.

&lt;p&gt;Aluminum scandium nitride (AlScN), an innovative material for ferroelectric memory applications, is scaled down to an ultra-thin thickness of 3 nm while maintaining compatibility with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor fabrication standards, marking a notable breakthrough in the field. Moreover, reducing the operating voltage to 4.35 V represents a significant milestone in advancing low-voltage AlScN-based devices.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aluminum scandium nitride (AlScN) has emerged as a promising candidate for next-generation ferroelectric memories, offering a much higher remanent charge density than other materials with a stable ferroelectric phase. However, the inherently high coercive field requires a substantial decrease in film thickness to lower the operating voltage. Significant leakage currents present a severe challenge during the thickness scaling, especially when maintaining compatibility with complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) fabrication standards. This study adopts a HfN&lt;sub&gt;0.4&lt;/sub&gt; bottom electrode, which minimizes lattice mismatch with Al&lt;sub&gt;0.7&lt;/sub&gt;Sc&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;N (ASN), forming a coherent bottom interface that effectively reduces leakage currents even at thickness &amp;lt;&#160;5&#160;nm. CMOS-compatible HfN&lt;sub&gt;0.4&lt;/sub&gt;/ASN/TiN stack, deposited without vacuum break between each layer, demonstrates exceptional scalability, confirming the ferroelectricity of ASN films at thicknesses down to 3&#160;nm. The coercive voltage is decreased to 4.35&#160;V, significantly advancing low-voltage AlScN devices that align with CMOS standards.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synergistic Modulation of Orientation and Steric Hindrance Induced by Alkyl Chain Length in Ammonium Salt Passivator Toward High&#8208;performance Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic ammonium salts with varying alkyl chain lengths are used to passivate perovskite surface defects and optimize energy band alignment. Nonylammonium acetate (NAAc) achieves superior passivation through optimal molecular orientation and minimized steric hindrance, leading to 25.79% PCE in inverted PSCs utilizing vacuum flash technology in ambient conditions.









Abstract
Organic ammonium salts are extensively utilized for passivating surface defects in perovskite films to mitigate trap&#8208;assisted nonradiative recombination. However, the influence of alkyl chain length on the molecular orientation and spatial steric hindrance of ammonium salt remains underexplored, hindering advancements in more effective passivators. Here, a series of organic ammonium salts is reported with varying alkyl chain lengths to passivate surface defects and optimize band alignment. It is revealed that long alkyl chains promote parallel molecular orientation on the perovskite surface, thereby reinforcing interaction with surface defects, whereas excessive chain length introduces steric hindrance, weakening anion&#8208;perovskite interactions. Nonylammonium acetate (NAAc) with optimal chain length achieves the ideal balance between chemical interactions, resulting in superior passivation. Through NAAc passivation, high&#8208;performance inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and modules are achieved, with power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 25.79% (certified 25.12%) and 19.62%, respectively. This marks a record PCE for inverted PSCs utilizing vacuum flash technology in ambient conditions. Additionally, the NAAc&#8208;passivated devices retain 91% of their initial PCE after 1200&#160;h of continuous maximum power point operation. This work offers new insights into the interplay between molecular orientation and steric hindrance, advancing the design of high&#8208;performance PSCs.

         <title>Constructing 3D Crosslinked Macromolecular Networks as a Highly Efficient Interface Layer for Ultra&#8208;Stable Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel 3D macromolecular network consisting of zinc ion&#8208;bonded potato starch (StZ) is constructed as an interface layer for Zn metal anode. The StZ network provides abundant Zn2+ transport channels and facilitates Zn2+ desolvation, enabling dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition while minimizing parasitic reactions. This approach offers an efficient strategy for achieving excellent electrochemical performance in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs) are experiencing rapid development due to their high theoretical capacity, abundant zinc resources, and intrinsic safety. However, the progress of AZIBs is hindered by uncontrollable parasitic reactions and excessive dendrite growth, which compromise the durability and effective utilization of zinc metal anodes. To address these challenges, the study has constructed a 3D crosslinked macromolecular network composed of zinc ion&#8208;bonded potato starch (StZ) as an interface layer on Zn foil (StZ&#8208;Zn) to inhibit hydrogen evolution, regulate Zn2+ flux, and ensure uniform Zn deposition. Density functional theory calculations, molecular dynamics simulations, COMSOL Multiphysics simulations, and in situ Raman spectra demonstrate that the 3D StZ interface layer facilitates Zn2+ desolvation by restructuring the solvation shells. This process reduces the concentration of H2O at the anode, thereby inhibiting the hydrogen evolution reaction. Consequently, Zn2+ transport is more efficient, promoting a homogeneous Zn2+ flux and enabling dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition. As a result, StZ&#8208;Zn||StZ&#8208;Zn symmetric cell delivers a superb lifespan of 4800 h at the current density of 5 mA cm&#8722;2, and the corresponding cumulative capacity is as high as 12000 mAh cm&#8722;2. Notably, StZ&#8208;Zn||NaV3O8&#183;1.5H2O full cell can stably operate for 2500 cycles at 5 A g&#8722;1 with an outstanding capacity retention of 92%.

         <title>Adaptable Hydrogel with Strong Adhesion of Wet Tissue for Long&#8208;Term Protection of Periodontitis Wound</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A prime challenge in hydrogel treatment of periodontitis is short retention. An in situ light&#8208;curing hydrogel is designed to achieve long&#8208;term protection of periodontal wounds. A paste precursor is configured to achieve stayability before curing, and rapid light&#8208;curing achieves strong adhesion between hydrogel and tissue. This design concept provides a promising solution for novel long&#8208;lasting oral medical hydrogel dressings.









Abstract
Periodontitis is a severe gum infection characterized by inflammation of the tissues surrounding the teeth. The disease is challenging to manage due to its exposure to a wet and dynamic oral environment, where conventional hydrogels often suffer from weak adhesion, short residence time, and vulnerability to bacterial invasion. In this study, an innovative hydrogel system based on in situ light curing is proposed. The hydrogel precursor, comprising sodium alginate and a calcium ion network, is designed and adhere to the irregular and smooth surfaces of periodontal tissue before curing. Upon light irradiation, a second network polymerizes rapidly, establishing multiple interactions with the tissue, which enhances adhesion strength. Benefited from this engineering strategy, the hydrogel&#160;exhibits a low swelling rate, effectively mitigating adhesion loss in the moist oral environment. Additionally, the hydrogel demonstrates excellent long&#8208;lasting wet adhesion, maintaining its presence in periodontal tissue over 120 hours. It also serves as an effective physical barrier against bacterial invasion, achieving a blocking efficiency of 99.9%. This novel design concept offers a promising approach for developing advanced medical dressings for periodontitis, providing sustained therapeutic benefits.

         <title>Multifunctional Biocomposite Materials from Chlorella vulgaris Microalgae</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fabrication and post&#8208;processing technique is introduced to achieve uniform, lightweight, biocomposites based on C. vulgaris through extrusion 3Dprinting. The bioink formulation and dehydration process yield materials with mechanical properties and thermal conductivity comparable to traditional polymer and wood&#8208;based composites. This approach can be adapted to using other microalgae for large&#8208;scale production, in response to increasing global material demand.








Abstract
Extrusion 3D&#8208;printing of biopolymers and natural fiber&#8208;based biocomposites enables the fabrication of complex structures, ranging from implants' scaffolds to eco&#8208;friendly structural materials. However, conventional polymer extrusion requires high energy consumption to reduce viscosity, and natural fiber reinforcement often requires harsh chemical treatments to improve adhesion. We address these challenges by introducing a sustainable framework to fabricate natural biocomposites using Chlorella vulgaris microalgae as the matrix. Through bioink optimization and process refinement, we produced lightweight, multifunctional materials with hierarchical architectures. Infrared spectroscopy analysis reveals that hydrogen bonding plays a critical role in the binding and reinforcement of Chlorella cells by hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC). As water content decreases, the hydrogen bonding network evolves from water&#8208;mediated interactions to direct hydrogen bonds between HEC and Chlorella, enhancing the mechanical properties. A controlled dehydration process maintains continuous microalgae morphology, preventing cracking. The resulting biocomposites exhibit a bending stiffness of 1.6 GPa and isotropic heat transfer and thermal conductivity of 0.10 W/mK at room temperature, demonstrating effective thermal insulation. These characteristics make Chlorella biocomposites promising candidates for applications requiring both structural performance and thermal insulation, offering a sustainable alternative to conventional materials in response to growing environmental demands.

A controlled dehydration process maintains continuous microalgae morphology, preventing cracking. The resulting biocomposites exhibit a bending stiffness of 1.6 GPa and isotropic heat transfer and thermal conductivity of 0.10 W/mK at room temperature, demonstrating effective thermal insulation. These characteristics make &lt;i&gt;Chlorella&lt;/i&gt; biocomposites promising candidates for applications requiring both structural performance and thermal insulation, offering a sustainable alternative to conventional materials in response to growing environmental demands.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Graphene Readout Silicon&#8208;Based Microtube Photodetectors for Encrypted Visible Light Communication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wafer&#8208;scale graphene&#8208;readout silicon&#8208;based microtube photodetectors are designed for Mbps&#8208;level visible light communication reception. The device enable effective photodetection and rapid readout, resulting in a 75&#160;ns response time and 6803&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1 responsivity. The photodetector achieves a 140&#176; field of view and dichroic ratio up to 16.09, offering the potential in internet of things and information security.








Abstract
The implementation of an advanced light receiver is imperative for the widespread application of visible light communication. However, the integration of multifunctional and high&#8208;performance visible light receivers is still limited by device structure and system complexity. Herein, a graphene&#8208;readout silicon&#8208;based microtube photodetector is proposed as the receiver for omnidirectional Mbps&#8208;level visible light communication. The integration of graphene&#8208;semiconductor material systems simultaneously ensures the effective absorption of incident light and rapid readout of photogenerated carriers, and the device exhibits an ultrafast response speed of 75&#160;ns and high responsivity of 6803&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1. In addition, the microtube photodetector realizes the omnidirectional light&#8208;trapping and enhanced polarization photodetection. As the receiving end of the visible light communication system, the microtube photodetector achieves a data rate of up to 778&#160;Mbps, a field of view of 140&#176;, and the encrypted visible light communication of polarized light, providing a new possibility for the future development of the internet of things and information security.

         <title>A Pressure&#8208;Sensitive, Repositionable Bioadhesive for Instant, Atraumatic Surgical Application on Internal Organs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
While ubiquitous in everyday life, pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesives (e.g., scotch tape) are limited to dry surfaces. By integrating hydrogels and pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesives, a pressure&#8208;sensitive bioadhesive that adheres to internal organs is fabricated. The unique adhesive properties of pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesives enable the atraumatic interfacing between surgical equipment and internal tissues for tissue stabilization and fault&#8208;tolerant integration of bioelectronics.








Abstract
Pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesives are widely utilized due to their instant and reversible adhesion to various dry substrates. Though offering intuitive and robust attachment of medical devices on skin, currently available clinical pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesives do not attach to internal organs, mainly due to the presence of interfacial water on the tissue surface that acts as a barrier to adhesion. In this work, a pressure&#8208;sensitive, repositionable bioadhesive (PSB) that adheres to internal organs by synergistically combining the characteristic viscoelastic properties of pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesives and the interfacial behavior of hydrogel bioadhesives, is introduced. Composed of a viscoelastic copolymer, the PSB absorbs interfacial water to enable instant adhesion on wet internal organs, such as the heart and lungs, and removal after use without causing any tissue damage. The PSB's capabilities in diverse on&#8208;demand surgical and analytical scenarios including tissue stabilization of soft organs and the integration of bioelectronic devices in rat and porcine models, are demonstrated.

         <title>Photocatalytic Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation of Acetylene to Polymer&#8208;Grade Ethylene with Molecular and Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Cobaloximes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel photocatalytic systems based on homogeneous and heterogeneous cobaloximes are reported. By leveraging their hydrogen atom transfer catalytic activity, exquisitely efficient and selective acetylene photocatalytic semi&#8208;hydrogenation is reported. Integrating the cobaloximes in a metal&#8211;organic framework results in more stable and durable catalysis.








Abstract
The semi&#8208;hydrogenation of acetylene in ethylene&#8208;rich gas streams is a high&#8208;priority industrial chemical reaction for producing polymer&#8208;grade ethylene. Traditional thermocatalytic routes for acetylene reduction to ethylene, despite progress, still require high temperatures and high H2 consumption, possess relatively low selectivity, and use a noble metal catalyst. Light&#8208;powered strategies are starting to emerge, given that they have the potential to use directly the abundant and sustainable solar irradiation, but are ineffective. Here an efficient, &gt;99.9% selective, visible&#8208;light powered, catalytic conversion of acetylene to ethylene is reported. The catalyst is a homogeneous molecular cobaloxime that operates in tandem with a photosensitizer at room temperature and bypasses the use of non&#8208;environmentally friendly and flammable H2 gas feed. The reaction proceeds through a cobalt&#8208;hydride intermediate with &#8776;100% conversion of acetylene under competitive (ethylene co&#8208;feed) conditions after only 50 min, and with no evolution of H2 or over&#8208;hydrogenation to ethane. The cobaloxime is further incorporated as a linker in a metal&#8211;organic framework; the result is a heterogeneous catalyst for the conversion of acetylene under competitive (ethylene co&#8208;feed) conditions that can be recycled up to six times and remains catalytically active for 48 h, before significant loss of performance is observed.

         <title>Unlocking Topological Effects in Covalent Organic Frameworks for High&#8208;Performance Photosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three fully conjugated 2D sp2 carbon&#8208;linked COFs with distinct topologies are designed and synthesized for efficient photocatalytic H2O2 production. The topological effects play a crucial role in regulating the charge carrier dynamics in COFs. The hxl topology significantly enhances charge separation and transport, achieving an unprecedented 1.41% efficiency for solar&#8208;driven photocatalytic H2O2 production in COF&#8208;based photocatalysts.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) offer a compelling platform for the efficient photosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Constructed with diverse topologies from various molecular building units, COFs can exhibit unique photocatalytic properties. In this study, three &#960;&#8208;conjugated 2D sp2 carbon&#8208;linked COFs with distinctly different topologies (hcb, sql, and hxl) are designed to investigate the topological effect on the overall photosynthesis of H2O2 from water and oxygen. Despite their similar chemical and band structures, the QP&#8208;HPTP&#8208;COF with hxl topology outperformed other COFs in the photosynthesis of H2O2, demonstrating a remarkable solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency of 1.41%. Comprehensive characterizations confirmed that the hxl topology can substantially improve charge separation and transfer, thereby significantly enhancing photocatalytic performance. This study not only unravels the topology&#8208;directed charge carrier dynamics in COFs but also establishes a molecular engineering framework for developing high&#8208;performance photocatalysts for sustainable H2O2 production.

         <title>Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)&#8208;Inspired Fully Printed Soft Pressure Sensor Array with Self&#8208;Adaptive Pressurization for Highly Reliable Individualized Long&#8208;Term Pulse Diagnostics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by pulse diagnosis methods in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), this work reports a self&#8208;adaptive pressure sensing platform (PSP) that combines the fully printed flexible pressure sensor array with an adaptive wristband&#8208;style pressure system to enable 3D reconstruction of the pulse.








Abstract
Reliable, non&#8208;invasive, continuous monitoring of pulse and blood pressure is essential for the prevention and diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. However, the pulse wave varies drastically among individuals or even over time in the same individual, presenting significant challenges for the existing pulse sensing systems. Inspired by pulse diagnosis methods in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), this work reports a self&#8208;adaptive pressure sensing platform (PSP) that combines the fully printed flexible pressure sensor array with an adaptive wristband&#8208;style pressure system can identify the optimal pulse signal. Besides the detected pulse rate/width/length, &#8220;Cun, Guan, Chi&#8221; position, and &#8220;floating, moderate, sinking&#8221; pulse features, the PSP combined with a machine learning&#8208;based linear regression model can also accurately predict blood pressure such as systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressure values. The developed diagnostic platform is demonstrated for highly reliable long&#8208;term monitoring and analysis of pulse and blood pressure across multiple human subjects over time. The design concept and proof&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;concept demonstrations also pave the way for the future developments of flexible sensing devices/systems for adaptive individualized monitoring in the complex practical environments for personalized medicine, along with the support for the development of digital TCM.

         <title>Standing 1D Chains Enable Efficient Wide&#8208;Bandgap Selenium Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A substrate&#8208;heating strategy is adopted to facilitate the interfacial bonding between Se and substrate, enabling the growth of Se films with a vertical orientation. The resulting Se films exhibit a 4&#8208;times increase in carrier mobility compared to horizontally&#8208;oriented Se films. Solar cells fabricated using these Se films achieve a record efficiency of 8.1%.








Abstract
The recent surge in tandem solar cells and indoor photovoltaics has renewed interest in selenium (Se), the world's first photovoltaic material, due to its intrinsic wide bandgap of &#8776;1.9&#160;eV, high stability, and non&#8208;toxicity in small quantities when applied in photovoltaics. However, with a 1D chained crystal structure, Se tends to grow crystalline films with a lying orientation&#8212;chains parallel to substrates arising from the low surface energy; this results in poor carrier transport across chains held together by weak van der Waals forces. Here a substrate&#8208;heating strategy that facilitates the interfacial bonding between Se and substrate is introduced, enabling the growth of Se films with a standing orientation&#8212;chains perpendicular to substrates. This achieves efficient carrier transport along covalently bonded chains. The resulting Se films thereby exhibit a fourfold increase in carrier mobility compared to lying&#8208;oriented Se films. Consequently, Se solar cells are achieved with the highest power conversion efficiency of 8.1% under AM1.5G 1&#8208;sun illumination. The unencapsulated devices exhibit negligible efficiency loss after 1&#160;000 h of storage under ambient conditions.

         <title>Transcytosable and Ultrasound&#8208;Activated Liposome Enables Deep Penetration of Biofilm for Surgical Site Infection Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vascular&#8208;cell&#8208;adhesion&#8208;molecule&#8208;1 (VCAM1)&#8208;targeted and ultrasound&#8208;activated liposome (ligand&#8208;modified, perfluoropentane&#8208;encapsulated, and dual Ce6 and OTM&#8208;integrated liposome) is capable of overcoming the biological barriers of vascular endothelial cells and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in biofilm&#8208;associated surgical site infection. VCAM1&#8208;receptor&#8208;mediated transcytosis and ultrasonic&#8208;cavitation&#8208;induced EPS collapse consecutively achieve efficient drug accumulation and deep penetration, then lead to potent biofilm eradication.








Abstract
Biofilm&#8208;associated surgical site infection (BSSI) is a common and grievous postoperative complication lacking effective remedies, mainly due to the poor drug accumulation and penetration in the biofilms featured by dense extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs). Here, it is found that the vascular cell adhesion molecule&#8208;1 (VCAM1) is highly overexpressed in the vascular cells of BSSI. It is proposed that the combination of VCAM1&#8208;mediated transcytosis and ultrasonic cavitation can consecutively overcome the biological barriers of vascular endothelial cells and EPS for biofilm eradication. To demonstrate the feasibility, a VCAM1&#8208;targeted and ultrasound (US)&#8208;activated liposome (LPCOTML) loaded with a reactive&#8208;oxygen&#8208;species (ROS)&#8208;responsive lipoid prodrug of oleoyl meropenem, sonosensitizer of lipoid Ce6, and perfluoropentane is developed. LPCOTML can recognize the receptors on vascular cells, and initiate receptor&#8208;mediated transcytosis for transendothelial transport into the BSSI periphery. LPCOTML subsequently transforms from nanoparticle into microbubble via liquid&#8211;gas phase transition under US irradiation, triggering strong ultrasonic cavitation to blow up the EPS and deeply penetrate the biofilms. The sonosensitizer Ce6 induces ROS production under US irradiation and triggers the release of meropenem to induce potent antibacterial effect in a BSSI model. This study presents an effective strategy to tackle the biological barriers in BSSI via combining receptor&#8208;mediated transcytosis and ultrasonic cavitation.

         <title>Deep&#8208;Learning Empowered Customized Chiral Metasurface for Calibration&#8208;Free Biosensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops a deep learning&#8208;driven data iteration strategy alongside a global optimization network, showcasing excellent capabilities in expediting metasurface design and unearthing complex light&#8208;matter interactions. As anticipated, it enables the customized and easy&#8208;to&#8208;implement design of chiral metasurfaces and advanced sensing abilities for enantiomer&#8208;specific analysis of bio&#8208;samples in a calibration&#8208;free manner.








Abstract
As a 2D metamaterial, metasurfaces offer an unprecedented avenue to facilitate light&#8208;matter interactions. The current &#8220;one&#8208;by&#8208;one design&#8221; method is hindered by time&#8208;consuming, repeated testing within a confined space. However, intelligent design strategies for metasurfaces, limited by data&#8208;driven properties, have rarely been explored. To address this gap, a data iterative strategy based on deep learning, coupled with a global optimization network is proposed, to achieve the customized design of chiral metasurfaces. This methodology is applied to precisely identify different chiral molecules in a label&#8208;free manner. Fundamentally different from the traditional approach of collecting data purely through simulation, the proposed data generation strategy encompasses the entire design space, which is inaccessible by conventional methods. The dataset quality is significantly improved, with a 21&#8208;fold increase in the number of chiral structures exhibiting the desired circular dichroism (CD) response (&gt;0.6). The method's efficacy is validated by a monolayer structure that is easily prepared, demonstrating advanced sensing abilities for enantiomer&#8208;specific analysis of bio&#8208;samples. These results demonstrate the superior capability of data&#8208;driven schemes in photonic design and the potential of chiral metasurface&#8208;based platforms for calibration&#8208;free biosensing applications. The proposed approach will accelerate the development of complex systems for rapid molecular detection, spectroscopic imaging, and other applications.

         <title>Air&#8208;Processed Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells With Full Lifecycle Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The two&#8208;step air&#8208;processed efficient PSCs with full lifecycle management are effectively realized by the polymer&#8208;stabilized precursor ink. The modified PSCs deliver an impressive efficiency of 25.18% with superior environmental and mechanical stability. The end&#8208;of&#8208;life PSCs with lead leakage suppression and device regeneration will not pose a threat to the environmental and biological safety.








Abstract
Despite the outstanding power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) realized over the years, the entire lifecycle from preparation and operation to discarding of PSCs still needs to be carefully considered when it faces the upcoming large&#8208;scale production and deployment. In this study, bio&#8208;derived chitin&#8208;based polymers are employed to realize the full lifecycle regulation of air&#8208;processed PSCs by forming multiple coordinated and hydrogen bonds to stabilize the lead iodide and organic salt precursor inks, accelerating the solid&#8211;liquid reaction and crystallization of two&#8208;step deposition process, then achieving the high crystalline and oriented perovskites with less notorious charge defects in the open air.

&lt;p&gt;The two-step air-processed efficient PSCs with full lifecycle management are effectively realized by the polymer-stabilized precursor ink. The modified PSCs deliver an impressive efficiency of 25.18% with superior environmental and mechanical stability. The end-of-life PSCs with lead leakage suppression and device regeneration will not pose a threat to the environmental and biological safety.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the outstanding power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) realized over the years, the entire lifecycle from preparation and operation to discarding of PSCs still needs to be carefully considered when it faces the upcoming large-scale production and deployment. In this study, bio-derived chitin-based polymers are employed to realize the full lifecycle regulation of air-processed PSCs by forming multiple coordinated and hydrogen bonds to stabilize the lead iodide and organic salt precursor inks, accelerating the solid&#8211;liquid reaction and crystallization of two-step deposition process, then achieving the high crystalline and oriented perovskites with less notorious charge defects in the open air. The air-prepared PSCs exhibit a decent efficiency of 25.18% with high preparation reproducibility and improved operational stability toward the harsh environment and mechanical stress stimuli. The modified PSCs display negligible fatigue behavior with keeping 92% of its initial efficiency after operating for 32 diurnal cycles (ISOS-LC-1 protocol). Meanwhile, closed-loop lead management of end-of-life PSCs including suppression of lead leakage, toxicity evaluation of broken devices, and recycling of lead iodide components are comprehensively investigated. This work sheds light on a promising avenue to realize the entire lifecycle regulation of air-processed efficient and stable PSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Plasmonic MoO3&#8208;x significantly lowers the formation energy of sulfur vacancies in ZnIn2S4, resulting in a sulfur&#8208;vacancy&#8208;rich surface within the ZnIn2S4/MoO3&#8208;x photocatalyst. This enhances CO2 adsorption and activation, reduces the energy barrier for HCOO* formation, and promotes efficient *CH3&#8208;CH3 coupling. Consequently, the system achieves a CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H6 conversion rate of 467.3 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with a selectivity of 92.0%.








Abstract
To achieve high selectivity in photocatalytic CO2 reduction to C2+ products, increasing the number of CO2 adsorption sites and lowering the energy barriers for key intermediates are critical. A ZnIn2S4 (ZIS)/MoO3&#8208;x (Z&#8208;M) photocatalyst is presented, in which plasmonic MoO3&#8208;x generates hot electrons, creating a multielectron environment in ZIS that facilitates efficient C&#9472;C coupling reactions. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that MoO3&#8208;x reduces the formation energy of sulfur vacancies (SV) in ZIS, thereby enhancing CO2 adsorption and activation. The SV&#8208;rich surface lowers the energy barrier for forming HCOO* to &#8722;0.33 eV whereas the energy barrier for forming *COOH is 0.77 eV. Successive hydrogenation of HCOO* leads to *CH2, which converts to *CH3 with an energy barrier of &#8722;0.63 eV. The energy barrier for *CH3&#8208;CH3 coupling is 0.54 eV, which is lower than the 0.73 eV for *CH2&#8208;CH2 coupling to form *C2H4. Thus, Z&#8208;M preferentially produces C2H6 over C2H4. Under visible light, Z&#8208;M achieves a CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H6 conversion rate of 467.3 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with 92.0% selectivity. This work highlights the dual role of plasmonic photocatalysts in enhancing CO2 adsorption and improving C2+ production in CO2 reduction.

Tissue Adhesives
Pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesives, such as scotch tape, demonstrate adhesion limited to dry substrates. By integrating the interfacial behavior of hydrogels, Yuhan Lee, Hyunwoo Yuk, Seongjun Park, and co&#8208;workers have synthesized a pressure&#8208;sensitive bioadhesive capable of instant and repositionable adhesion on wet internal organs, such as the lungs. This class of adhesives exhibits potential utility in on&#8208;demand surgical and analytical scenarios, including fault&#8208;tolerant integration of surgical tools and sensors. More details can be found in article number 2407116.

Superhydrophobic Concave Pillar
In article number 2409389, Dong Woog Lee and co&#8208;workers report a stable superhydrophobic surface achieved through a novel concave morphology design. The concave pillar structures enhance resistance to wetting transitions under both impact and hydrostatic pressure. The air trapped in the concavities during water contact plays a crucial role in maintaining stable superhydrophobicity by forming a convex air cap.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Superhydrophobic Concave Pillar&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In article number &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202409389"&gt;2409389&lt;/a&gt;, Dong Woog Lee and co-workers report a stable superhydrophobic surface achieved through a novel concave morphology design. The concave pillar structures enhance resistance to wetting transitions under both impact and hydrostatic pressure. The air trapped in the concavities during water contact plays a crucial role in maintaining stable superhydrophobicity by forming a convex air cap.

Polyhexahydrotriazine Aerogels
In article number 2412502 by &#381;eljko Tomovi&#263; and co&#8208;workers, a simple one&#8208;step synthesis of closed&#8208;loop recyclable polyhexahydrotriazine (PHT) aerogels is presented, which are made from commercially available aromatic amines and paraformaldehyde. These PHT aerogels display thermal superinsulation, pronounced thermal stability, great mechanical performance, and intrinsic hydrophobicity. Furthermore, PHT aerogels can be depolymerized under acidic aqueous conditions, allowing the monomers to be reused to prepare fresh aerogels.

Piezoelectric Heterojunctions
Heterojunctions, made of piezoelectric nanocrystals and nanowires, can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and heat to kill bacteria under the irradiation of near&#8208;infrared light. These heterojunctions produce electric signals under the forces applied by the stem cells grown on them and such electric signals further promote bone formation. Hence, they can not only achieve osteointegration but also eradicate implant&#8208;associated infections. More details can be found in article number 2413171 by Chengyun Ning, Peng Yu, Chuanbin Mao, and co&#8208;workers.

         <title>The Development, Essence and Perspective of Nitrogen Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper summarizes the development of six milestones of nitrogen reduction to ammonia, and concludes its commonalities and characteristics. Accordingly, the essence of ammonia synthesis is extracted, that is the reaction pathways are influenced by the energy barrier of reaction intrmediates, which can be altered by proton sources, auxiliaries and catalysts, providing design guidance for efficient ammonia synthesis.








Abstract
Ammonia plays a pivotal role in agriculture and meanwhile holds promising potential as an energy vector for the hydrogen economy, where the nitrogen reduction to ammonia is a critical pathway for achieving sustainable development. Over the past hundred years, ammonia synthesis has undergone several breakthrough developments from Haber&#8208;Bosch process to photo/electro&#8208;catalysis and Li&#8208;mediated strategy, but still faces the challenges of low yield rate, selectivity and efficiency. Therefore, there is a pressing demand to develop efficient and green ammonia synthesis from nitrogen. This review summarizes the development of the nitrogen reduction to ammonia, highlighting six milestones during the whole journey. From the development direction, this work finds and extracts the essence of ammonia synthesis, that is the reaction pathways are affected by the energy barrier of reaction intermediates, which can be altered by proton sources, auxiliaries and catalysts. Then this work discusses the detailed overview of the significant development of proton source, auxiliaries and catalysts. Finally, based on the essence, the possible opportunities of ammonia synthesis from nitrogen reduction are presented, including the design of new ammonia synthesis pathways and efficient catalysts. The deep insight of nitrogen reduction to ammonia will provide a design guidance for efficient ammonia synthesis.

         <title>Catalytic Biomaterials&#8208;Activated In Situ Chemical Reactions: Strategic Modulation and Enhanced Disease Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review delves into the modulation of fundamental catalytic reactions, a cornerstone in addressing disease treatment through an interdisciplinary lens. Central to this review's discussion is the regulation of chemical reactions while concurrently accounting for the complex microenvironments of diseases to achieve specificity, efficiency, and control of in situ chemical reactions. It seeks to clarify the mechanisms underpinning catalytic biomaterials activated in situ chemical reactions and evaluate their potential to revolutionize treatment strategies across various pathological conditions.








Abstract
Chemical reactions underpin biological processes, and imbalances in critical biochemical pathways within organisms can lead to the onset of severe diseases. Within this context, the emerging field of &#8220;Nanocatalytic Medicine&#8221; leverages nanomaterials as catalysts to modulate fundamental chemical reactions specific to the microenvironments of diseases. This approach is designed to facilitate the targeted synthesis and localized accumulation of therapeutic agents, thus enhancing treatment efficacy and precision while simultaneously reducing systemic side effects. The effectiveness of these nanocatalytic strategies critically hinges on a profound understanding of chemical kinetics and the intricate interplay of reactions within particular pathological microenvironments to ensure targeted and effective catalytic actions. This review methodically explores in situ catalytic reactions and their associated biomaterials, emphasizing regulatory strategies that control therapeutic responses. Furthermore, the discussion encapsulates the crucial elements&#8208;reactants, catalysts, and reaction conditions/environments&#8208;necessary for optimizing the thermodynamics and kinetics of these reactions, while rigorously addressing both the biochemical and biophysical dimensions of the disease microenvironments to enhance therapeutic outcomes. It seeks to clarify the mechanisms underpinning catalytic biomaterials and evaluate their potential to revolutionize treatment strategies across various pathological conditions.

         <title>Synthesis Strategies for High Entropy Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review critically assesses the various synthesis strategies developed for high entropy materials nanoparticles preparation, highlighting key illustrative examples and offering insights into the underlying formation mechanisms.








Abstract
Nanoparticles (NPs) of high entropy materials (HEMs) have attracted significant attention due to their versatility and wide range of applications. HEM NPs can be synthesized by fragmenting bulk HEMs or disintegrating and recrystallizing them. Alternatively, directly producing HEMs in NP form from atomic/ionic/molecular precursors presents a significant challenge. A widely adopted strategy involves thermodynamically driving HEM NP formation by leveraging the entropic contribution but incorporating strategies to limit NP growth at the elevated temperatures used for maximizing entropy. A second approach is to kinetically drive HEM NP formation by promoting rapid reactions of homogeneous reactant mixtures or using highly diluted precursor dissolutions. Additionally, experimental evidence suggests that enthalpy plays a significant role in driving HEM NP formation processes at moderate temperatures, with the high energy cost of generating additional surfaces and interfaces at the nanoscale stabilizing the HEM phase. This review critically assesses the various synthesis strategies developed for HEM NP preparation, highlighting key illustrative examples and offering insights into the underlying formation mechanisms. Such insights are critical for fine&#8208;tuning experimental conditions to achieve specific outcomes, ultimately enabling the effective synthesis of optimized generations of these advanced materials for both current and emerging applications across various scientific and technological fields.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functionalized quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes with electronegative atoms (O/N/F)&#8208;containing functional groups facilitate the optimization of the electron distribution around them, which endows the facile optimization of the interaction strength between the positively charged and negatively charged species, leading to desired thermal and kinetical optimal states, and thus benefiting the stabilization of the Zn anode for potential flexible devices.








Abstract
The rapid development of wearable and intelligent flexible devices has posed strict requirements for power sources, including excellent mechanical strength, inherent safety, high energy density, and eco&#8208;friendliness. Zn&#8208;ion batteries with aqueous quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes (AQSSEs) with various functional groups that contain electronegative atoms (O/N/F) with tunable electron accumulation states are considered as a promising candidate to power the flexible devices and tremendous progress has been achieved in this prospering area. Herein, this review proposes a comprehensive summary of the recent achievements using the AQSSE in flexible devices by focusing on the significance of different functional groups. The fundamentals and challenges of the ZIBs are introduced from a chemical view in the first place. Then, the mechanism behind the stabilization of the flexible ZIBs with the functionalized AQSSE is summarized and explained in detail. Then the recent progress regarding the enhanced electrochemical stability of the ZIBs with the AQSSE is summarized and classified based on the functional groups on the polymer chain. The advanced characterization methods for the AQSSE are briefly introduced in the following sections. Last but not least, current challenges and future perspectives for this promising area are provided from the authors' point of view.

This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advances in design strategies for synthesizing solution&#8208;processable metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and MOF&#8208;based systems, including methods such as direct dispersion in ionic liquids, direct synthesis, etc. It emphasizes their applications in fabricating structured objects, membranes, and/or films for molecular storage, separation, and chemical sensing. The review also discusses future challenges and perspectives. 








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), constructed by inorganic secondary building units with organic linkers via reticular chemistry, inherently suffer from poor solution processability due to their insoluble nature, resulting from their extensive crystalline networks and structural rigidity. The ubiquitous occurrence of precipitation and agglomeration of MOFs upon formation poses a significant obstacle to the scale&#8208;up production of MOF&#8208;based monolith, aerogels, membranes, and electronic devices, thus restricting their practical applications in various scenarios. To address the previously mentioned challenge, significant strides have been achieved over the past decade in the development of various strategies aimed at preparing solution&#8208;processable MOF systems. In this review, the latest advance in the synthetic strategies for the construction of solution&#8208;processable MOFs, including direct dispersion in ionic liquids, surface modification, controllable calcination, and bottom&#8208;up synthesis, is comprehensively summarized. The respective advantages and disadvantages of each method are discussed. Additionally, the intriguing applications of solution&#8208;processable MOF systems in the fields of liquid adsorbent, molecular capture, sensing, and separation are systematically discussed. Finally, the challenges and opportunities about the continued advancement of solution&#8208;processable MOFs and their potential applications are outlooked.

This review demonstrates the properties of HEMs both qualitatively and quantitatively, and the mechanisms of their enhancement on battery properties. It also illustrates the progress in high&#8208;entropy layered oxide cathode materials (HELOs) for lithium/sodium/potassium ion batteries (LIBs/SIBs/PIBs) in the perspectives of synthesis, characterization and application, and elucidating the synthesis&#8208;structure&#8208;property relationship.








Abstract
Increasing demand for rechargeable batteries necessitates improvements in electrochemical performance. Traditional optimal approaches such as elemental doping and surface modification are insufficient for practical applications of the batteries. High&#8208;entropy materials (HEMs) possess stable solid&#8208;state phases and unparalleled flexibility in composition and electronic structure, which facilitate rapid advancements in battery materials. This review demonstrates the properties of HEMs both qualitatively and quantitatively, and the mechanisms of their enhancement on battery properties. It also illustrates the progress in high&#8208;entropy layered oxide cathode materials (HELOs) for lithium/sodium/potassium ion batteries (LIBs/SIBs/PIBs) in the perspectives of synthesis, characterization and application, and elucidating the synthesis&#8208;structure&#8208;property relationship. Furthermore, it outlines future directions for high&#8208;entropy strategies in battery study: precise synthesis control, understanding of reaction mechanisms through structural characterization, elucidation of structure&#8208;performance correlations, and the computational and experimental methods integration for rapid screening and analysis of HEMs. The perspective aims to inspire researchers in the development of high&#8208;performance rechargeable batteries.

         <title>Polarization: A Universal Driving Force for Energy, Environment, and Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polarization techniques are revolutionizing material functionalities across energy, environmental, and electronic sectors. This review comprehensively examines polarization mechanisms such as piezoelectric, ferroelectric, and pyroelectric effects, alongside strategies like doping and heterostructures. It highlights its pivotal role in enhancing charge dynamics, modifying surface chemistries, and facilitating energy&#8208;efficient designs in various applications.








Abstract
The sustainable future relies on the synergistic development of energy, environmental, and electronic systems, founded on the development of functional materials by exploring their quantum mechanisms. Effective control over the distribution and behavior of charges within these materials, a basic quantum attribute, is crucial in dictating their physical, chemical, and electronic properties. At the core of charge manipulation lies &#8220;polarization&#8221;&#8212;a ubiquitous phenomenon marked by separating positive and negative charges. This review thoroughly examines polarization techniques, spotlighting their transformative role in catalysis, energy storage, solar cells, and electronics. Starting with the foundational mechanisms underlying various forms of polarization, including piezoelectric, ferroelectric, and pyroelectric effects, the perspective is expanded to cover any asymmetric phenomena that generate internal fields, such as heterostructures and doping. Afterward, the critical role of polarization across various applications, including charge separation, surface chemistry modification, and energy band alignment, is highlighted. Special emphasis is placed on the synergy between polarization and material properties, demonstrating how this interplay is pivotal in overcoming existing technological limitations and unlocking new functionalities. Through a comprehensive analysis, a holistic roadmap is offered for harnessing polarization across the broad spectrum of applications, thus finding sustainable solutions for future energy, environment, and electronics.

         <title>Recent Advances in High&#8208;Entropy Layered Oxide Cathode Materials for Alkali Metal&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>

The basic concepts, design principles, synthetic methods, advanced characterization, and theoretical calculations of high&#8208;entropy layered oxides are summarized here for alkali metal&#8208;ion battery (AMIB) cathodes. It highlights the recent advances in high&#8208;entropy strategies for improving the electrochemical performance of layered oxide cathodes, and existing problems and possible solutions, providing guidance for the development of layered oxides for highly efficient AMIB cathodes.








Abstract
Since the electrochemical de/intercalation behavior is first detected in 1980, layered oxides have become the most promising cathode material for alkali metal&#8208;ion batteries (Li+/Na+/K+; AMIBs) owing to their facile synthesis and excellent theoretical capacities. However, the inherent drawbacks of unstable structural evolution and sluggish diffusion kinetics deteriorate their electrochemical performance, limiting further large&#8208;scale applications. To solve these issues, the novel and promising strategy of high entropy has been widely applied to layered oxide cathodes for AMIBs in recent years. Through multielement synergy and entropy stabilization effects, high&#8208;entropy layered oxides (HELOs) can achieve adjustable activity and enhanced stability. Herein, the basic concepts, design principles, and synthesis methods of HELO cathodes are introduced systematically. Notably, it explores in detail the improvements of the high&#8208;entropy strategy on the limitations of layered oxides, highlighting the latest advances in high&#8208;entropy layered cathode materials in the field of AMIBs. In addition, it introduces advanced characterization and theoretical calculations for HELOs and proposes potential future research directions and optimization strategies, providing inspiration for researchers to develop advanced HELO cathode materials in the areas of energy storage and conversion.
