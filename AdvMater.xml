         <title>La&#8208;Doped Mullite Bi2Fe4O9 Chemiresistive Gas Sensor for Ultra&#8208;Highly Selective Detection of Ethylene Glycol</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
La&#8208;doped mullite Bi2Fe4O9 with abundant oxygen vacancies was facilely synthesized, affording exceptional selectivity to ethylene glycol (EG) vapor. The surface oxidation mechanism of EG on La&#8208;doped Bi2Fe4O9 was elucidated, and a wearable sensing platform was developed, with machine learning enhancing gas recognition accuracy.








ABSTRACT
The detection of ethylene glycol (EG) vapor is critical for industrial safety and environmental monitoring, yet existing chemiresistive sensors suffer from limited selectivity and stability. Herein, a facile synthesis of lanthanum&#8208;doped mullite bismuth ferrite mullite (La&#8208;Bi2Fe4O9) is presented. Atomic&#8208;resolution imaging and microchemical analysis, in combination with theoretical calculations, confirm uniform Bi&#8208;site doping, increased&#160;oxygen vacancy concentration, and enhanced gas adsorption. The optimized BLFO&#8208;5 sensor demonstrates exceptional EG&#8208;sensing performance,&#160;with&#160;ultrahigh selectivity, outstanding reproducibility and long&#8208;term stability, and an ultralow detection limit. By integrating in situ infrared spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we elucidate the EG surface oxidization reaction mechanism, revealing significantly enhanced dehydrogenation kinetics and a complete oxidation pathway. Moreover, we develop a wearable real&#8208;time gas monitoring platform for practical validation and incorporate deep learning algorithms to improve gas recognition accuracy. This work presents an integrated strategy for chemical gas sensing that combines material defect engineering, mechanistic understanding, and functional device development, enabling wireless EG quantification in complex environments.

         <title>Suppressing Electric&#8208;Field&#8208;Induced Cathodic Salt Crystallization for Stable Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our work unveils an overlooked failure mechanism in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries: electric&#8208;field&#8208;induced catastrophic interfacial salt crystallization (CISC). We effectively suppress CISC by introducing sulfolane to disrupt interfacial ion ordering and raise the crystallization barrier. This molecular&#8208;level electrolyte design enables exceptional long&#8208;life performance, achieving 20&#160;000 stable cycles at &#8211;20&#160;&#176;C with negligible capacity decay.








ABSTRACT
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) hold promise for sustainable energy storage but suffer rapid capacity decay, particularly at subzero conditions. Beyond cathode instability and side reactions, we unveil an interfacial failure pathway: electric&#8208;field&#8208;induced phase separation that triggers catastrophic interfacial salt crystallization (CISC). The insulating crystalline layer rapidly engulfs the cathode, precipitating accelerated degradation. Mechanistic studies pinpoint solvent depletion and anion enrichment within the electric double layer as the origin of CISC. Molecular dynamics simulations and experimental observations demonstrate that sulfolane (TS) disrupts interfacial ion ordering, elevates the crystallization barrier, and thereby effectively suppresses CICS. This strategy stabilizes the cathode structure, enhances zinc availability, facilitates the V2O5 activation phase transition, increases the Zn2+ transference number, and promotes uniform Zn2+ deposition. Consequently, V2O5||Zn batteries display remarkable stability, retaining 378.9&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 after 300 cycles at room temperature and sustaining nearly invariant capacity over 20&#160;000 cycles at &#8722;20&#176;C. These findings expose interfacial salt crystallization as a critical failure pathway in AZIBs and provide a molecular&#8208;level design strategy for electrolyte engineering.

         <title>Personal Thermoregulation by Heat&#8208;Conducting Engineered Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article covers personal thermal management textiles. It begins with mechanistic models for predicting thermal conductivity of composites, reviews advance in single&#8208;function (warming/cooling) and bifunctional (switchable) textile design, analyzes key scientific challenges for practical application, and concludes with an outlook on future developments and emerging applications of personal thermal management technology.








ABSTRACT
Personal thermal management (PTM) is a technique leveraging advanced textile design to control the heat exchange between the human body and the external environment, thereby regulating microenvironments surrounding individuals and ensuring optimal thermal comfort. Critical to the PTM is heat conductivity, which serves as the primary mode of thermal transfer in textiles. Various materials with engineered thermal conductivities have been developed and incorporated into textiles for modulating warming and cooling effects toward achieving the optimal thermal comfort. However, the performance of reported textiles remains far from being satisfactory to meet the needs of daily use, especially in terms of heat management, wearability, and operational stability. Here, we first introduce mechanistic models for predicting the textiles&#8217; thermal conductivity. Then, we provide a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in the design and realization of both single&#8208;function textiles (warming or cooling) and bifunctional textiles (switchable warming and cooling) based on mechanical force and various stimuli&#8208;responsive materials. We also analyze the major scientific and technological challenges for materializing the potential of textiles into practical applications in the PTM. Finally, an outlook is made on the future developments of the heat&#8208;conducting textiles and on the emerging applications of PTM technology.

         <title>In Situ Polymerized Polysiloxane Enables Cohesive Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase for Practical Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cohesion solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) is proposed to enhance SEI mechanical stability. In situ formed polysiloxane glues the inorganic nanoparticles of SEI. This glued SEI has an elastic modulus 2.1 times as high as that of the routine SEI. Li&#8208;metal pouch cell with glued SEI exhibits both high energy density and high discharge power density.








ABSTRACT
The mechanical instability of nanostructured solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) on lithium (Li)&#8208;metal anodes severely limits the cycle life of Li&#8208;metal batteries because SEI undergoes endless cracking and regeneration due to anode volume fluctuations. Here, a cohesive SEI nanostructure is proposed to enhance SEI mechanical stability. The inorganic nanoparticles with weak interparticle cohesion in SEI are glued using polysiloxane, in situ formed from hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane (CTS) as an electrolyte additive. This approach strengthens interparticle cohesion of inorganic components, and the elastic modulus of SEI increases by 109%, significantly improving its tolerance to anode volume fluctuations. As a result, Li&#8208;metal coin cells with glued SEI exhibit an extended cycle life of 320 cycles, compared with 183 cycles with routine SEI, under practical conditions. Furthermore, a prototype 505&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 Li&#8208;metal pouch cell with glued SEI achieves 175 cycles. Specifically, the pouch cell with glued SEI exhibits superior high&#8208;rate discharge capabilities, as demonstrated by its capacity to power a micro&#8208;unmanned aerial vehicle, advancing Li&#8208;metal batteries towards practical applications. This work presents a generalizable strategy to in situ reinforcement of SEI for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li&#8208;metal batteries.

         <title>Tailorable Polarity Switching and Optoelectronic Transition in a Gate&#8208;Source Integrated 2D Ferroelectric Phototransistor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a gate&#8208;source integrated ferroelectric phototransistor in which the gate electrode is merged with the source electrode. This design ensures effective gate modulation of the carrier&#8208;transport characteristics while applying a channel voltage, thus facilitating the integration and multifunctionality of the devices.









ABSTRACT
2D ferroelectric phototransistors are innovative devices capable of regulating the optoelectronic characteristics of channel materials through ferroelectric polarization, demonstrating immense potential in photodetection, optical storage, and optical communication. Herein, we present a novel 2D ferroelectric phototransistor structure&#8212;Au/WSe2/CuCrP2S6/graphene&#8212;featuring an integrated gate&#8211;source electrode.

&lt;p&gt;We propose a gate-source integrated ferroelectric phototransistor in which the gate electrode is merged with the source electrode. This design ensures effective gate modulation of the carrier-transport characteristics while applying a channel voltage, thus facilitating the integration and multifunctionality of the devices.

         <title>4D&#8208;Printed Dual&#8208;Functional Hydrogels Breaking the Trade&#8208;Off Between Rapid Kinetics and Ultrahigh Water Uptake for Atmospheric Water Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research is the first to apply a 4D&#8208;printed stimuli&#8208;responsive structure to atmospheric water harvesting systems, where dynamic structural changes overcome the intrinsic limitations of conventional static sorbent materials. 4D&#8208;printed hydrogel successfully breaks the trade&#8208;off between rapid adsorption&#8208;desorption kinetics and ultra&#8208;high water uptake, setting a model for the next generation of hygroscopic materials.








ABSTRACT
Sorption&#8208;based Atmospheric Water Harvesting (AWH) is an innovative approach to mitigate global freshwater scarcity. However, there is a trade&#8208;off between rapid kinetics and ultrahigh water uptake, which is a formidable challenge in designing sorbent materials. Herein, 4D printed dual&#8208;functional hydrogel is constructed through the collaborative design of molecular&#8208;scale dynamic response network and macro&#8208;scale structure. The 4D dual&#8208;functional hydrogel integrates thermoresponsive (PNIPAM) and zwitterionic (PDMPAS) to form dynamic response networks, and is loaded with polypyrrole (PPY) and lithium chloride (4D TZG&#8208;PPY&#8208;LiCl). Simultaneously, 4D TZG&#8208;PPY&#8208;LiCl utilizes an abundant air&#8208;sorbent interface to accelerate moisture absorption kinetics, exhibiting a large swelling ratio under humidity stimulation to capture more water. The moisture absorption rate and water uptake of 4D TZG&#8208;PPY&#8208;LiCl are double those of bulk TZG&#8208;PPY&#8208;LiCl between 30% and 90% RH, exhibiting an ultrahigh water uptake of 1.62&#8211;6.85&#160;g g&#8722;1, which is superior to that of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art sorbents. In addition, the excellent photothermal conversion of 4D TZG&#8208;PPY&#8208;LiCl induces a&#160;hydrophilic to hydrophobic transition&#160;and&#160;structural shrinkage under one&#8208;sun illumination,&#160;facilitating&#160;rapid water release. Furthermore, 4D TZG&#8208;PPY&#8208;LiCl AWH device has been further constructed, enabling continuous freshwater production. This breakthrough provides a new idea for the development of sorbent materials.

         <title>Maximized Full&#8208;Color Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Metal Clusters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Full&#8208;color CPL with the max glum of &#8722;1.68 is achieved from atomically precise metal clusters in the bilayer device, the highest among metal cluster materials. In the device, PMMA integration enhances the luminescence efficiency of metal clusters while maintaining CLCs&#8217; optics. The devices demonstrate their application in photoinduced enantioselective polymerization, realizing light&#8208;to&#8208;matter chiral transfer.








ABSTRACT
Colorful circularly polarized luminescence materials with large luminescence dissymmetry factors (glum) and high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) are desired for 3D display, asymmetric synthesis, and encryption. However, realizing such materials based on metal clusters faces significant hurdles. Here, we disclose full&#8208;color CPL (visible light to near&#8208;infrared) with the maximum glum factor up to &#8722;1.68 from atomically precise metal clusters in bilayer architectures, composed of soft helix chiral liquid crystals (CLCs) layers and metal cluster layers. This glum factor is the highest value reported among all metal cluster&#8208;based materials. In the bilayer architecture device, the luminescence efficiency and stability of the metal clusters are significantly enhanced by their integration into the polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) in the bilayer device, all while perfectly maintaining the optical properties of CLCs. Then, we further demonstrated the application of the metal cluster's excellent full&#8208;color CPL in photoinduced enantioselective polymerization, realizing a chiral transfer from light to matter. This work contributes to the design and synthesis of highly efficient full&#8208;spectrum chiroptical metal cluster materials, as well as the expansion of the application of photoinduced enantioselective polymerization technologies.

         <title>Phase&#8208;Change Solvents for Thermally Switchable Ion Conduction in Organogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organogels containing salts dissolved in phase&#8208;change solvents exhibit thermally switchable ion conduction. The organogels, which display an over 10&#160;000&#8208;fold on&#8208;off ratio and high cycling stability, can be synthesized with a wide range of salts and customizable conductivity/temperature relations for applications in ionotronics and energy storage. Demonstrations as both digital thermal switches and analog temperature sensors highlight the scheme's versatility.








ABSTRACT
Conductive media in which ions carry charge through a solution are foundationally important to batteries, supercapacitors, and ionotronic devices. Shifts in ion mobility imposed by physical changes in the solution can dynamically impact the conductivity of the medium. This paper reports a class of temperature&#8208;responsive phase&#8208;change organogels in which a polymer network is formed within salt solutions in organic solvents with melting points between room temperature and 100 &#176;C. The conductivity in the molten state (up to &#8764;10&#8722;4 to 10&#8722;3&#160;S/cm) exceeded that in the frozen state by over 10&#160;000&#8208;fold and remained stable after holding at 90 &#176;C for 3 h or over 100 freezing/melting cycles. A diverse range of salts can be used, and the conductivity/temperature relationship can be tuned by selecting or mixing solvents with different melting points. Depending on the solvent composition, these phase&#8208;change organogels can either produce approximately digital (binary) thermal responses to function as switches or respond continuously as analog temperature sensors or other transducers. An advantage of this strategy over prior literature is that the identity of the charge carrier and the phase behavior of the solvent can be tuned independently, presenting a wide design space for electrolyte materials whose conductivity responds to temperature.

         <title>Calcium&#8208;Powered Probiotics Reconfigure the Intestinal Niche via Biofilm Transformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A niche reconfiguration&#8208;driven strategy for probiotics&#8217; colonization enhancement is introduced. This therapy involves the coordination&#8208;driven modification of the Des&#8208;antagonistic probiotic Lactobacillus strain, designated Ca2+/KAE@Lap, using Ca2+ and KAE, a natural calcium&#8208;modulating component. By specifically targeting the tripartite causes of colonization resistance mediated by Desulfovibrio biofilms, Ca2+/KAE@Lap ensures calcium&#8208;bridged interfacial binding for enhanced elimination of pathogen and calcium&#8208;restored mucoprotein regeneration for mucus layer remodeling. The Ca2+/KAE@Lap therapeutic intervention drives biofilm composition from Desulfovibrio&#8208;dominated to Lactobacillus&#8208;enriched consortia, concomitant with the redirection of intestinal colonization resistance from a pathogen&#8208;permissive to a probiotic&#8208;favored state.








ABSTRACT
Excessive Desulfovibrio (Des) forms biofilm to enable dominant occupation of the intestinal niche, representing a common pathogenic driver of multiple inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) types. Colonization resistance constitutes the primary barrier to antagonistic probiotic efficacy, and this is driven by the pathogen&#8208;favorable microenvironment established by Des. Here, probiotic Lactiplantibacillus (Lap) is modified by calcium ions (Ca2+) and calcium&#8208;regulative polyphenol (kaempferol&#8208;3&#8208;O&#8208;rutinoside, KAE) via coordinate interaction to achieve intestinal niche reconfiguration. Targeting the tripartite mechanisms of Des&#8208;mediated colonization resistance, the Ca2+/KAE@Lap platform optimized niche competition through Ca2+&#8208;bridged interfacial binding with directional bactericidal activity, and this enables bacterial replacement at occupied sites. Ca2+/KAE@Lap reestablishes calcium homeostasis disrupted by Des via synergistic Ca2+/KAE regulation, dually restoring epithelial energy metabolism and mucus layer reconstitution, counteracting Des&#8208;induced colonized sites contraction and regenerated site impairment. This drives phenotypic shift in biofilm composition from Des&#8208;dominated to Lap&#8208;enriched consortia, which is concomitant with the redirection of intestinal colonization resistance from a pathogen&#8208;permissive to a probiotic&#8208;favored state. This calcium&#8208;based biofilm transformation strategy overcomes the transient colonization limitation inherent in conventional probiotic therapies by effectively disrupting colonization resistance in IBD treatment.

Here, probiotic &lt;i&gt;Lactiplantibacillus&lt;/i&gt; (Lap) is modified by calcium ions (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) and calcium-regulative polyphenol (kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside, KAE) via coordinate interaction to achieve intestinal niche reconfiguration. Targeting the tripartite mechanisms of Des-mediated colonization resistance, the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/KAE@Lap platform optimized niche competition through Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-bridged interfacial binding with directional bactericidal activity, and this enables bacterial replacement at occupied sites. Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/KAE@Lap reestablishes calcium homeostasis disrupted by Des via synergistic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/KAE regulation, dually restoring epithelial energy metabolism and mucus layer reconstitution, counteracting Des-induced colonized sites contraction and regenerated site impairment. This drives phenotypic shift in biofilm composition from Des-dominated to Lap-enriched consortia, which is concomitant with the redirection of intestinal colonization resistance from a pathogen-permissive to a probiotic-favored state. This calcium-based biofilm transformation strategy overcomes the transient colonization limitation inherent in conventional probiotic therapies by effectively disrupting colonization resistance in IBD treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Organic Electrochemical Random&#8208;Access Memory (OECRAM) bridges biology and electronics. This review outlines its mechanisms, key parameters, material advances, and challenges, while envisioning bio&#8208;integrated applications across scales.








ABSTRACT
Organic electrochemical random&#8208;access memory (OECRAM) has emerged as a promising neuromorphic device by mimicking the ion&#8208;modulated synaptic plasticity of biological systems. Leveraging organic semiconductors and ionic conductors, OECRAMs share key features with biological synapses, including a wet operating environment, organic composition, low&#8208;voltage operation, intrinsic flexibility, and multimodal sensing&#8208;memory capabilities. These features break the constraint of traditional in&#8208;memory computing architecture, enabling the seamless integration of OECRAMs with the biological nerve system for neural repair, biohybrid interfaces, and wearable healthcare. Recent advances in material, device, and system design have unlocked the future applications of OECRAMs as a bio&#8208;integrated hardware. This review highlights fundamental mechanisms, device parameters, and their determining factors, material innovations, main challenges, and application frontiers. Finally, three key opportunities for OECRAMs are raised, including implantable artificial nerves for neural functions restoration, bioelectronic hybrid synapses for specific sensing, and multimodal edge&#8208;computing systems for real&#8208;time disease diagnosis. These application scenarios outline the future directions to transition bio&#8208;integrated OECRAMs from laboratory prototypes to clinical and industrial realities.

         <title>Chiral Single&#8208;Atom Nanozymes&#8208;Enabled ROS Catalysis and Metal Transport Regulation Cooperatively Induce Ferroptosis to Treat Bacterial Infections</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral single&#8208;atom nanozymes (Fe&#8208;NSC) are constructed to combat drug&#8208;resistant bacteria by disrupting redox homeostasis and regulating metal transport proteins (MTP). The D&#8208;enantiomer (DFe&#8208;NSC) exhibits stronger enzyme&#8208;like activity, induces ROS generation and intracellular Fe2&#8314; accumulation. This &#8220;chiral catalysis&#8211;MTP regulation&#8221; strategy synergistically triggers ferroptosis&#8208;like death in drug&#8208;resistant bacteria.








ABSTRACT
Nanozyme&#8208;driven ferroptosis provides a promising therapeutic strategy against drug&#8208;resistant bacterial infections by inducing iron overload and oxidative stress. However, bacterial metal transport proteins (MTP) and antioxidant systems can reduce iron accumulation and lipid peroxidation, limiting the efficacy of ferroptosis&#8208;based therapies and promoting resistance. Single&#8208;atom and chiral nanozymes, with their high atomic utilization and catalytic specificity, may provide an effective approach to overcoming bacterial defense mechanisms, which has been not exploited. In this study, we report D&#8208;chiral single&#8208;atom iron&#8211;carbon dot nanozymes (DFe&#8208;NSC) for effective bacterial infection treatment. Compared to L&#8208;chiral form (LFe&#8208;NSC), DFe&#8208;NSC exhibits significantly higher peroxidase (POD)&#8208;like and glutathione peroxidase (GPx)&#8208;like activities. The enhanced catalytic activity promotes reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and glutathione depletion, disrupting bacterial redox homeostasis. More intriguingly, DFe&#8208;NSC more effectively modulates the expression and iron&#8208;regulatory function of MTP (including Fur and FtnA) than LFe&#8208;NSC. This will induce substantial accumulation of Fe2&#8314; intracellularly and thereafter lipid peroxidation, thereby facilitating the bactericidal effects of ferroptosis&#8208;like cell death. Resultantly, DFe&#8208;NSC exhibit markedly enhanced antibacterial and antibiofilm activities in diabetic infected wound and osteomyelitis models. This study introduces a chiral catalysis&#8211;MTP regulation strategy to induce bacterial ferroptosis&#8208;like death, providing a promising alternative for drug&#8208;resistant infection treatment.

         <title>Recent Advances in Collective Behaviors of Micro/Nanomotor Swarms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review describes the driving forces behind collective motion, explores the self&#8208;organization of micro/nano swarms across zero&#8208;dimensional (0D), one&#8208;dimensional (1D), two&#8208;dimensional (2D), and three&#8208;dimensional (3D)&#160;spaces, and highlights their potential in drug delivery, environmental monitoring, and smart devices. It offers insights and perspectives to support future developments and new opportunities in swarm&#8208;based technologies.








ABSTRACT
Collective motion, exemplified by swarming insects, flocking birds, and bacterial colonies, emerges from the synchronized actions and velocity adjustments of individual units. Inspired by these natural phenomena, researchers have sought to replicate and harness collective behavior in swarms of self&#8208;propelled micro/nanomotors. This endeavor is of great importance for the development of multicomponent adaptive systems. Comprising numerous interacting elements, collective swarms exhibit emergent behaviors that capitalize on multi&#8208;motor cooperation, enabling highly efficient, flexible, and robust group performance. Understanding and engineering these behaviors are essential for translating them into practical applications. This review examines the driving forces underlying collective motion, outlines various modes of swarm formation across different dimensions, and highlights representative applications. By linking driving forces, system dimensionality, and functional implementation, it provides a comprehensive perspective on this field.

         <title>Rotational Multimaterial 3D Printing of Soft Robotic Matter With Embedded Asymmetrical Pneumatics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Soft elastomers with embedded, asymmetric channels are created by rotational multimaterial 3D printing. Using a connected Fermat spiral pathing approach, one can automatically generate desired print paths for fabricating complex designs, such as hand&#8208;inspired grippers. Our integrated design and printing approach enables one to rapidly build programmable soft robotic matter that exhibits myriad shape morphing transitions on demand.








ABSTRACT
The rapid design and fabrication of soft robotic matter is of growing interest for shape morphing, actuation, and wearable devices. Here, we report a facile fabrication method for creating soft robotic materials with embedded pneumatics that exhibit programmable shape morphing behavior. Using rotational multimaterial 3D printing, asymmetrical core&#8211;shell filaments composed of elastomeric shells and fugitive channels are patterned in 1D, 2D, and 2.5D motifs. By precisely controlling the nozzle design, rotation rate, extrusion rate, and print path, one can control the local orientation, shape, and cross&#8208;sectional area of the patterned fugitive channel along each printed filament. Once the elastomeric matrix is cured, the fugitive ink is removed, leaving behind embedded channels that facilitate pneumatic actuation. Using a connected Fermat spiral pathing approach, one can automatically generate desired print paths required for more complex soft robots, such as hand&#8208;inspired grippers. Our integrated design and printing approach enables one to rapidly build soft robotic matter that exhibits myriad shape morphing transitions on demand.

         <title>Dislocation&#8208;Enhanced Pyroelectricity in Barium Titanate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce a dislocation engineering strategy to enhance the pyroelectric properties of BaTiO3 single crystals, where high&#8208;temperature plastic deformation creates anisotropic dislocation networks that modulate domain&#8208;wall stability and motion. This approach establishes the coupling of dislocations with domain walls as an effective route for tuning pyroelectric functionality through microstructural design.








ABSTRACT
Pyroelectric materials hold significant promise for thermal sensing, imaging, and energy harvesting, with the pyroelectric coefficient serving as the key figure of merit. While intrinsic lattice optimization, particularly through zero&#8208;dimensional point defects, has improved pyroelectric properties, extrinsic contributions from mobile ferroelectric domain walls have remained underexplored. Here, a dislocation&#8208;based one&#8208;dimensional mechanical doping strategy is proposed to enhance the pyroelectric response of classical ferroelectric BaTiO3 single crystals. By employing high&#8208;temperature plastic deformation, anisotropic dislocation networks are produced that introduce localized stress concentrations and thermal expansion/contraction effects, which amplify domain&#8208;wall motion. These directional strain fields, combined with phonon&#8211;dislocation interactions, lead to an anisotropic coupling of thermal and electrical fields. While the enhanced phonon scattering reduces thermal conductivity, the strong dislocation&#8211;domain&#8208;wall coupling leads to an increase in the temperature sensitivity of polarization and accelerates domain switching, effectively compensating for the reduced heat transport. As a result, the maximum pyroelectric coefficient exceeds 600&#160;nC&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;K&#8722;1, representing a 38&#8208;fold increase compared to the undeformed counterpart. Structural evolution is revealed by synchrotron scanning X&#8208;ray diffraction microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, while multiscale phase&#8208;field simulations corroborate the underlying mechanism. Our work establishes dislocation engineering as an effective new pathway towards domain&#8208;wall&#8208;mediated enhancement of pyroelectric functionality.

While intrinsic lattice optimization, particularly through zero-dimensional point defects, has improved pyroelectric properties, extrinsic contributions from mobile ferroelectric domain walls have remained underexplored. Here, a dislocation-based one-dimensional mechanical doping strategy is proposed to enhance the pyroelectric response of classical ferroelectric BaTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; single crystals. By employing high-temperature plastic deformation, anisotropic dislocation networks are produced that introduce localized stress concentrations and thermal expansion/contraction effects, which amplify domain-wall motion. These directional strain fields, combined with phonon&#8211;dislocation interactions, lead to an anisotropic coupling of thermal and electrical fields. While the enhanced phonon scattering reduces thermal conductivity, the strong dislocation&#8211;domain-wall coupling leads to an increase in the temperature sensitivity of polarization and accelerates domain switching, effectively compensating for the reduced heat transport. As a result, the maximum pyroelectric coefficient exceeds 600&#160;nC&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, representing a 38-fold increase compared to the undeformed counterpart. Structural evolution is revealed by synchrotron scanning X-ray diffraction microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, while multiscale phase-field simulations corroborate the underlying mechanism. Our work establishes dislocation engineering as an effective new pathway towards domain-wall-mediated enhancement of pyroelectric functionality.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Sensitive Nanofiber&#8208;Based Triboelectric Nanogenerator for Energy Harvesting and Self&#8208;Powered Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multidimensional molecular strategy optimizes the tribonegative layer by electrospinning PVDF&#8208;HFP for dipole alignment and crystallinity, followed by 2D borophene doping to enhance conductivity and charge trapping. Integrated with Nylon&#8208;66 nanofibers, the composite device delivers a record sensitivity of 53.8 &#177; 1.2 V kPa&#8722;1 at 3 Hz, enabling ultra&#8208;sensitive sensing for advanced wearable and biomedical applications.








ABSTRACT
Triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) represents a major advancement in capability for self&#8208;powered sensors, with its ability to convert low&#8208;frequency mechanical movements into electricity. These devices serve at present an unmet medical and societal need in the monitoring of human activity and enhancing interactions between humans and machines, the optioned interface for setting up verifiable digital twins. Here, a novel composite nanofibrous TENG (CNF&#8208;TENG) based on borophene@poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF&#8208;HFP) is constructed through electrospinning. Comprehensive materials characterization of the exfoliated nanosheets confirms crystalline sheet morphology and validates their incorporation into the fibers. The inclusion of borophene introduces a dual innovation by enhancing both the jet stressing in electrospinning and the quality of doped films. This improvement is attributed to the enhanced effective permittivity through interfacial polarization, which promotes &#946;&#8208;phase formation, electron&#8208;donating capacity, surface charge trapping, and refined fiber morphology, while inducing a transition from a hydrophobic to a superhydrophobic surface state. When paired with nylon 66 nanofibers, the CNF&#8208;TENG exhibits a remarkable sensitivity of 53.8 &#177; 1.2&#160;V kPa&#8722;1, and a power density of 1.2&#160;W m&#8722;2, representing a 13&#8208;fold enhancement over pristine PVDF&#8208;HFP. An array of 16 ultra&#8208;sensitive CNF&#8208;TENG sensors for possible use in dementia monitoring and sleep disorder mitigation is successfully demonstrated, giving various sleep patterns and physiological data sets.

         <title>A Single&#8208;Crystalline Melon Photocatalyst for Overall Water Splitting with Visible Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we report for the first time the successful synthesis of sub&#8208;50 nm single&#8208;crystalline melon. It was demonstrated to exhibit reduced non&#8208;radiative recombination, longer exciton diffusion lengths, and a higher concentration of surface&#8208;reaching charges compared to conventional melon. Consequently, the single&#8208;crystalline melon exhibits nearly two orders of magnitude higher H2 evolution efficiency in overall water splitting compared to conventional melon.








ABSTRACT
Melon, as an attractive polymeric semiconductor photocatalyst, holds great potential for efficient one&#8208;step excitation of overall water splitting, yet its quantum yields remain limited by low exciton migration efficiency caused by short exciton diffusion lengths and long migration paths. To address this challenge, we employ a flux&#8208;assisted strategy to synthesize sub&#8208;50&#160;nm single&#8208;crystalline melon, which not only prolonged the exciton diffusion length but also shortened the exciton migration path from the bulk exciton coupling region to the catalyst surface. Experimental characterization and structural simulations confirm the successful synthesis of nanoscale single&#8208;crystalline melon via molten salt post&#8208;treatment of amorphous melon in a NaCl&#8208;KCl&#8208;CaCl2 ternary system. More importantly, charge carrier dynamics reveal that single&#8208;crystalline melon, owing to its lower defect density, higher interlayer stacking order, and optimized interlayer stacking mode, exhibits reduced non&#8208;radiative recombination, longer exciton diffusion lengths, and a higher concentration of surface&#8208;reaching charges compared to conventional melon. Consequently, the melon nanocrystals exhibit nearly two orders of magnitude higher H2 evolution efficiency in overall water splitting compared to conventional melon. These findings pave the way for manufacturing polymeric semiconductor nanocrystals for efficient solar energy conversion.

         <title>Heterojunction Synergized Nanofluidic Ionic Diode for High&#8208;Performance Hydrovoltaic Electricity Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterojunction&#8208;synergized nanofluidic ionic diode couples charge separation in SiNWs/Al&#8208;doped TiO2 with rectified OH&#8722;/H3O+ transport in asymmetric nanochannels and nanopores to harvest evaporation&#8208;driven capillary energy. The SiNWs/ATO hydrovoltaic electricity generator delivers record&#8208;high voltage, current density, and power density among state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art HEGs, offering a general strategy for durable, high&#8208;performance ambient low&#8208;grade energy harvesting.








ABSTRACT
Hydrovoltaic electricity generators have emerged as a promising strategy for harvesting low&#8208;grade environmental energy. Yet their output remains limited by inefficient charge separation, hydroxyl&#8208;induced electron trapping, and reverse current loss. Herein, we proposed a heterojunction synergized nanofluidic ionic diode concept to enhance HEG performance. Al&#8208;doped TiO2 (ATO) was conformally deposited on vertically aligned Si nanowires (SiNWs) via atomic layer deposition to form a SiNWs/ATO heterojunction, where the built&#8208;in electric field facilitates the efficient separation of charge induced by evaporation&#8208;driven capillary flow. Simultaneously, a nanofluidic ionic diode is established between positively charged SiNWs/ATO nanochannels and the negatively charged porous CNT membrane, enabling rectified ion&#8208;selective transport. The synergistic effects of the heterojunction and nanofluidic ionic diode significantly promote both electron&#8211;hole separation and anion/cation selective transport. The SiNWs/ATO HEG achieves an updated recorded performance, delivering an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.0&#160;V, a short&#8208;circuit current density of 71.0 &#181;A&#183;cm&#8722;2, and a peak power density of 45.8 &#181;W&#183;cm&#8722;2, approximately twice the highest values previously reported for HEGs. This work not only achieves a mechanistic co&#8208;optimization of charge separation and ionic transport induced by evaporation&#8208;driven capillary flow, but also offers a novel design strategy and practical framework to develop high&#8208;performance and durable HEG.

         <title>Cascade&#8208;Heterostructured Nanofluidics for Photo&#8208;Enhanced Upscaling Osmotic Energy Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cascade&#8208;heterostructured nanofluidics (CHS&#8208;NFs) integrate abundant atomic&#8208;scale type&#8208;I semiconductor and Schottky heterojunctions, which enable continuous and ultrafast coupled electron&#8211;ion transport. These heterointerfaces create localized asymmetric electric fields at the nanoscale, effectively suppressing concentration polarization and compensating for potential drops, thereby achieving both high ion selectivity and high ion flux.








ABSTRACT
Ensuring energy and resource availability constitutes a fundamental pillar of sustainable socioeconomic development. Nanofluidics hold great promise for energy and resource harvesting. However, a critical bottleneck hinders commercialization, namely, that upscaling nanofluidic areas to boost ion currents triggers severe potential drop and concentration polarization, causing a drastic degradation in selectivity. Here, we engineered cascade&#8208;heterostructured nanofluidics (CHS&#8208;NFs) featuring numerous atomic&#8208;level type&#8208;I semiconductor heterojunctions and Schottky junctions to create continuous, ultrafast pathways for coupled electron&#8208;ion transport. The heterointerfaces generate nanoscale localized asymmetric electric fields that mitigate concentration polarization and offset potential drops, thereby realizing high ion selectivity and flux. As a result, the CHS&#8208;NFs achieve a record&#8208;high energy conversion efficiency of 49.5%&#8212;approaching the theoretical limit of 50%&#8212;over a large area (28&#160;mm2, 933 times larger than prior areas), with an exceptional Na+/Cl&#8722; selectivity of 332.3. The electricity produced by CHS&#8208;NFs&#8208;based osmotic cells is effectively stored in capacitors and ion batteries under simulated solar irradiation, exhibiting a 68.8% capacity increase compared with a non&#8208;irradiated one. Notably, the cells can generate a high ionic current (467.6&#160;&#181;A), enabling the selective electrochemical recovery of gold from solutions with near&#8208;100% purity, as well as other valuable metals, significantly reducing the energy footprint of industrial metallurgy.

         <title>Scalable and Multifunctional PAN&#8208;MXene Composite Fibers for Thermal Management, Photothermal Conversion, Energy Harvesting, and Sensing for Wearable Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrospun PAN&#8208;MXene nanofibers and yarns integrate enhanced thermal conductivity, photothermal conversion, and triboelectric energy harvesting within a flexible architecture. Interconnected MXene networks promote efficient phonon transport, while their surface chemistry strengthens tribo&#8208;negative behavior, enabling a high power density of 432.7 mW m&#8722;2 and a sensitive tactile response for multifunctional smart textile applications.








ABSTRACT
Developing multifunctional materials that combine efficient heat conduction, energy harvesting, sensing capability, and flexibility is crucial for next&#8208;generation portable and wearable electronics. Here, exploiting the remarkable properties of Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets, multifunctional polyacrylonitrile (PAN)&#8208;MXene nanofibers and yarns are fabricated via a straightforward and scalable electrospinning process. Incorporation of MXenes enhances the thermal conductivity of individual PAN nanofibers, as measured by scanning thermal microscopy, and greatly increases the heat conduction capacity of composite yarns, showing a &#8764;22&#176;C higher surface temperature recorded by infrared thermography. The composite nanofibers also exhibit strong passive heating capability, rapidly reaching up to 60&#176;C under infrared irradiation. Furthermore, MXenes elevate the tribo&#8208;negative character of PAN nanofibers, decreasing their surface potential to &#8722;360&#160;mV and yielding a high triboelectric power density of 432.7 mW&#160;m&#8722;2, approximately 25% higher than pristine PAN. Moreover, the produced composite yarns demonstrate reliable tactile&#8208;sensing performance, detecting forces as low as 0.1 N. Altogether, these flexible and durable PAN&#8208;MXene structures provide a promising route toward sustainable and energy&#8208;autonomous electronic textiles, offering new opportunities in wearable electronics, soft robotics, and smart sensing systems.

         <title>High Photostrictive Strain Rate in Ferroelectric AlScN Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferroelectric AlScN thin films exhibit an ultrafast photostrictive strain rate of 3.6 s&#8722;1 under above&#8208;bandgap modulated light, about two orders of magnitude higher than conventional bulk ferroelectrics. The fast strain response arises from the nanoscaled columnar polarized domain structure that minimizes RC delay and carrier travel distance. This&#160;further enables non&#8208;contact light&#8208;driven actuation and acoustic&#8208;wave generation.








ABSTRACT
Photostriction refers to non&#8208;thermal strain in materials induced by light, such as through opto&#8208;electro&#8208;mechanical coupling involving the bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) and the converse piezoelectric effect in a ferroelectric material. Conventional ferroelectric photostrictive responses are extremely slow, with strain rates below 10&#8722;3 s&#8722;1 due to the long timescale of BPVE, limiting their use in high&#8208;frequency or signal transmission applications. This work demonstrates a significantly enhanced photostrictive strain rate of 3.6 s&#8722;1 in scandium aluminium nitride (Al0.58Sc0.42N) thin films under modulated continuous light excitation. The light&#8208;induced strain amplitude is equivalent to that of electric&#8208;field induced strain with 2&#160;V applied across the film, underscoring the significant and competitive opto&#8208;mechanical coupling. This fast response is attributed to nanoscale columnar domains that reduce the electric time delay and charge carrier drift distances, enabling rapid strain generation. The demonstrated fast photostriction provides a unique pathway for light&#8208;driven actuation and acoustic wave excitation without requiring electrical wiring, electrodes or electric poling, thus, opening opportunities for developing acoustic micro&#8208;actuators and novel optomechanical systems operating in a non&#8208;contact mode.

         <title>ROS&#8208;Triggered Hemispheroid Adhesive Micromotors for Inflammatory Bowel Disease Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A type of reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive hemispheroid adhesive micromotors (HMPs) as efficient delivery systems is developed to treat inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) here. Such hydrogel micromotors are composed of a platinum (Pt) layer and dopamine (DOPA) coating layer covered on their top surface and baseplate, respectively. Upon exposure to the ROS environment, HMPs can achieve the autonomous propulsion fueled by the generated oxygen bubbles. Consequently, HMPs loaded with dexamethasone (DXM) demonstrated a potent therapeutic effect against IBD.








ABSTRACT
The use of micromotors&#8208;based delivery systems for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) treatment has recently gained considerable interest. The current research primarily focuses on how to design micromotors with more elaborate geometries and actuation mechanisms to improve IBD therapeutic effects. Herein, a novel type of reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive hemispheroid adhesive micromotors (HMPs) as efficient delivery systems is developed to treat IBD. Such HMPs are fabricated through microfluidic electrospray technique, with a platinum (Pt) layer and dopamine (DOPA) coating layer covered on its top surface and baseplate, respectively. The Pt on HMPs&#8242; top surface can produce oxygen from hydrogen peroxide, thereby providing a propulsion force for them to move spontaneously upon exposure to ROS environment. Moreover, the DOPA layer on the baseplate contributed to the outstanding adhesive capacity to tissues. Therefore, by incorporating anti&#8208;inflammatory dexamethasone (DXM) into HMPs, the resultant micromotor systems are imparted with superior antioxidant and anti&#8208;inflammatory capacities, which also exhibits desirable therapeutic effect upon treating IBD by alleviating inflammatory response, restoring epithelial barrier functions, and mitigating IBD&#8208;associated symptoms. The treatment mechanism of DXM&#8208;loaded HMPs mainly involves alleviating oxidative stress, reducing proinflammatory cytokines secretion, and protecting intestinal barrier. Collectively, these results illustrate HMPs&#8208;based micromotor systems are valuable for gastrointestinal disease treatment.

Design in Reticular Chemistry at its Finest
The wealth of knowledge accumulated through years of design in reticular chemistry has become an invaluable toolbox for molecular architects. This review outlines design approaches that can be mastered individually and combined to enrich the repertoire of reticular chemistry with a wide spectrum of functional materials. The cover showcases In&#8208;sod&#8208;ZMOF&#8208;327, illustrating how summoning topology knowledge, molecular and supermolecular building blocks, the geometry mismatch concept, and structure&#8208;directing agents brings reticular chemistry design to its pinnacle. Light rays emanate as a beacon, guiding chemists as it once guided explorers at sea, toward the creation of tailor&#8208;made materials for the future. More details can be found in the Review by Vincent Guillerm, Mohamed Eddaoudi, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202414153).

Covalent Organic Frameworks
In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202415882), Fabian Heck, Lars Grunenberg, Liang Yao, Bettina V. Lotsch, and co&#8208;workers developed a new template&#8208;induced synthetic methodology to realize hierarchically porous COFs (hCOFs) via commercially available zinc oxide nanoparticles as hard template. The introduction of the secondary porosity in the hCOF significantly reduces diffusion limitations, thus leading to simultaneous enhancements in adsorption capacity, diffusivity, and catalytic performance.

         <title>MOFs and COFs for Radionuclide and Nuclear&#8208;Waste Treatment</title>

Reticular porous functional materials, such as MOFs and COFs, toward selective and efficient radioactive waste&#8208;treatment.








Abstract
The ever&#8208;growing energy demand, driven by rapid industrialization and global urbanization, has escalated the development of sustainable nuclear power generation. Nuclear fission and fuel production generate several radioactive byproducts including 79Se, 85Kr, 90Sr, 99Tc, 127Xe, 129/131I, 137Cs, 235U, which pose great threat upon environmental infiltration. The sustainable development of nuclear energy relies on the easy and adequate accessibility of nuclear&#8208;fuels, like uranium, alongside safe and efficient management of the nuclear fuel cycles. To this end, reticular materials such as metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent&#8211;organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as versatile sorbent platforms for efficient treatment of various radionuclides owing to their structural tunability and target specificity. Given that momentous advances have been made in radionuclide treatment by reticular materials in the past few decades, it is important to systematically review and summarize the recent advancements in this field. In this review, a brief overview of the different classes of radioactive&#8208;wastes, and the principles of radioactive waste treatment is first presented. The prerequisites in materials designing are then discussed, followed by the recent progress in MOFs&#8208; and COFs&#8208;materials toward radioactive&#8208;waste&#8208;treatment. Finally, future perspectives on the unresolved scientific and technical challenges are proposed, aiming to fast&#8208;track the translation of these materials toward real&#8208;world implementation.

         <title>Computational Simulations of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks to Enhance Adsorption Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 52, December 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights the significance of molecular simulations in expanding the understanding of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and improving their gas adsorption applications. The historical development and implementation of molecular simulations in the MOF field are given, high&#8208;throughput computational screening studies used to unlock the potential of MOFs in CO2 capture, CH4 storage, H2 storage, and water harvesting are discussed.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), renowned for their exceptional porosity and crystalline structure, stand at the forefront of gas adsorption and separation applications. Shortly after their discovery through experimental synthesis, computational simulations quickly become an important method in broadening the use of MOFs by offering deep insights into their structural, functional, and performance properties. This review specifically addresses the pivotal role of molecular simulations in enlarging the molecular understanding of MOFs and enhancing their applications, particularly for gas adsorption. After reviewing the historical development and implementation of molecular simulation methods in the field of MOFs, high&#8208;throughput computational screening (HTCS) studies used to unlock the potential of MOFs in CO2 capture, CH4 storage, H2 storage, and water harvesting are visited and recent advancements in these adsorption applications are highlighted. The transformative impact of integrating artificial intelligence with HTCS on the prediction of MOFs&#8217; performance and directing the experimental efforts on promising materials is addressed.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), renowned for their exceptional porosity and crystalline structure, stand at the forefront of gas adsorption and separation applications. Shortly after their discovery through experimental synthesis, computational simulations quickly become an important method in broadening the use of MOFs by offering deep insights into their structural, functional, and performance properties. This review specifically addresses the pivotal role of molecular simulations in enlarging the molecular understanding of MOFs and enhancing their applications, particularly for gas adsorption. After reviewing the historical development and implementation of molecular simulation methods in the field of MOFs, high-throughput computational screening (HTCS) studies used to unlock the potential of MOFs in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture, CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; storage, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; storage, and water harvesting are visited and recent advancements in these adsorption applications are highlighted. The transformative impact of integrating artificial intelligence with HTCS on the prediction of MOFs&#8217; performance and directing the experimental efforts on promising materials is addressed. An outlook on current opportunities and challenges in the field to accelerate the adsorption applications of MOFs is finally provided.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Switching from Molecules to Functional Materials: Breakthroughs in Photochromism With MOFs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 52, December 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Uniting the innovative design strategies of reticular chemistry with photoresponsive moieties creates a synergistic relationship that elevates material performance and overcomes common challenges in functional material development. These advances can be realized using photochromic metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) as platforms, paving the way for breakthroughs in the areas of high&#8208;speed and programable optoelectronics, heterogeneous photocatalysis, and beyond.








Abstract
Photochromic materials with properties that can be dynamically tailored as a function of external stimuli are a rapidly expanding field driven by applications in areas ranging from molecular computing, nanotechnology, or photopharmacology to programable heterogeneous catalysis. Challenges arise, however, when translating the rapid, solution&#8208;like response of stimuli&#8208;responsive moieties to solid&#8208;state materials due to the intermolecular interactions imposed through close molecular packing in bulk solids. As a result, the integration of photochromic compounds into synthetically programable porous matrices, such as metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), has come to the forefront as an emerging strategy for photochromic material development. This review highlights how the core principles of reticular chemistry (on the example of MOFs) play a critical role in the photochromic material performance, surpassing the limitations previously observed in solution or solid state. The symbiotic relationship between photoresponsive compounds and porous frameworks with a focus on how reticular synthesis creates avenues toward tailorable photoisomerization kinetics, directional energy and charge transfer, switchable gas sorption, and synergistic chromophore communication is discussed. This review not only focuses on the recent cutting&#8208;edge advancements in photochromic material development, but also highlights novel, vital&#8208;to&#8208;pursue pathways for multifaceted functional materials in the realms of energy, technology, and biomedicine.

         <title>Reticular Materials for Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 52, December 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalysis offers a promising approach for converting solar energy into chemical energy. Reticular materials, such as metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs), possess unique advantages and have shown significant progress in photocatalysis. This review provides a comprehensive summary of strategies for regulating light absorption, charge separation, and surface reaction processes using reticular materials to achieve efficient photocatalysis.








Abstract
Photocatalysis leverages solar energy to overcome the thermodynamic barrier, enabling efficient chemical reactions under mild conditions. It can greatly reduce reliance on traditional energy sources and has attracted significant research interest. Reticular materials, including metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs), represent a class of crystalline materials constructed from molecular building blocks linked by coordination and covalent bonds, respectively. Reticular materials function as heterogeneous catalysts, combining well&#8208;defined structures and high tailorability akin to homogeneous catalysts. In this review, the regulation of light absorption, charge separation, and surface reactions in the photocatalytic process through precise molecular&#8208;level design based on the features of reticular materials is elaborated. Notably, for MOFsmicroenvironment modulation around catalytic sites affects photocatalytic performance is delved, with emphasis on their unique dynamic and flexible microenvironments. For COFs, the inherent excitonic effects due to their fully organic nature is discussed and highlight the strategies to regulate excitonic effects for charge&#8208; and/or energy&#8208;transfer&#8208;mediated photocatalysis. Finally, the current challenges and future directions in this field, aiming to provide a comprehensive understanding of how reticular materials can be optimized for enhanced photocatalysis is discussed.

         <title>Synthetic Aspects and Characterization Needs in MOF Chemistry &#8211; from Discovery to Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 52, December 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Overcoming the challenges of phase discovery, synthesis optimization and scale&#8208;up, characterization, and computational studies is essential to accelerate the large&#8208;scale application of MOFs. Life&#8208;cycle analyses and techno&#8208;economic analyses need to be performed to realistically assess their potential for industrial relevance. This mini&#8208;review provides recommendations, to accelerate and facilitate the knowledge transfer leading to large&#8208;scale applications of MOFs.








Abstract
Even if MOFs are recently developed for large&#8208;scale applications, the road to applications of MOFs is long and rocky. This requires to overcome challenges associated with phase discovery, synthesis optimization, basic and advanced characterization, and computational studies. Lab&#8208;scale results need to be transferred to large&#8208;scale processes, which is often not trivial, and life&#8208;cycle analyses and techno&#8208;economic analyses need to be performed to realistically assess their potential for industrial relevance. Based on the experience in the field of stable, functional MOFs combining advanced synthesis, characterization, and modeling, this mini&#8208;review gives recommendations especially for non&#8208;specialists, for example, from chemical engineers to medical doctors, to accelerate and facilitate knowledge transfer which will ultimately lead to the application of MOFs. The recommendations will include the reporting of synthesis and characterization data as well as standardization and detailed information required for the application of data mining and machine learning techniques, which are increasingly used to accelerate the discovery of new materials and data analysis. Once a suitable MOF is identified and its key properties determined, translational studies shall finally be carried out in collaboration with end&#8208;users to validate performance under real conditions and allow understanding of the processes involved.

         <title>Computational Modeling of Reticular Materials: The Past, the Present, and the Future</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 52, December 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reticular materials are advanced materials with applications in emerging technologies. A thorough understanding of material properties at operating conditions is critical to accelerate the deployment at an industrial scale. Herein, the status of computational modeling of reticular materials is reviewed, supplemented with topical examples highlighting recent modeling successes. Open challenges in the field are discussed to inspire future model developments.








Abstract
Reticular materials rely on a unique building concept where inorganic and organic building units are stitched together giving access to an almost limitless number of structured ordered porous materials. Given the versatility of chemical elements, underlying nets, and topologies, reticular materials provide a unique platform to design materials for timely technological applications. Reticular materials have now found their way in important societal applications, like carbon capture to address climate change, water harvesting to extract atmospheric moisture in arid environments, and clean energy applications. Combining predictions from computational materials chemistry with advanced experimental characterization and synthesis procedures unlocks a design strategy to synthesize new materials with the desired properties and functions. Within this review, the current status of modeling reticular materials is addressed and supplemented with topical examples highlighting the necessity of advanced molecular modeling to design materials for technological applications. This review is structured as a templated molecular modeling study starting from the molecular structure of a realistic material towards the prediction of properties and functions of the materials. At the end, the authors provide their perspective on the past, present of future in modeling reticular materials and formulate open challenges to inspire future model and method developments.

The global energy crisis and environmental concerns are driving research into renewable energy and sustainable energy conversion and storage technologies. Solar energy, as an ideal sustainable resource, has significant potential to contribute to the goal of net&#8208;zero carbon emissions if effectively harnessed and converted into a reliable and storable form of energy. Photocatalysts have the potential to convert sunlight into chemical energy carriers. In this respect, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have shown great promise due to their tunable structure on different length scales, high surface areas, and beneficial optical properties such as broad visible light absorption. This review offers a comprehensive overview of the key developments in COF&#8208;based photocatalysts for various applications, including water splitting, hydrogen peroxide generation, organic transformations, and carbon dioxide and nitrogen reduction. The underlying mechanisms, essential principles for material design, and structure&#8208;function relationships of COFs in various photocatalytic applications are discussed. The challenges faced by COF&#8208;based photocatalysts are also summarized and various strategies to enhance their performance are explained, such as improving crystallinity, regulating molecular structures, tailoring linkages, and incorporating cocatalysts. Finally, critical strategies are proposed for the utilization of photocatalytically generated chemicals into value&#8208;added products.

         <title>Advancing Metal&#8211;Organic Framework&#8208;Based Composites for Effective Chemical Warfare Agent Detoxification under Real&#8208;World Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 52, December 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review describes recent developments in the design and synthesis of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOF)/textile composites for the detoxification of chemical warfare agent and simulants with extensive discussion on the advantages and disadvantages of different methods. It also summarizes design rules for more active MOF catalysts and provides the implementation principles to achieve desired performances in practical conditions.








Abstract
Threats from toxic chemical warfare agents (CWAs) persist due to war and terrorist attacks, endangering both human beings and the environment. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), which feature ordered pore structures and excellent tunability at both metal/metal cluster nodes and organic linkers, are regarded as the best candidates to directly remove CWAs and their simulants via both physical adsorption and chemically catalyzed hydrolysis or oxidization. MOFs have attracted significant attention in the last two decades that has resulted from the rapid development of MOF&#8208;based materials in both fundamental research and real&#8208;world applications. In this review, the authors focus on the recent advancements in designing and constructing functional MOF&#8208;based materials toward CWAs detoxification and discuss how to bridge the gap between fundamental science and real&#8208;world applications. With detailed summaries from different points of view, this review provides insights into design rules for developing next&#8208;generation MOF&#8208;based materials for protection from both organophosphorus and organosulfur CWAs to mitigate potential threats from CWAs used in wars and terrorism attacks.

         <title>From Elementary to Advanced Design of Functional Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks: A User Guide to Deciphering the Reticular Chemistry Toolbox</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 52, December 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
From the simplest assembly to complex multicomponent materials, a comprehensive guide is provided here to understand from a topology related point of view, through the description of archetypical examples and intuitive illustrations, the multiple design strategies developed in reticular chemistry to synthesize made&#8208;to&#8208;order materials.








Abstract
Here, the fundamental requirements are described for understanding and using topology tools in the design of porous materials, emphasizing the relationships between nets, metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) structures, nodes, and building blocks. Common design approaches are discussed, highlighting prerequisites for the rational design of MOFs, such as those with simple pcu topology through the molecular building block approach, or axial&#8208;to&#8208;axial pillaring. The importance of highly connected nets and building units is emphasized for achieving structural predictability. The geometrical requirements are detailed for designing highly connected MOFs using more elaborate strategies: MOFs with rht topology through the supermolecular building block approach, tbo topology through the supermolecular building layer approach, and sph topology through a merged net approach The potential for innovation through deviations from default nets, such as introducing a geometry mismatch is addressed, which can lead to novel materials with unique zeolitic structures. Examples include MOFs with sodalite (sod) topology, developed through cantellation or mixed&#8208;ligand approaches inspired by ancestral architectural methods, utilizing centring structure&#8208;directing agents. Key insights for researchers are provided to facilitate the application and expansion of design strategies to new chemical systems. The only limit is imagination, along with some chemical, physical, and thermodynamical principles, of course.

         <title>Supramolecular Chemistry in Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 52, December 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights synergies between reticular chemistry and supramolecular chemistry. The role of supramolecular interactions in determining framework&#8230;guest interactions and attempts to understand dynamic behavior in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), particularly emphasizing the development of crystal sponges, studying reactions in frameworks and attempts to control pore behavior through the incorporation of mechanically&#8208;interlocked molecules, is explored.








Abstract
Far from being simply rigid, benign architectures, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) exhibit diverse interactions with their interior environment. From developing crystal sponges to studying reactions in framework materials, the role of both supramolecular chemistry and framework structure is evident.&#160;We explore the&#160;role of supramolecular chemistry in determining framework&#8230;guest interactions and attempts to understand the dynamic behavior in MOFs, including attempts to control pore behavior through the incorporation of mechanically&#8208;interlocked molecules. Appreciating and understanding the role of supramolecular interactions and dynamic behavior in metal&#8211;organic frameworks emerge as important directions for the field.

         <title>Adsorption and Separation by Flexible MOFs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 52, December 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) present significant potential for gas storage and separation due to their structural dynamic. This review explores the rationale behind the flexible MOFs' enhanced working capacity and separation factors. It also addresses key challenges, including phase transition kinetics, crystal robustness, cycling, shaping, and thermal management, and highlights advanced characterization methods essential for global understanding of flexibility phenomena.








Abstract
Flexible metal&#8211;organic frameworks&#160;(MOFs) offer unique opportunities due to their dynamic structural adaptability. This review explores the impact of flexibility on gas adsorption, highlighting key concepts for gas storage and separation. Specific examples demonstrate the principal effectiveness of flexible frameworks in enhancing gas uptake and working capacity. Additionally, mixed gas adsorption and separation of mixtures are reviewed, showcasing their potential in selective gas separation. The review also discusses the critical role of the single gas isotherms analysis and adsorption conditions in designing separation experiments. Advanced combined characterization techniques are crucial for understanding the behavior of flexible MOFs, including monitoring of phase transitions, framework&#8211;guest and guest&#8211;guest interactions. Key challenges in the practical application of flexible adsorbents are addressed, such as the kinetics of switching, volume change, and potential crystal damage during phase transitions. Furthermore, the effects of additives and shaping on flexibility and the &#8220;slipping off effect&#8221; are discussed. Finally, the benefits of phase transitions beyond improved working capacity and selectivity are outlined, with a particular focus on the advantages of intrinsic thermal management. This review highlights the potential and challenges of using flexible MOFs in gas storage and separation technologies, offering insights for future research and application.

         <title>State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;Art, Insights, and Perspectives for MOFs&#8208;Nanocomposites and MOF&#8208;Derived (Nano)Materials</title>

Different approaches to MOF&#8208;NP composite formation, such as ship&#8208;in&#8208;a&#8208;bottle, bottle&#8208;around&#8208;the&#8208;ship and in situ one&#8208;step synthesis, are used. Owing to synergistic effects, the advantageous features of the components of the composites are beneficially combined, and their individual drawbacks are mitigated. In this way, the performance in applications ranging from batteries and supercapacitors to chemical catalysis, electrocatalysis, sensing, photodegradation of contaminants, and biomedicine is boosted.








Abstract
Composite structures created from metal&#8210;organic framework (MOF) matrices are reviewed in this work. Depending on the nature of the second component apart from the MOF platform, several synergistic properties may arise; at the same time, the initial features of the single constituent materials are usually maintained, and individual shortcomings are mitigated. Currently, timely energy and environmental challenges necessitate the quest for more advanced materials and technologies. Significant developments in MOF&#8208;nanocomposites have enabled their application across a wide range of modern and traditional fields. This review demonstrates in an exhaustive and critical way a broad range of MOF&#8208;based nanocomposites, namely, MOF/perovskite nanoparticles (NPs), MOF/metal (non&#8208;iron) oxide NPs, MOF/Fe3O4 NPs, MOF/metal chalcogenide NPs, MOF/metal NPs, and MOF/carbon&#8208;based materials, as well as nanocomposites of MOFs with other semiconductor NPs. Key points related to the synthesis, characterization, and applications of these materials are provided. Depending on their configuration, the composites under discussion can be applied in domains such as photoelectrochemical sensing, antibiotic/dye degradation, optoelectronics, photovoltaics, catalysis, solar cells, supercapacitors, batteries, water remediation, and drug loading. Sometimes, MOFs can undergo certain processes (e.g. pyrolysis) and act as precursors for composite materials with appealing characteristics. Therefore, a special section in the manuscript is devoted to MOF&#8208;derived NP composites. Toward the end of the text, we conclude while also describing the challenges and possibilities for further investigations in the umbrella of material categories analyzed herein. Despite the progress achieved, key questions remain to be answered regarding the relationships among the morphology, properties, and polyvalent activity of these materials. The present work aims to shed light on most of their aspects and innovative prospects, facilitating a deeper comprehension of the underlying phenomena, functionality, and mechanistic insights governing their behavior.

         <title>Reticulating Crystalline Porous Materials for Asymmetric Heterogeneous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 52, December 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights the emerging role of CMOFs and CCOFs in heterogeneous asymmetric catalysis. It provides an overview of recent advancements in design strategies, synthetic approaches, and catalytic applications, discussing the structure&#8211;property relationships that connect their unique structural features to enantioselective performance, while also outlining future challenges and opportunities.








Abstract
Asymmetric catalysis is essential for addressing the increasing demand for enantiopure compounds. Recent advances in reticular chemistry have demonstrated that metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs) possess highly regular porous architectures, exceptional tunability, and the ability to incorporate chiral functionalities through their open channels or cavities. These characteristics make them highly effective and enantioselective catalysts for a wide range of asymmetric transformations. The chiral microenvironments within these frameworks facilitate precise control over reactant orientation and transition states, enhancing both catalytic activity and enantioselectivity, thereby offering significant advantages over traditional systems. This review overviews recent developments in chiral MOFs (CMOFs) and chiral COFs (CCOFs), focusing on their design strategies, and synthetic methods, and highlights the structure&#8211;property relationships that connect key structural features to asymmetric catalytic performance. Additionally, the current challenges and future prospects in this field are addressed, highlighting the pivotal role of reticular chemistry in the creation of chiral porous materials. It is anticipated that this review will inspire further research into the application of crystalline porous materials in asymmetric catalysis and promote the rational design of novel chiral heterogeneous catalysts for industrial use.

         <title>Mechanochemistry for Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks and Covalent&#8211;Organic Frameworks (MOFs, COFs): Methods, Materials, and Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 52, December 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An overview is provided of the mechanochemistry of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (COFs), highlighting opportunities and strategies for discovery, synthesis and reactivity studies of these materials. Mechanistic studies and comparisons to the mechanochemistry of organic solids are outlined, showcasing how advances in mechanochemistry promoted the development of MOF chemistry, and vice versa.








Abstract
The mechanochemistry of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) is a well&#8208;established field whose development has advanced the understanding and the design of both MOF materials and mechanochemical reactions. This review outlines the close and mutually beneficial interplay of these two fields over the past two decades, including the description of mechanochemical strategies to access MOFs as well as the response of these materials to mechanical treatment and/or stress. Furthermore, we highlight how the use of MOFs as model targets for mechanochemical synthesis simultaneously improves the accessibility and understanding of this class of materials and, conversely, advances the experimental and fundamental understanding of mechanochemical reactions. Similarly, we show the reciprocal benefits of comparing the mechanochemistry of organic molecular solids to that of MOFs. Finally, this review also portrays the rapid emergence of mechanochemistry of covalent&#8208;organic frameworks, a young area that promises to deliver new, rapid, efficient, solventless, and room&#8208;temperature access to these materials.

         <title>Advancing from MOFs and COFs to Functional Macroscopic Porous Constructs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 52, December 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review study investigates the recent progress and methodologies for manufacturing metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) or covalent&#8211;organic framework (COF)&#8208;based 3D structured macroscopic porous constructs with high structural integrity, providing the possibility to control their porosity across dimensions. This improves the capability of MOFs/COFs far beyond their powdery form, enabling a wealth of opportunities in various disciplines toward crucial societal demands.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (COFs) are the highly porous rising stars of reticular chemistry. However, most face challenges such as poor macroscopic structuring capability, inadequate mechanical robustness, and inaccessible porosities for target reactants, which hinder their practical applications. This review explores various strategies to assemble MOFs and COFs into macroscopic 3D&#8208;structured multi&#8208;scale porous structures, such as aerogels, foams, and sponges. The methods discussed include direct mixing, self&#8208;shaping, in situ growth, template&#8208;assisted approaches, and 3D printing. These strategies enable macroscopic MOF or COF porous structures to achieve excellent mechanical strength and tunable porosity from the molecular level and micro&#8208;scale up to the macroscopic level. This structural tunability allows the MOF or COF porous structures to outperform their neat powders by making their micro&#8208; and meso&#8208;porosities more accessible to target reactants. Such improvements pave the way for the functionality of MOF or COF species at larger scales, addressing urgent societal needs, including environmental remediation, CO2 capturing, value&#8208;added catalytic reactions, water harvesting, electromagnetic (EM) shielding, and beyond.

         <title>Advancements in Understanding the Physicochemical Properties of Reticular Materials: An In Situ and Operando Spectroscopic Perspective</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 52, December 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores how in situ and operando spectroscopic techniques reveal the real&#8208;time behavior of reticular materials, including MOFs and COFs. These methods track material formation and functionalization, structural changes, defect formation, dynamic responses to external triggers, and catalytic processes. Key findings and future opportunities are highlighted, offering pathways to enhance the design and functionality of these materials.








Abstract
The application of in situ and operando spectroscopic techniques has significantly advanced the understanding of reticular materials, particularly metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs). These techniques offer real&#8208;time insights into the dynamic structural, electronic, and chemical changes that occur within these materials during various processes, such as catalysis, sorption, and material synthesis. This review offers a comprehensive overview of key in situ and operando techniques used to investigate the formation, functionalization, and catalytic behavior of reticular materials. How these techniques have elucidated the roles of active sites, reaction intermediates, and structural transformations under reaction conditions, especially in single&#8208;site catalysis, electrocatalysis, and photocatalysis, is highlighted. The review also discusses the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead in integrating advanced spectroscopic methods with reticular materials, aiming to foster further innovation in the design and application of these versatile materials.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Framework&#8208;Based Antimicrobial Touch Surfaces to Prevent Cross&#8208;Contamination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 52, December 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A MOF&#8208;based antimicrobial door handle cover is developed. It completely inhibits the cross&#8208;contamination of Gram&#8208;positive bacterial species (Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis), Gram&#8208;negative bacterial species (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii), and fungi (Candida albicans).








Abstract
Infection diseases are a major threat to global public health, with nosocomial infections being of particular concern. In this context, antimicrobial coatings emerge as a promising prophylactic strategy to reduce the transmission of pathogens and control infections. Here, antimicrobial door handle covers to prevent cross&#8208;contamination are prepared by incorporating iodine&#8208;loaded UiO&#8208;66 microparticles into a potentially biodegradable polyurethane polymer (Baycusan eco E 1000). These covers incorporate MOF particles that serve as both storage reservoirs and delivery systems for the biocidal iodine. Under realistic touching conditions, the door handle covers completely inhibit the transmission of Gram&#8208;positive bacterial species (Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis), Gram&#8208;negative bacterial species (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii), and fungi (Candida albicans). The covers remain effective even after undergoing multiple contamination cycles, after being cleaned, and when tinted to improve discretion and usability. Furthermore, as the release of iodine from the door handle covers follow hindered Fickian diffusion, their antimicrobial lifetime is calculated to be as long as approximately two years. Together, these results demonstrate the potential of these antimicrobial door handle covers to prevent cross&#8208;contamination, and underline the efficacy of integrating MOFs into innovative technologies.

         <title>Digitonin&#8208;Loaded Nanoscale Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Radiotherapy&#8208;Radiodynamic Therapy and Disulfidptosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 52, December 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mitochondria&#8208;targeted cationic nanoscale metal organic framework shows strong radiotherapy&#8208;radiodynamic therapy effects and selectively releases digitonin in acidic tumor microenvironments to induce disulfidptosis of cancer cells and downregulate immune checkpoints in cancer and T cells, thereby eliciting strong antitumor immunity to effectively inhibit tumor growth.








Abstract
The efficacy of radiotherapy (RT) is limited by inefficient X&#8208;ray absorption and reactive oxygen species generation, upregulation of immunosuppressive factors, and a reducing tumor microenvironment (TME). Here, the design of a mitochondria&#8208;targeted and digitonin (Dig)&#8208;loaded nanoscale metal&#8208;organic framework, Th&#8208;Ir&#8208;DBB/Dig, is reported to overcome these limitations and elicit strong antitumor effects upon low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray irradiation. Built from Th6O4(OH)4 secondary building units (SBUs) and photosensitizing Ir(DBB)(ppy)22+ (Ir&#8208;DBB, DBB&#160;=&#160;4,4&#8242;&#8208;di(4&#8208;benzoato)&#8722;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine; ppy&#160;=&#160;2&#8208;phenylpyridine) ligands, Th&#8208;Ir&#8208;DBB exhibits strong RT&#8208;radiodynamic therapy (RDT) effects via potent radiosensitization with high&#8208;Z SBUs for hydroxyl radical generation and efficient excitation of Ir&#8208;DBB ligands for singlet oxygen production. Th&#8208;Ir&#8208;DBB/Dig releases digitonin in acidic TMEs to trigger disulfidptosis of cancer cells and sensitize cancer cells to RT&#8208;RDT through glucose and glutathione depletion. The released digitonin simultaneously downregulates multiple immune checkpoints in cancer cells and T cells through cholesterol depletion. As a result, Th&#8208;Ir&#8208;DBB/dig plus X&#8208;ray irradiation induces strong antitumor immunity to effectively inhibit tumor growth in mouse models of colon and breast cancer.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Modified Zr&#8208;MOFs with AIE Ligands for Boosting CO2 Adsorption and Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 52, December 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel AIE&#8208;active ligand, tetraphenylpyrazine (PTTBPC), is designed based on reticular chemistry and utilized for the first time to construct a series of robust Zr/(Ni, Co)&#8208; PTTBPC photocatalysts. The single&#8208;phase multi&#8208;component synergy of pore structure, unique photo&#8208;active AIE ligands, and dual&#8208;metal catalytic sites result in the excellent CO2 uptake and reduction performance. The highest CO production rate of 293.2&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#160;h&#8722;1 under 420&#160;nm LED light is achieved, showcasing the potential of AIE ligands in photocatalytic CO2 conversion.








Abstract
The design and synthesis of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with outstanding light&#8208;harvesting and photoexcitation for artificial photocatalytic CO2 reduction is an attractive but challenging task. In this work, a novel aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;active ligand, tetraphenylpyrazine (PTTBPC) is proposed and utilized for the first time to construct a Zr&#8208;MOF photocatalyst via coordination with stable Zr&#8208;oxo clusters. Zr&#8208;MOF is featured by a scu topology with a two&#8208;fold interpenetrated framework, wherein the PTTBPC ligands enable strong light&#8208;harvesting and photoexcitation, while the Zr&#8208;oxo clusters facilitate CO2 adsorption and activation, as well as offer potential sites for further metal modification. Consequently, the Zr&#8208;PTTBPC and its Co/Ni derivatives not only exhibit exceptional stability and high CO2 adsorption capability (73&#160;cm3 g&#8722;1 at 273 K and 1 atm), but also demonstrate a CO production rate of up to 293.2&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#160;h&#8722;1 under 420&#160;nm LED light that can be reused for at least three cycles. With insights from charge&#8208;carrier dynamics and theoretical calculations, the underlying mechanism is revealed, confirming that the single&#8208;phase multi&#8208;component synergy is the key for the outstanding photocatalytic CO2 reduction. This work showcases a brand&#8208;new type of MOF photocatalyst based on AIE ligands and their promising applications in photocatalytic C1 conversion.

         <title>Structural Control of Photoconductivity in a Flexible Titanium&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 52, December 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of flexibility is extended to titanium frameworks and use it to gain control over charge transport. MUV&#8208;35 is a flexible doubly interpenetrated framework that can shrink spontaneously its volume by &#8776;40% to afford a photoconductive, porous state that is thermodynamically favored by non&#8208;covalent interactions.








Abstract
The soft nature of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) sets them apart from other non&#8208;synthetic porous materials. Their flexibility allows the framework components to rearrange in response to environmental changes, leading to different states and properties. The work extends this concept to titanium frameworks, demonstrating control over charge transport in porous molecular crystals. MUV&#8208;35 is a two&#8208;fold catenated framework composed of heterometallic TiMn2 trimers and electron donor 4,4&#8242;,4&#8243;&#8208;(benzo[1,2&#8208;b:3,4&#8208;b&#8217;:5,6&#8208;b&#8243;]trithiophene&#8208;2,5,8&#8208;triyl)tribenzoic acid (H3BTTTB) linkers, forming a rare sit&#8208;c net topology that can fold to reduce its volume by &#8776;40% through a single&#8208;crystal transformation controlled by linker conformation in open, intermediate, and closed states. This process, driven by a free energy difference of &#8776;300&#160;kJ&#160;mol&#8722;1, originates from the formation of a continuous network of non&#8208;covalent interactions that force the spontaneous loss of the solvent in the pores of the framework to establish charge transport pathways that afford photocurrents of 2.5 &#215; 10&#8722;3&#160;S&#160;m&#8722;1 under visible light for an ON/OFF ratio (&#8710;R) of four orders of magnitude. This photoconductivity rivals the best conductivity values described for though&#8208;transport conductive MOFs while maintaining a porosity of &#8776;1.000&#160;m2&#160;g&#8722;1.

MUV-35 is a two-fold catenated framework composed of heterometallic TiMn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; trimers and electron donor 4,4&#8242;,4&#8243;-(benzo[1,2-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;:3,4-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;&#8217;:5,6-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;&#8243;]trithiophene-2,5,8-triyl)tribenzoic acid (H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;BTTTB) linkers, forming a rare sit-c net topology that can fold to reduce its volume by &#8776;40% through a single-crystal transformation controlled by linker conformation in open, intermediate, and closed states. This process, driven by a free energy difference of &#8776;300&#160;kJ&#160;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, originates from the formation of a continuous network of non-covalent interactions that force the spontaneous loss of the solvent in the pores of the framework to establish charge transport pathways that afford photocurrents of 2.5 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;S&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under visible light for an ON/OFF ratio (&#8710;R) of four orders of magnitude. This photoconductivity rivals the best conductivity values described for though-transport conductive MOFs while maintaining a porosity of &#8776;1.000&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rational Design of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Pancreatic Cancer Therapy: from Machine Learning Screening to In Vivo Efficacy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 52, December 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work explores the MOF landscape to select a single, optimal candidate for successfully delivering cancer drugs (gemcitabine, paclitaxel, SN&#8208;38) into tough pancreatic tumors. Machine learning and simulations guide this search, demonstrating colloidal stability, excellent biocompatibility, cellular uptake, and sustained release. With long&#8208;term stability, the paclitaxel&#8208;loaded hydrogel formulation achieves remarkable in vivo results, shrinking tumors and reducing metastasis.









Abstract
Despite improvements in cancer survival rates, metastatic and surgery&#8208;resistant cancers, such as pancreatic cancer, remain challenging, with poor prognoses and limited treatment options. Enhancing drug bioavailability in tumors, while minimizing off&#8208;target effects, is crucial. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as promising drug delivery vehicles owing to their high loading capacity, biocompatibility, and functional tunability. However, the vast chemical diversity of MOFs complicates the rational design of biocompatible materials. This study employed machine learning and molecular simulations to identify MOFs suitable for encapsulating gemcitabine, paclitaxel, and SN&#8208;38, and identified PCN&#8208;222 as an optimal candidate. Following drug loading, MOF formulations are improved for colloidal stability and biocompatibility. In vitro studies on pancreatic cancer cell lines have shown high biocompatibility, cellular internalization, and delayed drug release. Long&#8208;term stability tests demonstrated a consistent performance over 12 months. In vivo studies in pancreatic tumor&#8208;bearing mice revealed that paclitaxel&#8208;loaded PCN&#8208;222, particularly with a hydrogel for local administration, significantly reduced metastatic spread and tumor growth compared to the free drug. These findings underscore the potential of PCN&#8208;222 as an effective drug delivery system for the treatment of hard&#8208;to&#8208;treat cancers.

         <title>Radioactive Diselenide Bonded Covalent Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 52, December 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A covalent organic framework (COF) with a diselenide bond is rationally designed as a radioactive PANoptosis inducer to potentiate tumor radiosensitivity. This diselenide COF effectively promotes the formation of Z&#8208;DNA, and reprograms the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, thereby enhancing the overall effectiveness of radiotherapy, and making it a promising candidate for cancer treatment.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are porous crystals of high potential in biomedical applications. The chemical bonds within COF structures are critical for the overall therapeutic performance. Here, the design and synthesis of radioactive COF are reported by introducing labile diselenide bonds into the structure backbone. This diselenide bonded COF, PorSe&#8208;CuPt, constructed from Cu and Pt ion porphyrin units, is capable of bond cleavage upon irradiation, thus releasing the drug molecule, CBL0137, carried in the pores. Concerted with the promotion of X&#8208;ray absorption by Pt2&#8314; and the enrichment of oxygen by Cu2&#8314;, robust PANoptosis is achieved as well as improved immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, thereby drastically enhancing the overall effectiveness of radiotherapy. The integration of diselenide bonds into the COF backbone demonstrates the possible application of clip&#8208;off chemistry in the search for highly responsible and compatible biomaterials.

         <title>Symmetry is the Key to the Design of Reticular Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 52, December 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Computational prediction of the molecular structure of porous materials, particularly reticular framework materials such as MOFs and COFs, remains a significant challenge. Considering the symmetry of the building blocks that form the desired material, and a similarity score with existing experimentally characterized structures, helps identify promising new candidates; which can subsequently be used for further computational modeling and experimental validation.








Abstract
De novo prediction of reticular framework structures is a challenging task for chemists and materials scientists. Herein, a computational workflow that predicts a list of possible reticular frameworks based on only the connectivity and symmetry of node and linker building blocks is presented. This list is ranked based on the occurrence of topologies in known structures, thus providing a manageable number of structures that can be optimized using density functional theory, and inform future experiments. This workflow is broadly applicable, correctly predicts known reticular materials, and furthermore identifies novel unknown phases for some systems. This workflow is available online at https://rationaldesign.pythonanywhere.com/.

         <title>Light&#8208;Directed Self&#8208;Powered Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Based Nanorobots for Deep Tumor Penetration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 52, December 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops a strategy involving light&#8208;directed self&#8208;powered metal&#8208;organic framework based nanorobots that exhibit negative phototaxis in the acidic tumor microenvironment for transporting therapeutics in a specific deep&#8208;into&#8208;tumor direction. Such nanorobots achieve deep tumor penetration under red light for highly effective drug delivery. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate that the nanorobots possess excellent tumor&#8208;killing performance and biosafety.








Abstract
Effective intratumoral distribution of anticancer agents with good tumor penetration is of great practical importance for oncotherapy. How to break the limitation of traditional passive drug delivery relying on blood circulatory system into solid tumors remains a challenge. Herein, a light&#8208;directed self&#8208;powered nanorobot based on zirconium&#8208;based porphyrin metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) is reported for smart delivery of chemodrug and photosensitizer for deep tumor penetration. The MOF&#8208;based carrier transporting the therapeutics is able to responsively generate hydrogen sulfide as propulsion gas and uniquely exhibits negative phototaxis in acidic tumor microenvironment. Under red light irradiation, the nanorobots are accordingly propelled from the tumor surface toward deep tumor far away from the exterior light source in a specific deep&#8208;into&#8208;tumor direction, greatly enhancing tumor penetration. Along with tumor&#8208;responsive release and activation of the delivered therapeutics inside tumor tissues, photo&#8208;chemotherapy with significantly improved efficacy is achieved.

         <title>Solvothermal Template&#8208;Induced Hierarchical Porosity in Covalent Organic Frameworks: A Pathway to Enhanced Diffusivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 52, December 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchically porous covalent organic frameworks (hCOFs) are constructed using a solvothermal template&#8208;induced synthetic strategy. Commercially available zinc oxide nanoparticles are employed as hard template enabling an increase in total pore volume in a series of COFs. The hierarchically porous nature of hCOFs significantly reduces diffusion limitations, thus leading to simultaneous enhancements in adsorption capacity, diffusivity, and catalytic performance.








Abstract
The rapid advancement of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) in recent years has firmly established them as a new class of molecularly precise and highly tuneable porous materials. However, compared to other porous materials, such as zeolites and metal&#8208;organic frameworks, the successful integration of hierarchical porosity into COFs remains largely unexplored. The challenge lies in identifying appropriate synthetic methods to introduce secondary pores without compromising the intrinsic structural porosity of COFs. In this study, a template&#8208;induced synthetic methodology is realized to facilitate the construction of hierarchically porous COFs (hCOFs). This novel approach utilizes commercially available zinc oxide nanoparticles as a hard template, enabling to increase the total pore volume of a series of &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked COFs as well as an imine&#8208;based COF while preserving their surface areas. In addition to transmission electron microscopy and gas adsorption analyses, small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering and pulsed field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance techniques are employed to investigate the hierarchical porosity and diffusivity of guest molecules within hCOFs. This study demonstrates that the hierarchically porous nature of hCOFs significantly reduces diffusion limitations, thus leading to simultaneous enhancements in adsorption capacity, diffusivity, and catalytic performance.

Commercially available zinc oxide nanoparticles are employed as hard template enabling an increase in total pore volume in a series of COFs.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rapid advancement of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) in recent years has firmly established them as a new class of molecularly precise and highly tuneable porous materials. However, compared to other porous materials, such as zeolites and metal-organic frameworks, the successful integration of hierarchical porosity into COFs remains largely unexplored. The challenge lies in identifying appropriate synthetic methods to introduce secondary pores without compromising the intrinsic structural porosity of COFs. In this study, a template-induced synthetic methodology is realized to facilitate the construction of hierarchically porous COFs (hCOFs). This novel approach utilizes commercially available zinc oxide nanoparticles as a hard template, enabling to increase the total pore volume of a series of &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-ketoenamine-linked COFs as well as an imine-based COF while preserving their surface areas. In addition to transmission electron microscopy and gas adsorption analyses, small-angle X-ray scattering and pulsed field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance techniques are employed to investigate the hierarchical porosity and diffusivity of guest molecules within hCOFs. This study demonstrates that the hierarchically porous nature of hCOFs significantly reduces diffusion limitations, thus leading to simultaneous enhancements in adsorption capacity, diffusivity, and catalytic performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 52, December 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To shape the future course of research in reticular materials, this work reflects on the progress over the past 30 years, complemented by input from the community of 228 active researchers through a global, crowdsourced survey: ranging from demographics, how it works, publish and interact, to highlights on both academic and industrial milestones, as well as remaining challenges.








Abstract
The field of reticular materials, such as metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs), is expanding continuously &#8211; be it in terms of novel structures, advanced characterization techniques, or record&#8208;breaking physical properties for applications. This timeline review reflects on the progress over the past 30 years, complemented by input from the community of active researchers. Owing to a global, crowdsourced survey of 228 researchers that is conducted through an online questionnaire, recent insights into the demographics of the field are given. Besides revealing how it works, publish, and interact, the review highlights both academic and industrial milestones. The contemporary trends are described, both at the level of material development and their suitability for a range of applications. To pave the way for newcomers to the field, some remaining challenges and steps to overcome them are discussed. The findings from this contemplative review aim to shape the future course of research in this domain.

         <title>Colloid&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of Hierarchically Porous Amorphous Catalyst for Durable Industrial&#8208;Scale Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A colloid&#8208;mediated electroless plating (CMEP) strategy is proposed to fabricate hierarchically porous, amorphous Fe&#8208;doped NiWB electrocatalysts under ambient conditions. The in situ formation of Fe&#8208;W&#8208;O colloidal species guides the formation of robust, porous catalyst layers with excellent mass transfer and durability, sustaining 500 mA cm&#8722;2 for 2000 h, showcasing a scalable, low&#8208;cost platform for industrial hydrogen production via AEM electrolysis.








ABSTRACT
Efficient and scalable hydrogen production via water electrolysis requires electrode architectures that combine high catalytic activity, effective active&#8208;site utilization, and mechanical durability at industrial current densities. However, conventional synthesis routes often produce dense, fragile catalyst layers that limit performance and scalability. Herein, a colloid&#8208;mediated electroless plating (CMEP) strategy is reported for the facile fabrication of hierarchically porous, amorphous Fe&#8208;NiWB electrodes under ambient conditions. During CMEP, the in situ generation of Fe&#8208;W&#8208;O colloids suppresses compact layer growth, yielding an open architecture with abundant accessible sites, accelerated mass transfer, and strong substrate anchoring. Comprehensive structural and electronic analyses reveal that Fe incorporation modulates the local coordination environment, enhances intrinsic activity, and promotes beneficial dynamic surface reconstruction under alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) conditions. The resulting electrode delivers excellent bifunctional activity and stability, sustaining 500 mA cm&#8722;2 for over 2000 h with negligible degradation in both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER/OER). When integrated into an anion exchange membrane (AEM) electrolyzer, it delivers 500 mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.55 V with remarkable long&#8208;term durability. A preliminary techno&#8208;economic analysis (TEA) highlights the scalability and cost competitiveness of this approach, underscoring its promise for economically viable large&#8208;scale green hydrogen production.

         <title>Buried Interface Chelating Molecular Bridge Strategy Enables Highly Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2,5&#8208;thienedicarboxylic acid (TDCA) with dual bonding sites is used as interfacial connecting bridge to fill the voids between Me&#8208;4PACz molecules to form a denser HSL. Furthermore, the C&#9552;O groups and S atom in TDCA can chelate with uncoordinated Pb2+ in perovskite, effectively passivating buried interface defects. Consequently, the PSCs based on TDCA interface layer achieved a champion PCE of 26.15%.








ABSTRACT
[4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9yl)butyl]phosphonic acid (Me&#8208;4PACz) self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) as hole&#8208;transport layers (HTLs) have enabled remarkable performance in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the uneven coverage and terminal carbazole groups of Me&#8208;4PACz SAMs cannot effectively passivate defects, which constrains further improvements in device performance. Herein, we use post&#8208;assembled chelating molecular bridge strategy to introduce 2,5&#8208;thiophenedicarboxylic acid (TDCA) as interface layer between Me&#8208;4PACz HTL and perovskite layer, which not only ensures the priority deposition of the primary Me&#8208;4PACz SAM, but also fills voids within the Me&#8208;4PACz HTL to form dense and uniform bilayer HTL. In addition, the C&#9552;O groups and S atom in TDCA can chelate with uncoordinated Pb2+ in perovskite, effectively passivating buried interface defects. Consequently, the PSCs based on TDCA interface layer achieved a champion PCE of 26.15%. It is noteworthy that this strategy has excellent process compatibility. The PCE of narrow&#8208;bandgap (1.55&#160;eV) and wide&#8208;bandgap (1.77&#160;eV) PSCs are 26.20% and 21.65%, respectively. Furthermore, the corresponding PSCs maintain more than 94.2% and 90.7% of initial efficiency after 2500&#160;h in a glove box and 1000&#160;h under one&#8208;sun illumination, respectively. This work provides a promising buried interface molecular bridge strategy for high&#8208;performance PSCs.

         <title>Selectively Breaking Bicontinuous Microphase Confinement for Sustainable and Unprecedented Superlubricating Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust hydrogel has been developed through strategies of microphase confinement enhancement and selectively breaking microphase confinement. It exhibits both outstanding mechanical properties and an extremely low coefficient of friction, demonstrating excellent load&#8208;bearing capacity, long&#8208;term lubrication performance, and closed&#8208;loop recyclability. This material provides an innovative and sustainable solution for lubrication systems under extreme conditions.








ABSTRACT
Conventional lubricating hydrogels struggle to simultaneously achieve excellent mechanical strength and interfacial lubrication due to the bulk and surface homogeneity. To address this, we developed a hydrogel with superior lubrication and load&#8208;bearing performance by selectively breaking bicontinuous microphase confinement on the hydrogel surface, in which the hydrogen&#8208;bond association within the microphase is dissociated to release the confined polymer chains. The bicontinuous matrix acts as the load&#8208;bearing phase, utilizing its percolated hydrophilic/hydrophobic microphase interfaces for dissipation (elastic modulus &#8764;417&#160;MPa). The broken microphases form a brush&#8208;like lubricating layer with strong hydration and entropic repulsion (coefficient of friction &#8764;0.0029). This structure effectively reduces shear stress and blunts friction cracks to improve wear resistance, and the percolated hydrophilic phase maintains sustainable lubrication via self&#8208;regeneration (coefficient of friction &#8764;0.0034, 50 N load, 100k cycles). This system also exhibits a closed&#8208;loop recycling, retaining 98.5% of its friction&#8208;reducing capabilities even after 100 cycles of reuse. Among reported lubricating hydrogels, this system achieves the lowest coefficient of friction with the highest modulus. This strategy provides a sustainable, innovative solution for lubrication systems under extreme conditions.

         <title>MOF&#8208;Functionalized Ultrasound&#8208;Trackable Magnetic Microrobots for Intracranial Toxin Removal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We design and prepare ultrasound&#8208;trackable microbubbles@PCN&#8208;333 microrobots for intracranial toxin clearance. These microrobots combine a hollow microbubble core for enhanced ultrasound contrast, a metal&#8211;organic framework shell efficient for high&#8208;capacity bilirubin adsorption, and magnetic nanoparticles for promoted navigation and mass transfer. This approach enables real&#8208;time tracking and efficient toxin removal in, e.g., cerebrospinal fluid.








ABSTRACT
Toxin accumulation within specialized microenvironments, such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), poses significant clinical challenges. In particular, bilirubin in CSF can cause severe damage to the brain and neural tissues. Current therapeutic strategies for intracranial bilirubin clearance suffer from poor targeting, inadequate detoxification capacity, and reliance on invasive procedures. Here, we demonstrate multifunctional microrobots designed for toxin removal in specialized anatomical compartments. The proposed ultrasound&#8208;trackable microbubbles@PCN&#8208;333 microrobots (UMPCs) feature a hollow hydrogel microbubble core for enhanced ultrasound imaging contrast, an outer metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) layer for proactive and high&#8208;capacity toxin adsorption, and embedded ferroferric oxide (Fe3O4) nanoparticles to enablec. Magnetic actuation enhances the UMPC's bilirubin capture efficiency through improved mass transfer. By integrating an ultrafast ultrasound imaging system with magnetic actuation, we achieve real&#8208;time tracking and precise control of UMPCs within the CSF. This strategy offers a minimally invasive and actively guided approach for efficient intracranial bilirubin clearance, opening new avenues for targeted toxin&#8208;removal in anatomically confined environments.

         <title>Gradient&#8208;Heterojunction in Solid Electrolytes for Fast&#8208;Charging Dendrite&#8208;Free Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research focuses on addressing uncontrollable lithium dendrite formation and inadequate ion transport in SLMBs by designing PTLT&#8208;H, a gradient&#8208;engineered CSE. It integrates LTO (Li2TiO3/Li4Ti5O12) heterojunctions into a polymer matrix under a Direct Current electric field, where the gradient distribution of LTO creates a graded IEF to optimize Li&#8314; migration dynamics and electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces.








ABSTRACT
Solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs) employing thin polymer electrolytes and lithium (Li) metal anodes are regarded as promising next&#8208;generation energy storage systems due to their potential to deliver high energy density with enhanced safety. However, their practical application is impeded by the inherently low ionic conductivity of polymer electrolytes and the uncontrollable growth of Li dendrites. Herein, we design a composite electrolyte with enhanced ionic conductivity and dendrite suppression by introducing gradient Li2TiO3/Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) heterojunction fillers. The heterojunction, formed through lattice mismatch, generates a built&#8208;in electric field (IEF) that promotes Li salt dissociation and forms continuous ion&#8208;conduction pathways, thereby enhancing ionic conductivity to 0.83 mS cm&#8722;1 at room temperature. Furthermore, under an external field, the charged LTO particles redistribute directionally, producing a gradient structure with higher concentration near the Li side. This gradient IEF ensures uniform Li&#8314; flux at the Li&#8208;electrolyte interface, while the reinforced mechanical strength effectively blocks dendrite propagation. Consequently, symmetric Li||Li cells with PTLT&#8208;H demonstrate stable cycling for over 1000&#160;h at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 (1 mAh cm&#8722;2). Moreover, PTLT&#8208;H enables SSBs with excellent long&#8208;term performance, achieving 94.6% capacity retention after 5000 cycles at 5C. This study highlights gradient IEF engineering as a viable approach to achieving both high conductivity and interfacial stability in fast&#8208;charging dendrite&#8208;free SSBs.

         <title>Universal Conductance Fluctuations in Quantum Anomalous Hall Insulators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Universal conductance fluctuations are observed in mesoscopic quantum anomalous Hall insulators. Two distinct fluctuation patterns are identified, arising from different interference processes of bulk and chiral edge states, respectively. These findings unveil rich quantum interference phenomena in quantum anomalous Hall insulators and provide insights essential for the development of quantum anomalous Hall&#8208;based electronics.








ABSTRACT
Universal conductance fluctuations (UCF) are a distinctive mesoscopic transport phenomenon that arises in disordered systems when the sample size approaches the phase coherence length of the system. As a hallmark of phase coherent transport, UCF shapes the low temperature transport properties of such systems in a fundamental way. In this study, UCF are reported in magnetically doped topological insulator thin films in the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) regime. In mesoscopic QAH devices, aperiodic yet highly reproducible conductance fluctuations are observed, robust against variations in field sweeping direction and temperature. Two fluctuation components with distinct characteristic frequencies are revealed, and their contrasting temperature dependencies indicate that they originate from different interference processes associated with bulk and edge states, respectively. These finding uncovers rich quantum interference phenomena in the QAH insulators, providing new insights into mesoscopic transport in QAH systems.

         <title>Spatially Ordered Dual&#8208;Atom Nanozymes for Mimicking Substrate&#8208;Induced Conformational Locking in Natural Enzymes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spatially ordered Fe&#8208;Pd dual&#8208;atom nanozyme (o&#8208;FePd DAN) emulates the substrate&#8208;induced conformational locking (SCL) of natural metalloenzymes through dynamic electron coupling within Cl&#8208;FeN3C&#8208;PdN3 sites. Operando XAFS and DFT reveal a bridged&#8208;structure&#8208;driven charge&#8208;transfer pathway that effectively facilitates adaptive modulation and selective catalysis, which is further applied to a visual genotyping platform for POCT of HPV.








ABSTRACT
Natural metalloenzymes achieve exceptional catalytic efficiency and specificity through substrate&#8208;induced conformational locking (SCL) across bimetallic sites. However, most nanozymes lack such adaptive microenvironments and dynamic regulatory capabilities. We reported a spatially ordered bimetallic nanozyme, o&#8208;FePd DAN, with a Cl&#8208;FeN3C&#8208;PdN3 catalytic center that emulated the SCL mechanism through directional electron transfer (DET) and axial microenvironment reconfiguration. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations showed that the Fe&#8208;Pd configuration provides optimal H2O2 adsorption, the lowest O&#8208;O dissociation energy, and enhanced activation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Meanwhile, operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy reveals the formation of a bridged structure at the bimetallic site during catalysis, establishing a dynamic charge&#8208;transfer pathway that switches the dominant reaction from ROS&#8208;mediated oxidation to a DET process driven by the bridged structure. This adaptive electron modulation arises from d&#8208;orbital hybridization and the emergence of new active states near the Fermi level in the Cl&#8208;FeN3C&#8208;PdN3 site. Furthermore, o&#8208;FePd DAN is integrated into a three&#8208;channel visual origami sensing (Tc&#8208;VOS) platform for multichannel genotyping of human papillomavirus (HPV) subtypes. This work demonstrates a strategy for constructing spatially ordered bimetallic DANs that reproduce the SCL effect of natural enzymes and establish a dynamic, conformationally adaptive catalytic mechanism for nanozyme design.

         <title>Ultrahigh Energy&#8208;Storage Multilayer Ceramic Capacitors with Low Sintering Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and efficient design of high&#8208;entropy 1/3BiFeO3&#8208;1/3BaTiO3&#8208;1/3Ca0.5Sr0.5TiO3 ceramics with three different sintering aids (CuO, MgO, MnO2) is proposed. Benefiting from the synergistic effects, a high Ue of 17.9 J cm&#8722;3 with an ultrahigh &#951; of 94.4 % in BFBCST&#8208;MnO2 MLCCs is achieved, and also shows good temperature stability (20&#8208;160 &#176;C) and cycling reliability (&gt;107 cycles), which remarkably outperform those state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art MLCCs.








ABSTRACT
Multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs) with ultrahigh power density are fundamental components in the modern electronics industry. However, the relatively low energy density or/and efficiency are still limited by high conduction losses and hysteresis loss. To address these issues, we propose a simple and efficient design in high&#8208;entropy 1/3BiFeO3&#8208;1/3BaTiO3&#8208;1/3Ca0.5Sr0.5TiO3 ceramics (abbreviated as BFBCST) through three different sintering aids (CuO, MgO, MnO2). With optimized sintering aids, the optimal sintering temperature is reduced by 150 to 975&#176;C. Meanwhile, the synergistic strategy effectively minimizes hysteresis loss by lowering the domain switching barriers and decreases conduction losses by suppressing the volatilization of Bi3+ and minimizing valence variations of Fe3+ and Ti4+. Therefore, an ultrahigh energy storage density of 17.9 J cm&#8722;3 with a high efficiency of 94.4% is simultaneously achieved under an electric field of 905&#160;kV cm&#8722;1 in BFBCST&#8208;based MLCCs with MnO2 sintering aid.

Benefiting from the synergistic effects, a high &lt;i&gt;U&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; of 17.9 J cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; with an ultrahigh &lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt; of 94.4 % in BFBCST-MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; MLCCs is achieved, and also shows good temperature stability (20-160 &#176;C) and cycling reliability (&amp;gt;10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; cycles), which remarkably outperform those state-of-the-art MLCCs.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs) with ultrahigh power density are fundamental components in the modern electronics industry. However, the relatively low energy density or/and efficiency are still limited by high conduction losses and hysteresis loss. To address these issues, we propose a simple and efficient design in high-entropy 1/3BiFeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-1/3BaTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-1/3Ca&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Sr&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;TiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ceramics (abbreviated as BFBCST) through three different sintering aids (CuO, MgO, MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). With optimized sintering aids, the optimal sintering temperature is reduced by 150 to 975&#176;C. Meanwhile, the synergistic strategy effectively minimizes hysteresis loss by lowering the domain switching barriers and decreases conduction losses by suppressing the volatilization of Bi&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and minimizing valence variations of Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and Ti&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;. Therefore, an ultrahigh energy storage density of 17.9 J cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; with a high efficiency of 94.4% is simultaneously achieved under an electric field of 905&#160;kV cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in BFBCST-based MLCCs with MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sintering aid. This approach should be universally applicable to designing high-performance dielectrics, which holds promise for extensive applications in MLCCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dimeric Acceptors Featuring an Electron&#8208;Rich Fused&#8208;Ring Linker Enable High&#8208;Efficiency and Stable Organic Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report two novel dimerized small&#8208;molecule acceptors for ternary organic solar cells. The optimized device achieves a high power conversion efficiency of 20.26 % and demonstrates exceptional operational stability, retaining over 86 % of initial PCE after 1430 h under high humidity. A 15.6 cm2 module also shows 17.63 % efficiency, proving the strategy's scalability for high&#8208;performance OSCs.








ABSTRACT
Organic solar cells (OSCs) are a promising renewable energy technology; however, balancing the power conversion efficiency (PCE) with long&#8208;term stability remains challenging. Herein, we report two novel dimerized small&#8208;molecule acceptors (DSMAs), GSNS&#8208;EH and GSNS&#8208;C8, that feature electron&#8208;rich planar pyrrolodithiophene bridges with tailored side chains. The optimized acceptor, GSNS&#8208;EH, with a branched 2&#8208;ethylhexyl chain, exhibited enhanced crystallinity and molecular ordering, reduced non&#8208;radiative losses, and improved blend morphology when incorporated into the PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 host system as a third component. The resulting ternary OSC exhibited a PCE of 20.26 %, which is among the highest values reported for DSMA&#8208;based ternary devices. Moreover, the GSNS&#8208;EH&#8208;based cell exhibited exceptional operational stability, maintaining 86.7 % of its initial PCE after 1430&#160;h of maximum power point tracking under high humidity (85 % &#177; 10 %) and 97.2 % after 1460&#160;h at 85&#176;C. The excellent scalability of this approach is demonstrated by a 15.6 cm2 module achieving a high PCE of 17.63 %. Thus, this study provides an effective molecular design strategy toward highly efficient, stable, and scalable OSCs.

         <title>Tuning Pore Size in Porous Graphene Membrane for O2/N2 Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;layer graphene membranes featuring N&#8208;functionalized, 0D pores offer a promising platform for O2/N2 separation. The heterogeneity of functional groups at the pore edge is dynamically tunable, enabling precise tuning of the pore limiting diameter and gas transport. This strategy achieves attractive performance, with O2 permeance approaching 2500 GPU and O2/N2 selectivity exceeding 10, highlighting the potential for energy&#8208;efficient air separation.








ABSTRACT
Graphene with angstrom&#8208;scale, zero&#8208;dimensional pores offers a promising platform for gas separations due to its exceptional permeance and potential for molecular sieving. Herein, we demonstrate a dynamic strategy to tune N&#8208;functionalized graphene pores, achieving selective oxygen (O2) separation from nitrogen (N2), a particularly challenging separation due to their similar kinetic diameters. We exploit the heterogeneity of functional groups at the pore edge to tune the pore limiting diameter (PLD). By facile thermal annealing, we convert primary amine groups at the pore edge to lattice&#8208;incorporated nitrogen. Temperature&#8208;dependent extent of conversion allows to tune the steric hindrance from amine&#8208;CO2 complex, and therefore, PLD for O2/N2 separation in favor of O2 permeation. The resulting membranes exhibit attractive O2/N2 separation performance, with O2 permeance near 2500 GPU with O2/N2 selectivity above 10, significantly outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes. This is attractive for energy&#8208;efficient and modular production of O2 from air and can cut down fuel consumption in natural gas&#8208;fired furnaces in the chemical industry by 60%.

         <title>Scalable All&#8208;Polymer Photonic Crystals for Daytime Radiative Cooling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work developed a scalable all&#8208;polymer photonic crystal film via the gradient nanolayer coextrusion and biaxial stretching, achieving high solar reflectance, strong infrared emissivity, and superior mechanical robustness, bridging nanophotonic design and industrial production of sustainable radiative coolers.








ABSTRACT
Photonic crystals hold significant promise for passive daytime radiative cooling (PDRC) yet face inherent scalability&#8211;durability&#8211;performance trade&#8208;offs. Although all&#8208;polymer photonic crystals (APPCs) offer solutions, their development is constrained by limited refractive index contrasts (&#916;n &lt; 0.2), sub&#8208;100&#8208;nm layer fabrication challenges, interfacial delamination, and insufficient mechanical robustness. Here, we fabricated a scalable, high&#8208;performance all&#8208;polymer photonic crystal film via the self&#8208;assembled gradient nanolayer coextrusion of poly(methyl methacrylate) and poly(ethylene naphthalate), followed by biaxial stretching. The resulting 1500&#8208;layer hierarchical architecture, featuring gradient layer thicknesses ranging from 50 to 400&#160;nm, achieved a solar reflectance of 95.4% and mid&#8208;infrared emissivity of 93.4%, enabling sub&#8208;ambient cooling of 11&#176;C under 980&#160;W/m2 solar irradiance. The dense nanolayer structure also imparted exceptional mechanical properties, including a tensile strength of &#8764;103.8&#160;mPa, toughness of &#8764;54.9&#160;mJ/m3, and Young's modulus of &#8764;2.9&#160;GPa, substantially exceeding those of existing polymer&#8208;based radiative coolers. This solvent&#8208;free, continuous fabrication process bridged nanophotonic design with industrial&#8208;scale manufacturing, offering a practical fabrication route for durable, high&#8208;performance polymeric cooling films.

         <title>Dual Magnetic Resonances From Site&#8208;Selective Doping of Hexaferrite Yielding Ultrabroadband Microwave Absorption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A magnetic&#8208;resonance&#8208;tunable hexaferrite is designed by doping two rare&#8208;earth ions (Sc3+ and Yb3+). Due to their site&#8208;selective occupancy and the emergence of dual resonance behavior&#8212;originating from anisotropy field suppression, this material achieves excellent absorption bandwidth in the single&#8208;phase platform.








ABSTRACT
The proliferation of 5G/6G networks and high&#8211;frequency electronics has intensifies the demand for ultrabroadband microwave absorbers, while achieving such performance in a single&#8211;phase magnetic material remains challenging due to intrinsic resonance&#8211;bandwidth limits. Herein, we report a crystallographic&#8211;site&#8211;selective rare&#8208;earth ions co&#8208;doping strategy to engineer magnetocrystalline anisotropy in M&#8211;type BaFe12O19 (BaM) hexaferrites. By precisely substituting Sc3+ and Yb3+ into the anisotropy&#8211;critical 4f2, 2a, and 12k sublattices&#8212;confirmed via neutron powder diffraction, X&#8211;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy, and density functional theory&#8212;the uniaxial anisotropy field is orthogonally suppressed, activating dual ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) modes. This dual resonance behavior broadens magnetic loss dispersion, redshifts natural resonance frequency, and simultaneously improves impedance matching. The optimized Ba1.08Fe10.8Yb0.2Sc1.0O19 composition achieves an ultra&#8208;wide effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) of 9.02 GHz (2.01 mm thickness). This study establishes an intrinsic, rare&#8211;earth&#8211;enabled design paradigm for scalable, high&#8211;performance microwave absorbers, with direct implications for electromagnetic interference suppression, stealth coatings, and next&#8211;generation wireless communication technologies.

Herein, we report a crystallographic&#8211;site&#8211;selective rare-earth ions co-doping strategy to engineer magnetocrystalline anisotropy in M&#8211;type BaFe&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt; (BaM) hexaferrites. By precisely substituting Sc&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and Yb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; into the anisotropy&#8211;critical 4f&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 2a, and 12k sublattices&#8212;confirmed via neutron powder diffraction, X&#8211;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy, and density functional theory&#8212;the uniaxial anisotropy field is orthogonally suppressed, activating dual ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) modes. This dual resonance behavior broadens magnetic loss dispersion, redshifts natural resonance frequency, and simultaneously improves impedance matching. The optimized Ba&lt;sub&gt;1.08&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;10.8&lt;/sub&gt;Yb&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Sc&lt;sub&gt;1.0&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt; composition achieves an ultra-wide effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) of 9.02 GHz (2.01 mm thickness). This study establishes an intrinsic, rare&#8211;earth&#8211;enabled design paradigm for scalable, high&#8211;performance microwave absorbers, with direct implications for electromagnetic interference suppression, stealth coatings, and next&#8211;generation wireless communication technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hybrid Liquid Metal Cathode Enables High&#8208;Performance Intrinsically Stretchable OLEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a hybrid liquid metal (Hyb&#8208;LM) cathode engineered via selective rupture of liquid metal particles (LMPs), forming a bilayer architecture with a surface liquid metal (LM) layer and underlying LMP layer, which has benefits of both LM and LMPs. This cathode simultaneously exhibits low sheet resistance, high reflectance, and low work function, enabling intrinsically stretchable organic light&#8208;emitting diodes with the lowest turn&#8208;on voltage of 3 V, record&#8208;high maximum luminance of 17 670 cd m&#8722;2, and current efficiency of 10.35 cd A&#8722;1. The Hyb&#8208;LM design uniquely combines processability, electromechanical robustness, and high&#8208;resolution patternability, advancing stretchable optoelectronics toward next&#8208;generation displays and biomedical integration.








ABSTRACT
Intrinsically stretchable light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) are essential for next&#8208;generation wearable and implantable optoelectronics. However, achieving high&#8208;performance in intrinsically stretchable LEDs remains elusive due to the absence of a stretchable cathode that concurrently ensures efficient electron injection, mechanical compliance, and high optical reflectance. Here, we introduce a hybrid liquid metal&#8212;liquid metal particle (Hyb&#8208;LM) cathode, engineered by selective rupture of surface liquid metal particles (LMPs), which facilitates their transformation into a continuous liquid metal (LM) layer. The resulting bilayer structure, comprising a surface LM layer and an underlying LMP layer, exhibits an exceptional combination of low work function (&#8764;4.1&#160;eV), high reflectance (&#8764;90%), low sheet resistance (2.70 &#215; 10&#8722;2 &#937; sq&#8722;1), and negligible resistance changes under 150% strain (R/R0 = 1.03 at 150% strain), overcoming fundamental limitations in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art stretchable cathodes. The Hyb&#8208;LM cathode enables the realization of intrinsically stretchable organic LEDs with a low turn&#8208;on voltage of 3.0&#160;V, a maximum luminance of 17 670&#160;cd m&#8722;2, and a record&#8208;high current efficiency of 10.35&#160;cd A&#8722;1, representing a critical advancement toward stretchable displays and implantable optoelectronics.

         <title>Bioinspired Heat&#8208;Induced Viscoelasticity&#8208;Switchable Electrodes for Conformal Brain&#8208;Computer Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired thermally induced viscoelasticity&#8208;switchable interface enables conformal contact on hairy scalps and user&#8208;friendly operation in wearable brain&#8208;computer interface systems. Autonomous conformal interfacing is achieved by coupling a thermoresponsive gel with in situ thermal control.








ABSTRACT
Electroencephalography is a promising noninvasive modality for brain&#8208;computer interfaces (BCIs), yet its widespread adoption is constrained by electrode limitations: dry electrodes yield unstable signals, whereas wet electrodes require laborious setup and are ill&#8208;suited to wearable devices. Inspired by honeybees that locally heat beeswax to reversibly switch it between rigid and moldable states for comb construction, this work introduces a heat&#8208;induced viscoelasticity&#8208;switchable electrode (HIVE) that enables conformal contact on hairy scalps and user&#8208;friendly operation in wearable systems. HIVE integrates a thermoresponsive gelatin gel confined in a sponge matrix with an on&#8208;electrode microheater. Its temperature is actively modulated on demand, enabling autonomous switching between the gel and sol states. As a flowable sol, it permeates hair, conforms to the skin. At body temperature, it remains in a viscoelastic state, providing strong adhesion. Moreover, heating duration is closed&#8208;loop controlled using real&#8208;time electrode&#8208;skin impedance. In steady&#8208;state visual evoked potential paradigm, HIVE delivers high classification accuracy comparable to gold&#8208;standard wet electrodes while supporting wearable BCI devices for vision&#8208;based wheelchair navigation and high&#8208;speed text entry. By translating honeybee viscoelasticity&#8208;modulation strategy into bioelectronic interfaces, this work provides a practical solution for wearable BCI devices and a new design paradigm for conformal biointerfaces on hairy or piliferous surfaces.

         <title>Dimensionality&#8208;Driven Metal&#8208;to&#8208;Insulator Transition in Two&#8208;Dimensional Antiferromagnetic R&#8208;Cr2Se3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reducing the dimensionality of r&#8208;Cr2Se3 induces a robust metal&#8208;to&#8208;insulator transition (MIT) without degrading its antiferromagnetic ordering. These findings resolve long&#8208;standing ambiguities surrounding the intrinsic electronic and magnetic characters of r&#8208;Cr2Se3 in the literature and establish dimensionality&#8208;driven MIT as a viable and generalizable strategy for realizing robust magnetic semiconductors.








ABSTRACT
The integration of magnetism and semiconductivity in a single material remains a central challenge in condensed matter physics, as conventional approaches struggle to reconcile the competing requirements of a finite bandgap and robust magnetic ordering. Here, we report a complementary strategy that inverts the traditional design logic: starting from a magnetic metal, we induce a controlled metal&#8208;to&#8208;insulator transition (MIT) through dimensionality reduction in two&#8208;dimensional (2D) layers. Using rhombohedral (r&#8208;)Cr2Se3 as a model system, we show that thinning from bulk to atomically thin nanosheets progressively opens a bandgap while preserving antiferromagnetic ordering. Transport measurements reveal a pronounced thickness&#8208;dependent crossover from metallic to semiconducting behavior, driven primarily by quantum confinement under dimensional reduction, while the effects of external magnetic and electric fields remain minor. Supported by first&#8208;principles calculations, our results establish r&#8208;Cr2Se3 as a rare non&#8208;van der Waals 2D antiferromagnetic semiconductor and illustrate that dimensionality&#8208;driven MIT offers a viable pathway for engineering robust 2D magnetic semiconductors, providing a new platform for spintronic and multifunctional device applications.

         <title>Supercoiled Superelastic Metallic Metamaterials for High Energy Density and Heavy&#8208;Duty Vibration Mitigation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
All&#8208;metallic supercoiled metamaterials achieve over 50% recoverable strain, triple buckling strength, and quadruple energy density over prismatic lattices. They enable advanced energy absorption, protective structures and vibration mitigation. The chiral quasi&#8208;zero&#8208;stiffness isolator sustains ultralow resonant frequencies (&#8804;2 Hz) while supporting 100&#8211;1000&#215; higher loads than existing schemes, also surpasses traditional springs&#8217; theoretical limits.








ABSTRACT
Metallic metamaterials that combine superelasticity, high energy density (enthalpy), and heavy load&#8208;bearing capacity have been long sought for applications in energy absorption, impact protection, and vibration control. However, achieving this combination remains elusive due to limitations of material strength and design paradigm. Here, inspired by DNA supercoiling, we report all&#8208;metallic metamaterials composed of helices that undergo hierarchical twist&#8208;buckling under compression. This supercoiled geometry synergistically enhances load resistance and energy storage while mitigating stress concentrations, enabling recoverable strains up to 50%, tripling the buckling strength and quadrupling the enthalpy of densely packed prismatic lattices. An accurate deep&#8208;buckling theory clarifies how global twist elevates strength and energy density, while local curvature ensures superelasticity. Using steel assemblies, we demonstrate robust cyclic superelasticity and create quasi&#8208;zero&#8208;stiffness isolators that maintain ultralow resonance frequency (f0 &#8804; 2&#160;Hz) while supporting 100&#8211;1000&#215; higher loads than existing designs, bridging the critical gap between high load capacity and low&#8208;frequency isolation, and breaking through the theoretical limit of conventional springs. Our work establishes a general, scalable and manufacturable principle for superelastic metallic metamaterials, opening new pathways for advanced applications in vibration mitigation, energy absorption, and protective structures.

         <title>Dynamic Reversible Full&#8208;Color&#160;Phosphorescence Afterglows from Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Carboxymethyl Chitosan Based Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Marine&#8208;derived carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS, n&#8208;electron&#8208;system) with a record 10.1% p&#8208;RTP efficiency hosts trace (0.1 wt%) pyrenedicarboxylate acid sodium salts (PDA, &#960;&#8208;electron&#8208;system). Driven by n&#8208;&#960; synergy via through&#8208;space conjugation, it affords dynamically reversible full&#8208;color p&#8208;RTP afterglows with multi&#8208;stimuli (pH, td, &#955;ex) responsiveness, empowering anti&#8208;counterfeiting, encryption, information storage, sensing, and phosphorescent textiles.








ABSTRACT
Pure organic stimuli&#8208;responsive persistent room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (p&#8208;RTP) materials hold significant promise for encryption, bioimaging, sensing, and wearable optoelectronics. However, developing highly efficient smart p&#8208;RTP systems featuring full&#8208;color tunability and multi&#8208;dimensional reversible responsiveness remains a long&#8208;standing challenge, especially for nonconventional luminophores lacking significant conjugation. Herein, it is found that marine&#8208;derived carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS) exhibits intrinsic excitation&#8208;tunable panchromatic (400&#8211;610&#160;nm) photoluminescence (PL) and a record&#8208;high p&#8208;RTP quantum yield of 10.1% amongst nonconventional polymeric luminophores. Leveraging its outstanding PL, rigid conformation, and, moreover, inherent amino/carboxyl groups, we further construct a pyrenedicarboxylic acid salt&#8208;doped phosphorescence system that demonstrates efficient (8.8%), prolonged (515.1&#160;ms), and dynamically tunable (495&#8211;710&#160;nm) p&#8208;RTP with cyclable control via pH, delay time (td), and excitation wavelength (&#955;ex). Moving beyond conventional aromatic structural modification strategies, this work achieves multimode stimuli&#8208;responsive and efficient p&#8208;RTP through the synergy between nonaromatic CMCS and aromatic chromophores, and the effective control of their intra/intermolecular interactions, chain conformation, and consequent dye aggregation, enabling versatile applications across anti&#8208;counterfeiting, encryption, information storage, and phosphorescent textiles.

         <title>Flexible Multiband Photonic Synapses for Nociceptive Perception and Neuromorphic Computation via Fluorinated InP Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully solution&#8208;processed and self&#8208;supporting flexible transparent photonic synaptic transistor based on eco&#8208;friendly InP&#8208;based QDs modified with novel fluorinated thiol ligands is presented. These devices exhibit an ultralow energy consumption of 0.016 fJ per operation. Moreover, they are capable of emulating prioritized information processing in the brain, simulating corneal damage under weak ultraviolet (UV) light exposure, and performing target recognition tasks. This work highlights new insights into designing high&#8208;performance and low&#8208;power visual perception systems.








ABSTRACT
Organic photonic synaptic transistors (OPSTs), emulating biological synaptic behaviors under optical stimulation, serve as essential hardware components for neuromorphic visual systems. To satisfy various demands, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art OPSTs typically require multispectral responsiveness that is often pursued by leveraging the excellent optoelectronic properties and solution&#8208;processability of quantum dots (QDs). However, this strategy suffers from complex fabrication procedures, limited mechanical flexibility and toxic cadmium/lead compositions in QDs, which raise serious environmental and biosafety concerns. In this work, we demonstrate a fully solution&#8208;processed and self&#8208;supporting flexible OPST based on environmentally benign indium phosphide (InP) QDs. Through ligand exchange with fluorinated thiols, the QDs demonstrate improved photostability and enhanced energy level alignment with organic semiconductors. Furthermore, the interfacial dipole induced by fluorinated ligands enables long&#8208;term charge retention. The resulting QD&#8208;OPST devices exhibit broadband excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) responses, tunable synaptic plasticity, remarkable mechanical durability and ultralow energy consumption of 0.016 fJ, effectively mimicking cornea&#8208;like nociceptor behaviors. In addition, the QD&#8208;OPSTs display pronounced color selectivity, enabling blue&#8208;feature recognition while suppressing red&#8208;green background noise. This study provides a feasible strategy for developing high&#8208;performance, eco&#8208;friendly, and flexible photonic synapse devices, highlighting great potential for applications in visual perception and brain&#8208;inspired computing.

         <title>Guanidyl&#8208;Engineered SAMs with Electrostatic&#8211;Coordination Synergy for High&#8208;Efficiency Tandem&#8208;Compatible Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A guanidyl&#8208;engineered SAM strategy is developed to establish electrostatic&#8211;coordination synergy, effectively suppressing SAM aggregation, optimizing energy&#8208;level alignment, and passivating buried interface defects. This approach enables record efficiencies in wide&#8208;bandgap single&#8208;junction perovskite solar cells and laminated perovskite/silicon tandems, with exceptional operational stability. By resolving key interfacial challenges, this work offers a practical route toward scalable, durable, and high&#8208;efficiency tandem photovoltaics for sustainable energy applications.








ABSTRACT
Wide&#8208;bandgap inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted significant interest owing to their excellent stability feature and unique compatibility with tandem device architectures. However, two major challenges remain: the inhomogeneity of self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) and the insufficient passivation of buried interface defects. In this study, we introduce polyhexamethylene guanidine hydrochloride (PHMG) as an additive to 4&#8208;(7H&#8208;dibenzo[c,g]carbazole&#8208;7&#8208;yl) phosphonic acid (4PADCB) SAMs, wherein guanidyl groups in PHMG establish electrostatic&#8211;coordination synergy with 4PADCB and perovskite species, respectively. The electrostatic interaction suppresses SAM aggregation, reduces interfacial defects, and optimizes energy&#8208;level alignment at the SAM/perovskite interface, while the coordination effect promotes perovskite crystallization, enlarges grains, reduces defect densities, and relaxes interface stress. Consequently, the optimized 1.68&#160;eV&#8208;bandgap PSC delivers a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.62%, representing the highest value reported to date, with over 95% efficiency retention after 1300&#160;h of thermal aging at 85&#176;C in N2. Furthermore, these PSCs are integrated into perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells, achieving a record PCE of 32.49% for a laminated tandem device and the superior values of 32.25% (with an active area of 1 cm2) and 29.34% (with an active area of 20 cm2) for monolithic tandem devices.

         <title>Proximity&#8208;Driven Non&#8208;Volatile Spin and Valley Control in a Van Der Waals Antiferromagnetic Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates non&#8208;volatile spin and valley control in a van der Waals heterostructure of monolayer MoSe2 and bulk antiferromagnetic CrPS4, via interfacial spin&#8208;polarized charge transfer. Persistent chiral photoluminescence and hysteresis are achieved at a switching field 17 times lower than the bulk spin&#8208;flip field of CrPS4, enabling low&#8208;energy, magnetically tunable quantum devices.








ABSTRACT
The integration of non&#8208;volatile spin and valley control in 2D quantum systems remains a pivotal challenge for spintronic and valleytronic functionalities. Here, we demonstrate persistent spin and valley polarizations in a van der Waals heterostructure comprising bulk antiferromagnetic CrPS4 and monolayer MoSe2, achieved via interfacial magnetic proximity effects. The 1L&#8208;MoSe2/bulk&#8208;CrPS4 heterostructure exhibits non&#8208;volatile hysteresis in chiral photoluminescence (PL), directly linked to the antiferromagnetic ordering of bulk&#8208;CrPS4. This helicity of PL persists at zero field, enabled by the spin&#8208;polarized charge transfer from the K valley in the MoSe2 monolayer to the conduction band of CrPS4, breaking the valley degeneracy without external stimuli. Remarkably, the PL helicity switches surprisingly at a magnetic field of &#8764; 0.5 T, a 17&#8208;fold smaller than the spin&#8208;flip field of &#8764;8.5 T in bulk CrPS4. Our work establishes bulk antiferromagnet&#8208;based heterostructure as a robust platform for low&#8208;energy, magnetically tunable quantum devices, bridging the gap between the transient valleytronic phenomena and practical non&#8208;volatile applications.

         <title>Highly Efficient and Stable All&#8208;Weather Moisture Power Generation via Asymmetric Structured Color Photothermal Evaporation&#8208;Induced Cotton Fabrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photothermal evaporation&#8208;driven moisture power generator (PEMG) constructs an asymmetric photothermal gradient to harvest moisture energy by forming a PDA&#8208;structured colored film on fabric. This structure prevents moisture adsorption saturation and excessive evaporation, thereby maintaining a stable humidity gradient. The PEMG enables continuous power generation in all&#8208;weather, providing stable electricity for wearable electronic devices.








ABSTRACT
Harvesting electrical energy from the ubiquitous water cycle to power flexible electronic devices is receiving increasing attention. However, the development of moisture&#8208;driven generators with high and stable power output remains a significant challenge. Here, we design a photothermal evaporation&#8208;driven moisture generator (PEMG) that modifies a cotton fabric with in situ polymerized pyrrole by a polydopamine (PDA)&#8208;structured color film to form an asymmetric photothermal temperature gradient. The PDA asymmetric photothermal layer not only effectively addresses the issue of insufficient sustained power generation caused by water adsorption saturation but also mitigates the unstable moisture gradient resulting from excessive water evaporation. CF@PPy@PDA (purple) achieved an open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.74&#160;V and a short&#8208;circuit current (Isc) of 0.72&#160;mA under 60% relative humidity (RH) and 1&#8208;sun illumination, respectively. White LED bulbs emit a steady stream of light for more than 24 h. Moreover, the Voc of the PEMG (six units in series) reaches 1.18&#160;V at an average solar intensity of 1000&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;2 and 43% RH, while the Voc is 0.72&#160;V at night (52% RH). Meanwhile, wearable systems designed with integrated PEMG units provide sufficient power supply for electronic devices under natural conditions.

         <title>Precision&#8208;Engineered Electronic Modulation of Ruthenium Clusters and Single Atoms on Vacancy&#8208;Rich &#945;&#8208;MoC1&#8208;x Enables Efficient Electrocatalytic Water Splitting</title>

         <dc:description>
The different local interfacial charge polarizations of Ru clusters and Ru single atoms incorporated with &#945;&#8208;MoC1&#8208;x/C lead to exceptional electrocatalytic performances for alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction. DFT calculations combined with in situ characterizations reveal that the dual excitation of Ru individual atoms and &#945;&#8208;MoC1&#8208;x weakens the binding strength of H* to Ru clusters, thereby optimizing the adsorption/desorption energy of intermediates and accelerating reaction dynamics of HER.








ABSTRACT
Maximizing the utilization of active metals while maintaining efficient catalytic activity is of great importance for electrocatalytic alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction. Herein, we report a facile pyrolysis strategy to anchor Ru clusters and adjacent Ru single atoms on &#945;&#8208;MoC1&#8208;x coated carbon nanospheres (termed as RuCS/SA/&#945;&#8208;MoC1&#8208;x/C). Theoretical calculations combined with in situ characterizations reveal that an electron&#8208;bridging mechanism whereby Ru single atoms donate electrons to the defective &#945;&#8208;MoC1&#8208;x, which subsequently transfers electron to Ru clusters, enabling a cooperative modulation of the electronic structure across different types of Ru sites. Therefore, the dual excitation of Ru single atoms and &#945;&#8208;MoC1&#8208;x weakens the binding strength between Ru clusters and H*, accelerates the desorption of H2. The as&#8208;obtained 3%&#8208;RuCS/SA/&#945;&#8208;MoC1&#8208;x/C sample attains an excellent overpotential of 9&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 along with a mass activity of 20.38 A mg&#8722;1Ru (&#8208;100&#160;mV) and a turnover frequency of 1.71 H2 s&#8722;1 at 25&#160;mV, which is larger than those of 20% Pt/C. Moreover, Both the anion exchange membrane water electrolysis cells and Zn&#8211;H2O batteries employing 3%&#8208;RuCS/SA/&#945;&#8208;MoC1&#8208;x/C as the cathode electrocatalyst exhibit exceptional performance.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Exciplex White OLEDs for Natural&#8208;Quality Lighting and Optical Data Transmission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;exciplex backbone formed within a single neat PPCzTrz layer, combined with three ultrathin phosphorescent emitters, enables nondoped white OLEDs with natural&#8208;light&#8208;quality emission (CRI = 97, EQEmax = 27%) that also function as visible light communication transmitters.








ABSTRACT
The integration of high&#8208;quality organic solid&#8208;state lighting with high&#8208;speed optical wireless communication offers an innovative pathway toward next&#8208;generation optoelectronic devices. Here, we report a structurally simplified white organic light&#8208;emitting diode (WOLED) that achieves seamless integration of natural&#8208;light&#8208;quality illumination and visible light communication (VLC) using a unique dual&#8208;exciplex architecture. Central to this design is a versatile organic layer of PPCzTrz that serves as both an electron donor and acceptor at two distinct interfaces, establishing complementary charge&#8208;transport pathways and a voltage&#8208;controlled dynamic shift of the exciton recombination zone. This spatial redistribution balances blue and green exciplex emissions, while F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) sequentially funnels energy to strategically positioned green, orange, and red phosphorescent ultrathin layers. The resulting multi&#8208;path exciton management strategy ensures spectrally stable white light from 400 to 700&#160;nm, yielding a record&#8208;high color rendering index (CRI = 97), a peak external quantum efficiency of 27.0%, and a power efficiency of 85.8&#160;lm&#160;W&#8722;1. The same device enables high&#8208;speed VLC with a data rate of 14.0&#160;Mbps. This work provides a scalable and energy&#8208;efficient platform that simultaneously addresses the needs of high&#8208;quality lighting and optical data transmission, paving the way for smart lighting systems and fully organic integrated optoelectronics.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Nanoarchitectonics of Fluorescent Transparent Materials via Co&#8208;Assembling Non&#8208;Aromatic Amino Acids and Tetrafluorophthalic Acid for Adhesion, Coating, and Information Encryption Applications</title>

         <dc:description>
Employing a non&#8208;covalent strategy, non&#8208;aromatic amino acids co&#8208;assemble with tetrafluorophthalic acid to form fluorescent bulk glasses. Amino acid glasses display high fluorescence quantum yields and large Stokes shifts. Their fluorescence performance is maintained even under various harsh conditions, including low temperatures, exposure to organic solvents, and coating with porous materials.








ABSTRACT
Realizing fluorescence emission from non&#8208;aromatic amino acids is a difficult challenge in the development of optical materials in the absence of polymeric backbones and covalent cross&#8208;linkers. Herein, a non&#8208;covalent approach is used to fabricate a series of bulk glasses exhibiting strong fluorescence from non&#8208;aromatic amino acids (&#671;&#8208;arginine, &#671;&#8208;lysine, &#671;&#8208;proline, and &#671;&#8208;histidine) by co&#8208;assembling them with tetrafluorophthalic acid (FA). FA, amino acids, and non&#8208;covalent bonding between them play essential roles in both glass formation and fluorescent properties. The high viscosity and rapid annealing process of the glass formation process effectively prevent the crystallization and packing of FA and amino acids, slow the free internal rotations of the amino acids, and reduce the intermolecular collisions, thus increasing the fluorescence emissions of glasses. FA&#8208;amino acids glasses display high fluorescence quantum yields (&gt; 44%) and large Stokes shifts. Their fluorescence performance is maintained even under various harsh conditions, including low temperatures, exposure to organic solvents, and coating with porous materials. Based on their robust anti&#8208;freezing adhesion capacity (4.77 MPa at &#8722;40&#176;C, 3.30 MPa at &#8722;196&#176;C) and long&#8208;term stable solid&#8208;state luminescence characteristics, these materials show great potential as fluorescent coatings and labeling agents suitable for use at low temperatures.

         <dc:description>
A bias&#8208;driven multi&#8208;peak modulation strategy is introduced to fundamentally improve single&#8208;point spectrometers by mitigating the ill&#8208;posed inverse problem through low&#8208;correlation response functions. Leveraging an asymmetric back&#8208;to&#8208;back organic architecture, the device yields stable and tunable spectral signatures within a structurally simple two&#8208;terminal platform, enabling compact and energy&#8208;efficient spectral sensing and imaging.








ABSTRACT
Balancing resolution, complexity, bandwidth, power, and scalability is essential for advancing single&#8208;point miniaturized spectrometers from lab prototypes to practical portable and integrated photonic systems. In this paper, we present a high&#8208;performance two&#8208;terminal asymmetric back&#8208;to&#8208;back organic spectrometer (BTBOS) that utilizes a bias&#8208;controlled multi&#8208;peak modulation strategy to mitigate the ill&#8208;posed inverse problem common in single&#8208;point architectures. The device achieves a 1&#160;nm spectral resolution across the broad 300&#8211;1000&#160;nm range, with a &#8764;0.25&#160;nm peak error and &lt;2% spectral crosstalk, using only a low driving voltage of 0.6&#160;V. The device further features a structurally simple design along with remarkable stability and reproducibility. In addition, we demonstrate its practical applicability in spectral imaging. This scalable and energy&#8208;efficient approach paves the way for practical and commercial use of miniaturized spectrometers in wearable and on&#8208;chip optical systems.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Split Edge States in Metal&#8208;Supported Graphene Nanoislands Obtained by CVD</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining STM measurements and ab&#8208;initio calculations, we show that zig&#8208;zag edges in graphene nanoislands grown on Ni(111) by CVD retrieve their spin&#8208;polarized edge states after intercalation of a few monolayers of Au.








ABSTRACT
Spin&#8208;split states localized on zigzag edges have been predicted for different free&#8208;standing graphene nanostructures. However, the stability of the edge magnetism can be severely compromised by interfacial interactions when supported on metallic substrates. This imposes a serious challenge for the surface&#8208;assisted synthesis and characterization of magnetic graphene nanostructures, and their application in metal supports. In this work we demonstrate that graphene nanoislands with well&#8208;defined zigzag edges, synthesized by ultra&#8208;high vacuum chemical vapour deposition, can retrieve their spin&#8208;split edge states by minimizing interfacial interactions through metal intercalation. Using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy we detect edge states with subnanometer spatial localization and 1.2 eV energy splitting, comparable to the spin&#8208;polarized states predicted by ab&#8208;initio calculations. The fabrication of magnetic nanographenes by CVD opens a new avenue for the fabrication of 2D nanostructures that cannot be achieved by on&#8208;surface synthesis, and enables the implementation of demonstrated processes for scaling up&#160;synthesis.

         <title>Redirecting Tryptophan Metabolism Through Host&#8208;Microbial Crosstalk to Enhance Precise Bioorthogonal Chemoimmunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work provides a synergistic strategy for enhancing bioorthogonal chemoimmunotherapy through precise prodrug activation and probiotic&#8208;mediated metabolic reprogramming by host&#8208;microbial crosstalk. The nanosystem utilizes the IDO inhibitor NLG919 and Lactobacillus reuteri to reverse tryptophan metabolism from the immunosuppressive pathway to the immunostimulatory pathway, thereby restoring the function of CD8+ T cells and maximizing the efficiency of immunotherapy.








ABSTRACT
Bioorthogonal chemistry offers a promising approach for advancing chemoimmunotherapy, yet two critical challenges remain: (1) achieving deep tumor penetration of catalysts while ensuring precise tumor&#8208;confined prodrug activation, and (2) reversing metabolic immunosuppression to potentiate immunotherapy efficacy. To tackle these issues, here we fabricate a bioorthogonal probiotic nanosystem (NP@ZIF&#8208;8@Apt&#8208;Lr) by engineering prodrug catalysts and an indoleamine 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase (IDO) inhibitor onto AS1411 aptamer&#8208;modified Lactobacillus reuteri (Lr). AS1411&#8208;guided recognition and GSH&#8208;responsive prodrug decaging provide a double guarantee for tumor&#8208;selective drug activation, enabling localized tumor killing and further immunogenic cell death (ICD). Also, the inherent tumor&#8208;homing properties of Lr endow the nanosystem with the ability of penetrating deep tissue. More crucially, the released IDO inhibitor blocks the immunosuppressive kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism, while Lr redirects tryptophan metabolism toward the immunostimulatory indole&#8208;3&#8208;aldehyde pathway through host&#8208;microbial crosstalk. Upon treatment, NP@ZIF&#8208;8@Apt&#8208;Lr overcomes immune tolerance and stimulates T lymphocyte infiltration into tumors. Furthermore, it significantly enhances the efficacy of chemoimmunotherapy by suppressing bilateral tumor development and inducing an immune memory response. This work presents a new strategy for enhancing bioorthogonal chemoimmunotherapy through precise prodrug activation and probiotic&#8208;mediated metabolic reprogramming by host&#8208;microbial crosstalk.

High&#8208;entropy alloy&#8208;based artificial enzymes with pH&#8208;controllable reactive oxygen species (ROS) biocatalysis function as dual&#8208;effect artificial enzymes, offering a stage&#8208;specific and bioadaptive therapeutic strategy for the complex microenvironment of periodontal disease. Extensive assessments confirmed the capacity of these HEA nanoparticles to disrupt pathogenic biofilms, attenuate ROS&#8208;mediated damage, redirect macrophage polarization toward the pro&#8208;regenerative M2 phenotype, and significantly enhance alveolar bone regeneration.








ABSTRACT
Periodontitis, characterized by tenacious polymicrobial biofilms and persistent oxidative stress, presents a formidable therapeutic challenge in clinical practice. Current treatment modalities often fall short in achieving simultaneous biofilm eradication and inflammatory resolution. Here, we present the de novo design of high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA, PtPdRuRhIr)&#8208;based artificial enzymes with modulated d&#8208;band center and pH&#8208;controllable biocatalysis of reactive oxygen species (ROS) for stage&#8208;specific treatment of inflammatory and infectious periodontitis. Our studies demonstrate that the unique structure of PtPdRuRhIr&#8208;based HEA stabilizes the d&#8208;band center, enhances the electron density of Ru atoms, and optimizes the binding strength of oxygen species, thus enabling exceptional ROS biocatalysis and pH&#8208;controllable switching between antioxidase&#8208;like functions at physiological pH conditions and peroxidase&#8208;like activity under acidic infectious environments. Therefore, the PtPdRuRhIr&#8208;based HEA simultaneously exhibits superior regenerative functions by mitigating oxidative damage and bioadaptive antibacterial properties by generating bactericidal ROS. Comprehensive in vitro and in vivo evaluations demonstrate suppression of inflammatory cytokines, functional regeneration of alveolar bone, and also microenvironment&#8208;adaptive disruption of biofilm. By integrating pH&#8208;dependent anti&#8208;inflammatory and antimicrobial activities with immunomodulatory capacity in a single nanoplatform, this smart biocatalyst represents a promising therapeutic strategy for periodontitis and other biofilm&#8208;associated inflammatory disorders, effectively bridging the gap between microbial clearance and tissue restoration.

         <title>Geometry&#8208;Engineered Bipolar Photodetectors for Multivalued Logic&#8208;Gate Encrypted Optical Communication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A geometry&#8208;engineered strategy enables precise balancing of positive and negative photocurrents in fully amorphous, parallel&#8208;structured, self&#8208;powered p&#8208;NiOX&#8211;n&#8208;GaOX photoelectrochemical photodetectors. This design supports robust dual&#8208;band bipolar photoresponse and reconfigurable binary and ternary logic gates, which are successfully applied as encryption architectures in underwater optical communication systems with significantly enhanced information throughput, signal fidelity, and encryption security.








ABSTRACT
Bipolar photodetectors, with positive&#8208;negative photocurrent responses and coupling&#8208;enabled multifunctionality, show great promise for logic&#8208;gate&#8208;encrypted optical communication, where precise photocurrent balancing is essential to minimize polarity&#8208;induced logic errors and ensure transmission accuracy. Here, a parallel&#8208;structured, self&#8208;powered photoelectrochemical photodetector (PEC&#8208;PD) based on fully amorphous p&#8208;NiOX and n&#8208;GaOX thin films is developed, exhibiting dual&#8208;band (254 nm/365 nm) bipolar photoresponses. To address the intrinsic photocurrent asymmetry, we first employ thermal annealing to mitigate the imbalance. More significantly, leveraging the unique parallel architecture, we propose a universal geometry&#8208;engineered strategy to accurately balance positive and negative photocurrents by simply adjusting the area ratio of the two photoactive materials. This approach enables robust photocurrent symmetry across diverse wavelength combinations, ensuring broad adaptability to complex optical environments. Based on this tunability, reconfigurable binary and ternary exclusive OR (XOR and TXOR) logic gates are demonstrated as encryption frameworks in optical communication systems. The ternary encryption scheme enhances information throughput by &#8764;1.585 &#215; and expands the key space by 89% compared to binary systems. This work presents a universal strategy for implementing balanced bipolar photodetectors, facilitating their application in secure, high&#8208;throughput underwater optical communication.

         <title>Visibly Transparent Monolithic Perovskite/Organic Tandem Solar Cells Achieving Over 6% Light&#8208;Utilization Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a design strategy for perovskite/organic tandem solar cells with high visible transparency. An ultra&#8208;wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite top cell absorbs mainly below 530&#160;nm. A ternary organic bottom cell harvests near&#8208;infrared light with minimization of visible absorption. The monolithic tandem device delivers LUE 6.04%, which is the world&#8208;record performance for transparent solar cells.








ABSTRACT
Transparent photovoltaics for solar&#8208;window applications must balance human&#8208;visible clarity with meaningful power output. Here, we report a selectively absorbing, monolithic perovskite/organic tandem that decouples visible transmittance from photocurrent generation and minimizes voltage loss delivering record light&#8208;utilization efficiency (LUE) for visibly transparent (VT) tandem devices. An ultra&#8208;wide&#8208;bandgap, DMA&#8208;alloyed perovskite top sub&#8208;cell harvests primarily &lt;&#8764;530&#160;nm, achieving, as a single junction, AVT 65.68% and power conversion efficiency (PCE) 8.23% (LUE 5.46%). Complemented by a ternary PCE10&#8208;2Cl:Y6:Y12 bottom stack that minimizes visible absorption while harvesting in the NIR, the tandem reaches PCE 10.91% at AVT 55.39%, yielding LUE 6.04%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first VT monolithic perovskite/organic tandem to surpass 6% LUE at AVT &#8805; 50%, while delivering a record&#8208;high open circuit voltage (VOC) of 2.38&#160;V. These results establish optical&#8211;electrical co&#8208;design guidelines for high&#8208;clarity, power&#8208;generating glazing, which explicitly connect materials and interface choices in both sub&#8208;cells to energetic disorder, built&#8208;in potential, and recombination.

         <title>3D Printing&#8208;Assisted Interpenetrating&#8208;Phase Composite Implant Materials Integrating Structural&#8208;Functional Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interpenetrating&#8208;phase composite implant materials are fabricated by infiltrating one constituent into 3D&#8208;printed porous scaffolds of another. After implantation, they demonstrate two potential degradation pathways: selectively partial and sequentially complete degradation. Their mechanical/functional properties can be modulated by combining appropriate constituents and regulating their interpenetrating&#8208;phase structures. These materials hold significant promise for achieving structural&#8208;functional integration, offering new opportunities to enhance bone repair efficacy.








Abstract
Implant materials play a pivotal role in bone repair; however, existing materials face considerable challenges in simultaneously achieving adequate mechanical properties and biological functions. In this perspective, drawing inspiration from nature and leveraging 3D printing technologies, we propose a new strategy to achieve structural&#8208;functional integration through the development of bicontinuous interpenetrating&#8208;phase composite implant materials. These materials are fabricated by infiltrating one constituent into 3D&#8208;printed porous scaffolds of another, and demonstrate two potential degradation pathways after implantation &#8211; selectively partial degradation and sequentially complete degradation &#8211; depending on the types of constituents and their combinations. We elucidate the associated degradation behaviors, regulatory strategies, and the resulting biological functions, and analyze their underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms. Moreover, targeted functional integration and delivery can be realized by infiltrating hydrogels loaded with functional agents into 3D&#8208;printed scaffolds. The mechanical and functional properties of these materials can be deliberately modulated by selecting appropriate constituents and by designing and regulating the interpenetrating&#8208;phase structures. We further examine the challenges faced by these materials and outline prospective directions for future research. Distinct from conventional single&#8208;component materials, 3D printing&#8208;assisted composite implant materials hold significant promise for achieving structural&#8208;functional integration, thereby offering new opportunities to enhance bone repair efficacy.

         <title>Reconfigurable Hydroxyl Dissociation for Spectrally Decoupled Weight Programming and Photocurrent Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To tackle the fundamental challenge in optical programmed processing&#8208;in&#8208;sensor (PIS) paradigm, this work presents a spectral&#8208;decoupling strategy. The reversible surface hydroxyl dissociation in bismuth oxyselenide reconfigures oxygen vacancy dynamics upon ultraviolet (UV) light, directly modulating photoresponsivities in the visible range. This enables a valid PIS paradigm that programs weights and computes photocurrents in different spectral bands.








ABSTRACT
The rise of the Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) demands sensory systems with reduced size, weight, and power (SWaP). The processing&#8208;in&#8208;sensor (PIS) paradigm offers a solution, providing superior compactness and power&#8208;efficiency, critical for edge vision applications. Among emerging optoelectronic neuromorphic devices, the direct photocurrent computing (DPC) route is uniquely attractive, using photoresponsivity to encode weights for in&#8208;sensor multiply&#8211;accumulate (MAC) operations. However, current DPC devices rely on electrical signals for weight programming, which complicates circuitry and limits bandwidth compared to all&#8208;optical approaches. To address this, we present an optically programmable DPC device based on a vacancy&#8208;modulated bismuth oxyselenide (BOS) material platform. Critically, the reversible surface hydroxyl dissociation is found to reconfigure oxygen vacancy dynamics upon ultraviolet light, enabling the spectrally decoupled weight programming and photocurrent computing. Based on this, we demonstrate a BOS array implemented PIS hardware for low&#8208;power, coarse classification and as a pre&#8208;processing unit for more complex vision tasks in a processing&#8208;near&#8208;sensor (PNS) paradigm. Finally, a hybrid architecture is proposed to intelligently allocate computational resources between PIS and PNS, promising for an optimal balance of power and performance for next&#8208;generation edge AIoT applications.

         <title>Tunable Stability and Performance of Fused Thienothiophene Based Polymers for Organic Electrochemical Transistors and Artificial Synapse Based on A Side Chain Reorganization Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By extending the conjugated backbone and reorganizing side chains, we developed 4gTT&#8208;2gT, a polythiophene&#8208;based mixed conductor with high &#181;C* (729 F&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1), low threshold voltage, and excellent operational stability. The material functions reliably in OECT&#8208;based artificial synapses across 233&#8211;373&#160;K, showing great promise for smart wearable electronics.








ABSTRACT
We report a series of novel polymeric mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors based upon the incorporation of fused thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene and bithiophene with isomeric sidechains. The enhanced rigidity in the polymer backbone facilitated the formation of stabilized bipolarons, while the reorganized ethylene glycol side chains not only maintained the polymer's hydrophilicity but also unexpectedly enhanced the crystallinity of the polymer film. This design strategy led to the development of 4gTT&#8208;2gT, a high&#8208;performance and stable organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductor. The polymer exhibited a maximum &#181;C* of 729 F V&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, one of the highest values among low&#8208;threshold voltage polythiophene derivatives, while demonstrating excellent operational stability, retaining 99% of its maximum current after 1&#8208;h device switching cycles and 94% after 9&#8208;h at lower bias. We implemented the material in OECT&#8208;based artificial synapses, which maintained functionality under a large temperature range (23&#8211;373 K). These combined properties establish 4gTT&#8208;2gT as a prime candidate for next&#8208;generation mixed conductor devices.

         <title>Suppressing Thermal Aggregation of Fullerene Enables ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;3 Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unsatisfactory thermal aggregation of fullerene derivatives has long hindered the realization of thermally durable inverted perovskite solar cells. Inspired by the robust architecture of spider webs, a &#8220;fullerene&#8208;fixed web&#8221; strategy is presented to immobilize fullerene molecules effectively. The resulting devices deliver a champion efficiency of 26.39% and retain &gt;90% of their initial performance after 800 h operation under ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;3 condition.








ABSTRACT
Inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs), as the promising candidates for practical photovoltaics, always undergo severe degradation under standard commercial testing conditions (ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;3, 1 sun + RH&#8805;50% + 85&#176;C), posing a major obstacle to their commercialization. One of the inherent bottlenecks lies on that the fullerenes would spontaneously aggregate into crystalline clusters at high temperature, causing the irreversible interface destruction. Herein, drawing inspiration from the bionic spider web, &#8220;fullerene&#8208;fixed web&#8221; is constructed to firmly immobilize [6,6]&#8208;phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) molecules via in situ polymerized 3&#8208;aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APTMS)&#8208;derived siloxane network. The hydrolyzed and polymerized APTMS forms a robust 3D framework that confines PCBM through strong hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions, thereby suppressing its thermal aggregation. Simultaneously, the exposed amino groups of the network passivate the perovskite surface defects and strengthen the perovskite/ETL interfacial coupling. As a result, the target inverted PSCs achieve a champion efficiency of 26.39% (certified 26.27%) and retain over 90% of initial performance after 800 h age under ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;3 condition&#8212;significantly outperforming the control (24.98%, T90 &lt; 250 h). This work provides a feasible and effective pathway toward achieving highly efficient and photothermally durable perovskite photovoltaics.

     alt="Suppressing Thermal Aggregation of Fullerene Enables ISOS-L-3 Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unsatisfactory thermal aggregation of fullerene derivatives has long hindered the realization of thermally durable inverted perovskite solar cells. Inspired by the robust architecture of spider webs, a &#8220;fullerene-fixed web&#8221; strategy is presented to immobilize fullerene molecules effectively. The resulting devices deliver a champion efficiency of 26.39% and retain &amp;gt;90% of their initial performance after 800 h operation under ISOS-L-3 condition.

         <title>Coordinatively Unsaturated IrC3 Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Efficient Methanol Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops a single Ir atom catalyst with unsaturated IrC3 sites for methanol oxidation. It breaks the scaling relationship for balanced *CH3OH/*CO adsorption and promotes *OH generation via water dissociation. This overcomes sluggish kinetics, achieving a low potential of 0.05&#160;V and a high H2 production rate of 8694&#160;mol&#160;H2&#160;mol&#160;Ir&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 at 180&#176;C in an HT&#8208;PEME. 








ABSTRACT
Methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) plays a crucial role in renewable energy conversion and storage, where the key steps involve dehydrogenation and subsequent *CO electrooxidation. However, *CO oxidation remains challenging due to its strong adsorption and insufficient *OH species at active sites, severely limiting reaction kinetics. Here, the single Ir atom catalyst with abundant coordinatively unsaturated IrC3 sites is developed to electrocatalysis MOR under elevated temperature, the IrC3 sites with stronger CH3OH adsorption and weaker *CO adsorption, which break the scaling relationship between methanol and *CO adsorption energy. Moreover, the IrC3 could accelerate the electrochemical water dissociation with assistance of protophilic IrC4 to form adsorbed *OH. The balanced adsorption energy and the appearance of ample *OH would efficiently decrease the reaction energy barriers, and further accelerate the methanol dehydrogenation and *CO oxidation. By assemble the high temperature polymer electrolyte membrane electrolyzer (HT&#8208;PEME) with IrC3 sites at 180&#176;C, it shows an excellent MOR efficiency with onset potential about 0.05&#160;V and H2 generation rate with 8694 molH2&#160;molIr&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 at cathode, which is much higher than that of Ir&#8208;C SACs parent catalyst and Pt/C catalysts. This finding provides an avenue to conquer the formidably sluggish kinetics of MOR for hydrogen utilization.

         <title>Electrically Tunable and Linearly Polarized Mid&#8208;Infrared Photoluminescence in 2D Tellurium</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient and electrically tunable mid&#8208;infrared emitter based on 2D tellurium is demonstrated. Notably, under electrical modulation, the emitter preserves two key intrinsic properties: a stable emission wavelength and near&#8208;perfect linear polarization. By leveraging this robust control, we construct high&#8208;speed electro&#8208;optical switches and logic gates, addressing the critical need for integrated mid&#8208;infrared photonic components.








ABSTRACT
The integration of electronic and photonic chips hinges on the availability of efficient light sources and modulators that are compatible with on&#8208;chip interconnects. Among these, mid&#8208;infrared (mid&#8208;IR) emitters are especially critical, as they enable low&#8208;loss transmission through atmospheric windows and unlock powerful capabilities for molecular fingerprinting and chemical sensing. In this study, we demonstrate that 2D tellurium (Te) nanoflakes can serve as highly efficient, electrically tunable, and linearly polarized mid&#8208;IR emitters. Leveraging the narrow direct bandgap (&#8776;0.36&#160;eV) and anisotropic crystal symmetry of Te nanoflakes, we achieve electrically tunable mid&#8208;IR photoluminescence (PL) with near&#8208;complete PL intensity modulation, a stable emission wavelength (&#8776;3.4&#160;&#181;m), and near&#8208;perfect linear polarization. In addition, we demonstrate a dual&#8208;gate device that allows independent control of the electrostatic doping and vertical electric field, and further theoretical analysis reveals that the electrical tunability of the PL intensity originates primarily from the gate&#8208;controlled carrier density. Building on this robust control, we demonstrate high&#8208;speed electro&#8208;optical switches and programmable logic gates for on&#8208;chip encryption, underscoring the excellent compatibility of Te with advanced optoelectronic circuits. Collectively, these advances establish Te as a cornerstone material for hybrid electronic&#8208;photonic systems, directly addressing the urgent demand for mid&#8208;IR components in next&#8208;generation optical interconnects.

         <title>Breaking the &#8220;Seesaw Effect&#8221;: 20.72% Efficiency Organic Solar Cells via Cascade Energy Transfer with a Fluorescent Sensitizer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates that incorporating the fluorescent small molecule SD&#8208;EDOT into the PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 blend mitigates the Voc&#8211;Jsc trade&#8208;off. SD&#8208;EDOT reduces energetic disorder, forms an energy cascade, promotes efficient charge generation, and suppresses non&#8208;radiative recombination. Consequently, ternary organic solar cells achieve simultaneously enhanced Voc and Jsc, boosting the power conversion efficiency from 18.75% to 20.72%.








ABSTRACT
Though organic solar cells (OSCs) have achieved remarkable progress recently, the intrinsic limitation of the &#8220;seesaw effect&#8221; between open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) and short&#8208;circuit current density (Jsc) hinders their further improvements. In this study, a fluorescent small molecule, namely SD&#8208;EDOT, is incorporated into the widely used PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 system to overcome this challenge. The addition of SD&#8208;EDOT lowers the energetic disorder and electron&#8211;phonon coupling within the system. More importantly, it forms an energy cascade between donor and acceptor, enabling a side cascade energy transfer pathway and a more favorable energetic landscape. The high fluorescent property of SD&#8208;EDOT improves the utilization rate of high&#8208;energy excitons. These effects collectively promote faster and more efficient charge generation (improving Jsc), deeper highest occupied molecular orbit of donors, and suppressed non&#8208;radiative energy loss (elevating Voc). Consequently, the ternary devices achieve simultaneously higher Voc and Jsc, significantly boosting the power conversion efficiency from 18.75% to 20.72%. This study provides a rational strategy for mitigating the Voc&#8211;Jsc trade&#8208;off by incorporating a highly fluorescent third component with tailored energy levels, offering a promising pathway toward higher&#8208;performance OSCs.

We pioneer a novel SnCl4/trifluorotoluene hybrid plasma technology to construct a Li&#8208;Sn alloy&#8208;based gradient SEI on lithium metal anodes with a Li&#8208;Sn alloy constituting the bottom layer, LiF occupying the middle layer, and a composite layer of LiCl and organic lithium compounds forming the top layer. The designed G&#8208;SEI can synergistically regulate reaction kinetics, structure, and crystal orientation of lithium deposition, and enhanced performances are verified in the modified Li anodes.








ABSTRACT
Design and optimization of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is extremely important for the construction of advanced lithium metal anodes. Herein, we pioneer a novel SnCl4/trifluorotoluene hybrid plasma technology to construct a Li&#8208;Sn alloy&#8208;based gradient SEI on lithium metal anodes to synergistically regulate reaction kinetics, structure, and crystal orientation of lithium deposition. Notably, the designed SEI displays a gradient layered structure, with a Li&#8208;Sn alloy constituting the bottom layer, LiF occupying the middle layer, and a composite layer of LiCl and organic lithium compounds forming the top layer. The formation mechanism is primarily attributed to the differential acceleration effects exerted by the plasma shell's electric field on different plasma ions. The gradient SEI exhibits multifunctionality, featuring not only high Young's modulus (13.9&#160;GPa) and enhanced interfacial structural stability, but also enabling the Li&#8208;Sn alloy component within the SEI to facilitate the preferential growth of the (110) crystal plane with a low migration barrier, thereby achieving the uniform deposition of Li without dendrite growth. Consequently, the modified Li anode exhibits a low overpotential and high coulombic efficiency, and the corresponding pouch cell shows improved cycling stability. This research provides a pioneering interfacial modification strategy for the fabrication of high&#8208;performance lithium metal anodes.

         <title>Unsaturated Vinyl Branching: A Molecular&#8208;Tailoring Strategy for Synergistic Stacking Regulation and Energy&#8208;Loss Suppression Toward 20%&#8208;Efficiency Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The uncontrolled aggregation of non&#8208;fullerene acceptors critically limits the performance of organic solar cells. We introduce an unsaturated vinyl branching (UVB) strategy that simultaneously minimizes steric hindrance and strengthens non&#8208;covalent interactions to precisely tune molecular stacking and aggregation kinetics. The resulting acceptor, BTP&#8208;vinyl, forms an optimal blend morphology, leading to suppressed energy loss and achieving a champion efficiency of 20.06%.








ABSTRACT
The performance of organic solar cells (OSCs) is critically constrained by energy losses arising from disordered molecular packing and suboptimal blend morphology in non&#8208;fullerene acceptor (NFA) systems. Achieving precise control over NFA aggregation during film formation is thus essential to realize optimal molecular orientation and phase separation. Herein, we propose an unsaturated vinyl branching (UVB) strategy that enables synergistic morphology control through the concurrent minimization of steric hindrance and enhancement of non&#8208;covalent interactions. By incorporating UVB units into the inner side chains of the Y6&#8208;OD backbone, we create a novel acceptor, BTP&#8208;vinyl, which demonstrates optimized aggregation kinetics and facilitates compact 3D molecular packing. When blended with polymer donor D18, the BTP&#8208;vinyl&#8208;based system exhibits retarded crystallization, optimized domain size, and highly ordered face&#8208;on orientation, collectively promoting efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport. Consequently, OSCs based on BTP&#8208;vinyl display significantly reduced energetic disorder and suppressed non&#8208;radiative energy loss compared to Y6&#8208;OD&#8208;based devices. The binary devices achieve a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.6%, substantially outperforming the Y6&#8208;OD&#8208;based devices (18.1%). Furthermore, ternary devices incorporating L8&#8208;BO attain a champion PCE of 20.06%, crossing the significant 20% threshold. This work establishes UVB as an effective molecular&#8208;design paradigm for achieving ideal blend morphology through precise aggregation control in high&#8208;performance OSCs.

Enamel&#8208;Mimetic Composites
An enamel analog is fabricated with a gradient structure similar to inner enamel based on the crisscross assembly of aligned hybrid nanowires through a magnetic&#8208;assisted freeze casting and subsequent mechanical compression strategy. The composites exhibit high mechanical performance surpassing the natural tooth enamel, which is fundamentally accounted for the interface reinforcement of gradient structure, crystal/amorphous and organic/inorganic.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Controllable Liquid Transfer: From Fundamentals in Micro&#8208;Patterning to Applications in Optoelectronics</title>

         <dc:description>
The nature&#8208;inspired fibrous&#8208;guided direct&#8208;writing strategy, which enables controllable liquid transfer, has demonstrated advantages in making various desired micro&#8208;patterns with cm&#8208;scale uniformity, &#181;m&#8208;scale resolution, and molecular&#8208;scale orientation. This review systematically summarizes the research progress in making micro&#8208;patterns using a fibrous&#8208;guided strategy, including both the fundamentals of liquid manipulation and applications in optoelectronics, as well as the remaining challenges.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed micro&#8208;patterning is a crucial process for making high&#8208;performance optoelectronic devices, since the carrier transfer behavior is closely related to the uniformity, orientation, and resolution of micro&#8208;patterns. Developing solution processes with good controllability has thus attracted increasing research interest in the last decade. Inspired by Chinese brushes, a fibrous&#8208;guided direct&#8208;writing strategy is recently developed that enables controllable liquid transfer for making micro&#8208;patterns, which is systematically reviewed from viewpoints of both the fundamentals in liquid manipulation and the applications in optoelectronics. First, a model structure of dual&#8208;conical fibers (CFs) is proposed, whose capacity in liquid transfer is featured as the dynamic liquid balance and the uniform liquid film. On the basis, triple&#8208; and multi&#8208; CFs are developed for transferring liquid onto the target substrate in a controllable manner, where the tri&#8208;phase contact line can be finely tuned. Thereafter, micro&#8208;patterns with &#181;m&#8208;scale resolution, cm&#8208;scale uniformity, and molecular&#8208;scale orientation can be achieved, as is demonstrated by the as&#8208;prepared ultrasmooth quantum dot films, highly aligned silver nanowires films, and wrinkle&#8208;free reduced graphene oxide films, respectively. The high&#8208;performance optoelectronic devices, including quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes, flexible transparent electrodes, and pressure sensors, are demonstrated. Perspectives for solution&#8208;processed micro&#8208;patterning in optoelectronics are also suggested.

         <title>Life Engineering of Materials: Artificial Materials as Plugins for Biological Regulations</title>

Life engineering of materials: Constructing life plugins based on artificial materials, and achieving non&#8208;natural transformation and evolution of biological systems through the mutual integration and interaction between materials and life processes. Transform nonliving materials into components of life, breaking the boundaries between traditional material science and life science.








Abstract
Biomineralization is nature's precision engineering system, creating functional biomaterials with exceptional performance through orchestrated organic&#8211;inorganic synergistic interactions. Beyond fundamental investigations into biomineralization processes and mechanisms, research has evolved from structural biomimetics toward creating interdependent material&#8211;organism hybrids through mineralization&#8208;inspired design. Breakthroughs in technologies such as inorganic ion polymerization have significantly advanced strategies for fusing artificial materials with hard tissue regeneration (teeth/bones). Through material&#8211;biological integration strategies such as extracellular assembly, artificial organelle transplantation, and artificial functional tissue construction, the creation of artificial life plugins with enhanced nongenetic biological functions (not directly encoded by the DNA) has been achieved. A key pathway to achieving mineralization&#8208;inspired design lies in the development of a material&#8208;engineered bio&#8208;plugin, the material unit with interfaces characterized by chemically tailored compatibility and programmable bio&#8208;interactions. Materials that can serve as bio&#8208;plugins confer organisms with emergent functionalities such as cell protection, vaccine enhancement, and disease treatment. This review systematically summarizes recent advancements in artificial material&#8211;biological fusion technologies, highlights their critical role in the life engineering of materials, and envisions their potential to catalyze new paradigms in biomedical applications.

         <title>Elastic Energy Storage in Biological Materials: Internal Stresses and Their Functionality</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 51, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Harnessing and storing internally generated elastic energy is a clever strategy by biological materials to perform functions like shape transformation, movement, and predation. This review explores how biological systems manipulate mechanisms like atomic or protein integration into minerals, protein conformational shifts, phase transitions, and osmotic pressure to store and utilize elastic energy&#8212;functioning as &#8220;elastic energy batteries&#8221; to drive biological processes.








Abstract
In the biological world, materials are often heterogeneous and anisotropic, comprising components with very different elastic properties. The resulting structures are exposed to force generation by chemo&#8208;mechanical energy conversion&#8212;such as water absorption, phase separation, or crystallization. Such phenomena may result in strain misfits that generate internal stresses that store elastic energies, which turn out to be extremely useful for enabling functions such as shape change, locomotion, or predation. However, the significance of elastic energy storage has received little attention. In this review, by considering examples of a broad spectrum of biological materials spanning shape&#8208;morphing plant seed pods, smart appendages of crustaceans, ballistic tongues, and damage&#8208;tolerant mineralized tissues, the fundamental aspects involved in the generation, storage, and release of internally generated elastic energies are surveyed. These have major implications for functions such as strengthening and toughening, shape morphing and actuation, ballistic movements, tensegrity, and bending stabilization. How Phenomena such as atomic or protein incorporation into minerals, conformational changes of proteins, phase transformation, and osmotic pressure are manipulated in the biological world to generate function by storing elastic energy are described. Such &#8220;elastic energy batteries&#8221; provide efficient performance and evolutionarily adapted functionality through a smart, structure&#8208;based energy management.

         <title>Nature&#8208;Inspired Liquid Crystal Polymer Actuators: From Alignment Regulation to Nano&#8208;composition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 51, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of nature&#8208;inspired LCP actuators appears as a bridge between artificial systems and the natural biological intelligence. Here, an overview of the development and cutting&#8208;edge advancements is provided in nature&#8208;inspired LCP actuators, focusing on how alignment regulation and nano&#8208;composition influence their actuation modes and performance. Furthermore, an outlook is proposed for the LCP actuators closer to actual biological muscles and their potential in soft robotics.








Abstract
Liquid crystal polymers (LCPs) that possess crosslinked networks and ordered alignment of mesogens are renowned for their large and reversible anisotropic deformation in response to external stimuli, which holds great potential in the burgeoning field of nature&#8208;inspired actuators and robots. Continuous efforts have been made in revealing the interplay between materials chemistry, processing, and alignment of LCPs, to broaden the actuation modes and enhance the actuation performance toward practical utilization. In this review, the advances in nature&#8208;inspired LCP actuators is focused with special attentions devoted in their mesogen alignment and the macroscopic geometry. Since the mesogen alignment is vital for the attainable actuation modes, the methods for alignment regulating are detailly combed, including surface&#8208;enforced alignment, field&#8208;assisted alignment, mechanical alignment, rheological alignment, and self&#8208;assembly. Subsequently, the composition of nanomaterials is futher surveyed in LCP actuators with a focus on enhancing the actuation performance.

     alt="Nature-Inspired Liquid Crystal Polymer Actuators: From Alignment Regulation to Nano-composition"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of nature-inspired LCP actuators appears as a bridge between artificial systems and the natural biological intelligence. Here, an overview of the development and cutting-edge advancements is provided in nature-inspired LCP actuators, focusing on how alignment regulation and nano-composition influence their actuation modes and performance. Furthermore, an outlook is proposed for the LCP actuators closer to actual biological muscles and their potential in soft robotics.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liquid crystal polymers (LCPs) that possess crosslinked networks and ordered alignment of mesogens are renowned for their large and reversible anisotropic deformation in response to external stimuli, which holds great potential in the burgeoning field of nature-inspired actuators and robots. Continuous efforts have been made in revealing the interplay between materials chemistry, processing, and alignment of LCPs, to broaden the actuation modes and enhance the actuation performance toward practical utilization. In this review, the advances in nature-inspired LCP actuators is focused with special attentions devoted in their mesogen alignment and the macroscopic geometry. Since the mesogen alignment is vital for the attainable actuation modes, the methods for alignment regulating are detailly combed, including surface-enforced alignment, field-assisted alignment, mechanical alignment, rheological alignment, and self-assembly. Subsequently, the composition of nanomaterials is futher surveyed in LCP actuators with a focus on enhancing the actuation performance. Finally, perspectives on the current challenges and potential development trends are discussed, which may shed light on future investigations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 51, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Learning from unique chemical and topological characteristics of natural prototypes, researchers have developed plentiful particle materials for diverse bioanalytical applications. In this review, a comprehensive summary of the advances in nature&#8208;inspired particles, encompassing design principles, preparation methods, and bioanalytical applications is presented. It also critically evaluates the unresolved challenges hindering practical implementations in bioanalysis and proposes some promising research directions.








Abstract
Nature has evolved sophisticated prototypes to achieve functions from efficient separation to selective capture, targeted interaction, and interactive communication. These biological blueprints provide transformative inspiration for engineering advanced particle materials tailored for bioanalytical challenges. This review comprehensively examines recent advances in nature&#8208;inspired particles from natural prototypes to preparation methods and various bioanalytical applications. The design principle of nature&#8208;inspired particles originates from the unique chemical and topological characteristics of natural prototypes including biomolecules (proteins and nucleic acids), subcellular particles (virus, extracellular vesicles (EVs), bacteria, and platelet), cells (erythrocyte, sperm cell, immune cell, and pollen), creatures (urchin and hedgehog), and minerals (zeolites). Various preparation methods have been developed to replicate the intricate features of these prototypes. These nature&#8208;inspired particles have demonstrated effectiveness in bioanalytical applications, such as i) adsorption, separation, and removal of biological molecules, ii) interaction, recognition, and capture of biological particles, iii) biological sensing, and iv) biological imaging. Some existing challenges and potential research opportunities have also been indicated in bioanalytical practice. It is anticipated that more nature&#8208;inspired particles would be created with programmable chemistry and topology, exhibiting integrated functions, and benefiting various practical bioanalytical applications with the assistance of artificial intelligence (AI) and big data processing.

         <title>Nature&#8208;Inspired Multidisciplinary Strategies for Tissue and Organ Cryopreservation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 51, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rooted in evolutionary adaptations observed in freeze&#8208;resistant organisms, these bioinspired strategies converge to form a cross&#8208;disciplinary synergy&#8212;harnessing principles from physics, molecular biophysics, supramolecular chemistry, and biomimetic materials science&#8212;to engineer tailored cryopreservation protocols for architecturally diverse biosystems such as tissues and organs. By emulating nature's antifreeze mechanisms, desiccation tolerance, and cold&#8208;adaptive cellular signaling, this paradigm shift addresses the unique thermodynamic and structural challenges of complex biological specimens.








Abstract
Cryopreservation of organs and tissues represents a significant advancement in biomedicine, integrating fields such as cell biology, tissue engineering, and organ transplantation. However, this technique faces substantial challenges, primarily due to ice&#8208;related damage and biological stress responses. This review first highlights these critical obstacles and then examines the sophisticated strategies that various organisms have evolved to survive extreme cold. Key mechanisms include complex biological stress responses (involving cold signal perception, metabolic reconfiguration) and physical ice&#8208;control strategies, such as deep eutectic solvents (DESs), adsorption&#8208;inhibition by ice&#8208;binding proteins (IBPs), and the crowding assemblies such as coacervates and hydrogels. Inspired by these biological principles, the review discusses significant advances in cryoprotection technology: 1) Innovative cold&#8208;adaptation biology applied to organ preservation; 2) Advanced techniques to develop artificial ice&#8208;controlling molecules and materials; 3) Advanced rewarming strategies utilizing nanoparticles. Despite this promising progress, key challenges in translating these laboratory innovations into clinical practice are discussed. Finally, we propose an ideal &#8220;cocktail&#8208;style&#8221; cryoprotectant combining vascular&#8208;targeted nanoparticles for ice control, extracellular matrix&#8208;stabilizing polymers, cell&#8208;specific ice regulators, and metabolic modulators, potentially transforming transplant medicine through global organ banking and advancing regenerative therapies.

         <title>Nature&#8208;Inspired Design Strategies for Efficient Atmospheric Water Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 51, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents advances in bioinspired atmospheric water harvesting systems, emphasizing how structural motifs such as wettability gradients, directional transport, and hierarchical porosity have been translated into engineered fog&#8208;collection and vapor&#8208;sorption strategies for enhanced water uptake, accelerated transport, and energy&#8208;efficient release. It outlines the design principles that bridge biological inspiration with practical, scalable solutions to address the global water challenges.








Abstract
The accelerating global scarcity of freshwater, driven by rapid economic growth, environmental degradation, and climate change, has heightened the urgency for the development of advanced atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) strategies. Earth's atmosphere contains an enormous reservoir of &#8776;13 trillion tons of water, exceeding the volume of all accessible surface freshwater, yet it remains vastly underutilized. Effectively utilizing the atmospheric water requires efficient capture and release strategies that can function under diverse climatic conditions. Through millions of years, organisms in both arid and humid environments have evolved specialized structures or surfaces to capture water directly from the atmosphere. This review highlights recent advances in bioinspired AWH systems, emphasizing how structural motifs such as wettability gradients, directional transport, and hierarchical porosity are translated into engineered fog&#8208;collection and vapor&#8208;sorption systems, leading to enhanced water uptake, accelerated transport, and energy&#8208;efficient release. By integrating insights from various complementary approaches, the design principles and fabrication strategies that bridge biological inspiration with practical, high&#8208;efficiency AWH for scalable solutions to address the global water challenges are outlined.

Mechanical information recognition technology, which integrates information acquisition, pre&#8208;processing&#160;and processing, promises to enable applications in intelligent robotics, healthcare, and virtual reality. The mechanosensory systems of organisms in nature have inspired to develop mechanical information bionic recognition technology to address the challenges of information acquisition performance and information processing efficiency. In this work, bionic strategies for information pre&#8208;processing, acquisition, and processing are summarized systematically. The potential applications, future challenges, and opportunities of MIBRT are also presented.








Abstract
Mechanical information is a medium for perceptual interaction and health monitoring of organisms or intelligent mechanical equipment, including force, vibration, sound, and flow. Researchers are increasingly deploying mechanical information recognition technologies (MIRT) that integrate information acquisition, pre&#8208;processing, and processing functions and are expected to enable advanced applications. However, this also poses significant challenges to information acquisition performance and information processing efficiency. The novel and exciting mechanosensory systems of organisms in nature have inspired us to develop superior mechanical information bionic recognition technologies (MIBRT) based on novel bionic materials, structures, and devices to address these challenges. Herein, first bionic strategies for information pre&#8208;processing are presented and their importance for high&#8208;performance information acquisition is highlighted. Subsequently, design strategies and considerations for high&#8208;performance sensors inspired by mechanoreceptors of organisms are described. Then, the design concepts of the neuromorphic devices are summarized in order to replicate the information processing functions of a biological nervous system. Additionally, the ability of MIBRT is investigated to recognize basic mechanical information. Furthermore, further potential applications of MIBRT in intelligent robots, healthcare, and virtual reality are explored with a view to solve a range of complex tasks. Finally, potential future challenges and opportunities for MIBRT are identified from multiple perspectives.

         <title>Mussel&#8208;Inspired Molecular Strategies for Fabricating Functional Materials With Underwater Adhesion and Self&#8208;Healing Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 51, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review systematically examines the nanomechanical mechanisms of mussel&#8208;inspired molecular interactions, primarily investigated by direct force measurement techniques such as surface forces apparatus and atomic force microscopy. The macroscopic adhesive and self&#8208;healing performances of mussel&#8208;inspired functional materials, including coacervates, coatings, and hydrogels, are correlated with the underlying reversible and dynamic molecular interactions.








Abstract
The exceptional underwater adhesion and self&#8208;healing capabilities of mussels have fascinated researchers for over two decades. Extensive studies have shown that these remarkable properties arise from a series of reversible and dynamic molecular interactions involving mussel foot proteins. Inspired by these molecular interaction strategies, numerous functional materials exhibiting strong underwater adhesion and self&#8208;healing performance have been successfully developed. This review systematically explores the nanomechanical mechanisms of mussel&#8208;inspired molecular interactions, mainly revealed&#160;by direct force measurement techniques such as surface forces apparatus and atomic force microscopy. The development of functional materials, including coacervates, coatings, and hydrogels, with underwater adhesion and self&#8208;healing properties, is then summarized. Furthermore, the macroscopic material&#160;performances are correlated with the underlying molecular mechanisms, providing valuable insights for the rational design of next&#8208;generation mussel&#8208;inspired functional materials with enhanced underwater adhesion and self&#8208;healing properties.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Nacre&#8208;Inspired 2D Carbon&#8208;Based Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 51, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes recent advancements in nacre&#8208;inspired 2D carbon&#8208;based nanocomposites (TDCNs) based&#8208;graphene and MXene. Innovative fabrication strategies have been developed to align nanosheets while effectively eliminating voids through interfacial bridging, synergistic toughening, and confined assembly. The resulting densified TDCNs demonstrate exceptional fatigue resistance, electrical conductivity, and durability, making them suitable for applications in flexible electronics, bone tissue regeneration, and thermal insulation.








Abstract
Nacre has become the golden standard for the structural design of high&#8208;performance composites due to extraordinary fracture toughness, which exceeds the mixing principle of traditional composites by two orders of magnitude. Surprisingly, the unique biomaterials are formed under ambient temperature and pressure conditions, resulting in low energy consumption and no pollution. It is an effective approach to obtain inspiration from structure&#8208;activity relationships of biomaterials for developing the next&#8208;generation of high&#8208;performance composites. Furthermore, 2D carbon nanomaterials, such as graphene and MXene, having exceptional mechanical and electrical properties, are ideal candidates for fabricating new generation high&#8208;performance composites that would replace carbon fiber (CF) composites. This review systematically summarizes relevant works for high&#8208;performance 2D carbon nanocomposites (TDCNs) inspired by nacre. The review first explores structural insights from the nacre. Next, the fabrication strategies of TDCNs are systematically summarized, with an emphasis on achieving highly aligned 2D carbon nanosheets through advanced assembly techniques. Subsequently, the critical role of void defects, which is a key factor governing the mechanical properties of TDCNs, is addressed by analyzing their formation mechanisms, characterization methodologies, and elimination strategies. Finally, the applications and challenges of high&#8208;performance TDCNs obtained through highly aligned assembly and densification processes are discussed.

         <title>Hofmeister Effect in Flexible Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 51, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Harnessing the Hofmeister effect for smart elasticity control in flexible devices, this review reveals how ion&#8208;material interactions enable simplified and adaptive mechanical regulation. It highlights applications in flexible electronics, optics, and biomedicine, and outlines a forward&#8208;looking roadmap for developing next&#8208;generation intelligent and responsive materials.








Abstract
The Hofmeister effect has attracted considerable attention for its unique ability to modulate elasticity in flexible devices. Unlike traditional approaches that often involve complex procedures and yield unstable outcomes, the Hofmeister effect enables efficient and controllable elasticity tuning through specific ion&#8208;material surface interactions. This mechanism allows precise regulation of surface wettability, thereby facilitating dynamic adjustment of elastic properties. The review systematically summarizes the research progress on the Hofmeister effect, including its concept, underlying mechanisms, and influencing factors, with a particular focus on its applications in flexible electronics, optics, and biomedical devices. By elucidating the underlying mechanisms of ion&#8208;induced material modulation, the review highlights the potential of the Hofmeister effect to advance the design of next&#8208;generation smart materials. It aims to provide both a theoretical foundation and practical guidance for developing high&#8208;performance flexible systems.

         <title>Natural Cell&#8208;Inspired Nanoparticles: Preparation, Mechanisms, Applications, and Prospects for Clinical Translation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 51, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review comprehensively examines nature cell&#8208;inspired nanoparticles (NCINPs), which achieve molecular&#8208;level emulation of natural cells through precise reconstruction of membrane interfaces. It systematically catalogs diverse natural cell membrane sources, details advanced biofabrication strategies, and elucidates functional mechanisms and therapeutic potential across diverse biomedical applications. The review critically analyzes barriers to clinical translation and discusses potential regulatory solutions for NCINP technologies.








Abstract
Natural cell&#8208;inspired nanoparticles (NCINPs) represent a transformative innovation in nanomedicine, featuring a core&#8211;shell structure coated with isolated natural cell membranes (NCMs) that effectively mimic the functions of native cells. The development of NCINPs achieves molecular&#8208;level emulation of native cells by precisely reconstructing the hierarchical architecture of the bio&#8208;interface, including the structure of the phospholipid bilayer, lipid rafts, protein matrix, and polysaccharide interactions. This advanced biomimetic strategy not only retains the inherent biocompatibility and targeting precision of natural cells but also enables programmable functionalities that surpass those of natural systems, offering enhanced therapeutic potential. In this review, an in&#8208;depth introduction to the background of natural cell&#8208;inspired research is provided, the current prevalent synthesis methods of NCINPs is delineated, and the application mechanisms based on various types of NCMs, as well as their applications in both benign and malignant diseases are elucidated. However, clinical translation faces significant challenges: complex synthesis, compromised membrane functionality, and unpredictable in vivo behavior. The work comprehensively synthesizes the progress, limitations, and challenges encountered throughout the development of NCINPs, while delineating future prospects. Bridging the translational gap from bench to bedside accelerates the clinical translation of NCINPs and fully realizes their therapeutic potential across diverse medical applications.

This review systematically summarizes bioinspired solar&#8208;driven interfacial evaporation (SDIE) architectures that synergistically integrate membrane separation, adsorption, and photocatalytic processes.

Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven interfacial evaporation (SDIE) has emerged as a transformative technology for clean water generation by localizing solar&#8208;thermal energy conversion at the air&#8208;liquid interface. Beyond water production, recent advancements reveal its potential as a pivotal platform for addressing the challenges in resource reclamation and environmental sustainability. Drawing inspiration from plant transpiration mechanisms, particularly ion&#8208;selective absorption, long&#8208;distance transport, and bioactive enrichment, this review systematically examines bioinspired SDIE architectures that synergistically integrate membrane separation, adsorption, and photocatalytic processes. The recent progress is summarized across three tiers: 1) structural biomimetics replicating natural plants, 2) functional hybridization coupling complementary purification mechanisms, and 3) hierarchical integration of multi&#8208;process cascades. The review highlights the recent progress in material innovation and structure design to expand its function. Furthermore, implementation frameworks addressing interfacial engineering, process optimization, and system durability are proposed to bridge lab&#8208;scale prototypes with practical applications. The future prospects are also outlined for multifunctional SDIE technologies to address water&#8208;energy&#8208;resource interdependency, advancing their role in sustainable environmental management.

         <title>Engineering Biomimetic Nanofluidics Toward High&#8208;Performance Osmotic Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 51, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review comprehensively overviews the latest progress in advanced nanofluidic channels, focusing on optimizing permselectivity to boost ion transport efficiency. It emphasizes the systematic manipulation of nanochannel architectures to balance permeability and selectivity. Finally, it provides forward&#8208;looking insights into the future of osmotic energy conversion, including AI integration in nanofluidic design, expanded applications, and technology integration.








Abstract
As industrialization deepens and population surges, the demand for sustainable energy has emerged as a globally critical challenge. Osmotic energy&#8212;generated from Gibbs free energy between different solutions&#8212;stands out as a viable solution to the energy crisis. The key to efficient osmotic energy conversion is the development of nanofluidic materials with high&#8208;selectivity and high&#8208;flux transmembrane ion transport behaviors. This Review provides a comprehensive overview of the latest progress in advanced nanofluidic channels, focusing on optimizing permselectivity to enhance ion transport efficiency. The systematic manipulation of nanochannel architectures is underscored to navigate the inherent balance between permeability and selectivity. Furthermore, the impact of external field regulation on the controlled ion transport within nanofluidic channels, aiming to boost osmotic energy conversion, is explored. At last, visionary insights into the future of osmotic energy conversion are offered, encompassing the combination with artificial intelligence (AI) in nanofluidic design, the expansion of application landscapes, and the integration with other complementary technologies.

         <title>Superwetting Catalysts: Principle, Design, and Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 51, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here strategies for constructing superwetting catalyst systems via physical mixing and chemical modification are highlighted. The physical mixing strategy emphasizes the selection and classification of diverse superwetting inorganic materials and polymers, while the chemical modification approach focuses on the design of molecular sieves, metal&#8211;organic frameworks, and single&#8208;atom catalysts with tailored surface wettability.








Abstract
Superwettability has revolutionized catalyst design for multiphase reactions by significantly enhancing interfacial interactions and mass transport. Here the design principles and synthesis strategies of superwetting catalysts are primarily introduced, with a particular focus on their confinement effects and mass transport mechanisms. First, the critical roles of superwettability is highlighted in facilitating efficient reactant mass transport, product desorption, and intermediate confinement within catalysts, which are pivotal for optimizing multiphase reaction systems. Besides, the key strategies, including physical mixing and chemical modification, are summarized to engineer superwettability interfaces in catalysts. Particular attention is given to wettability regulation in porous materials such as molecular sieves, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), and single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), emphasizing its effect on improving mass transport and confinement effects. The materials used for superwetting catalysts design are summarized. Finally, future directions, including large&#8208;scale fabrication of superwetting membrane reactors, dynamic wettability tuning under operational conditions, and advanced in situ characterization techniques to capture real&#8208;time triple&#8208;phase interfacial phenomena, are outlined. These advancements are poised to expand the application of superwetting catalysts in sustainable energy, environmental remediation, and industrial catalysis, addressing key challenges in multiphase reaction systems.

         <title>Nanostructured Protein Surfaces Inspired by Spider Silk</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 51, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Harnessing recombinant spider silk technology, bioengineered spidroin variants enable the creation of functionalized nanostructured coatings with tunable affinity for specific targets, supporting a broad range of applications &#8208; from antifouling surfaces and targeted drug delivery to advanced cell therapies and precision bio&#8208;patterning via lithography.








Abstract
Spider silk is renowned for its exceptional mechanical properties, surpassing those of many natural and synthetic materials. This review focuses on biotechnologically produced recombinant spidroin variants inspired by well&#8208;understood major ampullate spider silk proteins (=spidroins), which are role models for understanding molecular composition, architecture, and the nanoscopic and mesoscopic structures formed through self&#8208;assembly and phase separation of spider silk fibers. The use of recombinant spidroins is explored to fabricate functionalized nanostructured surfaces, and molecular engineering is highlighted to tailor the interfacial properties of various morphologies, including particles, capsules, electrospun nanofibers, films/coatings, macroscopic nanofibril&#8208;based hydrogels, and nanohydrogel coatings. One focus is on functionalization of spidroins with peptide tags enabling a variety of affinity&#8208;based targets from cellular markers to inorganic nanoparticles, and allowing for instance specific drug delivery, cell accommodation in hydrogels, or bioselective immobilization of cells on surfaces. Furthermore, applying nanostructured spidroin coatings in combination with photo&#8208; and soft&#8208;lithography techniques is demonstrated, which can be used to produce micro&#8208; and nanostructured patterns exhibiting confined, spidroin&#8208;defined targeting, affinity, or repulsion properties.

         <title>Biological and Biologically Inspired Functional Nanostructures: Insights into Structural, Optical, Thermal, and Sensing Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 51, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biological and biologically&#8208;inspired functional nanostructures with structural, thermal, optical, and sensing applications are reviewed. The role of nanoscale features in biological materials on performance is described, and their blueprints are used for bio&#8208;inspired nanomaterials, synthesized using advanced techniques (i.e., photolithography, bio&#8208;templating, additive manufacturing), demonstrating analogous functional mechanisms and superior performance relative to conventional materials.








Abstract
Biological materials developed over millennia consist of simple biogenic materials, yet exhibit exceptional functional properties. Leveraging design features from these structures with engineered nanomaterial components can lead to bio&#8208;inspired structures that demonstrate superior performance over traditional engineering materials. We describe nanoscale based architectures in biological systems, their role in enhancement of structural, optical, thermal and sensing properties, and their subsequent translation to bio&#8208;inspired structures. In structurally robust biological materials, we highlight nanoscale design features that enhance strength and stiffness, while retaining toughness. In optically active biological materials, we show how periodic nanostructures manipulate electromagnetic waves resulting in structural coloration as well as antireflective and camouflaging properties. Thermally regulating biological materials utilize nanopores and other nanostructural features to statically or dynamically control temperature. In addition, biological materials that are used in sensing utilize various nanostructures that enhance sensitivity by decreasing activation thresholds for signal transduction. We discuss challenges and opportunities including understanding control mechanisms in the formation of biological materials and leveraging advancements in self&#8208;assembly with new additive manufacturing techniques. The continued evaluation of organisms, including those that exhibit multifunctionality, provides not only new design features and pathways, but significant prospects for innovation in this ever&#8208;emerging field.

         <title>Recent Advances in Reactive Microdroplets for Clean Water and Energy</title>

Reactive microdroplets enable precise and sustainable chemistry at small scales. This review explores their role as confined reactors and dynamic interfaces for synthesizing functional materials, fuels, and microdevices. It offers a critical perspective on how droplet&#8208;based platforms can drive next&#8208;generation technologies in clean energy, environmental remediation, and smart sensing.









Abstract
Microdroplets have emerged as powerful and sustainable platforms for the design and synthesis of functional materials under mild and environmentally friendly conditions. Their unique physicochemical environments &#8208; characterized by high surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratios and confined internal space &#8208; enable precise control over mass and heat transfer, interfacial energy conversion, and chemical reactions. These features have been harnessed in two main ways: first, by employing microdroplets as microreactors for the fabrication of advanced materials such as polymeric microlenses, artificial compound eyes, metal oxide nanoparticles, and metal&#8208;organic framework microstructures; and second, by using microdroplets as reactive entities to accelerate interfacial reactions relevant to hydrogen and biodiesel production, as well as nitrogen and carbon dioxide fixation. Together, these strategies have driven significant advances in clean energy generation, environmental monitoring, and water treatment. This review provides a critical overview of recent progress in microdroplet&#8208;assisted synthesis of functional materials and their integration in energy and environmental technologies. An emerging direction in the integration of microdroplet&#8208;based systems into adaptive sensing and human&#8208;machine interfaces driven by artificial intelligence is also&#160;highlighted.

         <title>Automated Label&#8208;Free Assay for Viral Detection and Inhibitor Screening via Biomembrane&#8208;Functionalized Microelectrode Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 51, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioelectronic sensor integrating 2D cell membranes with organic microelectrode arrays enables detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 fusion pathways. Natively&#8208;expressed viral receptors promote monitoring of viral entry and screening of antibody&#8208;based inhibitors. Integration with microfluidics further enhances throughput and usability, establishing a powerful platform for investigating viral fusogenicity and accelerating antiviral drug development.








Abstract
Most virus infection assays have indirect readout such as virus number following entry (e.g., PCR, cell lysis). While effective, these technologies are labor&#8208;intensive, require specialized environments (e.g., sterile or RNA&#8208;free), and detect later&#8208;stage viral events like lysis or cell death, lacking sensitivity to early fusion events. To address these limitations, we present biologically relevant 2D membrane materials, host&#8208;cell&#8208;derived supported lipid bilayers (hcd&#8208;SLBs), integrated with organic microelectrode arrays (OMEAs) for detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2)&#160;fusion. By overexpressing angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors on the native membranes, the platform functions as a viral sensor capable of detecting virus pseudo particles (VPPs) through the late pathway. Additionally, hcd&#8208;SLBs extracted from human lung epithelium expressing native ACE2 detect fusion events through the early pathway. The platform's utility as a drug&#8208;screening tool is demonstrated by testing antibodies targeting either the ACE2 on the host membrane or the viral spike (S) proteins. To enhance the throughput, microfluidics are integrated for automation and OMEAs are incorporated within each channel, miniaturizing the testing units. This system supports high&#8208;throughput data generation, automation, and scalability, providing an efficient platform for viral fusion detection that advances the study of pathogen&#8208;host interactions and accelerates antiviral drug discovery.

         <title>A Gradient Enamel&#8208;Mimetic Composite via Crisscross Assembly of Aligned Hybrid Nanowires for Excellent Mechanical Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 51, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gradient enamel&#8208;mimetic composites (GEMC) are fabricated by the magnetic&#8208;assisted dual&#8208;directional freezing assembly of amorphous ZrO2 layer&#8208;coated hydroxyapatite nanowires and subsequently, scalable layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly with nanowires&#8217; direction crossed stacking. The enamel analog exhibits high strength and toughness surpassing the natural tooth enamel, and simultaneously high stiffness and damping comparable to those of enamel, as well as high fatigue resistance. Such an enamel biomimetic strategy offers guidelines for the engineering of gradient structure materials with excellent mechanical properties.








Abstract
Materials with excellent comprehensive mechanical properties (e.g., strength and toughness, stiffness and damping, fatigue et&#160;al.) are highly desirable for engineering applications, while it is still challenged for design. Tooth enamel is a typical biomaterial with outstanding mechanical properties that originate from its multiscale and gradient structure. Some composites with enamel&#8208;like multiscale structures are successfully synthesized, but mimicking the gradient structure of tooth enamel is still difficult to realize. Here, an enamel analog is fabricated with a gradient structure similar to inner enamel based on the crisscross assembly of aligned hybrid nanowires through a magnetic&#8208;assisted freeze casting and subsequent mechanical compression strategy. The gradient enamel&#8208;mimetic composites exhibited high strength and toughness surpassing the natural tooth enamel, and simultaneously high stiffness and damping comparable to those of enamel, as well as high fatigue resistance. The interface reinforcement of gradient structure, crystal/amorphous and organic/inorganic, fundamentally accounted for high mechanical performance. The gradient design strategy provides an avenue for the engineering of structural materials with excellent mechanical properties.

         <title>How Does a Delicate Insect Wing Resist Damage? Chitin Orientation Is Adapted to the Mechanical Demands at the Nanoscale</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 51, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoscale chitin fiber orientations in the insect wing play a critical role in adapting to complex mechanical demands. These findings reveal two distinct and functionally adaptive chitin orientation patterns in the membranes that vary regionally, optimizing mechanical resilience and deformation control. These insights provide a foundation for bioinspired designs in micro air vehicles and advanced fiber&#8208;reinforced materials.








Abstract
Insect wings achieve an extraordinary balance between structural robustness and lightweight flexibility, enabling efficient and durable flight. This performance arises from their hierarchical composite architecture, where nanoscale chitin fiber orientations play a critical role in adapting to complex mechanical demands. Using scanning X&#8208;ray micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;diffraction, the spatial distribution and orientation of chitin fibers in the hindwing of the desert locust Schistocerca gregaria are systematically mapped. These findings reveal two distinct and functionally adaptive chitin orientation patterns in the membranes that vary regionally, optimizing mechanical resilience and deformation control. Finite element simulations further demonstrate how these nanoscale structural adaptations enhance crack resistance, structural integrity, and elastic strain energy distribution, reinforcing vein&#8208;membrane connections for sustained functionality under various loadings. By integrating high&#8208;resolution structural analysis with computational modeling, this study uncovers the sophisticated biomechanical strategies that enable insect wings to endure extreme flight conditions. These insights provide a foundation for bioinspired designs in micro air vehicles and advanced fiber&#8208;reinforced materials.

         <title>Achieving Ultra&#8208;High&#8208;Power Output in Triboelectric Energy Harvesters by Torrent&#8208;Like Charge Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 51, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes a torrent&#8208;like charge regulation (TCR) strategy that simultaneously enhances charge transport rate and the total amount of charges by combining transistor&#8208;inspired switching architecture and bio&#8208;inspired vascular system. Compared to traditional energy harvesters, the TCR&#8208;based energy harvester increases the energy density by 100 times, achieving a volumetric peak power density over 10 MW&#160;m&#8722;3.








Abstract
The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art energy harvesters that harness environmental kinetic energy toward realizing battery&#8208;free Internet of Things (IoT) applications are susceptible to low power density owing to low charge density and high output impedance. Here, a new charge regulation strategy is introduced that simultaneously enhances charge transport rate and the total amount of charges, allowing for achieving a volumetric peak power density exceeding 10 MW&#160;m&#8722;3. It is demonstrated that such an enhanced performance results from the synergistic cooperation between a transistor&#8208;inspired switching architecture that accelerates charge transfer rate whereas minimizing internal impedance and a bio&#8208;inspired charge vascular system that enhances the amount of generated charge, together contributing to a torrent&#8208;like charge regulation (TCR). The unique TCR strategy as well as the induced high power output endows a fully battery&#8208;free wireless sensing and communication platform, highlighting its potential to enable sustainable, distributed battery&#8208;free IoT networks in real&#8208;world applications.

         <title>Anisotropically Thermal&#8208;Protective Porous Ceramics Enabled by Nacre&#8208;Like Framework</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 51, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Relying on the porous nacre&#8208;like framework, large&#8208;scale thermal&#8208;protective ceramic is produced via a simple bottom&#8208;up film&#8208;to&#8208;bulk assembly strategy. This porous ceramic achieves the combination of mechanical and anisotropic thermal properties, making it good candidate for complex thermal protection applications.








Abstract
Ever more severe energy dilemma and unfulfilled demands for thermal protection applications have drawn a great interest in developing thermal protective materials. Though great progress is achieved by implementing several advanced micro&#8208;architectures, the conflict between thermal insulation and mechanical properties, along with the complex manufacturing process, remains the main obstacles for fabricating ideal integrated thermal insulation materials. Here, a scalable nacre&#8208;like porous ceramic is reported with a good combination of thermal insulation and mechanical strength (&#8776;0.058&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1, 22&#160;MPa) via a bottom&#8208;up film&#8208;to&#8208;bulk assembly. The well&#8208;aligned microplatelets constructed the nacre&#8208;like framework and produced porosity in between for thermal insulation while the mineral bridges between microplatelets connected and strengthened the whole framework. Besides, the structure&#8208;induced anisotropy of thermal conductivity on out&#8208;plane and in&#8208;plane directions provides the possibilities for heat management. Moreover, this material shows an excellent fire&#8208;resistance and maintained performance after fire. These structure&#8208;induced integrated superiorities made this material good candidate for complex thermal protection applications.

         <title>Towards Differentiation in Untethered Microactuators: A Soft Fabrication Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 51, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article introduces a fabrication strategy for developing soft microactuators with orthogonally programmed shape, texture, and molecular anisotropy. Using microfluidics to generate liquid crystal droplets encased in hydrogel fibers enables the shaping of droplets into various geometries, which are then magnetically aligned and polymerized to give rise to a diverse library of soft microactuators.








Abstract
This work describes a microfluidic high&#8208;throughput fabrication method for untethered soft microactuators which, while initially unspecific, develop distinct shapes, surface textures, and actuation modes based on various environmental cues. Analogous to the core concept of cell differentiation, the central idea of this technique is to apply controlled mechanical and chemical stimuli to a deformable hydrogel fiber and transmit the induced geometrical and textural changes to embedded droplets. Using liquid crystal (LC) monomer droplets as a core allows&#160;us to orthogonally program the geometric, textural, and molecular architecture of the resulting microactuators upon droplet polymerization. Fine&#8208;tuning of the microfluidic parameters yields microdroplets that dry and transform into microparticles with a variety of shapes, including spindle, rod, pancake, dumbbell, pyramid, and worm&#8208;like assemblies with a range of aspect ratios. Leveraging mechanical instability via rapid dehydration of hydrogel fibers allows us to generate and impart stable 3D patterns to the core, resulting in microparticles that vary both in global shape and surface texture. After polymerizing these precursor droplets in a magnetic field to encode the mesogenic orientation, LCE microactuators are realized with a rich library of shapes, surface patterns, and molecular structures, each displaying distinct deformations upon heating, validated via finite element analysis.

         <title>Self&#8208;Sustained, Continuous Jumping of a Light&#8208;Driven Electronics&#8208;Free Insect&#8208;Scale Soft Robot</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 51, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a 301 mg soft robot capable of continuous, autonomous jumping with energy harvesting, actuation, and control embedded in their physical structure without electronics. Coupling snap&#8208;through instability with self&#8208;shadowing of photoresponsive LCEs yields over 188 nonstop and 800 lifetime jumps, with self&#8208;righting, directional locomotion, sensing, and heavy load&#8208;bearing, advancing long&#8208;lived insect&#8208;scale autonomy.








Abstract
Insects scavenge energy from the environment for self&#8208;sustained operation, and some species use repeated jumping to traverse varied terrain. Such capabilities are desirable for surveillance, disaster recovery, environmental monitoring, and hazardous environment exploration. However, insect&#8208;scale (sub&#8208;gram) robots are typically limited to few jumps due to inefficient integration of energy, actuators, and control. Here, insect&#8208;scale (301&#160;mg) soft robots capable of continuous, autonomous jumping with energy harvesting, actuation, and control embedded in their physical structure without electronics are introduced. Powered by constant light, a single robot achieves 188 nonstop jumps and accumulates over 800 jumps in a year without diminished performance. This behavior is enabled by self&#8208;sustained, repeated snapping (SSRS), a light&#8208;driven mechanism from a self&#8208;shadowing&#8208;induced feedback loop based on dynamic light&#8211;material interplay. The SSRS exploits snap&#8208;through instability and self&#8208;shadowing of photoresponsive liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs), enabling untethered, perpetual actuation, and the snapping dynamics are investigated through simulations and experiments. Beyond sustained motion, the robot demonstrates self&#8208;righting, directional jumping, obstacle negotiation, hazardous gas sensing, and extreme load&#8208;bearing (&#8776;1700 times its weight), highlighting potential for disaster recovery, confined&#8208;space exploration, and environmental monitoring. This work advances insect&#8208;scale robotics toward fully autonomous, long&#8208;lived micro&#8208;robots.

         <title>Heterogeneous Nanopore Arrays &#8211; Selective Modification of Nanopores Embedded in a Membrane</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 51, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biological processes rely on the concerted action of channels with different functionalities embedded in the same membrane. Inspired by nature, heterogeneous nanopore arrays are prepared where two nanopores are connected in parallel and function as two different elements of an ionic circuit: a diode and a resistor. The results provide the basis to design ionic circuits that mimic physiological processes and communication.








Abstract
Much effort in the field of nanopore research has been directed toward reproducing the efficient transport phenomena of biological ion channels. For synthetic nanopores to replicate channel function on the scale of a cellular membrane, it is necessary to consider the modes of crosstalk between channels as well as to develop approaches to prepare nanopore arrays consisting of pores with different transport properties, akin to a membrane in an axon. In this manuscript, first ion concentration polarization (ICP) is identified as the primary means of the crosstalk, and subsequently, the extent and degree of ICP is tuned via targeted chemical modification of the pore walls&#8217; functional groups. Next, two fabrication methods of a model two&#8208;nanopore array are presented in a silicon nitride membrane in which one nanopore contains a bipolar ionic junction and functions as an ionic diode, while the other one is a homogeneously charged ionic resistor. The targeted chemical modification of a thin gold layer at the opening of one pore in an array that leaves the other pore located a few tens of nm away, unmodified, is utilized. These results provide an important framework for designing abiotic ionic circuits that can mimic physiological multichannel ion transport and communication.

         <title>Bioinspired Superwetting Nanomaterials and Beyond: Ultralow Energy Consumption in High&#8208;Efficiency Bio&#8208;Synthesis, Energy Conversion, and Information Transmission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 51, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective summarizes the progress of superwettability research in the group. Beyond superwettability, A crucial question is raised: how can life systems achieve ultralow energy consumption (UEC) in high&#8208;efficiency bio&#8208;synthesis/energy conversion/information transmission? The physicochemical essence to achieve these UEC processes is revealed, and a summary and perspective on high&#8208;efficiency bio&#8208;synthesis/energy conversion/information transmission in artificial systems are provided.








Abstract
This Perspective first briefly summarizes the progress of superwettability research in the group over the past 25 years, starting by studying the effect of nanostructure and micro/nanostructure on surface wettability. The intrinsic wetting thresholds for different liquids according to the transition point of superlyophilicty and superlyophobicity on nanostructured surface are experimentally determined, and over 10 superwetting interfacial materials are invented. Recently, the study of dynamic superwettability is focused, which refers to the property of liquids superspreading on 1D or 2D surfaces with micro/nano structures, or partial ordered flow in micro/nano channels, and even the ordered flow of ions and molecules in biological ion channels/water channels/enzyme channels. Furthermore, a crucial question in life science is raised: how can life systems achieve ultralow energy consumption (UEC) in high&#8208;efficiency bio&#8208;synthesis, energy conversion, and information transmission? It is revealed that the ordered directional collective motion of ions/molecules in biological nanochannels is the physicochemical essence to achieve these UEC processes, and provides a summary and perspective on high&#8208;efficiency bio&#8208;synthesis, energy conversion, and information transmission in artificial systems.

&lt;p&gt;This perspective summarizes the progress of superwettability research in the group. Beyond superwettability, A crucial question is raised: how can life systems achieve ultralow energy consumption (UEC) in high-efficiency bio-synthesis/energy conversion/information transmission? The physicochemical essence to achieve these UEC processes is revealed, and a summary and perspective on high-efficiency bio-synthesis/energy conversion/information transmission in artificial systems are provided.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Perspective first briefly summarizes the progress of superwettability research in the group over the past 25 years, starting by studying the effect of nanostructure and micro/nanostructure on surface wettability. The intrinsic wetting thresholds for different liquids according to the transition point of superlyophilicty and superlyophobicity on nanostructured surface are experimentally determined, and over 10 superwetting interfacial materials are invented. Recently, the study of dynamic superwettability is focused, which refers to the property of liquids superspreading on 1D or 2D surfaces with micro/nano structures, or partial ordered flow in micro/nano channels, and even the ordered flow of ions and molecules in biological ion channels/water channels/enzyme channels. Furthermore, a crucial question in life science is raised: how can life systems achieve ultralow energy consumption (UEC) in high-efficiency bio-synthesis, energy conversion, and information transmission? It is revealed that the ordered directional collective motion of ions/molecules in biological nanochannels is the physicochemical essence to achieve these UEC processes, and provides a summary and perspective on high-efficiency bio-synthesis, energy conversion, and information transmission in artificial systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

De&#8208;Saturation of Single&#8208;Atom Copper Catalysts
In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202509221), Jiong Lu, Yafei Zhao, Shibo Xi, and co&#8208;workers introduce a de&#8208;saturation strategy that efficiently converts the CuN4 into CuN3 under a KOH&#8208;mediated Joule thermal shock. The resulting de&#8208;saturated CuN3 catalysts promote copper&#8211;alkyny formation and significantly enhance catalytic performance. Symbolically, the CuN4&#8212;with a molecular weight of exactly 120&#8212;celebrates the 120th anniversary of NUS.

Accurate in vitro recreation of the tumor microenvironment, particularly the complex cancer&#8211;stromal interactions, is essential for deciphering cancer biology and advancing therapies. This review summarizes fundamental design principles for developing physiologically faithful tumor models, surveys recent technological and translational developments, and provides guidance for selecting modeling approaches based on specific&#160;research questions. Outstanding&#160;challenges and future directions are also discussed.








Abstract
Accurate in vitro modeling of the tumor microenvironment (TME) is essential for advancing our understanding of cancer biology and for developing effective anti&#8208;cancer therapeutics. Context&#8208;dependent and patient&#8208;specific, the dynamic interactions between cancer cells and stromal elements significantly affect tumor progression and treatment response. Recent advances in biomaterials, microdevices, and molecular analysis techniques have facilitated the development of in vitro tumor models that better replicate these cancer&#8208;stromal interactions. In turn, these models have deepened the understanding of cancer biology, leading to the discovery of new prognostic markers and establishing preclinical platforms that more reliably predict clinical outcomes. However, challenges persist in fully capturing the immense complexity of the TME and translating these models for real clinical impact. In this review, key design principles for creating physiologically relevant tumor models are first described, then the latest advances in tumor modeling that have contributed to new biological insights and progress in drug development are discussed.

         <title>From Pollution to Value: Electrochemical Systems for Transforming Flue Gas into Chemicals and Fuels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents a comprehensive overview of the strategies whereby low&#8208;concentration CO2 in flue gas can be directly valorized to value&#8208;added chemicals and fuels. It covers recent progress in integrated CO2 capture and conversion, including amine and bi(carbonate) reduction&#8208;based systems. This study also focuses on how the presence of impurities such as oxygen, sulfur oxides, and nitrogen oxides can be overcome.








Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) can enable the production of fuels and chemicals from CO2 emissions. Direct flue gas conversion can address the emissions from hard&#8208;to&#8208;abate sectors, including cement, steel, and power generation industries. Such integration with SCO2RR can also decarbonize the petrochemical industry and eliminate separation and purification steps. Here, recent progress and emerging opportunities for transformative flue&#8208;gas&#8208;tolerant systems for producing fuels and chemicals are reviewed. The review begins by analyzing recent progress in direct flue gas conversion and highlighting emerging micro&#8208;reaction environment features. Next, performance degradation mechanisms associated with flue gas conversion in CO2RR systems are discussed. Following this, the bicarbonate reduction reaction (BRR) and CO2RR from amine&#8208;based capture as emerging strategies for high&#8208;rate, selective, and stable electrosynthesis of chemicals from feeds containing low CO2 concentrations are highlighted. Finally, the mitigation of flue gas impurities such as oxygen, sulfur oxides, and nitrogen oxides, is discussed,&#160;and perspectives for emerging opportunities are shared.

This review highlights recent advances in 2D open framework materials (2D OFMs), including metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs), with a focus on programmable pore architectures and functional skeletons. It underscores the critical roles of porosity and framework design in facilitating adsorption and membrane&#8208;based separations, as well as in developing semiconductors with electronic properties vital for energy storage and conversion applications.








Abstract
2D open framework materials (2D OFMs), including metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs), have emerged as a versatile class of materials that combine atomic precision, intrinsic porosity, and tunable chemical functionality. By bridging the structural features of inorganic layered materials with the chemical diversity of organic polymers, 2D OFMs provide unique opportunities in molecular separations, semiconductors, and related technologies. Their in&#8208;plane periodicity and layered architectures enable precise control over pore environment, stacking mode, and electronic coupling, thereby unlocking structure&#8211;property relationships not accessible in conventional porous materials. This review highlights recent advances in the topological design of 2D OFMs, incorporating functional skeletons and programmable pore architectures, as well as emerging characterization techniques capable of resolving structural details or providing high&#8208;resolution imaging at the atomic scale. Particular attention is given to the roles of porosity and the framework skeleton in enabling adsorptive and membrane&#8208;based separations, as well as to semiconductors with electronic properties that underpin energy storage and conversion applications. By providing a comprehensive overview of current progress and future directions, this review underscores the technological promise of 2D OFMs. The advances summarized here establish a foundation for further innovation and practical deployment across diverse scientific and engineering domains.

         <title>Design Strategies and Roles of Hydrogels for Sustainable Energy Conversion and Harvesting from Natural and Biological Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review examines hydrogel&#8208;based technologies driven by environmental stimuli and emphasizes their unique contributions to energy conversion. It provides insights into design strategies and recent advancements in functional hydrogels, highlighting opportunities and challenges in this field. As hydrogel&#8208;based energy harvesting evolves, innovative design, deeper mechanistic understanding, and interdisciplinary integration are needed to unlock its potential.








Abstract
The growing demand for sustainable energy has spurred interest in harvesting ambient sources, such as solar radiation, mechanical vibrations, water flow, and temperature gradients, and biological activities, such as motion and respiration. In this context, hydrogels have emerged as promising materials bridging natural and physiological energy environments. Known for their polymer networks and biocompatibility, hydrogels are widely used across bioengineering, biomedicine, and agriculture. Beyond these applications, hydrogels are also gaining attention in environmental and energy&#8208;related technologies, including solar&#8208;driven desalination, catalysis, and energy generation and storage. Their appeal lies in unique physicochemical properties, stimuli&#8208;responsiveness, tunable interfacial chemistry, environmental benignity, and efficient mass and heat transfer while maintaining mechanical compatibility with hybrid or soft&#8211;hard systems. Despite these promising attributes, few reviews focus on the role of hydrogels in energy harvesting. This review addresses that gap by examining hydrogel&#8208;based technologies driven by environmental stimuli and emphasizing their unique contributions to energy conversion. It offers insights into design strategies and recent advancements in functional hydrogels, highlighting opportunities and challenges in this field. As hydrogel&#8208;based energy harvesting evolves, innovative design, deeper mechanistic understanding, and interdisciplinary integration are needed to unlock its potential.

         <title>Advances in Intelligent Nano&#8208;Micro&#8208;Scale Sensors and Actuators: Moving toward Self&#8208;Sustained Edge AI Microsystems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents a system&#8208;level synthesis of advances enabling next&#8208;generation Edge&#8208;AI microsystems: transduction materials and mechanisms, hybrid photonic&#8211;MEMS platforms, rigid and stretchable devices, in/near&#8208;sensor computing, and tribo/piezo energy harvesting. Integrating photonics&#8208;enabled sensing and AI across edge and cloud will yield autonomous, human&#8208;centric systems and energy&#8208;aware AIoT, including digital&#8208;human twins and city sensing commons across healthcare, industry, and smart cities.








Abstract
Over recent decades, nano&#8208;micro&#8208;scale sensors and actuators have evolved from discrete microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) components. As demand for maintenance&#8208;free systems grew, developments emphasized integrating energy harvesting into sensing platforms and deploying self&#8208;powered sensors that utilize piezoelectric and triboelectric transducers. Such co&#8208;localization enabled self&#8208;sustained Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things (IoT) deployments, supporting continuous operation without external power and improving network autonomy and scalability. Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) at the sensor edge has further transformed these platforms into intelligent AI&#8208;of&#8208;Things (AIoT) systems, enabling multimodal analytics, adaptive decision&#8208;making, and immersive human&#8211;machine interaction. Concurrently, advances in photonics&#8212;including mid&#8208;infrared, terahertz, and near&#8208;infrared technologies&#8212;have produced sensitive molecular and chemical sensors with improved selectivity and spectral resolution. These advances have also yielded photonic integrated circuits capable of ultrafast in&#8208;sensor computation and real&#8208;time Bayesian photonic neural inference, delivering sophisticated edge&#8208;AI processing with low latency and power consumption. Hybrid systems that combine flexible wearable electronics with integrated photonic platforms have emerged, allowing direct transduction and interpretation of mechanical and physiological signals from flexible sensors via photonic chips. Progress in materials, packaging, and system co&#8208;design underpins reliability and operation in harsh environments. Together, these advances foreshadow highly integrated, self&#8208;sustained edge&#8208;AI microsystems that embody perpetual, real&#8208;time intelligence and seamless user&#8211;environment interaction.

         <title>Targeted ROS Scavenging for Disease Therapies Using Nanomaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;scavenging nanomaterials, their mechanisms, classifications, and targeting strategies for disease treatment. It discusses progress, challenges, and perspectives for future clinical applications of ROS&#8208;related nanomedicines.








Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are essential by&#8208;products of cellular metabolism and serve as key mediators in cell signaling and homeostasis. Excessive ROS production is associated with cellular damage and various diseases. Therefore, targeted ROS scavenging may enhance therapeutic efficacy and minimize side effects. With significant progress in nanotechnology, various nanomaterials with targeted ROS&#8208;scavenging properties have been developed to modulate ROS levels in biological microenvironments. In this review, the mechanisms underlying ROS generation and elimination in humans and in ROS&#8208;related diseases are first outlined. The latest advancements in ROS&#8208;scavenging nanomaterials, particularly their mechanisms and composition&#8208;based classifications, are then focused on. Strategies for improving the targeting ability of ROS&#8208;scavenging nanomaterials and their application in the therapeutics of ROS&#8208;induced diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, acute kidney injury, diabetic wounds, and cancer are highlighted. Finally, the challenges faced by ROS&#8208;targeted nanotherapeutics are discussed, and possible alternatives to accelerate their clinical translation are proposed.

         <title>Recent Advances in Impurity&#8208;Induced Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent advances in organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP), emphasizing the critical role of trace impurities. Their origins, mechanisms, and potential applications are discussed for RTP systems while underscoring the importance of purity analysis to avoid misinterpretations and ensure an accurate understanding of RTP mechanisms.








Abstract
Organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials with large Stokes shifts and prolonged afterglows are gaining increasing attention in a variety of applications, including displays, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, sensing, and bioimaging. However, achieving high&#8208;performance organic RTP remains challenging due to weak spin&#8208;orbit coupling, rapid non&#8208;radiative decay, and unstable triplet excitons. Early studies focused on crystal engineering, as ordered lattices restrict molecular motion and stabilize triplet excitons. Analyzing crystal structures and packing provides valuable insights into intermolecular interactions, while theoretical calculations have clarified electronic structures, laying the foundation for rational RTP material design. However, recent findings suggest RTP in many single&#8208;component systems may arise from trace impurities, significantly influencing RTP properties. This discovery has greatly advanced the understanding of impurity&#8208;induced phosphorescence. This review systematically examines the role of impurities in RTP, detailing their origins from starting materials, solvents, and side reactions. It also explores how these identified impurities can serve as essential building blocks for designing new RTP materials. Finally, essential methods for evaluating compound purity, emphasizing the critical importance of rigorous analysis and validation are presented. Material purity plays a pivotal role in RTP research, as impurities can distort experimental data, potentially leading to misinterpretations that can impede advancements in understanding the underlying mechanisms.

The tunability of band gap enables wide bandgap perovskites to serve as top subcells shared by various emerging tandem technologies. Based on the application of wide bandgap perovskites in perovskite/silicon, perovskite/perovskite, perovskite/organic, and perovskite/CIGS tandem solar cells, this review outlines the theory, progress, challenges, and future path of wide bandgap perovskites.








Abstract
The global demand for clean energy is driving the need for next&#8208;generation solar technologies with higher power conversion efficiencies. Multijunction solar cells, which stack absorbers with cascaded bandgaps, offer a compelling path forward by more efficiently utilizing the solar spectrum. Among these, metal halide perovskites stand out for their bandgap tunability, enabling efficient tandem solar cells (TSCs) when paired with a range of semiconductors&#8212;including perovskite/perovskite, perovskite/silicon, perovskite/organic, and perovskite/CIGS. Central to these architectures are wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites, which harvest high&#8208;energy, short&#8208;wavelength photons. This review highlights recent advances and challenges in perovskite&#8208;based TSCs, focusing on the photophysical properties and application of wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites across different tandem configurations. Future research directions are outlined aimed at enhancing performance and long&#8208;term stability to accelerate industrial deployment.

         <title>Utilize Natural Forces in Water Treatment Through 3D&#8208;Printed Structures: From Purification to Clean Energy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review investigates recent advances in 3D&#8208;printed functional materials and devices that utilize natural forces for water treatment, including oil/water separation, photodegradation, desalination, and photovoltaic water splitting for clean energy, with a particular focus on the unique benefits conferred by structural design. Integrated design and modular manufacturing workflow are proposed, promoting standardized production and collaborative development to accelerate design iteration.








Abstract
The utilization of natural forces for water purification has long been a pursuit of scientific and technological interest, offering the potential to reduce both energy consumption and secondary pollution associated with conventional processes. Structural materials play a pivotal role in water treatment by harnessing natural forces, such as gravity, capillarity, and solar energy, to purify water or even to generate clean energy from water, enabling structure&#8208;determined properties beyond material functionality. With their advantages in design freedom and structural customization, 3D printing techniques offer significant potential for materializing these designs into functional devices. This review investigates recent advances in 3D&#8208;printed materials and devices that utilize natural forces for water purification, including gravity&#8208;driven oil/water separation, solar&#8208;powered photodegradation, solar evaporation desalination, and photovoltaic water splitting for clean energy, with a particular focus on the benefits conferred by structural design. Harnessing the holistic design freedom and modular manufacturing capabilities afforded by 3D printing, the approach proposes an integrated water treatment system where an oil/water separator and a photodegradation module are assembled with solar evaporators to generate purified water for photovoltaic water splitting. This design aims to establish a conceptual framework that enables rapid iteration, collaborative innovation, and digital model&#8208;based standardization across the field.

This design aims to establish a conceptual framework that enables rapid iteration, collaborative innovation, and digital model-based standardization across the field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dry Transfer of CVD Graphene Film Using Adhesion Switchable Ferroelectric Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrostatic charge doping of graphene can tailor its adhesion to the copper surface, thus enabling etchant&#8208;free dry delamination. A switchable ferroelectric P(VDF&#8208;TrFE) film first acts as a graphene transfer support layer, where polarization controls adhesion to peel graphene from copper, and subsequently releases graphene onto SiO2 substrates upon depolarization. This method yields clean graphene with low crack density and is extendable to other 2D materials.








Abstract
Although chemical vapor deposition (CVD) produces meter&#8208;scale, high&#8208;quality graphene (Gr) on copper (Cu) foils, its practical integration is hampered by challenges in the transfer process. Conventional wet transfers are slow, produce chemical waste, and lack scalability, whereas existing dry transfer methods struggle with mechanical damage and residues due to strong Gr&#8208;Cu adhesion and the difficulty in precisely tuning interfacial forces. Here, a fully dry, industrially compatible transfer platform utilizing a ferroelectric poly(vinylidene&#8208;fluoride&#8208;trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF&#8208;TrFE)) film with electrostatically switchable adhesion, serving as both a mechanical support and a transfer layer, is demonstrated. Negative Corona poling of P(VDF&#8208;TrFE) induces p&#8208;type doping in graphene. Density Functional Theory calculations confirm that this simultaneously reduces Gr&#8208;Cu adhesion while increasing P(VDF&#8208;TrFE)&#8208;Gr adhesion, enabling clean, large&#8208;scale graphene delamination from Cu foils with &gt;99% coverage. Subsequent thermal annealing above P(VDF&#8208;TrFE)&#8217;s Curie temperature (&#8776;135&#160;&#176;C) depolarizes the film, neutralizing the interfacial charge for a clean release. The versatility of this method is shown for other two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials, including molybdenum disulfide and hexagonal boron nitride. Crucially, the process has been validated on cm&#8208;scale samples using a fully automated system with a transfer time of &lt;5 min, highlighting a viable path toward industrial&#8208;scale production of high&#8208;quality 2D material films.

         <title>Spatially Programmable Electroadhesive Enables In Situ Site&#8208;Selective Functional Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A light&#8208;activated, in situ spatially programmable bioadhesive (STICH) enables microscale, site&#8208;selective integration of bioelectronic devices with wet tissue. It achieves robust mechanical bonding and low&#8208;impedance electrical coupling, enabling reconfigurable neuromodulation and directional electromechanical sensing in vivo and ex vivo.








Abstract
Precise intraoperative integration of bioelectronic devices with wet tissue surfaces remains a challenge due to the limited spatial control of adhesion sites. Here, an in situ spatially programmable electrical bioadhesive (termed &#8220;STICH&#8221;)&#160;is reported that enables site&#8208;selective adhesion and functional coupling via light&#8208;activated bonding with wet biological tissue. Upon irradiation with patterned green light, Rose Bengal in a chitosan/silver nanowire hydrogel matrix generates singlet oxygen, which oxidizes amino acid residues into carbonyl groups on the tissue surface. The covalent bonding is then formed between the newly formed reactive carbonyl group and amine groups on chitosan. The spatially programmable adhesive allows robust tissue bonding with a lap&#8208;shear strength of 160&#160;kPa and precise adhesion regions at &#8776;2 &#181;m resolution. The light&#8208;patternable adhesive enables spatially resolved mechanical coupling for directional electromechanical sensing on ex vivo cardiac tissue. The low impedance adhesive interface also provides spatially programmed electrical coupling for in vivo neuromuscular stimulation on intraoperatively selected muscle groups. This platform advances microscale device&#8208;tissue integration and paves the way for reconfigurable bioelectronic therapies.

         <title>Self&#8208;Spiking Linear Neuromorphic Soft Pressure Sensor for Underwater Sensing Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a novel design of a neuromorphic pressure sensor that can generate self&#8208;spiking symmetric signals with direct event&#8208;based encoding through the integration of magnetic spheres and alternating coil circuits. The key advantages of this work include high linearity up to 200&#160;kPa (R2&#160;=&#160;0.997), self&#8208;spiking behavior for simplified signal processing, and robust underwater stability.








Abstract
Many aquatic vertebrates rely on neuromasts in their lateral line system to detect water vibrations and pressure gradients. These neuromasts contain specialized hair cells that function as mechanoreceptors, converting mechanical stimuli into electric signals for brain processing. While neuromorphic sensors can emulate biologic sensory systems, they are facing significant challenges in underwater stability and complex data processing. Here, a bioinspired neuromorphic soft pressure sensor designed for stable underwater performance and simplified signal processing is proposed. This is achieved through a novel integration of micro&#8208;magnetic spheres, a microfluidic channel, and alternating coil connections. This sensor exhibits self&#8208;spiking behavior upon applied force with high linearity (R2&#160;=&#160;0.997) in response to pressure changes up to 200&#160;kPa. The proposed mechanism generates distinct magnetic action potentials via its alternating coil design, enabling efficient signal processing. This artificial neuromast achieves 92.19% accuracy in game control applications and 94.71% accuracy in underwater object recognition using machine learning. Additionally, the sensor was validated in both experimental ocean basins and open&#8208;sea environments, confirming its potential for underwater robotics, ocean environmental monitoring, and marine industrial applications.

         <title>Zinc&#8208;Coordinated Trienzyme Nanogel Cascade Therapy for Accelerated Post&#8208;Pancreatectomy Cutaneous Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A zinc&#8208;coordinated nanogel assembly is reported that co&#8208;delivers three enzymes to regulate glucose, oxidative stress, and oxygen levels. This system mimics natural enzyme cascades to reprogram the wound environment after pancreatectomy. In a post&#8208;pancreatectomy mouse model, it accelerates healing by reducing infection, promoting blood vessel growth, and supporting tissue regeneration. The design offers a modular strategy for post&#8208;surgical therapy.








Abstract
Orchestration of enzyme cascades in synthetic systems remains a major challenge for catalytic control in complex biological environments. Here, a zinc&#8208;coordinated tri&#8208;enzyme nanogel system (Zn@nGSC) is reported that mimics natural enzymatic assemblies by confining individual glucose oxidase (GOX), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) within an imidazole&#8208;functionalized polymeric nanogel matrix. The nanogel is fabricated via mild in situ polymerization combined with Zn2&#8314;&#8208;imidazole coordination, yielding structurally stable multi&#8208;enzyme assemblies. The engineered assemblies demonstrate simultaneous preservation of enzymatic activity and enhanced cascade efficiency under thermal and proteolytic stress. Cascade reactions proceed as follows: i) glucose is depleted by GOX, ii) superoxide radicals are scavenged by SOD to alleviate oxidative stress, and iii) residual H2O2 is converted into oxygen by CAT in order to mitigate hypoxia. Functionally, Zn@nGSC restores redox balance and metabolic homeostasis, demonstrated in a murine model of post&#8208;pancreatectomy wound healing, with emphasis on treating hyperglycemia and improving regeneration. Another pronounced advantage of Zn@nGSC treatment is its antibacterial effect, which enhances angiogenesis, collagen deposition, and immune modulation. Overall, this modular nanoplatform provides a blueprint for designing robust, bioresponsive cascade systems with therapeutic potential in metabolically compromised microenvironments.

         <title>Reconfigurable Magnetotransport in MnBi2Te4 via Gate and Magnetic Field Tuning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gate&#8208;tunable magnetoresistance sign reversal under in&#8208;plane magnetic fields is observed in an ultrathin MnBi2Te4 device, arising from spin reorientation and distinct scattering mechanisms. Moreover, angular&#8208;dependent measurements reveal clear gate&#8208;controlled magnetotransport anisotropy, underscoring the strong coupling between gating, spin configuration, and transport behavior in MnBi2Te4.








Abstract
The intrinsic magnetic topological insulator MnBi2Te4 is a promising platform for exploring quantum phases with nontrivial band topology and for enabling electrical control over coupled magnetic and electronic phase transitions. In&#8208;plane magnetic fields, in particular, offer a distinct means of tuning these properties by strengthening quantized Hall effects, enhancing surface energy gaps, and driving spin reorientation transitions. However, a systematic understanding of how such fields affect magnetotransport is limited. Here, the magnetotransport behavior of few&#8208;layer MnBi2Te4 as a function of gate voltage, temperature, and magnetic field angle, with a primary focus on in&#8208;plane field effects, are investigated. A gate&#8208;tunable crossover in magnetoresistance is observed from positive to negative values under in&#8208;plane magnetic fields as the gate voltage is swept below the charge neutrality point at temperatures below the N&#233;el temperature. The in&#8208;plane field drives a transition from the antiferromagnetic ground state to a ferromagnetic configuration with spins aligned in&#8208;plane, while simultaneously altering the electronic structure, as revealed by gate&#8208;dependent transport features. The angle&#8208;dependent measurements reveal strongly gate&#8208;tunable magnetotransport anisotropy. These results establish in&#8208;plane magnetic fields as an effective tuning parameter for modulating spin and charge transport in MnBi2Te4, advancing prospects for reconfigurable spintronic and topological devices.

         <title>Rhus Chinensis &#8208; Inspired Vertical Hierarchical Structure for Solar &#8208; Driven All &#8208; Weather Co &#8208; Harvesting of Fresh Water, Clean Salts, and Authigenic Electricity</title>

The unsatisfactory outdoor performance and potential contamination of recovered products limit the wider practical deployment of interfacial solar evaporators. In response, we develop a Rhus chinensis &#8208; inspired vertical hierarchical structure (RVHS) to achieve all &#8208; weather extraction of fresh water, clean salt, and authigenic electricity.








Abstract
The escalating challenges in water, energy, and environmental sustainability necessitate the efficient utilization of diverse water sources, such as seawater and wastewater. Herein, a Rhus chinensis &#8208;inspired vertical hierarchical structure (RVHS) is developed to achieve all &#8208; weather extraction of fresh water, clean salt, and authigenic electricity. The RVHS achieves high water production rates of 5.07&#160;kg m&#8722;2 during the day and 2.04&#160;kg m&#8722;2 at night, approximately 1.2 times and 1.8 times those of conventional ones, respectively, by strategically&#160;manipulating phase change material (PCM) and heat storage. Simultaneously, it enables an enhanced salt recovery of 2.24&#160;kg m&#8722;2, yielding purified salt free from detectable contaminants (such as microplastics and persistent organic pollutants), facilitated by a pollutant capture trap integrated into the RVHS, a feature rarely explored in prior research. Furthermore, during salt recovery, the optimized salt concentration gradient can be further utilized for energy harvesting with high power output through thermodynamic optimization, which is approximately 60% greater than traditional devices. Further performance improvements can be realized by optimizing thermodynamic structures or integrating higher &#8208; performance materials. In conclusion, this work offers a universal routine for solar &#8208; driven resource recovery from seawater.

         <title>HZO/HSO Superlattice ReFET Array Integrating Optical Sensing for Neuromorphic Vision Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photonic ReFET array with an engineered HZO&#8211;HSO superlattice enables monolithic integration of optical sensing, nonvolatile memory, and synaptic computation. It exhibits forming&#8208;free, &gt;8&#8208;bit analog states, &gt;1010 endurance cycles, and light&#8208;tunable conductance. Integrated into a 20&#160;&#215;&#160;20 array, it achieves 94.45% accuracy on Fashion&#8208;MNIST in an in&#8208;sensor vision transformer.








Abstract
Neuromorphic vision systems require artificial synapses that integrate sensing, memory, and computation with high precision and stability. Conventional memristors face limitations including forming requirements, few multilevel states, low endurance, and poor integration density, while ferroelectric and flash&#8208;based transistors suffer trade&#8208;offs among endurance, retention, and switching ratio, and generally lack intrinsic photonic sensitivity, constraining in&#8208;sensor computing. Here, a photonic resistive&#8208;gate field&#8208;effect transistor (ReFET) array is presented that combines optical sensing, forming&#8208;free multilevel memory, and analog computation in a single device. The ReFET employs a Hf0.5Zr0.5O2/Hf0.95Sr0.05O2 (HZO/HSO) superlattice gate and an amorphous InGaZnO (IGZO) channel, achieving 272 stable conductance states (&gt;8&#8208;bit) in a 20&#160;&#215;&#160;20 array, ON/OFF ratios &gt;10&#8310;, endurance &gt;1010 cycles, and retention &gt;10&#8310;&#160;s. The array functions as an in&#8208;sensor optical convolutional layer, performing multiply&#8211;accumulate (MAC) operations with 94.45% accuracy on Fashion&#8208;MNIST using 8&#8208;bit quantized weights, while delivering high energy efficiency. This platform enables scalable, high&#8208;precision, energy&#8208;efficient photonic neuromorphic computing, integrating sensing, memory, and computation in one architecture.

         <title>3D Photonic Metacrystals with Enhanced Collective Mie Resonances for Dual Structural Coloration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents high&#8208;quality 3D CdS metacrystals with long&#8208;range order that suppress radiation losses, yielding 13&#8208;fold enhanced magnetic Mie resonances (Q = 17) and dual nonfading structural coloration. &#160; Wafer&#8208;scale inkjet printing using metafluid inks of CdS and ZnS nanoparticles demonstrates stable coloration and angle&#8208;sensitive hues F.








Abstract
3D photonic crystals offer nonfading structural coloration and complex optical properties through coupled Mie resonances in high&#8208;refractive&#8208;index materials. Although strong magnetic resonances make them promising, they often suffer from optical losses in the visible spectrum. Enhancing Mie resonances and quality factors through collective coupling in lithographically ordered arrays has been demonstrated. However, large&#8208;area applications using self&#8208;assembled colloidal resonators in metafluid inks have been limited by&#160;inadequate monodispersity and insufficient surface charge, hindering effective ordering. Here, we report high&#8208;quality 3D Mie&#8208;resonant metacrystals formed by high&#8208;temperature self&#8208;assembly of CdS nanoparticles (refractive index 2.5). Their long&#8208;range ordering attenuates local density of states overlapping with Mie resonances, minimizing external radiation losses and yielding&#160;one order of magnitude enhancement in collective Mie behavior. A 13&#8208;fold enhancement in magnetic Mie resonances with quality factors reaching 17 is experimentally demonstrated. The structures produce Bragg peaks that coexist with enhanced collective Mie resonances, enabling angle&#8208;dependent, dual nonfading structural coloration across the visible and near&#8208;infrared spectrum. As a proof of concept, wafer&#8208;scale inkjet printing using metafluid inks of CdS and ZnS nanoparticles demonstrates stable coloration and angle&#8208;sensitive hues. This work opens new avenues in durable structural coloration and multifunctional optical platforms for applications such as ultrasensitive polarimetry and advanced optical sensing.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Resorbable Magnetic Tunnel Junctions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bio&#8208;resorbable magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) is presented that combine on&#8208;demand data erasure, transient functionality, and biocompatibility, making them suitable for secure, short&#8208;lived electronics. Through dissolution studies under physiological conditions, this is demonstrated that MTJ functionality can be removed within 10 h. Moreover, the bio&#8208;resorbable lifetime can be tuned by selecting appropriate materials and adjusting the layer thickness of individual layers.








Abstract
Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) play a crucial role in spintronic applications, particularly data storage and sensors. Especially as a non&#8208;volatile memory, MTJs has received substantial attention due to its CMOS compatibility, low power consumption, fast switching speed, and high endurance. In parallel, bio&#8208;resorbable electronics have emerged as a promising solution for systems requiring temporary operation and secure data disposal, especially in military, intelligence, and biomedical systems where devices must safely disintegrate under physiological conditions. In this study, the bio&#8208;resorbability of MTJ is investigated by analyzing the dissolution behavior of its nanometer&#8208;thick constituent layers in phosphate&#8208;buffered saline solution at pH 7.4, simulating physiological environments. The MTJ structures, composed of bio&#8208;resorbable materials, exhibit well&#8208;controlled degradation behaviors. Critically, as one of the ferromagnetic layers dissolves, binary information is irreversibly lost, within 10 h of immersion. These findings highlight the potential of MTJs not only as high&#8208;performance memory elements but also as secure, transient data storage platforms. The ability to modify the dissolution lifetime by materials and thickness selection offers unique advantages for short&#8208;lived implantable devices, paving the way for integrating spintronic functionality into next&#8208;generation bioresorbable electronics.

         <title>Ce Single Atom&#8208;Engineered Amorphous/Crystalline Nanosheets for Enhanced Alkaline Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We leveraged Ce single&#8208;atom engineering to generate short&#8208;range ordered crystalline nanodomains in amorphous RuOx for creating amorphous/crystalline nanojunctions, in an effort to regulate the water dissociation kinetics for enhanced HER. Specifically, the Ce&#8208;doped crystalline nanodomains greatly reduce the energy barrier to water dissociation and possess optimal free energy for H* adsorption, which collectively contributes to the enhanced HER performance.








Abstract
Designing nanocatalysts with fast water dissociation kinetics is key to achieving the industrial current density of the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) for green hydrogen production via water electrolysis, which remains a grand challenge. Here, leverage single&#8208;atom engineering,a Ce single&#8208;atom&#8208;doped amorphous RuOx nanosheet featuring abundant amorphous/crystalline nanojunctions, namely, ac&#8208;CeSARuOx is successfully developed. When employed as a catalyst for alkaline HER, the ac&#8208;CeSARuOx catalyst displays an overpotential of only 8.3 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and Tafel slope as low as 23.1&#160;mV dec&#8722;1, outperforming the Ru&#8208;based catalysts reported in recent studies. Anion exchange&#8208;membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWEs) tests using ac&#8208;CeSARuOx as the cathode catalyst exhibit a low cell voltage of 1.71 V at 1000 mA cm&#8722;2, and the performance can be well maintained after 300 h. In situ spectroscopic analyses demonstrate the increased coverage of OH species on ac&#8208;CeSARuOx for enhanced water dissociation. Density function theory calculations suggest that the Ce&#8208;doped crystalline nanodomains in the amorphous/nanocrystalline nanojunction could effectively reduce the energy barrier to water dissociation, while the Ce&#8208;doped amorphous constituents regulate the H* adsorption, which collectively boost the HER performance. This work offers a new strategy to create amorphous/nanocrystalline nanojunctions in nanocatalysts for enhanced electrocatalysis.

         <title>Tailoring Graphite Interlayers with Electron&#8208;Acceptor Bridges Raises Ion Diffusion Kinetics for Ultrafast Charging Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present study systematically identifies and develops an electron&#8208;acceptor aluminum chloride pre&#8208;intercalation graphite. The pre&#8208;intercalated graphite builds C&#9472;Cl&#9472;Al&#9472;C electron&#8208;acceptor bridges within the graphite interlayers, which facilitate charge transfer kinetics during lithium&#8208;ion diffusion and storage, thereby enabling fast&#8208;charging performance in lithium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Sluggish solid&#8208;state diffusion kinetics of lithium ions is among the primary bottlenecks limiting the fast&#8208;charging performance of graphite anodes. Pre&#8208;intercalating molecules in graphite interlayers can tune the valence &#960;&#8208;electrons, but there are few systematic studies in designing such structures by electron coupling to optimize the charge transfer kinetics. Herein, deliberately guided by simulations, the present study identifies and develops a class of electron&#8208;acceptor aluminum chloride species for intercalation into graphite (AC&#8208;G), aiming to accelerate lithium ions charge transfer to the intercalated graphite through the formation of electron&#8208;acceptor bridges within the graphite interlayers. Consequently, the AC&#8208;G achieves a two&#8208;order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude enhancement in lithium ions diffusion coefficient (5.85 &#215; 10&#8722;7 cm2 s&#8722;1) compared to that in pristine graphite. It delivers stable cycling over 2000 cycles with a high areal capacity retention of 3.84 mAh cm&#8722;2 at 1C and maintains 500&#8208;cycle stability at 5C. Furthermore, an Ah&#8208;level pouch cell assembled with AC&#8208;G and cathode achieves an energy density of 285&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at 3C. The present work provides a new design strategy for graphite by introducing interlayer electron&#8208;bridging structures, offering valuable insights for next&#8208;generation fast&#8208;charging lithium&#8208;ion batteries

         <title>De&#8208;Saturation of Single&#8208;Atom Copper Catalysts for Accelerating Propargylic Substitution Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
De&#8208;saturation of copper&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts (De&#8208;sat SACs) are realized by a KOH&#8208;mediated Joule thermal shock strategy. Benefiting from the under&#8208;saturation coordination environment of single&#8208;atom Cu center, De&#8208;sat Cu SACs exhibit remarkable catalytic activity in propargylic substitution reactions, tolerating a broad range of nucleophiles (N&#8211;, C&#8211;, and O&#8211;), as well as diverse aryl, alkyl, tertiary, and cyclic propargylic carbonates.








Abstract
Rational design of proximal coordination microenvironments surrounding catalytic sites to achieve optimal reaction kinetics represents a paramount pursuit in single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), yet continues to pose substantial synthetic challenges. Developing innovative strategies that simultaneously stabilize low&#8208;coordinated single&#8208;metal species on solid supports, while ensuring atomic precision and high activity, remains imperative. Herein, a de&#8208;saturation strategy for SACs is demonstrated (denoted as De&#8208;sat SACs) using a top&#8208;down approach based on a KOH&#8208;mediated Joule thermal shock to obtain under&#8208;coordinated and asymmetric SACs for efficient organic synthesis. Using copper&#8208;based SACs as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the de&#8208;saturation strategy effectively converts the CuN4 to CuN3 configuration. The De&#8208;sat Cu SACs exhibit remarkable catalytic activity in propargylic substitution reactions, tolerating a broad range of nucleophiles (N&#8211;, C&#8211;, and O&#8211;), as well as diverse aryl, alkyl, tertiary, and cyclic propargylic carbonates. The coordination reduction in these De&#8208;sat SACs not only breaks the structural symmetry to enhance site accessibility but also elevates the energy of the dz2${d}_{{z}^{2}}$ orbital of Cu atom, thereby facilitating the formation of copper&#8211;alkynyl intermediates and boosting their catalytic performance. These findings establish a new platform for the rational design and synthesis of de&#8208;saturated yet stable SACs, facilitating challenging catalytic transformations toward sustainable chemical manufacturing.

         <title>Surface Energy&#8208;Confined Multi&#8208;Layer Inkjet Printing for Customizable Optical Microstructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surface energy&#8208;confined multi&#8208;layer inkjet printing strategy is developed for customizable fabrication of 3D optical microstructures. By combining interfacial energy confinement with layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer processing, various 3D curved optical microstructures with tailorable morphology, material composition, and spatial configuration are precisely fabricated and integrated, offering great promise for applications in miniaturized optical systems, multi&#8208;dimensional imaging, and high&#8208;security encryption.








Abstract
Inkjet printing emerges as a versatile on&#8208;demand patterning technique for additive manufacturing of optical microstructures, yet its ability to regulate the ink droplet morphology is constrained by the intrinsic interplay between ink&#8208;substrate wetting conditions, thereby hindering the customizable fabrication of 3D microstructures. Here, a surface energy&#8208;confined multi&#8208;layer inkjet printing strategy is developed for precisely fabricating curved optical microstructures with tunable size, solid angle, and configuration. The strategy is implemented through custom&#8208;engineered layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer printing on a pre&#8208;patterned substrate with spatially defined interfacial energy barriers, enabling the precise construction and integration of distinct optical microdomes (characterized by substrate attachment and uniform curved profiles) at the microscale. Notably, the strategy facilitates the high&#8208;throughput printing of diverse topological microdomes, ranging from triangular to hexagonal architectures. The as&#8208;fabricated microdomes, featuring precisely engineered morphology and sub&#8208;nanometer surface roughness, exhibit integrated light&#8208;field manipulation capabilities and unique multifocal characteristics, highlighting their potential for miniaturized optical systems and intelligent imaging devices. Beyond UV&#8208;cured polymers, this methodology is extendable to nanomaterial&#8208;based micro&#8208;3D printing (e.g., colloidal photonic crystal microdomes), opening avenues for more sophisticated optical functionalities. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, a non&#8208;imaging multidimensional encryption platform is printed leveraging 3D morphology&#8208;tailored optical readout.

The emerging galvanic&#8208;cell&#8208;based self&#8208;powered bioelectronics for biomedical applications with passive and active control strategies are summarized. In addition, the challenges and opportunities for galvanic devices are also discussed.








Abstract
Bioelectronic devices hold significant promise for advancing biomedical technologies, addressing critical healthcare challenges, and improving the quality of human life. Conventional bioelectronic devices are typically powered by external, bulky batteries connected by extended electrical wires, which limit the compactness and miniaturization of bioelectronics, restrict patient mobility, and increase the risk of complications such as infections and device&#8208;related failures. This perspective discusses the emerging concept of galvanic&#8208;cell&#8208;based self&#8208;powered bioelectronic devices, in which galvanic electrodes serve directly as the tissue&#8208;contacting interfaces. We provide an overview of the principles and working mechanisms of biocompatible galvanic cells in galvanic devices for diverse biomedical applications, including electrical modulation, chemical and biochemical modulation, and hybrid electrical/(bio)chemical modulation, along with their control strategies: passive control and active control. Furthermore, we envision that the advancement of galvanic devices will represent a promising direction for biomedical applications, despite the presence of inherent challenges.

         <title>Materials Design and Assessment of Redox&#8208;Mediated Flow Cell Systems for Enhanced Energy Storage and Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox&#8208;mediated flow cells, which operate on an electrochemical&#8208;chemical cycle, shift desired reactions from electrode compartments to dedicated reactors and enable diversified applications for high&#8208;density flow batteries, fuel cells, CO2 capture, electrosynthesis, waste recycling, etc. This perspective outlines the material selection criteria, evaluation methods, and targeted design strategies toward next&#8208;generation applications.








Abstract
The transition toward sustainable energy systems necessitates innovations that overcome the limitations of conventional electrochemical systems. Redox&#8208;mediated flow cell systems emerge as a transformative paradigm by decoupling energy storage, conversion, and chemical processes from traditional electrode&#8208;bound reactions. These systems employ soluble redox mediators to shuttle electrons between electrodes and spatially separated reactive phases (solid, liquid, or gas), thereby enabling unprecedented operational flexibility and scalability. This standpoint underscores the adaptability of redox&#8208;mediated electrified systems across a range of applications, encompassing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density redox targeting&#8208;based flow batteries, fuel cells, electrified CO2 capture, sustainable chemical synthesis, waste recycling, etc. The rational design of redox&#8208;active materials is central to their success, with precise alignment of redox potentials, enhanced electron&#8208;transfer kinetics, and robust stability underpinning performance. The challenges of new materials development, system durability, and cost&#8208;effectiveness can be addressed through advances in experimental measurement, computational modeling, operando characterization, and interdisciplinary collaboration. Moving forward, the integration of redox&#8208;mediated technologies with renewable energy systems and industrial processes is predicted to transform energy and chemical landscapes. The integration of laboratory innovations with real&#8208;world deployment facilitates a pathway to decarbonization, resource efficiency, and the circular economy. This perspective emphasizes the pivotal functions of redox&#8208;mediated architectures in fostering a robust, electrified future, where the convergence of energy storage, environmental stewardship, and sustainable chemical production is pivotal in addressing global challenges.

         <title>Precise Surface Engineering of Metal Nanoclusters: Ligand Programming for Functionality Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ligand programming offers a precise strategy to tune metal nanocluster surfaces at the atomic level. By controlling metal&#8208;ligand coordination, intra/inter&#8208;ligand interactions, and interfacial chemistry, this approach enables customizable structures with enhanced catalytic, optical, and biomedical functions. This work highlights how precise surface engineering transforms metal nanoclusters into smart platforms for next&#8208;generation materials.








Abstract
Precise surface engineering of metal nanoclusters (MNCs) has emerged as a powerful strategy for tailoring their structural, electronic, and catalytic properties. On the basis of traditional surface chemistry, ligand programming enables atomic&#8208;level control over MNC functionality by modulating metal&#8208;ligand coordination, intra/inter&#8208;ligand interactions, and interfacial chemistry. These three layers within the &#8220;Engineering Zone&#8221; define structural flexibility, charge transfer pathways, molecular rigidity, and surface accessibility, key factors in optimizing catalytic activity, luminescence efficiency, and molecular recognition. This Perspective explores the chemistry governing ligand&#8208;directed MNC behavior in the three layers, highlighting its role in catalysis, photonics, and biomedicine. By integrating coordination chemistry, intra/inter&#8208;ligand design, and interfacial interactions, how ligand programming transforms MNCs is demonstrated into tunable platforms for next&#8208;generation functional materials. Insights from MNCs also provide a model for advancing surface engineering in broader nanomaterials, paving the way for innovative applications in materials science.

         <title>Designing Physical Unclonable Functions From Optically Active Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 49, December 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Assigning unforgeable &#8220;fingerprints&#8221; to manufactured goods is a key strategy to fight global counterfeiting. Optical physical unclonable functions (PUFs) are chemically generated random patterns of optically active materials serving as unique authenticators. Here, recent advances in optical PUF devices are presented for anticounterfeiting via an overview of available optical taggants and compatible fabrication techniques.








Abstract
Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) are artificial &#8220;fingerprints&#8221; provided by physical devices to authenticate manufactured goods. Their inherent unclonable nature positions them as one of the most promising tools to tackle global counterfeiting challenges. Leveraging the large parameter space in solution chemistry, chemically generated PUFs can achieve excellent device performance. Particularly, optically active materials have become valuable security inks thanks to their versatile, non&#8208;invasive, and non&#8208;destructive readouts, and PUF devices generated from stochastic nano&#8208;/micro&#8208;patterns of optical inks hold great potential. This review highlights recent advances in the design of optical PUF devices. A range of resonant and non&#8208;resonant optical materials used as security taggants are presented and their incorporation in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art PUF devices is examined using non&#8208;deterministic fabrication techniques. By outlining design criteria, challenges, and opportunities, a roadmap is provided for developing next&#8208;generation PUFs using established and emerging optical probes and help advance security and reliability in anticounterfeiting technologies.

Abstract
The field of nanophotonics has seen remarkable advances, with gold&#8208;based materials standing out. By precisely fine&#8208;tuning the size and shape of metal nanoparticles (NPs), such as gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), it has been possible to gain control over light interaction, modulating localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), a phenomenon that involves the collective oscillation of free conduction electrons. This has opened the path toward more powerful biomedical applications, including surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and photothermal therapy (PTT). When AuNPs dimensions fall below 2 nm, they become gold nanoclusters (AuNCs), losing the LSPR but acquitting fluorescence due to their molecule&#8208;like behavior. This unique feature makes them ideal for high&#8208;resolution imaging, biomarker detection, and advanced therapies. Beyond traditional uses, the recent inclusion of AuNPs into nanomotors (NMs) enhances precise in vivo tracking and targeted drug delivery. This review highlights the different applications of plasmonic nanomaterials with particular emphasis on AuNPs and AuNCs as a function of their shapes, sizes, and stabilization ligands. Moreover, it dives into the biosensing applications of plasmonic materials by addressing their so&#8208;called far&#8208;field and near&#8208;field optical properties, giving a detailed overview of different high&#8208;sensitivity immunoassays and biosensing. A comprehensive outlook on the evolution of plasmonic&#8208;based materials for the next therapies is provided.

         <title>Unperceivable Designs of Wearable Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 49, December 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unperceivable wearable technologies seamlessly integrate into everyone's daily life, for healthcare and Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things applications. By remaining completely unnoticed both visually and tactilely, by the user and others, they ensure medical privacy and allow natural social interactions. Herein are introduced recent strategies employed at material, design, and integration levels to reach unperceivable technologies, whether through transparent materials or strategically hidden devices.








Abstract
Wearable smart electronics are taking an increasing part of the consumer electronics market, with applications in advanced healthcare systems, entertainment, and Internet of Things. The advanced development of flexible, stretchable, and breathable electronic materials has paved the way to comfortable and long&#8208;term wearables. However, these devices can affect the wearer's appearance and draw attention during use, which may impact the wearer's confidence and social interactions, making them difficult to wear on a daily basis. Apart from comfort, one key condition for user acceptance is that these new technologies seamlessly integrate into our daily lives, remaining unperceivable to others. In this review, strategies to minimize the visual impact of wearable devices and make them more suitable for daily use are discussed. These new devices focus on being unperceivable when worn and comfortable enough that users almost forget their presence, reducing psychological discomfort while maintaining accuracy in signal collection. Materials selection is crucial for developing long&#8208;term and unperceivable wearable devices. Recent developments in these unperceivable electronic devices are also covered, including sensors, transistors, and displays, and mechanisms to achieve unperceivability are discussed. Finally, the potential applications are summarized and the remaining challenges and prospects are discussed.

         <title>Selective Lipolysis by Photoactivation of Chaperone&#8208;Mediated Autophagy Using Adipocyte Membrane&#8208;Coated Nanoparticle in Hydrogel</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 49, December 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adipocyte membrane&#8208;coated nanoparticles loaded with rosiglitazone in hydrogel offer an alternative approach to conventional obesity treatments. This system selectively targets adipocytes, inducing lipolysis by activating chaperone&#8208;mediated autophagy through mild photothermal stimulation. Demonstrating significant weight loss in animal models, this nanomaterial&#8208;based strategy holds promise for obesity management and other autophagy&#8208;related disorders.








Abstract
Despite the clinical importance of obesity, treatments have been confined to surgery or drugs, both of which carry adverse effects. Herein a nanomaterial consisting of adipocyte membrane&#8208;coated and rosiglitazone&#8208;loaded polydopamine nanoparticles embedded in hydrogel (ARNP&#8208;H) is designed aiming to induce selective lipolysis in adipocyte through activation of chaperone&#8208;mediated autophagy (CMA) by mild photothermal heat stress. Adipocyte membrane&#8208;coated and rosiglitazone&#8208;loaded polydopamine nanoparticles (ARNP) are taken up by adipocyte to a significantly greater extent than other cell membrane&#8208;coated nanoparticles. Adipocyte interactions with ARNP are significantly higher than those with other cells such as macrophages and T cells. ARNP&#8208;H enabled selective activation of CMA in adipocytes, increasing levels of heat shock cognate protein 70, a key component of CMA. Colocalization of heat shock cognate protein 70 and breakdown of CMA substrate perilipin 2, led to enhancement of adipose triglyceride lipase access to lipid droplets, initiating lipolysis. In high&#8208;fat diet&#8208;fed mice, ARNP&#8208;H retention at the local injection site is greater than in other groups, maintaining photothermal responsiveness for over 3 days. ARNP&#8208;H treatment significantly enhanced adipocyte lipolysis and led to substantial weight loss. While this study focuses on obesity model, ARNP&#8208;H for CMA photoactivation holds potential for treating other diseases associated with autophagy dysregulation.

         <title>Wideband Tuning and Deep&#8208;Tissue Spectral Detection of Indium Phosphide Nano&#8208;Laser Particles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 49, December 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces indium phosphide (InP) nanolaser particles operating in the near&#8208;infrared&#8208;I (NIR&#8208;I) spectrum, with ultrawide tunability (740&#8211;970&#160;nm) and nanometer&#8208;scale linewidths. Optimized for deep&#8208;tissue imaging and multiplexed barcoding, these particles offer excellent stability, high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios in scattering media, and biocompatibility, making them highly promising for advanced biomedical research and applications.








Abstract
Laser particles (LPs) emitting narrowband spectra across wide spectral ranges are highly promising for high&#8208;multiplex optical barcoding of biological cells. Here, LPs based on indium phosphide (InP) nanodisks are presented, operating in the near&#8208;infrared wavelength range of 740&#8211;970&#160;nm. Utilizing low&#8208;order whispering gallery resonance modes in size&#8208;tuned nanodisks, an ultrawide color palette with 25% spectral utilization and nanometer&#8208;scale linewidth is achieved. A simple theoretical model accurately predicts spectral ranges based on particle size. The minimum laser size is 430&#160;nm in air and 560&#160;nm within cells, operating at mode orders of 4 or 5. The high brightness and narrow linewidths of polymer&#8208;silica&#8208;protected InP LPs, combined with a silicon&#8208;detector spectrometer, enable spectral detection of laser peaks with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratios in highly&#8208;scattering media, including 1&#8208;cm&#8208;thick chicken breast tissue and blood vessels in live mice.

Mechanoresponsive color&#8208;changing materials that can reversibly and resiliently change color in response to stress are highly desirable for diverse technologies in optics, sensors, and robots; however, such materials are rarely achieved. This work reports a fatigue&#8208;resistant mechanoresponsive color&#8208;changing hydrogel that exhibits reversible, resilient, and predictable color changes under mechanical stress, for tactile robots by translating tactile sensations into visual images.









Abstract
Mechanoresponsive color&#8208;changing materials that can&#160;reversibly&#160;and resiliently change color in response to mechanical deformation are highly desirable for diverse modern technologies in optics, sensors, and robots; however, such materials are rarely achieved. Here, a fatigue&#8208;resistant mechanoresponsive color&#8208;changing hydrogel (FMCH) is reported that exhibits reversible, resilient, and predictable color changes under mechanical stress. At its undeformed state, the FMCH remains dark under a circular polariscope; upon uniaxial stretching of up to six times its initial length, it gradually shifts its color from black, to gray, yellow, and purple. Unlike traditional mechanoresponsive color&#8208;changing materials, FMCH maintains its performance across various strain rates for up to 10 000 cycles. Moreover, FMCH demonstrates superior mechanical properties with fracture toughness of 3000 J m&#8722;2, stretchability of 6, and fatigue threshold up to 400 J m&#8722;2. These exceptional mechanical and optical features are attributed to FMCH's substantial molecular entanglements and desirable hygroscopic salts, which synergistically enhance its mechanical toughness while preserving its color&#8208;changing performance.

&lt;p&gt;Mechanoresponsive color-changing materials that can reversibly and resiliently change color in response to stress are highly desirable for diverse technologies in optics, sensors, and robots; however, such materials are rarely achieved. This work reports a fatigue-resistant mechanoresponsive color-changing hydrogel that exhibits reversible, resilient, and predictable color changes under mechanical stress, for tactile robots by translating tactile sensations into visual images.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mechanoresponsive color-changing materials that can&#160;reversibly&#160;and resiliently change color in response to mechanical deformation are highly desirable for diverse modern technologies in optics, sensors, and robots; however, such materials are rarely achieved. Here, a fatigue-resistant mechanoresponsive color-changing hydrogel (FMCH) is reported that exhibits reversible, resilient, and predictable color changes under mechanical stress. At its undeformed state, the FMCH remains dark under a circular polariscope; upon uniaxial stretching of up to six times its initial length, it gradually shifts its color from black, to gray, yellow, and purple. Unlike traditional mechanoresponsive color-changing materials, FMCH maintains its performance across various strain rates for up to 10 000 cycles. Moreover, FMCH demonstrates superior mechanical properties with fracture toughness of 3000 J m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, stretchability of 6, and fatigue threshold up to 400 J m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. These exceptional mechanical and optical features are attributed to FMCH's substantial molecular entanglements and desirable hygroscopic salts, which synergistically enhance its mechanical toughness while preserving its color-changing performance. One application of this FMCH as a tactile sensoris then demonstrated for vision-based tactile robots, enabling them to discern material stiffness, object shape, spatial location, and applied pressure by translating stress distribution on the contact surface into discernible images.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multifunctional Neural Probes Enable Bidirectional Electrical, Optical, and Chemical Recording and Stimulation In Vivo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 49, December 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Convergence drawing is used to create flexible, microscale, multifunctional fiber&#8208;based neural probes. Optimized materials selection enables individual devices to perform neural recording, electrical stimulation, optogenetics, fiber photometry, fluid delivery, and voltammetric neurotransmitter detection in rodents. These bidirectional tools may permit multimodal interrogation of neural signaling across multiple brain regions in mechanistic and translational studies.








Abstract
Recording and modulation of neuronal activity enables the study of brain function in health and disease. While translational neuroscience relies on electrical recording and modulation techniques, mechanistic studies in rodent models leverage genetic precision of optical methods, such as optogenetics and fluorescent indicator imaging. In addition to electrical signal transduction, neurons produce and receive diverse chemical signals which motivate tools to probe and modulate neurochemistry. Although the past decade has delivered a wealth of technologies for electrophysiology, optogenetics, chemical sensing, and optical recording, combining these modalities within a single platform remains challenging. This work leverages materials selection and convergence fiber drawing to permit neural recording, electrical stimulation, optogenetics, fiber photometry, drug and gene delivery, and voltammetric recording of neurotransmitters within individual fibers. Composed of polymers and non&#8208;magnetic carbon&#8208;based conductors, these fibers are compatible with magnetic resonance imaging, enabling concurrent stimulation and whole&#8208;brain monitoring. Their utility is demonstrated in studies of the mesolimbic reward pathway by interfacing with the ventral tegmental area and nucleus accumbens in mice and characterizing the neurophysiological effects of a stimulant drug. This study highlights the potential of these fibers to probe electrical, optical, and chemical signaling across multiple brain regions in both mechanistic and translational studies.

         <title>Deeply Implantable, Shape&#8208;Morphing, 3D MicroLEDs for Pancreatic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 49, December 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work is deeply implantable, shape&#8208;morphing 3D microLEDs (SMLED) for mPDT, tailored to solid pancreatic tumor models with irregular and dynamically changing sizes. The device, based on a shape morphing, enables tumor&#8208;specific and continuous light irradiation. This approach results in significant PDAC volume reduction and modifications within the tumor microenvironment without adverse effects on surrounding tissues. This work represents a promising advancement in anticancer phototherapy, offering a safe, adaptable, and targeted approach for mPDT that can adjust to tumor volume changes.








Abstract
Controlled photooxidation&#8208;mediated disruption of collagens in the tumor microenvironment can reduce desmoplasia and enhance immune responsiveness. However, achieving effective light delivery to solid tumors, particularly those with dynamic volumetric changes like pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), remains challenging and limits the repeated and sustained photoactivation of drugs. Here, 3D, shape&#8208;morphing, implantable photonic devices (IPDs) are introduced that enable tumor&#8208;specific and continuous light irradiation for effective metronomic photodynamic therapy (mPDT). This IPD adheres seamlessly to the surface of orthotopic PDAC tumors, mitigating issues related to mechanical mismatch, delamination, and internal lesions. In freely moving mouse models, mPDT using the IPD with close adhesion significantly reduces desmoplastic tumor volume without causing cytotoxic effects in healthy tissues. These promising in vivo results underscore the potential of an adaptable and unidirectional IPD design in precisely targeting cancerous organs, suggesting a meaningful advance in light&#8208;based therapeutic technologies.

         <title>Robust Full&#8208;Surface Bonding of Substrate and Electrode for Ultra&#8208;Flexible Sensor Integration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 49, December 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A direct hybrid bonding method that enables both gold and parylene bonding without adhesives is developed. This technique achieves full&#8208;surface direct bonding of electrodes and substrates in flexible electronic connections. The method offers high flexibility, stable mechanical durability, and high&#8208;resolution interconnections, accommodating varying electrode shapes and sizes in flexible electronic applications.








Abstract
The integration of multiple flexible electronics is crucial for the development of ultra&#8208;flexible wearable and implantable devices. To fabricate an integrated system, robust and flexible bonding throughout the connection area, irrespective of the electrode or substrate, is needed. Conventional methods for flexible direct bonding have primarily been confined to metal electrodes or substrate&#8208;only bonding due to varying material properties. Consequently, the mechanical and electrical properties of the connections deteriorate based on their shape and size. This study introduces a bonding technique for wearable electronics, achieving strong, flexible connections between materials like gold and parylene at a low temperature (85&#160;&#176;C). This hybrid direct bonding method ensures strong bonding across both the Au electrode and parylene substrate within electronic interconnections. Additionally, a 3D&#8208;stacked flexible structure that maintains robustness and high flexibility without an adhesive layer is successfully developed. An ultrathin photoplethysmography sensor developed by stacking an ultrathin organic photodetector atop an organic light&#8208;emitting diode is demonstrated. Unlike traditional methods requiring adhesives or high pressure, this approach maintains flexibility essential for deformation, withstanding bending at a radius of 0.5&#160;mm. The technique's robustness suggests promising applications in durable, ultra&#8208;flexible electronics integration.

         <title>Upconversion Nanoparticle&#8208;Covalent Organic Framework Core&#8211;shell Particles as Therapeutic Microrobots Trackable With Optoacoustic Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 49, December 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upconversion nanoparticle&#8208;covalent organic framework core&#8211;shell particles provide enhanced contrast for optoacoustic imaging by leveraging the optical absorption of upconversion luminescence within the covalent organic framework matrix. Beyond their role as contrast agents, these particles enable customizable therapeutic agent loading and release, as well as magnetic microrobotic steering within vascular environments.








Abstract
Despite the development of various medical imaging contrast agents, integrating contrast signal generation with therapeutic and microrobotic functions remains challenging without complicated fabrication processes. In this study, upconversion nanoparticle&#8208;covalent organic framework (UCNP&#8208;COF) core&#8211;shell sub&#8208;micron particles are developed that function as therapeutic microrobots trackable with multi&#8208;spectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) imaging and can be loaded with desired therapeutic molecular agents in a customizable manner. The mechanism of optoacoustic signal generation in UCNP&#8208;COF particles is attributed to the quenching of upconversion luminescence emitted by the UCNPs, which is absorbed by the encapsulating COF and subsequently converted into acoustic waves. Unlike other microparticulate agents previously imaged with MSOT, UCNP&#8208;COF particles do not pose concerns about their stability and biocompatibility. Simultaneously, the mesoporous texture of the COF provides a large surface area, allowing for the efficient loading of various drug molecules, which can be released at target sites. Furthermore, the magnetic UCNP&#8208;COF Janus particles can be magnetically navigated through in vivo vasculature while being visualized in real&#8208;time with volumetric MSOT. This study proposes an approach to design photonic materials with multifunctionality, enabling high&#8208;performance medical imaging, drug delivery, and microrobotic manipulation toward their future potential clinical use.

         <title>Multifunctional Photonic Nanomaterials and Devices for Digital Photomedicine via Neuro&#8208;Immune Cross&#8208;Talks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 49, December 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Perspective covers photonic nanomaterials and devices currently used in photobiomodulation and optogenetics for digitally controlled neurostimulation, providing the potential for neuro&#8208;immune interactions.








Abstract
The nervous and immune systems are closely interconnected, and influence the onset and progress of various diseases. Accordingly, understanding the interaction of the neural system and the immune system becomes very important for the treatment of intractable diseases with the analysis of therapeutic mechanisms, such as autoimmune diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, cancers, and so on. The conventional immunomodulation treatments have been mainly carried out by drug administration, but they have suffered from systemic negative side&#8208;effects with only limited effects on the specific disease. In this Perspective, photonic nanomaterials and devices are reviewed and discussed for digitally controlled neurostimulating photomedicine via photobiomodulation and optogenetics from the unique viewpoint of neuro&#8208;immune cross&#8208;talks. The prospects and perspectives to integrate photonic nanomaterials with advanced wearable and implantable healthcare devices are also provided and highlighted to revolutionize the therapeutic strategies by the interaction of neural and immune systems, and optimize the treatment protocols for futuristic digital photomedicine. This approach will revolutionize the fields of neurostimulation and immune regulation for further clinical applications.

Alleviating Atherosclerosis via Sonocatalytic Therapy
A dual enzyme&#8208;mimicking and ultrasound&#8208;responsive Nb2C&#8208;Pt@HA&#8208;PEG nanozyme efficiently eliminates ROS in the atherosclerotic microenvironment and performs anti&#8208;inflammatory capability under ultrasound irradiation. Nb2C&#8208;Pt@HA&#8208;PEG&#8208;mediated sonocatalytic therapy (SCT) exerts an outstanding anti&#8208;atherosclerosis efficacy by regulating intraplaque redox homeostasis, contributing to lesional shrinkage and a more stable plaque phenotype in plaque&#8208;bearing mice. More details can be found in the Research Article by Jianhua Hao and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202420189).

         <title>Engineering Framework Materials in Water Systems for Targeted Ion Extraction and Spontaneous Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through comprehensive analysis of framework materials in ion extraction, osmotic energy conversion, and evaporative energy harvesting, this review establishes interdisciplinary connections centered on ion&#8208;selective transport mechanisms across these applications and identifies critical challenges and knowledge gaps in existing studies.








Abstract
Developing techniques that can extract required salt resources and harvest spontaneous energy from natural water environment is essential to promote the global decarbonization and electrification. Construction of advanced framework materials with intrinsic nanochannels has been considered the most promising solution to implement this technique owing to the specific fluid transport performances in such confined space. However, this design requires a deep understanding of the structural properties of framework material nanochannels in different scenarios, as well as the corresponding construction strategies. Consequently, it is an urgent necessity to elucidate the specific ion capture behavior and fluid transport mechanism in these framework materials to build targeted nanofluidic systems for guiding developments in water related resources and energy acquisition technologies. Herein, the recent advances in ion extraction and energy harvesting based on metal&#8208;organic framework and covalent&#8208;organic framework materials have been outlined, along with the discussion about the nanochannels specificity by combining ions and fluid properties and nanochannel structures. Finally, an outlook to trends, challenges and emerging opportunities is given to foresee the future developments in this important field.

The outlook section emphasizes future opportunities for advanced magnetization modulation technologies in magnetic soft materials.








Abstract
Recent decades have witnessed significant advancements in the exploration of magnetic soft materials, driven by diverse fabrication techniques and the demands of various applications. This progress can mainly be attributed to the unique properties of magnetic soft materials, including their untethered and low&#8208;latency manipulation characteristics as well as mechanical compliance. Spatiotemporal magnetization modulation is fundamentally crucial in magnetic soft materials, as it governs the magnetic body forces and torques for self&#8208;actuation, as well as the generation of magnetic fields for external interaction. Despite remarkable progress in magnetic soft materials, a comprehensive review focusing on spatiotemporal magnetization modulation is lacking. This review begins by introducing fundamental components of magnetic soft materials and then explores various strategies for achieving spatial and spatiotemporal modulation of magnetization. Finally, an overview is provided of the typical applications in fluid manipulation, biomedical engineering, and wearable electronics based on magnetization&#8208;modulated magnetic soft materials, along with perspectives on future advancements.

         <title>Personal Moisture Management by Advanced Textiles and Intelligent Wearables</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores advancements in personal moisture management (PMM) through advanced textiles and intelligent wearables, evolving from traditional methods like wicking and evaporation to cutting&#8208;edge innovations such as directional water transport, stimuli&#8208;responsive textiles, and AI&#8208;driven wearables. It also highlights PMM&#8208;enabled applications in health monitoring, energy harvesting, and thermoregulation, while addressing challenges in durability, scalability, and adaptability with intelligent, sustainable solutions.








Abstract
As global climate change intensifies, personal moisture management (PMM) is increasingly crucial for regulating body temperature and near&#8208;skin humidity, sustaining comfort, health, and productivity. Advances in textile materials and wearable technologies are moving PMM beyond traditional wicking&#8208;drying and waterproof&#8208;breathable designs toward directional sweat transport, stimuli&#8208;responsive control, and integration with personal thermal management (PTM). Advanced textiles and intelligent wearables enable more efficient, adaptive PMM; meanwhile, effective PMM enhances sensing performance and long&#8208;term comfort of wearable systems, and supports sweat&#8208;based health monitoring and energy harvesting, forming closed&#8208;loop, intelligent comfort&#8208;health&#8208;performance ecosystems. This review critically discusses PMM mechanisms and designs from capillary wicking and evaporation/diffusion to directional water transport and responsive moisture regulation, alongside manufacturing strategies spanning advanced fibers, nanoengineering, bioinspired architectures, smart polymers, and wearable electronics. PMM&#8208;enabled implementations in health monitoring and energy harvesting are introduced, and elucidate coupled moisture&#8208;heat transport to guide the co&#8208;optimization of PMM and PTM. Finally, key challenges are outlined, including sweat accumulation, reduced durability and washability, limited manufacturing scalability, and insufficient cross&#8209;scenario adaptability, and offer potential solutions, particularly AI&#8209;enabled pathways for intelligent, sustainable, next&#8209;generation PMM textiles and wearables.

This study reviews the latest advancements in broadband PDs utilizing heterostructures that combine 2D semimetals with materials of various dimensions and highlights their applications in optoelectronics.








Abstract
Hybrid heterostructures are pivotal in the advanced broadband detection technology. The emergence of 2D semimetals has expanded the range of materials in heterostructures beyond conventional narrow&#8208;gap materials for room&#8208;temperature broadband detection applications due to their extraordinary optical and electrical properties. This review outlines the cutting&#8208;edge and latest advancements in broadband photodetectors (PDs) engineered from heterostructures that synergistically combine 2D semimetals with several different dimensional materials. It begins with a fundamental investigation, offering an in&#8208;depth explanation of the essential material properties and a summary of synthesis methodologies. Then, the discussion advances to provide an analytical overview of the categorization, underlying photodetection mechanism, and figures&#8208;of&#8208;merit of these advanced PDs. Subsequently, the narrative shifts to a comprehensive analysis of heterogeneous integrated devices. The review further highlights the diverse optoelectronic applications of broadband PDs, spanning image sensing, optical communication, position&#8208;sensitive detection, integrated sensing and computing, spintronics, and computational spectroscopy are thoroughly highlighted. Finally, the review concludes by addressing the challenges and opportunities in advancing 2D semimetal materials for photodetection.

         <title>Advanced Air Electrodes for Reversible Protonic Ceramic Electrochemical Cells: A Comprehensive Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible protonic ceramic electrochemical cells (R&#8208;PCECs) face challenges from sluggish and unstable oxygen reduction and evolution reactions in the air electrode. This review discusses recent progress in triple&#8208;conducting air electrodes, emphasizing mechanisms, performance factors, and design strategies, offering guidance for creating efficient and stable air electrode materials for R&#8208;PCECs.








Abstract
Reversible protonic ceramic electrochemical cells (R&#8208;PCECs) have great potential for efficient and clean power generation, energy storage, and sustainable synthesis of high&#8208;value chemicals. However, the sluggish and unstable kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in the air electrode hinder the R&#8208;PCEC development. Durable H+/e&#8722;/O2&#8722; triple&#8208;conducting air electrode materials are promising for enhancing reaction kinetics and improving catalytical stability. This review synthesizes the recent progress in triple&#8208;conducting air electrodes, focusing on their working mechanisms, including electrode kinetics, lattice and its defect structure in oxides, and the generation and transport processes of H+, O2&#8722;, and e&#8722;. It also examines the required physicochemical properties and their influencing factors. By synthesizing and critically analyzing the latest theoretical frameworks, advanced materials, and regulation strategies, this review outlines the challenges and prospects shaping the future of R&#8208;PCEC technology and air electrode development. Based on these theories and multiple strategies about the bulk triple conducting properties and surface chemical states, this review provides practical guidance for the rational design and development of efficient and stable air electrode materials for R&#8208;PCECs and related electrocatalytic materials.

         <title>Recent Advances in Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ubiquitous defects predominately account for photo&#8208;instability and open&#8208;circuit voltage losses in wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells (WBG PSCs). This review comprehensively presents the underlying impact mechanisms, summarizes the advanced optimization strategies across various functional layers and their interfaces to develop efficient and stable WBG PSCs, and evaluates their performance in semitransparent solar cells, tandem solar cells, and indoor photovoltaic applications.








Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have garnered considerable attention of late for their potential as semitransparent photovoltaics for building integration, top&#8208;cells in tandem configurations, and indoor photovoltaics (IPVs) for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. However, recent investigations have unveiled that underlying defect&#8208;mediated phase segregation, ion migration, lattice strain, and other factors can give rise to self&#8208;accelerated degradation reactions and the contraction of quasi&#8208;Fermi level splitting (QFLS) within devices. Extensive efforts have been undertaken to reduce defect densities in bulks, at surfaces, and across interfaces with charge transport layers (CTLs). This review provides a timely and comprehensive understanding of the intrinsic defect ecosystem in WBG perovskites, and mechanistically elucidates their impacts on device stability and open circuit voltage losses. Subsequently, recent advances in defect passivation strategies are cross&#8208;sectionally overviewed, covering various components of devices. The applications of WBG PSCs in semitransparent devices, tandem applications, and IPVs are discussed. Finally, prospects and challenges are proposed, providing insights for future research and technological advancements.

         <title>Challenges and Opportunities of Upconversion Nanoparticles for Emerging NIR Optoelectronic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The special photo&#8208;responsiveness of upconversion nanoparticles has opened up a new path for the advancement of near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;responsive optoelectronics. However, challenges such as low energy&#8208;conversion efficiency and high nonradiative losses still persist. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the relationship between materials properties and device performance, offering both theoretical and empirical guidance for the development of high&#8208;performance NIR optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
Upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs), incorporating lanthanide (Ln) dopants, can convert low&#8208;energy near&#8208;infrared photons into higher&#8208;energy visible or ultraviolet light through nonlinear energy transfer processes. This distinctive feature has attracted considerable attention in both fundamental research and advanced optoelectronics. Challenges such as low energy&#8208;conversion efficiency and nonradiative losses limit the performance of UCNP&#8208;based optoelectronic devices. Recent advancements including optimized core&#8211;shell structures, tailed Ln&#8208;doping concentration, and surface modifications show significant promise for improving the efficiency and stability. In addition, combining UCNPs with functional materials can broaden their applications and improve device performance, paving the way for the innovation of next&#8208;generation optoelectronics. This paper first categorizes and elaborates on various upconversion mechanisms in UCNPs, focusing on strategies to boost energy transfer efficiency and prolong luminescence. Subsequently, an in&#8208;depth discussion of the various materials that can enhance the efficiency of UCNPs and expand their functionality is provided. Furthermore, a wide range of UCNP&#8208;based optoelectronic devices is explored, and multiple emerging applications in UCNP&#8208;based neuromorphic computing are highlighted. Finally, the existing challenges and potential solutions involved in developing practical UCNPs optoelectronic devices are considered, as well as an outlook on the future of UCNPs in advanced technologies is provided.

         <title>Advancements in Carbon&#8208;Based Piezoelectric Materials: Mechanism, Classification, and Applications in Energy Science</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon&#8208;based piezoelectric materials are systematically categorized based on their structural and functional properties. The mechanisms of stress&#8208;induced charge transfer are elucidated, and their applications are explored across three key domains: piezoelectric catalysis for energy conversion and environmental remediation, piezoelectric biomedical treatments for tissue regeneration and antitumor therapies, and piezoelectric generators and sensors for energy harvesting and advanced sensing technologies.








Abstract
The piezoelectric phenomenon has garnered considerable interest due to its distinctive physical properties associated with the materials involved. Piezoelectric materials, which are inherently non&#8208;centrosymmetric, can generate an internal electric field under mechanical stress, enhancing carrier separation and transfer due to electric dipole moments. While inorganic piezoelectric materials are often investigated for their high piezoelectric coefficients, they come with potential drawbacks such as toxicity and high production cost, which hinder their practical applications. Consequently, carbon&#8208;based piezoelectric materials have emerged as an alternative to inorganic materials, boasting advantages such as a large specific surface area, high conductivity, flexibility, and eco&#8208;friendliness. Research into the applications of carbon&#8208;based piezoelectric materials spans environmental remediation, energy conversion, and biomedical treatments, indicating a promising future. This review marks the first comprehensive attempt to discuss and summarize the various types of carbon&#8208;based piezoelectric materials. It delves into the underlying mechanisms by which piezoelectricity influences catalysis, biomedical applications, nanogenerators, and sensors. Additionally, various potential techniques are presented to enhance the piezoelectric performance. The design principles of representative fabrication strategies for carbon&#8208;based piezoelectric materials are analyzed, emphasizing their current limitations and potential improvements for future development. It is believed that recent advances in carbon&#8208;based piezoelectric materials will make a significant impact.

         <dc:description>
Strategies achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries are summarized and analyzed from both their separate advancements and the integrated effectiveness in this review. Then, perspectives are given for valuable guidance for further development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are emerging as a promising energy storage technique supplementary to Li&#8208;ion batteries, attracting much research attention owing to their intrinsic safety, cost economy, and environmental friendliness. However, energy densities for AZIBs still do not fulfill practical requirements because of the low specific and areal capacity, limited working potential, and excessive negative&#8208;to&#8208;positive electrode capacity (N/P) ratio. In this review, a comprehensive overview of basic requirements and major challenges for achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density AZIBs is provided. Following that, recent progress in the optimization of each component and the overall configuration is summarized, and crucial design principles are discussed. Apart from conventional emphasis on each part, especially cathode materials, separately, the comprehensive discussion about the synergistic interactions among all components is conducted. Finally, the outlook and research direction are given to provide valuable guidance for the further holistic development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Harnessing Synergistic Cooperation of Neighboring Active Motifs in Heterogeneous Catalysts for Enhanced Catalytic Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review examines the critical role of neighboring active motifs in heterogeneous catalysts, emphasizing how their synergistic cooperativity can be rationally designed to modulate catalytic properties. The discussion centers on the modulation of electronic and geometric structures, categorizing the catalytic systems into metal&#8208;acid (Br&#248;nsted/Lewis) pairs, metal&#8208;base pairs, and metal&#8208;metal pairs. The goal is to provide a systematic overview that offers insights into the design and characterization of next&#8208;generation multifunctional catalysts.








Abstract
Understanding the intricate interplay between catalytically active motifs in heterogeneous catalysts has long posed a significant challenge in the design of highly active and selective reactions. Drawing inspiration from biological enzymes and homogeneous catalysts, the synergistic cooperation between neighboring active motifs has emerged as a crucial factor in achieving effective catalysis. This synergistic control is often observed in natural enzymes and homogeneous systems through ligand coordination. The synergistic interaction is especially vital in reactions involving tandem or cascade steps, where distinct active motifs provide different functionalities to enable the co&#8208;activation of the reaction substrate(s). Situated within a 3D spatial domain, these catalytically active motifs can shape favorable catalytic landscapes by modulating electronic and geometric characteristics, thereby stabilizing specific intermediate or transition state species in a specific catalytic reaction. In this review, we aim to explore a diverse array of the latest heterogeneous catalytic systems that capitalize on the synergistic cooperativity between neighboring active motifs. We will delve into how such synergistic interactions can be utilized to engineer more favorable catalytic landscapes, ultimately resulting in the modulation of catalytic reactivities.

&lt;p&gt;Understanding the intricate interplay between catalytically active motifs in heterogeneous catalysts has long posed a significant challenge in the design of highly active and selective reactions. Drawing inspiration from biological enzymes and homogeneous catalysts, the synergistic cooperation between neighboring active motifs has emerged as a crucial factor in achieving effective catalysis. This synergistic control is often observed in natural enzymes and homogeneous systems through ligand coordination. The synergistic interaction is especially vital in reactions involving tandem or cascade steps, where distinct active motifs provide different functionalities to enable the co-activation of the reaction substrate(s). Situated within a 3D spatial domain, these catalytically active motifs can shape favorable catalytic landscapes by modulating electronic and geometric characteristics, thereby stabilizing specific intermediate or transition state species in a specific catalytic reaction. In this review, we aim to explore a diverse array of the latest heterogeneous catalytic systems that capitalize on the synergistic cooperativity between neighboring active motifs. We will delve into how such synergistic interactions can be utilized to engineer more favorable catalytic landscapes, ultimately resulting in the modulation of catalytic reactivities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bioinspired Design of Heterogenous Single&#8208;Atomic&#8208;Site Catalysts for Electrocatalysis and Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review gives a summary on the representative bioinspired single&#8208;atomic&#8208;site catalysts (SACs) and their applications in heterogeneous electrocatalysis and photocatalysis. The fundamentals of bioinspired design strategies are systematically discussed in the context of the first shell coordination, the second/long&#8208;range coordination, and the outer microenvironment. The applications of SACs in electrocatalysis and photocatalysis as inspired by natural enzymes are discussed.








Abstract
The emergence of single&#8208;atomic&#8208;site catalysts (SACs) provides a specific model to bridge the gap between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. An interesting aspect in SACs is how to apply the bioinspired strategies in homogeneous biocatalysis to the design of heterogeneous SACs. The effectiveness of this approach relies on systematic insights in structural characteristics and catalytic mechanisms of both the biocatalysts and the heterogeneous SACs. This review will give a summary on the representative bioinspired single&#8208;atomic&#8208;site catalysts and their applications in heterogeneous electrocatalysis and photocatalysis. The fundamentals of bioinspired design strategies will be systematically discussed in the first shell coordination (quasi&#8208;homogeneous metal centers and coordination numbers/species) and the second/long&#8208;range coordination (heteroatoms doping, dual&#8208;metallic sites, nano&#8208;single&#8208;atom&#8208;site, and metal&#8208;support interaction). Also, the unique non&#8208;covalent interactions and oriented mass/proton/electron transfer channels in heterogenous SACs are highlighted as inspired by the outer microenvironment of biological systems. The practical electrocatalytic and photocatalytic applications of bioinspired SACs are further discussed by drawing inspiration from hydrogenase, nitrogenase, oxidase, and dehydrogenase to produce hydrogen&#8208;, carbon&#8208;, nitrogen&#8208;, and oxygen&#8208;based value&#8208;added chemicals. The current challenges and future opportunities for the development of bioinspired heterogenous SACs will also be discussed.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protonic ceramic electrolysis cells (PCECs) are a promising intermediate&#8208;temperature hydrogen production technology, leveraging high proton conductivity in electrolytes yet constrained by insufficient catalytic activity and interfacial instability in fuel/air electrodes. This review systematically categorizes advanced electrode materials and critically evaluates optimization strategies, including doping, interface engineering, and microstructure control, to enhance their catalytic activity and durability.








Abstract
Protonic ceramic electrolysis cells (PCECs) exhibit superior proton conductivity under intermediate&#8208;temperature operation (300&#8211;600&#160;&#176;C), emerging as a promising water electrolysis technology compared to traditional low&#8208;temperature proton&#8208;conducting polymer electrolysis and high&#8208;temperature oxygen ion&#8208;conducting oxide electrolysis. However, the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and electrode instability in PCECs hinder their large&#8208;scale development. This review highlights recent advancements in PCEC technology, emphasizing its thermodynamic and kinetic advantages, the categorization of advanced electrode materials, and material regulation strategies, including chemical doping, microstructural engineering, and multiphase design to improve their catalytic performance and stability. Additionally, the current challenges are discussed and future research directions are outlined for advanced PCEC electrode materials. By summarizing recent advancements in electrode materials and their optimization strategies, this review provides valuable insights into the rational design of efficient and stable electrode materials, advancing PCEC technology for green hydrogen production.

&lt;p&gt;Solar energy is the most promising and ultimate renewable energy resource, and silicon photovoltaic technology has gone through exciting growth globally. Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) provide solar energy solutions for application scenarios different from existing PV technologies. The organic PV technology, with the synergetic progress in the past decades, has now reached 20% power conversion efficiency (PCE), which has the potential to empower serious new applications using the unique features of OPV&#8212;light weight, colorful, semitransparent, flexibility, etc. The concise review focuses on recent device engineering progress in OPV technologies. The background of OPV devices and materials, especially recent nonfullerene acceptors, will first be presented; then, in the recent device engineering progress, the focus will be on active layer engineering to control the morphology of OPV, leading to recent 19%&#8211;20% efficiency. The parallel progress in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) and sequential layer-by-layer approaches will be summarized. The transparent OPV (TOPV) devices are of great interest with unique features and provide the broadest design space among all solar technologies. This work reviews the TOPV progress covering the active layer and transparent optical structure designs. The future research directions in OPV are discussed with perspective.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Progress and Prospect for Conducting Polymer Fibers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, conducting polymer fibers (CPFs) are examined along five lines: classification based on raw materials, dispersion behaviors, fabrication methods, multilevel structure&#8208;performance correlations, and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art applications as flexible and wearable electronics. A deep discussion on the dependence of overall performance on the multilevel structure is presented. Finally, existing challenges, possible solutions, and potential applications of CPFs are discussed.








Abstract
The integration of plastic&#8208;like mechanical flexibility and metal&#8208;level electrical conductivity makes conducting polymer fibers (CPFs) find extensive uses, covering from lightweight conductors to wearable devices. Preceding conventional conductors, the additional combination of unique electrochemical activity and biocompatibility guides CPF to promise a new era of fibrous and textile electronics. Intriguing performance of CPFs roots in the intrinsic properties of conducting polymers, but is also highly related to the multilevel structures of chain aggregates. This fundamental structure&#8208;performance relationship deserves a deep discussion to understand the dramatically increasing achievements in both research and products. Herein, the latest research on CPFs is reviewed to introduce their classification, fabrication methods, and performance. Then, the structure&#8208;performance correlations of reported CPFs are presented to understand the dependence of overall properties on multilevel structures. Further, recent developments regarding the microstructural control and performance optimization of CPFs are discussed as well as their frontier applications in wearable systems, energy converters, and biological probes. Finally, existing challenges, possible solutions, and potential applications of CPFs are prospected. This review can provide helpful guidance for manufacturing ideally structured high&#8208;performance CPFs for advanced flexible electronics.

         <title>Plaque&#8208;Targeted Delivery of Fluoride&#8208;Free MXene Nanozyme for Alleviating Atherosclerosis via Sonocatalytic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work has developed a dual enzyme&#8208;mimicking and ultrasound&#8208;responsive Nb2C&#8208;Pt@HA&#8208;PEG nanozyme. ROS&#8208;eliminating and anti&#173;inflammatory capability of Nb2C&#8208;Pt@HA&#8208;PEG under US irradiation are demonstrated on macrophages and endothelial cells in vitro. Nb2C&#8208;Pt@HA&#8208;PEG&#8208;mediated sonocatalytic therapy exerts an outstanding anti&#8208;atherosclerosis efficacy by regulating intraplaque redox homeostasis, contributing to lesional shrinkage and a more stable plaque phenotype in plaque&#8208;bearing mice.








Abstract
Atherosclerosis is an oxidative stress&#8208;induced chronic inflammatory condition underpinning the progression of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), ultimately resulting in leading mortality rate globally. Ultrasound (US)&#8208;triggered catalysis offers localized treatment for deep&#8208;seated plaques effectively and safely, with demand for targeted delivery and anti&#8208;inflammatory properties of sonosensitizers. 2D MXene&#8208;based nanomedicine is garnering attention because of their intriguing catalytic properties of scavenging excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS), yet MXene&#8208;assisted sonocatalytic therapy (SCT) for treating CVDs remains scarce. Here, this study reports a dual enzyme&#8208;mimicking and US&#8208;responsive MXene termed Nb2C&#8208;Pt@HA&#8208;PEG for alleviating atherosclerosis. US irradiation enhances the capability of Nb2C&#8208;Pt@HA&#8208;PEG nanozymes in eliminating broad&#8208;spectrum ROS and resolving vascular inflammation. Besides, actively targeting lesional macrophages improves their systemic delivery to plaque and further boosts anti&#8208;atherosclerotic efficacy, contributing to &#8776;30% plaque size reduction and a more stabilized plaque phenotype. Notably, etching without hydrofluoric acid renders this nanozyme highly biocompatible. In long&#8208;term biosafety studies, Nb2C&#8208;Pt@HA&#8208;PEG is pronouncedly cleared from major organs and no severe changes of liver and kidney functions are observed. Consequently, this work demonstrates that Nb2C&#8208;Pt@HA&#8208;PEG&#8208;mediated SCT effectively ameliorates advanced atherosclerosis without inducing severe cytotoxicity, offering promising translational potential of MXene&#8208;based nanomedicine. Besides, it broadens application prospects of MXenes to the biomedical field of treating CVDs.

         <title>Active Fabric Origami Enabled by Digital Embroidery of Magnetic Yarns</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates a scalable textile manufacturing process that fabricates active origami fabrics (AFO) via digital embroidery of magnetic yarns. The programmable AFO exhibits reversible 2D and 3D transformations under magnetic fields, enabling functionalities such as altering surface roughness and linear actuation. These reversible deformation fabrics show promising potential for diverse applications in smart textiles and wearable devices.








Abstract
Active fabrics can perform deformations such as contraction, expansion, and bending when exposed to external stimuli. Origami, the ancient art of paper folding, transforms a 2D sheet into a complex 3D structure. However, integrating origami&#8208;inspired designs into active fabrics presents significant challenges, including the large&#8208;scale production of stimuli&#8208;responsive yarns that can be processed using standard textile techniques to achieve intricate origami patterns with high precision and versatility. In this work, the large&#8208;scale fabrication of magnetic yarns featuring high magnetic susceptibility, mechanical strength, and flexibility is reported, which is enabled by processing magnetic polymer composites with a series of textile engineering processes. Utilizing digital embroidery, these magnetic yarns are programmed into origami patterns with predefined yarn alignments on flexible fabrics to create various active fabric origami structures that are mechanical durable and functional consistent. These structures can reversibly transform among shapes in response to specific magnetic fields, enabling a range of functionalities such as altering surface roughness, delivering linear actuation, mimicking flower blooming, and providing switchable thermal insulation. The novel active fabric origami provides promising smart platforms across areas as diverse as smart textiles, soft robotics, wearable devices, and fashion.

         <title>Ultrastable Calcium Metal Anodes Enabled by a Strongly Coordinated Electrolyte Derived Bilayer Solid Electrolyte Interphase</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploring reliable electrolytes and constructing favorable SEI structure are pivotal for advancing calcium metal batteries. A strongly solvated and alkaxyborate anion mediated electrolyte demonstrates ultra&#8208;stable Ca metal anodes for over 1450&#160;h. This electrolyte derives an organic (outer)&#8208;inorganic (inner) bi&#8208;layered SEI that facilitates Ca ion migration for Ca metal plating/stripping reactions.








Abstract
Calcium (Ca) metal battery is a promising alternative to current lithium battery chemistry due to the high crustal abundance of Ca element and potentially dendrite&#8208;free cycling of high&#8208;capacity Ca metal anodes. However, reversible Ca metal stripping and plating have been hindered by the lack of effective electrolytes and the formation of obstructive solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers. Here a strongly coordinated electrolyte system by incorporating LiB(hfip)4 into Ca[B(hfip)4]2/glyme solutions is introduced. The highly coordinated glyme molecules and B(hfip)4&#8722; anions are ready to decompose into organic rich compounds and CaH2, CaB2O4 nanocrystals in the SEI layers on Ca metal surface. Transmission electron microscopy observations reveal that these ionically conductive inorganic particles are embedded beneath the organic&#8208;rich outer layer, thus forming a bilayer SEI configuration. This unique structure facilitates efficient Ca&#8208;ion transfer while preventing further electrolyte decomposition. Effectiveness of this electrolyte is evidenced by the ultrastable Ca//Ca symmetrical cells (over 1450&#160;h with low potentials of &lt;0.5&#160;V vs. Ca/Ca2+ at a high current density of 2&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2) and the high&#8208;energy Ca//polyaniline full cells (energy densities of above 200&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 over 200 cycles), which set new benchmarks in the field of room&#8208;temperature Ca metal batteries.

&lt;p&gt;Exploring reliable electrolytes and constructing favorable SEI structure are pivotal for advancing calcium metal batteries. A strongly solvated and alkaxyborate anion mediated electrolyte demonstrates ultra-stable Ca metal anodes for over 1450&#160;h. This electrolyte derives an organic (outer)-inorganic (inner) bi-layered SEI that facilitates Ca ion migration for Ca metal plating/stripping reactions.

         <title>Upper Layer&#8208;Modulated Pseudo Planar Heterojunction with Metal Complex Acceptor for Efficient and Stable Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal complex acceptor (MCA), PtAC&#8208;Cl, is synthesized and incorporated into the upper host acceptor layer of PM6/Y6 to regulate morphology and fill trap states. A high PCE of 18.16% in PM6/Y6:PtAC&#8208;Cl devices is achieved with a T80 lifetime of &#8776;401 h under continuous illumination at MPP tracking and 1265 h under continuous heating at 70&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Modulating self&#8208;aggregation and charge transport in the upper acceptor layer of the pseudo planar heterojunction (PPHJ) is crucial for enhancing dielectric constant and suppressing trap density, leading to efficient and stable organic photovoltaics (OPVs). In this work, a metal complex acceptor (MCA), PtAC&#8208;Cl, is selectively incorporated into the upper host Y6 layer of PPHJ to regulate morphology and fill trap states. There exists a strong chemical interaction between PtAC&#8208;Cl and Y6, which can promote electron transfer. PtAC&#8208;Cl can regulate the self&#8208;aggregation and extend the exciton diffusion length of Y6, resulting in enhanced charge transport and reduced energetic disorder. Consequently, upper layer&#8208;modulated PPHJ devices with PtAC&#8208;Cl achieved a significant power conversion efficiency of 18.16%. The universality of PtAC&#8208;Cl is also demonstrated in PM6/eC9 and PM6/L8&#8208;BO systems, achieving the highest PCEs of 18.79 and 19.30%, respectively. All the improved PCEs are mainly attributed to the enhanced fill factor (FF) and short circuit current (Jsc) compared with the controls. Additionally, PtAC&#8208;Cl significantly improves the thermal stability and photostability of the devices, with a T80 lifetime of &#8776; 401 h under continuous illumination with simulated 1&#8208;Sun light and 1265 h under continuous heating at 70&#160;&#176;C. Overall, this work introduces the concept of MCA and proposes a practical and efficient method to enhance the efficiency and stability of OPVs through selective upper&#8208;layer modulation in PPHJ with MCA.

         <title>Cottonseed&#8208;Derived Reusable Bio&#8208;Carbon Gel Ink for DIW Printing Soft Electronic Textiles</title>

         <dc:description>
A reusable carbon&#8208;gel ink, incorporating cottonseed peptone as a natural mediator, enables cross&#8208;linked ionic polymer networks for advanced conductivity, stability, and biocompatibility. Compatible with direct&#8208;ink&#8208;writing, it facilitates flexible electronics on polymeric and textile substrates for multifunctional applications, including motion sensing, energy harvesting, and self&#8208;powered pressure detection. Integrated smart e&#8208;textile systems have demonstrated human&#8208;machine interaction for signal translation and robotic manipulation.








Abstract
Soft electronics textiles have garnered global attention for their wearability and promising applications in healthcare, energy devices, and artificial intelligence. Recently, direct&#8208;ink&#8208;writing (DIW) technology has shown a growing trend because of its controllability, ease of fabrication, and efficiency. However, the design novelty of printable ink for soft electronic textiles is severely hampered by the intrinsic challenges of integrating printability, conductivity, stretchability, biocompatibility, and durability. Herein, a reusable DIW bio&#8208;carbon gel ink is proposed for printing soft electronic textiles where cottonseed peptone&#8208;functionalized multi&#8208;wall carbon nanotubes (CPCNTs) exhibit high dispersibility and reactive surface groups, enabling stable cross&#8208;linking with phytic acid (PA) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) to form a strong ionic polymer composite. Encouragingly, the gel ink can be directly exploited to design complex circuits and versatile electronics via DIW printing on both polymeric and textile substrates. The viscoelasticity, mechanical recovery, electric properties, robustness, and stretchable architectures enable it to function as flexible circuits, smart sensors, and renewable generators. As demonstrations, multifunctional applications are presented by real&#8208;time healthcare monitoring, LED lighting, and power generation. Furthermore, this printable gel ink is effectively assembled into an integrated wearable unit for robot manipulation and real&#8208;time gesture recognition, suggesting a significant printing strategy for next&#8208;generation wearable electronics.

         <title>Efficient Low&#8208;temperature Ammonia Cracking Enabled by Strained Heterostructure Interfaces on Ru&#8208;free Catalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Leveraging the strong metal&#8208;support interaction effect, heterostructured interfaces in a Co&#8208;based catalyst are designed to enable low&#8208;temperature ammonia (NH3) decomposition. The induced tensile lattice strain within the core&#8208;shell structure modulates d&#8208;band center of Co, enhancing NH3 adsorption and facilitating N&#9472;H bond dissociation. Furthermore, the dynamic lattice strain release and restoration mechanism promotes NH3 dehydrogenation and by&#8208;product desorption, effectively optimizing the reaction pathway and ensuring sustained catalytic activity.








Abstract
Ammonia (NH3) has emerged as a promising liquid carrier for hydrogen (H2) storage. However, its widespread adoption in H2 technology is impeded by the reliance on costly Ru catalysts for low&#8208;temperature NH3 cracking reaction. Here, a strained heterostructure Co@BaAl2O4&#8722;x core@shell catalyst is reported that demonstrates catalytic performance at low reaction temperatures comparable to most Ru&#8208;based catalysts. This catalyst exhibits exceptional activity across a range of space velocity conditions, maintaining high conversion rates at 475 to 575&#160;&#176;C and achieving an impressive H2 production rate of 64.6&#160;mmol H2 gcat&#8722;1&#160;min&#8722;1. Synchrotron X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction, and kinetic studies are carried out to elucidate the dynamic changes of the strained heterostructure interface of Co&#8208;core and BaAl2O4&#8722;x&#8208;overlayer under catalytic working conditions. The performance enhancement mechanisms are attributed to the tensile strained Co surface encapsulated in the defective BaAl2O4&#8722;x, which enhances NH3 adsorption and facilitates the rate&#8208;determining N&#9472;H dissociation. Furthermore, the strain release and restoration during NH3 dehydrogenation enable efficient nitrogen desorption, preventing active site poisoning. This work highlights the effectiveness of lattice strain engineering and the development of synergistic strong metal&#8208;support interfaces between active metal nanoparticles and oxide support to boost low&#8208;temperature NH3 cracking.

         <title>Interface Reinforced Tailoring of Quantum Dots Regulates Reaction Trajectory of CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interface&#8208;reinforced regulation strategy is proposed to tailor the activation mode of CO2 in water. The facilitation of directional electron transfer and the interface&#8208;reinforced charge difference of the catalytic site at the CdSe/S/InS QD interface greatly promotes the shift of reaction trajectory of CO2 photoreduction, i.e., the main HCOO&#8722; product for CdSe is transformed into CO for CdSe/S/InS QDs.








Abstract
Artificial photosynthesis using semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) is one of the most promising pathways toward converting CO2 into valuable chemicals. However, the multistep process of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion endows the regulation of reaction trajectory from CO2 to specific products very challenging in aqueous solution. Here, it is first disclosed that the anisotropic growth of CdSe&#8722;S&#8722;InS interface in ultrafine heterojunction QDs alters the trajectory of CO2 photoreduction in water, i.e., CdSe/S/InS QDs mainly produce CO while CdSe QDs generate HCOO&#8722;. Under optimal conditions, the CO turnover number of CdSe/S/InS QDs is &#8776;1000 (12 h; vs QDs) with a selectivity of &gt;96% in C&#8208;based products or &#8776;57.6% when considering H2. The formation of anisotropic CdSe/S/InS ultrafine heterojunction facilitates charge migration at the interface, which is confirmed by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and transient absorption spectroscopy. Further DFT simulations and in situ experiments demonstrate that the interfacial lattice expansion reinforces the charge difference at the interface, thus contributing to the product shift from HCOOH to CO, which clarifies the mechanism of interface&#8208;reinforced tailoring of CO2 reaction trajectories. This work can not only provide guidance for interfacial CO2 activation mode in water but also inspire the design of novel artificial photocatalysts with new functions.

         <title>Green, Safe, Durable, Printed Fabric Hygroelectric Generators for Wearable Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work achieves a green hygroelectric generator with enhanced electric outputs. All chemicals and materials used in the hygroelectric generators are safe for human and environmentally friendly. The device achieves an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.2 V and a short&#8208;circuit current of 1.0 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2 at room humidity of 55% through the synergistic effect of ion migration and water absorption.








Abstract
Hygroelectric generators, converting energy from moisture into electricity, have attracted great interest due to sustainable and ubiquitous moisture in the environment. However, it is absolutely necessary to replace the fragile and noxious materials reported previously in the hygroelectric generators before real applications for wearables. Herein, a green hygroelectric generator with a high current density is designed for the first time by printing functional materials that are abundant, safe to humans and environments. By engineering printable hydrogel through the synergistic effect of water absorption and ion migration on the fabric, the wearable fabric hygroelectric generators deliver a high open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.2&#160;V with a remarkable short&#8208;circuit current density of 1.0 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2, more than 7 times that of most reported hygroelectric generators. The devices show no performance declination after long&#8208;term storage and bending tests due to the design of stable hydrogel and robust electrode/hydrogel interfaces. Moreover, the devices with cross&#8208;finger structures achieve a facile scalable integration for enhanced electric outputs. Exemplifying applications illustrate the great potential of the printed fabric hygroelectric generators as a direct current power supply for wearable applications. This work sheds light on a novel avenue to design safe and environmentally friendly energy harvesting devices for practical applications.

         <title>Janus Cellular Design Drives Solar&#8208;Powered Spatial Lithium Extraction and Water Co&#8208;Generation from Salt&#8208;Lake Brines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D&#8208;printed Janus cellular solar platform integrates photothermal evaporation, ion&#8208;diffusion&#8208;guided lithium enrichment, and flipping&#8208;induced salt removal. The asymmetric lattice, fabricated via high&#8208;resolution printing and functionalized with porous adsorbents, enables simultaneous water harvesting and selective lithium extraction from hypersaline brines, offering a scalable and energy&#8208;efficient route for sustainable resource recovery.








Abstract
Lithium plays a vital role in energy storage technologies, with global demand rapidly increasing. Current adsorption&#8208;based direct lithium extraction from salt&#8208;lake brines holds promise but suffers from low ion extraction efficiency due to sluggish intercalation kinetics and poor selectivity, necessitating repeated cycles that increase water and energy consumption. Here, a Janus cellular&#8208;structured solar&#8208;powered platform (JCSP) is developed for energy&#8208;efficient lithium extraction and sustainable water harvesting. The cellular platform features a symmetrical, multi&#8208;branched cantilever geometry with distinct upper and lower lattice architectures, where the lower lattice is functionalized with titanium&#8208;based porous adsorbents. This rational lattice design and functionalized adsorption interfaces enhance light absorption, sustain evaporative flow, and create an ion diffusion gradient for selective lithium extraction. Its cantilever configuration enables a self&#8208;flipping mechanism, preventing salt crystallization and ensuring long&#8208;term stability in high&#8208;salinity environments. This design boosts water evaporation efficiency to 3.85&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1, increases lithium adsorption capacity to 43.5&#160;mg g&#8722;1, and enhances Li+/Na+ and Li+/Mg2+ selectivity to 112 and 268, respectively, when treating multi&#8208;ionic hypersaline environment (20 wt% total dissolved salt). The JCSP system demonstrates stable long&#8208;term performance in water evaporation and lithium recovery under extreme conditions, providing a sustainable solution to global water scarcity and rising lithium demand.

         <title>Advancing Self&#8208;Assembled Molecules Toward Interface&#8208;Optimized Perovskite Solar Cells: from One to Two</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the past few years, self&#8208;assembled molecules (SAMs) have ushered in a new era of interface engineering for perovskite solar cells. Herein, the recent progresses of co&#8208;SAM, namely two SAMs with synergy, are comprehensively summarized and analyzed, focusing on topics including deposition methods and design principles, while further challenges about mechanisms, materials, and applications are also outlined.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have rapidly gained prominence as a leading candidate in the realm of solution&#8208;processable third&#8208;generation photovoltaic (PV) technologies. In the high&#8208;efficiency inverted PSCs, self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) are often used as hole&#8208;selective layers (HSLs) due to&#160;the advantages of high transmittance, energy level matching, low non&#8208;radiative recombination loss, and tunable surface properties. However, SAMs have been recognized to suffer from some shortcomings, such as incomplete coverage, weak bonding with substrate or perovskite, instability, and so on. The combination of different SAMs or so&#8208;called co&#8208;SAM is an effective strategy to overcome this challenge. In this Perspective, the latest achievements in molecule design, deposition method, working principle, and application of the co&#8208;SAM are discussed. This comprehensive overview of milestones in this rapidly advancing research field, coupled with an in&#8208;depth analysis of the improved interface properties using the co&#8208;SAM approach, aims to offer valuable insights into the key design principles. Furthermore, the lessons learned will guide the future development of SAM&#8208;based HSLs in perovskite&#8208;based optoelectronic devices.
