         <title>Multifunctional Hyphae Carbon Powering Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biological self&#8208;assembly technology to fabricate Rhizopus hyphae carbon fibre (RHCF) and its derivatives is proposed. The RHCFs are multifunctional as the hosts to combine with metal oxide (CoO) and S, Li metal, and a polypropylene (PP) separator to form an RHCF&#8208;based cathode, anode, and separator, respectively. The as&#8208;assembled RHCF&#8208;based full cell shows excellent cycling capacity and high&#8208;rate performance.








Abstract
Biotechnology can bring new breakthroughs on design and fabrication of energy materials and devices. In this work, a novel and facile biological self&#8208;assembly technology to fabricate multifunctional Rhizopus hyphae carbon fiber (RHCF) and its derivatives on a large scale for electrochemical energy storage is proposed. Crosslinked hollow carbon fibers are successfully prepared by conversion of Rhizopus hyphae, and macroscopic production of centimeter&#8208;level carbon balls consisting of hollow RHCFs is further realized. Moreover, the self&#8208;assembled RHCF balls show strong adsorption characteristics on metal ions and can be converted into a series of derivatives such as RHCF/metal oxides. Notably, the designed RHCF derivatives are demonstrated with powerful multifunctionability as cathode, anode, and separator for lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs). The RHCF can act as the host material to combine with metal oxide (CoO) and S, Li metal, and a polypropylene (PP) separator to form a new RHCF/CoO&#8208;S cathode, an RHCF/Li anode, and an RHCF/PP separator, respectively. Consequently, the optimized LSB full cell presents excellent cycling performance and superior high&#8208;rate capacity (881.3&#160;mA h g&#8211;1 at 1 C). This work provides a new method for large&#8208;scale preparation of hollow carbon fibers and derivatives for advanced energy storage and conversion.

         <title>Sequential Activation of Molecular and Macroscopic Spin&#8208;State Switching within the Hysteretic Region Following Pulsed Light Excitation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taking advantage of an exceptionally reversible bidirectional switching in a molecular spin&#8208;crossover crystal, pump&#8211;probe optical microscopy is used to explore the dynamics of the spin&#8208;state switching within the hysteretic region. Remarkably, before the millisecond timescale, the response of the crystal to the laser excitation involves a gradual and homogeneous molecular conversion process, as if there were&#160;no hysteresis loop.








Abstract
Molecular spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) compounds constitute a promising class of photoactive materials exhibiting efficient photoinduced phase transitions (PIPTs). Taking advantage of the unique, picture&#8208;perfect reproducibility of the spin&#8208;transition properties in the compound [Fe(HB(1,2,4&#8208;triazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)3)2], the spatiotemporal dynamics of the PIPT within the thermodynamic metastability (hysteretic) region of a single crystal is dissected, using pump&#8211;probe optical microscopy. Beyond a threshold laser&#8208;excitation density, complete PIPTs are evidenced, with conversion rates up to 200 switched molecules per absorbed photon. It is shown that the PIPT takes place through the sequential activation of two (molecular and macroscopic) switching mechanisms, occurring on sub&#8208;microsecond and millisecond timescales, governed by the intramolecular and free energy barriers of the system, respectively. The main finding here is that the thermodynamic metastability has strictly no influence on the sub&#8208;millisecond switching dynamics. Indeed, before this millisecond timescale, the response of the crystal to the laser excitation involves a gradual, molecular conversion process, as if there were&#160;no hysteresis loop. Consequently, in this regime, even a 100% photoinduced conversion may not give rise to a PIPT. These results provide new insight on the intrinsic dynamical limits of the PIPT, which is an important issue from a technological perspective.

         <title>Homologous Bromides Treatment for Improving the Open&#8208;Circuit Voltage of Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite surface treatment by homologous bromide salts is investigated. It is found that bromides not only passivate surface defects but also penetrate into the perovskite providing bulk passivation. This leads to a large voltage&#160;of 1.24 V&#160;in a 1.63&#160;eV bandgap device and an efficiency of 23.7%&#160;in a 1.56&#160;eV bandgap device.








Abstract
The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of solution&#8208;processed organic&#8211;inorganic mixed halide perovskite solar cells has achieved rapid improvement. However, it is imperative to minimize the voltage deficit (Woc&#160;= Eg/q&#160;&#8722; Voc) for their PCE to approach the theoretical limit. Herein, the strategy of depositing homologous bromide salts on the perovskite surface to achieve a surface and bulk passivation for the fabrication of solar cells with high open&#8208;circuit voltage is reported. Distinct from the conclusions given by previous works, that homologous bromides such as FABr only react with PbI2 to form a large&#8208;bandgap perovskite layer on top of the original perovskite, this work shows that the bromide also penetrates the perovskite film and passivates the perovskite in the bulk. This is confirmed by the small&#8208;bandgap enlargement observed by absorbance and photoluminescence, and the bromide element ratio increasing in the bulk by time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry and depth&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Furthermore, a clear suppression of non&#8208;radiative recombination is confirmed by a variety of characterization methods. This work provides a simple and universal way to reduce the Woc of single&#8208;junction perovskite solar cells and it will also shed light on developing other high&#8208;performance optoelectronic devices, including perovskite&#8208;based tandems and light&#8208;emitting diodes.

         <title>Auxetics&#8208;Inspired Tunable Metamaterials for Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Auxetics refers to structures or materials identified by a negative Poisson's ratio and exhibiting a counterintuitive geometrical behavior. Inspired by auxetics, mechanically tunable magnetic metamaterials in both planar and hemispherical configurations operating at megahertz frequencies are proposed, which serve to enhance local magnetic fields and increase signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (&#8776;4.5&#215;) in their application to magnetic resonance imaging.








Abstract
Auxetics refers to structures or materials with a negative Poisson's ratio, thereby capable of exhibiting counterintuitive behaviors. Herein, auxetic structures are exploited to design mechanically tunable metamaterials in both planar and hemispherical configurations operating at megahertz (MHz) frequencies, optimized for their application to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Specially, the reported tunable metamaterials are composed of arrays of interjointed unit cells featuring metallic helices, enabling auxetic patterns with a negative Poisson's ratio. The deployable deformation of the metamaterials yields an added degree of freedom with respect to frequency tunability through the resultant modification of the electromagnetic interactions between unit cells. The metamaterials are fabricated using 3D printing technology and an &#8776;20&#160;MHz frequency shift of the resonance mode is enabled during deformation. Experimental validation is performed in a clinical (3.0 T) MRI system, demonstrating that the metamaterials enable a marked boost in radiofrequency field strength under resonance&#8208;matched conditions, ultimately yielding a dramatic increase in the signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (&#8776;4.5&#215;) of MRI. The tunable metamaterials presented herein offer a novel pathway toward the practical utilization of metamaterials in MRI, as well as a range of other emerging applications.

         <title>Brain&#8208;Targeted Aggregation&#8208;Induced&#8208;Emission Nanoparticles with Near&#8208;Infrared Imaging at 1550&#160;nm Boosts Orthotopic Glioblastoma Theranostics</title>

         <dc:description>
The near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II)&#8208;imaging&#8208;guided photothermal therapy (PTT) of nanofluorophores is a promising approach for theranostic of orthotopic glioma. Brain&#8208;targeting nanofluorophores featuring novel molecular design of &#8220;backbone distortion + molecular rotor&#8221; are prepared. They can balance the photon energy flow to achieve advanced NIR&#8208;II imaging at 1550&#160;nm and photo&#8208;to&#8208;heat ratio for PTT in orthotopic&#8208;glioma&#8208;bearing mice.








Abstract
A remaining challenge in the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is surmounting the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB). Such a challenge prevents the development of efficient theranostic approaches that combine reliable diagnosis with targeted therapy. In this study, brain&#8208;targeted near&#8208;infrared IIb (NIR&#8208;IIb) aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission (AIE) nanoparticles are developed via rational design, which involves twisting the planar molecular backbone with steric hindrance. The resulting nanoparticles can balance competing responsiveness demands for radiation&#8208;mediated NIR fluorescence imaging at 1550&#160;nm and non&#8208;radiation NIR photothermal therapy (NIR&#8208;PTT). The brain&#8208;targeting peptide apolipoprotein E peptide (ApoE) is grafted onto these nanoparticles (termed as ApoE&#8208;Ph NPs) to target glioma and promote efficient BBB traversal. A long imaging wavelength 1550&#160;nm band&#8208;pass filter is utilized to monitor the in vivo biodistribution and accumulation of the nanoparticles in a model of orthotopic glioma, which overcomes previous limitations in wavelength range and equipment. The results demonstrate that the ApoE&#8208;Ph NPs have a higher PTT efficiency and significantly enhanced survival of mice bearing orthotopic GBM with moderate irradiation (0.5&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2). Collectively, the work highlights the smart design of a brain&#8208;targeted NIR&#8208;II AIE theranostic approach that opens new diagnosis and treatment options in the photonic therapy of GBM.

         <title>Assessing the Photovoltaic Quality of Vacuum&#8208;Thermal Evaporated Organic Semiconductor Blends</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The authors asses state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art vacuum thermal&#8208;evaporated organic solar cells (VTE OSCs) in their photovoltaic material quality. The comprehensive optoelectronic characterization yields four key metrics governing OSC performance&#8212;a new methodology that equally applies to solution&#8208;processed OSCs. The five studied material blends give a representative overview of today's VTE OSCs and needs for improvement are identified for this industrially leading OSC technology.








Abstract
Vacuum&#8208;thermal evaporation (VTE) is a highly relevant fabrication route for organic solar cells (OSCs), especially on an industrial scale as proven by the commercialization of organic light emitting diode&#8208;based displays. While OSC performance is reported for a range of VTE&#8208;deposited molecules, a comprehensive assessment of donor:acceptor blend properties with respect to their photovoltaic performance is scarce. Here, the organic thin films and solar cells of three select systems are fabricated and ellipsometry, external quantum efficiency with high dynamic range, as well as OTRACE are measured to quantify absorption, voltage losses, and charge carrier mobility. These parameters are key to explain OSC performance and will help to rationalize the performance of other material systems reported in literature as the authors&#8217; methodology is applicable beyond VTE systems. Furthermore, it can help to judge the prospects of new molecules in general. The authors find large differences in the measured values and find that today's VTE OSCs can reach high extinction coefficients, but only moderate mobility and voltage loss compared to their solution&#8208;processed counterparts. What needs to be improved for VTE OSCs is outlined to again catch up with their solution&#8208;processed counterparts in terms of power conversion efficiency.

         <title>Polymer Acceptors with Flexible Spacers Afford Efficient and Mechanically Robust All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New polymer acceptors (PAs) are developed by embedding flexible conjugation&#8208;break spacer (FCBS) units into the rigid backbones. The incorporation of FCBS affords effective modulation of the crystallinity and pre&#8208;aggregation of the PA and attains optimal blend morphology. As a result, the all&#8208;polymer solar cells exhibit both a high efficiency of 14.68% and excellent mechanical robustness with a crack onset strain of 21.64%.








Abstract
High efficiency and mechanical robustness are both crucial for the practical applications of all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) in stretchable and wearable electronics. In this regard, a series of new polymer acceptors (PAs) is reported by incorporating a flexible conjugation&#8208;break spacer (FCBS) to achieve highly efficient and mechanically robust all&#8208;PSCs. Incorporation of FCBS affords the effective modulation of the crystallinity and pre&#8208;aggregation of the PAs, and achieves the optimal blend morphology with polymer donor (PD), increasing both the photovoltaic and mechanical properties of all&#8208;PSCs. In particular, an all&#8208;PSC based on PYTS&#8208;0.3 PA incorporated with 30% FCBS and PBDB&#8208;T PD demonstrates a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.68% and excellent mechanical stretchability with a crack onset strain (COS) of 21.64% and toughness of 3.86&#160;MJ m&#8208;3, which is significantly superior to those of devices with the PA without the FCBS (PYTS&#8208;0.0, PCE = 13.01%, and toughness = 2.70&#160;MJ m&#8208;3). To date, this COS is the highest value reported for PSCs with PCEs of over 8% without any insulating additives. These results reveal that the introduction of FCBS into the conjugated backbone is a highly feasible strategy to simultaneously improve the PCE and stretchability of PSCs.

         <title>Molecular Engineering of 2D Nanomaterial Field&#8208;Effect Transistor Sensors: Fundamentals and Translation across the Innovation Spectrum</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D nanomaterials are analyzed fundamentally for their field&#8208;effect transistor (FET) and tunneling FET (TFET) sensor applications. With molecular engineering of specific probes, they hold great potential for intelligent management of water by detecting water contaminants with both high sensitivity and high selectivity. Major challenges and opportunities for designing and fabricating 2D nanomaterial FET/TFET sensors with superior performance are also outlined.








Abstract
Over the last decade, 2D layered nanomaterials have attracted significant attention across the scientific community due to their rich and exotic properties. Various nanoelectronic devices based on these 2D nanomaterials have been explored and demonstrated, including those for environmental applications. Here, the fundamental attributes of 2D layered nanomaterials for field&#8208;effect transistor (FET) sensors and tunneling FET (TFET) sensors, which provide versatile detection of water contaminants such as heavy&#8208;metal ions, bacteria, nutrients, and organic pollutants, are discussed. The major challenges and opportunities are also outlined for designing and fabricating 2D nanomaterial FET/TFET sensors with superior performance. Translation of these FET/TFET sensors from fundamental research to applied technology is illustrated through a case study on graphene&#8208;based real&#8208;time FET water sensors. A second case study centers on large&#8208;scale sensor networks for water&#8208;quality monitoring to enable intelligent drinking water and river&#8208;water systems. Overall, 2D nanomaterial FET sensors have significant potential for enabling a human&#8208;centered intelligent water system that can likely be applied to other precarious water supplies around the globe.

         <title>Decoupling Complex Multi&#8208;Length&#8208;Scale Morphology in Non&#8208;Fullerene Photovoltaics with Nitrogen K&#8208;Edge Resonant Soft X&#8208;ray Scattering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multi&#8208;length&#8208;scale morphology in organic photovoltaics (OPVs) is complex and difficult to analyze. An innovative approach is provided by nitrogen K&#8208;edge resonant soft X&#8208;ray scattering, utilizing the spatial and orientational contrast from the cyano groups in the acceptor materials, chemically determining the phase separation, which decouples the mesoscale complexity for understanding the structure&#8211;property relationship in high&#8208;efficiency OPVs.








Abstract
Complex morphology in organic photovoltaics (OPVs) and other functional soft materials commonly dictates performance. Such complexity in OPVs originates from the mesoscale kinetically trapped non&#8208;equilibrium state, which governs device charge generation and transport. Resonant soft X&#8208;ray scattering (RSoXS) has been revolutionary in the exploration of OPV morphology in the past decade due to its chemical and orientation sensitivity. However, for non&#8208;fullerene OPVs, RSoXS analysis near the carbon K&#8208;edge is challenging, due to the chemical similarity of the materials used in active layers.

&lt;p&gt;The multi-length-scale morphology in organic photovoltaics (OPVs) is complex and difficult to analyze. An innovative approach is provided by nitrogen K-edge resonant soft X-ray scattering, utilizing the spatial and orientational contrast from the cyano groups in the acceptor materials, chemically determining the phase separation, which decouples the mesoscale complexity for understanding the structure&#8211;property relationship in high-efficiency OPVs.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complex morphology in organic photovoltaics (OPVs) and other functional soft materials commonly dictates performance. Such complexity in OPVs originates from the mesoscale kinetically trapped non-equilibrium state, which governs device charge generation and transport. Resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS) has been revolutionary in the exploration of OPV morphology in the past decade due to its chemical and orientation sensitivity. However, for non-fullerene OPVs, RSoXS analysis near the carbon K-edge is challenging, due to the chemical similarity of the materials used in active layers. An innovative approach is provided by nitrogen K-edge RSoXS (NK-RSoXS), utilizing the spatial and orientational contrasts from the cyano groups in the acceptor materials, which allows for determination of phase separation. NK-RSoXS clearly visualizes the combined feature sizes in PM6:Y6 blends from crystallization and liquid&#8211;liquid demixing, while PM6:Y6:Y6-BO ternary blends with reduced phase-separation size and enhanced material crystallization can lead to current amplification in devices. Nitrogen is common in organic semiconductors and other soft materials, and the strong and directional N 1s &#8594; &#960;* resonances make NK-RSoXS a powerful tool to uncover the mesoscale complexity and open opportunities to understand heterogeneous systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lateral Fully Organic P&#8211;N Diodes Created in a Single Donor&#8211;Acceptor Copolymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lateral fully organic P&#8211;N diodes can be created in a single polymer, which exhibits a high rectification ratio &#8776;2100 and a high current density 3.83 A cm&#8722;2. This work opens the opportunities to create P&#8211;N junctions in ways of silicon&#8208;based inorganic semiconductors and promises new opportunities for integrating organic materials for flexible and printable organic devices.








Abstract
P&#8211;N junctions exist in many solid&#8208;state organic devices, such as light&#8208;emitting diodes, solar cells, and thermoelectric devices. Creating P&#8211;N junctions by bulk chemical doping in a single organic material (like silicon doped by boron and phosphorus) may capitalize the vast scientific and technological groundwork established in the inorganic semiconducting field. However, high&#8208;performance single&#8208;organic&#8208;material P&#8211;N junctions are seldom reported, because the diffusion of the dopant counterions often leads to transient rectification properties. Herein, a new type of lateral fully organic diodes created in single donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) copolymer films with only one P&#8208;type dopant is reported. The achieved lateral devices exhibit high current densities of &#8776;3.83 A cm&#8722;2 and a high rectification ratio of &#8776;2100, which are beyond the requirements for high&#8208;frequency identification tags. The P&#8208; to N&#8208;type polarity switching mechanism is proposed after spectroscopic and structural tests. Decent stability of the organic diode is obtained, which is due to the long channel length and low diffusion speed of the large size of dopants. This work opens the opportunities to create P&#8211;N junctions in ways of silicon&#8208;based inorganic semiconductors and promises new opportunities for integrating organic materials for flexible and printable organic devices.

         <title>Macrocycle&#8208;Based Porous Organic Polymers for Separation, Sensing, and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocycles as an emerging class of building blocks are used for porous organic polymers owing to their easy functionalization, unique host&#8211;guest properties, modifiable conformations, and tunable chemistry. Facilitated by these features, macrocycle&#8208;based porous organic polymers have attracted considerable attentions in the construction of advanced porous materials and excelled in adsorptive separation, optical sensing, and heterogeneous catalysis.








Abstract
With the rapid development of materials science, porous organic polymers (POPs) have received remarkable attentions because of their unique properties such as the exceptionally high surface area and flexible molecular design. The ability to incorporate specific functions in a precise manner makes POPs promising platforms for a myriad of applications in molecular adsorption, separation, and catalysis. Therefore, many different types of POPs have been rationally designed and synthesized to expand the scope of advanced materials, endowing them with distinct structures and properties. Recently, supramolecular macrocycles with excellent host&#8211;guest complexation abilities are emerging as powerful crosslinkers for developing novel POPs with hierarchical structures and improved performance, which can be well&#8208;organized at different spatial scales. Macrocycle&#8208;based POPs could have unusual porous, adsorptive, and optical properties when compared to their nonmacrocycle&#8208;incorporated counterparts. This cooperation provides valuable insights for the molecular&#8208;level understanding of skeletal complexity and diversity. Here, the research advances of macrocycle&#8208;based POPs are aptly summarized by showing their syntheses, properties, and applications in terms of separation, sensing, and catalysis. Finally, the current challenging issues in this exciting research field are delineated and a comprehensive outlook is offered for their future directions.

         <dc:description>
This review discusses the preparation, unique capabilities, and advantages of biomimetic micromotors, leveraging the attractive properties of cell membrane&#8208;derived natural biomaterials and the dynamic movement of synthetic micromotors. Such cell membrane&#8208;functional micromotors enable important biomedical operations across a wide range of applications, including drug delivery, decontamination, immunotherapy, and phototherapy.








Abstract
There has been considerable interest in developing synthetic micromotors with biofunctional, versatile, and adaptive capabilities for biomedical applications. In this perspective, cell membrane&#8208;functionalized micromotors emerge as an attractive platform. This new class of micromotors demonstrates enhanced propulsion and compelling performance in complex biological environments, making them suitable for various in vivo applications, including drug delivery, detoxification, immune modulation, and phototherapy. This article reviews various proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept studies based on different micromotor designs and cell membrane coatings in these areas. The review focuses on the motor structure and performance relationship and highlights how cell membrane functionalization overcomes the obstacles faced by traditional synthetic micromotors while imparting them with unique capabilities. Overall, the cell membrane&#8208;functionalized micromotors are expected to advance micromotor research and facilitate its translation towards practical uses.

This review presents a critical assessment of lignocellulosics for engineering optically functional materials for smart devices. It discusses the effects of fibrillation, fibril alignment, densification, self&#8208;assembly, surface&#8208;patterning, and compositing on targeted optical properties, such as transparency, haze, luminescence, UV&#8208;absorption, and structural colors. The scope covers the main plant&#8208;based structural materials, as well as non&#8208;lignocellulosic additives bearing an optical function.








Abstract
This review addresses the reconstruction of structural plant components (cellulose, lignin, and hemicelluloses) into materials displaying advanced optical properties. The strategies to isolate the main building blocks are discussed, and the effects of fibrillation, fibril alignment, densification, self&#8208;assembly, surface&#8208;patterning, and compositing are presented considering their role in engineering optical performance. Then, key elements that enable lignocellulosic to be translated into materials that present optical functionality, such as transparency, haze, reflectance, UV&#8208;blocking, luminescence, and structural colors, are described. Mapping the optical landscape that is accessible from lignocellulosics is shown as an essential step toward their utilization in smart devices. Advanced materials built from sustainable resources, including those obtained from industrial or agricultural side streams, demonstrate enormous promise in optoelectronics due to their potentially lower cost, while meeting or even exceeding current demands in performance. The requirements are summarized for the production and application of plant&#8208;based optically functional materials in different smart material applications and the review is concluded with a perspective about this active field of knowledge.

Nonlinear multi&#8208;quantum&#8208;well&#8208;based metasurfaces for frequency upconversion are enhanced by taking advantage of a pumping scheme coherently coupled with unpopulated upper electron subbands. This pumping scheme, combined with optimized material and metasurface designs, avoids saturation at practical levels of continuous&#8208;wave pump intensities, yielding larger upconversion efficiencies than in conventional approaches.








Abstract
Engineered intersubband transitions in semiconductor heterostructures featuring multiple quantum wells (MQWs) are shown to support record&#8208;high second&#8208;order nonlinear susceptibilities. By integrating these materials in metasurfaces with tailored optical resonances, it is possible to further enhance photonic interactions, yielding giant nonlinear responses in ultrathin devices. These metasurfaces form a promising platform for efficient nonlinear processes, including frequency upconversion of low&#8208;intensity thermal infrared radiation and harmonic generation, free of phase&#8208;matching constraints intrinsic to bulk nonlinear crystals. However, nonlinear saturation at moderately large pump intensities due to the transfer of electron population into excited subbands facilitated by strongly enhanced light&#8211;matter interactions in metasurfaces fundamentally limits their overall efficiency for various nonlinear processes. Here, the saturation limits of nonlinear MQW&#8208;based metasurfaces for mid&#8208;infrared frequency upconversion are significantly extended by optimizing their designs for excitation with a strong pump coherently coupled with unpopulated upper electron subbands. This counterintuitive pumping scheme, combined with tailored material and photonic engineering of the metasurface, avoids saturation at practical levels of continuous&#8208;wave pump intensities, yielding significantly larger upconversion efficiencies than in conventional approaches. The present results open new opportunities for nonlinear metasurfaces, less limited by saturation mechanisms, with important implications for night&#8208;vision imaging and compact nonlinear wave mixing&#160;systems.

         <title>A Logic&#8208;based Diagnostic and Therapeutic Hydrogel with Multi&#8208;stimuli Responsiveness to Orchestrate Diabetic Bone Regeneration</title>

Abstract
The regeneration of diabetic bone defects remains challenging as the innate healing process is impaired by glucose fluctuation (GF), reactive oxygen species (ROS) and over&#8208;expression of proteinases (such as matrix metalloproteinases, MMPs). A &#8220;diagnostic&#8221; and therapeutic dual logic&#8208;based hydrogel for diabetic bone regeneration is therefore developed through the design of a double&#8208;network hydrogel consisting of phenyboronic acid&#8208;crosslinked polyvinyl alcohol and gelatin colloids. It exhibited a &#8220;diagnostic&#8220; logic to interpret pathological cues (GF, ROS, MMPs) and determine when to release drug in a diabetic microenvironment and a therapeutic logic to program different cargo release to match immune&#8208;osteo cascade for better tissue regeneration. The hydrogel was also shown to be mechanically adaptable to the local complexity at the bone defect. Furthermore, the underlying therapeutic mechanism was elucidated whereby the logic&#8208;based cargo release enabled the regulation of macrophage polarization by remodeling the mitochondria&#8208;related antioxidative system, resulting in enhanced osteogenesis in diabetic bone defects. In conclusion, our study provides critical insight into the design and biological mechanism of dual logic&#8208;based tissue engineering strategies for diabetic bone regeneration.

         <title>Highly Bright AIE Nanoparticles by Regulating the Substituent of Rhodanine for Precise Early Detection of Atherosclerosis and Drug Screening</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Fluorescent probes capable of precise detection of atherosclerosis (AS) at an early stage and fast assessment of anti&#8208;AS drugs in animal level are particularly valuable. Herein, we introduce a highly bright aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) nanoprobe by regulating the substituent of rhodanine for early detection of atherosclerotic plaque and screening of anti&#8208;AS drugs in a precise, sensitive and rapid manner. With dicyanomethylene&#8208;substituted rhodanine as the electron&#8208;withdrawing unit, the AIE luminogen named TPE&#8208;T&#8208;RCN shows the highest molar extinction coefficient, the largest photoluminescence quantum yield and the most red&#8208;shifted absorption/emission spectra simultaneously as compared to the control compounds. The nanoprobes are obtained with an amphiphilic co&#8208;polymer as the matrix encapsulating TPE&#8208;T&#8208;RCN molecules, which are further surface functionalized with anti&#8208;CD47 antibody for specifically binding to CD47 overexpressed in AS plaques. Such nanoprobes allow efficient recognition of AS plaques at different stages in apolipoprotein E&#8208;deficient (apoE&#8211;/&#8211;) mice, especially for the recognition of early&#8208;stage AS plaques prior to Micro&#8208;CT and MRI imaging. These features impel us to apply the nanoprobes in monitoring the therapeutic effects of anti&#8208;AS drugs, providing a powerful tool for anti&#8208;AS drug screening. Their potential use in targeted imaging of human carotid plaque is further demonstrated.

         <title>A High&#8208;Performance Nonfused Wide&#8208;Bandgap Acceptor for Versatile Photovoltaic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new wide&#8208;bandgap nonfused nonfullerene acceptor named GS&#8208;ISO is designed and synthesized. GS&#8208;ISO exhibits a very flat molecular backbone and stable molecular conformation. Based on GS&#8208;ISO, outstanding power conversion efficiencies of over 19% (AM 1.5G, 100&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2) for a tandem organic photovoltaic (OPV) cell and over 28% (500&#160;lux, 2700&#160;K LED) for an indoor OPV cell are achieved.








Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) with nonfused conjugated structures play a critical role in organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells. Here, NFAs named GS&#8208;OEH, GS&#8208;OC6, and GS&#8208;ISO, with optical bandgaps larger than 1.70&#160;eV, are synthesized without using the fused ring structures. Compared with GS&#8208;OEH and GS&#8208;OC6, GS&#8208;ISO exhibits much stronger crystallinity, leading to a smaller energetic disorder and a larger exciton diffusion coefficient. GS&#8208;ISO also possesses a higher electroluminescence external quantum efficiency of 1.0&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2. The OPV cell based on PBDB&#8208;TF:GS&#8208;ISO demonstrates a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.62% under the standard one sun illumination. Besides, the PBDB&#8208;TF:GS&#8208;ISO&#8208;based cell with effective area of 1.0&#160;cm2&#160;exhibits a PCE of 28.37% under 2700&#160;K illumination of 500&#160;lux. A tandem OPV cell using PBDB&#8208;TF:GS&#8208;ISO as the front subcell shows an outstanding efficiency of 19.10%. Importantly, the GS&#8208;ISO&#8208;based OPV cell exhibits promising stability under the continuous illumination of simulated sunlight. This study indicates that the molecular design strategy demonstrated in this work has great superiority in developing nonfused NFAs and also that GS&#8208;ISO is a promising WBG acceptor for versatile photovoltaic applications.

         <title>Designing Angstrom&#8208;Scale Asymmetric MOF&#8208;on&#8208;MOF Cavities for High Monovalent Ion Selectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Biological ion channels feature angstrom&#8208;scale asymmetrical cavity structures, which are the key to achieving highly efficient separation and sensing of alkali metal ions from aqueous resources. The clean energy future and lithium&#8208;based energy storage systems heavily rely on highly efficient ionic separations. However, artificial recreation of such a sophisticated biostructure has been technically challenging. Here, we introduced a highly tunable design concept to fabricate monovalent ion&#8208;selective membranes with asymmetric sub&#8208;nanometer pores in which energy barriers are implanted. The energy barriers act as walls and baffles against ionic movements, which holds the target ion while facilitating the transport of competing ions. The membrane is consisted of bilayer metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOF&#8208;on&#8208;MOF), possessing a 6 to 3.4&#8208;angstrom passable converting cavity structure. The ionic current measurements exhibited an unprecedented ionic current rectification ratio of above 100 with exceptionally high selectivity ratios of 84 and 80 for K+/Li and Na+/ Li, respectively (1.14 Li+ mol.m&#8722;2.h&#8722;1). Furthermore, using quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics, we showed that the combined effect of spatial hindrance that creates energy surge walls and nucleophilic entrapment induces energy surge baffles and is responsible for the ultrahigh selectivity and rectifying performance of the membranes. This work demonstrates a striking advance in developing monovalent ion&#8208;selective channels and has implications in sensing, energy storage and separation technologies.

         <title>Large&#8208;Scale and Wide&#8208;Gamut Coloration at the Diffraction Limit in Flexible, Self&#8208;Assembled Hierarchical Nanomaterials</title>

Abstract
Unveiling physical phenomena that generate controllable structural coloration are at the center of significant research efforts due to the platform potential for the next generation of printing, sensing, displays, wearable optoelectronics components, and smart fabrics. Colors based on e&#8208;beam facilities possess high resolutions above 100K DPI, but limit manufacturing scales up to 4.37&#160;cm2, while requiring rigid substrates that are not flexible. State&#8208;of&#8208;art scalable techniques, on the contrary, provide either narrow gamuts or small resolutions. A common issue of current methods is also a heterogeneous resolution, which typically changes with the color printed. Here we&#160;demonstrate a structural coloration platform with broad gamuts exceeding the red, green, and blue (RGB) spectrum in inexpensive, thermal resistant, flexible and metallic&#8208;free structures at constant 101600 DPI (at the diffraction limit), obtained via mass&#8208;production manufacturing. This platform exploits a previously unexplored physical mechanism, which leverages the interplay between strong scattering modes and optical resonances excited in fully three&#8208;dimensional dielectric nanostructures with suitably engineered longitudinal profiles. The colors obtained with this technology are scalable to any area, demonstrated up to the single wafer (4&#8208;inch). These results open real&#8208;world applications of inexpensive, high&#8208;resolution, large&#8208;scale structural colors with broad chromatic spectra.

         <title>Boosting Reversibility and Stability of Li Storage in SnO2&#8208;Mo Multilayers: Introduction of Interfacial Oxygen Redistribution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Among the promising high capacity anode materials, tin dioxide (SnO2) represents a classic and important candidate that involves both conversion and alloying reactions toward Li storage. However, the inferior reversibility of conversion reactions usually results in low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE, &#8764;60%), small reversible capacity and poor cycling stability of electrodes. Here, we demonstrate that by carefully designing the interface structure of SnO2&#8208;Mo, a breakthrough comprehensive performance with ultrahigh average ICE up to 92.6%, large capacity of 1067&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 and 100% capacity retention after 700 cycles can be realized in a multilayer Mo/SnO2/Mo electrode. Furthermore, high capacity retentions can also be achieved in pouch&#8208;type Mo/SnO2/Mo||Li half cells and Mo/SnO2/Mo||LiFePO4 full cells. The amorphous SnO2/Mo interfaces, which are induced by redistribution of oxygen atoms between SnO2 and Mo, can precisely adjust the reversible capacity and cycling stability of the multilayers, while the stable capacities of electrodes are parabolic with the interfacial density. Theoretical calculations and in/ex&#8208;situ experimental investigation clearly reveal that oxygen redistribution in the SnO2/Mo hetero&#8208;interfaces boosts the Li ions transport kinetics by inducing a built&#8208;in electric field and improves the reaction reversibility of SnO2. This work provides a new understanding of the interface&#8208;performance relationship of metal&#8208;oxide hybrid electrodes and pivotal guidance for creating high performance Li&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Resolving the Spatial Variation and Correlation of Hyperfine Spin Properties in Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Devices which exploit the quantum properties of materials are widespread, with quantum information processors and quantum sensors showing significant progress. Organic materials offer interesting opportunities for quantum technologies owing to their engineerable spin properties, with spintronic operation and spin resonance magnetic&#8208;field sensing demonstrated in research grade devices, as well as proven compatibility with large scale fabrication techniques. Yet several important challenges remain as we move toward scaling these proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle quantum devices to larger integrated logic systems or spatially smaller sensing elements, particularly those associated with the variation of quantum properties both within and between devices. Here, spatially resolved magnetoluminescence is used to provide the first two&#8208;dimensional map of a hyperfine spin property &#8211; the Overhauser field &#8211; in traditional organic light emitting diodes. We find intra&#8208;device variabilities exceeding 20% while spatially correlated behavior is exhibited on lengths beyond 7&#160;&#956;m, similar in size to pixels in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art AMOLED arrays, which has implications for the reproducibility and integration of organic quantum devices.

         <title>Prussian blue analogues for sodium&#8208;ion batteries: past, present and future</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have attracted wide attention for their application in the energy storage and conversion field due to their low cost, facile synthesis, and appreciable electrochemical performance. At the present stage, most research on PBAs is focused on their material&#8208;level optimization, whereas their properties in practical battery systems are seldom considered. This review aims to first provide an overview of the history and parameters of PBA materials and analyze the fundamental principles toward rational design of PBAs, and then evaluate the prospects and challenges for PBAs for practical sodium&#8208;ion batteries, hoping to bridge the gap between laboratory research and commercial reality.

         <title>Reversible Manipulation of Photoconductivity Caused by Surface Oxygen Vacancies in Perovskite Stannates with Ultraviolet Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8211;matter interaction under different oxygen pressure can reversibly manipulate photoconductivity from surface oxygen vacancies of perovskite stannate semiconductors. Utilizing surface&#8208;selective photochemical reaction combined with the low oxygen&#8208;diffusion coefficient, ultraviolet&#8208;light&#8208;excited electron&#8211;hole pairs of the perovskite compound under low oxygen pressure accelerate the unprecedented formation of spatially&#160;confined and optically&#160;programmable in&#8208;gap states induced by oxygen vacancies at room temperature.








Abstract
Programmable optoelectronic devices call for the reversible control of the photocarrier recombination process by in&#8208;gap states in oxide semiconductors. However, previous approaches to produce oxygen vacancies as a source of in&#8208;gap states in oxide semiconductors have hampered the reversible formation of oxygen vacancies and their related phenomena. Here, a new strategy to manipulate the 2D photoconductivity from perovskite stannates is demonstrated by exploiting spatially&#160;selective photochemical reaction under ultraviolet illumination at room temperature. Remarkably, the ideal trap&#8208;free photocurrent of air&#8208;illuminated BaSnO3 (&#8776;200&#160;pA) is reversibly switched into three orders of magnitude higher photocurrent of vacuum&#8208;illuminated BaSnO3 (&#8776;335&#160;nA) with persistent photoconductivity depending on ambient oxygen pressure under illumination. Multiple characterizations elucidate that ultraviolet illumination of BaSnO3&#160;under low oxygen pressure induces surface oxygen vacancies as a result of surface photolysis combined with the low oxygen&#8208;diffusion coefficient of BaSnO3; the concentrated oxygen vacancies are likely to induce a two&#8208;step transition of photocurrent response by changing the characteristics of in&#8208;gap states from the shallow level to the deep level. These results suggest a novel strategy that uses light&#8211;matter interaction in a reversible and spatially&#160;confined way to manipulate functionalities related to surface defect states, for the emerging applications using newly discovered oxide semiconductors.

Metasurfaces based on disordered arrangements of silicon nanoresonators are used to implement wavelength&#8208;selective optical diffusers with nearly Lambertian scattering profiles and a high tolerance for incidence angles and polarizations. Their working principles and scattering performances are discussed on the basis of exhaustive experimental and numerical studies. Such diffusers open new opportunities in applications like fluorescence microscopy, augmented reality displays, or wavefront&#8208;shaping.








Abstract
Conventional optical diffusers, such as thick volume scatterers (Rayleigh scattering) or microstructured surface scatterers (geometric scattering), lack the potential for on&#8208;chip integration and are thus incompatible with next&#8208;generation photonic devices. Dielectric Huygens&#8217; metasurfaces, on the other hand, consist of 2D arrangements of resonant dielectric nanoparticles and therefore constitute a promising material platform for ultrathin and highly efficient photonic devices. When the nanoparticles are arranged in a random but statistically specific fashion, diffusers with exceptional properties are expected to come within reach. This work explores how dielectric Huygens&#8217; metasurfaces can implement wavelength&#8208;selective diffusers with negligible absorption losses and nearly Lambertian scattering profiles that are largely independent of the angle and polarization of incident waves. The combination of tailored positional disorder with a carefully balanced electric and magnetic response of the nanoparticles is shown to be an integral requirement for the operation as a diffuser. The proposed metasurfaces&#8217; directional scattering performance is characterized both experimentally and numerically, and their usability in wavefront&#8208;shaping applications is highlighted. Since the metasurfaces operate on the principles of Mie scattering and are embedded in a glassy environment, they may easily be incorporated in integrated photonic devices, fiber optics, or mechanically robust augmented reality displays.

         <title>Boosting Piezoelectricity under Illumination via the Bulk Photovoltaic Effect and the Schottky Barrier Effect in BiFeO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enhancement of piezoelectricity by external stimuli is advantageous for its simple and in situ control, and compatibility with other functionalities. In this work, light is shown to be a powerful control parameter to induce a sevenfold enhancement of piezoelectric coefficient in BiFeO3 single crystals due to the bulk photovoltaic and Schottky barrier effects, offering potential for multifunctional optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
Piezoelectricity is a key functionality induced by conversion between mechanical and electrical energy. Enhancement of piezoelectricity in ferroelectrics often has been realized by complicated synthetical approaches to host unique structural boundaries, so&#8208;called morphotropic phase boundaries. While structural approaches are well&#8208;known, enhancing piezoelectricity by external stimuli has yet to be clearly explored, despite their advantages of offering not only simple and in situ control without any prior processing requirement, but compatibility with other functionalities. Here, it is shown that light is a powerful control parameter to enhance the piezoelectric property of BiFeO3 single crystals. A series of measurements based on piezoresponse force microscopy and conductive atomic force microscopy, under illumination, reveal a locally enhanced effective piezoelectric coefficient, dzz, eventually showing almost a sevenfold increase. This phenomenon is explained with theoretical models by introducing the two main underlying mechanisms attributed to the bulk photovoltaic effect and Schottky barrier effect, involving the role of open&#8208;circuit voltage and photocharge carrier density. These results provide key insights to light&#8208;induced piezoelectricity enhancement, offering its potential for multifunctional optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Covalent&#8208;Linking&#8208;Enabled Superior Compatibility of ZIF&#8208;8 Hybrid Membrane for Efficient Propylene Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superior interfacial compatibility in metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) hybrid membranes is achieved by linking functionalized ZIF&#8208;8 and polymeric PIM&#8208;1 through chemical bonds. The fabricated membrane exhibits the highest C3H6 permeability and remarkable selectivity for C3H6 over C3H8 among ZIF analogs, potentially for efficient propylene separation.








Abstract
The interface is a critical issue for metal&#8211;organic&#8208;framework hybrid membranes in propylene separation. Here, a covalent&#8208;linking strategy is reported for strikingly reinforcing the interfacial compatibility in a ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;based membrane. A functionalized ZIF&#8208;8 material named ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;CN is synthesized using the mixed&#8208;ligand approach. ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;CN has an identical crystalline structure to ZIF&#8208;8, and the 4,5&#8208;dicyanoimidazole ligand is available for further functionalization. Covalent linkage of ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;CN with PIM&#8208;1 is driven by the thermal reaction of the cyano groups on both entities, which strengthens the filler&#8211;polymer connection in the ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;CN@tPIM&#8208;1 membrane. ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;CN@tPIM&#8208;1 exhibits remarkably enhanced propylene permeation property with C3H6/C3H8 selectivity of &#8776;28, which is 350% and 180% higher than those on non&#8208;treated ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;CN/PIM&#8208;1 and non&#8208;functionalized ZIF&#8208;8@tPIM&#8208;1, respectively. Additionally, ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;CN@tPIM&#8208;1 shows the highest C3H6 permeability of &#8776;370 Barrer among all relevant ZIF&#8208;8 membranes. This strategy opens an avenue for precise interface engineering in membranes and the resultant high performance is appealing in the propylene separation industry.

         <title>Additive Manufacturing of Ti3C2&#8208;MXene&#8208;Functionalized Conductive Polymer Hydrogels for Electromagnetic&#8208;Interference Shielding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aqueous Ti3C2&#8208;MXene&#8208;functionalized poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate ink is developed for 3D printing to precisely create 3D architectures with high design freedom and a post&#8208;printing freeze&#8211;thawing treatment protocol is proposed to transform the as&#8208;printed objects into highly conductive and robust hydrogels with high fidelity on both the macro&#8208; and microscale, enabling customizable applications.








Abstract
The ongoing miniaturization of devices and development of wireless and implantable technologies demand electromagnetic interference (EMI)&#8208;shielding materials with customizability. Additive manufacturing of conductive polymer hydrogels with favorable conductivity and biocompatibility can offer new opportunities for EMI&#8208;shielding applications. However, simultaneously achieving high conductivity, design freedom, and shape fidelity in 3D printing of conductive polymer hydrogels is still very challenging. Here, an aqueous Ti3C2&#8208;MXene&#8208;functionalized poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate ink is developed for extrusion printing to create 3D objects with arbitrary geometries, and a freeze&#8211;thawing protocol is proposed to transform the printed objects directly into highly conductive and robust hydrogels with high shape fidelity on both the macro&#8208; and microscale. The as&#8208;obtained hydrogel exhibits a high conductivity of 1525.8 S m&#8211;1 at water content up to 96.6 wt% and also satisfactory mechanical properties with flexibility, stretchability, and fatigue resistance. Furthermore, the use of the printed hydrogel for customizable EMI&#8208;shielding applications is demonstrated. The proposed easy&#8208;to&#8208;manufacture approach, along with the highlighted superior properties, expands the potential of conductive polymer hydrogels in future customizable applications and represents a real breakthrough from the current state of the art.

         <title>Single&#8208;, Dual&#8208;, Triple, and Quad&#8208;wavelength Surface&#8208;emitting Lasing in Blue Phase Liquid Crystal</title>

Abstract
Soft organic lasers with multi&#8208;wavelength output and high spectral purity are of crucial importance for versatile photonic devices owing to their monochromaticity, coherence, and high intensity.&#160;However, there remain challenges for the achievement of&#160;surface&#8208;emitting multi&#8208;wavelength lasing in soft photonic crystals, and the relative mechanisms need to be investigated. Herein, single&#8208;, dual&#8208;, triple&#8208;, and quad&#8208;wavelength lasers are successfully achieved in dye&#8208;doped blue phase liquid crystal (BPLC) film. The number and wavelength of lasing peaks can be manipulated by tuning the center of the bandgap, order parameter of the laser dye, quality of the resonance cavity, temperature, and even the pump energy of the pump light. For single&#8208;wavelength lasing, &#160;a lasing peak with&#160;an ultra&#8208;narrow linewidth of 0.04&#160;nm (Q factor of 13454) is achieved. The multi&#8208;wavelength lasing is attained based on the following aspects: (i) narrow bandgaps of BPLCs with&#160;full width at half maximum of 14&#8211;20&#160;nm; (ii) a laser dye with high gain over a wide wavelength band, having a low&#8208;order parameter in the liquid crystal matrix; (iii) appropriate relative positions between the reflection and fluorescence peaks; and (iv) highly ordered crystal lattice of BPLC film. The proposed single&#8208;to&#8208;quad&#8208;wavelength surface&#8208;emitting lasers can be employed as coherent light sources for next&#8208;generation optical devices.

The multi-wavelength lasing is attained based on the following aspects: (i) narrow bandgaps of BPLCs with&#160;full width at half maximum of 14&#8211;20&#160;nm; (ii) a laser dye with high gain over a wide wavelength band, having a low-order parameter in the liquid crystal matrix; (iii) appropriate relative positions between the reflection and fluorescence peaks; and (iv) highly ordered crystal lattice of BPLC film. The proposed single-to-quad-wavelength surface-emitting lasers can be employed as coherent light sources for next-generation optical devices.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Engineering Multienzyme&#8208;mimicking Covalent Organic Frameworks as Pyroptosis Inducers for Boosting Antitumor Immunity</title>

Abstract
We report the engineering of a series of multienzyme&#8208;mimicking covalent organic frameworks (COFs), COF&#8208;909&#8208;Cu, COF&#8208;909&#8208;Fe, and COF&#8208;909&#8208;Ni, as pyroptosis inducers remodeling the tumor microenvironment to boost cancer immunotherapy. Mechanistic studies revealed that these COFs could serve as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) homeostasis disruptors to elevate intracellular H2O2 levels, and they not only exhibited excellent superoxide dismutase (SOD)&#8208;mimic activity and converted superoxide radicals (O2&#8226;&#8259;) to H2O2 to facilitate H2O2 generation; but also possessed outstanding glutathione peroxidase (GPx)&#8208;mimic activity and depleted glutathione (GSH) to alleviate the scavenging of H2O2. Meanwhile, the outstanding photothermal therapy properties of these COFs could accelerate the Fenton&#8208;like ionization process to facilitate their chemodynamic therapy efficiency. One member, COF&#8208;909&#8208;Cu, can robustly induce gasdermin E (GSDME)&#8208;dependent pyroptosis and remodel the tumor microenvironment to trigger durable antitumor immunity, thus promoting the response rate of &#945;PD&#8208;1 checkpoint blockade and successfully restraining tumor metastasis and recurrence.

         <title>Surfaces decorated with enantiomorphically pure polymer nanohelices via hierarchical chirality transfer across multiple length scales</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Mesoscale chiral materials have been prepared by lithographic methods, assembly of chiral building blocks, and through syntheses in the presence of polarised light. Typically, these processes result in micrometer&#8208;sized structures, require complex top&#8208;down manipulation, or rely on tedious asymmetric separation. We discovered that the chemical vapor deposition of chiral precursors into supported films of liquid crystals (LCs) results in superhierarchical arrangements of enantiomorphically pure nanofibers. Depending on the molecular chirality of the 1&#8208;hydroxyethyl [2.2]paracyclophane precursor, extended arrays of enantiomorphic nanohelices are formed from achiral nematic templates. Arrays of chiral nanohelices extend over hundreds of microns and consistently display enantiomorphic micropatterns. The pitch of individual nanohelices depend on the enantiomeric excess and the purity of the chiral precursor, consistent with the theoretical model of a doubly&#8208;twisted LC director configuration. During CVD of chiral precursors into cholesteric LC films, aspects of molecular and mesoscale asymmetry combine constructively to form regularly twisted nanohelices. Enantiomorphic surfaces permit the tailoring of a wide range of functional properties, such as the asymmetric induction of weak chiral systems.

         <title>Wearable Microneedle&#8208;Based Extended Gate Transistor for Real&#8208;Time Detection of Sodium in Interstitial Fluids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Dysnatremia, a disorder in the concentration of sodium levels, possesses a clinical challenge leading to adverse health complications. Using biosensors for online sodium monitoring can be a promising approach to overcome this condition. In this regard, biosensors based on field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) have promising advantages, including high sensitivity, quick response, and easy fabrication. Most of the currently developed FET designs are used only for sensing sweat and in&#8208;vitro blood/interstitial fluids (ISF). Using ISF for online detection of biomarkers and long&#8208;term health monitoring with FETs has not yet been fully resolved. Herein we propose an innovative stretchable skin&#8208;conformal fast&#8208;response microneedle extended&#8208;gate FET (MN&#8208;EGFET) biosensor for real&#8208;time detection of sodium in the ISF for minimally invasive health monitoring along with high sensitivity, low limit of detection, excellent biocompatibility, and on&#8208;body mechanical stability. This platform can, furthermore, be integrated with wireless&#8208;data transmitter and the Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things (IoT) cloud for real&#8208;time monitoring and long&#8208;term analysis.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Programmable Microgel Lasers for Information Encoding and Anticounterfeiting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Microscale laser emissions have emerged as a promising approach for information encoding and anticounterfeiting for their feature&#8208;rich spectra and high sensitivity to surrounding environment. Compared with artificial materials, natural responsive biomaterials enable a higher level of complexity and versatile ways for tailoring optical responses. However, precise control of lasing wavelengths and spatial locations with biomolecules remains a huge challenge. Here, we developed a biological programmable laser, in which lasing could be manipulated by biomolecular activities at the nanoscale. Tunable lasing wavelengths were achieved by exploiting swelling properties of enzyme&#8208;responsive hydrogel droplets in a Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot microcavity. Both experimental and theoretical means demonstrate that inner 3D network structures and external curvature of hydrogel droplets lead to different lasing thresholds and resonance wavelengths. Finally, inkjet&#8208;printed multiwavelength laser encoding and anticounterfeiting were showcased under different scalability and environment. Hyperspectral laser images were utilized as an advanced feature for higher level of security. The biological encoded laser will provide a new insight into the development of bio&#8208;synthetic and bio&#8208;programmable laser devices, offering new opportunities for secure communication and smart sensing.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Mediated Intracellular Polymerization of AIEgens for Light&#8208;Up Tumor Localization and Theranostics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aggregation&#8208;induced emission fluorogen&#8208;peptide conjugates (D2P1) and 3CBT that can undergo in situ polymerization to form aggregates in tumor cells are rationally designed. Upon tumor&#8208;specific cathepsin B enzyme reactions, the peptide cleavage on D2P1 induces covalent polymerization between 3CBT, which triggers aggregation and accumulation of D2P1 into the tumor site, resulting in enhanced fluorescence signal and tumor treatment efficacy.








Abstract
Improving the enrichment of drugs or theranostic agents within tumors is vital to achieve effective cancer diagnosis and therapy with reduced dosage and damage to normal tissues. In this work, an enzyme&#8208;mediated aggregation&#8208;induced emission fluorogen (AIEgen) intracellular polymerization strategy that can simultaneously promote the accumulation and retention of the AIEgen in the tumor for prolonged imaging and enhanced tumor growth inhibition is described. An AIEgen&#8208;peptide conjugate (D2P1) and cyanobenzothiazole&#8208;cysteine (3CBT) that can undergo rapid condensation reaction to form nanoaggregates in tumor cells are rationally designed. Upon tumor&#8208;specific cathepsin protease reaction, the cleavage of peptides induces condensate polymerization between the exposed cysteine and 2&#8208;cyanobenzothiazole on 3CBT, triggering accumulation of D2P1 into the tumor site, leading to fluorescence light&#8208;up. Such enzyme&#8208;mediated polymerization of D2P1 and 3CBT alters cellular motility via disrupting actin organization and in turn inhibiting cell proliferation. In addition, due to the built&#8208;in intrinsic photosensitization property of the AIEgen, the accumulation of D2P1 can remarkably promote the tumor photodynamic therapy effect in vivo under light irradiation. This study thus represents the enzyme&#8208;mediated intracellular polymerization system with high potential to improve the diagnostic and therapeutic outcomes of tumors in vivo.

         <title>Ultrahigh&#8208;Performance Optoelectronic Skin Based on Intrinsically Stretchable Perovskite&#8208;Polymer Heterojunction Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a surface energy&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly methodology is developed to form easily transferrable and flexible perovskite quantum dot (PQD) films with a worm&#8208;like morphology. Furthermore, intrinsically stretchable phototransistors (ISTPTs) are fabricated based on an ultra&#8208;flexible photosensitive heterojunction consisting of worm&#8208;like PQD films and polymer semiconductor. The resulting ISTPTs demonstrate highly sensitive respond to high&#8208;energy photons of X&#8208;ray and UV even under 100% tensile strain.








Abstract
The optoelectronic skin is acknowledged as the world's current cutting&#8208;edge technology in the fields of wearable healthcare monitoring, soft robotics, artificial retinas, and so on. However, the difficulty in preparing stretchable photosensitive polymers and the high&#8208;crystallization nature of most reported photosensitive materials (such as perovskites) severely restrict the development of skin&#8208;like optoelectronic devices. Herein, a surface energy&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly methodology is proposed to form easily transferrable and flexible perovskite quantum dot (PQD) films with a worm&#8208;like morphology. Furthermore, intrinsically stretchable phototransistors (ISTPTs) are fabricated based on a stretchable photosensitive layer heterojunction consisting of worm&#8208;like PQD films and hybrid polymer semiconductors. The obtained ISTPTs display highly sensitive response to high&#8208;energy photons of X&#8208;ray (with a detection limit of 79 nGy s&#8722;1, that is 560 times lower than commercial medical chest X&#8208;ray diagnosis) and ultraviolet (with photosensitivity of 5 &#215; 106 and detectable light intensity of 50 nW cm&#8722;2 among the highest performance of reported photodetectors). In addition, these ISTPTs demonstrate desirable e&#8208;skin characteristics with high strain tolerance, high sensing specificity, high optical transparency, and good skin conformability. The surface energy&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly methodology for the preparation of ISTPTs is a critical demonstration to enable low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance optoelectronic skins.

         <title>Intrinsic Wettability in Pristine Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the assistance of environmental scanning electron microscope, the high hydrophilic nature of pristine graphene with an extremely low water contact angle of &#8776;30&#176; is confirmed, using the suspended, superclean graphene membrane to exclude the interference by substrates and contamination. This high hydrophilicity is revealed to originate from the charge transfer between graphene and water molecules through H&#8211;&#960; interaction.








Abstract
The wettability of graphene remains controversial owing to its high sensitivity to the surroundings, which is reflected by the wide range of reported water contact angle (WCA). Specifically, the surface contamination and underlying substrate would strongly alter the intrinsic wettability of graphene. Here, the intrinsic wettability of graphene is investigated by measuring WCA on suspended, superclean graphene membrane using environmental scanning electron microscope. An extremely low WCA with an average value &#8776;30&#176; is observed, confirming the hydrophilic nature of pristine graphene. This high hydrophilicity originates from the charge transfer between graphene and water molecules through H&#8211;&#960; interaction. The work provides a deep understanding of the water&#8211;graphene interaction and opens up a new way for measuring the surface properties of 2D materials.

         <title>Recent Advances in Delivery Systems for Genetic and Other Novel Vaccines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Vaccination is one of the most successful and cost&#8208;effective prophylactic measures against diseases, especially infectious diseases including smallpox and polio. However, the development of effective prophylactic or therapeutic vaccines for other diseases such as cancer remains challenging. This is often due to the imprecise control of vaccine activity in vivo which leads to insufficient/inappropriate immune responses or short immune memory. The development of new vaccine types in recent decades has created the potential for improving the protective potency against these diseases. Genetic and subunit vaccines are two major categories of these emerging vaccines. Owing to their nature, they rely heavily on delivery systems with various functions, such as effective cargo protection, immunogenicity enhancement, targeted delivery, sustained release of antigens, selective activation of humoral and/or cellular immune responses against specific antigens, and reduced adverse effects. Therefore, vaccine delivery systems may significantly affect the final outcome of genetic and other novel vaccines and are vital for their development. This review introduces these studies based on their research emphasis on functional design or administration route optimization, presents recent progress, and discusses features of new vaccine delivery systems, providing an overview of this field.

         <title>Scalable Polyimide&#8208;Poly(Amic Acid) Copolymer Based Nanocomposites for High&#8208;Temperature Capacitive Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To develop scalable, high&#8208;temperature capacitors, polyimide&#8208;poly(amic acid) copolymer&#8208;based nanocomposites with very low amount of boron nitride nanosheets are designed. The outstanding energy density of &#8776;1.38 J cm&#8722;3 with high efficiency of &gt;96%&#160;is achieved at 150&#160;&#176;C under 200 MV m&#8722;1 (working conditions in hybrid electric vehicles), &#8776;2.5 times higher than the room&#8208;temperature performance of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art biaxially oriented polypropylene.








Abstract
The developments of next&#8208;generation electric power systems and electronics demand for high temperature (&#8776;150&#160;&#176;C), high energy density, high efficiency, scalable, and low&#8208;cost polymer&#8208;based dielectric capacitors are still scarce. Here, the nanocomposites based on polyimide&#8208;poly(amic acid) copolymers with a very low amount of boron nitride nanosheets are designed and synthesized. Under the actual working condition in hybrid electric vehicles of 200 MV m&#8722;1 and 150&#160;&#176;C, a high energy density of 1.38 J cm&#8722;3 with an efficiency higher than 96% is achieved. This is about 2.5 times higher than the room temperature energy density (&#8776;0.39 J cm&#8722;3 under 200 MV m&#8722;1) of the commercially used biaxially oriented polypropylene, the benchmark of dielectric polymer. Especially, the energy density and efficiency at 150&#160;&#176;C show no sign of degradation after 20&#160;000 cycles of charge&#8208;discharge test and 35 days&#8217; high&#8208;temperature endurance test. This research provides an effective and low&#8208;cost strategy to develop high&#8208;temperature polymer&#8208;based capacitors.

         <title>In&#8208;Memory Realization of Eligibility Traces Based on Conductance Drift of Phase Change Memory for Energy&#8208;Efficient Reinforcement Learning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, in&#8208;memory realization of eligibility trace for energy&#8208;efficient reinforcement learning (RL) with outstanding performance in discrete&#8208; and continuous&#8208;state RL tasks is presented. For the first time, the inherent conductance drift of phase change memory is exploited as physical decay function to realize in&#8208;memory eligibility trace, demonstrating excellent performance and significantly enhanced energy efficiency compared with traditional computing platforms.








Abstract
Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown outstanding performance in handling complex tasks in recent years. Eligibility trace (ET), a fundamental and important mechanism in reinforcement learning, records critical states with attenuation and guides the update of policy, which plays a crucial role in accelerating the convergence of RL training. However, ET implementation on conventional digital computing hardware is energy hungry and restricted by the memory wall due to massive calculation of exponential decay functions. Here, in&#8208;memory realization of ET for energy&#8208;efficient reinforcement learning with outstanding performance in discrete&#8208; and continuous&#8208;state RL tasks is demonstrated. For the first time, the inherent conductance drift of phase change memory is exploited as physical decay function to realize in&#8208;memory eligibility trace, demonstrating excellent performance during RL training in various tasks. The spontaneous in&#8208;memory decay computing and storage of policy in the same phase change memory give rise to significantly enhanced energy efficiency compared with traditional graphics processing unit platforms. This work therefore provides a holistic energy and hardware efficient method for both training and inference of reinforcement learning.

         <title>Self&#8208;Healing Hydrogel Embodied with Macrophage&#8208;Regulation and Responsive&#8208;Gene&#8208;Silencing Properties for Synergistic Prevention of Peritendinous Adhesion</title>

The MMP&#8208;2&#8208;degradable gelatin&#8208;methacryloyl (GelMA) microspheres (MSs) loading guanidinobenzoic acid&#8208;modified generation 5 polyamidoamine (G5&#8208;GBA)/Smad3&#8208;small interfering RNA (siRNA) nanoparticles (siRNA@MS) were fabricated by microfluidics technique, and then were incorporated into a self&#8208;healing hyaluronan (HA) hydrogel (siRNA@MS@HA) on the polycaprolactone (PCL) electrospun nanofibers to form peritendinous anti&#8208;adhesion membrane. Here it is hypothesized that Smad3&#8208;siRNA nanoparticles would be released from GelMA MSs responded to the elevation of MMP&#8208;2 after tendon injury, thus downregulating the expression of Smad3 and fibroblast proliferation in peritendinous area. Moreover, the hydrogel&#8208;electrospun nanofibers could attenuate inflammation and act as a physical barrier to prevent adhesion tissue invading into the repaired tendon.








Abstract
Antiadhesion barriers such as films and hydrogels used to wrap repaired tendons are important for preventing the formation of adhesion tissue after tendon surgery. However, sliding of the tendon can compress the adjacent hydrogel barrier and cause it to rupture, which may then lead to unexpected inflammation. Here, a self&#8208;healing and deformable hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogel is constructed as a peritendinous antiadhesion barrier. Matrix metalloproteinase&#8208;2 (MMP&#8208;2)&#8208;degradable gelatin&#8208;methacryloyl (GelMA) microspheres (MSs) encapsulated with Smad3&#8208;siRNA nanoparticles are entrapped within the HA hydrogel to inhibit fibroblast proliferation and prevent peritendinous adhesion. GelMA MSs are responsively degraded by upregulation of MMP&#8208;2, achieving on&#8208;demand release of siRNA nanoparticles. Silencing effect of Smad3&#8208;siRNA nanoparticles is around 75% toward targeted gene. Furthermore, the self&#8208;healing hydrogel shows relatively attenuated inflammation compared to non&#8208;healing hydrogel. The mean adhesion scores of composite barrier group are 1.67 &#177; 0.51 and 2.17 &#177; 0.75 by macroscopic and histological evaluation, respectively. The proposed self&#8208;healing hydrogel antiadhesion barrier with MMP&#8208;2&#8208;responsive drug release behavior is highly effective for decreasing inflammation and inhibiting tendon adhesion. Therefore, this research provides a new strategy for the development of safe and effective antiadhesion barriers.

         <title>Synchrotron X&#8208;ray Spectroscopic Investigations of In&#8208;Situ Formed Alloy Anodes for Magnesium Batteries</title>

Abstract
Magnesium batteries present high volumetric energy density and dendrite&#8208;free deposition of Mg, drawing wide attention in energy storage devices. However, its further development remains stagnated due to relevant interfacial issues between Mg anode and the electrolyte, and sluggish solid&#8208;state diffusion kinetics of Mg2+ ions. Herein, for the first time, we propose an in&#8208;situ conversion chemistry to construct a nanostructured Bi anode from bismuth selenide driven by Li+. Through the combination of operando synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction, ex&#8208;situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and comprehensive electrochemical tests, we demonstrate that the nanosize of the in&#8208;situ formed Bi crystals contributes to the fast Mg2+ diffusion kinetics and highly efficient Mg&#8208;Bi alloy/de&#8208;alloy. The resultant Bi anodes exhibit superior long&#8208;term cycling stability with over 600 cycles under a high current density of 1.0 A g&#8211;1. This work provides a new approach to construct alloy anode and paves the way for exploring novel electrode materials for magnesium batteries.

         <title>Engineering Electronic Band Structure of Binary Thermoelectric Nanocatalysts for Augmented Pyrocatalytic Tumor Nanotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance nanosized pyroelectric nanosystems, Bi13S18I2 nanorods, with excellent photothermal conversion and pyroelectric conversion capabilities are rationally engineered for pyroelectric&#8208;dynamic&#8208;therapy&#8208;augmented photonic tumor hyperthermia. The high&#8208;performance pyroelectric nanocatalysts are designed via reconstructing the band structures of canonical binary compounds.








Abstract
Photothermal therapy (PTT) has emerged as a distinct therapeutic modality owing to its noninvasiveness and spatiotemporal selectivity. However, heat&#8208;shock proteins (HSPs) endow tumor cells with resistance to heat&#8208;induced apoptosis, severely lowering the therapeutic efficacy of PTT. Here, a high&#8208;performance pyroelectric nanocatalyst, Bi13S18I2 nanorods (NRs), with prominent pyroelectric conversion and photothermal conversion performance for augmented pyrocatalytic tumor nanotherapy, is developed. Canonical binary compounds are reconstructed by inserting a third biocompatible agent, thus facilitating the formation of Bi13S18I2 NRs with enhanced pyrocatalytic conversion efficiency. Under 808&#160;nm laser irradiation, Bi13S18I2 NRs induce a conspicuous temperature elevation for photonic hyperthermia. In particular, Bi13S18I2 NRs harvest pyrocatalytic energy from the heating and cooling alterations to produce abundant reactive oxygen species, which results in the depletion of HSPs and hence the reduction of thermoresistance of tumor cells, thereby significantly augmenting the therapeutic efficacy of photothermal tumor hyperthermia. By synergizing the pyroelectric dynamic therapy with PTT, tumor suppression with a significant tumor inhibition rate of 97.2% is achieved after intravenous administration of Bi13S18I2 NRs and subsequent exposure to an 808&#160;nm laser. This work opens an avenue for the design of high&#8208;performance pyroelectric nanocatalysts by reconstructing canonical binary compounds for therapeutic applications in biocatalytic nanomedicine.

         <title>Light&#8208;Controlled Nucleation and Shaping of Self&#8208;Assembling Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling self&#8208;assembly is fundamentally challenging with implications for next&#8208;generation functional materials. Herein, light&#8208;controlled nucleation and growth is demonstrated for self&#8208;assembling composites according to precise user&#8208;defined designs. Light patterns enable positioning of composites in preassigned locations, sculpting of fine details and contours, and commanding the assembly of lines over millimeters with micrometer precision, hence combining the power of photolithography with self&#8208;assembly.








Abstract
Controlling self&#8208;assembly of nanocomposites is a fundamental challenge with exciting implications for next&#8208;generation advanced functional materials. Precursors for composites can be generated photochemically, but limited insight in the underlying processes has hindered precise hands&#8208;on guidance. In this study, light&#8208;controlled nucleation and growth is demonstrated for self&#8208;assembling composites according to precise user&#8208;defined designs. Carbonate is generated photochemically with UV light to steer the precipitation of nanocomposites of barium carbonate nanocrystals and amorphous silica (BaCO3/SiO2). Using a custom&#8208;built optical setup, the self&#8208;assembly process is controlled by optimizing the photogeneration, diffusion, reaction, and precipitation of the carbonate species, using the radius and intensity of the UV&#8208;light irradiated area and reaction temperature. Exploiting this control, nucleation is induced and the contours and individual features of the growing composite are sculpted according to micrometer&#8208;defined light patterns. Moreover, moving light patterns are exploited to create a constant carbonate concentration at the growth front to draw lines of nanocomposites with constant width over millimeters with micrometer precision. Light&#8208;directed generation of local gradients opens previously unimaginable opportunities for guiding self&#8208;assembly into functional materials.

&lt;p&gt;Controlling self-assembly is fundamentally challenging with implications for next-generation functional materials. Herein, light-controlled nucleation and growth is demonstrated for self-assembling composites according to precise user-defined designs. Light patterns enable positioning of composites in preassigned locations, sculpting of fine details and contours, and commanding the assembly of lines over millimeters with micrometer precision, hence combining the power of photolithography with self-assembly.

&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Electronically and Geometrically Modified Single&#8208;Atom Fe Sites by Adjacent Fe Nanoparticles for Enhanced Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The correlations between electronic and geometric structures of isolated Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C sites and their oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance are investigated by varying the secondary heat&#8208;treatment of a NC&#8208;supported Fe single&#8208;atom catalyst. The adjacent Fe nanoparticles can regulate the electronic and geometric structure of isolated Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C sites, reducing energy barriers of the rate&#8208;limiting steps of ORR, resulting in outstanding ORR performance.








Abstract
Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C materials exhibit excellent activity and stability for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), as one of the most promising candidates to replace commercial Pt/C catalysts. However, it is challenging to unravel features of the superior ORR activity originating from Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C materials. In this work, the electronic and geometric structures of the isolated Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C sites and their correlations with the ORR performance are investigated by varying the secondary thermal activation temperature of a rationally designed NC&#8208;supported Fe single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC). The systematic analyses demonstrate the significant role of coordinated atoms of SA and metallic Fe nanoparticles (NPs) in altering the electronic structure of isolated Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C sites. Meanwhile, strong interaction between isolated Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C sites and adjacent Fe NPs can change the geometric structure of isolated Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C sites. Theoretical calculations reveal that optimal regulation of the electronic and geometric structure of isolated Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C sites by the co&#8208;existence of Fe NPs narrows the energy barriers of the rate&#8208;limiting steps of ORR, resulting in outstanding ORR performance. This work not only provides the fundamental understanding of the underlying structure&#8211;activity relationship, but also sheds light on designing efficient Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts.

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Associated Immune Cell Mediated Tumor Targeting Mechanism with NIR&#8208;II Fluorescence Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The strategy of structure&#8208;inherent tumor targeting (SITT) with cyanine&#8208;based fluorophores is getting more attention because no chemical conjugation of targeting moieties is required. However, the targeting mechanism behind SITT has not yet been well explained. Here, we demonstrate that heptamethine cyanine&#8208;based fluorophores possess not only targetability of tumor microenvironments without the need for additional targeting ligands but also NIR&#8208;II imaging capabilities, i.e., minimum scattering and ultralow autofluorescence. The new SITT mechanism suggests that bone&#8208;marrow&#8208;derived and/or tissue&#8208;resident/tumor&#8208;associated immune cells can be a principal target for cancer detection due to their abundance in tumoral tissues. Among the tested, SH1 provides ubiquitous tumor targetability and a high tumor&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio (TBR) ranging from 9.5 to 47 in pancreatic, breast, and lung cancer mouse models upon a single bolus intravenous injection. Furthermore, SH1 can be used to detect small cancerous tissues smaller than 2&#8239;mm in diameter in orthotopic lung cancer models. Thus, SH1 could be a promising cancer&#8208;targeting agent and have a bright future for intraoperative optical imaging and image&#8208;guided cancer surgery.

Abstract
Advanced in vitro cell culture systems or microphysiological systems (MPSs), including microfluidic organ&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip (OoC), are breakthrough technologies in biomedicine. These systems recapitulate features of human tissues&#160;outside of the body. They are increasingly being used to study the functionality of different organs for applications such as drug evolutions, disease modeling, and precision medicine. Currently, developers and endpoint users of these in vitro&#160;models promote how they can replace animal models or even be a better ethically neutral and humanized alternative to study pathology, physiology, and pharmacology. Although reported models show a remarkable physiological structure and function compared to the conventional two&#8208;dimensional cell culture, they are almost exclusively based on standard passive polymers or glass with none or minimal real&#8208;time stimuli and readout capacity. The next technology leap in reproducing in vivo&#8208;like functionality and real&#8208;time monitoring of tissue function could be realized with advanced functional materials and devices. This review describes the currently reported electronic and optical advanced materials for sensing and stimulation of MPS models. In addition, we give an overview of multi&#8208;sensing for Body&#8208;on&#8208;Chip platforms. Finally, we give our perspective on how advanced functional materials could be integrated into in vitro systems to precisely mimic human physiology.

         <title>Fermi Level Pinning Dependent 2D Semiconductor Devices: Challenges and Prospects</title>

Abstract
Motivated by the high expectation for efficient electrostatic modulation of charge transport at very low voltages, atomically thin two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials with a range of band gaps have been investigated extensively for use in future semiconductor devices. However, researchers face formidable challenges in 2D device processing mainly originated from the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane van der Waals (vdW) structure of ultrathin 2D materials. As major challenges, untunable Schottky barrier height (SBH) and corresponding strong Fermi level pinning (FLP) at metal interfaces are observed unexpectedly with 2D vdW materials, giving rise to unmodulated semiconductor polarity, high contact resistance, and lowered device mobility. In this review, we addressed FLP observed from recently developed 2D semiconductor devices different from those observed from conventional semiconductor devices. It is understood that the observed FLP is attributed to inefficient doping into 2D materials, vdW gap present at the metal interface, and hybridized compounds formed under contacting metals. To provide readers with practical guidelines for the design of 2D devices, we further reviewed the impact of FLP occurring in 2D semiconductor devices by exploring various origins responsible for the FLP, effects of FLP on 2D device performances, and methods for improving metallic contact to 2D materials.

         <title>Boosting Cancer Immunotherapy Via the Convenient A2AR Inhibition Using a Tunable Nanocatalyst with light&#8208;enhanced Activity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Blockade of A2A adenosine receptors (A2AR)&#8208;adenosinergic signaling shows high potency to mobilize antitumor immunity for its in&#8208;depth involvement in immune regulation of nearly all immune cells. Available A2AR inhibition strategies are mainly based on small molecules or proteins inhibitors, yet are limited by the non&#8208;specific operation as well as the off&#8208;target toxicity. Herein, we report on the first effort to design a convenient tumor&#8208;specific A2AR inhibition strategy to improve antitumor immune responses via the spatiotemporally controlled oxygen supply by virtue of a versatile photo&#8208;modulated nanoreactor. This nanoreactor, consisting of a catalase&#8208;mimicking shell (Pt nanocatalyst) and a photothermal core (polydopamine), was rationally designed for achieving the near&#8208;infrared radiation (NIR)&#8208;guided/accelerated oxygen supplementation on tumor site, and for relieving the A2AR&#8208;mediated immunosuppression without toxicity concern. Meanwhile, the NIR light could also mediate the direct photothermal ablation of tumor, and elicit immunogenic cell deaths to boost antitumor immunity. In a poorly immunogenic breast cancer model, the intravenous injection of our nanoreactor led to the improved immune response with an increased animal survival rate, and achieved the long&#8208;term immunological memory effect against tumor recurrence as well as rechallenge. This convenient nanoreactor&#8208;stimulated A2AR inhibition approach provides a versatile promising paradigm for improving these existing immunotherapies.

Available A2AR inhibition strategies are mainly based on small molecules or proteins inhibitors, yet are limited by the non-specific operation as well as the off-target toxicity. Herein, we report on the first effort to design a convenient tumor-specific A2AR inhibition strategy to improve antitumor immune responses via the spatiotemporally controlled oxygen supply by virtue of a versatile photo-modulated nanoreactor. This nanoreactor, consisting of a catalase-mimicking shell (Pt nanocatalyst) and a photothermal core (polydopamine), was rationally designed for achieving the near-infrared radiation (NIR)-guided/accelerated oxygen supplementation on tumor site, and for relieving the A2AR-mediated immunosuppression without toxicity concern. Meanwhile, the NIR light could also mediate the direct photothermal ablation of tumor, and elicit immunogenic cell deaths to boost antitumor immunity. In a poorly immunogenic breast cancer model, the intravenous injection of our nanoreactor led to the improved immune response with an increased animal survival rate, and achieved the long-term immunological memory effect against tumor recurrence as well as rechallenge. This convenient nanoreactor-stimulated A2AR inhibition approach provides a versatile promising paradigm for improving these existing immunotherapies.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Manipulating Exchange Bias in a van der Waals Ferromagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Spintronic applications of thin film magnets require control and design of specific magnetic properties. Exchange bias, originating from the pinning of spins in a ferromagnet by these of an antiferromagnet, is a part of highly important elements for spintronics applications. Here, we&#160;report exchange bias of &#8764; 90 mT in a van der Waals ferromagnet encapsulated by two antiferromagnets at 5 K, the value of which is highly tunable by the field coolings. The non&#8208;antisymmetric dependence of exchange bias on field cooling is explained through considering an uncompensated interfacial magnetic layer of an antiferromagnet with a non&#8208;collinear spin texture, and a weak antiferromagnetic order in oxidized layer, at two ferromagnet/antiferromagnet interfaces. This work opens up new routes towards designing and controlling 2D spintronic devices made of atomically thin van der Waals magnets.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Regulation of Hydrogel Actuators by Autocatalytic Reaction Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Regulating hydrogel actuators with chemical reaction networks is instrumental for constructing life&#8208;inspired smart materials. Herein we engineered hydrogel actuators that are regulated by the autocatalytic front of thiols. The actuators consist of two layers. The first layer, which is regular polyacrylamide hydrogel, is in a strained conformation. The second layer, which is polyacrylamide hydrogel with disulfide crosslinks, maintains strain in the first layer. When thiols released by the autocatalytic front reduce disulfide crosslinks, the hydrogel actuates by releasing the mechanical strain in the first layer. The autocatalytic front is sustained by the reaction network, which uses thiouronium salts, disulfides of &#946;&#8208;aminothiols, and maleimide as starting components. The gradual actuation by the autocatalytic front enables movements such as gradual unrolling, screwing, and sequential closing of &#8220;fingers&#8221;. This actuation also allows the transmission of chemical signals in a relay fashion and the conversion of a chemical signal to an electrical signal. Locations and times of spontaneous initiation of autocatalytic fronts can be preprogrammed in the spatial distribution of the reactants in the hydrogel. To approach the functionality of living matter, the actuators triggered by an autocatalytic front can be integrated into smart materials regulated by chemical circuits.

         <title>Combating complement's deleterious effects on nanomedicine by conjugating complement regulatory proteins to nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Complement opsonization is among the biggest challenges facing nanomedicine. Nearly instantly after injection into blood, nanoparticles are opsonized by the complement protein C3, leading to clearance by phagocytes, fouling of targeting moieties, and release of anaphylatoxins. While surface polymers such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) partially decrease complement opsonization, most nanoparticles still suffer from extensive complement opsonization, especially when linked to targeting moieties. To ameliorate the deleterious effects of complement, we have conjugated two of mammals&#8217; natural regulators of complement activation (RCAs), Factors H &amp; I, to the surface of nanoparticles. In vitro, Factor H or I conjugation to PEG&#8208;coated nanoparticles decrease their C3 opsonization, and markedly reduce nanoparticle uptake by phagocytes. In an in vivo mouse model of sepsis&#8208;induced lung injury, Factor I&#8208;conjugation abrogates nanoparticle uptake by intravascular phagocytes in the lungs, allowing the blood concentration of the nanoparticle to remain elevated much longer. For nanoparticles targeted to the lung's endothelium by conjugation to anti&#8208;ICAM antibodies, Factor I&#8208;conjugation shifts the cell type distribution away from phagocytes and towards endothelial cells. Finally, Factor I&#8208;conjugation abrogates the severe anaphylactoid responses common to many nanoparticles, preventing systemic capillary leak and preserving blood flow to visceral organs and the brain. Thus, conjugation of RCAs, like Factor I, to nanoparticles is likely to help in nanomedicine's long battle against complement, improving several key parameters critical for clinical success.

         <title>Fluorination Enhanced Surface Stability of Disordered Rocksalt Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cation&#8208;disordered rocksalt (DRX) oxides are a promising new class of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathode materials for next&#8208;generation Li&#8208;ion batteries. However, their capacity fade during cycling presents a major challenge. Partial fluorine (F) substitution into oxygen (O) lattice appears to be an effective strategy for improving the cycling stability, but the underlying atomistic mechanism remains elusive. Here, using a combination of advanced transmission electron microscopy&#8208;based imaging and spectroscopy techniques, we probe the structural and chemical evolutions upon cycling of Mn&#8208;based DRX cathodes with an increasing F content (Li&#8208;Mn&#8208;Nb&#8208;O&#8208;Fx, x = 0, 0.05, 0.2). We reveal atomic origin behind the beneficial effect of high&#8208;level fluorination for enhancing surface stability of DRX. We discover that, due to the reduced O redox activity while with increasing F concentration, F in the DRX lattice mitigates the formation of O deficient surface layer upon cycling. For low F&#8208;substituted DRX, the O loss near the surface results in the formation of an amorphous cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase layer and nanoscale voids after extended cycling. Increased F concentration in DRX lattice minimizes both O loss and the interfacial reactions between DRX and liquid electrolyte, enhancing surface stability of DRX. Our results provide guidance on development of next&#8208;generation cathode materials through anion substitution.

Abstract
On&#8208;chip integration of solution&#8208;processable materials imposes stringent and simultaneous requirements of controlled nucleation and growth, tunable geometry and dimensions, and long&#8208;range&#8208;ordered assembly, which is challenging in solution process far from thermodynamic equilibrium. Superwetting interfaces, underpinned by programmable surface chemistry and topography, are promising for steering transport, dewetting and microfluid dynamics of liquids, thus opening a new paradigm for micro&#8208;/nanostructure assembly in solution process. Herein, assembly methods on the basis of superwetting interfaces are reviewed for constructing long&#8208;range&#8208;ordered micro&#8208;/nanostructures. Confined capillary liquids, including capillary bridges and capillary corner menisci realized by controlling local wettability and surface topography, are highlighted for simultaneously attained deterministic patterning and long&#8208;range order. The versatility and robustness of confined capillary liquids are discussed with assembly of single&#8208;crystalline micro&#8208;/nanostructures of organic semiconductors, metal&#8208;halide perovskites and colloidal&#8208;nanoparticle superlattices, which leads to enhanced device performances and exotic functionalities. Finally, we provide a perspective for promising directions in this realm.

&lt;p&gt;On-chip integration of solution-processable materials imposes stringent and simultaneous requirements of controlled nucleation and growth, tunable geometry and dimensions, and long-range-ordered assembly, which is challenging in solution process far from thermodynamic equilibrium. Superwetting interfaces, underpinned by programmable surface chemistry and topography, are promising for steering transport, dewetting and microfluid dynamics of liquids, thus opening a new paradigm for micro-/nanostructure assembly in solution process. Herein, assembly methods on the basis of superwetting interfaces are reviewed for constructing long-range-ordered micro-/nanostructures. Confined capillary liquids, including capillary bridges and capillary corner menisci realized by controlling local wettability and surface topography, are highlighted for simultaneously attained deterministic patterning and long-range order. The versatility and robustness of confined capillary liquids are discussed with assembly of single-crystalline micro-/nanostructures of organic semiconductors, metal-halide perovskites and colloidal-nanoparticle superlattices, which leads to enhanced device performances and exotic functionalities.

The inherent disadvantage of lead&#8208;free potassium sodium niobate (KNN)&#8208;based ceramics is the severe temperature instability of piezoelectric charge coefficient (d33) caused by the polymorphic phase boundary. Herein, a new concept of structural gradient is proposed by designing compositionally graded multilayer composites with multiple successive phase transitions, to solve the challenge of the inferior temperature stability. The structural gradient ceramics exhibit a superior temperature reliability (d33 remains almost unchanged in the temperature range of 25&#8764;100&#160;&#176;C), far outperforming the previously reported KNN counterparts with d33 variation above 27% over the same temperature range. The synergistic contribution of the continuous phase transition, the strain gradient, and the complementary effect of each constituent layer leads to the excellent temperature stability, which is also confirmed by phase&#8208;field simulation. These findings are expected to provide a new paradigm for functional material design with outstanding temperature stability.

Abstract
Current&#8208;induced control of magnetization in ferromagnets using spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT) has drawn attention as a new mechanism for fast and energy efficient magnetic memory devices. Energy&#8208;efficient spintronic devices require a spin&#8208;current source with a large SOT efficiency (&#958;) and electrical conductivity (&#963;), and an efficient spin injection across a transparent interface. Herein, we use single crystals of the van der Waals (vdW)&#160;topological semimetal WTe2&#160;and&#160;vdW ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2 to satisfy the requirements in their all&#8208;vdW&#8208;heterostructure with an atomically sharp interface. The results exhibit values of &#958; &#8776; 4.6 and &#963; &#8776; 2.25 &#215; 105 &#937;&#8211;1m&#8211;1 for WTe2. Moreover, we obtain the significantly reduced switching current density of 3.90 &#215; 106 A/cm2 at 150 K, which is an order of magnitude smaller than those of conventional heavy&#8208;metal/ferromagnet thin films. These findings highlight that engineering vdW&#8208;type&#160;topological materials and magnets&#160;offers a promising route to energy&#8208;efficient magnetization control in&#160;SOT&#8208;based spintronics.

         <title>Non&#8208;electrode Components for Rechargeable Aqueous Zinc Batteries: Electrolytes, Solid&#8208;Electrolyte&#8208;Interphase, Current Collectors, Binders, and Separators</title>

Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous zinc batteries (AZBs) are one of the promising options for large&#8208;scale electrical energy storage owing to their safety, affordability and environmental friendliness. During the past decade, there have been remarkable advancements in the AZBs technology, which were achieved through intensive efforts not only in the area of electrode materials but also in the fundamental understandings of non&#8208;electrode components such as electrolytes, solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), current collectors, binders, and separators. In particular, the breakthroughs in the non&#8208;electrode components should not be underestimated in having enabled the AZBs to attain a higher energy and power density beyond that of the conventional AZBs, proving their critical role. In this regard, the systematic overview of the current stages on the non&#8208;electrode external factors of AZBs would significantly benefit the community, where the focus has been primarily placed on electrode development so far. In this article, we comprehensively review the recent research progress with respect to non&#8208;electrode components in AZBs, covering the new&#8208;type of electrolytes that have been introduced, attempts for the tailoring of SEI, and the design efforts for multi&#8208;functional current collectors, binders and separators, along with the remaining challenges associated with these non&#8208;electrode components. Finally, we offer our perspectives towards future research directions in this field. This extensive overview on the non&#8208;electrode components is expected to guide and spur further development of high&#8208;performance AZBs.

         <title>Soluble Organic Cathodes Enable Long Cycle Life, High Rate, and Wide&#8208;Temperature Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Soluble organic cathodes are demonstrated with an ultra&#8208;long cycle life, excellent rate capability, and a wide operation temperature range from &#8722;70 to 100&#160;&#176;C based on bi&#8208;functional gel polymer electrolytes, which can eliminate the shuttling of the soluble organic electrode materials through molecular sieving and charge repulsion while maintaining a fast reaction kinetics.








Abstract
Organic electrode materials free of rare transition metal elements are promising for sustainable, cost&#8208;effective, and environmentally benign battery chemistries. However, severe shuttling effect caused by the dissolution of active materials in liquid electrolytes results in fast capacity decay, limiting their practical applications. Here, using a gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) that is in situ formed on Nafion&#8208;coated separators, the shuttle reaction of organic electrodes is eliminated while maintaining the electrochemical performance. The synergy of physical confinement by GPE with tunable polymer structure and charge repulsion of the Nafion&#8208;coated separator substantially prevents the soluble organic electrode materials with different molecular sizes from shuttling. A soluble small&#8208;molecule organic electrode material of 1,3,5&#8208;tri(9,10&#8208;anthraquinonyl)benzene demonstrates exceptional electrochemical performance with an ultra&#8208;long cycle life of 10&#8239;000 cycles, excellent rate capability of 203 mAh g&#8722;1 at 100 C, and a wide working temperature range from &#8722;70 to 100&#160;&#176;C based on the solid&#8211;liquid conversion chemistry, which outperforms all previously reported organic cathode materials. The shielding capability of GPE can be designed and tailored toward organic electrodes with different molecular sizes, thus providing a universal resolution to the shuttling effect that all soluble electrode materials suffer.

         <title>Cell Sheet&#8208;Like Soft Nanoreactor Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3&#160;nm&#8208;thick soft polystyrene&#8208;encased nanoframe (PEN) reactor arrays are designed to confine and guide the inward crystallization of nanocrystals. Such cell&#8208;like soft nanoreactor sheets change the reaction kinetics and offer a general platform to synthesize a set of mono&#8208;, bi&#8208;, and trimetallic, and even semiconductor nanocrystals with tunable interior structures that are difficult to achieve using traditional bulk solution&#8208;based systems.








Abstract
Tissues, which consist of groups of closely packed cell arrays, are essentially sheet&#8208;like biosynthesis plants. In tissues, individual cells are discrete microreactors working under highly viscous and confined environments. Herein, soft polystyrene&#8208;encased nanoframe (PEN) reactor arrays, as analogous nanoscale &#8220;sheet&#8208;like chemosynthesis plants&#8221;, for the controlled synthesis of novel nanocrystals, are reported. Although the soft polystyrene (PS) is only 3&#160;nm thick, it is elastic, robust, and permeable to aqueous solutes, while significantly slowing down their diffusion. PEN&#8208;associated palladium (Pd) crystallization follows a diffusion&#8208;controlled zero&#8208;order kinetics rather than a reaction&#8208;controlled first&#8208;order kinetics in bulk solution. Each individual PEN reactor has a volume in the zeptoliter range, which offers a unique confined environment, enabling a directional inward crystallization, in contrast to the conventional outward nucleation/growth that occurs in an unconfined bulk solution. This strategy makes it possible to generate a set of mono&#8208;, bi&#8208;, and trimetallic, and even semiconductor nanocrystals with tunable interior structures, which are difficult to achieve with normal systems based on bulk solutions.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of the first three&#8208;component metal&#8208;free photon upconversion system on the upconversion efficiency and threshold light intensity is studied herein. While the efficiency is doubled, the threshold light intensity is also increased. The performance enhancement can be attributed to more efficient energy transfer from the sensitizer to the intermediate acceptor in combination with a high quantum yield emitter molecule.








Abstract
As in many fields, the most exciting endeavors in photon upconversion research focus on increasing the efficiency (upconversion quantum yield) and performance (anti&#8208;Stokes shift) while diminishing the cost of production. In this vein, studies employing metal&#8208;free thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) sensitizers have garnered increased interest. Here, for the first time, the strategy of ternary photon upconversion is utilized with the TADF sensitizer 2,4,5,6&#8208;tetrakis(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)isophthalonitrile (4CzIPN), resulting in a doubling of the upconversion quantum yield in comparison to the binary system employing p&#8208;terphenyl as the emitter. In this ternary blend, the sensitizer 4CzIPN is paired with an intermediate acceptor, 1&#8208;methylnaphthalene, in addition to the emitter molecule, p&#8208;terphenyl, yielding a normalized upconversion quantum yield of 7.6% while maintaining the 0.83&#160;eV anti&#8208;Stokes shift. These results illustrate the potential benefits of utilizing this strategy of energy&#8208;funneling, previously used only with heavy&#8208;metal based sensitizers, to increase the performance of these photon upconversion systems.

         <title>A Predictive Theory for Domain Walls in Oxide Ferroelectrics Based on Interatomic Interactions and its Implications for Collective Material Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A discrete microscopic Landau&#8211;Ginzburg&#8211;Devonshire (dmLGD) approach with A&#8208; and B&#8208;site cation displacements serving as order parameters is developed. Using dmLGD decomposition of the total energy of the system into the contributions of the individual cations, various properties are predicted for a wide range of ferroelectric perovskites based on the results obtained for BaTiO3, KNbO3, and PbTiO3 only.








Abstract
Domain walls separating regions of ferroelectric material with polarization oriented in different directions are crucial for applications of ferroelectrics. Rational design of ferroelectric materials requires the development of a theory describing how compositional and environmental changes affect domain walls. To model domain wall systems, a discrete microscopic Landau&#8211;Ginzburg&#8211;Devonshire (dmLGD) approach with A&#8208; and B&#8208;site cation displacements serving as order parameters is developed. Application of dmLGD to the classic BaTiO3, KNbO3, and PbTiO3 ferroelectrics shows that A&#8211;B cation repulsion is the key interaction that couples the polarization in neighboring unit cells of the material. dmLGD decomposition of the total energy of the system into the contributions of the individual cations and their interactions enables the prediction of different properties for a wide range of ferroelectric perovskites based on the results obtained for BaTiO3, KNbO3, and PbTiO3 only. It is found that the information necessary to estimate the structure and energy of domain&#8208;wall &#8220;defects&#8221; can be extracted from single&#8208;domain 5&#8208;atom first&#8208;principles calculations, and that &#8220;defect&#8208;like&#8221; domain walls offer a simple model system that sheds light on the relative stabilities of the ferroelectric, antiferroelectric, and paraelectric bulk phases. The dmLGD approach provides a general theoretical framework for understanding and designing ferroelectric perovskite oxides.

         <title>Multivalent Noncovalent Interfacing and Cross&#8208;Linking of Supramolecular Tubes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hierarchical synthetic supramolecular network is formed and interfaced to biomimetic surfaces using purely noncovalent interactions. Supramolecular synthetic copolymer bearing biotin linking group forms supramolecular networks upon addition of streptavidin, and can bind to streptavidin&#8208;modified surfaces. The architectures of these networks can be tuned by changing the biotin ratio in supramolecular copolymer and the concentration of streptavidin.








Abstract
Natural supramolecular filaments have the ability to cross&#8208;link with each other and to interface with the cellular membrane via biomolecular noncovalent interactions. This behavior allows them to form complex networks within as well as outside the cell, i.e., the cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix, respectively. The potential of artificial supramolecular polymers to interact through specific noncovalent interactions has so far only seen limited exploration due to the dynamic nature of supramolecular interactions. Here, a system of synthetic supramolecular tubes that cross&#8208;link forming supramolecular networks, and at the same time bind to biomimetic surfaces by the aid of noncovalent streptavidin&#8211;biotin linkages, is demonstrated. The architecture of the networks can be engineered by controlling the density of the biotin moiety at the exterior of the tubes as well as by the concentration of the streptavidin. The presented strategy provides a pathway for designing adjustable artificial supramolecular superstructures, which can potentially yield more complex biomimetic adaptive materials.

         <title>Free&#8208;Standing Nanofilm Electrode Arrays for Long&#8208;Term Stable Neural Interfacings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanofilm electrode arrays (NEAs) that consist of high&#8208;density, free&#8208;standing gold nanofilm electrodes are developed. The NEAs are encapsulated into biodissolvable polymer carriers through an efficient elastocapillary self&#8208;assembly process, enabling their reliable implantation into deep brain tissues. Chronically implanted NEAs can form intimate and innervated interfaces with neural tissue, enabling stable neuronal activity recordings across multiple brain regions over several months.








Abstract
Flexible neural electrodes integrated on micrometer&#8208;thick polymer substrates offer important opportunities for improving the stability of neuronal activity recordings during cognitive processes. However, the bending stiffness of micrometer&#8208;thick polymer substrates is typically two orders of magnitude higher than that of nanofilm electrodes, making it a limiting factor in electrode&#8208;tissue interfacings. Here, this limitation is overcome by developing self&#8208;assembled nanofilm electrode arrays (NEAs) that consist of high&#8208;density, free&#8208;standing gold nanofilm electrodes. Chronically implanted NEAs can form intimate and innervated interfaces with neural tissue, enabling stable neuronal activity recordings across multiple brain regions over several months. As an application example, the activities of the same neuronal populations are tracked across odor discrimination reversal learning and it is illustrated how dorsal striatal neurons represent and update stimulus&#8208;outcome associations across multiple timescales. The results underscore the potential of free&#8208;standing nanoscale materials for interfacing biological systems over long terms.

         <title>A Super&#8208;Boosted Hybrid Plasmonic Upconversion Process for Photodetection at 1550&#160;nm Wavelength</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A super&#8208;boosted hybrid plasmonic upconversion (UC) architecture comprising a hierarchical plasmonic upconversion (HPU) film and a polymeric microlens array (MLA) film is proposed for efficient photodetection at a wavelength of 1550&#160;nm. Significant UC emission enhancement is realized via the amplified plasmonic coupling of an HPU film. The plasmonic effect, super&#8208;boosted by microfocusing the incident light, by MLA leads to superior sensitivity and responsivity of devices at weak near&#8208;infrared excitation powers.








Abstract
A super&#8208;boosted hybrid plasmonic upconversion (UC) architecture comprising a hierarchical plasmonic upconversion (HPU) film and a polymeric microlens array (MLA) film is proposed for efficient photodetection at a wavelength of 1550&#160;nm. Plasmonic metasurfaces and Au core&#8211;satellite nanoassembly (CSNA) films can strongly induce a more effective plasmonic effect by providing numerous hot spots in an intense local electromagnetic field up to wavelengths exceeding 1550&#160;nm. Hence, significant UC emission enhancement is realized via the amplified plasmonic coupling of an HPU film comprising an Au CSNA and UC nanoparticles. Furthermore, an MLA polymer film is synergistically coupled with the HPU film, thereby focusing the incident near&#8208;infrared light in the micrometer region, including the plasmonic nanostructure area. Consequently, the plasmonic effect super&#8208;boosted by microfocusing the incident light, significantly lowers the detectable power limit of a device, resulting in superior sensitivity and responsivity at weak excitation powers. Finally, a triple&#8208;cation perovskite&#8208;based photodetector coupled with the hybrid plasmonic UC film exhibits the excellent values of responsivity and detectivity of 9.80&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1 and 8.22&#160;&#215;&#160;1012 Jones at a weak power density of &#8776;0.03&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2, respectively, demonstrating that the device performance is enhanced by more than 104 magnitudes over a reference sample.

Finally, a triple-cation perovskite-based photodetector coupled with the hybrid plasmonic UC film exhibits the excellent values of responsivity and detectivity of 9.80&#160;A&#160;W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 8.22&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; Jones at a weak power density of &#8776;0.03&#160;mW&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively, demonstrating that the device performance is enhanced by more than 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; magnitudes over a reference sample.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Sustainable Development
To address the &#8220;white pollution&#8221; caused by non&#8208;recyclable waste plastics, it is required that eco&#8208;friendly strategies for plastic degradation be developed for sustainable development. In article number 2005192, Yongfu Sun, Yi Xie, and co&#8208;workers highlight solar&#8208;driven, enzyme&#8208;driven, and low&#8208;temperature&#8208;driven catalytic conversion of plastics into value&#8208;added carbonaceous fuels under mild conditions.

         <title>Activatable 19F MRI Nanoprobes for Visualization of Biological Targets in Living Subjects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 50, December 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
19F magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with activatable nanoprobes enables real&#8208;time, deep&#8208;tissue, and background&#8208;free imaging of cells and biomolecules in living subjects. Recent progress on activatable 19F MRI nanoprobes made from three major 19F&#8208;containing compounds as well as present challenges and potential opportunities are discussed, giving more insights into activatable probe design for this emerging and encouraging field.








Abstract
Visualization of biological targets such as crucial cells and biomolecules in living subjects is critical for the studies of important biological processes. Though 1H magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has demonstrated its power in offering detailed anatomical and pathological information, its capacity for in vivo tracking of biological targets is limited by the high biological background of 1H. 19F distinguishes itself from its competitors as an exceptional complement to 1H in MRI through its high sensitivity, low biological background, and broad chemical shift range. The specificity and sensitivity of 19F MRI can be further boosted with activatable nanoprobes. The advantages of 19F MRI with activatable nanoprobes enable in vivo detection and imaging at the cellular or even molecular level in deep tissues, rendering this technique appealing as a potential solution for visualization of biological targets in living subjects. Here, recent progress over the past decades on activatable 19F MRI nanoprobes made from three major 19F&#8208;containing compounds, as well as present challenges and potential opportunities, are summarized to provide a panoramic prospective for the people who are interested in this emerging and exciting field.

         <title>Electron Matters: Recent Advances in Passivation and Applications of Black Phosphorus</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 50, December 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Besides the 2D structure, the unique feature of black phosphorus (BP) is the lone&#8208;pair electrons on each P atom. The interaction between the lone&#8208;pair electrons of BP and the acceptor component can be utilized for passivation of BP and contributes toward BP&#8208;based applications, either indirectly or directly.








Abstract
2D materials have experienced rapid and explosive development in the past decades. Among them, black phosphorus (BP) is one of the most promising materials on account of its thickness&#8208;dependent bandgap, high charge&#8208;carrier mobility, in&#8208;plane anisotropic structure, and excellent biocompatibility, as well as the broad applications brought by the properties. In view of the electron configuration, the most unique feature of BP is the lone&#8208;pair electrons on each P atom. The lone&#8208;pair electrons inevitably cause high reactivity of BP, particularly toward water/oxygen, which greatly limits the practical application of BP under ambient conditions. The other side of the coin is that BP can serve as an electron donor to promote the construction of BP&#8208;based hybrid materials and/or to boost the performance of BP or BP&#8208;based hybrid materials in applications. Here, recent advances in passivation and application of BP by addressing the interaction between the lone&#8208;pair electrons of BP and the other materials are discussed, and prospects for future research on BP are also proposed.

         <title>Recent Advances in Inorganic Chiral Nanomaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 50, December 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imposing chirality onto inorganic nanomaterials is essentially required for developing prominent biomedical applications intrinsically associated with homochirality, as well as for advanced light polarization. Recent investigations in inorganic chiral nanomaterials are summarized, paving the way to fully understanding the important chiral effects and prospectively exploring diverse applications with enhanced functionalities.








Abstract
Inorganic nanoparticles offer a multifunctional platform for biomedical applications in drug delivery, biosensing, bioimaging, disease diagnosis, screening, and therapies. Homochirality prevalently exists in biological systems composed of asymmetric biochemical activities and processes, so biomedical applications essentially favor the usage of inorganic chiral nanomaterials, which have been widely studied in the past two decades. Here, the latest investigations are summarized including the characterization of 3D stereochirality, the bionic fabrication of hierarchical chirality, extension of the compositional space to poly&#8208;elements, studying optical activities with the (sub&#8208;)single&#8208;particle resolution, and the experimental demonstration in biomedical applications. These advanced studies pave the way toward fully understanding the two important chiral effects (i.e., the chiroptical and enantioselective effects), and prospectively promote the flexible design and fabrication of inorganic chiral nanoparticles with engineerable functionalities to solve diverse practical problems closely associated with environment and public health.

         <title>Thermally Stable Single&#8208;Atom Heterogeneous Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 50, December 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom heterogeneous catalysts have attracted extensive interest recently, especially for material synthesis and catalytic performance. Their thermal stability under reaction conditions is closely related to the application of these materials in industry in the future. Recent progress in developing thermally stable single&#8208;atom catalysts, including preparation strategies, coordination structure of single atoms, and catalytic performance, is summarized.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted extensive attention in fields related to energy, environment, and material sciences because of the high atom efficiency and the unique properties of these materials. Many approaches have hitherto been successfully established to prepare SACs, including impregnation, pyrolysis&#8208;involved processes, atom trapping, and coprecipitation. However, under typical reaction conditions, single atoms on catalysts tend to migrate or agglomerate, forming nanoclusters or nanoparticles, which lowers their surface free energy. Efforts are required to develop strategies for improving the thermal stability of SACs while achieving excellent catalytic performance. In this Progress Report, recent advances in the development of thermally durable single&#8208;atom heterogeneous catalysts are discussed. Several important preparation approaches for thermally stable SACs are described in this article. Fundamental understanding of the coordination structures of thermally stable single atom prepared by these methods is discussed. Furthermore, the catalytic performances of these thermally stable SACs are reviewed, including their activity and stability. Finally, a perspective of this important and rapidly evolving research field is provided.

The highly localized and strong electromagnetic fields generated by plasmonic nanomaterials, when excited by incident lasers with suitable wavelengths, can greatly boost the excitation and/or radiation processes of various spectroscopies, including Raman, fluorescence, or nonlinear spectroscopies, giving enhanced signals and improved spectral sensitivity.








Abstract
Plasmonic core&#8211;shell nanostructures have attracted considerable attention in the scientific community recently due to their highly tunable optical properties. Plasmon&#8208;enhanced spectroscopies are one of the main applications of plasmonic nanomaterials. When excited by an incident laser of suitable wavelength, strong and highly localized electromagnetic (EM) fields are generated around plasmonic nanomaterials, which can significantly boost excitation and/or radiation processes that amplify Raman, fluorescence, or nonlinear signals and improve spectroscopic sensitivity. Herein, recent developments in plasmon&#8208;enhanced spectroscopies utilizing core&#8211;shell nanostructures are reviewed, including shell&#8208;isolated nanoparticle&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SHINERS), plasmon&#8208;enhanced fluorescence spectroscopy, and plasmon&#8208;enhanced nonlinear spectroscopy.

Abstract
Single&#8208;molecule electrochemical transistors are a type of novel molecular devices in which the tunneling current through the single&#8208;molecule junction is modulated by the electrochemical gate, and is considered a promising candidate to be employed in molecular integrated circuits for building the future &#8220;molecular computers.&#8221; Benefiting from the particular interfacial electrical double layer, the current modulation process can be realized through direct orbital gating as well as electrochemical electron transfer driven by electrode potential, thus significantly enriching the functions of the transistor devices.

         <title>Chemical Insights into Interfacial Effects in Inorganic Nanomaterials</title>

The interfaces between inorganic functional nanomaterials and their surface modifiers play important roles in determining their chemical and physical properties. Strategies toward the fabrication of model inorganic nanomaterials with well&#8208;defined and detectable interfaces for deep understanding of complicated interfacial effects at the molecular level are highlighted.








Abstract
The interfaces between inorganic functional nanomaterials and their surface modifiers play important roles in determining their chemical and physical properties. In numerous situations, interfaces created by organic ligands or secondary inorganic components on inorganic nanomaterials induce significant effects to promote their performances. However, it still remains challenging to understand those interfacial effects at the molecular level. Herein, strategies via the design of model inorganic nanomaterials with well&#8208;defined and detectable interfaces to simplify the investigation of interfacial effects in inorganic nanomaterials are summarized. While atomically precise metal nanoclusters enable &#8220;seeing&#8221; how organic ligands are coordinated on metal surface to create nanoscale metal&#8211;organic interfaces, ultrathin low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials modified with organic ligands make it possible to extract the metal&#8211;organic interface structure from the average signal to investigate how steric and electronic effects enhance catalysis. The molecular mechanisms of the interfacial effects in supported metal catalysts are disclosed by designing two unique structures of supported catalysts. The interfacial engineering approach will be further extended to optimize the performance and stability of perovskite solar cells. Finally, a perspective on the development of operando characterization techniques is provided to track the dynamic interfacial structures during catalysis.

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Based Adaptive Structural Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 50, December 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid&#8208;based adaptive structural materials have been demonstrated to possess both dynamic adaptivity (from the active liquid part) and stable mechanical structure (from the fixed solid part). The recent progress in the development of liquid&#8208;based adaptive structural materials, including liquid with particles, liquid with surfaces, and liquid with membranes, along with their structure&#8211;function relationship and applications is summarized.








Abstract
Structural materials are used to provide stable mechanical architectures and transmit or support forces, and they play an important role in materials science and technology. During the long process of the exploitation of structural materials, the functionality of structural materials has gained prominence. Adaptive structures responding to external stimuli have come to the fore with significant advantages in structural materials. However, many solid adaptive structural materials still suffer from their single function and the lack of dynamic performance, such as issue around fouling and energy consumption, defects present everywhere in materials at the microscale, etc. To meet the increasing demands, more and more researchers have started turning their attention to liquid&#8208;based materials owing to their intrinsic spontaneous, dynamic, and functional properties. Liquid&#8208;based adaptive structural materials (LASMs) have been proposed and developed. Building upon both dynamic liquids and fixed solids, LASMs have been demonstrated to possess both dynamic adaptivity (from the active liquid part) and stable mechanical structure (from the fixed solid part), which are desired in many applications such as 3D printing, droplet manipulation, omniphobic surfaces, microfluidics, mass separation, etc. A unifying view of the recent progress of LASMs is presented, including liquid with particles, liquid with surfaces, as well as liquid with membranes. In addition, the discussion of the prospects and challenges are provided for promoting the development of LASMs.

Abstract
The vast development of nanofabrication has spurred recent progress for the manipulation of light down to a region much smaller than the wavelength. Metallic plasmonic array structures are demonstrated to be the most powerful platform to realize controllable light&#8211;matter interactions and have found wide applications due to their rich and tunable optical performance through the morphology and parameter engineering. Here, various light&#8208;management mechanisms that may exist on metallic plasmonic array structures are described. Then, the typical techniques for fabrication of metallic plasmonic arrays are summarized. Next, some recent applications of plasmonic arrays are reviewed, including plasmonic sensing, surface&#8208;enhanced spectroscopies, plasmonic nanolasing, and perfect light absorption. Lastly, the existing challenges and perspectives for metallic plasmonic arrays are discussed. The aim is to provide guidance for future development of metallic plasmonic array structures.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 50, December 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in metal&#8208;sulfide&#8208;based photocatalytic valorization of lignocellulose are reviewed. Structures, roles, and functioning mechanisms of metal sulfides in biomass conversions are carefully analyzed. The unique properties of metal sulfides in catalyzing C&#63743;O&#8208;bond cleavage, selective oxidation, C&#63743;C coupling, and C&#63743;H activation under light irradiation are highlighted and discussed to inspire future breakthroughs.








Abstract
Transition metal sulfides are an extraordinarily vital class of semiconductors with a wide range of applications in the photocatalytic field. A great number of recent advances in photocatalytic transformations of lignocellulosic biomass, the largest renewable carbon resource, into high&#8208;quality fuels and value&#8208;added chemicals has been achieved over metal sulfide semiconductors. Herein, the progress and breakthroughs in metal&#8208;sulfide&#8208;based photocatalytic systems for lignocellulose valorization with an emphasis on selective depolymerization of lignin and oxidative coupling of some important bioplatforms are highligted. The key issues that control reaction pathways and mechanisms are carefully examined. The functions of metal sulfides in the elementary reactions, including C&#63743;O&#8208;bond cleavage, selective oxidations, C&#63743;C coupling, and C&#63743;H activation, are discussed to offer insights to guide the rational design of active and selective photocatalysts for sustainable chemistry. The prospects of sulfide photocatalysts in biomass valorization are also analyzed and briefly discussed.

         <title>Cell/Bacteria&#8208;Based Bioactive Materials for Cancer Immune Modulation and Precision Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 50, December 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cell/bacteria&#8208;based bioactive materials are summarized in terms of their structural components, engineered strategies, bioproperties, and functions. An overview of the biomedical applications of bioactive materials in tumor targeting delivery, immune modulation, and precise therapy is given, along with a series of successful case studies on tiny robots derived from cell/bacteria materials.








Abstract
Numerous clinical trials for cancer precision medicine research are limited due to the drug resistance, side effects, and low efficacy. Unsatisfactory outcomes are often caused by complex physiologic barriers and abnormal immune events in tumors, such as tumor target alterations and immunosuppression. Cell/bacteria&#8208;derived materials with unique bioactive properties have emerged as attractive tools for personalized therapy in cancer. Naturally derived bioactive materials, such as cell and bacterial therapeutic agents with native tropism or good biocompatibility, can precisely target tumors and effectively modulate immune microenvironments to inhibit tumors. Here, the recent advances in the development of cell/bacteria&#8208;based bioactive materials for immune modulation and&#160;precision therapy in cancer are summarized. Cell/bacterial constituents, including cell membranes, bacterial vesicles, and other active substances have inherited their unique targeting properties and antitumor capabilities. Strategies for engineering living cell/bacteria to overcome complex biological barriers and immunosuppression to promote antitumor efficacy are also summarized. Moreover, past and ongoing trials involving personalized bioactive materials and promising agents such as cell/bacteria&#8208;based micro/nano&#8208;biorobotics are further discussed, which may become another powerful tool for treatment in the near future.

         <title>Solid&#8208;State NMR and MRI Spectroscopy for Li/Na Batteries: Materials, Interface, and In Situ Characterization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 50, December 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The complex and coupled (electro) chemical processes complicate the investigation of the working and decay mechanisms of batteries. Solid&#8208;state NMR (ssNMR) and magnetic resonance imaging techniques exhibit unique capability in studying both the local environment and ionic dynamic issues in electrochemi cal energy materials and devices, including three key aspects: electrode/electrolyte materials, electrode/electrolyte interfaces, and in situ ssNMR.








Abstract
Enhancing the electrochemical performance of batteries, including the lifespan, energy, and power densities, is an everlasting quest for the rechargeable battery community. However, the dynamic and coupled (electro)chemical processes that occur in the electrode materials as well as at the electrode/electrolyte interfaces complicate the investigation of their working and decay mechanisms. Herein, the recent developments and applications of solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques in Li/Na batteries are reviewed. Several typical cases including the applications of NMR spectroscopy for the investigation of the pristine structure and the dynamic structural evolution of materials are first emphasized. The NMR applications in analyzing the solid electrolyte interfaces (SEI) on the electrode are further concluded, involving the identification of SEI components and investigation of ionic motion through the interfaces. Beyond, the new development of in situ NMR and MRI techniques are highlighted, including their advantages, challenges, applications and the design principle of in situ cell. In the end, a prospect about how to use ssNMR in battery research from the perspectives of materials, interface, and in situ NMR, aiming at obtaining deeper insight of batteries with the assistance of ssNMR is represented.

         <dc:description>
Magnetoelectricity plays a huge role in the development of next&#8208;generation devices. Since the discovery of multiferroic properties in inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid molecular materials, the related magnetoelectric behaviors have been gradually discovered and advanced at a vigorous pace. This brief development of multiferroicity/magnetoelectricity in inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid molecular materials shows their prospect for future development.

         <dc:description>
The acidic oxygen evolution reaction is the key to realizing the application of proton&#8208;exchange membrane water electrolyzers. The most recent advances in advanced electrocatalysts for enhancing the acidic oxygen evolution reaction, including Ir&#8208;based, Ru&#8208;based, nonprecious&#8208;metal&#8208;based, and carbon&#8208;based nanostructures, are comprehensively summarized. The strategies summarized are of benefit for more advanced electrocatalysts design.








Abstract
Proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolyzers hold great significance for renewable energy storage and conversion. The acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is one of the main roadblocks that hinder the practical application of PEM water electrolyzers. Highly active, cost&#8208;effective, and durable electrocatalysts are indispensable for lowering the high kinetic barrier of OER to achieve boosted reaction kinetics. To date, a wide spectrum of advanced electrocatalysts has been designed and synthesized for enhanced acidic OER performance, though Ir and Ru based nanostructures still represent the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts. In this Progress Report, recent research progress in advanced electrocatalysts for improved acidic OER performance is summarized. First, fundamental understanding about acidic OER including reaction mechanisms and atomic understanding to acidic OER for rational design of efficient electrocatalysts are discussed. Thereafter, an overview of the progress in the design and synthesis of advanced acidic OER electrocatalysts is provided in terms of catalyst category, i.e., metallic nanostructures (Ir and Ru based), precious metal oxides, nonprecious metal oxides, and carbon based nanomaterials. Finally, perspectives to the future development of acidic OER are provided from the aspects of reaction mechanism investigation and more efficient electrocatalyst design.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 50, December 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The links between the intrinsic charge&#8208;carrier behaviors of polyoxometalates (POMs) from a chemistry&#8208;oriented view are discussed and their recent ground&#8208;breaking developments in related areas, including molecular&#8208;level electronic devices, solar&#8208;driven, thermally driven, and electrochemically driven energy generation, conversion, and storage systems are  reviewed. Finally, present challenges and the fundamental insights for advanced design and self&#8208;assembly of POM building blocks are also discussed.








Abstract
Polyoxometalates (POMs) are a series of molecular metal oxide clusters, which span the two domains of solutes and solid metal oxides. The unique characters of POMs in structure, geometry, and adjustable redox properties have attracted widespread attention in functional material synthesis, catalysis, electronic devices, and electrochemical energy storage and conversion. This review is focused on the links between the intrinsic charge carrier behaviors of POMs from a chemistry&#8208;oriented view and their recent ground&#8208;breaking developments in related areas. First, the advantageous charge transfer behaviors of POMs in molecular&#8208;level electronic devices are summarized. Solar&#8208;driven, thermal&#8208;driven, and electrochemical&#8208;driven charge carrier behaviors of POMs in energy generation, conversion and storage systems are also discussed. Finally, present challenges and fundamental insights are discussed as to the advanced design of functional systems based upon POM building blocks for their possible emerging application areas.

         <title>New Silk Road: From Mesoscopic Reconstruction/Functionalization to Flexible Meso&#8208;Electronics/Photonics Based on Cocoon Silk Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 50, December 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Owing to the mesoscopic multi&#8208;levels of structures and the intermolecular nucleation control mechanism, a revolutionary materials strategy from mesoscopic reconstruction to the fabrication of new conceptual meso&#8208;electronic/photonic devices based on silk fibroin materials is presented. This development turns out to be very crucial in the field of flexible electronics, optics/photonics, and biomedical/healthcare, which leads to a New Silk Road in big health and the artificial intelligence era.








Abstract
Two of the key questions to be addressed are whether and how one can turn cocoon silk into fascinating materials with different electronic and optical functions so as to fabricate the flexible devices. In this review, a comprehensive overview of the unique strategy of mesoscopic functionalization starting from silk fibroin (SF) materials to the fabrication of various meso flexible SF devices is presented. Notably, SF materials with novel and enhanced properties can be achieved by mesoscopically reconstructing the hierarchical structures of SF materials. This is based on rerouting the refolding process of SF molecules by meso&#8208;nucleation templating. As&#8208;acquired functionalized SF materials can be applied to fabricate bio&#8208;compatible/degradable flexible/implantable meso&#8208;optical/electronic devices of various types. Consequently, functionalized SF can be fabricated into optical elements, that is, nonlinear photonic and fluorescent components, and make it possible to construct silk meso&#8208;electronics with high&#8208;performance. These advances enable the applications of SF&#8208;material based devices in the areas of physical and biochemical sensing, meso&#8208;memristors, transistors, brain electrodes, and energy generation/storage, applicable to on&#8208;skin long&#8208;term monitoring of human physiological conditions, and in&#8208;body sensing, information processing, and storage.

         <title>Conversion of Waste Plastics into Value&#8208;Added Carbonaceous Fuels under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 50, December 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several strategies including solar&#8208;driven conversion, enzyme&#8208;driven conversion, and low&#8208;temperature&#8208;driven catalytic conversion are developed for converting non&#8208;recyclable plastic wastes into value&#8208;added fuels under mild conditions.








Abstract
Owing to the extremely difficult breakage of the adamant cross&#8208;linked structures, converting non&#8208;recyclable plastic wastes into valuable fuels usually demands rigorous conditions, wherein the required high temperature and pressure is inevitably energy&#8208;wasting and environment&#8208;polluting. Given this aspect, herein, the recent achievements in the conversion of plastics into value&#8208;added carbonaceous fuels under mild conditions are summarized. In detail, solar&#8208;driven conversion of commercial plastics into liquid fuels in alkaline solutions or pure water at ambient temperature and pressure are surveyed; also, enzyme&#8208;driven conversion of polyethylene terephthalate into terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol at a mild temperature are emphasized; and low&#8208;temperature&#8208;driven catalytic conversion of polyethylene into oils and waxes with the help of a light alkane are reviewed. Finally, other potentially used strategies and in situ characterization technologies in plastics degradation under moderate conditions are presented.

         <title>Mechanoluminescence Rebrightening the Prospects of Stress Sensing: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 50, December 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanoluminescence&#8208;based stress sensing exhibits many advantages, including remoteness, spatial distribution, stretchability, biocompatibility, and self&#8208;powering. With great potential in wearable device, biomechanics, and engineering structure diagnosis applications, it is reasonable to believe that mechanoluminescence&#8208;based stress sensing may rebrighten the prospects of stress sensing.








Abstract
The emergence of new applications, such as in artificial intelligence, the internet of things, and biotechnology, has driven the evolution of stress sensing technology. For these emerging applications, stretchability, remoteness, stress distribution, a multimodal nature, and biocompatibility are important performance characteristics of stress sensors. Mechanoluminescence (ML)&#8208;based stress sensing has attracted widespread attention because of its characteristics of remoteness and having a distributed response to mechanical stimuli as well as its great potential for stretchability, biocompatibility, and self&#8208;powering. In the past few decades, great progress has been made in the discovery of ML materials, analysis of mechanisms, design of devices, and exploration of applications. One can find that with this progress, the focus of ML research has shifted from the phenomenon in the earliest stage to materials and recently toward devices. At the present stage, while showing great prospects for advanced stress sensing applications, ML&#8208;based sensing still faces major challenges in material optimization, device design, and system integration.

Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries have a high specific energy capacity and density of 1675 mAh g&#8722;1 and 2670&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, respectively, rendering them among the most promising successors for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, there are myriads of obstacles in the practical application and commercialization of Li&#8208;S batteries, including the low conductivity of sulfur and its discharge products (Li2S/Li2S2), volume expansion of sulfur electrode, and the polysulfide shuttle effect. Hence, immense attention has been devoted to rectifying these issues, of which the application of metal&#8208;based compounds (i.e., transition metal, metal phosphides, sulfides, oxides, carbides, nitrides, phosphosulfides, MXenes, hydroxides, and metal&#8208;organic frameworks) as sulfur hosts is profiled as a fascinating strategy to hinder the polysulfide shuttle effect stemming from the polar&#8211;polar interactions between the metal compounds and polysulfides. This review encompasses the fundamental electrochemical principles of Li&#8208;S batteries and insights into the interactions between the metal&#8208;based compounds and the polysulfides, with emphasis on the intimate structure&#8211;activity relationship corroborated with theoretical calculations. Additionally, the integration of conductive carbon&#8208;based materials to ameliorate the existing adsorptive abilities of the metal&#8208;based compound is systematically discussed. Lastly, the challenges and prospects toward the smart design of catalysts for the future development of practical Li&#8208;S batteries are presented.

Metal halide perovskite nanocrystal (PNC)/polymer nanocomposites that combine the unique optoelectronic properties of PNCs and outstanding stability, flexibility, and processability enabled by polymers are an appealing class of material with many promising applications. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art synthetic strategies and intriguing properties of PNC/polymer nanocomposites, as well as their wide&#8208;ranging applications in light emision, sensing, and energy conversion areas are summarized.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) have recently garnered tremendous research interest due to their unique optoelectronic properties and promising applications in photovoltaics and optoelectronics. Metal halide PNCs can be combined with polymers to create nanocomposites that carry an array of advantageous characteristics. The polymer matrix can bestow stability, stretchability, and solution&#8208;processability while the PNCs maintain their size&#8208;, shape&#8208; and composition&#8208;dependent optoelectronic properties. As such, these nanocomposites possess great promise for next&#8208;generation displays, lighting, sensing, biomedical technologies, and energy conversion. The recent advances in metal halide PNC/polymer nanocomposites are summarized here. First, a variety of synthetic strategies for crafting PNC/polymer nanocomposites are discussed. Second, their array of intriguing properties is examined. Third, the broad range of applications of PNC/polymer nanocomposites is highlighted, including light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), lasers, and scintillators. Finally, an outlook on future research directions and challenges in this rapidly evolving field are presented.

         <title>Emerging Materials and Methods toward Ammonia&#8208;Based Energy Storage and Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 50, December 16, 2021. </description>

The application of ammonia for energy storage and conversion raises demands for the improvement of existing technologies and development of new methods and materials. The recent advances of materials and methods toward ammonia synthesis, storage or separation, and utilization are presented. Key scientific challenges and perspectives are provided to stimulate further studies enabling ammonia&#8208;based sustainable energy supply in the future.








Abstract
Efficient storage and conversion of renewable energies is of critical importance to the sustainable growth of human society. With its distinguishing features of high hydrogen content, high energy density, facile storage/transportation, and zero&#8208;carbon emission, ammonia has been recently considered as a promising energy carrier for long&#8208;term and large&#8208;scale energy storage. Under this scenario, the synthesis, storage, and utilization of ammonia are key components for the implementation of ammonia&#8208;mediated energy system. Being different from fossil fuels, renewable energies normally have intermittent and variable nature, and thus pose demands on the improvement of existing technologies and simultaneously the development of alternative methods and materials for ammonia synthesis and storage. The energy release from ammonia in an efficient manner, on the other hand, is vital to achieve a sustainable energy supply and complete the nitrogen circle. Herein, recent advances in the thermal&#8208;, electro&#8208;, plasma&#8208;, and photocatalytic ammonia synthesis, ammonia storage or separation, ammonia thermal/electrochemical decomposition and conversion are summarized with the emphasis on the latest developments of new methods and materials (catalysts, electrodes, and sorbents) for these processes. The challenges and potential solutions are discussed.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 50, December 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wide&#8208;bandgap oxide semiconductors uniquely combine electrical conductivity and optical transparency and are widely used in optoelectronic devices. The  materials physics of wide&#8208;bandgap oxide semiconductors, the recent progress in the design of new materials and novel thin&#8208;film transistor (TFT) devices, and current challenges and perspectives are reviewed.








Abstract
Wide bandgap oxide semiconductors constitute a unique class of materials that combine properties of electrical conductivity and optical transparency. They are being widely used as key materials in optoelectronic device applications, including flat&#8208;panel displays, solar cells, OLED, and emerging flexible and transparent electronics. In this article, an up&#8208;to&#8208;date review on both the fundamental understanding of materials physics of oxide semiconductors, and recent research progress on design of new materials and high&#8208;performing thin film transistor (TFT) devices in the context of fundamental understanding is presented. In particular, an in depth overview is first provided on current understanding of the electronic structures, defect and doping chemistry, optical and transport properties of oxide semiconductors, which provide essential guiding principles for new material design and device optimization. With these principles, recent advances in design of p&#8208;type oxide semiconductors, new approaches for achieving cost&#8208;effective transparent (flexible) electrodes, and the creation of high mobility 2D electron gas (2DEG) at oxide surfaces and interfaces with a wealth of fascinating physical properties of great potential for novel device design are then reviewed. Finally, recent progress and perspective of oxide TFT based on new oxide semiconductors, 2DEG, and low&#8208;temperature solution processed oxide semiconductor for flexible electronics will be reviewed.

         <title>Excited State Energy Transfer in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 50, December 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Excited&#8208;state energy transfer in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) plays an important role in using these materials for photocatalysis, fluorescence sensing, and emission. Study of the energy transfer mechanism helps to design efficient and directional energy transfer paths in MOFs to meet the needs of artificial photosynthesis, high&#8208;performance chemical sensors, and novel exciton&#8208;based devices.








Abstract
Excited state energy transfer in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) is of great interest due to potential application of these materials in photocatalysis and fluorescence sensing. In photocatalysis, a light&#8208;harvesting antenna of MOFs can collect energy from a much larger area than a single reaction center and efficiently transport the energy to the active site to enhance photocatalytic efficiency, mimicking nature photosynthesis. In fluorescence sensing, excited state traveling on the framework can search for analyte quencher molecules to give amplified fluorescence quenching, so that one quencher turns off multiple excited states to enhance signal. Key to these designer performances is highly efficient energy transfer on these framework materials that are determined by types of excited states, dimension of the materials, and structure of the frameworks. Advancement of MOF synthetic chemistry provides new tools to control the rate and directionality of energy transfer in these materials, opening opportunities in manipulating excited states at an unprecedented level.

         <title>Challenges and Recent Advances in High Capacity Li&#8208;Rich Cathode Materials for High Energy Density Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 50, December 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The practical applications of Li&#8208;rich cathode materials, especially Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based (LRM) cathodes, are hindered by their inherent shortcomings. In this case, the recent understanding of complex reaction mechanisms, the novel modification methods, and the corresponding development trends are comprehensively reviewed. Additionally, other branches and the future opportunities of the Li&#8208;rich cathode materials are also summarized.








Abstract
Li&#8208;rich cathode materials have attracted increasing attention because of their high reversible discharge capacity (&gt;250&#160;mA h g&#8722;1), which originates from transition metal (TM) ion redox reactions and unconventional oxygen anion redox reactions. However, many issues need to be addressed before their practical applications, such as their low kinetic properties and inefficient voltage fading. The development of cutting&#8208;edge technologies has led to cognitive advances in theory and offer potential solutions to these problems. Herein, a recent in&#8208;depth understanding of the mechanisms and the frontier electrochemical research progress of Li&#8208;rich cathodes are reviewed. In addition, recent advances associated with various strategies to promote the performance and the development of modification methods are discussed. In particular, excluding Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based (LRM) cathodes, other branches of the Li&#8208;rich cathode materials are also summarized. The consistent pursuit is to obtain energy storage devices with high capacity, reliable practicability, and absolute safety. The recent literature and ongoing efforts in this area are also described, which will create more opportunities and new ideas for the future development of Li&#8208;rich cathode materials.

         <title>Immune Checkpoint Ligand Bioengineered Schwann Cells as Antigen&#8208;Specific Therapy for Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A translational method for bioengineering programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 and cluster of differentiation 86&#8208;functionalized Schwann cells to prevent and ameliorate multiple sclerosis is developed.








Abstract
Failure to establish immune tolerance leads to the development of autoimmune disease. The ability to regulate autoreactive T cells without inducing systemic immunosuppression represents a major challenge in the development of new strategies to treat autoimmune disease. Here, a translational method for bioengineering programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1)&#8208; and cluster of differentiation 86 (CD86)&#8208;functionalized mouse Schwann cells (SCs) to prevent and ameliorate multiple sclerosis (MS) in established mouse models of chronic and relapsing&#8208;remitting experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is described. It is shown that the intravenous (i.v.) administration of immune checkpoint ligand functionalized mouse SCs modifies the course of disease and ameliorates EAE. Further, it is found that such bioengineered mouse SCs inhibit the differentiation of myelin&#8208;specific helper T cells into pathogenic T helper type&#8208;1 (Th1) and type&#8208;17 (Th17) cells, promote the development of tolerogenic myelin&#8208;specific regulatory T (Treg) cells, and resolve inflammatory central nervous system microenvironments without inducing systemic immunosuppression.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Assisted 4D Programming and Reprogramming of Liquid Crystalline Organogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An entropic approach is reported to program and reprogram the molecular ordering in liquid crystalline organogels via directed solvent evaporation. A wide variety of active origami/kirigami structures and 4D shape morphing of 3D printed LCNs with unattainable spatial and temporal control can be readily reached without meticulous alignment during network formation.








Abstract
Encoding molecular ordering during liquid crystalline network (LCN) formation endows preprogrammed but fixed shape morphing in response to external stimuli. The incorporation of dynamic covalent bonds enables shape reprogramming but also permanently alters the network structures. Here, an entropic approach that can program complex shapes via directed solvent evaporation from an isotropic LCN organogel is discoursed. Different shapes can be erased and reprogrammed from the same LCN on demand depending on the modes of deformation of the organogel during solvent evaporation. The ability to decouple network synthesis and molecular alignment relaxes the requirements to LCN chemistry and alignment methods, allowing for the realization of a variety of origami/kirigami structures and 4D shape morphing of LCNs printed from the digital light processing technique with unattainable spatial and temporal controls.

         <title>Endogenous Electric Fields&#8208;Coupled Electrospun Short Fiber Via Collecting Wound Exudation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Endogenous electric fields (EF) are the basis of bioelectric signal conduction and the priority signal for damaged tissue regeneration. Tissue exudation directly affects the characteristics of endogenous EF. However, current biomaterials lead to passive repair of defect tissue due to limited management of early wound exudates and inability to actively respond to coupled endogenous EF. Herein, the 3D bionic short&#8208;fiber scaffold with the functions of early biofluid collection, response to coupled endogenous EF was constructed by guiding the short fibers into a 3D network structure using electrospinning, homogenization, crosslinking, and subsequent multifunctional modification. The scaffold exhibited rapid and reversible water absorption performance, reaching maximum after only 30 seconds. The stable and uniform distribution of polydopamine&#8208;reduced graphene oxide endowed the scaffold with stable electrical and mechanical performances even after undergoing long&#8208;term aqueous immersion. Due to its unique 3D bionic structure and tissue affinity, the scaffold further acted as an &#8220;electronic skin&#8221;, which transmitted endogenous bioelectrical signals via absorbing wound exudates, promoting the treatment of diabetic wounds. Furthermore, under the endogenous EF, the cascade release of vascular endothelial growth factor accelerated the healing process. Thus, the versatile scaffold is expected to be ideal candidates for repairing different defect tissues, especially electrosensitive tissues.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Endogenous electric fields (EF) are the basis of bioelectric signal conduction and the priority signal for damaged tissue regeneration. Tissue exudation directly affects the characteristics of endogenous EF. However, current biomaterials lead to passive repair of defect tissue due to limited management of early wound exudates and inability to actively respond to coupled endogenous EF. Herein, the 3D bionic short-fiber scaffold with the functions of early biofluid collection, response to coupled endogenous EF was constructed by guiding the short fibers into a 3D network structure using electrospinning, homogenization, crosslinking, and subsequent multifunctional modification. The scaffold exhibited rapid and reversible water absorption performance, reaching maximum after only 30 seconds.

         <title>Boosting Charge Transport in BiVO4 Photoanode for Solar Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The ability to regulate charge separation is pivotal for obtaining high efficiency of any photoelectrode used for solar fuel production. Vacancy engineering for metal oxide semiconductor photoelectrode has been a major strategy but has faced a formidable challenge in bulk charge transport because of the elusive charge self&#8208;trapping site. In this work, we report a new deep eutectic solvent to engineer bismuth vacancies (Bivac) of BiVO4 photoanode, the novel Bivac can remarkably increase the charge diffusion coefficient by 5.8 times (from 1.82 &#215; 10&#8722;7 to 1.06 &#215; 10&#8722;6 cm2 s&#8722;1), which remarkably boosts the charge transport efficiency. Through further loading CoBi cocatalyst to enhance charge transfer efficiency, the photocurrent density of BiVO4 photoanode with optimal Bivac concentration reaches 4.5 mA/cm2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE under AM 1.5 G illumination, which is higher than that of previously reported Ovac engineered BiVO4 photoanode where the BiVO4 photoanode was synthesized by a similar procedure. This work perfects a cation defect engineering that enables the potential capability to equate the charge transport properties in different types of semiconductor materials for solar fuel conversion.

         <title>Vibrational Strong Coupling between Surface Phonon Polaritons and Organic Molecules via Single Quartz Micropillars</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Vibrational strong coupling (VSC), the strong coupling between optical resonances and the dipolar absorption of molecular vibrations at mid&#8208;infrared frequencies, holds the great potential for the development of ultra&#8208;sensitive infrared spectroscopy, the modification of chemical properties of molecules, and the control of chemical reactions. In the realm of ultracompact VSC, there is a need to scale down the size of mid&#8208;infrared optical resonators and to elevate their optical field strength. Herein, by using single quartz micropillars as mid&#8208;infrared optical resonators, we have demonstrated the strong coupling between surface phonon polariton (SPhP) resonances and molecular vibrations from far&#8208;field observation. The single quartz micropillars support sharp SPhP resonances with an ultra&#8208;small mode volume, which strongly couples with the molecular vibrations of 4&#8208;nitrobenzyl alcohol (C7H7NO3) molecules featuring pronounced mode splitting and anti&#8208;crossing dispersion. The coupling strength depends on the molecular concentration and reaches the strong coupling regime with only 7,300 molecules. Our findings pave the way for promoting the VSC sensitivity, miniaturing the VSC devices, and will boost the development of ultra&#8208;compact mid&#8208;infrared spectroscopy and chemical reaction control devices.

         <title>Biodegradable Metal&#8208;Organic Framework&#8208;Gated Organosilica for Tumor Microenvironment&#8208;Unlocked Glutathione Depletion&#8208;Enhanced Synergistic Therapy</title>

Abstract
The clinical employment of cisplatin (CDDP) is largely constrained due to the non&#8208;specific delivery and resultant serious systemic toxicity. Small&#8208;sized biocompatible and biodegradable hollow mesoporous organosilica (HMOS) nanoparticles show superior advantages for targeted CDDP delivery but suffer from premature CDDP leakage. Herein, we make the smart use of a bimetallic Zn2+/Cu2+ co&#8208;doped metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) to block the pores of HMOS for preventing potential leakage of CDDP and remarkably increasing the loading capacity of HMOS. Once reaching the acidic tumor microenvironment (TME), the outer MOF can decompose quickly to release CDDP for chemotherapy against cancer. Besides, the concomitant release of dopant Cu2+ can deplete the intracellular glutathione (GSH) for increased toxicity of CDDP as well as catalyzing the decomposition of intratumoral H2O2 into highly toxic &#8226;OH for chemodynamic therapy (CDT). Moreover, the substantially reduced GSH can also protect the yielded &#8226;OH from scavenging and thus greatly improve the &#8226;OH&#8208;based CDT effect. In addition to providing a hybrid HMOS@MOF nanocarrier, this study is also expected to establish a new form of TME&#8208;unlocked nanoformula for highly efficient tumor&#8208;specific GSH depletion&#8208;enhanced synergistic chemo&#8208;chemodynamic therapy.

         <title>Multifunctional Separator Allows Stable Cycling of Potassium Metal Anodes and of Potassium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dendrite&#8208;free potassium metal anode and potassium metal battery are achieved by a multifunctional separator of double&#8208;coated reactive AlF3 on polypropylene. It possesses improved electrolyte wetting and uptake, ion conductivity, and ion transference numbers, facilitating uniform K&#8208;ion flux, and plays as an artificial solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), facilitating stable KF, Al2O3, and AlF3 SEI.








Abstract
This is the first report of a multifunctional separator for potassium&#8208;metal batteries (KMBs). Double&#8208;coated tape&#8208;cast microscale AlF3 on polypropylene (AlF3@PP) yields state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrochemical performance: symmetric cells are stable after 1000 cycles (2000 h) at 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 0.5 mAh cm&#8722;2, with 0.042&#160;V overpotential. Stability is maintained at 5.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for 600 cycles (240 h), with 0.138&#160;V overpotential. Postcycled plated surface is dendrite&#8208;free, while stripped surface contains smooth solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Conventional PP cells fail rapidly, with dendrites at plating, and &#8220;dead metal&#8221; and SEI clumps at stripping. Potassium hexacyanoferrate(III) cathode KMBs with AlF3@PP display enhanced capacity retention (91% at 100 cycles vs 58%). AlF3 partially reacts with K to form an artificial SEI containing KF, AlF3, and Al2O3 phases. The AlF3@PP promotes complete electrolyte wetting and enhances uptake, improves ion conductivity, and increases ion transference number. The higher of K+ transference number is ascribed to the strong interaction between AlF3 and FSI&#8722; anions, as revealed through 19F NMR. The enhancement in wetting and performance is general, being demonstrated with ester&#8208; and ether&#8208;based solvents, with K&#8208;, Na&#8208;, or Li&#8208; salts, and with different commercial separators. In full batteries, AlF3 prevents Fe crossover and cycling&#8208;induced cathode pulverization.

         <title>In Situ Architecting Endogenous Heterojunction of MoS2 Coupling with Mo2CTx MXenes for Optimized Li+ Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unique endogenous hetero&#8208;MXenes of amorphous MoS2 coupling with fluoride&#8208;free Mo2CTx directly from Mo2Ga2C MAX is constructed in situ. The obtained hetero&#8208;Mo2C shows extraordinary structural stability and optimized Li+ storage mechanism with reversible structural transformation. Moreover, the improved capability of electron and ion transport endows hetero&#8208;Mo2C electrode with superior lithium storage performance, which surpasses all reported Mo2C MXenes electrode materials.








Abstract
Endogenous heterojunction of 2D MXenes with unique structure shows inspiring potential in energy applications, which is impeded by complex synthesis method and finite MAX materials. Herein, an in situ hydrothermal strategy is implemented to successfully synthesize unique endogenous hetero&#8208;MXenes of amorphous MoS2 coupling with fluoride&#8208;free Mo2CTx (hetero&#8208;Mo2C) directly from Mo2Ga2C MAX. The distinctive morphology and heterojunction structure caused by the introduction of MoS2 endow the hetero&#8208;MXenes with extraordinary structural stability and optimized Li+ storage mechanism with improved charge transport and lithium ion adsorption capabilities. As a result, hetero&#8208;Mo2C exhibits excellent electrochemical performance with a high discharge specific capacity of 1242 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1 and long cycle stability of 683.9 mAh g&#8722;1 after 1200 cycling. This work provides new insights into rational design of novel MXenes heterojunctions, practically important for the development of MXenes and their applications in high&#8208;performance energy storage systems.

         <title>Atomic Fe&#8211;N4/C in Flexible Carbon Fiber Membrane as Binder&#8208;Free Air Cathode for Zn&#8211;Air Batteries with Stable Cycling over 1000 h</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible and free&#8208;standing carbon membrane with atomically dispersed Fe&#8211;N4/C sites is constructed and used as electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction/evolution reaction. In virtue of the hierarchical porous structures and optimized local atomic configurations, the as&#8208;synthesized noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free membrane as binder&#8208;free air cathode demonstrates a stable cycling over 1000 h for Zn&#8211;air battery.








Abstract
Noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free, durable, and high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction and evolution reaction (ORR/OER) are vital for rechargeable Zn&#8211;air batteries (ZABs). Herein, a flexible and free&#8208;standing carbon fiber membrane immobilized with atomically dispersed Fe&#8211;N4/C catalysts (Fe/SNCFs&#8208;NH3) is synthesized and used as air cathode for ZABs. The intertwined fibers with hierarchical nanopores facilitate the gas transportation, electrolyte infiltration and electron transfer. The large specific surface area exposes a high concentration of Fe&#8211;N4/C sites embedded in the carbon matrix. Modulation of local atomic configurations by sulfur doping in Fe/SNCFs&#8208;NH3 catalyst leads to excellent ORR and enhanced OER activities. The as&#8208;synthesized Fe/SNCFs&#8208;NH3 catalyst demonstrates a positive half&#8208;wave potential of 0.89&#160;V and a small Tafel slope of 70.82&#160;mV dec&#8211;1, outperforming the commercial Pt/C (0.86&#160;V/94.74&#160;mV dec&#8211;1) and most reported M&#8211;Nx/C (M = Fe, Co, Ni) catalysts. Experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations uncover the crucial role of S doping in regulating ORR and OER activities. The liquid&#8208;state ZABs with Fe/SNCFs&#8208;NH3 catalyst as air cathode deliver a large peak power density of 255.84&#160;mW cm&#8211;2 and long&#8208;term cycle durability over 1000 h. Solid&#8208;state ZAB shows stable cycling at various flat/bent/flat states, demonstrating great prospects in flexible electronic device applications.

         <title>Highly Efficient Blue Phosphorescence from Pillar&#8208;Layer MOFs by Ligand Functionalization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient (QYphos.&#160;= 80.6%), long&#8208;lived (169.7&#160;ms) blue phosphorescence has been achieved in pillar&#8208;layer metal&#8211;organic frameworks based on the isolation and lock of ligand chromophores. The potential applications of these phosphors in 3D printing, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and fingerprint visualization have been demonstrated owing to the excellent chemical and mechanical stability.








Abstract
Room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) has been extensively researched in heavy&#8208;metal containing complexes and purely organic systems. Despite the rapid blossom of RTP materials, it is still a tremendous challenge to develop highly efficient blue RTP materials with long&#8208;lived lifetimes. Taking the metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) as a model, herein, a feasible strategy of ligand functionalization is proposed, including two essential elements, to develop blue phosphorescence materials with high efficiency and long&#8208;lived lifetimes simultaneously under ambient conditions. One is isolation of the chromophores with assistance of another predefined co&#8208;ligands, the other is restriction of the chromophores&#8217; motions through coordination and host&#8208;guest interactions. Remarkably, it renders the MOFs with highly efficient blue phosphorescence up to 80.6% and a lifetime of 169.7&#160;ms under ambient conditions. Moreover, a demo of the crown is fabricated with MOFs ink by 3D printing technique. The potential applications for anti&#8208;counterfeiting and fingerprint visualization have been also demonstrated. This finding not only outlines a universal principle to design and synthesize highly efficient RTP materials, but also endows traditional MOFs with fresh vitality for potential applications.

         <title>Shielding Ferritin with a Biomineralized Shell Enables Efficient Modulation of Tumor Microenvironment and Targeted Delivery of Diverse Therapeutic Agents</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible ferritin&#8208;based platform is developed through biomineralization, in which calcium phosphate is generated on the ferritin surface. Such a &#8220;shielding&#8221; strategy not only enables efficient drug delivery to tumor and powerful tumor microenvironment modulation, but also brings additional functionalities by loading diverse drugs in the cavity and the shell for potent antitumor effects on multiple cell and patient&#8208;derived xenografts.








Abstract
Ferritin (Fn) is considered a promising carrier for targeted delivery to tumors, but the successful application in vivo has not been fully achieved yet. Herein, strong evidence is provided that the Fn receptor is expressed in liver tissues, resulting in an intercept effect in regards to tumor delivery. Building on these observations, a biomineralization technology is rationally designed to shield Fn using a calcium phosphate (CaP) shell, which can improve the delivery performance by reducing Fn interception in the liver while re&#8208;exposing it in acidic tumors. Moreover, the selective dissolution of the CaP shell not only neutralizes the acidic microenvironment but also induces the intratumoral immunomodulation and calcification. Upon multiple cell line and patient&#8208;derived xenografts, it is demonstrated that the elaboration of the highly flexible Fn@CaP chassis by loading a chemotherapeutic drug into the Fn cavity confers potent antitumor effects, and additionally encapsulating a photosensitizer into the outer shell enables a combined chemo&#8208;photothermal therapy for complete suppression of advanced tumors. Altogether, these results support Fn@CaP as a new nanoplatform for efficient modulation of the tumor microenvironment and targeted delivery of diverse therapeutic agents.

In all&#8208;small&#8208;molecule organic solar cells (ASM&#8208;OSCs), a high short&#8208;circuit current (Jsc) usually needs a small phase separation, while a high fill factor (FF) is generally realized in a highly ordered packing system. However, small domain and ordered packing always conflicted each other in ASM&#8208;OSCs, leading to a mutually restricted Jsc and FF. In this study, alleviation of the previous dilemma by the strategy of obtaining simultaneous good miscibility and ordered packing through modulating homo&#8208; and heteromolecular interactions is proposed. By moving the alkyl&#8208;thiolation side chains from the para&#8208; to the meta&#8208;position in the small&#8208;molecule donor, the surface tension and molecular planarity are synchronously enhanced, resulting in compatible properties of good miscibility with acceptor BTP&#8208;eC9 and strong self&#8208;assembly ability. As a result, an optimized morphology with multi&#8208;length&#8208;scale domains and highly ordered packing is realized. The device exhibits a long carrier lifetime (39.8 &#956;s) and fast charge collection (15.5&#160;ns). A record efficiency of 16.2% with a high FF of 75.6% and a Jsc of 25.4&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in the ASM&#8208;OSCs is obtained. These results demonstrate that the strategy of simultaneously obtaining good miscibility with high crystallinity could be an efficient photovoltaic material design principle for high&#8208;performance ASM&#8208;OSCs.

         <title>In Situ Sprayed Starvation/Chemodynamic Therapeutic Gel for Post&#8208;Surgical Treatment of IDH1 (R132H) Glioma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A starvation/chemodynamic therapeutic gel of GOx@MnCaP@fibrin is developed for post&#8208;surgical treatment of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) (R132H) glioma, through depleting intratumoral glucose and generating high levels of reactive oxygen species.








Abstract
Complete resection of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) (R132H) glioma is unfeasible and the classic post&#8208;surgical chemo/radiotherapy suffers from high recurrence and low survival rate. IDH1 (R132H) cells are sensitive to low concentrations of glucose and high concentrations of reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to inherent metabolism reprograming. Hence, a starvation/chemodynamic therapeutic gel is developed to combat residual IDH1 (R132H) tumor cells after surgery. Briefly, glucose oxidase (GOx) is mineralized with manganese&#8208;doped calcium phosphate to form GOx@MnCaP nanoparticles, which are encapsulated into the fibrin gel (GOx@MnCaP@fibrin). After spraying gel in the surgical cavity, GOx catalyzes the oxidation of glucose in residual IDH1 (R132H) cells and produces H2O2. The generated H2O2 is further converted into highly lethal hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH) by a Mn2+&#8208;mediated Fenton&#8208;like reaction to further kill the residual IDH1 (R132H) cells. The as&#8208;prepared starvation/chemodynamic therapeutic gel shows much higher therapeutic efficacy toward IDH1 (R132H) cells than IDH1 (WT) cells, and achieves long&#8208;term survival.

         <title>Tuning the Transport Properties of Gases in Porous Graphene Membranes with Controlled Pore Size and Thickness</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gas&#8208;separation membranes based on porous graphene (PG) offer ultimate permeance; however, they show low selectivity. The pore&#8208;narrowing approach, via gold deposition onto PG, allows both the thickness and the pore size of the membrane to be tuned to obtain a high number of pores below 3&#160;nm, enabling increased gas&#8211;surface interactions and molecular sieving for high gas selectivity and permeance.








Abstract
Porous graphene membranes have emerged as promising alternatives for gas&#8208;separation applications due to their atomic thickness enabling ultrahigh permeance, but they suffer from low gas selectivity. Whereas decreasing the pore size below 3&#160;nm is expected to increase the gas selectivity due to molecular sieving, it is rather challenging to generate a large number of uniform small pores on the graphene surface. Here, a pore&#8208;narrowing approach via gold deposition onto porous graphene surface is introduced to tune the pore size and thickness of the membrane to achieve a large number of small pores. Through the systematic approach, the ideal combination is determined as pore size below 3&#160;nm, obtained at the thickness of 100&#160;nm, to attain high selectivity and high permeance. The resulting membrane shows a H2/CO2 separation factor of 31.3 at H2 permeance of 2.23&#160;&#215; 105 GPU (1 GPU = 3.35&#160;&#215; 10&#8722;10&#160;mol s&#8722;1 m&#8722;2 Pa&#8722;1), which is the highest value reported to date in the 105 GPU permeance range. This result is explained by comparing the predicted binding energies of gas molecules with the Au surface, &#8722;5.3&#160;versus &#8722;21&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1 for H2 and CO2, respectively, increased surface&#8211;gas interactions and molecular&#8208;sieving effect with decreasing pore size.

Abstract
Colloidal noble metal nanoparticles are composed of metal cores and organic or inorganic ligand shells. These nanoparticles support size&#8208; and shape&#8208;dependent plasmonic resonances. They can be assembled from dispersions into artificial metamolecules which have collective plasmonic resonances originating from coupled bright and dark optical electric and magnetic modes that form depending on the size and shape of the constituent nanoparticles and their number, arrangement, and interparticle distance. Nanoparticles can also be assembled into extended two&#8208; and three&#8208;dimensional metamaterials that are glassy thin films or ordered thin films or crystals, also known as superlattices and supercrystals. The metamaterials have tunable optical properties that depend on the size, shape, and composition of the nanoparticles, and on the number of nanoparticle layers and their interparticle distance. Interestingly, strong light&#8208;matter interactions in superlattices form plasmon polaritons. Tunable interparticle distances allow designer materials with dielectric functions tailorable from that characteristic of an insulator to that of a metal, and serve as strong optical absorbers or scatterers, respectively. In combination with lithography techniques, these extended assemblies can be patterned to create subwavelength nanoparticle superstructures and form large&#8208;area 2D and 3D metamaterials that manipulate the amplitude, phase, and polarization of transmitted or reflected light.

Abstract
Since the discovery of graphene, its excellent physical properties has greatly improved the performance of optoelectronic devices and brought important technological advances to optical research and its applications. Here, we introduce graphene to the field of optical&#8208;tweezer technology and demonstrate a new graphene&#8208;based opto&#8208;thermoelectric tweezer. This technology not only reduces the incident light energy required by two orders of magnitude (compared with traditional optical tweezers), it also brings new advantages such as a much broader working bandwidth and a larger working area compared to those of widely researched gold&#8208;film&#8208;based opto&#8208;thermoelectric tweezers. Compared with gold film, graphene exhibits higher thermal conductivity and higher uniformity and is easier to process. Thus, we have found that even monolayer graphene provides stable trapping for particles in a broad bandwidth and that performance is enhanced as the number of graphene layers increases. Furthermore, parallel trap multiple particles as desired shapes can be easily generated with structured graphene patterns. This work demonstrates the enormous application potential of graphene in optical&#8208;tweezer technology and will promote their application to the trapping or concentration of cells and biomolecules as well as to microfluidics and biosensors.

         <title>Photoresponsive Vaccine&#8208;Like CAR&#8208;M System with High&#8208;Efficiency Central Immune Regulation for Inflammation&#8208;related Depression</title>

Abstract
Increasing evidence suggests that activation of microglia&#8208;induced neuroinflammation plays a crucial role in the pathophysiology of depression. Consequently, targeting the central nervous system to reduce neuroinflammation holds great promise for the treatment of depression. However, few drugs can enter the brain via a circulatory route through the blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB) to reach the central nervous system efficiently, which limits the pharmacological treatment for neuropsychiatric diseases. Herein, a light&#8208;responsive system named UZPM consisting of blue&#8208;emitting NaYF4:Yb, Tm@zeolitic&#8208;imidazolate framework (UCNP@ZIF&#8208;8), photoacid (PA) and melatonin (MT) is developed to address above issues. Meanwhile, UZPM is introduced into macrophages by functional liposomes fusion and modified with hydroxylamine groups on the cell surface. Aldehyde&#8208;modified cytotoxic T&#8208;lymphocyte&#8208;associated protein&#8208;4 (CTLA&#8208;4) is used as a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) targeting group to modify the surface of macrophages by aldehyde/hydroxylamine condensation to precisely target central M1&#8208;type microglia (CAR&#8208;M&#8208;UZPM). Both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate that the CAR&#8208;M&#8208;UZPM drug delivery system can efficiently penetrate BBB, targeting centrally activated microglia, thus, inhibiting the M1&#8208;type polarization of microglia, producing continuous vaccine&#8208;like anti&#8208;inflammatory effects that prevent the occurrence and development of inflammation&#8208;related depression.

Abstract
Medical robots are invaluable players in non&#8208;pharmaceutical treatment of disabilities. Particularly, using prosthetic and rehabilitation devices with human&#8208;machine interfaces can greatly improve the quality of life for impaired patients. In recent years, flexible electronic interfaces and soft robotics have attracted tremendous attention in this field due to their high biocompatibility, functionality, conformability, and low&#8208;cost. Flexible human&#8208;machine interfaces on soft robotics would make a promising alternative to conventional rigid devices, which could potentially revolutionize the paradigm and future direction of medical robotics in terms of rehabilitation feedback and user experience. In this review, the fundamental components of the materials, structures, and mechanisms in flexible human&#8208;machine interfaces are summarized by recent and renown applications in five primary areas: physical and chemical sensing, physiological recording, information processing and communication, soft robotic actuation, and feedback stimulation. This review further concludes by discussing the outlook and current challenges of these technologies as a human&#8208;machine interface in medical robotics.

         <title>Tailoring Hyperbranched Poly(&#946;&#8208;amino ester)s as a Robust and Universal Platform for Cytosolic Protein Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Cytosolic protein delivery is a prerequisite for protein&#8208;based biotechnologies and therapeutics on intracellular targets. Polymers that can directly complex with proteins to form nano&#8208;assemblies represent one of the most important categories of materials for cytosolic protein delivery, because of the ease of nano&#8208;fabrication, high protein loading efficiency, no need for purification, and maintenance of protein bioactivity. Stable protein encapsulation and efficient intracellular liberation are two critical yet opposite processes toward cytosolic delivery, and polymers that can resolve these two conflicting challenges are still lacking. Herein, hyperbranched poly(&#946;&#8208;amino ester) (HPAE) with backbone&#8208;embedded phenylboronic acid (PBA) was developed to synchronize these two processes, wherein PBA enhanced protein encapsulation via N&#8208;B coordination while triggered polymer degradation and intracellular protein release upon oxidation by H2O2 in cancer cells. Upon optimization of the branching degree, charge density, and PBA distribution, the best&#8208;performing A2&#8208;B3&#8208;C2&#8208;S2&#8208;P2 was identified, which mediated robust delivery of various native proteins/peptides with distinct molecular weights (1.6&#8208;430&#160;kDa) and isoelectric points (4.1&#8208;10.3) into cancer cells, including enzymes, toxins, antibodies, and CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 ribonucleoproteins (RNPs). Moreover, A2&#8208;B3&#8208;C2&#8208;S2&#8208;P2 mediated effective cytosolic delivery of saporin both in vitro and in vivo to provoke remarkable anti&#8208;tumor efficacy. Such a potent and universal platform holds transformative potentials for protein pharmaceuticals.

         <title>Collagen Fiber&#8208;based Advanced Separation Materials: Recent Developments and Future Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Separation plays a critical role in a broad range of industrial applications. Developing advanced separation materials is of great significance for the future development of separation technology. Collagen fibers (CFs), the typical structural proteins, exhibit unique structural hierarchy, amphiphilic wettability and versatile chemical reactivity. These distinctive proprieties provided us infinite possibilities for the rational design of advanced separation materials. During the past two decades, we have already witnessed many progressive achievements in the development of CFs&#8208;derived advanced separation materials. Herein, we focused on the CFs&#8208;based separation materials and reviewed the recent progresses in this topic. CFs widely existing in animal skins display unique hierarchically fibrous structure, amphiphilicity&#8208;enabled surface wetting behaviors, multi&#8208;functionality guaranteed covalent/non&#8208;covalent reaction versatility. These outstanding merits of CFs bring great opportunities for realizing rational design of a variety of advanced separation materials that were capable of achieving high&#8208;performance separations to diverse specific targets, including oily pollutants, natural products, metal ions, anionic contaminants and proteins, etc. Besides, we also discussed the important issues for the further development of CFs&#8208;based advanced separation materials.

         <title>Two Birds with One Stone: Interfacial Engineering of Multifunctional Janus Separator for Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An all&#8208;in&#8208;one multifunctional Janus separator is prepared using interfacial engineering strategies to improve the performance of Li&#8211;S batteries. The reversibility of the Li&#8208;metal anode is greatly enhanced and the shuttle effect of the sulfur cathode is effectively suppressed. This work offers a promising strategy to simultaneously tackle the challenges facing the metallic Li anode and the sulfur cathode in Li&#8211;S batteries.








Abstract
Li&#8208;dendrite growth and unsatisfactory sulfur cathode performance are two core problems that restrict the practical applications of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs). Here, an all&#8208;in&#8208;one design concept for a Janus separator, enabled by the interfacial engineering strategy, is proposed to improve the performance of LSBs.

&lt;p&gt;An all-in-one multifunctional Janus separator is prepared using interfacial engineering strategies to improve the performance of Li&#8211;S batteries. The reversibility of the Li-metal anode is greatly enhanced and the shuttle effect of the sulfur cathode is effectively suppressed. This work offers a promising strategy to simultaneously tackle the challenges facing the metallic Li anode and the sulfur cathode in Li&#8211;S batteries.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Li-dendrite growth and unsatisfactory sulfur cathode performance are two core problems that restrict the practical applications of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs). Here, an all-in-one design concept for a Janus separator, enabled by the interfacial engineering strategy, is proposed to improve the performance of LSBs. At the interface of the anode/separator, the thin functionalized composite layer contains high-elastic-modulus and high-thermal-conductivity boron nitride nanosheets and oxygen-group-grafted cellulose nanofibers (BNNs@CNFs), by which the formation of &#8220;hot spots&#8221; can be effectively avoid, the Li-ion flux homogenized, and dendrite growth suppressed. Meanwhile, at the interface between the separator and the cathode, the homogenously exposed single-atom Ru on the surface of reduced graphene oxide (rGO@Ru SAs) can &#8220;trap&#8221; polysulfides and reduce the activation energy to boost their conversion kinetics. Consequently, the LSBs show a high capacity of 460 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 5C and ultrastable cycling performance with an ultralow capacity decay rate of 0.046% per cycle over 800 cycles. To further demonstrate the practical prospect of the Janus separator, a lithium&#8211;sulfur pouch cell using the Janus separator delivers a cell-level energy density of 310.2&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This study provides a promising strategy to simultaneously tackle the challenges facing the Li anode and the sulfur cathode in LSBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dynamic metal&#8208;ligand interaction of synergistic polymers for bistable see&#8208;through electrochromic devices</title>

Abstract
Bistable electrochromic materials are a promising alternative solution to reduce the energy consumption in display. Limited by the mechanism and lack of design strategy, only a few electrochromic materials could truly achieve bistability. Herein, we proposed a novel strategy to design bistable electrochromic materials based on the polymer&#8208;assisted dynamic metal&#8208;ligand coordination. The mechanism and materials of such unconventional electrochromic systems were proved by sufficient characterization. Synergistic stabilization of polymerized switchable dyes and the ionic ligand polymer are attracted to each other by supramolecular forces. In this work, the color states of dye molecules were controlled and stabilized by the valence changes of metal ions. At the same time, through the polymerization of the EC material and the nearby metal ligand material, the metal ions of the electro&#8208;induced valence change were tightly fixed, and the related diffusion problem of the active EC component was also almost completely suppressed. This strategy successfully enabled us to prepare the corresponding low open voltage (0.7V),&#160;high&#160;transmittance&#160;(74%) transparent electrochromic display. It can keep the display information clearly visible for more than 1.5 h without consuming energy (transmittance attenuation rate &lt;8%).&#160;More importantly, the new way of dynamic coordination or dissociation bistable display could likely prosper the development of the electrochromic area and inspire other fields with more pleasant surprise.

         <title>Additive&#8208;free, Low&#8208;temperature Crystallization of Stable &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 Perovskite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI3) is attractive for photovoltaic devices due to its optimal bandgap at around 1.45&#160;eV and improved thermal stability compared with methylammonium based perovskites. Crystallization of phase&#8208;pure &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 conventionally requires high&#8208;temperature thermal annealing at 150&#176;C whilst the obtained &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 is metastable at room temperature Here we report aerosol assisted crystallization (AAC) to convert yellow &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3 into black &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 at only 100&#176;C using precursor solutions containing only lead iodide (PbI2) and formamidinium iodide (FAI) with no chemical additives. The obtained &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 exhibits remarkably enhanced stability compared to the 150&#176;C annealed counterparts, in combination with improvement in film crystallinity and photoluminescence yield. Using X&#8208;ray diffraction, X&#8208;ray scattering and density functional theory simulation, we identify that relaxation of residual tensile strains, achieved through the lower annealing temperature and post&#8208;crystallization crystal growth during AAC, is the key factor that facilitates the formation of phase&#8208;stable &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3. This overcomes strain&#8208;induced lattice expansion that is known to cause the metastability of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3. Accordingly, we report pure FAPbI3 p&#8208;i&#8208;n solar cells for the first time, facilitated by the low&#8208;temperature (&#8804; 100&#176;C) AAC processing, which demonstrate increases of both power conversion efficiency and operational stability compared to devices fabricated using 150&#176;C annealed films.

         <title>Cluster Fragments in Amorphous Phosphorus and their Evolution under Pressure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine&#8208;learning&#8208;driven simulations provide new insight into the structure of amorphous phosphorus. The structural model so obtained contains abundant five&#8208;membered rings and more complex cluster fragments. The simulation results help to understand previous experimental observations at ambient and high pressure, and they provide an example of the emerging application of machine&#8208;learned potentials to complex functional materials.








Abstract
Amorphous phosphorus (a&#8208;P) has long attracted interest because of its complex atomic structure, and more recently as an anode material for batteries. However, accurately describing and understanding a&#8208;P at the atomistic level remains a challenge. Here, it is shown that large&#8208;scale molecular&#8208;dynamics simulations, enabled by a machine&#8208;learning (ML)&#8208;based interatomic potential for phosphorus, can give new insights into the atomic structure of a&#8208;P and how this structure changes under pressure. The structural model so obtained contains abundant five&#8208;membered rings, as well as more complex seven&#8208; and eight&#8208;atom clusters. Changes in the simulated first sharp diffraction peak during compression and decompression indicate a hysteresis in the recovery of medium&#8208;range order. An analysis of cluster fragments, large rings, and voids suggests that moderate pressure (up to about 5&#160;GPa) does not break the connectivity of clusters, but higher pressure does. The work provides a starting point for further computational studies of the structure and properties of a&#8208;P, and more generally it exemplifies how ML&#8208;driven modeling can accelerate the understanding of disordered functional materials.

Abstract
he ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID&#8208;19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2), has killed untold millions worldwide and has hurtled vaccines into the spotlight as a go&#8208;to approach to mitigate it. Advances in virology, genomics, structural biology, and vaccine technologies enabled a rapid and unprecedented rollout of COVID&#8208;19 vaccines, although much of the developing world remains unvaccinated. Several new vaccine platforms have been developed or deployed against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, with most targeting the large viral Spike immunogen. Those that safely induce strong and durable antibody responses at low dosages are advantageous, as well are those that can be rapidly produced at a large scale. Virtually all COVID&#8208;19 vaccines and adjuvants possess nanoscale or microscale dimensions and represent diverse and unique biomaterials. Viral vector vaccine platforms, lipid nanoparticle mRNA vaccines and multimeric display technologies for subunit vaccines have received much attention. Nanoscale vaccine adjuvants have also been used in combination with other vaccines. To deal with the ongoing pandemic, and to be ready for potential future ones, advanced vaccine technologies will continue to be developed in the near future. In this review, we summarize recent use of advanced materials used for developing COVID&#8208;19 vaccines.

         <dc:description>
Three D&#8211;D type wide&#8208;bandgap donor polymers (PBDTT, PBDTT1Cl, and PBDTT2Cl) are designed and facilely synthesized. Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on PBDTT1Cl exhibit a high power conversion efficiency of 17% and a low nonradiative energy loss of 0.19&#160;eV. In addition, PBDTT1Cl has a very low figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit and good universality, indicating its potential as a low&#8208;cost polymer donor for high&#8208;performance OSCs.








Abstract
Three regioregular benzodithiophene&#8208;based donor&#8211;donor (D&#8211;D)&#8208;type polymers (PBDTT, PBDTT1Cl, and PBDTT2Cl) are designed, synthesized, and used as donor materials in organic solar cells (OSCs). Because of the weak intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer effect, these polymers exhibit large optical bandgaps (&gt;2.0&#160;eV). Among these three polymers, PBDTT1Cl exhibits more ordered and closer molecular stacking, and its devices demonstrate higher and more balanced charge mobilities and a longer charge&#8208;separated state lifetime. As a result of these comprehensive benefits, PBDTT1Cl&#8208;based OSCs give a very impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.10% with a low nonradiative energy loss (0.19&#160;eV). Moreover, PBDTT1Cl also possesses a low figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit value and good universality to match with different acceptors. This work provides a simply and efficient strategy to design low&#8208;cost high&#8208;performance polymer donor materials.

         <title>The Quest for Stable Potassium&#8208;Ion Battery Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;energy and long&#8208;cycling potassium&#8208;ion battery is demonstrated, using a K2MnFe(CN)6 Prussian white cathode, a prepotassiated graphite anode, and a concentrated electrolyte. This full cell delivers a high energy density of 260&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 (based on the active mass of cathode and anode) and stable cycling over 1000 cycles.








Abstract
Potassium&#8208;ion batteries (KIBs) have attracted wide interest for energy storage because of the abundance of the electrode materials involved; however, their electrochemical performances are far behind what can be achieved from lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) or sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, key promising electrode and electrolyte materials for potassium&#8208;ion batteries are identified, the coupled electrochemical reactions in the cell are investigated, and the compatibility between different materials is demonstrated to play the most important role. K2Mn[Fe(CN)6] cathode can deliver a high capacity of &#8776;125 mAh g&#8722;1 and exceptional cycling stability over 61&#160;000 cycles (&#8776;9 months) if the side reactions from the anode can be prevented. Graphite is a good anode material but is subjected to degradation in traditional carbonate electrolytes. New concentrated electrolytes are developed and evaluated. A stable KIB system is demonstrated by coupling a stable K2Mn[Fe(CN)6] cathode, a prepotassiated graphite anode with a concentrated electrolyte to achieve a high energy density of &#8776;260&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 (based on the active mass of cathode and anode) and good cycling of over 1000 cycles.

         <title>Boosting Continuous&#8208;Wave Laser&#8208;Driven Nonlinear Photothermal white Light Generation by Nanoscale Porosity</title>

Abstract
The irradiation of an optically absorptive medium by a continuous&#8208;wave (CW) near&#8208;infrared (NIR) laser could result in spectral continuum emission covering both visible and NIR regions, which is attractive for applications as continuum light sources in diverse fields. We show here that this NIR laser&#8208;driven light emission can be effectively modulated with nanoscale architecture in the medium. By using porous silica as the model matrix and Yb3+ ions as the photothermally active centers, we demonstrate up to 100 folds increment in NIR&#8208;laser induced emission intensity and dramatic decrease in threshold excitation density. We observe that the emission intensity exhibits a strong nonlinear dependence on the power of the NIR excitation laser, featuring clear excitation power thresholds. Based on combined numerical simulation, spectral and temperature measurements, the improved broadband emission and photothermal nonlinearity are interpreted by enhanced optical energy localization around the laser spot that results in boosting the photon&#8208;to&#8208;photon conversion efficiency. We further demonstrate conceptually the use of the nonlinear photothermal emission process as a broadband NIR light source, which could be exploited for applications including NIR spectroscopy, imaging and sensing.

         <title>Zwitterionic polymer electroplating facilitates the preparation of electrode surface for biosensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Surface chemistry critically affects the diagnostic performance of biosensors. An ideal sensor surface should be resistant to nonspecific protein adsorption, yet be conducive to analytical responses. Here we report a new polymeric material, zwitterionic polypyrrole (ZiPPy), to produce optimal surface condition for biosensing electrodes. ZiPPy combines merits from two unique precursors: the zwitterionic function that efficiently hydrates electrode surface, hindering nonspecific binding of hydrophobic proteins; and the pyrrole backbone which enables rapid (&lt;7&#160;min), controlled deposition of ZiPPy through electropolymerization. ZiPPy&#8208;coated electrodes showed lower electrochemical impedance and less non&#8208;specific protein adsorption (low fouling), outperforming bare and polypyrrole&#8208;coated electrodes. Moreover, affinity ligands for target biomarkers could be immobilized together with ZiPPy in a single&#8208;step electropolymerization. We developed ZiPPy&#8208;coated electrodes with specificity for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2). The prepared sensor detected SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 antibodies in human saliva down to 50&#160;ng mL&#8211;1, without need for sample purification or secondary labeling.

         <title>Electrostatic&#8211;Mechanical Synergistic In Situ Multiscale Tissue Adhesion for Sustainable Residue&#8208;Free Bioelectronics Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrostatic&#8211;mechanical, synergistic, in situ, multiscale tissue adhesion for various bioelectronic applications is demonstrated. To deduce the mechanism, a thermodynamic model based on a tailored elastomer&#8211;hydrogel combinatory adhesive architecture is proposed. Reliable real&#8208;time measurements of electrophysiological signals generated by various tissues, ranging from rodent sciatic nerve, the muscle, brain, and human skin, are also successfully demonstrated.








Abstract
Recent studies on soft adhesives have sought to deeply understand how their chemical or mechanical structures interact strongly with living tissues. The aim is to optimally address the unmet needs of patients with acute or chronic diseases. Synergistic adhesion involving both electrostatic (hydrogen bonds) and mechanical interactions (capillarity&#8208;assisted suction stress) seems to be effective in overcoming the challenges associated with long&#8208;term unstable coupling to tissues. Here, an electrostatically and mechanically synergistic mechanism of residue&#8208;free, sustainable, in situ tissue adhesion by implementing hybrid multiscale architectonics. To deduce the mechanism, a thermodynamic model based on a tailored multiscale combinatory adhesive is proposed. The model supports the experimental results that the thermodynamically controlled swelling of the nanoporous hydrogel embedded in the hierarchical elastomeric structure enhances biofluid&#8208;insensitive, sustainable, in situ adhesion to diverse soft, slippery, and wet organ surfaces, as well as clean detachment in the peeling direction. Based on the robust tissue adhesion capability, universal reliable measurements of electrophysiological signals generated by various tissues, ranging from rodent sciatic nerve, the muscle, brain, and human skin, are successfully demonstrated.

Reliable real-time measurements of electrophysiological signals generated by various tissues, ranging from rodent sciatic nerve, the muscle, brain, and human skin, are also successfully demonstrated.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent studies on soft adhesives have sought to deeply understand how their chemical or mechanical structures interact strongly with living tissues. The aim is to optimally address the unmet needs of patients with acute or chronic diseases. Synergistic adhesion involving both electrostatic (hydrogen bonds) and mechanical interactions (capillarity-assisted suction stress) seems to be effective in overcoming the challenges associated with long-term unstable coupling to tissues. Here, an electrostatically and mechanically synergistic mechanism of residue-free, sustainable, in situ tissue adhesion by implementing hybrid multiscale architectonics. To deduce the mechanism, a thermodynamic model based on a tailored multiscale combinatory adhesive is proposed. The model supports the experimental results that the thermodynamically controlled swelling of the nanoporous hydrogel embedded in the hierarchical elastomeric structure enhances biofluid-insensitive, sustainable, in situ adhesion to diverse soft, slippery, and wet organ surfaces, as well as clean detachment in the peeling direction. Based on the robust tissue adhesion capability, universal reliable measurements of electrophysiological signals generated by various tissues, ranging from rodent sciatic nerve, the muscle, brain, and human skin, are successfully demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Quantum sensing of thermoelectric power in low&#8208;dimensional materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Thermoelectric power, has been extensively studied in low&#8208;dimensional materials where quantum confinement and spin textures can largely modulate thermopower generation. In addition to classical and macroscopic values, thermopower also varies locally over a wide range of length scales, and is fundamentally linked to electron wave functions and phonon propagation. Various experimental methods for the quantum sensing of localized thermopower have been suggested, particularly based on scanning probe microscopy. Here, we introduce critical advances in the quantum sensing of thermopower, from the atomic to the several&#8208;hundred&#8208;nanometer scales, including the unique role of low&#8208;dimensionality, defects, spins, and relativistic effects for optimized power generation. Investigating the microscopic nature of thermopower in quantum materials can provide insights useful for the design of advanced materials for future thermoelectric applications. Quantum sensing techniques for thermopower can pave the way to practical and novel energy devices for a sustainable society.

         <title>An Annealing Accelerator for Ising Spin Systems Based on In&#8208;Memory Complementary 2D FETs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Energy&#8208; and area&#8208;efficient hardware acceleration of simulated annealing for the Ising spin system is achieved by exploiting subthreshold conduction and programmability of 2D field&#8208;effect transistors based on p&#8208;type WSe2 and n&#8208;type MoS2. Search acceleration of &gt;800&#215; for 4 &#215; 4 ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and spin glass systems is demonstrated with a miniscule energy dissipation of &#8776;120 nJ.








Abstract
Metaheuristic algorithms such as simulated annealing (SA) are often implemented for optimization in combinatorial problems, especially for discreet problems. SA employs a stochastic search, where high&#8208;energy transitions (&#8220;hill&#8208;climbing&#8221;) are allowed with a temperature&#8208;dependent probability to escape local optima. Ising spin glass systems have properties such as spin disorder and &#8220;frustration&#8221; and provide a discreet combinatorial problem with a high number of metastable states and ground&#8208;state degeneracy. In this work, subthreshold Boltzmann transport is exploited in complementary 2D field&#8208;effect transistors (p&#8208;type WSe2 and n&#8208;type MoS2) integrated with an analog, nonvolatile, and programmable floating&#8208;gate memory stack to develop in&#8208;memory computing primitives necessary for energy&#8208; and area&#8208;efficient hardware acceleration of SA for Ising spin systems. Search acceleration of &gt;800&#215; is demonstrated for 4 &#215; 4 ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and spin glass systems using SA compared to an exhaustive search using a brute force trial at miniscule total energy expenditure of &#8776;120 nJ. The hardware&#8208;realistic numerical simulations further highlight the astounding benefits of SA in accelerating the search for larger spin lattices.

         <title>Controlling the Emission Zone by Additives for Improved Light&#8208;Emitting Electrochemical Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The position of the emission zone (EZ) in the active material of a light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cell (LEC) has a profound influence on its performance because of microcavity effects and doping&#8208; and electrode&#8208;induced quenching. Previous attempts of EZ control have focused on the two principal constituents in the active material &#8211; the organic semiconductor (OSC) and the mobile ions &#8211; but this study demonstrates that it is possible to effectively control the EZ position through the inclusion of an appropriate additive into the active material. More specifically, it is shown that a mere modification of the end group on an added neutral compound, which also functions as an ion transporter, results in a shifted EZ from close to the anode to the center of the active material, which translates into a 60% improvement of the power efficiency. This particular finding is rationalized by a lowering of the effective electron mobility of the OSC through specific additive:OSC interactions, but the more important generic conclusion is that it is possible to control the EZ position, and thereby the LEC performance, by the straightforward inclusion of an easily tuned additive into the active material.

         <title>Ethylamine Iodide Additive Enables Solid&#8208;to&#8208;Solid Transformed Highly Oriented Perovskite for Excellent Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Perovskite has been widely applied in the optoelectronic field due to its strong light absorption and high carrier mobility. Maintaining high crystallization is critical to fabricate high&#8208;performance perovskite devices, where many methods have been reported, such as the use of additives in precursor solutions. However, there are few reports for the working mechanism of these additives. In this article, we report a new method to obtain highly crystalline FAPbI3 perovskite films by introducing ethylamine iodide (EAI) into perovskite precursors and propose a novel working mechanism for such alkyl amine additives in the crystallization process of perovskites. Unlike traditional liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid (L&#8208;S) crystallization theory, our research results indicate that EAI affects the solid&#8208;to&#8208;solid (S&#8208;S) transition process from the intermediate yellow phase to the final black phase, and this mechanism is further verified to be universal using other common alkyl amines. A self&#8208;powered photodetector based on an as&#8208;fabricated FAPbI3 film is fabricated with an external quantum efficiency of over 90%. This work provides a deeper understanding of the perovskite crystallization process.

         <title>A Tissue&#8208;Like Soft All&#8208;Hydrogel Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
All&#8208;hydrogel batteries with Young's moduli of 80&#160;kPa are designed to match the mechanical properties of the skin and the heart. They exhibit a high specific capacity of 370 mAh g&#8722;1 and maintains stability during dynamic deformation. High stability and biocompatibility are realized on the skin and in vivo, so these all&#8208;hydrogel batteries are an ideal power supply for wearable and implantable bioelectronics.








Abstract
To develop wearable and implantable bioelectronics accommodating the dynamic and uneven biological tissues and reducing undesired immune responses, it is critical to adopt batteries with matched mechanical properties with tissues as power sources. However, the batteries available cannot reach the softness of tissues due to the high Young's moduli of components (e.g., metals, carbon materials, conductive polymers, or composite materials). The fabrication of tissue&#8208;like soft batteries thus remains a challenge. Here, the first ultrasoft batteries totally based on hydrogels are reported. The ultrasoft batteries exhibit Young's moduli of 80&#160;kPa, perfectly matching skin and organs (e.g., heart). The high specific capacities of 82 mAh g&#8722;1 in all&#8208;hydrogel lithium&#8208;ion batteries and 370 mAh g&#8722;1 in all&#8208;hydrogel zinc&#8208;ion batteries at a current density of 0.5 A g&#8722;1 are achieved. Both high stability and biocompatibility of the all&#8208;hydrogel batteries have been demonstrated upon the applications of wearable and implantable. This work illuminates a pathway for designing power sources for wearable and implantable electronics with matched mechanical properties.

         <title>Bioinspired 2D Isotropically Fatigue&#8208;Resistant Hydrogels</title>

Abstract
Engineering conventional hydrogels with muscle&#8208;like anisotropic structures could efficiently increase the fatigue threshold over 1,000 J m&#8722;2 along the alignment direction. However, fatigue threshold in perpendicular to the alignment was&#160;still as low as 100&#8764;300 J m&#8722;2, making them non&#8208;suitable for those scenarios where isotropic properties are desired. Here, inspired by the distinct structure&#8208;properties relationship of heart valves, we&#160;report a simple yet general strategy to engineer conventional hydrogels with unprecedented yet isotropic fatigue resistance, with a record&#8208;high fatigue threshold over 1,500 J m&#8722;2 along two arbitrary in&#8208;plane directions. Our&#160;two&#8208;step process involves the formation of preferentially&#8208;aligned lamellar micro/nanostructures through a bidirectional freeze&#8208;casting process, followed by compression annealing, synergistically contributing to extraordinary resistance to fatigue crack propagation. Our&#160;study provides a viable means of fabricating soft materials with isotropically extreme properties, thereby unlocking paths to apply these advanced soft materials toward applications including soft robotics, flexible electronics, e&#8208;skins and tissue&#160;patches.

         <title>A General Strategy to Immobilize Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts to Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are being witnessed a rapid development due to their high activity and selectivity toward diverse reactions. However, it remains a grand challenge in the general synthesis of SACs, particularly featuring identical chemical microenvironment and on the same support. Herein, we have developed a universal synthetic protocol to immobilize SACs to metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs). Significantly, by means of SnO2 as a mediator or adaptor, not only different single&#8208;atom metal sites, such as Pt, Cu and Ni, etc., can be installed, but also the MOF supports can be changed (for example, UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, PCN&#8208;222, and DUT&#8208;67) to afford M1/SnO2/MOF architecture. Taking UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 as a representative, the Pt1/SnO2/MOF exhibit &#8764;5 times higher activity toward photocatalytic H2 production than the corresponding Pt nanoparticles (&#8764;2.5&#160;nm) stabilized by SnO2/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2. Remarkably, despite featuring identical parameters in chemical microenvironment and support in M1/SnO2/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, the Pt1 catalyst possesses a hydrogen evolution rate of 2167 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8211;1&#183;h&#8211;1, superior to the Cu1 and Ni1 counterparts, which is attributed to the differentiated hydrogen binding free energies, as supported by density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the universal approach to the stabilization of SACs with identical chemical microenvironment on the identical support.

Abstract
Organic materials with radical characteristics are gaining increasing attention, due to their potential implications in highly efficient utilization of solar energy. Manipulating intermolecular interactions are crucial for tuning radical properties, as well as regulating their absorption bands, and thus improving the photothermal conversion efficiency. Herein, we report a diradical&#8208;featured organic small&#8208;molecule croconium derivative, CR&#8208;DPA&#8208;T, for highly efficient utilization of solar energy. Upon aggregation, CR&#8208;DPA&#8208;T exists in dimer stablized by the strong intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions, and exhibits rarely reported high&#8208;spin state. Benefiting from the synergic effects of radical characteristics and strong intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions, CR&#8208;DPA&#8208;T powder absorbs broadly from 300 to 2000&#160;nm. In&#8208;depth investigations with transient absorption analysis reveal that the strong intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions could promote non&#8208;radiative relaxation by accelerating internal conversion and facilitating intermolecular charge transfer (ICT) between dimeric molecules to open up faster internal conversion pathways. Remarkably, CR&#8208;DPA&#8208;T powder demonstrates a high photothermal efficiency of 79.5% under 808&#160;nm laser irradiation. By employing CR&#8208;DPA&#8208;T as solar harvester, a flexible H&#8208;PDMS/CR&#8208;DPA&#8208;T self&#8208;healing film is fabricated and employed for solar thermal applications. These findings provide a feasible guideline for developing highly efficient diradical&#8208;featured organic photothermal materials.

Abstract
The development of novel electrochemical energy storage devices is a grand challenge. Here, we develop an aqueous ammonium&#8208;ion hybrid supercapacitor (A&#8208;HSC), consisting of a layered &#948;&#8208;MnO2 based cathode, an activated carbon cloth anode, and an aqueous (NH4)2SO4 electrolyte. The aqueous A&#8208;HSC demonstrates an ultrahigh areal capacitance of 1550 mF cm&#8722;2 with a wide voltage window of 2.0 V. An amenable peak areal energy density (861.2 &#956;Wh cm&#8722;2) and a decent capacitance retention (72.2% after 5000 cycles) have also been achieved, surpassing traditional metal&#8208;ion hybrid supercapacitors. Ex&#8208;situ characterizations reveal that NH4+ intercalation/de&#8208;intercalation in the layered &#948;&#8208;MnO2 is accompanied by hydrogen bond formation/breaking. This work proposes a new paradigm for electrochemical energy storage.

         <title>Lattice Polarity Manipulation of Quasi&#8208;vdW Epitaxial GaN Films on Graphene Through Interface Atomic Configuration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The manipulation of the lattice polarity of quasi&#8208;vdW epitaxial GaN on graphene through controlling the interface atomic configuration is reported. This polarity&#8208;control rule is not affected by the growth method and is free of either crystalline or non&#8208;crystalline substrates. It makes the epitaxy of III&#8208;nitrides with preferred lattice polarity possible and improves the ability to fabricate advanced semiconductor devices.








Abstract
Quasi van der Waals epitaxy, a pioneering epitaxy of sp3&#8208;hybridized semiconductor films on sp2&#8208;hybridized 2D materials, provides a way, in principle, to achieve single&#8208;crystal epilayers with preferred atom configurations that are free of substrate. Unfortunately, this has not been experimentally confirmed in the case of the hexagonal semiconductor III&#8208;nitride epilayer until now. Here, it is reported that the epitaxy of gallium nitride (GaN) on graphene can tune the atom arrangement (lattice polarity) through manipulation of the interface atomic configuration, where GaN films with gallium and nitrogen polarity are achieved by forming C&#63743;O&#63743;N&#63743;Ga(3) or C&#63743;O&#63743;Ga&#63743;N(3) configurations, respectively, on artificial C&#63743;O surface dangling bonds by atomic oxygen pre&#8208;irradiation on trilayer graphene. Furthermore, an aluminum nitride buffer/interlayer leads to unique metal polarity due to the formation of an AlON thin layer in a growth environment containing trace amounts of oxygen, which explains the open question of why those reported wurtzite III&#8208;nitride films on 2D materials always exhibit metal polarity. The reported atomic modulation through interface manipulation provides an effective model for hexagonal nitride semiconductor layers grown on graphene, which definitely promotes the development of novel semiconductor devices.

Here, it is reported that the epitaxy of gallium nitride (GaN) on graphene can tune the atom arrangement (lattice polarity) through manipulation of the interface atomic configuration, where GaN films with gallium and nitrogen polarity are achieved by forming C&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;O&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;N&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;Ga(3) or C&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;O&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;Ga&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;N(3) configurations, respectively, on artificial C&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;O surface dangling bonds by atomic oxygen pre-irradiation on trilayer graphene. Furthermore, an aluminum nitride buffer/interlayer leads to unique metal polarity due to the formation of an AlON thin layer in a growth environment containing trace amounts of oxygen, which explains the open question of why those reported wurtzite III-nitride films on 2D materials always exhibit metal polarity. The reported atomic modulation through interface manipulation provides an effective model for hexagonal nitride semiconductor layers grown on graphene, which definitely promotes the development of novel semiconductor devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Construction of Ni(CN)2/NiSe2 Heterostructures by Stepwise Topochemical Pathways for Efficient Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unique Ni(CN)2/NiSe2 heterostructures are constructed by a stepwise topochemical method from a Hofmann&#8208;type coordination polymer precursor. The heterostructure is formed by growing NiSe2 nanocrystals preferentially on the edges of each Ni(CN)2 nanoplate. Benefitting from the synergy of two components, the formed Ni(CN)2/NiSe2 heterostructure catalyst manifests improves electrocatalytic performance for the oxygen evolution reaction.








Abstract
Exploiting effective electrocatalysts based on elaborate heterostructures for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has been considered as a promising strategy for boosting water splitting efficiency to produce the clean&#160;energy&#8212;hydrogen. However, constructing catalytically active heterostructures with novel composition and architecture remains poorly developed due to the synthetic challenge. In this work, it is demonstrated that unique Ni(CN)2/NiSe2 heterostructures, composed of single&#8208;crystalline Ni(CN)2 nanoplates surrounded by crystallographically aligned NiSe2 nanosatellites, can be created from nickel&#8208;based Hofmann&#8208;type coordination polymers through stepwise topochemical pathways. When employed as the OER electrocatalyst, the Ni(CN)2/NiSe2 heterostructures show enhanced performance, which could be attributed to optimized geometric and electronic structures of the catalytic sites endowed by the synergy between the two components. This work demonstrates a rational synthetic route for creating a novel Ni&#8208;based OER electrocatalyst that possesses nanoscale heterostructure, whose composition, spatial organization, and interface configuration can be finely manipulated.

         <title>Manipulating Electroluminochromism Behavior of Viologen&#8208;Substituted Iridium(III) Complexes through Ligand Engineering for Information Display and Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of viologen&#8208;substituted iridium(III) complexes is designed to manipulate their electroluminochromism behavior. By attaching pyridiniums to the diimine or cyclometalating ligand and judiciously selecting the co&#8208;ligands, luminescence response to electrical stimuli is achieved in intensity, wavelength, and lifetime, which demonstrates anti&#8208;counterfeiting display through naked&#8208;eye detection, near&#8208;infrared camera, or time&#8208;resolved luminescence.








Abstract
Electrically controlling photoluminescence has attracted great research interest and offers many opportunities for technological developments. Electroluminochromic materials undergo redox reactions under low&#8208;voltage stimuli to achieve reversible luminescence switching. Till now, photoluminescence switching of a single molecule caused by electrical stimuli is restricted to intensity response because the redox&#8208;active moieties are good electron donors or acceptors and electrical stimuli can regulate the photoinduced electron&#8208;transfer and affect the luminescence intensity. In this work, the manipulation of the electroluminochromism behavior of a series of viologen&#8208;substituted iridium(III) complexes through the regulation of ligand orbital energy levels and electronic communication between the viologen pendants and the iridium(III) complex core is reported. Electrochemical redox reactions reversibly modulate either the luminescence quenching effect or the push&#8211;pull electronic effect of the viologen substituents, achieving multicolor &#8220;on&#8211;off&#8221; luminescence response toward electrical stimuli and luminescence manipulation between two emissive states with different wavelengths and lifetimes. To illustrate the promising applications of these electroluminochromic materials, recording and displaying luminescence information under electrical stimuli are demonstrated. Information encryption is realized by letting the electroluminochromism occur in the near&#8208;infrared region or in the time domain. Near&#8208;infrared camera or time&#8208;resolved luminescence analysis can be used to help read the invisible information.

         <title>Nanolayer laser absorber for femtoliter chemistry in polymer reactors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Laser&#8208;induced forward transfer (LIFT) has the potential to be an alternative approach to atomic force microscopy based scanning probe lithography techniques, which have limitations in high&#8208;speed and large&#8208;scale patterning. However, traditional donor slides limit the resolution and chemical flexibility of LIFT. Here, we propose a hematite nanolayer absorber for donor slides to achieve high&#8208;resolution transfers down to sub&#8208;femtoliters. Being wettable by both aqueous and organic solvents, this new donor significantly increases the chemical scope for the LIFT process. For parallel amino acid coupling reactions, the patterning resolution can now be increased more than five times (&gt;111,000 spots/cm2 for hematite donor versus 20,000 spots/cm2 for standard polyimide donor) with even faster scanning (2&#160;versus 6&#160;ms per spot). Due to the increased chemical flexibility, we could explore other types of reactions inside ultrasmall polymer reactors: copper (I) catalyzed click chemistry and laser&#8208;driven oxidation of a tetrahydroisoquinoline derivative, suggesting the potential of LIFT for both deposition of chemicals and laser&#8208;driven photochemical synthesis in femtoliters within milliseconds. Since the hematite shows no damage after typical laser transfer, donors can be regenerated by heat treatment. These findings will transform the LIFT process into an automatable, precise, and highly efficient technology for high&#8208;throughput femtoliter chemistry.

         <title>MIL&#8208;96&#8208;Al for Li&#8211;S Batteries: Shape or Size?</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MIL&#8208;96&#8208;Al crystals with hexagonal platelet crystal (HPC), hexagonal bipyramidal crystal (HBC), and hexagonal prismatic bipyramidal crystal (HPBC) shapes are successfully prepared by co&#8208;solvent methods. Moreover, by changing the ratio of the cosolvent, different sizes of the HBC shape are prepared. These MIL&#8208;96 crystals are used as sulfur hosts to investigate their ability to suppress the shuttle effect in Li&#8211;S batteries.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with controllable shapes and sizes show a great potential in Li&#8211;S batteries. However, neither the relationship between shape and specific capacity nor the influence of MOF particle size on cyclic stability have been fully established yet. Herein, MIL&#8208;96&#8208;Al with various shapes, forming hexagonal platelet crystals (HPC), hexagonal bipyramidal crystals (HBC), and hexagonal prismatic bipyramidal crystals (HPBC) are successfully prepared via cosolvent methods. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the HBC shape with highly exposed (101) planes can effectively adsorb lithium polysulfides (LPS) during the charge/discharge process. By changing the relative proportion of the cosolvents, HBC samples with different particle sizes are prepared. When these MIL&#8208;96&#8208;Al crystals are used as sulfur host materials, it is found that those with a smaller size of the HBC shape deliver higher initial capacity. These investigations establish that different crystal planes have different adsorption abilities for LPS, and that the MOF particle size should be considered for a suitable sulfur host. More broadly, this work provides a strategy for designing sulfur hosts in Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <dc:description>
An overview of organic exciton&#8208;polaritonics is given. First, the principle of polariton formation and polariton condensation is introduced.

Abstract
Exciton&#8208;polaritons are half&#8208;light, half&#8208;matter bosonic quasiparticles formed by strong exciton&#8211;photon coupling in semiconductor microcavities. These hybrid particles possess the strong nonlinear interactions of excitons and keep most of the characteristics of the underlying photons. As bosons, above a threshold density they can undergo Bose&#8211;Einstein condensation to a polariton condensate phase and exhibit a rich variety of exotic macroscopic quantum phenomena in solids. Recently, organic semiconductors have been considered as a promising material platform for these studies due to their room&#8208;temperature stability, good processability, and abundant photophysics and photochemistry. Herein, recent advances of exciton&#8208;polaritons and their Bose&#8211;Einstein condensates in organic semiconductor microcavities are summarized. First, the basic physics is introduced, and then their emerging applications are highlighted. The remaining questions are also discussed and a personal viewpoint about the potential directions for future research is given.

         <title>Continuous Carbon Channels Enable Full Na&#8208;ion Accessibility for Superior Room&#8208;temperature Na&#8208;S Batteries</title>

Abstract
Porous carbon has been widely used as an efficient host to encapsulate highly active molecular sulfur (S) in Li&#8208;S and Na&#8208;S batteries. However, for these sub&#8208;nanosized pores, it is a challenge to provide fully accessible sodium ions with unobstructed channels during cycling, particularly for high sulfur content. It is well recognized that solid interphase with full coverage over the designed architectures plays critical roles in promoting rapid charge transfer and stable conversion reactions in batteries. Whereas, constructing high ionic conductive solid interphase in the pores is very difficult. Herein, unique continuous carbonaceous pores are tailored, which can serve as multifunctional channels to encapsulate highly active S and provide fully accessible pathways for sodium ions. Solid sodium sulfide interphase layers have also been realized in the channels, showing high Na&#8208;ion conductivity towards stabilizing the redox kinetics of S cathode during charge/discharge processes. This systematically designed carbon&#8208;hosted sulfur cathode delivered superior cycling performance (420 mAh g&#8722;1 at 2 A g&#8722;1 after 2000 cycles), high&#8208;capacity retention of &#8764; 90% over 500 cycles at current density of 0.5 A g&#8722;1, and outstanding rate capability (470 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 A g&#8722;1) for room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;sulfur batteries.

         <title>Influence of Molecular Weight on the Organic Electrochemical Transistor Performance of Ladder&#8208;Type Conjugated Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
n&#8208;Type organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) underperform compared to p&#8208;type OECTs. By tuning the molecular weight of the rigid ladder&#8208;type poly(benzimidazobenzophenanthroline), n&#8208;type OECTs with record&#8208;high figures of merit are reported. OECT&#8208;based complementary inverters are also demonstrated with high voltage gains of up to 100&#160;V V&#8722;1 and ultralow power consumption down to 0.32 nW, depending on the supply voltage.








Abstract
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) hold promise for developing a variety of high&#8208;performance (bio&#8208;)electronic devices/circuits. While OECTs based on p&#8208;type semiconductors have achieved tremendous progress in recent years, n&#8208;type OECTs still suffer from low performance, hampering the development of power&#8208;efficient electronics. Here, it is demonstrated that fine&#8208;tuning the molecular weight of the rigid, ladder&#8208;type n&#8208;type polymer poly(benzimidazobenzophenanthroline) (BBL) by only one order of magnitude (from 4.9 to 51&#160;kDa) enables the development of n&#8208;type OECTs with record&#8208;high geometry&#8208;normalized transconductance (gm,norm&#160;&#8776; 11 S cm&#8722;1) and electron mobility &#215; volumetric capacitance (&#181;C* &#8776; 26 F cm&#8722;1&#160;V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1), fast temporal response (0.38&#160;ms), and low threshold voltage (0.15&#160;V). This enhancement in OECT performance is ascribed to a more efficient intermolecular charge transport in high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight BBL than in the low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight counterpart. OECT&#8208;based complementary inverters are also demonstrated with record&#8208;high voltage gains of up to 100&#160;V V&#8722;1 and ultralow power consumption down to 0.32 nW, depending on the supply voltage. These devices are among the best sub&#8208;1 V&#160;complementary inverters reported to date. These findings demonstrate the importance of molecular weight in optimizing the OECT performance of rigid organic mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductors and open for a new generation of power&#8208;efficient organic (bio&#8208;)electronic devices.

         <title>Interfacial Design for 4.6&#160;V High&#8208;Voltage Single&#8208;Crystalline LiCoO2 Cathode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Single&#8208;crystalline cathode materials have attracted intensive interest in offering greater capacity retention than their polycrystalline counterparts by reducing materials surfaces and phase boundaries. However, the single&#8208;crystalline LiCoO2 suffers severe structural instability and capacity fade when charged to high voltages (4.6&#160;V) due to Co element dissolution and O loss, crack formation, and subsequent electrolyte penetration. Herein, by forming a robust cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) in all&#8208;fluorinated electrolyte, the reversible planar gliding along the (003) plane in a single&#8208;crystalline LiCoO2 cathode is protected due to the prevention of element dissolution and electrolyte penetration. The robust CEI effectively controls the performance fade issue of the single&#8208;crystalline cathode at a high operating voltage of 4.6&#160;V, providing new insights for improved electrolyte design of high energy density battery cathode materials.

         <title>Stable quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Aluminum Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Nonaqueous rechargeable aluminum batteries (RABs) of low cost and high safety are promising for next&#8208;generation energy storage. With the presence of ionic liquid (IL) electrolytes, their high moisture&#8208;sensitivity and poor stability would lead to critical issues in the liquid RABs, including undesirable gas production, irreversible activity loss and unstable electrode interface, which undermines the operation stability. To address such issues, herein a stable quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte is developed via encapsulating a small amount of IL into a metal organic framework (IL@MOF), which not only prevents IL from moisture, but creates sufficient ionic transport network between active materials and electrolyte. Owing to the generated stable states at both positive electrode&#8208;electrolyte and negative electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces, the as&#8208;assembled quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Al&#8208;graphite batteries deliver specific capacity of &#8764;75&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 (with positive electrode material loading &#8764;9&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, much higher than that in the conventional liquid systems). The batteries present a long&#8208;term cycling stability beyond 2000 cycles, with great stability even upon exposing to air within 2 hours and under flame combustion tests. Such technology opens a new platform of designing highly safe rechargeable Al batteries for stable energy storage.

&lt;p&gt;Nonaqueous rechargeable aluminum batteries (RABs) of low cost and high safety are promising for next-generation energy storage. With the presence of ionic liquid (IL) electrolytes, their high moisture-sensitivity and poor stability would lead to critical issues in the liquid RABs, including undesirable gas production, irreversible activity loss and unstable electrode interface, which undermines the operation stability. To address such issues, herein a stable quasi-solid-state electrolyte is developed via encapsulating a small amount of IL into a metal organic framework (IL@MOF), which not only prevents IL from moisture, but creates sufficient ionic transport network between active materials and electrolyte.

         <title>Achieving Ultimate Narrowband and Ultrapure Blue Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Based on Polycyclo&#8208;Heteraborin Multi&#8208;Resonance Delayed Fluorescence Emitters</title>

Abstract
To achieve an ultimate wide color gamut for ultrahigh&#8208;definition displays, there is great demand for the development of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) enabling monochromatic, ultrapure blue electroluminescence (EL). Herein, we report high&#8208;efficiency and ultrapure blue OLEDs based on polycyclo&#8208;heteraborin multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) materials, BOBO&#8208;Z, BOBS&#8208;Z, and BSBS&#8208;Z. The key to the design of the present luminophores is the exquisite combination and interplay of multiple boron, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur heteroatoms embedded in a fused polycyclic &#960;&#8208;system. Comprehensive photophysical and computational investigations of this family of MR&#8208;TADF materials revealed that the systematic implementation of chalcogen (oxygen and sulfur) atoms can finely modulate the emission color while maintaining a narrow bandwidth, as well as the spin&#8208;flipping rates between the excited singlet and triplet states via spin&#8211;orbit coupling. Consequently, OLEDs based on BOBO&#8208;Z, BOBS&#8208;Z, and BSBS&#8208;Z demonstrated narrowband and ultrapure blue EL emissions, with peaks at 445&#8211;463&#160;nm and full width at half&#8208;maxima of 18&#8211;23&#160;nm, leading to CIE&#8208;y coordinates in the range of 0.04&#8211;0.08. Particularly, for OLEDs incorporating sulfur&#8208;doped BOBS&#8208;Z and BSBS&#8208;Z, notably high maximum external EL quantum efficiencies of 26.9% and 26.8%, respectively, and small efficiency roll&#8208;offs at a practical luminance, were achieved concurrently.

         <title>Cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;biomimetic Nanoparticles for Targeted Therapy of Multiple Myeloma Based on Bone Marrow Homing</title>

Abstract
Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most common hematological malignancy. It is characterized by abnormal transformation and uncontrolled clonal proliferation of malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow (BM), which can destroy bone structure and inhibit hematopoiesis. Although there are new therapeutic methods, they are not curative, mainly because it is difficult to deliver an effective amount of drug to BM, leading to a failure to eradicate the MM cells inside the BM. BM homing is an important and unique characteristic of MM cells and it is mainly affected by surface molecules on the tumor cell membrane. Inspired by this mechanism, we developed an MM&#8208;mimicking nanocarrier by coating the bortezomib (BTZ)&#8208;loaded PCEC nanoparticles with the MM membrane. The MM&#8208;mimicking nanoparticles can enter the BM based on BM homing as a &#8220;Trojan Horse&#8221; and target the tumor cells through homologous targeting. In this way, drug availability at the myeloma site was enhanced so as to inhibit MM growth. In addition, these MM&#8208;mimicking nanoparticles could escape phagocytosis by the MPS and have a long circulation effect. The in vivo therapeutic results demonstrated an excellent treatment efficacy for MM. Accordingly, this strategy may be a promising platform for the treatment of MM.

         <title>Designing Next Generation of Persistent Luminescence: Recent Advances in Uniform Persistent Luminescence Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Persistent luminescence is a unique optical process where long&#8208;lasting afterglow persists after the cessation of excitation. Nanoscale persistent luminescent materials have been getting increased research interest from various fields due to their unique optical property. In recent years, inspiring achievements have been made to produce uniform persistent luminescence nanoparticles (PLNPs) in a controllable manner, unleashing their fascinating potential, surpassing other types of luminescent materials in a wide variety of application such as high&#8208;contrast bioimaging and high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray detection. In this review, we first summarize the evolution of uniform PLNPs, from their bulk phosphor counterparts, to the &#8220;top&#8208;down&#8221; preparation of nanoscale persistent luminescent materials, to the recent &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; synthesis of uniform PLNPs. The respective milestones of uniform PLNPs prepared by templated synthesis, aqueous synthesis, and colloidal synthesis are highlighted. We will then analyze the key optical properties that can be enhanced in uniform PLNPs, including increasing the persistent luminescence intensity, tuning the excitation irradiance, as well as the emission wavelengths. Detailed strategies to enhance each optical property will also be discussed in various sections. Finally, future challenges are highlighted with respect to the perspectives on the development of next generation PLNPs with novel applications.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;sensitive Linear&#8208;dendritic Block Copolymer&#8208;drug Prodrug As Nano&#8208;platform for Tumor Combination Therapy</title>

Abstract
Linear&#8208;dendritic block copolymer (LDBCs) are highly attractive candidates for smart drug delivery vehicles. Herein, we report an amphiphilic poly[(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate] (POEGMA) linear&#8208;peptide dendritic prodrug of doxorubicin (DOX) prepared by reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. A hydrophobic dye&#8208;based photosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6) was employed for encapsulation in the prodrug nanoparticles (NPs) to obtain a LDBCs&#8208;based drug delivery system (LD&#8208;DOX/Ce6) which offered a combination cancer therapy. Due to the presence of Gly&#8208;Phe&#8208;Leu&#8208;Gly peptides and hydrazone bonds in the prodrug structure, LD&#8208;DOX/Ce6 were degraded into small fragments, thus specifically triggering the intracellular release of DOX and Ce6 in the tumor microenvironment. Bioinformatics analysis suggested that LD&#8208;DOX/Ce6 with laser irradiation treatment significantly induced apoptosis, DNA damage and cell cycle arrest. The combination treatment could not only suppress tumor growth, but also significantly reduced tumor metastasis compared with treatments with DOX or Ce6 through regulating EMT pathway, TGF&#946; pathway, angiogenesis and the hypoxia pathway. LD&#8208;DOX/Ce6 displayed a synergistic chemo&#8208;photodynamic anti&#8208;tumor efficacy, resulting in a high inhibition in tumor growth and metastasis, while maintaining an excellent biosafety. Therefore, this study has demonstrated potential of the biodegradable and tumor microenvironment&#8208;responsive LDBCs as an intelligent multifunctional drug delivery vehicle for high&#8208;efficiency cancer combination therapy.

         <title>Interface Engineering Between multi&#8208;elemental alloy Nanoparticles and Carbon Support Toward Stable Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Multi&#8208;elemental alloy (MEA) nanoparticles recently receive notable attention owing to their high activity and superior phase stability. Previous syntheses of MEA nanoparticles mainly use carbon as the support owing to its high surface area, good electrical conductivity, and tunable defective sites. However, the interfacial stability issue, such as nanoparticle agglomeration, remains outstanding due to the poor interfacial bonding between MEA and carbon. Such a problem often causes performance decay when the MEA nanoparticles are used as catalysts, which hinders their practical application. Herein, we develop an interface engineering strategy to synthesize MEA&#8208;oxide&#8208;carbon hierarchical catalysts, where the oxide on carbon help disperse and stabilize MEA nanoparticles toward superior thermal and electrochemical stability. Using several MEA compositions (i.e., PdRuRh, PtPdIrRuRh and PdRuRhFeCoNi) and metal oxides (i.e., TiO2 and Cr2O3) as model systems, we show that adding the metal oxide renders superior interfacial stability and therefore excellent catalytic performance. We demonstrate excellent thermal stability under transmission electron microscopy with in situ heating up to 1023 K, as well as via long&#8208;term cycling (&gt; 370 hours) of Li&#8208;O2 battery as a harsh electrochemical condition to challenge the catalyst stability. This work offers a new route towards constructing efficient and stable catalysts for a range of applications.

Urease&#8208;producing haloalkalophilic&#160;bacteria can be used as biocatalyst adhered to the surface of bioceramics to form a biomineral layer: urea as the substrate is converted to carbonate by bacterial catalysis, and the subsequently increased CO32&#8722; reacts with the Ca2+ existing around the bacterial cells, leading to the formation of micro/nanostructures on the biomaterials. The newly generated micro/nanostructures facilitated by bacteria promote bone&#8208;forming bioactivity.








Abstract
Bone is a complex mineralized tissue composed of various organic (proteins, cells) and inorganic (hydroxyapatite, calcium carbonate) substances with micro/nanoscale structures. To improve interfacial bioactivity of bone&#8208;implanted biomaterials, extensive efforts are being made to fabricate favorable biointerface via surface modification. Inspired by microbially catalyzed mineralization, a novel concept to biologically synthesize the micro/nanostructures on bioceramics, microbial&#8208;assisted catalysis, is presented. It involves three processes: bacterial adhesion on biomaterials, production of CO32&#8722; assisted by bacteria, and nucleation and growth of CaCO3 nanocrystals on the surface of bioceramics. The microbially catalyzed biominerals exhibit relatively uniform micro/nanostructures on the surface of both 2D and 3D &#945;&#8208;CaSiO3 bioceramics. The topographic and chemical cues of the grown micro/nanostructures present excellent in vitro and in vivo bone&#8208;forming bioactivity. The underlying mechanism is closely related to the activation of multiple biological processes associated with bone regeneration. The study offers a microbially catalytic concept and strategy of fabricating micro/nanostructured biomaterials for tissue regeneration.

         <title>Atmospheric Hygroscopic Ionogels with Dynamically Stable Cooling Interfaces Enable a Durable Thermoelectric Performance Enhancement</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hygroscopic ionogel (RIG) is developed to dissipate waste heat from working thermoelectric generators (TEGs) through self&#8208;sustained evaporative cooling to efficiently enhance their electric output. Moreover, the well&#8208;designed adhesive property of the RIG ensures a stable cooling interface with the targeted TEGs surface either in static or dynamic conditions for a durable improvement of thermoelectric performance.








Abstract
In thermoelectric generator (TEG) systems, heat dissipation from their cold sides is an accessible, low&#8208;cost, and effective way to increase the temperature gap for their thermoelectric performance enhancement. Although significant efforts have been dedicated mediated by hygroscopic hydrogel coolers as self&#8208;sustained alternatives for effective heat removal, it still remains a challenge for overcoming instabilities in their cooling process. The inevitable mechanical deformation of these conventional hydrogels induced by excessive water desorption may cause a detached cooling interface with the targeted substrates, leading to undesirable cooling failure. Herein, a self&#8208;sustained and durable evaporative cooling approach for TEG enabled by atmospheric hygroscopic ionogels (RIGs) with stable interfaces to efficiently improve its thermoelectric performance is proposed. Owing to its superior hygroscopicity, the RIGs can achieve higher heat dissipation for TEG through water evaporation than that of common commercial metal heat sinks. Moreover, its favorable adhesion enables the RIG closely interact with the TEG surface either in static or dynamic conditions for a durable thermoelectric performance enhancement. It is believed that such a self&#8208;sustained evaporative cooling strategy based on the RIG will have great implications for the enhancement of TEG's efficiency, demonstrating a great promise in intermittent thermal&#8208;energy utilizations.

         <title>Thermoplastic Elastomer Tunes Phase Structure and Promotes Stretchability of High&#8208;Efficiency Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strategy of introducing low&#8208;cost commercial thermoplastic elastomer in the active layer is put forward to address the long&#8208;standing challenge of mechanical properties improvement of organic solar cells. Meanwhile, the morphology and mechanical performance of ternary blend films are effectively modulated and characterized with advanced scattering and microscopic techniques. This approach is effective to many kinds of high&#8208;efficiency polymer:nonfullerene systems.








Abstract
Top&#8208;performance organic solar cells (OSCs) consisting of conjugated polymer donors and nonfullerene small molecule acceptors (NF&#8208;SMAs) deliver rapid increases in efficiencies. Nevertheless, many of the polymer donors exhibit high stiffness and small molecule acceptors are very brittle, which limit their applications in wearable devices. Here, a simple and effective strategy is reported to improve the stretchability and reduce the stiffness of high&#8208;efficiency polymer:NF&#8208;SMA blends and simultaneously maintain the high efficiency by incorporating a low&#8208;cost commercial thermoplastic elastomer, polystyrene&#8208;block&#8208;poly(ethylene&#8208;ran&#8208;butylene)&#8208;block&#8208;polystyrene (SEBS). The microstructure, mechanical properties, and photovoltaic performance of PM6:N3 with varied SEBS contents and the molecular weight dependence of SEBS on microstructure and mechanical properties are thoroughly characterized. This strategy for mechanical performance improvement exhibits excellent applicability in some other OSC blend systems, e.g., PBQx&#8208;TF:eC9&#8208;2Cl and PBDB&#8208;T:ITIC. More crucially, the elastic modulus of such complex ternary blends can be nicely predicted by a mechanical model. Therefore, incorporating thermoplastic elastomers is a widely applicable and cost&#8208;effective strategy to improve mechanical properties of nonfullerene OSCs and beyond.

         <title>Amorphous VO2: A Pseudocapacitive Platform for High&#8208;Rate Symmetric Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wide&#8208;window pseudocapacitive behavior in amorphous VO2 is reported, which allows the construction of a new pseudocapacitive&#8208;mechanism&#8208;enabled symmetric battery to mitigate the slow kinetics and cycling limitations of previous phase&#8208;transition&#8208;mechanism&#8208;based symmetric devices. Attractive safety superiority is illustrated in the new symmetric device, including high tolerance in overcharging, overdischarging, polarity reversal, and large&#8208;current operation.








Abstract
Among the various VO2 polymorphs, the layered compound, VO2(B), has been the most widely investigated lithium&#8208;ion battery electrode material. For sodium&#8208;ion electrodes, however, an amorphous solid may be more advantageous as a result of the open framework to facilitate ion insertion and the ability to tolerate volumetric changes. Herein, it is shown that the Na+ insertion properties of amorphous VO2 (a&#8208;VO2) are superior to those of crystalline VO2(B). Amorphous VO2 exhibits a linear voltage characteristic over a 3 V range (4.0 to 1.0&#160;V vs Na/Na+) leading to a reversible capacity as high as 400 mAh g&#8722;1 and rapid redox kinetics, which is attributed to its pseudocapacitive nature. The linear voltage characteristic over 3 V affords the opportunity of fabricating a symmetric Na&#8208;ion battery in which the a&#8208;VO2 material serves as both the positive electrode and the negative electrode. Such a symmetric battery offers safer operation in terms of overcharging, overdischarging, polarity reversal, high charge/discharge current abuse, and long&#8208;term usage. The results suggest that amorphous transition metal oxides may offer advantageous attributes for rapid, safe, and energy&#8208;dense storage.

         <title>Optimized Photoclick (Bio)Resins for Fast Volumetric Bioprinting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Volumetric printing enables the generation of centimeter&#8208;sized free&#8208;form 3D objects within seconds. Optimized photoclick&#8208;based photoresins show ideal biophysical and photochemical properties resulting in fast and biocompatible volumetric bioprinting. Thiol&#8211;norbornene photo&#8208;crosslinking outperforms chain&#8208;growth systems permitting significant reduction of radical generation and polymer concentration. This simple and scalable synthesis method opens new avenues for widespread use of photoclick resins in light&#8208;mediated biofabrication.








Abstract
Volumetric printing (VP) is a light&#8208;mediated technique enabling printing of complex, low&#8208;defect 3D objects within seconds, overcoming major drawbacks of layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer additive manufacturing. An optimized photoresin is presented for VP in the presence of cells (volumetric bioprinting) based on fast thiol&#8211;ene step&#8208;growth photoclick crosslinking. Gelatin&#8208;norbornene (Gel&#8208;NB) photoresin shows superior performance, both in physicochemical and biocompatibility aspects, compared to (meth&#8208;)acryloyl resins. The extremely efficient thiol&#8211;norbornene reaction produces the fastest VP reported to date (&#8776;10 s), with significantly lower polymer content, degree of substitution (DS), and radical species, making it more suitable for cell encapsulation. This approach enables the generation of cellular free&#8208;form constructs with excellent cell viability (&#8776;100%) and tissue maturation potential, demonstrated by development of contractile myotubes. Varying the DS, polymer content, thiol&#8211;ene ratio, and thiolated crosslinker allows fine&#8208;tuning of mechanical properties over a broad stiffness range (&#8776;40&#160;Pa to &#8776;15&#160;kPa). These properties are achieved through fast and scalable methods for producing Gel&#8208;NB with inexpensive, off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf reagents that can help establish it as the gold standard for light&#8208;mediated biofabrication techniques.

     alt="Optimized Photoclick (Bio)Resins for Fast Volumetric Bioprinting"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volumetric printing enables the generation of centimeter-sized free-form 3D objects within seconds. Optimized photoclick-based photoresins show ideal biophysical and photochemical properties resulting in fast and biocompatible volumetric bioprinting. Thiol&#8211;norbornene photo-crosslinking outperforms chain-growth systems permitting significant reduction of radical generation and polymer concentration. This simple and scalable synthesis method opens new avenues for widespread use of photoclick resins in light-mediated biofabrication.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volumetric printing (VP) is a light-mediated technique enabling printing of complex, low-defect 3D objects within seconds, overcoming major drawbacks of layer-by-layer additive manufacturing. An optimized photoresin is presented for VP in the presence of cells (volumetric bioprinting) based on fast thiol&#8211;ene step-growth photoclick crosslinking. Gelatin-norbornene (Gel-NB) photoresin shows superior performance, both in physicochemical and biocompatibility aspects, compared to (meth-)acryloyl resins. The extremely efficient thiol&#8211;norbornene reaction produces the fastest VP reported to date (&#8776;10 s), with significantly lower polymer content, degree of substitution (DS), and radical species, making it more suitable for cell encapsulation. This approach enables the generation of cellular free-form constructs with excellent cell viability (&#8776;100%) and tissue maturation potential, demonstrated by development of contractile myotubes. Varying the DS, polymer content, thiol&#8211;ene ratio, and thiolated crosslinker allows fine-tuning of mechanical properties over a broad stiffness range (&#8776;40&#160;Pa to &#8776;15&#160;kPa). These properties are achieved through fast and scalable methods for producing Gel-NB with inexpensive, off-the-shelf reagents that can help establish it as the gold standard for light-mediated biofabrication techniques. With potential applications from high-throughput bioprinting of tissue models to soft robotics and regenerative medicine, this work paves the way for exploitation of VPs unprecedented capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Light&#8208;Motivated SnO2/TiO2 Heterojunctions Enabling the Breakthrough in Energy Density for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A photoaccelerated rechargeable lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) employing SnO2/TiO2 heterojunction nanoarrays as a multifunctional anode is demonstrated. The lithiation kinetics and reversibility are greatly enhanced, leading to 1.8 times increase in areal specific capacity without attenuation even for 100 cycles. This finding exhibits a feasible pathway to break the energy density of LIBs by conversion and storage of solar energy.








Abstract
Powering lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) by light&#8208;irradiation will bring a paradigm shift in energy&#8208;storage technologies. Herein, a photoaccelerated rechargeable LIB employing SnO2/TiO2 heterojunction nanoarrays as a multifunctional anode is developed. The electron&#8211;hole pairs generated by the LixTiO2 (x&#160;&#8805; 0) under light irradiation synergistically enhance the lithiation kinetics and electrochemical reversibility of both SnO2 and TiO2. Specifically, the electrons can quickly pour into the SnO2 and the generated Sn due to the more positive conduction band potentials (vs TiO2), and mean while the holes also promote the intercalation of Li+ into TiO2 by reaching charge balance. A remarkable increase in areal specific capacity is therefore achieved from 1.91 to 3.47 mAh cm&#8722;2 at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. More impressively, there is no capacity loss even through 100 cycles, which is the best report for photorechargeable LIBs to date, owing to the strong and stable photoresponse current. This finding exhibits a feasible pathway to break the limitation in the energy density of LIBs by the efficient conversion and storage of solar energy.

         <title>A Morphologically Stable Li/Electrolyte Interface for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries Enabled by 3D&#8208;Micropatterned Garnet</title>

         <dc:description>
Morphological degradation at the Li/solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) interface is a prevalent issue causing performance fading of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries. A novel 3D&#8208;micropatterned SSE that can stabilize the morphology of the Li/SSE interface under relatively high current density and limited stack pressure is reported. The stabilization is achieved by utilizing the synergistic effect of electrochemical and mechanical modifications at the Li/SSE interface.








Abstract
Morphological degradation at the Li/solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) interface is a prevalent issue causing performance fading of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs). To maintain the interfacial integrity, most ASSBs are operated under low current density with considerable stack pressure, which significantly limits their widespread usage. Herein, a novel 3D&#8208;micropatterned SSE (3D&#8208;SSE) that can stabilize the morphology of the Li/SSE interface even under relatively high current density and limited stack pressure is reported. Under the pressure of 1.0&#160;MPa, the Li symmetric cell using a garnet&#8208;type 3D&#8208;SSE fabricated by laser machining shows a high critical current density of 0.7&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 and stable cycling over 500 h under 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8211;2. This excellent performance is attributed to the reduced local current density and amplified mechanical stress at the Li/3D&#8208;SSE interface. These two effects can benefit the flux balance between Li stripping and creep at the interface, thereby preventing interfacial degradation such as void formation and dendrite growth.

         <title>Rippling Ferroic Phase Transition and Domain Switching In 2D Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ripples are strongly coupled with ferroic orders in 2D ferroics. Taking monolayer ferroelectric&#8211;ferroelastic GeSe as an example, it is shown that rippling ferroic phase transition and domain switching can render ultrahigh piezoelectric performance over a broad temperature range in 2D materials. This provides valuable guidance for ripple engineering in 2D materials with potential applications in 2D flexible electronics.








Abstract
Ripples are a class of native structural defects widely existing in 2D materials. They originate from the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane flexibility of 2D materials introducing spatially evolving electronic structure and friction behavior. However, the effect of ripples on 2D ferroics has not been reported. Here a molecular dynamics study of the effect of ripples on the temperature&#8208;induced ferroic phase transition and stress&#8208;induced ferroic domain switching in ferroelastic&#8208;ferroelectric monolayer GeSe is presented. Ripples stabilize the short&#8208;range ferroic orders in the high&#8208;temperature phase with stronger ferroicity and longer lifetime, thereby increasing the transition temperature upon cooling. In addition, ripples significantly affect the domain switching upon loading, changing it from a highly correlated process into a ripple&#8208;driven localized one where ripples act as source of dynamical random stress. These results reveal the fundamental role of ripples on 2D ferroicity and provide theoretical guidance for ripple engineering of controlled phase transition and domain switching with potential applications in flexible 2D electronics.

         <title>An Antipulverization and High&#8208;Continuity Lithium Metal Anode for High&#8208;Energy Lithium Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
An antipulverization and high&#8208;continuity lithium metal anode comprising a small number of solid&#8208;state electrolyte nanoparticles as conformal/sacrificial fillers and a copper foil as supporting current collector is proposed to improve the lithium electrode stability and extend the cyclability of batteries.








Abstract
Lithium metal is one of the most promising anode candidates for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy batteries. Nevertheless, lithium pulverization and associated loss of electrical contact remain significant challenges. Here, an antipulverization and high&#8208;continuity lithium metal anode comprising a small number of solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) nanoparticles as conformal/sacrificial fillers and a copper (Cu) foil as the supporting current collector is reported. Guiding by the SSE, this new anode facilitates lithium nucleation, contributing to form a roundly shaped, micro&#8208;sized, and dendrite&#8208;free electrode during cycling, which effectively mitigates the lithium dendrite growth. The embedded Cu current collector in the hybrid anode not only reinforces the mechanical strength but also improves the efficient charge transfer among active lithium filaments, affording good electrode structural integrity and electrical continuity. As a result, this antipulverization and high&#8208;continuity lithium anode delivers a high average Coulombic efficiency of &#8776;99.6% for 300 cycles under a current density of 1 mA cm&#8722;2. Lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (elemental sulfur or sulfurized polyacrylonitrile cathodes) equipped with this anode show high&#8208;capacity retentions in their corresponding ether&#8208;based or carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes, respectively. This new electrode provides important insight into the design of electrodes that may experience large volume variation during operations.

         <title>High&#8208;Specificity In Vivo Tumor Imaging Using Bioorthogonal NIR&#8208;IIb Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioorthogonal lanthanide&#8208;based nanoprobes are developed for deep&#8208;tissue NIR&#8208;IIb imaging and MRI with high tumor&#8208;targeting specificity. These bioorthogonal nanoprobes offer a 20&#8208;fold increase in the NIR&#8208;IIb imaging signal and a 2&#8208;fold increase in the MRI signal, compared with non&#8208;orthogonal probes.








Abstract
Lanthanide&#8208;based NIR&#8208;IIb nanoprobes are ideal for in vivo imaging. However, existing NIR&#8208;IIb nanoprobes often suffer from low tumor&#8208;targeting specificity, limiting their widespread use. Here the application of bioorthogonal nanoprobes with high tumor&#8208;targeting specificity for in vivo NIR&#8208;IIb luminescence imaging and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is reported. These dual&#8208;modality nanoprobes can enhance NIR&#8208;IIb emission by 20&#8208;fold and MRI signal by twofold, compared with non&#8208;bioorthogonal nanoprobes in murine subcutaneous tumors. Moreover, these bioorthogonal probes enable orthotopic brain tumor imaging. Implementation of bio&#8208;orthogonal chemistry significantly reduces the nanoprobe dose and hence cytotoxicity, providing a paradigm for real&#8208;time in vivo visualization of tumors.

         <title>ZnS@BSA Nanoclusters Potentiate Efficacy of Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
ZnS@BSA (bovine serum albumin) nanoclusters can promote reactive oxygen species accumulation and activate cyclic guanosine monophosphate&#8211;adenosine monophosphate synthase/interferon gene stimulator signals in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), further suppressing tumor growth with more immune cells infiltration, which can serve as a new strategy for immunotherapy of HCC.








Abstract
Although immunotherapy such as immune checkpoint inhibitors has shown promising efficacy in cancer treatment, the responsiveness among patients is relatively limited. Activation of the cyclic guanosine monophosphate&#8208;adenosine monophosphate synthase/interferon gene stimulator (cGAS/STING) signaling pathway to upregulate innate immunity has become an emerging strategy for enhancing tumor immunotherapy. Herein, ZnS@BSA (bovine serum albumin) nanoclusters synthesized via a self&#8208;assembly approach are reported, where the released zinc ions under acidic tumor microenvironment significantly enhance cGAS/STING signals. Meanwhile, intracellular zinc ions can produce reactive oxygen species, which is further facilitated by the generated H2S gas from ZnS@BSA via specifically inhibiting catalase in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. It is found that the nanoclusters activate the cGAS/STING signals in mice, which promotes the infiltration of CD8+ T cells at the tumor site and cross&#8208;presentation of dendritic cells, leading to an improved immunotherapy efficacy against hepatocellular carcinoma.

         <title>Construction of Carbon Dots with Color&#8208;Tunable Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission by Nitrogen&#8208;Induced Intramolecular Charge Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon dots (CDs) with multicolor aggregation&#8208;induced emission exhibit dual fluorescence emission at 480 and 580&#160;nm, which is related to the S&#63743;S bonds of DTSA and the conjugated structure attached to C&#63742;O/C&#63742;N bonds, respectively. With the increase of C&#63742;N content from 35.6% to 58.4%, the intramolecular charge transfer efficiency increases from 8.71% to 45.94%, changing the fluorescence of the CDs from green to red.








Abstract
As one of the most promising fluorescent nanomaterials, the fluorescence of carbon dots (CDs) in solution is extensively studied. Nevertheless, the synthesis of multicolor solid&#8208;state fluorescence (SSF) CDs is rarely reported. Herein, CDs with multicolor aggregation&#8208;induced emission are prepared using amine molecules, all of them exhibiting dual fluorescence emission at 480&#160;nm (Em&#8208;1) and 580&#8211;620&#160;nm (Em&#8208;2), which is related to the S&#63743;S bonds of dithiosalicylic acid and the conjugated structure attached to C&#63742;O/C&#63742;N bonds, respectively. As a strong electron&#8208;withdrawing group, the increase of C&#63742;N content makes dual&#8208;fluorescent groups on the surface of CDs produce push and pull electrons, which determines intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the double emission. With the increase in C&#63742;N content from 35.6% to 58.4%, the ICT efficiency increases from 8.71% to 45.94%, changing the fluorescence of CDs from green to red. The increase of ICT efficiency causes fluorescence quantum yield enhancement by nearly five times and redshift of the fluorescence peak. Finally, based on the multicolor luminescence properties induced by the aggregation of CDs, pattern encryption and white&#8208;LED devices are realized. Based on the fat solubility and strong ultraviolet absorption characteristics of CDs, fingerprint detection and leaf anti&#8208;UV hazards are applied.

         <title>Dynamically Tuneable Reflective Structural Coloration with Electroactive Conducting Polymer Nanocavities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemically tuneable structural coloration is demonstrated based on an optical cavity with a conducting polymer based on thienothiophene as an electroactive spacer layer. Synergistic effects of optical properties and thickness changes enable low&#8208;voltage tuning of the structural color across the whole visible range with high and similar reflectance for all the redox states.








Abstract
Dynamic control of structural colors across the visible spectrum with high brightness has proven to be a difficult challenge. Here, this is addressed with a tuneable reflective nano&#8208;optical cavity that uses an electroactive conducting polymer (poly(thieno[3,4&#8208;b]thiophene)) as spacer layer. Electrochemical doping and dedoping of the polymer spacer layer provides reversible tuning of the cavity's structural color throughout the entire visible range and beyond. Furthermore, the cavity provides high peak reflectance that varies only slightly between the reduced and oxidized states of the polymer. The results indicate that the polymer undergoes large reversible thickness changes upon redox tuning, aided by changes in optical properties and low visible absorption. The electroactive cavity concept may find particular use in reflective displays, by opening for tuneable monopixels that eliminate limitations in brightness of traditional subpixel&#8208;based systems.

         <title>N&#8208;Type Surface Design for p&#8208;Type CZTSSe Thin Film to Attain High Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An n&#8208;type surface is realized successfully on p&#8208;type CZTSSe thin film by controlling the Ag distribution using Ag2ZnSnS4/Al2O3/CZTS precursors. The photogenerated charge collection is improved and the interface recombination is suppressed, thus significantly improving the conversion efficiency of the CZTSSe solar cells.








Abstract
As a low&#8208;cost substitute that uses no expensive rare&#8208;earth elements for the high&#8208;efficiency Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 solar cell, the Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) solar cell has borrowed optimization strategies used for its predecessor to improve its device performance, including a profiled band gap and surface inversion. Indeed, there have been few reports of constructing CZTSSe absorber layers with surface inversion to improve efficiency. Here, a strategy that designs the CZTSSe absorber to attain surface modification by using n&#8208;type Ag2ZnSnS4 is demonstrated. It has been discovered that Ag plays two major roles in the kesterite thin film devices: surface inversion and front gradient distribution. It has not only an excellent carrier transport effect and reduced probability of electron&#8208;hole recombination but also results in increased carrier separation by increasing the width of the depletion region, leading to much improved VOC and JSC. Finally, a champion CZTSSe solar cell renders efficiency as high as 12.55%, one of the highest for its type, with the open&#8208;circuit voltage deficit reduced to as low as 0.306&#160;V (63.2% Shockley&#8208;Queisser limit). The band engineering for surface modification of the absorber and high efficiency achieved here shine a new light on the future of the CZTSSe solar cell.

&lt;p&gt;As a low-cost substitute that uses no expensive rare-earth elements for the high-efficiency Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; solar cell, the Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ZnSn(S,Se)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (CZTSSe) solar cell has borrowed optimization strategies used for its predecessor to improve its device performance, including a profiled band gap and surface inversion. Indeed, there have been few reports of constructing CZTSSe absorber layers with surface inversion to improve efficiency. Here, a strategy that designs the CZTSSe absorber to attain surface modification by using n-type Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ZnSnS&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is demonstrated. It has been discovered that Ag plays two major roles in the kesterite thin film devices: surface inversion and front gradient distribution. It has not only an excellent carrier transport effect and reduced probability of electron-hole recombination but also results in increased carrier separation by increasing the width of the depletion region, leading to much improved &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;SC&lt;/sub&gt;. Finally, a champion CZTSSe solar cell renders efficiency as high as 12.55%, one of the highest for its type, with the open-circuit voltage deficit reduced to as low as 0.306&#160;V (63.2% Shockley-Queisser limit). The band engineering for surface modification of the absorber and high efficiency achieved here shine a new light on the future of the CZTSSe solar cell.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multifunctional Macroassembled Graphene Nanofilms with High Crystallinity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly crystalline macroassembled graphene nanofilms prepared by a camphor&#8208;assisted cooling&#8211;contraction strategy show excellent physical properties and advantages in high&#8208;performance electronic and optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
A &#8220;cooling&#8211;contraction&#8221; method to separate large&#8208;area (up to 4.2&#160;cm in lateral size) graphene oxide (GO)&#8208;assembled films (of nanoscale thickness) from substrates is reported. Heat treatment at 3000&#160;&#176;C of such free&#8208;standing macroscale films yields highly crystalline &#8220;macroassembled graphene nanofilms&#8221; (nMAGs) with 16&#8211;48&#160;nm thickness. These nMAGs present tensile strength of 5.5&#8211;11.3&#160;GPa (with &#8776;3&#160;&#181;m gauge length), electrical conductivity of 1.8&#8211;2.1 MS m&#8722;1, thermal conductivity of 2027&#8211;2820 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1, and carrier relaxation time up to &#8776;23&#160;ps. As a demonstration application, an nMAG&#8208;based sound&#8208;generator shows a 30 &#181;s response and sound pressure level of 89&#160;dB at 1 W cm&#8722;2. A THz metasurface fabricated from nMAG has a light response of 8.2% for 0.159 W mm&#8722;2 and can detect down to 0.01&#160;ppm of glucose. The approach provides a straightforward way to form highly crystallized graphene nanofilms from low&#8208;cost GO sheets.

         <title>Conductive CuCo&#8208;Based Bimetal Organic Framework for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conductive bimetal&#8208;based catecholate (CAT) nanorod arrays show excellent hydrogen evolution reaction activities in both alkaline and neutral electrolyte, comparable to that of the benchmark Pt/C. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the incorporation of Co not only optimizes the &#916;GH* and the adsorption energy of water (&#916;EH2O) of Cu&#8208;CAT, but also increases the electrical conductivity of Cu&#8208;CAT.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with intrinsically porous structures and well&#8208;dispersed metal sites are promising candidates for electrocatalysis; however, the catalytic efficiencies of most MOFs are significantly limited by their impertinent adsorption/desorption energy of intermediates formed during electrocatalysis and very low electrical conductivity. Herein, Co is introduced into conductive Cu&#8208;catecholate (Cu&#8208;CAT) nanorod arrays directly grown on a flexible carbon cloth for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Electrochemical results show that the Co&#8208;incorporated Cu&#8208;CAT nanorod arrays only need 52 and 143&#160;mV overpotentials to drive a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in alkaline and neutral media for HER, respectively, much lower than most of the reported non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts and comparable to the benchmark Pt/C electrocatalyst. Density functional theory calculations show that the introduction of Co can optimize the adsorption energy of hydrogen (&#916;GH*) of Cu sites, almost close to that of Pt (111). Furthermore, the adsorption energy of water (&#916;EH2O) of Co sites in the CuCo&#8208;CAT is significantly lower than that of Cu sites upon coupling Cu with Co, effectively accelerating the Volmer step in the HER process. The findings, synergistic effect of bimetals, open a new avenue for the rational design of highly efficient MOF&#8208;based electrocatalysts.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Co2&#8211;N6 and Fe&#8211;N4 Costructures Boost Oxygen Reduction Reaction in Both Alkaline and Acidic Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ternary&#8208;atom electrocatalyst, in which atomically dispersed Co2&#8211;N6 and Fe&#8211;N4 sites are coanchored on N&#8208;doped carbon hosts (derived from reaction with ZIF&#8208;8), is synthesized. Synergistic effect is explicitly unraveled, which induces higher filling degree of Fe d&#8208;orbitals and outstanding oxygen reduction reaction activity in both alkaline and acidic media.








Abstract
Polynary transition&#8208;metal atom catalysts are promising to supersede platinum (Pt)&#8208;based catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Regulating the local configuration of atomic catalysts is the key to catalyst performance enhancement. Different from the previously reported single&#8208;atom or dual&#8208;atom configurations, a new type of ternary&#8208;atom catalyst, which consists of atomically dispersed, nitrogen&#8208;coordinated Co&#8211;Co dimers, and Fe single sites (i.e., Co2&#8211;N6 and Fe&#8211;N4 structures) that are coanchored on highly graphitized carbon supports is developed. This unique atomic ORR catalyst outperforms the catalysts with only Co2&#8211;N6 or Fe&#8211;N4 sites in both alkaline and acid conditions. Density functional theory calculations clearly unravels the synergistic effect of the Co2&#8211;N6 and Fe&#8211;N4 sites, which can induce higher filling degree of Fe&#8211;d orbitals and favors the binding capability to *OH intermediates (the rate determining step). This ternary&#8208;atom catalyst may be a promising alternative to Pt to drive the cathodic ORR in zinc&#8211;air batteries.

         <title>Self&#8208;Powered InP Nanowire Photodetector for Single&#8208;Photon Level Detection at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;powered InP nanowire array photodetector that can achieve single&#8208;photon&#8208;level light detection at room temperature without an external bias is reported. This is enabled by an optimized radial p&#8211;n heterojunction nanowire array design to realize near&#8208;ideal broadband absorption, extremely low dark current, and highly efficient charge carrier separation.








Abstract
Highly sensitive photodetectors with single&#8208;photon level detection are one of the key components to a range of emerging technologies, in particular the ever&#8208;growing field of optical communication, remote sensing, and quantum computing. Currently, most of the single&#8208;photon detection technologies require external biasing at high voltages and/or cooling to low temperatures, posing great limitations for wider applications. Here, InP nanowire array photodetectors that can achieve single&#8208;photon level light detection at room temperature without an external bias are demonstrated. Top&#8208;down etched, heavily doped p&#8208;type InP nanowires and n&#8208;type aluminium&#8208;doped zinc oxide (AZO)/zinc oxide (ZnO) carrier&#8208;selective contact are used to form a radial p&#8211;n junction with a built&#8208;in electric field exceeding 3 &#215; 105&#160;V cm&#8722;1&#160;at 0&#160;V. The device exhibits broadband light sensitivity and can distinguish a single photon per pulse from the dark noise at 0&#160;V, enabled by its design to realize near&#8208;ideal broadband absorption, extremely low dark current, and highly efficient charge carrier separation. Meanwhile, the bandwidth of the device reaches above 600&#160;MHz with a timing jitter of 538&#160;ps. The proposed device design provides a new pathway toward low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;sensitivity, self&#8208;powered photodetectors for numerous future applications.

Here, InP nanowire array photodetectors that can achieve single-photon level light detection at room temperature without an external bias are demonstrated. Top-down etched, heavily doped p-type InP nanowires and n-type aluminium-doped zinc oxide (AZO)/zinc oxide (ZnO) carrier-selective contact are used to form a radial p&#8211;n junction with a built-in electric field exceeding 3 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;V cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;at 0&#160;V. The device exhibits broadband light sensitivity and can distinguish a single photon per pulse from the dark noise at 0&#160;V, enabled by its design to realize near-ideal broadband absorption, extremely low dark current, and highly efficient charge carrier separation. Meanwhile, the bandwidth of the device reaches above 600&#160;MHz with a timing jitter of 538&#160;ps. The proposed device design provides a new pathway toward low-cost, high-sensitivity, self-powered photodetectors for numerous future applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synergistic Enzyme Mixtures to Realize Near&#8208;Complete Depolymerization in Biodegradable Polymer/Additive Blends</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
When enzymes with deep, narrow active sites are embedded inside of plastics, chain&#8208;end&#8208;mediated processive depolymerization is realized. However, polymer additives can induce bending in crystalline lamellae, which causes chain ends to preferentially segregate at the crystal/amorphous interface where they are inaccessible for enzyme binding. Synergistic enzyme mechanisms can be exploited to create new chain ends and facilitate near&#8208;complete depolymerization.








Abstract
Embedding catalysts inside of plastics affords accelerated chemical modification with programmable latency and pathways. Nanoscopically embedded enzymes can lead to near&#8208;complete degradation of polyesters via chain&#8208;end mediated processive depolymerization. The overall degradation rate and pathways have a strong dependence on the morphology of semicrystalline polyesters. Yet, most studies to date focus on pristine polymers instead of mixtures that contain additives and other components despite their nearly universal use in plastic production. Here, additives are introduced to purposely change the morphology of polycaprolactone (PCL) by increasing the bending and twisting of crystalline lamellae. These morphological changes immobilize chain ends preferentially at the crystalline/amorphous interfaces and limit chain&#8208;end accessibility by the embedded processive enzyme. This chain&#8208;end redistribution reduces the polymer&#8208;to&#8208;monomer conversion from &gt;95%&#160;to less than 50%, causing formation of highly crystalline plastic pieces, including microplastics. By synergizing both random chain scission and processive depolymerization, it is feasible to navigate morphological changes in polymer/additive blends and to achieve near&#8208;complete depolymerization. The random scission enzymes in the amorphous domains create new chain ends that are subsequently bound and depolymerized by processive enzymes. Present studies further highlight the importance to consider how the host polymer's morphologies affect the reactions catalyzed by embedded catalytic species.

         <title>Physical Disruption of Solid Tumors by Immunostimulatory Microrobots Enhances Antitumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Micromotors coated with bacterial membrane are utilized for combinatorial cancer therapy. Upon intratumoral administration, the micromotors induce irreversible physical damage to the tumor tissue, while the immunostimulatory membrane recruits host immune cells to process tumor antigens in situ. Treatment of solid tumors using this platform results in robust antitumor immunity that can also control the growth of distant secondary tumors.








Abstract
The combination of immunotherapy with other forms of treatment is an emerging strategy for boosting antitumor responses. By combining multiple modes of action, these combinatorial therapies can improve clinical outcomes through unique synergisms. Here, a microrobot&#8208;based strategy that integrates tumor tissue disruption with biological stimulation is shown for cancer immunotherapy. The microrobot is fabricated by loading bacterial outer membrane vesicles onto a self&#8208;propelling micromotor, which can react with water to generate a propulsion force. When administered intratumorally to a solid tumor, the disruption of the local tumor tissue coupled with the delivery of an immunostimulatory payload leads to complete tumor regression. Additionally, treatment of the primary tumor results in the simultaneous education of the host immune system, enabling it to control the growth of distant tumors. Overall, this work introduces a distinct application of microrobots in cancer immunotherapy and offers an attractive strategy for amplifying cancer treatment efficacy when combined with conventional therapies.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Dependent Intermediate Adsorption Modulation on Iridium&#8208;Modified Black Phosphorus Electrocatalysts for Efficient pH&#8208;Universal Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient iridium&#8208;modified 2D black phosphorus electrocatalyst is rationally designed to achieve the desired adsorption energies toward catalytic intermediates, and the resultant catalyst demonstrates outstanding pH&#8208;universal water splitting performances, surpassing the commercially dominating catalysts. Furthermore, an interesting surface&#8208;dependent activity enhancement mechanism is identified.








Abstract
2D black phosphorus (BP) is one promising electrocatalyst toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysis. The too strong adsorption of oxygen intermediates during OER, while the too weak adsorption of hydrogen intermediate during HER, however, greatly compromise its practical water splitting applications with overpotentials as high as 450&#160;mV for OER and 420&#160;mV for HER to achieve 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 under alkaline conditions. Herein, by rationally introducing the nanosized iridium (Ir) modifier together with optimized exposing surface toward electrolytes, an efficient Ir&#8208;modified BP electrocatalyst with much favorable adsorption energies toward catalytic intermediates possesses an outstanding pH&#8208;universal water splitting performance, surpassing the nearly all reported BP&#8208;based catalysts and the commercial noble&#8208;metal catalysts. The Ir&#8208;modified BP catalyst with the optimized exposed surfaces only requires an overall cell voltage of 1.54 and 1.57&#160;V to achieve 10 mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in acidic and alkaline electrolysers, respectively. This design uncovers the potential applications of 2D BP in practical electrocatalysis fields via decreasing reaction intermediate adsorption energy barriers and promoting the interfacial electron coupling for heterostructured catalysts, and offers new insights into the surface&#8208;dependent activity enhancement mechanism.

         <title>Fluorescent Nanozeolite Receptors for the Highly Selective and Sensitive Detection of Neurotransmitters in Water and Biofluids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent artificial receptors that bind neurotransmitters with unprecedented affinity and selectivity in biofluids are introduced. They are based on nanozeolite hybrid materials and can be used for emission&#8208; and absorbance&#8208;based detection of serotonin and dopamine in urine at physiological relevant concentration, for (two&#8208;photon) imaging, and for label&#8208;free enzymatic reaction monitoring in real time.








Abstract
The design and preparation of synthetic binders (SBs) applicable for small biomolecule sensing in aqueous media remains very challenging. SBs designed by the lock&#8208;and&#8208;key principle can be selective for their target analyte but usually show an insufficient binding strength in water. In contrast, SBs based on symmetric macrocycles with a hydrophobic cavity can display high binding affinities but generally suffer from indiscriminate binding of many analytes. Herein, a completely new and modular receptor design strategy based on microporous hybrid materials is presented yielding zeolite&#8208;based artificial receptors (ZARs) which reversibly bind the neurotransmitters serotonin and dopamine with unprecedented affinity and selectivity even in saline biofluids. ZARs are thought to uniquely exploit both the non&#8208;classical hydrophobic effect and direct non&#8208;covalent recognition motifs, which is supported by in&#8208;depth photophysical, and calorimetric experiments combined with full atomistic modeling. ZARs are thermally and chemically robust and can be readily prepared at gram scales. Their applicability for the label&#8208;free monitoring of important enzymatic reactions, for (two&#8208;photon) fluorescence imaging, and for high&#8208;throughput diagnostics in biofluids is demonstrated. This study showcases that artificial receptor based on microporous hybrid materials can overcome standing limitations of synthetic chemosensors, paving the way towards personalized diagnostics and metabolomics.

         <dc:description>
There is a strong interest in developing phase&#8208;controlled metal nanocrystals to enhance their catalytic activity. In this work, template&#8208;directed growth is used to synthesize Ru@Pd nanocrystals with the Pd shells in either an fcc or hcp phase, and their catalytic properties are compared.








Abstract
A relatively unexplored aspect of noble&#8208;metal nanomaterials is polymorphism, or their ability to crystallize in different crystal phases. Here, a method is reported for the facile synthesis of Ru@Pd core&#8211;shell nanocrystals featuring polymorphism, with the core made of hexagonally close&#8208;packed (hcp)&#8208;Ru while the Pd shell takes either an hcp or face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) phase. The polymorphism shows a dependence on the shell thickness, with shells thinner than &#8776;1.4&#160;nm taking the hcp phase whereas the thicker ones revert to fcc. The injection rate provides an experimental knob for controlling the phase, with one&#8208;shot and drop&#8208;wise injection of the Pd precursor corresponding to fcc&#8208;Pd and hcp&#8208;Pd shells, respectively. When these nanocrystals are tested as catalysts toward formic acid oxidation, the Ru@Pdhcp nanocrystals outperform Ru@Pdfcc in terms of both specific activity and peak potential. Density functional theory calculations are also performed to elucidate the origin of this performance enhancement.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Carbon Superstructures Achieving Ultra&#8208;Stable and Fast Proton&#8208;Coupled Charge Storage Kinetics</title>

Complementary acceptor&#8211;donor molecules of 2,4,6&#8208;trichloro&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine and 2,6&#8208;diaminoanthraquinone form a porous organic polymer with &#8220;protic salt&#8221;&#8208;type rigid skeleton linked by &#8722;NH2+Cl&#8722;&#8722; &#8220;rivets&#8221;, which offers the cornerstone for H&#8208;bonding self&#8208;assembly of the organic backbone to carbon superstructures by &#960;&#8722;&#960; plane stacking. The superstructures achieve ultrastable and fast proton&#8208;coupled charge storage kinetics, giving unprecedented lifespan (1&#160;000&#160;000 cycles) and high energy density for carbon (zinc) supercapacitors.








Abstract
Designing ingenious and stable carbon nanostructures is critical but still challenging for use in energy storage devices with superior electrochemistry kinetics, durable capacitive activity, and high rate survivability. To pursue the objective, a simple self&#8208;assembly strategy is developed to access carbon superstructures built of nanoparticle embedded plates. The carbon precursors, 2,4,6&#8208;trichloro&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine and 2,6&#8208;diaminoanthraquinone can form porous organic polymer with &#8220;protic salt&#8221;&#8208;type rigid skeleton linked by &#8722;NH2+Cl&#8722;&#8722; &#8220;rivets&#8221;, which provides the cornerstone for hydrogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;guided self&#8208;assembly of the organic backbone to superstructures by &#960;&#8722;&#960; plane stacking. The ameliorative charge density distribution and decreased adsorption energy in as&#8208;fabricated carbon superstructures allow the high accessibility of the build&#8208;in protophilic sites and efficient ion diffusion with a low energy barrier. Such superstructures thus deliver ultra&#8208;stable charge storage and fast proton&#8208;coupled kinetics at the structural&#8722;chemical defects, contributing to unprecedented lifespan (1&#160;000&#160;000 cycles), high&#8208;rate capability (100 A g&#8722;1) for carbon&#8208;based supercapacitors, and an ultrahigh energy density (128&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1) for Zn&#8208;ion hybrid supercapacitors. The self&#8208;assembled carbon superstructures significantly improve the all&#8208;round electrochemical performances, and hold great promise for efficient energy storage.

         <title>A Regioselectively Oxidized 2D Bi/BiOx Lateral Nano&#8208;Heterostructure for Hypoxic Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bismuthene/bismuth oxide (Bi/BiOx)&#8208;based lateral nano&#8208;heterostructure is fabricated to effectively generate 1O2 under normoxia but produce cytotoxic &#8226;OH and H2 under hypoxia, which synergistically enhances photodynamic therapy. Furthermore, this Bi/BiOx nano&#8208;heterostructure is biocompatible and biodegradable, and, with surface molecular engineering, it improves tumor tissue penetration and increases cellular uptake, yielding excellent oxygen&#8208;independent tumor ablation.








Abstract
Optoelectronic science and 2D nanomaterial technologies are currently at the forefront of multidisciplinary research and have numerous applications in electronics and photonics. The unique energy and optically induced interfacial electron transfer in these nanomaterials, enabled by their relative band alignment characteristics, can provide important therapeutic modalities for healthcare. Given that nano&#8208;heterostructures can facilitate photoinduced electron&#8211;hole separation and enhance generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), 2D nano&#8208;heterostructure&#8208;based photosensitizers can provide a major advancement in photodynamic therapy (PDT), to overcome the current limitations in hypoxic tumor microenvironments. Herein, a bismuthene/bismuth oxide (Bi/BiOx)&#8208;based lateral nano&#8208;heterostructure synthesized using a regioselective oxidation process is introduced, which, upon irradiation at 660&#160;nm, effectively generates 1O2 under normoxia but produces cytotoxic &#8226;OH and H2 under hypoxia, which synergistically enhances PDT. Furthermore, this Bi/BiOx nano&#8208;heterostructure is biocompatible and biodegradable, and, with the surface molecular engineering used here, it improves tumor tissue penetration and increases cellular uptake during in vitro and in vivo experiments, yielding excellent oxygen&#8208;independent tumor ablation with 660&#160;nm irradiation, when compared with traditional PDT agents.

Gradient alloyed CdSe/ZnxCd1&#8722;xS/ZnS and CdSe/CdS/ZnS core/shell/shell quantum&#8208;rod downconverters showing high&#8208;efficacy light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) covering a wide color gamut are reported. The engineered shell thickness suppresses energy transfer and Auger recombination and maintains the high quantum yield in the solid&#8208;state (81%). These LEDs show luminous efficacy of 149&#160;lm&#160;W&#8722;1 and wide color gamut.








Abstract
Efficient white light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) with an efficacy of 200&#160;lm&#160;W&#8722;1 are much desirable for lighting and displays. The phosphor&#8208;based LEDs in use today for display applications offer poor color saturation. Intensive efforts have been made to replace the phosphor with quantum&#8208;dot&#8208;based downconverters, but the efficiency and stability of these devices are still in their infancy. Quantum rods (QRs), nanoparticles with an elongated shape, show superior properties such as relatively larger Stokes shifts, polarized emission, and high light out&#8208;coupling efficiency in the solid&#8208;state. However, these QRs usually suffer from poor optical quality for PL wavelengths &lt;&#160;550&#160;nm. Herein, a gradient alloyed CdSe/ZnxCd1&#8722;xS/ZnS and CdSe/CdS/ZnS core/shell/shell QR downconverters showing high efficacy LEDs covering a wide color gamut are reported. These QRs show high stability and a precisely tunable photoluminescence peak. The engineered shell thickness suppresses energy transfer and thus maintains the high quantum yield in the solid&#8208;state (81%). These QR&#8208;based LEDs attain an efficacy of 149&#160;lm&#160;W&#8722;1 (@10mA) and&#160;wide color gamut (118% NTSC), which is exceedingly higher than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art quantum dots and phosphor&#8208;based on&#8208;chip LEDs.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Single&#8208;Atom Tailoring with Bifunctional Integration for High&#8208;Performance CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co&#8211;Ru dual&#8208;atoms inside conjugated porous carbon nitride polymer are designed for regulation of outstanding synergistic photocatalysis during light&#8208;driven CO2 conversion, of which the bifunctionalized Co&#8211;Ru sites feature atom&#8208;specific functions with Co for dynamic carrier mobility and Ru for selective CO2 surface&#8208;bound interaction.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom photocatalysis has been demonstrated as a novel strategy to promote heterogeneous reactions. There is a diversity of monoatomic metal species with specific functions; however, integrating representative merits into dual&#8208;single&#8208;atoms and regulating cooperative photocatalysis remain a pressing challenge. For dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom catalysts, enhanced photocatalytic activity would be realized through integrating bifunctional properties and tuning the synergistic effect. Herein, dual&#8208;single&#8208;atoms supported on conjugated porous carbon nitride polymer are developed for effective photocatalytic CO2 reduction, featuring the function of cobalt (Co) and ruthenium (Ru). A series of in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations are conducted for quantitative analysis of structure&#8211;performance correlation. It is concluded that the active Co sites facilitate dynamic charge transfer, while the Ru sites promote selective CO2 surface&#8208;bound interaction during CO2 photoreduction. The combination of atom&#8208;specific traits and the synergy between Co and Ru lead to the high photocatalytic CO2 conversion with corresponding apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 2.8% at 385&#160;nm, along with a high turnover number (TON) of more than 200 without addition of any sacrificial agent. This work presents an example of identifying the roles of different single&#8208;atom metals and regulating the synergy, where the two metals with unique properties collaborate to further boost the photocatalytic performance.

         <title>Fe&#8208;Ion Bolted VOPO4&#8729;2H2O as an Aqueous Fe&#8208;Ion Battery Electrode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron&#8208;ion batteries are promising for grid energy storage due to their low cost and compatibility with aqueous electrolytes. This work demonstrates vanadium oxyphosphate as a capable cathode to host Fe2+. Vanadium oxyphosphate exhibits structural stability favoring Fe2+ to Zn2+ due to the bolting effect by the pre&#8208;intercalated Fe3+ before battery cycling.








Abstract
Iron ion batteries using Fe2+ as a charge carrier have yet to be widely explored, and they lack high&#8208;performing Fe2+ hosting cathode materials to couple with the iron metal anode. Here, it is demonstrated that VOPO4&#8729;2H2O can reversibly host Fe2+ with a high specific capacity of 100 mAh g&#8722;1 and stable cycling performance, where 68% of the initial capacity is retained over 800 cycles. In sharp contrast, VOPO4&#8729;2H2O's capacity of hosting Zn2+ fades precipitously over tens of cycles. VOPO4&#8729;2H2O stores Fe2+ with a unique mechanism, where upon contacting the electrolyte by the VOPO4&#8729;2H2O electrode, Fe2+ ions from the electrolyte get oxidized to Fe3+ ions that are inserted and trapped in the VOPO4&#8729;2H2O structure in an electroless redox reaction. The trapped Fe3+ ions, thus, bolt the layered structure of VOPO4&#8729;2H2O, which prevents it from dissolution into the electrolyte during (de)insertion of Fe2+. The findings offer a new strategy to use a redox&#8208;active ion charge carrier to stabilize the layered electrode materials.

         <title>Towards High Performance Li&#8211;S Batteries via Sulfonate&#8208;Rich COF&#8208;Modified Separator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An all&#8208;in&#8208;one strategy of a sulfonate&#8208;rich covalent organic framework (COF)&#8208;modified separator is proposed for Li&#8211;S batteries, which provides a solution for tackling the issues of polysulfide shuttling and dendrite growth simultaneously. Benefiting from the chemical merits of strong electronegativity and large interlayer spacing for SCOF&#8208;2, the capacity and stability of rechargeable Li&#8211;S batteries are greatly improved.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries are held great promise for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density devices; however, polysulfide shuttle and Li&#8208;dendrite growth severely hinders their commercial production. Herein, a sulfonate&#8208;rich COF (SCOF&#8208;2) is designed, synthesized, and used to modify the separator of Li&#8211;S batteries, providing a solution for the above challenges. It is found that the SCOF&#8208;2 features stronger electronegativity and larger interlayer spacing than that of none/monosulfonate COFs, which can facilitate the Li+ migration and alleviate the formation of Li&#8208;dendrites. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and in situ Raman analysis demonstrate that the SCOF&#8208;2 possesses a narrow bandgap and strong interaction on sulfur species, thereby suppressing self&#8208;discharge behavior. As a result, the modified batteries deliver an ultralow attenuation rate of 0.047% per cycle over 800 cycles at 1 C, and excellent anti&#8208;self&#8208;discharge performance by a low&#8208;capacity attenuation of 6.0% over one week. Additionally, even with the high&#8208;sulfur&#8208;loading cathode (3.2&#8211;8.2 mgs cm&#8208;2) and lean electrolyte (5&#160;&#181;L&#160;mgs&#8208;1), the batteries still exhibit &#8776;80% capacity retention over 100 cycles, showing great potential for practical application.

         <title>Enzymatically Transformable Polymersome&#8208;Based Nanotherapeutics to Eliminate Minimal Relapsable Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzymatically transformable nanotherapeutics is presented to improve the targeted delivery of old drugs&#8212;MMP inhibitor and colchicine&#8212;into minimal relapsable cancer. This distinct combination therapy not only ensures direct killing of residual cancer cells but also disrupts the premetastatic microenvironment to prevent distant seeding/outgrowth, which radically reduces metastatic and local&#8208;regional recurrence after surgery.








Abstract
Prevention of metastatic and local&#8208;regional recurrence of cancer after surgery remains difficult. Targeting postsurgical premetastatic niche and microresiduals presents an excellent prospective opportunity but is often challenged by poor therapeutic delivery into minimal residual tumors. Here, an enzymatically transformable polymer&#8208;based nanotherapeutic approach is presented that exploits matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) overactivation in tumor&#8208;associated tissues to guide the codelivery of colchicine (microtubule&#8208;disrupting and anti&#8208;inflammatory agent) and marimastat (MMP inhibitor). The dePEGylation of polymersomes catalyzed by MMPs not only exposes the guanidine moiety to improve tissue/cell&#8208;targeting/retention to increase bioavailability, but also differentially releases marimastat and colchicine to engage their extracellular (MMPs) and intracellular (microtubules) targets of action, respectively. In primary tumors/overt metastases, the vasculature&#8208;specific targeting of nanotherapeutics can function synchronously with the enhanced permeability and retention effect to deter malignant progression of metastatic breast cancer. After the surgical removal of large primary tumors, nanotherapeutic agents are localized in the premetastatic niche and at the site of the postsurgical wound, disrupting the premetastatic microenvironment and eliminating microresiduals, which radically reduces metastatic and local&#8208;regional recurrence. The findings suggest that nanotherapeutics can safely widen the therapeutic window to resuscitate colchicine and MMP inhibitors for other inflammatory disorders.

         <title>Engineering Extracellular Vesicles Enriched with Palmitoylated ACE2 as COVID&#8208;19 Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineered EVs enriched with palmitoylated ACE2 (PM&#8208;ACE2) efficiently capture SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 viruses and block their interaction with the cell surface ACE2, leading to reduced infection both in vitro and in vivo. This work identifies a novel palmitoylation&#8208;dependent mechanism whereby human cells package ACE2 into EVs, meanwhile developing PM&#8208;ACE2&#8208;EVs as a novel candidate for prophylactic and therapeutic treatment against COVID&#8208;19.








Abstract
Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a key receptor present on cell surfaces that directly interacts with the viral spike (S) protein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus&#8208;2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2). It is proposed that inhibiting this interaction can be promising in treating COVID&#8208;19. Here, the presence of ACE2 in extracellular vesicles (EVs) is reported and the EV&#8208;ACE2 levels are determined by protein palmitoylation. The Cys141 and Cys498 residues on ACE2 are S&#8208;palmitoylated by zinc finger DHHC&#8208;Type Palmitoyltransferase 3 (ZDHHC3) and de&#8208;palmitoylated by acyl protein thioesterase 1 (LYPLA1), which is critical for the membrane&#8208;targeting of ACE2 and their EV secretion. Importantly, by fusing the S&#8208;palmitoylation&#8208;dependent plasma membrane (PM) targeting sequence with ACE2, EVs enriched with ACE2 on their surface (referred to as PM&#8208;ACE2&#8208;EVs) are engineered. It is shown that PM&#8208;ACE2&#8208;EVs can bind to the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 S&#8208;RBD with high affinity and block its interaction with cell surface ACE2 in vitro. PM&#8208;ACE2&#8208;EVs show neutralization potency against pseudotyped and authentic SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 in human ACE2 (hACE2) transgenic mice, efficiently block viral load of authentic SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, and thus protect host against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8208;induced lung inflammation. The study provides an efficient engineering protocol for constructing a promising, novel biomaterial for application in prophylactic and therapeutic treatments against COVID&#8208;19.

         <title>Self&#8208;Supporting 3D Carbon Nitride with Tunable n &#8594; &#960;* Electronic Transition for Enhanced Solar Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;supporting 3D (SSD) polymeric carbon nitride (PCN), with tunable n &#8594; &#960;* electronic transition, is successfully synthesized via a facile stepwise pyrolytic strategy. The synergistic optimization of the SSD structure and n &#8594; &#960;* electronic transition in PCN significantly advance the exciton dissociation and optical absorption, leading to enhanced visible&#8208;light H2 evolution activity in the spectral region above 500&#160;nm.








Abstract
Self&#8208;supporting 3D (SSD) carbon nitrides (UCN&#8208;X, X&#160;= 600&#8211;690; where X represents the pyrolytic temperature) consisting of curved layers, with plenty of wrinkles and enlarged size, are synthesized via a facile stepwise pyrolytic strategy. Such unique features of the SSD structure exhibiting dramatically improved charge mobility, extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated aromatic system, and partial distortion of heptazine&#8208;based skeleton can not only keep the easier activation of the intrinsic &#960;&#160;&#8594; &#160;&#960;* electronic transition but also awaken the n &#8594; &#960;* electronic transition in carbon nitride. The n &#8594; &#960;* electronic transition of UCN&#8208;X can be controllably tuned through changing the pyrolytic temperature, which can greatly extend the photoresponse range to 600&#160;nm. More importantly, the change regularity of H2 evolution rates is highly positive, correlated with the change tendency of n &#8594; &#960;* electronic transition in UCN&#8208;X, suggesting the positive contribution of n &#8594; &#960;* electronic transition to enhancing photocatalytic activity. The UCN&#8208;670, with optimal structural and optical properties, presents enhanced H2 evolution rate up to 9230&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 (Pt 1.1 wt%). This work realizes the synergistic optimization of optical absorption and exciton dissociation via fabricating an SSD structure. It offers a new strategy for the development of novel carbon nitride materials for efficient photocatalytic reactions.

         <title>Spacer Cation Alloying in Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Perovskites for Efficient Red Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Precisely Tunable Wavelengths</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and general strategy of spacer cation alloying is developed to modulate the thickness distribution of quantum wells in Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskite films. Based on this method, efficient perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes with tunable emissions between pure red (626&#160;nm) and deep red (671&#160;nm) are achieved with peak external quantum efficiencies up to 11.5%.








Abstract
Perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) have recently shown significant progress with external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) exceeding 20%. However, PeLEDs with pure&#8208;red (620&#8722;660&#160;nm) light emission, an essential part for full&#8208;color displays, remain a great challenge. Herein, a general approach of spacer cation alloying is employed in Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskites (RPPs) for efficient red PeLEDs with precisely tunable wavelengths. By simply tuning the alloying ratio of dual spacer cations, the thickness distribution of quantum wells in the RPP films can be precisely modulated without deteriorating their charge&#8208;transport ability and energy funneling processes. Consequently, efficient PeLEDs with tunable emissions between pure red (626&#160;nm) and deep red (671&#160;nm) are achieved with peak EQEs up to 11.5%, representing the highest values among RPP&#8208;based pure&#8208;red PeLEDs. This work opens a new route for color tuning, which will spur future developments of pure&#8208;red or even pure&#8208;blue PeLEDs with high performance.

         <title>Ultrafast Thermal Imprinting of Plasmonic Hotspots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Plasmonic heating ordinarily leads to isotropic heating of the material. However, through nanoparticle shaping, pulsed illumination, and the right choice of material (e.g., HfN), plasmonic absorption hotspots can be directly imprinted on the lattice as heat. This approach results in extreme thermal hotspots, lasting hundreds of picoseconds, which can boost the chemical reactivity of catalytic nanoreactors by orders of magnitude.








Abstract
Plasmonic photochemistry is driven by a rich collection of near&#8208;field, hot charge carrier, energy transfer, and thermal effects, most often accomplished by continuous wave illumination. Heat generation is usually considered undesirable, because noble metal nanoparticles heat up isotropically, losing the extreme energy confinement of the optical resonance. Here it is demonstrated through optical and heat&#8208;transfer modelling that the judicious choice of nanoreactor geometry and material enables the direct thermal imprint of plasmonic optical absorption hotspots onto the lattice with high fidelity. Transition metal nitrides (TMNs, e.g., TiN/HfN) embody the ideal material requirements, where ultrafast electron&#8211;phonon coupling prevents fast electronic heat dissipation and low thermal conductivity prolongs the heat confinement. The extreme energy confinement leads to unprecedented peak temperatures and internal heat gradients (&gt;10 K nm&#8722;1) that cannot be achieved using noble metals or any current heating method. TMN nanoreactors consequently yield up to ten thousand times more product in pulsed photothermal chemical conversion compared with noble metals (Ag, Au, Cu). These findings open up a completely unexplored realm of nano&#8208;photochemistry, where adjacent reaction centers experience substantially different temperatures for hundreds of picoseconds, long enough for bond breaking to occur.

Cancer Therapy
In article number 2104037, Xiang Li, Zhen Gu, Xiujun Cai, and co&#8208;workers report that the generated H2S and released zinc ions from ZnS@BSA nanoclusters promote accumulation of reactive oxygen species to activate cGAS/STING signals in tumor cells. ZnS@BSA nanoclusters are further demonstrated to facilitate antitumor immunotherapy by immune cell infiltration, showing potential for clinical translation.

Detection of Neurotransmitters
So far, only modestly performing synthetic binders have been accessible for small bioactive molecules such as serotonin and dopamine. In article number 2104614, Luisa De Cola, Frank Biedermann, and co&#8208;workers introduce zeolite&#8208;based artificial receptors (ZARs), which are microporous inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid materials applicable for the optical&#8208;based detection of serotonin and dopamine in urine at physiological relevant concentrations. These ZARs outperform protein receptors with respect to response times, robustness and scalability.

Organic Electrochemical Transistors
Among other merits, the ability of organic electrochemical transistors to form an intimate interface with a biological environment, enabling efficient ion&#8208;to&#8208;electron transduction, makes them particularly desirable for operation within a living organism (in vivo). In article number 2101874, Ali Nawaz, Prashant Sonar, and co&#8208;workers comprehensively review the wide range of in vivo bioelectronic applications that have been addressed for organic electrochemical transistor technology and discuss the future challenges in the field.

COVID&#8208;19 Therapy
In their work reported in article number 2103471, Long Zhang, Fangfang Zhou, and co&#8208;workers fuse the S&#8208;palmitoylation&#8208;dependent plasma membrane (PM) targeting sequence with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and engineer extracellular vesicles (EVs) on their surface enriched with palmitoylated ACE2 (PM&#8208;ACE2&#8208;EVs). The PM&#8208;ACE2&#8208;EVs can bind to the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 S&#8208;RBD with high affinity and block its interaction with cell&#8208;surface ACE2, thereby preventing SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 from entering the host cell. This study provides a novel EV&#8208;based candidate for prophylactic and therapeutic treatment against COVID&#8208;19.

         <title>Nanophotonic Color Routing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoscale color routing is reviewed with a focus on the emerging concepts and the technology development trend, in particular for the applications in high&#8208;resolution imaging. Nanophotonic methods to manipulate light in both frequency&#8208;domain and spatial&#8208;domain with high&#8208;efficiency utilization of the full spectrum are presented. The remaining challenges and the potential solutions are also discussed.








Abstract
Recent advances in low&#8208;dimensional materials and nanofabrication technologies have stimulated many breakthroughs in the field of nanophotonics such as metamaterials and plasmonics that provide efficient ways of light manipulation at a subwavelength scale. The representative structure&#8208;induced spectral engineering techniques have demonstrated superior design of freedom compared with natural materials such as pigment/dye. In particular, the emerging spectral routing scheme enables extraordinary light manipulation in both frequency&#8208;domain and spatial&#8208;domain with high&#8208;efficiency utilization of the full spectrum, which is critically important for various applications and may open up entirely new operating paradigms. In this review, a comparative introduction on the operating mechanisms of spectral routing and spectral filtering schemes is given and recent progress on various color nanorouters based on metasurfaces, plasmonics, dielectric antennas is reviewed with a focus on the potential application in high&#8208;resolution imaging. With a thorough analysis and discussion on the advanced properties and drawbacks of various techniques, this report is expected to provide an overview and vision for the future development and application of nanophotonic color (spectral) routing techniques.

         <title>Carbon&#8208;Based Electrocatalysts for Efficient Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The latest advances in carbon&#8208;based hybrid catalysts toward hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production are reviewed. In particular, the design of functional groups and the dependence of electrolyte pH play important roles to further improve the selectivity of H2O2 production via the oxygen reduction reaction.








Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an environment&#8208;friendly and efficient oxidant with a wide range of applications in different industries. Recently, the production of hydrogen peroxide through direct electrosynthesis has attracted widespread research attention, and has emerged as the most promising method to replace the traditional energy&#8208;intensive multi&#8208;step anthraquinone process. In ongoing efforts to achieve highly efficient large&#8208;scale electrosynthesis of H2O2, carbon&#8208;based materials have been developed as 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction catalysts, with the benefits of low cost, abundant availability, and optimal performance. This review comprehensively introduces the strategies for optimizing carbon&#8208;based materials toward H2O2 production, and the latest advances in carbon&#8208;based hybrid catalysts. The active sites of the carbon&#8208;based materials and the influence of coordination heteroatom doping on the selectivity of H2O2 are extensively analyzed. In particular, the appropriate design of functional groups and understanding the effect of the electrolyte pH are expected to further improve the selective efficiency of producing H2O2 via the oxygen reduction reaction. Methods for improving catalytic activity by interface engineering and reaction kinetics are summarized. Finally, the challenges carbon&#8208;based catalysts face before they can be employed for commercial&#8208;scale H2O2 production are identified, and prospects for designing novel electrochemical reactors are proposed.

         <title>Emerging Technologies in Multi&#8208;Material Bioprinting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive overview of the available 3D bioprinting technologies for fabricating multi&#8208;material constructs is presented. The technologies are classified into four major categories, and their advantages and shortcomings are compared. Available multi&#8208;material commercial bioprinters are reviewed, concluding with a perspective of the future path for developing multi&#8208;material technologies.








Abstract
Bioprinting, within the emerging field of biofabrication, aims at the fabrication of functional biomimetic constructs. Different 3D bioprinting techniques have been adapted to bioprint cell&#8208;laden bioinks. However, single&#8208;material bioprinting techniques oftentimes fail to reproduce the complex compositions and diversity of native tissues. Multi&#8208;material bioprinting as an emerging approach enables the fabrication of heterogeneous multi&#8208;cellular constructs that replicate their host microenvironments better than single&#8208;material approaches. Here, bioprinting modalities are reviewed, their being adapted to multi&#8208;material bioprinting is discussed, and their advantages and challenges, encompassing both custom&#8208;designed and commercially available technologies are analyzed. A perspective of how multi&#8208;material bioprinting opens up new opportunities for tissue engineering, tissue model engineering, therapeutics development, and personalized medicine is offered.

         <title>Organic Electrochemical Transistors for In Vivo Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The role of organic electrochemical transistors in different in vivo bioelectronic applications, ranging from human electrophysiology to plant interfacing, is discussed. Particular emphasis is given on analyzing the key materials  design and device design aspects that make these devices ideal for addressing future in vivo biological systems. Finally, some challenges, limitations, and future applications are critically assessed.








Abstract
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are presently a focus of intense research and hold great potential in expanding the horizons of the bioelectronics industry. The notable characteristics of OECTs, including their electrolyte&#8208;gating, which offers intimate interfacing with biological environments, and aqueous stability, make them particularly suitable to be operated within a living organism (in vivo). Unlike the existing in vivo bioelectronic devices, mostly based on rigid metal electrodes, OECTs form a soft mechanical contact with the biological milieu and ensure a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio because of their powerful amplification capability. Such features make OECTs particularly desirable for a wide range of in vivo applications, including electrophysiological recordings, neuron stimulation, and neurotransmitter detection, and regulation of plant processes in vivo. In this review, a systematic compilation of the in vivo applications is presented that are addressed by the OECT technology. First, the operating mechanisms, and the device design and materials design principles of OECTs are examined, and then multiple examples are provided from the literature while identifying the unique device properties that enable the application progress. Finally, one critically looks at the future of the OECT technology for in vivo bioelectronic applications.

         <title>Controlled Vertically Aligned Structures in Polymer Composites: Natural Inspiration, Structural Processing, and Functional Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent progress in polymer composites with vertically oriented structures is summarized, with an emphasis on natural prototypes, processing methods, and multifunctional applications. Like the fairy tale, the Magpie bridge (processing methods) should be highlighted to connect the gap between the Weaver Girl (natural prototypes of vertical structures) and the Cowherd (functional polymeric composites) for close correlations from inspirations to implementations.








Abstract
Vertically aligned structures, which are a series of characteristic conformations with thickness&#8208;direction alignment, interconnection, or assembly of filler in polymeric composite materials that can provide remarkable structural performance and advanced anisotropic functions, have attracted considerable attention in recent years. The past two decades have witnessed extensive development with regard to universal fabrication methods, subtle control of morphological features, improvement of functional properties, and superior applications of vertically aligned structures in various fields. However, a systematic review remains to be attempted. The various configurations of vertical structures inspired from biological samples in nature, such as vertically aligned structures with honeycomb, reed, annual ring, radial, and lamellar configurations are summarized here. Additionally, relevant processing methods, which include the transformation of oriented direction, external&#8208;field inducement, template method, and 3D printing method, are discussed in detail. The diverse applications in mechanical, thermal, electric, dielectric, electromagnetic, water treatment, and energy fields are also highlighted by providing representative examples. Finally, future opportunities and prospects are listed to identify current issues and potential research directions. It is expected that perspectives on the vertically aligned structures presented here will contribute to the research on advanced multifunctional composites.

         <title>A Low&#8208;cost and Air&#8208;Stable Rechargeable Aluminum&#8208;Ion Battery</title>

Abstract
Rechargeable aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AIBs) are promising for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to the abundant reserve, low cost, and high capacity of Al anode. However, the development of AIBs is currently hindered by the usage of AlCl3/1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium chloride electrolyte, which is expensive, highly corrosive, and extremely air&#8208;sensitive. Herein, we report a new hydrated eutectic electrolyte (HEE) composed of hydrated aluminum perchlorate and succinonitrile for low&#8208;cost, non&#8208;corrosive, and air&#8208;stable AIBs. The crystal water in hydrated aluminum perchlorate plays a vital role in forming the HEE, in which one H2O and five SN and molecules coordinate with one Al3+ ion. The optimized ratio of Al(ClO4)3&#183;9H2O to succinonitrile is 1:12. When combining with the self&#8208;doped polyaniline cathode, the associated AIB delivers a high discharge capacity of 185 mAh g&#8211;1 over 300 cycles; the charge/discharge mechanism in the HEE was studied experimentally and theoretically. The HEE is non&#8208;flammable, air&#8208;stable, and non&#8208;corrosive, thus enabling good air tolerance and facile fabrication of AIBs.

         <title>Anisotropic Nodal&#8208;Line&#8208;Derived Large Anomalous Hall Conductivity in ZrMnP and HfMnP</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anomalous Hall conductivity appears in metallic ferromagnets due to the anomalous velocity of charge carriers in the presence of a magnetic field. In ferromagnets ZrMnP and HfMnP, the abundance of mirror planes forming nodal lines at the Fermi energy guides and enhances such velocity, resulting in both the compounds exhibiting large value of anomalous Hall conductivity.








Abstract
The nontrivial band structure of semimetals has attracted substantial research attention in condensed matter physics and materials science in recent years owing to its intriguing physical properties. Within this class, a group of nontrivial materials known as nodal&#8208;line semimetals is particularly important. Nodal&#8208;line semimetals exhibit the potential effects of electronic correlation in nonmagnetic materials, whereas they enhance the contribution of the Berry curvature in magnetic materials, resulting in high anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC). In this study, two ferromagnetic compounds, namely ZrMnP and HfMnP, are selected, wherein the abundance of mirror planes in the crystal structure ensures gapped nodal lines at the Fermi energy. These nodal lines result in one of the largest AHC values of 2840 &#937;&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1, with a high anomalous Hall angle of 13.6% in these compounds. First&#8208;principles calculations provide a clear and detailed understanding of nodal line&#8208;enhanced AHC. The finding suggests a guideline for searching large AHC compounds.

         <title>Atomic Structure Evolution of Pt&#8211;Co Binary Catalysts: Single Metal Sites versus Intermetallic Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Key factors determining whether the alloying or atomization of Pt NPs on a single Co site rich carbon support are dynamically revealed, including initial Pt loadings, particle sizes, the nature of the carbon supports, and the annealing conditions. The corresponding ordered Pt3Co intermetallic and single Pt/Co site (i.e., PtC3N/CoN4) catalysts are evaluated for the oxygen reduction reaction. The established structure&#8211;property correlations shed light on the design of advanced Pt&#8208;based electrocatalysts.








Abstract
Due to their exceptional catalytic properties for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and other crucial electrochemical reactions, PtCo intermetallic nanoparticle (NP) and single atomic (SA) Pt metal site catalysts have received considerable attention. However, their formation mechanisms at the atomic level during high&#8208;temperature annealing processes remain elusive. Here, the thermally driven structure evolution of Pt&#8211;Co binary catalyst systems is investigated using advanced in situ electron microscopy, including PtCo intermetallic alloys and single Pt/Co metal sites. The pre&#8208;doping of CoN4 sites in carbon supports and the initial Pt NP sizes play essential roles in forming either Pt3Co intermetallics or single Pt/Co metal sites. Importantly, the initial Pt NP loadings against the carbon support are critical to whether alloying to L12&#8208;ordered Pt3Co NPs or atomizing to SA Pt sites at high temperatures. High Pt NP loadings (e.g., 20%) tend to lead to the formation of highly ordered Pt3Co intermetallic NPs with excellent activity and enhanced stability toward the ORR. In contrast, at a relatively low Pt loading (&lt;6&#160;wt%), the formation of single Pt sites in the form of PtC3N is thermodynamically favorable, in which a synergy between the PtC3N and the CoN4 sites could enhance the catalytic activity for the ORR, but showing insufficient stability.

         <title>Design Principles of Sodium/Potassium Protection Layer for High&#8208;Power High&#8208;Energy Sodium/Potassium&#8208;Metal Batteries in Carbonate Electrolytes: a Case Study of Na2Te/K2Te</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Na2Te (K2Te) protection layer with high ionic conductivity, low electronic conductivity, and high mechanical stability on a Na (K) metal anode is designed and prepared. The Na@Na2Te (K@K2Te) realizes excellent electrochemi cal performance for sodium&#8208;metal (potassiummetal) batteries of both symmetrical cells and full batteries in widely used carbonate electrolytes.








Abstract
The sodium (potassium)&#8208;metal anodes combine low&#8208;cost, high theoretical capacity, and high energy density, demonstrating promising application in sodium (potassium)&#8208;metal batteries. However, the dendrites&#8217; growth on the surface of Na (K) has impeded their practical application. Herein, density functional theory (DFT) results predict Na2Te/K2Te is beneficial for Na+/K+ transport and can effectively suppress the formation of the dendrites because of low Na+/K+ migration energy barrier and ultrahigh Na+/K+ diffusion coefficient of 3.7 &#215; 10&#8722;10 cm2 s&#8722;1/1.6 &#215; 10&#8722;10 cm2 s&#8722;1 (300 K), respectively. Then a Na2Te protection layer is prepared by directly painting the nanosized Te powder onto the sodium&#8208;metal surface. The Na@Na2Te anode can last for 700 h in low&#8208;cost carbonate electrolytes (1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, 1 mAh cm&#8722;2), and the corresponding Na3V2 (PO4)3//Na@Na2Te full cell exhibits high energy density of 223&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at an unprecedented power density of 29687 W kg&#8722;1 as well as an ultrahigh capacity retention of 93% after 3000 cycles at 20 C. Besides, the K@K2Te&#8208;based potassium&#8208;metal full battery also demonstrates high power density of 20 577 W kg&#8722;1 with energy density of 154&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1. This work opens up a new and promising avenue to stabilize sodium (potassium)&#8208;metal anodes with simple and low&#8208;cost interfacial layers.

         <title>Direct Atomic&#8208;Scale Structure and Electric Field Imaging of Triazine&#8208;Based Crystalline Carbon Nitride</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The differential phase contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy technique reveals the local atomic configuration and also directly determines the atomic electric field of poly(triazine imide) crystal, the triazine&#8208;based crystalline carbon nitride. These findings offer a fundamental insight on the electronic structure for photoabsorption and the migration of charge carriers in photocatalysis with this material.








Abstract
Crystalline carbon nitrides (CNs) have recently attracted considerable attention owing to their superior photocatalytic activity. However, the electron&#8208;beam&#8208;sensitive nature of crystalline CNs hinders atomic&#8208;resolution imaging of their local structures by conventional (scanning) transmission electron microscopy ((S)TEM) techniques. Here, the atomic structure of a triazine&#8208;based crystalline CN, poly(triazine imide) (PTI) incorporated with lithium and chloride ions, is unambiguously revealed using the emerging imaging technique of differential phase contrast STEM under a low dose. The lightest&#8208;element Li/H configuration is resolved within framework cavities of PTI and significantly affects the electronic structure for photoabsorption. The atomic electric field of PTI crystal directly determined in real space provides a fundamental evidence for the chemical bonding of Li ions and adjacent atoms for the migration of photogenerated carriers. These results facilitate the comprehension on local atomic configuration and chemical bonding state of crystalline CNs and can lead to a deeper understanding of the photocatalytic mechanism.

         <title>Managing Growth and Dimensionality of Quasi 2D Perovskite Single&#8208;Crystalline Flakes for Tunable Excitons Orientation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Centimeter&#8208;sized quasi 2D&#8208;perovskites with tunable number of inorganic layers are synthesized by an innovative synthetic approach based on the use of a reactant, potassium iodide, that can modulate the supersaturation levels of the perovskite precursors solution without being part of the final products. Exciton orientation is changed from &#8220;in&#8208;plane&#8221; to &#8220;out&#8208;of&#8208;plane&#8221; by increasing the &#8220;n&#8221; value.








Abstract
Hybrid perovskites are among the most promising materials for optoelectronic applications. Their 2D crystalline form is even more interesting since the alternating inorganic and organic layers naturally forge a multiple quantum&#8208;well structure, leading to the formation of stable excitonic resonances. Nevertheless, a controlled modulation of the quantum well width, which is defined by the number of inorganic layers (n) between two organic ones, is not trivial and represents the main synthetic challenge in the field. Here, a conceptually innovative approach to easily tune n in lead iodide perovskite single&#8208;crystalline flakes is presented. The judicious use of potassium iodide is found to modulate the supersaturation levels of the precursors solution without being part of the final products. This allows to obtain a fine tuning of the n value. The excellent optical quality of the as synthesized flakes guarantees an in&#8208;depth analysis by Fourier&#8208;space microscopy, revealing that the excitons orientation can be manipulated by modifying the number of inorganic layers. Excitonic out&#8208;of&#8208;plane component, indeed, is enhanced when &#8220;n&#8221; is increased. The combined advances in the synthesis and optical characterization fill in the picture of the exciton behavior in low&#8208;dimensional perovskite, paving the way to the design of materials with improved optoelectronic characteristics.

         <title>Promoting Oral Mucosal Wound Healing with a Hydrogel Adhesive Based on a Phototriggered S&#8208;Nitrosylation Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on a new coupling reaction, an easily operated hydrogel adhesive that features thin&#8208;layer fabrication, ultrafast gelation, appropriate elasticity, and excellent tissue adhesion is developed. This hydrogel adhesive matches the material requirements for oral mucosal treatment and establishes a conducive microenvironment for tissue growth, thus notably shortening the healing time of mucosal wounds.








Abstract
The wet and highly dynamic environment of the mouth makes local treatment of oral mucosal diseases challenging. To overcome this, a photo&#8208;crosslinking hydrogel adhesive is developed inspired by the success of light&#8208;curing techniques in dentistry. The adhesive operates on a fast (within 5 s) phototriggered S&#8208;nitrosylation coupling reaction and employs imine anchoring to connect to host tissues. Unlike other often&#8208;used clinical agents that adhere weakly and for short durations, this thin, elastic, adhesive, and degradable cyclic o&#8208;nitrobenzyl&#8208;modified hyaluronic acid gel protects mucosal wounds from disturbance by liquid rinsing, oral movement, and friction for more than 24 h. The results from both rat and pig oral mucosa repair models demonstrate that this new gel adhesive creates a favorable microenvironment for tissue repair and can shorten tissue healing time. This study thus illustrates a therapeutic strategy with the potential to advance the treatment of oral mucosal defects in the clinic.

         <title>Crystal Phase Transition Creates a Highly Active and Stable RuCX Nanosurface for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction in Alkaline Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystal phase&#8208;transition of Ru/C from cubic&#8208;close&#8208;packing to hexagonal&#8208;close&#8208;packing creates a ruthenium carbide (RuCX, X&#160;&lt;&#160;1) nanosurface on Ru nanocrystal. The as&#8208;created RuCX nanosurface presents a highly active and stable performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media. Density functional theory calculations predict the RuCX sites as bifunctional configurations for improving alkaline HER kinetics.








Abstract
Although metastable crystal structures have received much attention owing to their utilization in various fields, their phase&#8208;transition to a thermodynamic structure has attracted comparably little interest. In the case of nanoscale crystals, such an exothermic phase&#8208;transition releases high energy within a confined surface area and reconstructs surface atomic arrangement in a short time. Thus, this high&#8208;energy nanosurface may create novel crystal structures when some elements are supplied. In this work, the creation of a ruthenium carbide (RuCX, X&#160;&lt;&#160;1) phase on the surface of the Ru nanocrystal is discovered during phase&#8208;transition from cubic&#8208;close&#8208;packed to hexagonal&#8208;close&#8208;packed structure. When the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is tested in alkaline media, the RuCX exhibits a much lower overpotential and good stability relative to the counterpart Ru&#8208;based catalysts and the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt/C catalyst. Density functional theory calculations predict that the local heterogeneity of the outermost RuCX surface promotes the bifunctional HER mechanism by providing catalytic sites for both H adsorption and facile water dissociation.

         <title>Direct Measurement of Oxygen Mass Transport at the Nanoscale</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method based on atom probe tomography for the direct measurement of ion kinetics at the nanoscale is reported. Extremely high 3D resolution (&lt;1&#160;nm) and straight correlation with local cation distribution are demonstrated for the exemplary case of a mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductor exhibiting enhanced grain boundary oxygen diffusivity.








Abstract
Tuning oxygen mass transport properties at the nanoscale offers a promising approach for developing high performing energy materials. A number of strategies for engineering interfaces with enhanced oxygen diffusivity and surface exchange have been proposed. However, the origin and the magnitude of such local effects remain largely undisclosed to date due to the lack of direct measurement tools with sufficient resolution. In this work, atom probe tomography with sub&#8208;nanometer resolution is used to study oxygen mass transport on oxygen&#8208;isotope exchanged thin films of lanthanum chromite. A direct 3D visualization of nanoscaled highly conducting oxygen incorporation pathways along grain boundaries, with reliable quantification of the oxygen kinetic parameters and correlative link to local chemistries, is presented. Combined with finite element simulations of the exact nanostructure, isotope exchange&#8208;atom probe tomography allowed quantifying an enhancement in the grain boundary oxygen diffusivity and in the surface exchange coefficient of lanthanum chromite of about 4 and 3 orders of magnitude, respectively, compared to the bulk. This remarkable increase of the oxygen kinetics in an interface&#8208;dominated material is unambiguously attributed to grain boundary conduction highways thanks to the use of a powerful technique that can be straightforwardly extended to the study of currently inaccessible multiple nanoscale mass transport phenomena.

         <title>Engineering Photoresponsive Ligand Tethers for Mechanical Regulation of Stem Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy is developed to regulate the behaviors and functions of stem cells by switching the states of light&#8208;switchable tethers. This method offers the chance to study mechanotransduction via cellular tethers and realize spatiotemporal regulation of differential cell fates.








Abstract
Regulating stem cell functions by precisely controlling the nanoscale presentation of bioactive ligands has a substantial impact on tissue engineering and regenerative medicine but remains a major challenge. Here it is shown that bioactive ligands can become mechanically &#8220;invisible&#8221; by increasing their tether lengths to the substrate beyond a critical length, providing a way to regulate mechanotransduction without changing the biochemical conditions. Building on this finding, light switchable tethers are rationally designed, whose lengths can be modulated reversibly by switching a light&#8208;responsive protein, pdDronpa, in between monomer and dimer states. This allows the regulation of the adhesion, spreading, and differentiation of stem cells by light on substrates of well&#8208;defined biochemical and physical properties. Spatiotemporal regulation of differential cell fates on the same substrate is further demonstrated, which may represent an important step toward constructing complex organoids or mini tissues by spatially defining the mechanical cues of the cellular microenvironment with light.

         <title>Volatilizable Solid Additive&#8208;Assisted Treatment Enables Organic Solar Cells with Efficiency over 18.8% and Fill Factor Exceeding 80%</title>

         <dc:description>
A new morphology control approach is developed to fabricate high&#8208;performance organic solar cells by utilizing the synergistic effect of 1&#8208;chloronaphthalene (CN) and dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;d]thiophene (DTT) additives. This approach exhibits general application in various active layer systems to achieve well&#8208;developed morphology, enabling outstanding power&#8208;conversion efficiency over 18.8% and fill factor exceeding 80% for the device based on PTQ10:m&#8208;BTP&#8208;PhC6:PC71BM.








Abstract
Controlling the self&#8208;assembling of organic semiconductors to form well&#8208;developed nanoscale phase separation in the bulk&#8208;heterojunction active layer is critical yet challenging for building high&#8208;performance organic solar cells (OSCs). Particularly, the similar anisotropic conjugated structures between nonfullerene acceptors and p&#8208;type organic semiconductor donors raise more complexity on manipulating their aggregation toward appropriate phase separation. Herein, a new approach to tune the morphology of photoactive layer is developed by utilizing the synergistic effect of dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;d]thiophene (DTT) and 1&#8208;chloronaphthalene (CN). The volatilizable solid additive DTT with high crystallinity can restrict the over self&#8208;assembling of nonfullerene acceptors during the film casting process, and then allowing the refining of phase separation and molecular packing with the simultaneous volatilization of DTT under thermal annealing. Consequently, the PTQ10:m&#8208;BTP&#8208;PhC6:PC71BM&#8208;based ternary OSCs processed by the dual additives of CN and DTT record a notable power&#8208;conversion efficiency of 18.89%, with a remarkable FF of 80.6%.

Herein, two compounds 9,10&#8208;bis([N,N&#8208;diphenyl]&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;phenylethynyl)anthracene (TPA&#8208;An) and 9,10&#8208;bis([1&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;diphenyl]&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;phenylethynyl)anthracene (TBA&#8208;An) are synthesized by introducing two different luminescent groups, triphenylamine and 1,3&#8208;diphenylbenzene, at the 9,10 positions of anthracene via triple bond connection. Single crystals based on TPA&#8208;An and TBA&#8208;An with a ribbon morphology obtained through the slow solvent&#8208;evaporation method exhibit high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of 98% and 99% at room temperature, and remarkable hole mobilities of 0.45 and 0.15 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 in single&#8208;crystal organic field&#8208;effect transistors (SC&#8208;OFETs). Furthermore, UV phototransistors based on the two single crystals obtain photosensitivities of 1.03 &#215; 103 and 3.45 &#215; 104, ultrahigh photoresponsivities of 7.19 &#215; 105 and 1.50&#160;&#215; 105 A W&#8722;1, and the detectivities exceeding 1.40 &#215; 1016 and 1.60 &#215; 1017 Jones.

         <title>Photoinduced Halide Segregation in Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper 2D Mixed Halide Perovskite Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D mixed halide perovskites with bandgap tunability and increased stability are employed in photovoltaics, light&#8208;emitting diodes, and optoelectronics. Inherent halide ion mobility (instability) of mixed halides drives photoinduced halide ion segregation. The important role of dimensionality across 3D to 2D perovskites governs the excited&#8208;state dynamics and the kinetics of halide segregation and dark recovery.








Abstract
2D lead halide perovskites, which exhibit bandgap tunability and increased chemical stability, have been found to be useful for designing optoelectronic devices. Reducing dimensionality with decreasing number of layers (n&#160;=&#160;10&#8211;1) also imparts resistance to light&#8208;induced ion migration as seen from the halide ion segregation and dark recovery in mixed halide (Br:I&#160;=&#160;50:50) perovskite films. The light&#8208;induced halide ion segregation efficiency, as determined from difference absorbance spectra, decreases from 20% to &lt;1%&#160;as the dimensionality is decreased for 2D perovskite film from n&#160;=&#160;10 to 1. The segregation rate constant (ksegregation), which decreases from 5.9&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3&#160;s&#8722;1 (n&#160;=&#160;10) to 3.6&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4&#160;s&#8722;1 (n&#160;=&#160;1), correlates well with nearly an order of magnitude decrease observed in charge&#8208;carrier lifetime (&#964;average&#160;=&#160;233&#160;ps for n&#160;=&#160;10&#160;vs &#964;avg&#160;=&#160;27&#160;ps for n&#160;=&#160;1). The tightly bound excitons in 2D perovskites make charge separation less probable, which in turn decreases the halide mobility and resulting phase segregation. The importance of controlling the dimensionality of the 2D architecture in suppressing halide ion mobility is discussed.

         <title>Highly Sensitive Capacitive Pressure Sensors over a Wide Pressure Range Enabled by the Hybrid Responses of a Highly Porous Nanocomposite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low sensitivity at large pressure is a long&#8208;standing obstacle of capacitive pressure sensors. A novel soft capacitive pressure sensor that employs an electrically conductive porous nanocomposite is a promising solution for resolving this chronic challenge. This hybrid&#8208;response pressure sensor exhibits unprecedented sensitivity up to 50 kPa. An analytical model explains its mechanism and enables selection of optimal manufacturing parameters.








Abstract
Past research aimed at increasing the sensitivity of capacitive pressure sensors has mostly focused on developing dielectric layers with surface/porous structures or higher dielectric constants. However, such strategies have only been effective in improving sensitivities at low pressure ranges (e.g., up to 3&#160;kPa). To overcome this well&#8208;known obstacle, herein, a flexible hybrid&#8208;response pressure sensor (HRPS) composed of an electrically conductive porous nanocomposite (PNC) laminated with an ultrathin dielectric layer is devised. Using a nickel foam template, the PNC is fabricated with carbon nanotubes (CNTs)&#8208;doped Ecoflex to be 86% porous and electrically conductive. The PNC exhibits hybrid piezoresistive and piezocapacitive responses, resulting in significantly enhanced sensitivities (i.e., more than 400%) over wide pressure ranges, from 3.13 kPa&#8722;1 within 0&#8211;1 kPa to 0.43 kPa&#8722;1 within 30&#8211;50 kPa. The effect of the hybrid responses is differentiated from the effect of porosity or high dielectric constants by comparing the HRPS with its purely piezocapacitive counterparts. Fundamental understanding of the HRPS and the prediction of optimal CNT doping are achieved through simplified analytical models. The HRPS is able to measure pressures from as subtle as the temporal arterial pulse to as large as footsteps.

A metal&#8211;organic&#8208;framework&#8208;sacrificed in situ acid&#8208;etching strategy to bring about the controllable synthesis of a series of covalent organic framework based multicomponent nanocomposites from core&#8211;shell, yolk&#8211;shell, and hollow&#8208;sphere structures is presented. Combining the unique yolk&#8211;shell structure with the synergistic effects of the three components, the MTCN&#8208;H (ys) demon strates remarkable catalytic performance in photocatalytic reduction of CO2 with H2O.








Abstract
The precise tuning and multi&#8208;dimensional processing of covalent organic frameworks (COFs)&#8208;based materials into multicomponent superstructures with appropriate diversity are essential to maximize their advantages in catalytic reactions. However, up to now, it remains an ongoing challenge for the precise design of COFs&#8208;based multicomponent nanocomposites with diverse architectures. Herein, a metal organic framework (MOF)&#8208;sacrificed in situ acid&#8208;etching (MSISAE) strategy that enables continuous synthesis of core&#8208;shell, yolk&#8208;shell, and hollow&#8208;sphere COFs&#8208;based nanocomposites through tuning of core decomposition (NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 into TiO2) rate is developed. More importantly, due to the multiple active sites, fast transfer of carriers, increased light utilization ability, et al, one of the obtained samples, NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125/TiO2@COF&#8208;366&#8208;Ni&#8208;OH&#8208;HAc (yolk&#8208;shell) with special three components, exhibits high photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion efficiency in the gas&#8208;solid mode. The MSISAE strategy developed in this work achieves the precise morphology design and control of multicomponent hybrid composites based on COFs, which may pave a new way in devealoping porous crystalline materials with powerful superstructures for multifunctional catalytic reactions.

         <title>A Conductive Network and Dipole Field for Harnessing Photogenerated Charge Kinetics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The TiO2 network exhibits two orders of magnitude enhancement in electric conductivity, which will greatly suppress electron&#8211;hole (e&#8211;h) recombination by reducing the charge&#8208;transfer resistance. In addition, 2D MXene induces a dipole at the interface. The dipole field pushes charge extraction and suppresses charge recombination by inducing band bending.








Abstract
Photogenerated charge separation and directional transfer to active sites are pivotal steps in photocatalysis, which limit the efficiency of redox reactions. Here, a conductive network and dipole field are employed to harness photogenerated charge kinetics by using a Ti3C2/TiO2 network (TTN). The TTN exhibits a prolonged charge&#8208;carrier lifetime (1.026&#160;ns) and an 11.76&#8208;fold increase in hexavalent chromium photoreduction reaction kinetics compared to TiO2 nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs). This super photocatalytic performance is derived from the efficient photogenerated charge kinetics, which is steered by the conductive network and dipole field. The conductivity enhancement of the TiO2 network is achieved by continuous chemical bonds, which promotes electron&#8211;hole (e&#8211;h) separation. In addition, at the interface of Ti3C2 and TiO2, band bending induced by the dipole field promotes photogenerated electron spatially directed transfer to the catalytic sites on Ti3C2. This study demonstrates that a conductive network and dipole field offer a new concept to harness charge kinetics for photocatalysis.

         <title>Coupling Glucose&#8208;Assisted Cu(I)/Cu(II) Redox with Electrochemical Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new approach is proposed to achieve low&#8208;voltage and continuous hydrogen production using glucose&#8208;assisted Cu(I)/Cu(II) redox as the anode reaction. Glucose in the electrolyte can reduce the Cu(II) into Cu(I) spontaneously, thus completing the cycle of Cu(I)/Cu(II) redox. The assembled electrolyzer only requires a voltage input of 0.92 V to achieve a current density of 100 mA cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Water electrolysis is a sustainable technology for hydrogen production since this process can utilize the intermittent electricity generated by renewable energy such as solar, wind, and hydro. However, the large&#8208;scale application of this process is restricted by the high electricity consumption due to the large potential gap (&gt;1.23&#160;V) between the anodic oxygen evolution reaction and the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, a novel and efficient hydrogen production system is developed for coupling glucose&#8208;assisted Cu(I)/Cu(II) redox with HER. The onset potential of the electrooxidation of Cu(I) to Cu(II) is as low as 0.7 VRHE (vs reversible hydrogen electrode). In situ Raman spectroscopy, ex situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculation demonstrates that glucose in the electrolyte can reduce the Cu(II) into Cu(I) instantaneously via a thermocatalysis process, thus completing the cycle of Cu(I)/Cu(II) redox. The assembled electrolyzer only requires a voltage input of 0.92&#160;V to achieve a current density of 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Consequently, the electricity consumption for per cubic H2 produced in the system is 2.2&#160;kWh, only half of the value for conventional water electrolysis (4.5&#160;kWh). This work provides a promising strategy for the low&#8208;cost, efficient production of high&#8208;purity H2.

         <title>Physiologically Self&#8208;Regulated, Fully Implantable, Battery&#8208;Free System for Peripheral Nerve Restoration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A physiologically self&#8208;regulated, fully implantable, battery&#8208;free neural electrical stimulation system is successfully constructed to produce physiologically electrical signals for the acceleration of regeneration and functional recovery of peripheral nerve injury.








Abstract
The long&#8208;segment peripheral nerve injury (PNI) represents a global medical challenge, leading to incomplete nerve tissue recovery and unsatisfactory functional reconstruction. However, the current electrical stimulation (ES) apparatuses fail perfect nerve repair due to their inability of the variable synchronous self&#8208;regulated function with physiological states. It is urgent to develop an implantable ES platform with physiologically adaptive function to provide instantaneous and nerve&#8208;preferred ES. Here, a physiologically self&#8208;regulated electrical signal is generated by integrating a novel tribo/piezoelectric hybrid nanogenerator with a nanoporous nerve guide conduit to construct a fully implantable neural electrical stimulation (FI&#8208;NES) system. The optimal neural ES parameters completely originate from the body itself and are highly self&#8208;responsive to different physiological states. The morphological evaluation, representative protein expression level, and functional reconstruction of the regenerated nerves are conducted to assess the PNI recovery process. Evidence shows that the recovery effect of 15&#160;mm length nerve defects under the guidance of the FI&#8208;NES system is significantly close to the autograft. The designed FI&#8208;NES system provides an effective method for long&#8208;term accelerating the recovery of PNI in vivo and is also appropriate for other tissue injury or neurodegenerative diseases.

         <title>Construction of Six&#8208;Oxygen&#8208;Coordinated Single Ni Sites on g&#8208;C3N4 with Boron&#8208;Oxo Species for Photocatalytic Water&#8208;Activation&#8208;Induced CO2 Reduction</title>

         <dc:description>
Six&#8208;oxygen&#8208;coordinated single Ni (II) sites are successfully anchored by highly dispersed boron&#8208;oxo species on g&#8208;C3N4 nanosheets. The as&#8208;fabricated single&#8208;atom Ni photocatalyst can realize efficient photocatalytic CO2 reduction, where single Ni atoms can effectively capture photoelectrons and preferentially reduce absorbed water to produce H atoms as active species eventually inducing the reduction of CO2.








Abstract
The configuration regulation of single&#8208;atom photocatalysts (SAPCs) can significantly influence the interfacial charge transfer and subsequent catalytic process. The construction of conventional SAPCs for aqueous CO2 reduction is mainly devoted toward favorable activation and photoreduction of CO2, however, the role of water is frequently neglected. In this work, single Ni atoms are successfully anchored by boron&#8208;oxo species on g&#8208;C3N4 nanosheets through a facile ion&#8208;exchange method. The dative interaction between the B atom and the sp2 N atom of g&#8208;C3N4 guarantees the high dispersion of boron&#8208;oxo species, where O atoms coordinate with single Ni (II) sites to obtain a unique six&#8208;oxygen&#8208;coordinated configuration. The optimized single&#8208;atom Ni photocatalyst, rivaling Pt&#8208;modified g&#8208;C3N4 nanosheets, provides excellent CO2 reduction rate with CO and CH4 as products. Quasi&#8208;in&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectra, transient absorption spectra, isotopic labeling, and in situ Fourier transform infrared spectra reveal that as&#8208;fabricated six&#8208;oxygen&#8208;coordinated single Ni (II) sites can effectively capture the photoelectrons of CN along the B&#63743;O bridges and preferentially activate adsorbed water to produce H atoms to eventually induce a hydrogen&#8208;assisted CO2 reduction. This work diversifies the synthetic strategies for single&#8208;atom catalysts and provides insight on correlation between the single&#8208;atom configuration and reaction pathway.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inkjet&#8208;printing approaches are used to fabricate flexible organometallic halide perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes on elastic substrates from the bottom anode to the top cathode under ambient conditions. The fabrication time is significantly shortened by at least tenfold. The device has a novel simplified 4&#8208;layer structure without conventional electron&#8208; and hole&#8208;transport&#8208;layer, but still exhibits extremely high performance even under aggressive bending tests.








Abstract
Halide perovskites have great potential for use in high&#8208;performance light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) and displays. Here, a perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs) fabricated directly on an elastomer substrate, in which every single layer in the device from bottom anode to top cathode is patterned solely using a highly scalable inkjet printing process, is reported. Compared to PeLEDs made using conventional microfabrication processes, the printing process significantly shortens the fabrication time by at least tenfold (from over 5 h to less than 25 min). The all&#8208;printed PeLEDs have a novel 4&#8208;layer structure (bottom electrode, perovskite emissive layer, buffer layer, top electrode) without separate electron or hole transporting layers. For flexible PeLEDs printed directly in ambient conditions, a turn&#8208;on voltage, maximum luminance intensity, and maximum current efficiency of 3.46&#160;V, 10227&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, and 2.01&#160;cd&#160;A&#8722;1, respectively, is achieved. The devices also exhibit excellent robustness and stability even when bent to a curvature radius of 2.5&#160;mm. The reported device structure and fabrication processes can enable high&#8208;performance flexible PeLEDs to be manufactured over a larger area at extremely low cost and fast speed, which can facilitate the adoption of the promising PeLED technology in the emerging foldable displays, smart wearables, and many other applications.

         <title>3D Printing Scaffold Vaccine for Antitumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D printed scaffolds loaded with immunoregulators are developed for enhanced cancer immunotherapy. The implantable 3D scaffold vaccine with porous structure endows similar functions compared with lymphoid organs by recruiting immune cells and promoting antigen presentation, as well as inducing robust antitumor immune responses. This 3D scaffold vaccine is also capable of customized manufacturing and personalized treatment.








Abstract
Cancer vaccine platform has attracted great interest in the field of cancer immunotherapy. Here, 3D printed scaffolds loaded with immunoregulators are developed for enhanced cancer immunotherapy. The rapid manufacturing and precise molding based on 3D printing can realize the mass manufacturing of cancer vaccines and personalized design. Meanwhile, compared to the traditional hydrogel, the 3D&#8208;scaffold with porous structure endows its similar functions compared with real lymphoid organs by recruitment of a great number of immune cells, leading to the formation of &#8220;artificial tertiary lymphoid structures,&#8221; where there is a promising site to enhance both humoral and cellular immune responses. Efficient anticancer immunity is induced when combined with immune checkpoint blockade to inhibit the tumor growth. Personalized antitumor scaffold vaccines are further demonstrated for filling of tumor site after surgery to prevent cancer metastasis. Taken together, these results promise the 3D printing scaffold vaccine as the potential strategy for cancer vaccine therapy in the future.

         <title>Superior High&#8208;Temperature Strength in a Supersaturated Refractory High&#8208;Entropy Alloy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural materials with exceptional high&#8208;temperature strengths are highly desirable for high&#8208;temperature applications. In this work, three alloy&#8208;design principles of the large atomic&#8208;size and elastic&#8208;modulus mismatches, the insensitive temperature&#8208;dependence of elastic properties, and the dominance of non&#8208;screw dislocations are used to design a CrMoNbV refractory high&#8208;entropy alloy, which exhibits outperforming high&#8208;temperature strengths.








Abstract
Refractory high&#8208;entropy alloys (RHEAs) show promising applications at high temperatures. However, achieving high strengths at elevated temperatures above 1173K is still challenging due to heat softening. Using intrinsic material characteristics as the alloy&#8208;design principles, a single&#8208;phase body&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (BCC) CrMoNbV RHEA with high&#8208;temperature strengths (beyond 1000&#160;MPa at 1273 K) is designed, superior to other reported RHEAs as well as conventional superalloys. The origin of the high&#8208;temperature strength is revealed by in situ neutron scattering, transmission&#8208;electron microscopy, and first&#8208;principles calculations. The CrMoNbV's elevated&#8208;temperature strength retention up to 1273 K arises from its large atomic&#8208;size and elastic&#8208;modulus mismatches, the insensitive temperature dependence of elastic constants, and the dominance of non&#8208;screw character dislocations caused by the strong solute pinning, which makes the solid&#8208;solution strengthening pronounced. The alloy&#8208;design principles and the insights in this study pave the way to design RHEAs with outstanding high&#8208;temperature strength.

         <title>In&#8208;Materio Reservoir Computing in a Sulfonated Polyaniline Network</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sulfonated polyaniline (SPAN) organic electrochemical network device (OEND) that exhibits ionic conduction in a humid environment is used as an in materio reservoir for reservoir computing (RC). The output behavior indicates wide variations for each electrode, which improves RC performance. Practical spoken&#8208;digit classification is realized with 60% accuracy, demonstrating that SPAN OEND can manage time&#8208;series data operation in RC.








Abstract
A sulfonated polyaniline (SPAN) organic electrochemical network device (OEND) is fabricated using a simple drop&#8208;casting method on multiple Au electrodes for use in reservoir computing (RC). The SPAN network has humidity&#8208;dependent electrical properties. Under high humidity, the SPAN OEND exhibits mainly ionic conduction, including charging of an electric double layer and ionic diffusion. The nonlinearity and hysteresis of the current&#8211;voltage characteristics progressively increase with increasing humidity. The rich dynamic output behavior indicates wide variations for each electrode, which improves the RC performance because of the disordered network. For RC, waveform generation and short&#8208;term memory tasks are realized by a linear combination of outputs. The waveform task accuracy and memory capacity calculated from a short&#8208;term memory task reach 90% and 33.9, respectively. Improved spoken&#8208;digit classification is realized with 60% accuracy by only 12 outputs, demonstrating that the SPAN OEND can manage time series dynamic data operation in RC owing to a combination of rich dynamic and nonlinear electronic properties. The results suggest that SPAN&#8208;based electrochemical systems can be applied for material&#8208;based computing, by exploiting their intrinsic physicochemical behavior.

         <title>Controllable Doping in 2D Layered Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable doping by modulating the thickness is realized in 2D layered materials. The decreasing thickness&#8208;induced lattice deformation makes defects in PtSSe transit from Pt vacancies in thicker PtSSe to anion vacancies in thinner PtSSe, which leads to controllable doping. Thickness&#8208;modulated doping shows great potential in novel electronics and optoelectronics, especially including diodes and photodetectors.








Abstract
For each generation of semiconductors, the issue of doping techniques is always placed at the top of the priority list since it determines whether a material can be used in the electronic and optoelectronic industry or not. When it comes to 2D materials, significant challenges have been found in controllably doping 2D semiconductors into p&#8208; or n&#8208;type, let alone developing a continuous control of this process. Here, a unique self&#8208;modulated doping characteristic in 2D layered materials such as PtSSe, PtS0.8Se1.2, PdSe2, and WSe2 is reported. The varying number of vertically stacked&#8208;monolayers is the critical factor for controllably tuning the same material from p&#8208;type to intrinsic, and to n&#8208;type doping. Importantly, it is found that the thickness&#8208;induced lattice deformation makes defects in PtSSe transit from Pt vacancies to anion vacancies based on dynamic and thermodynamic analyses, which leads to p&#8208; and n&#8208;type conductance, respectively. By thickness&#8208;modulated doping, WSe2 diode exhibits a high rectification ratio of 4400 and a large open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.38&#160;V. Meanwhile, the PtSSe detector overcomes the shortcoming of large dark&#8208;current in narrow&#8208;bandgap optoelectronic devices. All these findings provide a brand&#8208;new perspective for fundamental scientific studies and applications.

Importantly, it is found that the thickness-induced lattice deformation makes defects in PtSSe transit from Pt vacancies to anion vacancies based on dynamic and thermodynamic analyses, which leads to p- and n-type conductance, respectively. By thickness-modulated doping, WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; diode exhibits a high rectification ratio of 4400 and a large open-circuit voltage of 0.38&#160;V. Meanwhile, the PtSSe detector overcomes the shortcoming of large dark-current in narrow-bandgap optoelectronic devices. All these findings provide a brand-new perspective for fundamental scientific studies and applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Conductive Protonated Layered Oxides from H2O Vapor&#8208;Annealed Brownmillerites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protonated 3d transition&#8208;metal oxides often display low electronic conduction, which hampers their application in electric, magnetic, thermoelectric, and catalytic fields. In this work, a thermal hydration synthesis of conductive protonated oxides from 3d transition&#8208;metal oxides is introduced. By incorporating H2O into the lattice frame, the insulating brownmillerite SrCoO2.5 transforms to a novel layered&#8208;oxide SrCoO3H, which demonstrates a highly improved electric conduction.








Abstract
Protonated 3d transition&#8208;metal oxides often display low electronic conduction, which hampers their application in electric, magnetic, thermoelectric, and catalytic fields. Electronic conduction can be enhanced by co&#8208;inserting oxygen acceptors simultaneously. However, the currently used redox approaches hinder protons and oxygen ions co&#8208;insertion due to the selective switching issues. Here, a thermal hydration strategy for systematically exploring the synthesis of conductive protonated oxides from 3d transition&#8208;metal oxides is introduced. This strategy is illustrated by synthesizing a novel layered&#8208;oxide SrCoO3H from the brownmillerite SrCoO2.5. Compared to the insulating SrCoO2.5, SrCoO3H exhibits an unprecedented high electronic conductivity above room temperature, water uptake at 250&#160;&#176;C, and a thermoelectric power factor of up to 1.2&#160;mW K&#8722;2 m&#8722;1 at 300 K. These findings open up opportunities for creating high&#8208;conductive protonated layered oxides by protons and oxygen ions co&#8208;doping.

         <title>Polymerized Hybrid Perovskites with Enhanced Stability, Flexibility, and Lattice Rigidity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid perovskite with unsaturated  organoammoniums is demonstrated to be able to undergo solid&#8208;state polymerization without damaging the perovskite structure. The polymerized perovskite behaves like a polymer with enhanced stability and flexi bility. The lattice rigidity is also enhanced due to the polymerized covalent C&#63743;C bonding. As a result, a stable and efficient polymerized perovskite light&#8208;emitting diode with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 23.2% is demonstrated.








Abstract
The intrinsic soft lattice nature of organometal halide perovskites (OHPs) makes them very tolerant to defects and ideal candidates for solution&#8208;processed optoelectronic devices. However, the soft lattice results in low stability towards external stresses such as heating and humidity, high density of phonons and strong electron&#8211;phonon coupling (EPC). Here, it is demonstrated that the OHPs with unsaturated 4&#8208;vinylbenzylammonium (VBA) as organoammonium cations can be polymerized without damaging the perovskite structure and its tolerance to defects. The polymerized perovskites show enhanced stability and flexibility compared to regular three&#8208;dimensional and two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskites. Furthermore, the polymerized 4&#8208;vinylbenzylammonium group improves perovskite lattice rigidity substantially, resulting in a reduced non&#8208;radiative recombination rate because of suppressed electron&#8211;phonon coupling, and enhanced carrier mobility because of suppressed phonon scattering. 2D polymerized perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) with strong electroluminescence at room temperature, and quasi&#8208;2D PeLEDs with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 23.2% and enhanced operation stability are demonstrated. The work has opened a new way of enhancing the intrinsic stability and optoelectronic properties of OHPs.

         <title>Understanding the Synergistic Oxidation in Dichalcogenides through Electrochemiluminescence Blinking at Millisecond Resolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergistic oxidation in molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is revealed through electrochemiluminescence blinking. The formation of sulfur vacancies at MoS2, by the edge activation of hydrogen peroxide and the oxygen migration to the basal plane, is more conducive to oxygen doping, which favors the formation of Mo&#8211;O&#8211;Mo, as active sites. This mechanism is universal to transition metal dichalcogenides containing sulfur atoms.








Abstract
The oxidation of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) has been extensively studied and applied in electronics, optics, and energy sources because of its tunable structure and performance. However, due to the lack of appropriate technology, dynamically observe the oxidation process remains an arduous task. Herein, the synergistic oxidation between edge and basal plane in molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is observed through electrogenerated chemiluminescence (ECL) blinking with a millisecond resolution. In addition, the ECL method provides a simple, convenient, and quick way to judge structural changes. The transient elevation of the ECL intensity proved the intermittent doping of oxygen at MoS2, which generates O&#8208;atom active sites. High ECL intensity enhanced from the produced hydroperoxide intermediates eases the monitoring of MoS2 particles. Further study shows that the formation of sulfur vacancies at MoS2, by the edge activation of hydrogen peroxide and the migration of oxygen to the basal plane, is more conducive to oxygen doping that favors the formation of Mo&#63743;O&#63743;Mo as new active sites to induce bursts. The revealing of sulfur vacancy&#8208;governed blinking from MoS2 indicates a complex interaction between oxygen and MoS2. The same phenomenon is observed on tungsten disulfide (WS2), which provides new information about the oxidation feature of 2D dichalcogenides.

         <title>Reborn Three&#8208;Dimensional Graphene with Ultrahigh Volumetric Desalination Capacity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D graphene (3DG) is repeatedly crushed and reshaped to upgrade its overall performance like &#8220;Phoenix Nirvana.&#8221; 3DG is reborn to a higher self as NvG, making it emerge with unprecedented advantages in areas such as capacitive deionization and becoming a new engine to initiate the development of innovative 3D structures for carbon materials.








Abstract
The constructing of 3D materials with optimal performance is urgently needed to meet the growing demand of advanced materials in the high&#8208;tech sector. A distinctive 3D graphene (3DG) is designed based on a repeated rebirth strategy to obtain a better body and performance after each round of rebirth, as if it is Phoenix Nirvana. The properties of reborn graphene, namely 3DG after Nirvana (NvG), has been dramatically upgraded compared to 3DG, including high density (3.36 times) together with high porosity, as well as better electrical conductivity (1.41 times), mechanical strength (32.4 times), and ultrafast infiltration behavior. These advantages of NvG make it a strong intrinsic motivation for application in capacitive deionization (CDI). Using NvG directly as the CDI electrode, it has an extremely high volumetric capacity of 220&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;3 at 1&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;3 and a maximum salt absorption capacity of 8.02~9.2&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;3 (8.9&#8211;10.2 times), while the power consumption for adsorption of the same mass of salt is less than a quarter of 3DG. The &#8220;Phoenix Nirvana&#8221;&#8208;like strategy of manufacturing 3D structures will undoubtedly become the new engine to kick&#8208;start the development of innovative carbon materials through an overall performance upgrade.

         <title>Revamping Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries for High Cell&#8208;Level Energy Density by Synergistic Utilization of Polysulfide Additives and Artificial Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase Layers</title>

         <dc:description>
A practical approach for achieving a high &#8220;cell&#8208;level&#8221; energy density using lithium polysulfides (LPS)&#8208;containing electrolytes and Li2S&#8208;phobic artificial solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (A&#8208;SEI) layers is presented. The synergistic effects from the LPS and A&#8208;SEI result in superior cell&#8208;level volumetric energy densities (&#8776;650&#160;Wh&#160;L&#8722;1) and large cumulative energy densities considering cycling life. 








Abstract
Despite the high theoretical capacity of lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries, a high cell&#8208;level energy density and a long cycling life are barely achieved, mainly due to the large electrolyte&#8208;to&#8208;sulfur ratio, polysulfide (PS) shuttle causing the loss of active sulfur, and the formation of passivation layers on the Li anode. To raise the energy density, holding PS in the cathode has been the most popular approach. Still, it has failed, particularly, when the sulfur loading is high enough to have energy densities similar to those of commercial Li&#8208;ion batteries. Here, a practical approach of achieving high &#8220;cell&#8208;level&#8221; energy densities is attempted using lithium PS (LPS)&#8208;containing electrolytes instead of a pure electrolyte, reducing the electrolyte&#8208;to&#8208;sulfur ratio and PS diffusion out of the cathode due to concentration differences. Meanwhile, the persistent problems including PS passivation and Li dendrites are suppressed using Li2S&#8208;phobic artificial solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (A&#8208;SEI) layers on Li metal. The synergistic effects from the LPS additives and A&#8208;SEI result in a superior cell&#8208;level volumetric energy density of 650&#160;Wh&#160;L&#8722;1 as well as large cumulative energy densities considering cycling life. This approach provides an important stepping stone to realize commercial Li&#8211;S batteries rivaling the current Li&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Phototriggered Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission and Direct Generation of 4D Soft Patterns</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to realize remote spatio&#8208;temporal control of luminescence behavior of materials through a phototriggered aggregation&#8208;induced emission (PTAIE) process is reported. With the strategy, laser&#8208;mediated mask&#8208;free writing and transformable 4D soft patterns of AIE&#8208;active gels are realized.








Abstract
Microscopic control of macroscopic phenomena is one of the core subjects in materials science. Particularly, the spatio&#8208;temporal control of material behaviors through a non&#8208;contact way is of fundamental importance but is difficult to accomplish. Herein, a strategy to realize remote spatio&#8208;temporal control of luminescence behaviors is reported. A multi&#8208;arm salicylaldehyde benzoylhydrazone&#8208;based aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogen (AIEgen)/metal&#8208;ion system, of which the fluorescence can be gated by the UV irradiation with time dependency, is developed. By changing the metal&#8208;ion species, the fluorescence emission and the intensity can also be tuned. The mechanism of the UV&#8208;mediated fluorescence change is investigated, and it is revealed that a phototriggered aggregation&#8208;induced emission (PTAIE) process contributes to the behaviors. The AIEgen is further covalently integrated into a polymeric network and the formed gel/metal&#8208;ion system can achieve laser&#8208;mediated mask&#8208;free writing enabled by the PTAIE process. Moreover, by further taking advantage of the time&#8208;dependent self&#8208;healing property of hydrazone&#8208;based dynamic covalent bond, transformable 4D soft patterns are generated. The findings and the strategy increase the ways to manipulate molecules on the supramolecule or aggregate level. They also show opportunities for the development of controllable smart materials and expand the scope of the materials in advanced optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Post&#8208;Synthesis Functionalization Enables Fine&#8208;Tuning the Molecular&#8208;Sieving Properties of Zeolites for Light Olefin/Paraffin Separations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effective size of zeolite pores is systematically tuned using a versatile method wherein organic molecules are covalently attached to zeolite frameworks via bridging oxygens using an electrophile, thereby obtaining size&#8208;selective adsorbents for light olefin/paraffin separations. 4&#8208;Methoxybenzene&#8208;functionalized MOR separates ethylene from ethane, whereas toluene&#8208;grafted MOR separates propylene/propane mixtures. Therefore, tailoring the molecular&#8208;sieving properties of zeolites by organic&#8208;functionalization broadens their applications to challenging separations.








Abstract
Zeolite molecular sieves are widely used in gas separation and shape&#8208;selective catalysis, but these applications often require discriminating differences as little as 0.1 &#197;. Molecular sieving with such size selectivity demands zeolites with highly tunable pore diameters and adsorption properties, which are technically challenging to prepare. Nevertheless, it is shown that a wide range of organic functional groups can be covalently functionalized onto the interior pore walls of the zeolites, MOR, LTL, FAU, and MFI, to systematically &#8220;tune&#8221; their effective pore diameters with respect to the size of organic groups. For organic functionalization, small and aggressive organic electrophiles are used (e.g., organo&#8208;halide and &#8208;diazonium) as grafting agents, which are accessible to the intracrystalline void space, forming a C&#8211;Ozeolite bond in a reaction with a bridging oxygen as proved by multiple analysis data. It is demonstrated that the post&#8208;functionalization can be used to tailor the molecular sieving action of a parent zeolite to give size&#8208;selective adsorbents for light olefin/paraffin separations. 4&#8208;Methoxybenzene&#8208;functionalized MOR separates ethylene from ethane with an ideal&#8208;adsorbed&#8208;solution&#8208;theory selectivity of &#8776;5873, whereas toluene&#8208;grafted MOR completely separates propylene/propane mixtures. Therefore, tailoring the molecular&#8208;sieving properties of zeolites by organic functionalization broadens their applications to challenging separations.

         <title>Molecularly Engineered Black Phosphorus Heterostructures with Improved Ambient Stability and Enhanced Charge Carrier Mobility</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular engineering strategy is demonstrated to prepare ambient stable black phosphorus (BP)/hexaazatriphenylene (HAT) hybrid heterostructures. This strategy not only modifies the band structure of BP sheets but also improves their charge mobility, paving the way toward ambient processing and fabrication of high&#8208;performance BP&#8208;based devices.








Abstract
Overcoming the intrinsic instability and preserving unique electronic properties are key challenges for the practical applications of black phosphorus (BP) under ambient conditions. Here, it is demonstrated that molecular heterostructures of BP and hexaazatriphenylene derivatives (BP/HATs) enable improved environmental stability and charge transport properties. The strong interfacial coupling and charge transfer between the HATs and the BP lattice decrease the surface electron density and protect BP sheets from oxidation, resulting in an excellent ambient lifetime of up to 21 d. Importantly, HATs increase the charge scattering time of BP, contributing to an improved carrier mobility of 97 cm2 V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1, almost three times of the pristine BP films, based on noninvasive THz spectroscopic studies. The film mobility is an order of magnitude larger than previously reported values in exfoliated 2D materials. The strategy opens up new avenues for versatile applications of BP sheets and provides an effective method for tuning the physicochemical properties of other air&#8208;sensitive 2D semiconductors.

         <title>Hybrid Organic&#8211;Inorganic&#8211;Organic Isoporous Membranes with Tunable Pore Sizes and Functionalities for Molecular Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic&#8211;organic isoporous membranes are fabricated via sequential infiltration synthesis and atomic layer deposition within block copolymer membranes followed by addition of functional organic molecules. The membrane pore sizes are controlled by metal oxide growth in a predictive manner. The hybrid membranes exhibit superior selectivity and permeability in separating 1&#8211;2 nm organic molecules and similar&#8208;sized proteins.








Abstract
Accomplishing on&#8208;demand molecular separation with a high selectivity and good permeability is very desirable for pollutant removal and chemical and pharmaceutical processing. The major challenge for sub&#8208;10&#160;nm filtration of particles and molecules is the fabrication of high&#8208;performance membranes with tunable pore size and designed functionality. Here, a versatile top&#8208;down approach is demonstrated to produce such a membrane using isoporous block copolymer membranes with well&#8208;defined pore sizes combined with growth of metal oxide using sequential infiltration synthesis and atomic layer deposition (SIS and ALD). The pore size of the membranes is tuned by controlled metal oxide growth within and onto the polymer channels, enabling up to twofold pore diameter reduction. Following the growth, the distinct functionalities are readily incorporated along the membrane nanochannels with either hydrophobic, cationic, or anionic groups via straightforward and scalable gas/liquid&#8211;solid interface reactions. The hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity of the membrane nanochannel is significantly changed by the introduction of hydrophilic metal oxide and hydrophobic fluorinated groups. The functionalized membranes exhibit a superior selectivity and permeability in separating 1&#8211;2&#160;nm organic molecules and fractionating similar&#8208;sized proteins based on size, charge, and hydrophobicity. This demonstrates the great potential of organic&#8211;inorganic&#8211;organic isoporous membranes for high&#8208;performance molecular separation in numerous applications.

         <title>Textile Waste Fiber Regeneration via a Green Chemistry Approach: A Molecular Strategy for Sustainable Fashion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A green chemical method for complete separation and regeneration of natural/synthetic blended fabrics is introduced, which aims to provide a universal recycling strategy for fast fashion waste and provide a new source of fibers. Besides single&#8208;component fibers, a new composite fiber consisting of cellulose and wool keratin is also regenerated, which presents unique morphology differing from previous studies.








Abstract
Fast fashion, as a continuously growing part of the textile industry, is widely criticized for its excessive resource use and high generation of textiles. To reduce its environmental impacts, numerous efforts are focused on finding sustainable and eco&#8208;friendly approaches to textile recycling. However, waste textiles and fibers are still mainly disposed of in landfills or by incineration after their service life and thereby pollute the natural environment, as there is still no effective strategy to separate natural fibers from chemical fibers. Herein, a green chemistry strategy is developed for the separation and regeneration of waste textiles at the molecular level. Cellulose/wool keratin composite fibers and multicomponent fibers are regenerated from waste textiles via a green chemical process. The strategy attempts to reduce the large amount of waste textiles generated by the fast&#8208;developing fashion industry and provide a new source of fibers, which can also address the fossil fuel reserve shortages caused by chemical fiber industries and global food shortages caused by natural fiber production.

         <title>Elastic Lattice and Excess Charge Carrier Manipulation in 1D&#8211;3D Perovskite Solar Cells for Exceptionally Long&#8208;Term Operational Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electro&#8208;strictive strain in 3D polycrystalline perovskite is observed, which can lead to an accelerated ion migration under operational conditions. The 1D&#8211;3D perovskite, that is, 1D BnPbI3 perovskite, spatially distributed in the 3D perovskite film and compensating the dangling bonds in the grain boundaries, can effectively inhibit electro&#8208;strictive  responses and unbalanced charge carrier extraction, realizing ultralong operational stability.








Abstract
3D organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid halide perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs) inherently face severe instability issue due to ion migration under operational conditions. This ion migration inevitably results from the decomposition of ionic bonds under lattice strain and is accelerated by the existence of excess charge carriers. In this study, a 1D&#8211;3D mixed&#8208;dimensional perovskite material is explored by adding an organic salt with a bulk benzimidazole cation (Bn+). The Bn+ can induce 3D perovskite crystalline growth with the preferred orientation and form a 1D BnPbI3 perovskite spatially distributed in the 3D perovskite film. For the first time, the electro&#8208;strictive response, which has a significant influence on the lattice strain under an electric field, is observed in polycrystalline perovskite. The 1D&#8211;3D perovskite can effectively suppress electro&#8208;strictive responses and unbalanced charge carrier extraction, providing an intrinsically stable lattice with enhanced ionic bonds and fewer excess charge carriers. As a result, the ion migration behavior of the p&#8208;i&#8208;n 1D&#8211;3D based pero&#8208;SC is dramatically suppressed under operational conditions, showing ultra&#8208;long&#8208;term stability that retains 95.3% of its initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) under operation for 3072 h, and simultaneously achieving an excellent PCE with a hysteresis&#8208;free photovoltaic behavior.

Cancer Immunotherapy
In article number 2106768, Chao Wang and co&#8208;workers develop a 3D&#8208;printed scaffold loaded with immunoregulators for enhanced cancer immunotherapy. The 3D&#8208;scaffold with porous structure endows the system with similar functions to real lymphoid organs by the recruitment of a large number of immune cells, leading to the formation of &#8220;artificial tertiary lymphoid structures&#8221; (aTLS), which are promising sites to enhance both humoral and cellular immune responses.

&lt;p&gt;In article number &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202106768"&gt;2106768&lt;/a&gt;, Chao Wang and co-workers develop a 3D-printed scaffold loaded with immunoregulators for enhanced cancer immunotherapy. The 3D-scaffold with porous structure endows the system with similar functions to real lymphoid organs by the recruitment of a large number of immune cells, leading to the formation of &#8220;artificial tertiary lymphoid structures&#8221; (aTLS), which are promising sites to enhance both humoral and cellular immune responses. Efficient anticancer immunity is induced when combined with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis.

Capacitive Pressure Sensors
Low sensitivity at large pressure has been a long&#8208;lasting obstacle of capacitive pressure sensors. In article number 2103320, Nanshu Lu and co&#8208;workers introduce a hybrid&#8208;response pressure sensor (HRPS), which offers a promising solution to this challenge. By laminating an electrically conductive porous nanocomposite (PNC) with an ultrathin insulating layer, the combined piezoresistivity and piezocapacitivity of the PNC enable up to 423% improvement over existing sensors.

Topological Nodal Line States
A mirror helps light rays to make an image of an object; the mirror planes in a material's crystal structure similarly guide electrons and enhance the properties. In article number 2104126, Chandra Shekhar and co&#8208;workers demonstrate that the abundance of such mirror planes is primarily responsible for topological nodal line states at the Fermi energy in some ferromagnetic metals, leading to a large anomalous Hall conductivity.

Molecular Sieves
Zeolite molecular sieves are widely used in gas separation, but this application often requires discriminating differences as little as 0.1 &#197;. Molecular sieving with such size selectivity demands zeolites with highly tunable pore diameters. In article number 2105398, Michal Mazur, Hae Sung Cho, Changbum Jo, and co&#8208;workers report the development of a versatile method for tuning zeolite micropores by attaching organic molecules to internal bridging oxygens, thereby obtaining size&#8208;selective adsorbents for light olefin/paraffin separation.

         <title>Conquering the Hypoxia Limitation for Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficacy of photodynamic therapy is often restricted by the hypoxic tumor microenvironment (TME). The strategies deve loped to alleviate tumor hypoxia in the past decades are reviewed, including delivering exogenous O2, in situ O2 generation, reducing cellular O2 consumption by inhibiting respiration, regulating the TME, and inhibiting the hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor 1 (HIF&#8208;1) signaling pathway.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has aroused great research interest in recent years owing to its high spatiotemporal selectivity, minimal invasiveness, and low systemic toxicity. However, due to the hypoxic nature characteristic of many solid tumors, PDT is frequently limited in therapeutic effect. Moreover, the consumption of O2 during PDT may further aggravate the tumor hypoxic condition, which promotes tumor proliferation, metastasis, and invasion resulting in poor prognosis of treatment. Therefore, numerous efforts have been made to increase the O2 content in tumor with the goal of enhancing PDT efficacy. Herein, these strategies developed in past decade are comprehensively reviewed to alleviate tumor hypoxia, including 1) delivering exogenous O2 to tumor directly, 2) generating O2 in situ, 3) reducing tumor cellular O2 consumption by inhibiting respiration, 4) regulating the TME, (e.g., normalizing tumor vasculature or disrupting tumor extracellular matrix), and 5) inhibiting the hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor 1 (HIF&#8208;1) signaling pathway to relieve tumor hypoxia. Additionally, the O2&#8208;independent Type&#8208;I PDT is also discussed as an alternative strategy. By reviewing recent progress, it is hoped that this review will provide innovative perspectives in new nanomaterials designed to combat hypoxia and avoid the associated limitation of PDT.

     alt="Conquering the Hypoxia Limitation for Photodynamic Therapy"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The efficacy of photodynamic therapy is often restricted by the hypoxic tumor microenvironment (TME). The strategies deve loped to alleviate tumor hypoxia in the past decades are reviewed, including delivering exogenous O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, in situ O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation, reducing cellular O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; consumption by inhibiting respiration, regulating the TME, and inhibiting the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) signaling pathway.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has aroused great research interest in recent years owing to its high spatiotemporal selectivity, minimal invasiveness, and low systemic toxicity. However, due to the hypoxic nature characteristic of many solid tumors, PDT is frequently limited in therapeutic effect. Moreover, the consumption of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; during PDT may further aggravate the tumor hypoxic condition, which promotes tumor proliferation, metastasis, and invasion resulting in poor prognosis of treatment. Therefore, numerous efforts have been made to increase the O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; content in tumor with the goal of enhancing PDT efficacy. Herein, these strategies developed in past decade are comprehensively reviewed to alleviate tumor hypoxia, including 1) delivering exogenous O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to tumor directly, 2) generating O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in situ, 3) reducing tumor cellular O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; consumption by inhibiting respiration, 4) regulating the TME, (e.g., normalizing tumor vasculature or disrupting tumor extracellular matrix), and 5) inhibiting the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) signaling pathway to relieve tumor hypoxia. Additionally, the O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-independent Type-I PDT is also discussed as an alternative strategy. By reviewing recent progress, it is hoped that this review will provide innovative perspectives in new nanomaterials designed to combat hypoxia and avoid the associated limitation of PDT.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineered Bifunctional Proteins for Targeted Cancer Therapy: Prospects and Challenges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of various forms of bifunctional proteins (BFPs) for cancer treatment is becoming increasingly popular and important. BFPs can simultaneously act on different components in the tumor microenvironment, which are expected to play a diverse role in combating tumor heterogeneity and improving treatment outcomes. A variety of preclinical and early&#8208;stage clinical studies have reported their great potential in cancer treatment.








Abstract
Bifunctional proteins (BFPs) are a class of therapeutic agents produced through genetic engineering and protein engineering, and are increasingly used to treat various human diseases, including cancer. These proteins usually have two or more biological functions&#8212;specifically recognizing different molecular targets to regulate the related signaling pathways, or mediating effector molecules/cells to kill tumor cells. Unlike conventional small&#8208;molecule or single&#8208;target drugs, BFPs possess stronger biological activity but lower systemic toxicity. Hence, BFPs are considered to offer many benefits for the treatment of heterogeneous tumors. In this review, the authors briefly describe the unique structural feature of BFP molecules and innovatively divide them into bispecific antibodies, cytokine&#8208;based BFPs (immunocytokines), and protein toxin&#8208;based BFPs (immunotoxins) according to their mode of action. In addition, the latest advances in the development of BFPs are discussed and the potential limitations or problems in clinical applications are outlined. Taken together, future studies need to be centered on understanding the characteristics of BFPs for optimizing and designing more effective such drugs.

         <title>Advances in Microwave Synthesis of Nanoporous Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microwave ovens can be used as powerful devices in the synthesis of various  porous materials including silicas, carbons, metal&#8211;organic frameworks, and metal oxides. Microwave&#8208;assisted synthesis offers a simple, fast, efficient, and economic way to obtain nanoporous materials. The recent achievements in the microwave&#8208;assisted synthesis of these  diverse nanoporous materials and their potential applications are summarized.








Abstract
Usually, porous materials are synthesized by using conventional electric heating, which can be energy&#8208; and time&#8208;consuming. Microwave heating is commonly used in many households to quickly heat food. Microwave ovens can also be used as powerful devices in the synthesis of various porous materials. The microwave&#8208;assisted synthesis offers a simple, fast, efficient, and economic way to obtain many of the advanced nanomaterials. This review summarizes the recent achievements in the microwave&#8208;assisted synthesis of diverse groups of nanoporous materials including silicas, carbons, metal&#8211;organic frameworks, and metal oxides. Microwave&#8208;assisted methods afford highly porous materials with high specific surface areas (SSAs), e.g., activated carbons with SSA &#8776;3100 m2 g&#8722;1, metal&#8211;organic frameworks with SSA &#8776;4200&#160;m2 g&#8722;1, covalent organic frameworks with SSA &#8776;2900 m2 g&#8722;1, and metal oxides with relatively small SSA &#8776;300 m2 g&#8722;1. These methods are also successfully implemented for the preparation of ordered mesoporous silicas and carbons as well as spherically shaped nanomaterials. Most of the nanoporous materials obtained under microwave irradiation show potential applications in gas adsorption, water treatment, catalysis, energy storage, and drug delivery, among others.

         <title>Manipulating Intratumoral Fenton Chemistry for Enhanced Chemodynamic and Chemodynamic&#8208;Synergized Multimodal Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The advances in reinforcement strategies to increase the efficiency of intratumoral Fenton reaction are discussed. Then, multimodal anticancer therapies involving enhanced chemodynamic therapy and mechanisms of synergy are highlighted. Finally, the major challenges and further improvements of this evolving field are elaborated.








Abstract
Chemodynamic therapy (CDT) uses the tumor microenvironment&#8208;assisted intratumoral Fenton reaction for generating highly toxic hydroxyl free radicals (&#8226;OH) to achieve selective tumor treatment. However, the limited intratumoral Fenton reaction efficiency restricts the therapeutic efficacy of CDT. Recent years have witnessed the impressive development of various strategies to increase the efficiency of intratumoral Fenton reaction. The introduction of these reinforcement strategies can dramatically improve the treatment efficiency of CDT and further promote the development of enhanced CDT (ECDT)&#8208;based multimodal anticancer treatments. In this review, the authors systematically introduce these reinforcement strategies, from their basic working principles, reinforcement mechanisms to their representative clinical applications. Then, ECDT&#8208;based multimodal anticancer therapy is discussed, including how to integrate these emerging Fenton reinforcement strategies for accelerating the development of multimodal anticancer therapy, as well as the synergistic mechanisms of ECDT and other treatment methods. Eventually, future direction and challenges of ECDT and ECDT&#8208;based multimodal synergistic therapies are elaborated, highlighting the key scientific problems and unsolved technical bottlenecks to facilitate clinical translation.
