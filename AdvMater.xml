         <title>High Energy Density Solid State Lithium Metal Batteries Enabled by Sub&#8208;5 &#181;m Solid Polymer Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thin, solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) are crucial to improve cell energy density. But, limited oxide stability and weak strength hinder the application of ultrathin SSEs. Here, an ultrathin bilayer SSE with porous ceramic scaffold inside is proposed to simultaneously enlarge the electrochemical window and improve the mechanical strength. High&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li metal batteries are also demonstrated.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs) are considered as the most promising next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density energy storage devices due to their ability in addressing the safety concerns from organic electrolytes and enabling energy dense lithium anodes. To ensure the high energy density of SSBs, solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) are required to be thin and light&#8208;weight, and simultaneously offer a wide electrochemical window to pair with high&#8208;voltage cathodes. However, the decrease of SSE thickness and delicate structure may increase the cell safety risks, which is detrimental for the practical application of SSBs. Herein, to demonstrate a high&#8208;energy&#8208;density SSB with sufficient safety insurance, an ultrathin (4.2 &#181;m) bilayer SSE with porous ceramic scaffold and double&#8208;layer Li+&#8208;conducting polymer, is proposed. The fire&#8208;resistant and stiff ceramic scaffold improves the safety capability and mechanical strength of the composite SSE, and the bilayer polymer structure enhances the compatibility of Li metal anode and high&#8208;voltage cathodes. The 3D ceramic facilitates Li&#8208;ion conduction and regulates Li deposition. Thus, high energy density of 506&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and 1514&#160;Wh L&#8722;1 is achieved based on LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) cathodes with a low N/P ratio and long lifespan over 3000 h. High&#8208;energy&#8208;density anode&#8208;free cells are further demonstrated.

         <title>Atomic Scale Control and Visualization of Topological Quantum Phase Transition in &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Polymers Driven by Their Length</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Length control of &#960;&#8208;conjugated pentacene polymers leads to the observation of a topological quantum phase transition. The transition is marked by the emergence of a zero energy in&#8208;gap edge state. Pseudo Jahn&#8211;Teller effect is identified as the driving mechanism by theoretical calculations. Furthermore, atomic manipulation with scanning tunneling microscopy allows for engineering polymers.








Abstract
Quantum phase transitions (QPTs) driven by quantum fluctuations are transitions between distinct quantum phases of matter. At present, they are poorly understood and not readily controlled. Here, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and noncontact atomic force microscopy (nc&#8208;AFM) are used to explore atomic scale control over quantum phase transitions between two different topological quantum states of a well&#8208;defined &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer. The phase transition is driven by a pseudo Jahn&#8211;Teller effect that is activated above a certain polymer chain length. In addition, theoretical calculations indicate the presence of long&#8208;lasting coherent fluctuations between the polymer's two quantum phases near the phase transition, at finite temperature. This work thus presents a new way of exploring atomic&#8208;scale control over QPTs and indicates that emerging quantum criticality in the vicinity of a QPT can give rise to new states of organic matter.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed High&#8208;Density Al&#8211;N4 Sites in Porous Carbon for Efficient Photodriven CO2 Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous carbon possessing atomically dispersed Al&#8211;N4 motifs exhibits excellent catalytic performance for photothermal CO2 cycloaddition reaction by taking advantage of the uniformly dispersed Al/N species and the efficient photothermal effect of the carbon matrix. Importantly, the photogenerated electrons favor transfer from Al&#8211;N&#8211;C to epoxide and significantly accelerate the rate&#8208;limiting step, which opens a new activation mechanism for CO2 cycloaddition reaction.








Abstract
Highly active catalysts that can directly utilize renewable energy (e.g., solar energy) are desirable for CO2 value&#8208;added processes. Herein, aiming at improving the efficiency of photodriven CO2 cycloaddition reactions, a catalyst composed of porous carbon nanosheets enriched with a high loading of atomically dispersed Al atoms (&#8776;14.4&#160;wt%, corresponding to an atomic percent of &#8776;7.3%) coordinated with N (AlN4 motif, Al&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst) via a versatile molecule&#8208;confined pyrolysis strategy is reported. The performance of the Al&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst for catalytic CO2 cycloaddition under light irradiation (&#8776;95% conversion, reaction rate = 3.52 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) is significantly superior to that obtained under a thermal environment (&#8776;57% conversion, reaction rate = 2.11 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). Besides the efficient photothermal conversion induced by the carbon matrix, both experimental and theoretical analysis reveal that light irradiation favors the photogenerated electron transfer from the semiconductive Al&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst to the epoxide reactant, facilitating the formation of a ring&#8208;opened intermediate through the rate&#8208;limiting step. This study not only provides an advanced Al&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst for photodriven CO2 cycloaddition, but also furnishes new insight for the rational design of superior photocatalysts for diverse heterogeneous catalytic reactions in the future.

         <title>Cation&#8208;Free siRNA Micelles as Effective Drug Delivery Platform and Potent RNAi Nanomedicines for Glioblastoma Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The siRNA micelle not only acts as a spherical nucleic acid that is able to cross blood brain barrier (BBB) and enter tumor cells, but also is capable of delivering chemical drugs into brain tumors. This multifunction endows siRNA micelle with great potential as RNAi nanomedicine or drug delivery platform for glioblastoma therapy.








Abstract
Nanoparticle&#8208;based small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapy shows great promise for glioblastoma (GBM). However, charge associated toxicity and limited blood&#8211;brain&#8208;barrier (BBB) penetration remain significant challenges for siRNA delivery for GBM therapy. Herein, novel cation&#8208;free siRNA micelles, prepared by the self&#8208;assembly of siRNA&#8208;disulfide&#8208;poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (siRNA&#8208;SS&#8208;PNIPAM) diblock copolymers, are prepared. The siRNA micelles not only display enhanced blood circulation time, superior cell take&#8208;up, and effective at&#8208;site siRNA release, but also achieve potent BBB penetration. Moreover, due to being non&#8208;cationic, these siRNA micelles exert no charge&#8208;associated toxicity. Notably, these desirable properties of this novel RNA interfering (RNAi) nanomedicine result in outstanding growth inhibition of orthotopic U87MG xenografts without causing adverse effects, achieving remarkably improved survival benefits. Moreover, as a novel type of polymeric micelle, the siRNA micelle displays effective drug loading ability. When utilizing temozolomide (TMZ) as a model loading drug, the siRNA micelle realizes effective synergistic therapy effect via targeting the key gene (signal transducers and activators of transcription 3, STAT3) in TMZ drug resistant pathways. The authors&#8217; results show that this siRNA micelle nanoparticle can serve as a robust and versatile drug codelivery platform, and RNAi nanomedicine and for effective GBM treatment.

         <title>Sono&#8208;Controllable and ROS&#8208;Sensitive CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 Genome Editing for Augmented/Synergistic Ultrasound Tumor Nanotherapy</title>

         <dc:description>
This work not only pioneers a novel avenue to circumvent the resistance of tumor cells in conventional sonodynamic therapy, but also achieves targeted delivery and controllable release of the cluster regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat&#8208;associated protein system.








Abstract
The potential of the cluster regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)&#8208;associated protein 9 (Cas9)&#8208;based therapeutic genome editing is severely hampered by the difficulties in precise regulation of the in vivo activity of the CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 system. Herein, sono&#8208;controllable and reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;sensitive sonosensitizer&#8208;integrated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), denoted as P/M@CasMTH1, are developed for augmented sonodynamic therapy (SDT) efficacy using the genome&#8208;editing technology. P/M@CasMTH1 nanoparticles comprise singlet oxygen (1O2)&#8208;generating MOF structures anchored with CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 systems via 1O2&#8208;cleavable linkers, which serve not only as a delivery vector of CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 targeting MTH1, but also as a sonoregulator to spatiotemporally activate the genome editing. P/M@CasMTH1 escapes from the lysosomes, harvests the ultrasound (US) energy and converts it into abundant 1O2 to induce SDT. The generated ROS subsequently trigger cleavage of ROS&#8208;responsive thioether bonds, thus inducing controllable release of the CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 system and initiation of genome editing. The genomic disruption of MTH1 conspicuously augments the therapeutic efficacy of SDT by destroying the self&#8208;defense system in tumor cells, thereby causing cellular apoptosis and tumor suppression. This therapeutic strategy for synergistic MTH1 disruption and abundant 1O2 generation provides a paradigm for augmenting SDT efficacy based on the emerging nanomedicine&#8208;enabled genome&#8208;editing technology.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Ruthenium on Nickel Hydroxide Ultrathin Nanoribbons for Highly Efficient Hydrogen Evolution Reaction in Alkaline Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To achieve highly efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media, atomically dispersed ruthenium (Ru) loaded nickel hydroxide ultrathin nanoribbons (R&#8208;NiRu) with extremely high aspect ratio of &#8776;100 and large Ru loading amount reaching up to &#8776;7.7&#160;wt% are synthesized via an efficient and facile one&#8208;step hydrothermal process. The R&#8208;NiRu demonstrate a superb HER performance in alkaline media.








Abstract
Achieving highly efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media is a great challenge. Single&#8208;atom catalysts with high&#8208;loading amount have attracted great interest due to their remarkable catalytic properties. Herein, by using nickel foam as the substrate, the authors design and precisely synthesize atomic ruthenium (Ru)&#8208;loaded nickel hydroxide ultrathin nanoribbons (R&#8208;NiRu) with a high atomic Ru loading amount reaching &#8776;7.7&#160;wt% via a one&#8208;step hydrothermal method. The presence of concentrated Cl&#8722; in the synthetic system is beneficial for constructing ultrathin nanoribbons, which, with abundant edge &#63743;OH groups, make it easy to trap atomic Ru. Taking advantage of the synergy between atomic Ru and the nanoribbon morphology of nickel hydroxide, R&#8208;NiRu exhibit a low overpotential of 16&#160;mV for HER at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and a Tafel slope of 40&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1 in aqueous 1.0&#160;m&#160;KOH solution, which are superior to those of commercial Pt/C (overpotential of 17&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, Tafel slope of 43&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1). Density functional theory (DFT) calculation results demonstrate that atomically dispersed Ru can significantly reduce the HER energy barrier. Moreover, R&#8208;NiRu maintains exceptional stability after 5000 cyclic voltammetry cycles. This efficient and facile synthetic strategy provides a new avenue for designing efficient catalysts.

         <title>Immunotherapy and Prevention of Cancer by Nanovaccines Loaded with Whole&#8208;Cell Components of Tumor Tissues or Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>

Preventative and therapeutic vaccines can be helpful in preventing and treating cancer. Herein, microsized cancer cells are reassembled into nanosized nanovaccines for cancer immunotherapy and prevention. It is found that such nanovaccines showed excellent therapeutic efficacy in melanoma and breast cancer on mice, and could prevent lung cancer (100%) and melanoma (70%) efficiently in mice.








Abstract
Tumor tissues/cells are the best sources of antigens to prepare cancer vaccines. However, due to the difficulty of solubilization and delivery of water&#8208;insoluble antigens in tumor tissues/cells, including water&#8208;insoluble antigens into cancer vaccines and delivering such vaccines efficiently to antigen&#8208;presenting cells (APCs) remain challenging. To solve these problems, herein, water&#8208;insoluble components of tumor tissues/cells are solubilized by 8 m urea and thus whole components of macrometer&#8208;sized tumor cells are reasssembled into nanosized nanovaccines. To induce maximized immunization efficacy, various antigens are loaded both inside and on the surface of nanovaccines. By encapsulating both water&#8208;insoluble and water&#8208;soluble components of tumor tissues/cells into nanovaccines, the nanovaccines are efficiently phagocytosed by APCs and showed better therapeutic efficacy than the nanovaccine loaded with only water&#8208;soluble components in melanoma and breast cancer. Anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 antibody and metformin can improve the efficacy of nanovaccines. In addition, the nanovaccines can prevent lung cancer (100%) and melanoma (70%) efficiently in mice. T cell analysis and tumor microenvironment analysis indicate that tumor&#8208;specific T cells are induced by nanovaccines and both adaptive and innate immune responses against cancer cells are activated by nanovaccines. Overall, this study demonstrates a universal method to make tumor&#8208;cell&#8208;based nanovaccines for cancer immunotherapy and prevention.

         <title>Large&#8208;Area Epitaxial Film Growth of van der Waals Ferromagnetic Ternary Chalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D magnetic crystals constitute ideal platforms to experimentally access the fundamental physics of magnetism and achieve magneto&#8208;optical and magneto&#8208;electric devices for future electronics. Here, a new generalized synthetic concept for producing wafer&#8208;scale epitaxial thin films of 2D ferromagnetic ternary chalcogenide crystals is described. The growth process utilizes commercial wafers (Ge, Si) as a metal source as well as epitaxy provider.








Abstract
Following the first experimental realization of intrinsic ferromagnetism in 2D van der Waals (vdW) crystals, several ternary metal chalcogenides with unprecedented long&#8208;range ferromagnetic order have been explored. However, the synthesis of large&#8208;area 2D ternary metal chalcogenide thin films is a great challenge, and a generalized synthesis has not been demonstrated yet. Here, a quick and scalable synthesis of epitaxially aligned ferromagnetic ternary metal chalcogenide thin films (Cr2Ge2Te6, Cr2Si2Te6, Mn3Si2Te6) is reported. The synthesis is based on the flux&#8208;controlled surface diffusion of Te on metal (Cr, Mn)&#8208;deposited wafer (Ge, Si) substrates. Magnetic anisotropy study of the epitaxial ternary thin films reveals the intrinsic magnetic easy axis; out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction for Cr2Ge2Te6 and Cr2Si2Te6, and in&#8208;plane direction for Mn3Si2Te6. In addition to the synthesis, this work creates an opportunity for transfer&#8208;free device fabrication for realizing magnetoelectronics based on the electrical control of both charge and spin degrees of freedom in 2D ferromagnetic semiconductors.

         <title>Nickelate Superconductivity without Rare&#8208;Earth Magnetism: (La,Sr)NiO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By refining the synthesis of high&#8208;quality thin films, a superconducting dome is observed in La1&#8722;xSrxNiO2. Perhaps more surprisingly, undoped LaNiO2 also shows a strong indication of superconductivity. A generalized superconducting dome can be obtained by combining the La/Pr/Nd systems, revealing systematic shifts in the unit cell volume and the relative electron&#8208;hole population across the lanthanides.








Abstract
The occurrence of unconventional superconductivity in cuprates has long motivated the search for manifestations in other layered transition metal oxides. Recently, superconductivity is found in infinite&#8208;layer nickelate (Nd,Sr)NiO2 and (Pr,Sr)NiO2 thin films, formed by topotactic reduction from the perovskite precursor phase. A topic of much current interest is whether rare&#8208;earth moments are essential for superconductivity in this system. In this study, it is found that with significant materials optimization, substantial portions of the La1&#8722;xSrxNiO2 phase diagram can enter the regime of coherent low&#8208;temperature transport (x&#160;= 0.14 &#8208; 0.20), with subsequent superconducting transitions and a maximum onset of &#8776;9 K at x&#160;= 0.20. Additionally, the unexpected indication of a superconducting ground state in undoped LaNiO2 is observed, which likely reflects the self&#8208;doped nature of the electronic structure. Combining the results of (La/Pr/Nd)1&#8722;xSrxNiO2 reveals a generalized superconducting dome, characterized by systematic shifts in the unit cell volume and in the relative electron&#8208;hole populations across the lanthanides.

         <title>Monolayer Support Control and Precise Colloidal Nanocrystals Demonstrate Metal&#8211;Support Interactions in Heterogeneous Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interactions between coexisting metal and metal oxide phases determine the properties of heterogeneous catalysts. Atomic layer deposition and colloidal nanocrystal synthesis are combined to precisely control catalyst properties with sub&#8208;nanometer precision. Significant enhancements are observed in methane combustion activity after modification of SiO2 support with only one monolayer of Al2O3, and surface versus bulk contributions of metal&#8211;support interactions are explored.








Abstract
Electronic and geometric interactions between active and support phases are critical in determining the activity of heterogeneous catalysts, but metal&#8211;support interactions are challenging to study. Here, it is demonstrated how the combination of the monolayer&#8208;controlled formation using atomic layer deposition (ALD) and colloidal nanocrystal synthesis methods leads to catalysts with sub&#8208;nanometer precision of active and support phases, thus allowing for the study of the metal&#8211;support interactions in detail. The use of this approach in developing a fundamental understanding of support effects in Pd&#8208;catalyzed methane combustion is demonstrated. Uniform Pd nanocrystals are deposited onto Al2O3/SiO2 spherical supports prepared with control over morphology and Al2O3 layer thicknesses ranging from sub&#8208;monolayer to a &#8776;4&#160;nm thick uniform coating. Dramatic changes in catalytic activity depending on the coverage and structure of Al2O3 situated at the Pd/Al2O3 interface are observed, with even a single monolayer of alumina contributing an order of magnitude increase in reaction rate. By building the Pd/Al2O3 interface up layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer and using uniform Pd nanocrystals, this work demonstrates the importance of controlled and tunable materials in determining metal&#8211;support interactions and catalyst activity.

         <title>Polydopamine Nanobottles with Photothermal Capability for Controlled Release and Related Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polydopamine nanobottles with strong optical absorption are fabricated and then explored as a versatile platform for the encapsulation and controlled release of various types of cargos, including small molecules and biomacromolecules.








Abstract
Nanobottles refer to colloidal particles featuring a hollow body connected to a single opening on the surface. This unique feature makes them ideal carriers for the encapsulation and controlled release of various types of cargos. Here a facile route to the fabrication of uniform nanobottles made of polydopamine by leveraging swelling&#8208;induced pressure is reported. When polystyrene spheres are coated with polydopamine and then incubated with a toluene/water emulsion, the polystyrene will be swollen to automatically poke a single hole in the shell because of the pressure inside the shell. After quenching the swelling with ethanol and then removing all the polystyrene with tetrahydrofuran, polydopamine nanobottles are obtained. The dimensions of the hollow body are determined by the polystyrene template, while the size of the opening can be tuned by varying the shell thickness. Through the opening, different types of cargos, including small molecules and biomacromolecules, can be easily loaded with a thermoresponsive material into the cavity. The cargos can be released in a controllable manner through direct heating or polydopamine&#8208;enabled photothermal heating. In a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiment, the polydopamine nanobottles are used for temperature&#8208;controlled release of thrombin to trigger the formation of fibrin gels in situ.

         <title>Ultrathin Covalent Organic Framework Membranes via a Multi&#8208;Interfacial Engineering Strategy for Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;interfacial engineering strategy, that is, layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer interfacial growth of two covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with different pore sizes on another relatively large&#8208;pore COF film, is proposed to form narrowed apertures at the COF&#8211;COF interfaces. One prepared ultrathin COF membrane displays H2 permeance of 2163 gas permeation units (GPU) and a H2/CO2 selectivity of 26, transcending the 2008 Robeson upper bound.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising membrane materials due to their high porosity, ordered arrangements, and high stability. However, the relatively large pore size and complicated membrane preparation processes of COFs limit their applications in sieving small gas molecules, even at a lab scale. Herein, a multi&#8208;interfacial engineering strategy is proposed, that is, direct layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer interfacial reaction of two COFs (TpPa&#8208;SO3H and TpTGCl) with different pore sizes to form narrowed apertures at the COF&#8211;COF interfaces atop a relatively large&#8208;pore COF (COF&#8208;LZU1) film. At 423 K, one fabricated 155 nm&#8208;thick ultrathin COF membrane displays H2 permeance as high as 2163 gas permeation units (GPU) and a H2/CO2 selectivity of 26, transcending the 2008 Robeson upper bound. This strategy not only provides high&#8208;performance membrane candidates for H2 separation, but also enlightens the interfacial engineering and pore engineering manipulation for other COFs, porous polymers, and their membranes.

         <title>Highly Selective Adsorption of Carbon Dioxide over Acetylene in an Ultramicroporous Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The partially desolvated Cu&#8208;F&#8208;pymo can exclusively capture CO2 over C2H2 with very high selectivity. Sorption experiments and modeling studies reveal that such a molecular sieving effect is attributed to the suppression of C2H2 adsorption by residual water molecules. The inverse separation is further confirmed by column breakthrough studies given that highly pure acetylene (&gt;99.9%) can be directly harvested.








Abstract
Separating carbon dioxide from fuel gases like hydrocarbons by physical adsorbents is industrially important and more energy&#8208;efficient than traditional liquid extraction or cryogenic distillation methods. It is very important while very challenging to develop CO2&#8208;selective adsorbents, considering CO2 is less polarizable than light hydrocarbon molecules, particularly those simultaneously with almost identical molecular dimensions and physical properties, such as acetylene. Herein, an ultramicroporous metal&#8211;organic framework constructed from copper(II) and 5&#8208;fluoropyrimidin&#8208;2&#8208;olate, termed Cu&#8208;F&#8208;pymo, is carefully studied under different activations for inverse separation of CO2 from C2H2. The partially desolvated Cu&#8208;F&#8208;pymo can exclusively capture CO2 over C2H2 with very high selectivity exceeding 105 under ambient conditions, the highest ever reported.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separating carbon dioxide from fuel gases like hydrocarbons by physical adsorbents is industrially important and more energy-efficient than traditional liquid extraction or cryogenic distillation methods. It is very important while very challenging to develop CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-selective adsorbents, considering CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is less polarizable than light hydrocarbon molecules, particularly those simultaneously with almost identical molecular dimensions and physical properties, such as acetylene. Herein, an ultramicroporous metal&#8211;organic framework constructed from copper(II) and 5-fluoropyrimidin-2-olate, termed &lt;b&gt;Cu-F-pymo&lt;/b&gt;, is carefully studied under different activations for inverse separation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The partially desolvated &lt;b&gt;Cu-F-pymo&lt;/b&gt; can exclusively capture CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; over C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with very high selectivity exceeding 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; under ambient conditions, the highest ever reported. Sorption experiments and modeling studies reveal that such molecular sieving effect is attributed to the suppression of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption from the blockage of the preferential sites for C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by residual water molecules.

         <title>In&#8208;Materio Reservoir Computing in a Sulfonated Polyaniline Network</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sulfonated polyaniline (SPAN) organic electrochemical network device (OEND) that exhibits ionic conduction in a humid environment is used as an in&#8208;materio reservoir for reservoir computing (RC). The output behavior indicates wide variations for each electrode, which improves RC performance. Practical spoken&#8208;digit classification is realized with 60% accuracy, demonstrating that SPAN OEND can manage time series data operation in RC.








Abstract
A sulfonated polyaniline (SPAN) organic electrochemical network device (OEND) is fabricated using a simple drop&#8208;casting method on multiple Au electrodes for use in reservoir computing (RC). The SPAN network has humidity&#8208;dependent electrical properties. Under high humidity, the SPAN OEND exhibits mainly ionic conduction, including charging of an electric double layer and ionic diffusion. The nonlinearity and hysteresis of the current&#8211;voltage characteristics progressively increase with increasing humidity. The rich dynamic output behavior indicates wide variations for each electrode, which improves the RC performance because of the disordered network. For RC, waveform generation and short&#8208;term memory tasks are realized by a linear combination of outputs. The waveform task accuracy and memory capacity calculated from a short&#8208;term memory task reach 90% and 33.9, respectively. Improved spoken&#8208;digit classification is realized with 60% accuracy by only 12 outputs, demonstrating that the SPAN OEND can manage time series dynamic data operation in RC owing to a combination of rich dynamic and nonlinear electronic properties. The results suggest that SPAN&#8208;based electrochemical systems can be applied for material&#8208;based computing, by exploiting their intrinsic physicochemical behavior.

         <title>Molecular Dopant&#8208;Dependent Charge Transport in Surface&#8208;Charge&#8208;Transfer&#8208;Doped Tungsten Diselenide Field Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using three p&#8208;type molecular dopants with different electron affinities, charge transfer processes and the scattering effects induced by dopant molecules are directly related for understanding charge transport in molecular&#8208;doped tungsten diselenide channel. The authors&#8217; systematic investigation of the charge transport of doped transition metal dichalcogenides(TMDCs) reveals intrinsic molecular properties that can achieve efficient and controllable molecular doping in TMDCs.








Abstract
The controllability of carrier density and major carrier type of transition metal dichalcogenides(TMDCs) is critical for electronic and optoelectronic device applications. To utilize doping in TMDC devices, it is important to understand the role of dopants in charge transport properties of TMDCs. Here, the effects of molecular doping on the charge transport properties of tungsten diselenide (WSe2) are investigated using three p&#8208;type molecular dopants, 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4&#8208;TCNQ), tris(4&#8208;bromophenyl)ammoniumyl hexachloroantimonate (magic blue), and molybdenum tris(1,2&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)ethane&#8208;1,2&#8208;dithiolene) (Mo(tfd&#8208;COCF3)3). The temperature&#8208;dependent transport measurements show that the dopant counterions on WSe2 surface can induce Coulomb scattering in WSe2 channel and the degree of scattering is significantly dependent on the dopant. Furthermore, the quantitative analysis revealed that the amount of charge transfer between WSe2 and dopants is related to not only doping density, but also the contribution of each dopant ion toward Coulomb scattering. The first&#8208;principles density functional theory calculations show that the amount of charge transfer is mainly determined by intrinsic properties of the dopant molecules such as relative frontier orbital positions and their spin configurations. The authors&#8217; systematic investigation of the charge transport of doped TMDCs will be directly relevant for pursuing molecular routes for efficient and controllable doping in TMDC nanoelectronic devices.

         <title>A Cascade Battery: Coupling Two Sequential Electrochemical Reactions in a Single Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cascade battery that couples two sequential electrochemical reactions in a single battery is proposed. It can more fully utilize the inactive reaction chamber than traditional batteries and bypass the challenges of thick solid electrode to access high areal capacity. The cascade battery design breaks the stereotype of conventional battery configuration, paving a way for constructing two&#8208;in&#8208;one batteries.








Abstract
Currently, rechargeable electrochemical batteries generally operate on one reversible electrochemical reaction during discharging and charging cycles. Here, a cascade battery that couples two sequential electrochemical reactions in a single battery is proposed. Such a concept is demonstrated in an aqueous Zn&#8211;S hybrid battery, where solid sulfur serves as the cathode in the first discharge step and the generated Cu2S catalyzes Cu2+ reduce to Cu/Cu2O to provide the second discharge step. The cascade battery shows many merits compared to traditional batteries. First, it integrates two batteries internally, eliminating the use of additional inactive connecting materials required for external integration. Second, it can more fully utilize the inactive reaction chamber of the battery than traditional batteries. Third, cascade battery can bypass the challenges of thick solid electrode to access high areal capacity. An ultrahigh areal capacity of 48&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 is achieved even at a low solid cathode loading (9.6&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2). The cascade battery design breaks the stereotype of conventional battery configuration, providing a paradigm for constructing two&#8208;in&#8208;one batteries.

         <title>Superior Flexibility in Oxide Ceramic Crystal Nanofibers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible ceramic nanofibers are fabricated using a ball&#8208;milling&#8208; and curved&#8208;drafting&#8208;assisted electrospinning technique. With this strategy, continuous TiO2 nanofibers, in which orderly assembled TiO2 nanocrystals are connected by twin or amorphous grain boundaries, are formed after sintering. The single nanofiber is knottable, while the nanofiber membrane can be folded without fracture, displaying properties associated with both soft and hard matter.








Abstract
Oxide crystal ceramics are commonly hard and brittle, when they are bent they typically fracture. Such mechanical response limits the use of these materials in emerging fields like wearable electronics. Here, a polymer&#8208;induced assembly strategy is reported to construct orderly assembled TiO2 crystals into continuous nanofibers that are stretchable, bendable, and even knottable. Ball&#8208;milling the spinning sol and curved&#8208;drafting the electrospun nanofibers significantly improve the molecular structural order and reduce pore defects in the precursor nanofibers. Using this method, continuous TiO2 nanofibers, in which orderly assembled TiO2 nanocrystals (brick) are connected by twin grain boundaries or an amorphous region (mortar), are formed after sintering. Mechanical measurements and finite element analysis simulation indicate that the dislocation slip of &#8220;bricks&#8221; and the elastic deformation of &#8220;mortar&#8221; render the nanofibers with a small bending rigidity of &#8776;22 mN and a small elastic modulus of &#8776;20.8 Gpa, thus displaying properties associated with both soft and hard matter. More importantly, the reported approach can be easily extended to synthesize a wide range of soft, yet tough ceramic membranes, such as ZrO2 and SiO2.

More importantly, the reported approach can be easily extended to synthesize a wide range of soft, yet tough ceramic membranes, such as ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Magneto&#8208;Responsive Microneedle Robots for Intestinal Macromolecule Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magneto&#8208;responsive microneedle&#8208;structured robots are developed by a Lego&#8208;brick&#8208;stacking&#8208;inspired multistage 3D fabrication strategy. Such microrobots contain a polarized magnetic substrate for remote guidance, needle tips for intestinal drug release, and a separable connection for tip&#8211;substrate detachment and substrate excretion. These microrobots perform well in delivering insulin to pigs and blood glucose control, indicating their potentials in effective oral macromolecule administration.








Abstract
Oral administration is the most convenient and commonly used approach for drug delivery, while it is still a challenge to overcome the complicated gastrointestinal barriers and realize efficient macromolecular drug absorption. Here, novel magneto&#8208;responsive microneedle robots are presented for efficient oral delivery of versatile macromolecules. These microneedle robots with three components of the magnetic substrate, the separable connection, and tips are generated by a Lego&#8208;brick&#8208;stacking&#8208;inspired multistage 3D fabrication strategy. With the assistance of commercial enteric capsule encapsulation, they can be taken orally and be released when entering the small intestine. Benefitting from their polarized magnetic substrate, the tips of the microneedle robots can orient to the small intestinal wall, overcome the barriers, insert into the tissue, and deliver encapsulated actives under specific magnetic fields. Besides, after the separable connection degrades, the tips can be left inside the tissue for continuous actives release, and the magnetic substrate can be excreted safely. Based on these features, the practical values of the microneedle robots are demonstrated by using them to orally deliver insulin and efficiently regulate the blood glucose of pigs. It is believed that the proposed microneedle robots can orally deliver diverse macromolecules and thus open a new chapter for oral administration.

         <title>Additively Manufactured Deformation&#8208;Recoverable and Broadband Sound&#8208;Absorbing Microlattice Inspired by the Concept of Traditional Perforated Panels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on traditional perforated panel concepts, a novel broadband sound&#8208;absorbing microlattice with impact&#8208;recovery multifunctionality is presented herein. Microlattice boasts high averaged absorption coefficients of 0.77 with mechanisms attributing to synergistic impedance matching and a combination of viscous, thermal, and structural damping dissipation. It is also pseudo&#8208;reusable with high strain recovery at 30% with no degradation of sound absorption observed.








Abstract
Noise pollution is a highly detrimental daily health hazard. Sound absorbers, such as the traditionally used perforated panels, find widespread applications. Nonetheless, modern product designs call for material novelties with enhanced performance and multifunctionality. The advent of additive manufacturing has brought about the possibilities of functional materials design to be based on structures rather than chemistry. With this in mind, herein, the traditional concept of perforated panels is revisited and is incorporated with additive manufacturing for the development of a novel microlattice&#8208;based sound absorber with additional impact resistance multifunctionality. The structurally optimized microlattice presents excellent broadband absorption with an averaged experimental absorption coefficient of 0.77 across a broad frequency range from 1000 to 6300&#160;Hz. Extensive simulation and experiments reveal absorption mechanisms to be based on viscous flow, thermal and structural damping dissipations while broadband capabilities to be on multiple resonance modes working in tandem. High deformation recovery up to 30% strain is also possible from the strut&#8208;based design and viscoelasticity of the base material. Overall, the excellent properties of the microlattice overcome tradeoffs commonly found in conventional absorbers. Additionally, this work aims to present a new paradigm: revisiting old concepts for the developments of novel materials using contemporary methods.

         <title>Dendritic CsSnI3 for Efficient and Flexible Near&#8208;Infrared Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The injection and transport capacity of holes is significantly stronger than electrons in the CsSnI3&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes; therefore, the charge injection is manipulated by preparing a dendritic CsSnI3 structure, increasing the interface area of perovskite/electron&#8208;transporter and the probability of radiative recombination. As a result, an efficient device is achieved with a record external quantum efficiency of 5.4%.








Abstract
All&#8208;inorganic and lead&#8208;free CsSnI3 is emerging as one of the most promising candidates for near&#8208;infrared perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (NIR Pero&#8208;LEDs), which find practical applications including facial recognition, biomedical apparatus, night vision camera, and Light Fidelity. However, in the CsSnI3&#8208;based Pero&#8208;LEDs, the holes injection is significantly higher than that of electrons, resulting in unbalanced charge injection, undesired exciton dissipation, and poor device performance. Herein, it is proposed to manage charge injection and recombination behavior by tuning the interface area of perovskite and charge&#8208;transporter. A dendritic CsSnI3 structure is prepared on the hole&#8208;transporter, only making a bottom contact with the hole&#8208;transporter and exposing all other available crystal surfaces to the electron&#8208;transporter. In other words, the interface area of perovskite/electron&#8208;transporter is significantly higher than that of perovskite/hole&#8208;transporter. Moreover, the embedding interface of perovskite/electron&#8208;transporter can spatially confine holes and electrons, increasing the radiation recombination. By taking advantage of the dendritic structure, efficient lead&#8208;free NIR Pero&#8208;LEDs are achieved with a record external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 5.4%. More importantly, the dendritic structure shows great superiorities in flexible devices, for there is almost no morphology change after 2000&#8208;cycles of bends, and the fabricated Pero&#8208;LEDs can keep 93.4% of initial EQEs after 50&#8208;cycles of bends.

         <title>Additives for Ambient 3D Printing with Visible Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rapid visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced polymerization of commercially relevant acrylics and concomitant 3D printing under ambient conditions is made possible with thiol additives acting as oxygen scavengers. The tadpole and frog are 3D printed using energy efficient red light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), metaphorically representing the transformative advance that allows additive manufacturing (or breathing for the frog) in air.








Abstract
With 3D printing, the desire is to be &#8220;limited only by imagination,&#8221; and although remarkable advancements have been made in recent years, the scope of printable materials remains narrow compared to other forms of manufacturing. Light&#8208;driven polymerization methods for 3D printing are particularly attractive due to unparalleled speed and resolution, yet the reliance on high&#8208;energy UV/violet light in contemporary processes limits the number of compatible materials due to pervasive absorption, scattering, and degradation at these short wavelengths. Such issues can be addressed with visible&#8208;light photopolymerizations. However, these lower&#8208;energy methods often suffer from slow reaction times and sensitivity to oxygen, precluding their utility in 3D printing processes that require rapid hardening (curing) to maximize build speed and resolution. Herein, multifunctional thiols are identified as simple additives to enable rapid high&#8208;resolution visible&#8208;light 3D printing under ambient (atmospheric O2) conditions that rival modern UV/violet&#8208;based technology. The present process is universal, providing access to commercially relevant acrylic resins with a range of disparate mechanical responses from strong and stiff to soft and extensible. Pushing forward, the insight presented within this study will inform the development of next&#8208;generation 3D&#8208;printing materials, such as multicomponent hydrogels and composites.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With 3D printing, the desire is to be &#8220;limited only by imagination,&#8221; and although remarkable advancements have been made in recent years, the scope of printable materials remains narrow compared to other forms of manufacturing. Light-driven polymerization methods for 3D printing are particularly attractive due to unparalleled speed and resolution, yet the reliance on high-energy UV/violet light in contemporary processes limits the number of compatible materials due to pervasive absorption, scattering, and degradation at these short wavelengths. Such issues can be addressed with visible-light photopolymerizations. However, these lower-energy methods often suffer from slow reaction times and sensitivity to oxygen, precluding their utility in 3D printing processes that require rapid hardening (curing) to maximize build speed and resolution. Herein, multifunctional thiols are identified as simple additives to enable rapid high-resolution visible-light 3D printing under ambient (atmospheric O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) conditions that rival modern UV/violet-based technology. The present process is universal, providing access to commercially relevant acrylic resins with a range of disparate mechanical responses from strong and stiff to soft and extensible. Pushing forward, the insight presented within this study will inform the development of next-generation 3D-printing materials, such as multicomponent hydrogels and composites.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultralow Thermal Conductivity, Multiband Electronic Structure and High Thermoelectric Figure of Merit in TlCuSe</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semiconductors with ultralow lattice thermal conductivities and high power factors at the same time are scarce but fundamentally interesting in understanding thermoelectric energy conversion. Herein, TlCuSe exhibiting intrinsically ultralow thermal conductivity (0.25 W m&#8211;1 K&#8211;1), a high power factor (11.6 &#956;W cm&#8211;1 K&#8211;1), and a high figure of merit ZT (1.9) at 643 K is described.








Abstract
The entanglement of lattice thermal conductivity, electrical conductivity, and Seebeck coefficient complicates the process of optimizing thermoelectric performance in most thermoelectric materials. Semiconductors with ultralow lattice thermal conductivities and high power factors at the same time are scarce but fundamentally interesting and practically important for energy conversion. Herein, an intrinsic p&#8208;type semiconductor TlCuSe that has an intrinsically ultralow thermal conductivity (0.25 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1), a high power factor (11.6&#160;&#181;W cm&#8722;1 K&#8722;2), and a high figure of merit, ZT (1.9) at 643 K is described. The weak chemical bonds, originating from the filled antibonding orbitals p&#8208;d* within the edge&#8208;sharing CuSe4 tetrahedra and long Tl&#63743;Se bonds in the PbClF&#8208;type structure, in conjunction with the large atomic mass of Tl lead to an ultralow sound velocity. Strong anharmonicity, coming from Tl+ lone&#8208;pair electrons, boosts phonon&#8211;phonon scattering rates and further suppresses lattice thermal conductivity. The multiband character of the valence band structure contributing to power factor enhancement benefits from the lone&#8208;pair electrons of Tl+ as well, which modify the orbital character of the valence bands, and pushes the valence band maximum off the &#915;&#8208;point, increasing the band degeneracy. The results provide new insight on the rational design of thermoelectric materials.

         <title>Long&#8208;Range Forces in Rock&#8208;Salt&#8208;Type Tellurides and How they Mirror the Underlying Chemical Bonding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 37, September 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Examining the chemical bonding in rock&#8208;salt&#8208;type IV&#8211;VI functional materials by projected force constants as derived from ab initio thermochemistry yields unusually strong long&#8208;range forces along the cubic lattice vectors, impossible to account for by either two&#8208;center covalent or ionic bonding. The full analysis, including orbital&#8208;based bonding descriptors, points toward hyperbonding, thereby explaining certain unique properties of this material class.








Abstract
Chemical bonding in main&#8208;group IV chalcogenides is an intensely discussed topic, easily understandable because of their remarkable physical properties that predestine these solid&#8208;state materials for their widespread use in, for instance, thermoelectrics and phase&#8208;change memory applications. The atomistic origin of their unusual property portfolio remains somewhat unclear, however, even though different and sometimes conflicting chemical&#8208;bonding concepts have been introduced in the recent years. Here, it is proposed that projecting phononic force&#8208;constant tensors for pairs of atoms along differing directions and ranges provide a suitable and quantitative descriptor of the bonding nature for these materials. In combination with orbital&#8208;based quantitative measures of covalency such as crystal orbital Hamilton populations (COHP), it is concluded that the well&#8208;established many&#8208;center and even n&#8208;center bonding is an appropriate picture of the underlying quantum&#8208;chemical bonding mechanism, supporting the recent proposal of hyperbonded phase&#8208;change materials.

         <title>Increasing Accessible Subsurface to Improving Rate Capability and Cycling Stability of Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 37, September 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heteroatom doping affects the interlayer spacing of the subsurface region much more than the bulk for carbonaceous nanoparticles. The increased accessible subsurface boosts the pseudocapacitive capacity and endows SRNDC&#8208;700 with excellent rate performance up to 50&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. This varies from diffusion&#8208;controlled capacity determinism and provides a novel design concept for doping carbonaceous material.








Abstract
Numerous studies have reported that the enhancement of rate capability of carbonaceous anode by heteroatom doping is due to the increased diffusion&#8208;controlled capacity induced by expanding interlayer spacing. However, percentage of diffusion&#8208;controlled capacity is less than 30% as scan rate is larger than 1&#160;mV s&#8722;1, suggesting there is inaccuracy in recognizing principle of improving rate capability of carbonaceous anode. In this paper, it is found that the heteroatom doping has little impact on interlayer spacing of carbon in bulk phase, meaning that diffusion&#8208;controlled capacity is hard to be enhanced by doping. After synergizing with tensile stress, however, the interlayer spacing in subsurface region is obviously expanded to 0.40&#160;nm, which will increase the thickness of accessible subsurface region at high current density. So SRNDC&#8208;700 electrodes display a high specific capacity of 160.6 and 69.5&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 20 and 50&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1, respectively. Additionally, the high reversibility of carbon structure insures ultralong cycling stability and hence attenuation of SRNDC&#8208;700 is only 0.0025% per cycle even at 10&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 for 6000 cycles. This report sheds new insight into mechanism of improving electrochemical performance of carbonaceous anode by doping and provides a novel design concept for doping carbon.

         <title>Crystallization by Amorphous Particle Attachment: On the Evolution of Texture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 37, September 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biogenic minerals are shown not only to provide key insight into material morphogenesis during crystallization by amorphous particle attachment but also to teach us fundamental new mechanisms that have a profound effect on textural evolution during non&#8208;classical crystal growth. A link between the emergence of texture and amorphous particle accretion rate is established.








Abstract
Crystallization by particle attachment (CPA) is a gradual process where each step has its own thermodynamic and kinetic constrains defining a unique pathway of crystal growth. An important example is biomineralization of calcium carbonate through amorphous precursors that are morphed into shapes and textural patterns that cannot be envisioned by the classical monomer&#8208;by&#8208;monomer approach. Here, a mechanistic link between the collective kinetics of mineral deposition and the emergence of crystallographic texture is established. Using the prismatic ultrastructure in bivalve shells as a model, a fundamental leap is made in the ability to analytically describe the evolution of form and texture of biological mineralized tissues and to design the structure and crystallographic properties of synthetic materials formed by CPA.

         <title>Highly Efficient Uniaxial In&#8208;Plane Stretching of a 2D Material via Ion Insertion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 37, September 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ion insertion in between the 2D layers of WTe2 is shown to induce an exotic crystallographic phase. This novel phase is linked to uniquely large uniaxial in&#8208;plane strain. On&#8208;chip electrochemical control over the lithium content in single flakes of WTe2 is demonstrated as an efficient, fast, and reversible way to control the strain, making LixWTe2 a promising microscale actuator.








Abstract
On&#8208;chip dynamic strain engineering requires efficient micro&#8208;actuators that can generate large in&#8208;plane strains. Inorganic electrochemical actuators are unique in that they are driven by low voltages (&#8776;1&#160;V) and produce considerable strains (&#8776;1%). However, actuation speed and efficiency are limited by mass transport of ions. Minimizing the number of ions required to actuate is thus key to enabling useful &#8220;straintronic&#8221; devices. Here, it is shown that the electrochemical intercalation of exceptionally few lithium ions into WTe2 causes large anisotropic in&#8208;plane strain: 5% in one in&#8208;plane direction and 0.1% in the other. This efficient stretching of the 2D WTe2 layers contrasts to intercalation&#8208;induced strains in related materials which are predominantly in the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction. The unusual actuation of LixWTe2 is linked to the formation of a newly discovered crystallographic phase, referred to as Td', with an exotic atomic arrangement. On&#8208;chip low&#8208;voltage (&lt;0.2&#160;V) control is demonstrated over the transition to the novel phase and its composition. Within the Td'&#8208;Li0.5&#8722;&#948;WTe2 phase, a uniaxial in&#8208;plane strain of 1.4% is achieved with a change of &#948; of only 0.075. This makes the in&#8208;plane chemical expansion coefficient of Td'&#8208;Li0.5&#8722;&#948;WTe2 far greater than of any other single&#8208;phase material, enabling fast and efficient planar electrochemical actuation.

         <title>Construction of a Porous Metal&#8211;Organic Framework with a High Density of Open Cr Sites for Record N2/O2 Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 37, September 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A N2&#8208;selective metal&#8211;organic framework material TYUT&#8208;96Cr, with dual open Cr (III) sites, record&#8208;high N2 capture capacity, and N2/O2 selectivity is developed, showing the highest separation performance, far beyond the current adsorbents. Importantly, this material displays ultrahigh structural stability under water, acid/base, and humidity conditions, being practically useful for O2 separation and purification in industry.








Abstract
The removal of low concentration N2 is of great significance and challenging in the industrial production of high&#8208;purity O2. Herein, a chromium&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework, namely, TYUT&#8208;96Cr, is reported, which has an unprecedented N2 capture capacity of 37.46 cm3 cm&#8722;3 and N2/O2 (5:95, v/v) selectivity up to 26.95 (298 K and 1 bar), thus setting new benchmarks for all reported metal&#8211;organic frameworks and commercially used ones (Li&#8208;LSX and 13X). Breakthrough experiments reveal that N2 can be directly extracted from various N2/O2 (79:21, 50:50, 5:95, and 1:99, v/v) mixtures by this material, affording a record&#8208;high O2&#8208;production scale with 99.99% purity. Density functional theory calculations and in situ infrared spectroscopy studies demonstrate that the high&#8208;density open Cr (III) sites in TYUT&#8208;96Cr can behave as effective Lewis acidic sites, thus resulting in a strong affinity toward N2. The high N2 adsorption selectivity, exceptional separation performance, and ultrahigh structural stability render this porous material with great potential for this important industrial application.

         <title>In Situ Chemical Lithiation Transforms Diamond&#8208;Like Carbon into an Ultrastrong Ion Conductor for Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 37, September 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ lithiated DLC/PP separator suppresses Li&#8208;dendrite growth and redistributes Li ions to render dendrite&#8208;free lithium deposition, which results in stable cycling of lithium plating/stripping (over 4500 h) at 3.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and more than 200 stable cycles at 0.2 C in a Li || LiNi0.5Co0.3Mn0.2O2 pouch cell with a cathode mass loading of &#8776;9&#160;mg cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Lithium (Li)&#8208;metal anodes are of great promise for next&#8208;generation batteries due to their high theoretical capacity and low redox potential. However, Li&#8208;dendrite growth during cycling imposes a tremendous safety concern on the practical application of Li&#8208;metal anodes. Herein, an effective approach to suppress Li&#8208;dendrite growth by coating a polypropylene (PP) separator with a thin layer of ultrastrong diamond&#8208;like carbon (DLC) is reported. Theoretical calculations indicate that the DLC coating layer undergoes in situ chemical lithiation once assembled with the lithium&#8208;metal anode, transforming the DLC/PP separator into an excellent 3D Li&#8208;ion conductor. This in situ lithiated DLC/PP separator can not only mechanically suppress Li&#8208;dendrite growth by its intrinsically high modulus (&#8776;100&#160;GPa), but also uniformly redistributes Li ions to render dendrite&#8208;free lithium deposition. The twofold effects of the DLC/PP separator result in stable cycling of lithium plating/stripping (over 4500 h) at a high current density of 3&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Remarkably, this approach enables more than 1000 stable cycles at 5 C with a capacity retention of &#8776;71% in a Li || LiFePO4 coin cell and more than 200 stable cycles at 0.2 C in a Li || LiNi0.5Co0.3Mn0.2O2 pouch cell with cathode mass loading of &#8776;9&#160;mg cm&#8722;2.

         <title>The Wet&#8208;Oxidation of a Cu(111) Foil Coated by Single Crystal Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 37, September 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
As&#8208;grown graphene by chemical vapor deposition cannot protect the Cu surface from wet&#8208;oxidation because there is a diffusion pathway enabling water to diffuse from the graphene edges to the graphene/Cu interface: a &#8220;gap&#8221; between the graphene and each of the bunched Cu step corners. This interfacial diffusion of water is eliminated if ultraflat graphene is coating an ultrasmooth Cu(111) surface.








Abstract
The wet&#8208;oxidation of a single crystal Cu(111) foil is studied by growing single crystal graphene islands on it followed by soaking it in water. 18O&#8208;labeled water is also used; the oxygen atoms in the formed copper oxides in both the bare and graphene&#8208;coated Cu regions come from water. The oxidation of the graphene&#8208;coated Cu regions is enabled by water diffusing from the edges of graphene along the bunched Cu steps, and along some graphene ripples where such are present. This interfacial diffusion of water can occur because of the separation between the graphene and the &#8220;step corner&#8221; of bunched Cu steps. Density functional theory simulations suggest that adsorption of water in this gap is thermodynamically stable; the &#8220;step&#8208;induced&#8208;diffusion model&#8221; also applies to graphene&#8208;coated Cu surfaces of various other crystal orientations. Since bunched Cu steps and graphene ripples are diffusion pathways for water, ripple&#8208;free graphene is prepared on ultrasmooth Cu(111) surfaces and it is found that the graphene completely shields the underlying Cu from wet&#8208;oxidation. This study greatly deepens the understanding of how a graphene&#8208;coated copper surface is oxidized, and shows that graphene completely prevents the oxidation when that surface is ultrasmooth and when the graphene has no ripples or wrinkles.

         <title>Mechanochromic, Structurally Colored, and Edible Hydrogels Prepared from Hydroxypropyl Cellulose and Gelatin</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 37, September 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;supporting and structurally colored hydrogel is produced by combining hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) and gelatin in a scalable formulation process. By retaining the lyotropic, liquid crystalline behavior of the HPC into the gelled state, a spectrum of dynamic colors is produced. Rheological studies confirm a desirable non&#8208;Newtonian shear&#8208;thinning behavior and an increased stiffness, which result in a much quicker mechanochromic relaxation time.








Abstract
Hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) is an edible, cost&#8208;effective and widely used derivative of cellulose. Under lyotropic conditions in water, HPC forms a photonic, liquid crystalline mesophase with an exceptional mechanochromic response. However, due to insufficient physical cross&#8208;linking photonic HPC can flow freely as a viscous liquid, preventing the exploitation of this mechanochromic material in the absence of any external encapsulation or structural confinement. Here this challenge is addressed by mixing HPC and gelatin in water to form a self&#8208;supporting, viscoelastic, and edible supramolecular photonic hydrogel. It is demonstrated that the structural coloration, mechanochromism and non&#8208;Newtonian shear&#8208;thinning behavior of the lyotropic HPC solutions can all be retained into the gel state. Moreover, the rigidity of the HPC&#8208;gel provides a 69% shorter mechanochromic relaxation time back to its initial color when compared to the liquid HPC&#8211;water only system, broadening the dynamic color range of HPC by approximately 2.5&#215; in response to a compressive pressure. Finally, the ability to formulate the HPC&#8208;gels in a scalable fashion from only water and &#8220;food&#8208;grade&#8221; constituents unlocks a wide range of potential applications, from response&#8209;tunable mechanochromic materials and colorant&#8208;free food decoration, to short&#8208;term sensors in, for example, biodegradable &#8220;smart labels&#8221; for food packaging.

         <title>Arsenene Nanodots with Selective Killing Effects and their Low&#8208;Dose Combination with &#223;&#8208;Elemene for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 37, September 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
PEGylated arsenene nanodots (AsNDs@PEG) with high monoelemental arsenic purity and negligible systemic toxicity are identified as a new&#8208;concept arsenical drug for selectively treating solid tumors through the valence&#8208;change of arsenic to generate toxic oxidation states and on&#8208;demand photothermal therapy. This work can encourage a fast&#8208;paced clinical translation of arsenene for tumor treatments with potentially low attrition rates.








Abstract
Arsenical drugs have achieved hallmark success in treating patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia, but expanding their clinical utility to solid tumors has proven difficult with the contradiction between the therapeutic efficacy and the systemic toxicity. Here, leveraging efforts from materials science, biocompatible PEGylated arsenene nanodots (AsNDs@PEG) with high monoelemental arsenic purity that can selectively and effectively treat solid tumors are synthesized. The intrinsic selective killing effect of AsNDs@PEG is closely related to high oxidative stress in tumor cells, which leads to an activated valence&#8208;change of arsenic (from less toxic As0 to severely toxic oxidation states), followed by decreased superoxide dismutase activity and massive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. These effects occur selectively within cancer cells, causing mitochondrial damage, cell&#8208;cycle arrest, and DNA damage. Moreover, AsNDs@PEG when applied in a multi&#8208;drug combination strategy with &#946;&#8208;elemene, a plant&#8208;derived anticancer drug, achieves synergistic antitumor outcomes, and its newly discovered on&#8208;demand photothermal properties facilitate the elimination of the tumors without recurrence, potentially further expanding its clinical utility. In line of the practicability for a large&#8208;scale fabrication and negligible systemic toxicity of AsNDs@PEG (even at high doses and with repetitive administration), a new&#8208;concept arsenical drug with high therapeutic efficacy for selective solid tumor therapy is provided.

         <title>High&#8208;Resolution Imaging of Human Viruses in Liquid Droplets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 37, September 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first high&#8208;resolution view of biological assemblies contained in a liquid environment is presented. The foundation for analyzing structure and dynamics of soft materials in real&#8208;time and in 3D is established.








Abstract
Liquid&#8208;phase electron microscopy (LP&#8208;EM) is an exciting new area in the materials imaging field, providing unprecedented views of molecular processes. Time&#8208;resolved insights from LP&#8208;EM studies are a strong complement to the remarkable results achievable with other high&#8208;resolution techniques. Here, the opportunities to expand LP&#8208;EM technology beyond 2D temporal assessments and into the 3D regime are described. The results show new structures and dynamic insights of human viruses contained in minute volumes of liquid while acquired in a rapid timeframe. To develop this strategy, adeno&#8208;associated virus (AAV) is used as a model system. AAV is a well&#8208;known gene therapy vehicle with current applications involving drug delivery and vaccine development for COVID&#8208;19. Improving the understanding of the physical properties of biological entities in a liquid state, as maintained in the human body, has broad societal implications for human health and disease.

         <title>Controllable Heterojunctions with a Semicoherent Phase Boundary Boosting the Potassium Storage of CoSe2/FeSe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 37, September 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modulation of the crystal orientation allows an effective way to control the electrical properties of a heterojunction. By engineering the heterointerfaces, rich vacancies and ultrafine CoSe2&#8211;FeSe2 heterojunctions with semicoherent phase boundary are simultaneously obtained. The smart design not only modifies the electronic structure but also boosts the K+ diffusion.








Abstract
Heterostructure construction is an efficient method for reinforcing K+ storage of transition metal selenides. The spontaneously developed internal electric fields give a strong boost to charge transport and significantly reduce the activation energy. Nevertheless, perfection of the interfacial region based on the energy level gradient and lattice matching degree is still a great challenge. Herein, rich vacancies and ultrafine CoSe2&#8211;FeSe2 heterojunctions with semicoherent phase boundary are simultaneously obtained, which possess unique electronic structures and abundant active sites. When employed as anodes for potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs), CoSe2&#8211;FeSe2@C composites display a reversible potassium storage of 401.1 mAh g&#8722;1 at 100&#160;mA g&#8722;1 and even 275 mAh g&#8722;1 at 2 A g&#8722;1. Theoretical calculation also reveals that the potassium&#8208;ion diffusion can be dramatically promoted by the controllable CoSe2&#8211;FeSe2 heterojunction.

         <title>Domino Reaction Encoded Heterogeneous Colloidal Microswarm with On&#8208;Demand Morphological Adaptability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 37, September 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomimetic colloidal swarm system, is developed, which can synchronously traverse complex environments through adaptive transformation and perform multitasks with domino reaction&#8208;enhanced efficiency through specialization and cooperation between building blocks, thus contributing to the development of multifunctional microswarm and the applications of micro/nanorobots for targeted therapy.








Abstract
Emulating natural swarm intelligence with group&#8208;level functionality in artificial micro/nanorobotic systems offers an opportunity to sublimate the limited functions of individuals and revolutionize their applications. However, achieving synchronous operation of microswarms with environmental adaptability and cooperative tasking capability remains a challenge.

&lt;p&gt;A biomimetic colloidal swarm system, is developed, which can synchronously traverse complex environments through adaptive transformation and perform multitasks with domino reaction-enhanced efficiency through specialization and cooperation between building blocks, thus contributing to the development of multifunctional microswarm and the applications of micro/nanorobots for targeted therapy.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emulating natural swarm intelligence with group-level functionality in artificial micro/nanorobotic systems offers an opportunity to sublimate the limited functions of individuals and revolutionize their applications. However, achieving synchronous operation of microswarms with environmental adaptability and cooperative tasking capability remains a challenge. Here, an adaptive and heterogeneous colloidal magnetic microswarm with domino reaction encoded cooperative functions is presented. Through programming external magnetic fields, the system self-organizes into two swarm states, that is, vortex and ribbon microswarms, which can switch between each other reversibly within seconds, allowing to traverse tortuous, branched, and confined environments through adaptive morphological transformation. By specializing subgroups of building blocks with separate functions, cooperative tasking capability is integrated into the heterogeneous system following a &#8220;division of labor&#8221; manner. Given targeted therapy as a proof-of-concept task, the coordinated delivery of heterogeneous colloidal system across a complex environment with an access rate higher than 90% is demonstrated, and the specialization and cooperation between building blocks to disrupt multiple growth pathways of cancer cells via domino reaction are realized. The reconfigurable microswarm with hierarchical functionality presents a bioinspired approach to adapt to environmental variations and address multitasking requirements, which advances the development of microrobotic swarms and promises major benefits in biomedical fields.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Designing Shape Morphing Behavior through Local Programming of Mechanical Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 37, September 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different kinds of shape morphing are realized with programmable materials. Therefore, processing functions as well as if&#8208;then&#8208;else&#8208;conditions are implemented in unit cells. Local geometrical adaptions allow controlling the global shape in dependency of a load amplitude. Combining these elements, (strain&#8208;dependent) shapes as well as a moving hillock are created within a material.








Abstract
Shape morphing implicates that a specific condition leads to a morphing reaction. The material thus transforms from one shape to another in a predefined manner. In this paper, not only the target shape but rather the evolution of the material's shape as a function of the applied strain is programmed. To rationalize the design process, concepts from informatics (processing functions, for example, Poisson's ratio (PR) as function of strain: &#957;&#160;= f(&#949;) and if&#8208;then&#8208;else conditions) will be introduced. Three types of shape morphing behavior will be presented: (1) achieving a target shape by linearly increasing the amplitude of the shape, (2) filling up a target shape in linear steps, and (3) shifting a bulge through the material to a target position. In the first case, the shape is controlled by a geometric gradient within the material. The filling kind of behavior was&#160;implemented by logical operations. Moreover, programming moving hillocks (3) requires to implement a sinusoidal function &#949;y&#160;= sin&#8201;(&#949;x) and an if&#8208;then&#8208;else statement into the unit cells combined with a global stiffness gradient. The three cases will be used to show how the combination of mechanical mechanisms as well as the related parameter distribution enable a programmable shape morphing behavior in an inverse design&#160;process.

         <title>Intracellular Dynamic Assembly of Deep&#8208;Red Emitting Supramolecular Nanostructures Based on the Pt&#8230;Pt Metallophilic Interaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 37, September 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of molecular platinum complexes are described that, in the presence of serum proteins, self&#8208;assemble via the metallophilic interaction. The resulting nanoaggregates are deep&#8208;red emissive; they cross the cell membranes by endocytosis, but instead of following the regular lysosome&#8208;assisted pathway, directly end up in the mitochondria.








Abstract
Many drug delivery systems end up in the lysosome because they are built from covalent or kinetically inert supramolecular bonds. To reach other organelles, nanoparticles hence need to either be made from a kinetically labile interaction that allows re&#8208;assembly of the nanoparticles inside the cell following endocytic uptake, or, be taken up by a mechanism that short&#8208;circuits the classical endocytosis pathway. In this work, the intracellular fate of nanorods that self&#8208;assemble via the Pt&#8230;Pt interaction of cyclometalated platinum(II) compounds, is studied. These deep&#8208;red emissive nanostructures (638&#160;nm excitation, &#8776;700&#160;nm emission) are stabilized by proteins in cell medium. Once in contact with cancer cells, they cross the cell membrane via dynamin&#8208; and clathrin&#8208;dependent endocytosis. However, time&#8208;dependent confocal colocalization and cellular electron microscopy demonstrate that they directly move to mitochondria without passing by the lysosomes. Altogether, this study suggests that Pt&#8230;Pt interaction is strong enough to generate emissive, aggregated nanoparticles inside cells, but labile enough to allow these nanostructures to reach the mitochondria without being trapped in the lysosomes. These findings open new venues to the development of bioimaging nanoplatforms based on the Pt&#8230;Pt interaction.

         <title>Engineering the Dynamics of Cell Adhesion Cues in Supramolecular Hydrogels for Facile Control over Cell Encapsulation and Behavior</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 37, September 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Slow&#8208; and fast&#8208;exchanging molecules are co&#8208;assembled into transient fibrous networks, forming supramolecular hydrogels. Modulating the ratio between these molecules can dictate the extent of dynamic behavior of the hydrogels and incorporated bioactive cues. The dynamic character of supramolecular building blocks and the tunability of this system are exploited for facile encapsulation of cellular components and control over their behavior.








Abstract
The extracellular matrix (ECM) forms through hierarchical assembly of small and larger polymeric molecules into a transient, hydrogel&#8208;like fibrous network that provides mechanical support and biochemical cues to cells. Synthetic, fibrous supramolecular networks formed via non&#8208;covalent assembly of various molecules are therefore potential candidates as synthetic mimics of the natural ECM, provided that functionalization with biochemical cues is effective. Here, combinations of slow and fast exchanging molecules that self&#8208;assemble into supramolecular fibers are employed to form transient hydrogel networks with tunable dynamic behavior. Obtained results prove that modulating the ratio between these molecules dictates the extent of dynamic behavior of the hydrogels at both the molecular and the network level, which is proposed to enable effective incorporation of cell&#8208;adhesive functionalities in these materials. Excitingly, the dynamic nature of the supramolecular components in this system can be conveniently employed to formulate multicomponent supramolecular hydrogels for easy culturing and encapsulation of single cells, spheroids, and organoids. Importantly, these findings highlight the significance of molecular design and exchange dynamics for the application of supramolecular hydrogels as synthetic ECM mimics.

         <title>Antiperovskite Gd3SnC: Unusual Coexistence of Ferromagnetism and Heavy Fermions in Gd Lattice</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 37, September 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electronically inverted structures with switched crystallographic positions of cations and anions from the original structure allow an exotic phenomenon to be accessed. Antiperovskite Gd3SnC exhibits unusual coexistence of ferromagnetism and heavy fermions, contradicting the common belief that heavy&#8208;fermion behavior cannot emerge in ferromagnetic 4f&#8208;block elements. These unusual phenomena originate from the mixed bonding nature of antiperovskite structure.








Abstract
Inverted structures of common crystal lattices, referred to as antistructures, are rare in nature due to their thermodynamic constraints imposed by the switched cation and anion positions in reference to the original structure. However, a stable antistructure formed with mixed bonding characters of constituent elements in unusual valence states can provide unexpected material properties. Here, a heavy&#8208;fermion behavior of ferromagnetic gadolinium lattice in Gd3SnC antiperovskite is reported, contradicting the common belief that ferromagnetic gadolinium cannot be a heavy&#8208;fermion system due to the deep energy level of localized 4f&#8208;electrons. The specific heat shows an unusually large Sommerfeld coefficient of &#8776;1114 mJ mol&#8722;1 K&#8722;2 with a logarithmic behavior of non&#8208;Fermi&#8208;liquid state. It is demonstrated that the heavy&#8208;fermion behavior in the non&#8208;Fermi&#8208;liquid state appears to arise from the hybridized electronic states of gadolinium 5d&#8208;electrons participating in metallic Gd&#63743;Gd and covalent Gd&#63743;C bonds. These results accentuate the unusual chemical bonds in CGd6 octahedra with the dual characters of gadolinium 5d&#8208;electrons for the emergence of heavy fermions.

         <title>A Barium Titanate&#8208;on&#8208;Oxide Insulator Optoelectronics Platform</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 37, September 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A barium&#8208;titanate&#8208;on&#8208;insulator platform with high&#8208;quality barium titanate single&#8208;crystal growth and excellent vertical optical confinement is introduced. The phase&#8208;transition temperature of barium titanate in the platform is extended to at least 700 &#176;C, which helps to avoid difficulties in device fabrication caused by heating, such as cracking. A low propagation loss is verified in the resultant fabricated waveguide.








Abstract
Electro&#8208;optic modulators are among the most important building blocks in optical communication networks. Lithium niobate, for example, has traditionally been widely used to fabricate high&#8208;speed optical modulators due to its large Pockels effect. Another material, barium titanate, nominally has a 50&#160;times stronger r&#8208;parameter and would ordinarily be a more attractive material choice for such modulators or other applications. In practice, barium titanate thin films for optical waveguide devices are usually grown on magnesium oxide due to its low refractive index, allowing vertical mode confinement. However, the crystal quality is normally degraded. Here, a group of scandate&#8208;based substrates with small lattice mismatch and low refractive index compared to that of barium titanate is identified, thus concurrently satisfying high crystal quality and vertical optical mode confinement. This work provides a platform for nonlinear on&#8208;chip optoelectronics and can be promising for waveguide&#8208;based optical devices such as Mach&#8211;Zehnder modulators, wavelength division multiplexing, and quantum optics&#8208;on&#8208;chip.

         <title>Double&#8208; to Single&#8208;Strand Transition Induces Forces and Motion in DNA Origami Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 37, September 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A designed pulling mechanism making use of the entropic spring behavior of single&#8208;stranded DNA is presented. Controlled and reversible motion of two arms of a nanoscale DNA origami structure is shown, resembling the arms of a jumping jack. The opening and closing of the arms are monitored with transmission electron microscopy, super&#8208;resolution microscopy, and dark&#8208;field analysis.








Abstract
The design of dynamic, reconfigurable devices is crucial for the bottom&#8208;up construction of artificial biological systems. DNA can be used as an engineering material for the de&#8208;novo design of such dynamic devices. A self&#8208;assembled DNA origami switch is presented that uses the transition from double&#8208; to single&#8208;stranded DNA and vice versa to create and annihilate an entropic force that drives a reversible conformational change inside the switch. It is distinctively demonstrated that a DNA single&#8208;strand that is extended with 0.34&#160;nm per nucleotide &#8211; the extension this very strand has in the double&#8208;stranded configuration &#8211; exerts a contractive force on its ends leading to large&#8208;scale motion. The operation of this type of switch is demonstrated via transmission electron microscopy, DNA&#8208;PAINT super&#8208;resolution microscopy and darkfield microscopy. The work illustrates the intricate and sometimes counter&#8208;intuitive forces that act in nanoscale physical systems that operate in fluids.

         <title>iSens: A Fiber&#8208;Based, Highly Permeable and Imperceptible Sensor Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 37, September 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Permeable sensors fabricated of paper or glass fibers for measuring the temperature and monitoring the curing of adhesives during production are fabricated. The paper substrate fits seamlessly into the wooden construction material, while in the case of composite materials the glass fibers themselves are electrically functionalized. This technology ushers  in a new generation of imperceptible sensors (iSens) and devices.








Abstract
Embedded sensors are key to optimizing processes and products; they collect data that allow time, energy, and materials to be saved, thereby reducing costs. After production, they remain in place and are used to monitor the long&#8208;term structural health of buildings or aircraft. Fueled by climate change, sustainable construction materials such as wood and fiber composites are gaining importance. Current sensors are not optimized for use with these materials and often act as defects that cause catastrophic failures. Here, flexible, highly permeable, and imperceptible sensors (iSens) are introduced that integrate seamlessly into a component. Their porous substrates are readily infused with adhesives and withstand harsh conditions. In situ resistive temperature measurements and capacitive sensing allows monitoring of adhesives curing as used in wooden structures and fiber composites. The devices also act as heating elements to reduce the hardening time of the glue. Results are analyzed using numerical simulations and theoretical analysis. The suggested iSens technology is widely applicable and represents a step towards realizing the Internet of Things for construction materials.

         <title>3D Laser Displays Based on Circularly Polarized Lasing from Cholesteric Liquid Crystal Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 37, September 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Full&#8208;color 3D laser displays are demonstrated on cholesteric liquid crystal arrays, which comprise two sets of red&#8211;green&#8211;blue (RGB) pixels to present two images with orthogonal circularly polarized laser emissions. Stereoscopic images can be generated in a viewer's mind by fusing the two images acquired by the left and right eyes, respectively.








Abstract
3D laser displays play an important role in next&#8208;generation display technologies owing to the ultimate visual experience they provide. Circularly polarized (CP) laser emissions, featuring optical rotatory power and invariability under rotations, are attractive for 3D displays due to potential in enhancing contrast ratio and comfortability. However, the lack of pixelated self&#8208;emissive CP microlaser arrays as display panels hinders the implementation of 3D laser displays. Here, full&#8208;color 3D laser displays are demonstrated based on CP lasing with inkjet&#8208;printed cholesteric liquid crystal (CLC) arrays as display panels. Individual CP lasers are realized by embedding fluorescent dyes into CLCs with their left&#8208;/right&#8208;handed helical superstructures serving as distributed feedback microcavities, bringing in ultrahigh circular polarization degree values (gem&#160;= 1.6). These CP microlaser pixels exhibit excellent far&#8208;field color&#8208;rendering features and a relatively large color gamut for high&#8208;fidelity displays. With these printed CLC red&#8211;green&#8211;blue (RGB) microlaser arrays serving as display panels, proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept full&#8208;color 3D laser displays are demonstrated via delivering images with orthogonal CP laser emissions into one's left and right eyes. These results provide valuable enlightenment for the development of 3D laser displays.

         <title>Ultrastrong and Ductile Soft Magnetic High&#8208;Entropy Alloys via Coherent Ordered Nanoprecipitates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 37, September 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrastrong and ductile bulk high&#8208;entropy alloys with excellent soft magnetic properties are achieved by introducing a high volume fraction of coherent and ordered nanoprecipitates into the alloy matrix. The high lattice coherency between the homogeneously dispersed nanoprecipitates and the alloy matrix creates only negligible distortion fields on magnetic domain wall motion and contributes significantly to the strength of the material.








Abstract
The lack of strength and damage tolerance can limit the applications of conventional soft magnetic materials (SMMs), particularly in mechanically loaded functional devices. Therefore, strengthening and toughening of SMMs is critically important. However, conventional strengthening concepts usually significantly deteriorate soft magnetic properties, due to Bloch wall interactions with the defects used for hardening. Here a novel concept to overcome this dilemma is proposed, by developing bulk SMMs with excellent mechanical and attractive soft magnetic properties through coherent and ordered nanoprecipitates (&lt;15&#160;nm) dispersed homogeneously within a face&#8208;centered cubic matrix of a non&#8208;equiatomic CoFeNiTaAl high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA). Compared to the alloy in precipitate&#8208;free state, the alloy variant with a large volume fraction (&gt;42%) of nanoprecipitates achieves significantly enhanced strength (&#8776;1526&#160;MPa) at good ductility (&#8776;15%), while the coercivity is only marginally increased (&lt;10.7&#160;Oe). The ordered nanoprecipitates and the resulting dynamic microband refinement in the matrix significantly strengthen the HEAs, while full coherency between the nanoprecipitates and the matrix leads at the same time to the desired insignificant pinning of the magnetic domain walls. The findings provide guidance for developing new high&#8208;performance materials with an excellent combination of mechanical and soft magnetic properties as needed for the electrification of transport and industry.

     alt="Ultrastrong and Ductile Soft Magnetic High-Entropy Alloys via Coherent Ordered Nanoprecipitates"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultrastrong and ductile bulk high-entropy alloys with excellent soft magnetic properties are achieved by introducing a high volume fraction of coherent and ordered nanoprecipitates into the alloy matrix. The high lattice coherency between the homogeneously dispersed nanoprecipitates and the alloy matrix creates only negligible distortion fields on magnetic domain wall motion and contributes significantly to the strength of the material.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lack of strength and damage tolerance can limit the applications of conventional soft magnetic materials (SMMs), particularly in mechanically loaded functional devices. Therefore, strengthening and toughening of SMMs is critically important. However, conventional strengthening concepts usually significantly deteriorate soft magnetic properties, due to Bloch wall interactions with the defects used for hardening. Here a novel concept to overcome this dilemma is proposed, by developing bulk SMMs with excellent mechanical and attractive soft magnetic properties through coherent and ordered nanoprecipitates (&amp;lt;15&#160;nm) dispersed homogeneously within a face-centered cubic matrix of a non-equiatomic CoFeNiTaAl high-entropy alloy (HEA). Compared to the alloy in precipitate-free state, the alloy variant with a large volume fraction (&amp;gt;42%) of nanoprecipitates achieves significantly enhanced strength (&#8776;1526&#160;MPa) at good ductility (&#8776;15%), while the coercivity is only marginally increased (&amp;lt;10.7&#160;Oe). The ordered nanoprecipitates and the resulting dynamic microband refinement in the matrix significantly strengthen the HEAs, while full coherency between the nanoprecipitates and the matrix leads at the same time to the desired insignificant pinning of the magnetic domain walls. The findings provide guidance for developing new high-performance materials with an excellent combination of mechanical and soft magnetic properties as needed for the electrification of transport and industry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>17.6%&#8208;Efficient Quasiplanar Heterojunction Organic Solar Cells from a Chlorinated 3D Network Acceptor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 37, September 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quasiplanar heterojunction (Q&#8208;PHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) based on D18 and BTIC&#8208;BO&#8208;4Cl with a 3D network are reported, yielding a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.60%. The results show that the Q&#8208;PHJ architecture can replace the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) architecture to realize excellent OSCs for certain unique donors and acceptors, giving an alternative approach for photovoltaic material design and device fabrication.








Abstract
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) have achieved great success because they overcome the shortcomings of short exciton diffusion distances. With the progress in material innovation and device technology, the efficiency of BHJ devices is continually being improved. For some special photovoltaic material systems, it is difficult to manipulate the miscibility and morphology of blend films, and this results in moderate, even poor device performance. Quasiplanar heterojunction (Q&#8208;PHJ) OSCs have been proposed to exploit the excellent photovoltaic properties of these materials. An OSC with BTIC&#8208;BO&#8208;4Cl has a 3D interpenetrating network structure with multiple channels that can facilitate the exciton diffusion and charge transport, and BTIC&#8208;BO&#8208;4Cl is therefore a good candidate for Q&#8208;PHJ OSCs. In this work, a D18:BTIC&#8208;BO&#8208;4Cl&#8208;based Q&#8208;PHJ device is fabricated. The exciton diffusion lengths of D18 and BTIC&#8208;BO&#8208;4Cl&#160;are in accord with&#160;the requirements of the Q&#8208;PHJ device and the efficiency of Q&#8208;PHJ device is as high as 17.60%. This study indicates that the Q&#8208;PHJ architecture can replace the BHJ architecture to produce excellent OSCs for certain unique donors and acceptors, providing an alternative approach to photovoltaic material design and device fabrication.

         <title>Regioregular Narrow&#8208;Bandgap n&#8208;Type Polymers with High Electron Mobility Enabling Highly Efficient All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 37, September 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regioregular narrow&#8208;bandgap n&#8208;type polymer, L15, is synthesized, showing higher electron mobility and larger absorption coefficient compared to its random analog. When applied as an electron acceptor in all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs), L15 yields outstanding efficiencies of 15.2% and 16.2% in binary and ternary all&#8208;PSCs, respectively.








Abstract
Narrow&#8208;bandgap n&#8208;type polymers with high electron mobility are urgently demanded for the development of all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs). Here, two regioregular narrow&#8208;bandgap polymer acceptors, L15 and MBTI, with two electron&#8208;deficient segments are synthesized by copolymerizing two dibrominated fused&#8208;ring electron acceptors (FREA) with distannylated aromatic imide, respectively. Taking full advantage of the FREA and the imide, both polymer acceptors show narrow bandgap and high electron mobility. Benefiting from the more extended absorption, better backbone ordering, and higher electron mobility than those of its regiorandom analog, the L15&#8208;based all&#8208;PSC yields a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.2% when blended with the polymer donor PM6. More importantly, MBTI incorporating a benzothiophene&#8208;core FREA segment shows relatively higher frontier molecular orbital levels than L15, forming a cascade&#8208;like energy level alignment with L15 and PM6. Based on this, ternary all&#8208;PSCs are designed where MBTI is introduced as a guest into the PM6:L15 host system. Thanks to further optimal blend morphology and more balanced charge transport, the PCE is improved up to 16.2%, which is among the highest values for all&#8208;PSCs. The results demonstrate that combining an FREA and an aromatic imide to construct regioregular narrow&#8208;bandgap polymer acceptors provides an effective approach to fabricate highly efficient all&#8208;PSCs.

         <dc:description>
Kinetics and dynamics of the crystallization of thermally evaporated amorphous Te films are studied. Single&#8208;crystalline tellurium arrays are demonstrated by controlling the crystallization pathway of the evaporated Te films. Field&#8208;effect transistors based on the evaporated Te single crystals exhibit an average effective hole mobility of &#8776;100 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and on/off ratio of &#8776;3 &#215; 104.








Abstract
Thermally evaporated tellurium possesses an intriguing crystallization behavior, where an amorphous to crystalline phase transition happens at near&#8208;ambient temperature. However, a comprehensive understanding and delicate control of the crystallization process for the evaporated Te films is lacking. Here, the kinetics and dynamics of the crystallization of thermally evaporated Te films is visualized and modeled. Low&#8208;temperature processing of highly crystalline tellurium films with large grain size and preferred out&#8208;of&#8208;plane orientation ((100) plane parallel to the surface) is demonstrated by controlling the crystallization process. Tellurium single crystals with a lateral dimension of up to 6&#160;&#181;m are realized on various substrates including glass and plastic. Field&#8208;effect transistors based on 5&#160;&#176;C crystallized Te single grains (6&#8208;nm&#8208;thick) exhibit an average effective hole mobility of &#8776;100 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, and on/off current ratio of &#8776;3 &#215; 104.

         <title>Au&#8208;Doped Ag2Te Quantum Dots with Bright NIR&#8208;IIb Fluorescence for In Situ Monitoring of Angiogenesis and Arteriogenesis in a Hindlimb Ischemic Model</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 37, September 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel near&#8208;infrared IIb fluorescent probe of Au&#8208;doped Ag2Te (Au:Ag2Te) quantum dots (QDs) is developed through a facile cation exchange method. The Au:Ag2Te QDs exhibit photoluminescence (PL) emission at 1600&#160;nm and a much&#8208;enhanced PL intensity of &#8776;12 fold compared to Ag2Te QDs at a doping amount of 4% (Au/Ag).








Abstract
Fluorescence located in 1500&#8211;1700&#160;nm (denoted as the near&#8208;infrared IIb window, NIR&#8208;IIb) has drawn great interest for bioimaging, owing to its ultrahigh tissue penetration depth and spatiotemporal resolution. Therefore, NIR&#8208;IIb fluorescent probes with high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and stability along with high biocompatibility are urgently pursued. Herein, a novel NIR&#8208;IIb fluorescent probe of Au&#8208;doped Ag2Te (Au:Ag2Te) quantum dots (QDs) is developed via a facile cation exchange method. The Au dopant concentration in the Ag2Te QDs is tunable from 0% to 10% by controlling the ratio of supplied Au precursor to Ag2Te QDs, resulting in a wide range of PL emission in the NIR&#8208;IIb window and a much&#8208;enhanced PL intensity. After surface modification, the Au:Ag2Te QDs possess bright NIR&#8208;IIb emission, high colloidal stability and photostability, and decent biocompatibility. Further, in vivo monitoring of the process of angiogenesis and arteriogenesis in an ischemic hindlimb is successfully performed.

Herein, a novel NIR-IIb fluorescent probe of Au-doped Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te (Au:Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te) quantum dots (QDs) is developed via a facile cation exchange method. The Au dopant concentration in the Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te QDs is tunable from 0% to 10% by controlling the ratio of supplied Au precursor to Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te QDs, resulting in a wide range of PL emission in the NIR-IIb window and a much-enhanced PL intensity. After surface modification, the Au:Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te QDs possess bright NIR-IIb emission, high colloidal stability and photostability, and decent biocompatibility. Further, in vivo monitoring of the process of angiogenesis and arteriogenesis in an ischemic hindlimb is successfully performed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High Resolution Patterning of an Organic&#8211;Inorganic Photoresin for the Fabrication of Platinum Microstructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 37, September 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;resolution patterning of an organic&#8211;inorganic platinum containing photoresin by microlithography and two&#8208;photon polymerization is demonstrated. The polymerized microstructures are debinded and reduced to highly conductive metallic platinum at a resolution of 300 nm. The conductivity of  the reduced platinum structures is 67% of the conductivity of bulk platinum.








Abstract
Platinum (Pt) is an interesting material for many applications due to its high chemical resilience, outstanding catalytic activity, high electrical conductivity, and high melting point. However, microstructuring and especially 3D microstructuring of platinum is a complex process, based on expensive and specialized equipment often suffering from very slow processing speeds. In this work, organic&#8211;inorganic photoresins, which can be structured using direct optical lithography as well as two&#8208;photon lithography (TPL) with submicrometer resolution and high&#8208;throughput is presented. The printed structures are subsequently converted to high&#8208;purity platinum using thermal debinding of the binder and reduction of the salt. With this technique, complex 3D structures with a 3D resolution of 300&#160;nm were&#160;fabricated. At a layer thickness of 35&#160;nm, the patterns reach a high conductivity of 67% compared to bulk platinum. Microheaters, thermocouple sensors as well as a Lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;Chip system are presented as exemplary applications. This technology will enable a broad range of application from electronics, sensing and heating elements to 3D photonics and metamaterials.

         <title>Ultrathin Multibridge Channel Transistor Enabled by van der Waals Assembly</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 37, September 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D ultrathin multibridge channel field&#8208;effect transistor (MBCFET), constructed based on 2&#160;nm/2&#160;nm MoS2 channels is demonstrated. This two&#8208;level&#8208;stacked MBCFET exhibits an on&#8211;off current ratio of up to 4&#160;&#215;&#160;108 with a theoretical minimum subthreshold swing value (60&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1) at room temperature.








Abstract
Multibridge channel field&#8208;effect transistors (MBCFETs) enable improved gate control and flow of a large drive current and they are regarded as promising candidates for next&#8208;generation transistor architecture. However, in achieving a larger drive current with a thinner channel, limitations arise from the decrease in mobility when the thickness of the Si nanosheet is less than 5&#160;nm. In addition, an increase in the leakage current is unavoidable when a large number of channels are stacked. Here, a 2D ultrathin MBCFET is demonstrate, constructed based on 2&#160;nm/2&#160;nm MoS2 channels. The normalized drive current (23.11 &#181;A*&#181;m&#160;&#181;m&#8722;1) in each level channel of this MBCFET exceeds that of the latest seven&#8208;level&#8208;stacked Si MBCFET, while the leakage current is only 0.4% of this value, with the subthreshold swing reaching 60&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1 and an on/off ratio reaching up to 4&#160;&#215;&#160;108 at room temperature. Furthermore, the drive current of this 2D ultrathin MBCFET can be further increased by regulating the polarity of the operation voltage to reduce the injection barrier. The combination of 2D materials and an MBC structure has the potential for use in high&#8208;performance and low&#8208;power&#8208;consumption electronics.

         <title>An Anti&#8208;Fatigue Design Strategy for 3D Ribbon&#8208;Shaped Flexible Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 37, September 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anti&#8208;fatigue strategy to significantly prolong the fatigue life of 3D ribbon&#8208;shaped flexible electronics by switching metal&#8208;dominated failure to the desired polymer&#8208;dominated failure is presented. Combined in situ measurements and computations allow the establishment of a failure criterion capable of accurately predicting fatigue life under compressions, thereby providing useful guidelines for the design of anti&#8208;fatigue mesostructures with diverse 3D geometries.








Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) flexible electronics represent an emerging area of intensive attention in recent years, owing to their broad&#8208;ranging applications in wearable electronics, flexible robots, tissue/cell scaffolds, among others. The widely adopted 3D conductive mesostructures in the functional device systems would inevitably undergo repetitive out&#8208;of&#8208;plane compressions during practical operations, and thus, anti&#8208;fatigue design strategies are of great significance to improve the reliability of 3D flexible electronics. Previous studies mainly focused on the fatigue failure behavior of planar ribbon&#8208;shaped geometries, while anti&#8208;fatigue design strategies and predictive failure criteria addressing 3D ribbon&#8208;shaped mesostructures are still lacking. This work demonstrates an anti&#8208;fatigue strategy to significantly prolong the fatigue life of 3D ribbon&#8208;shaped flexible electronics by switching the metal&#8208;dominated failure to desired polymer&#8208;dominated failure. Combined in situ measurements and computational studies allow the establishment of a failure criterion capable of accurately predicting fatigue lives under out&#8208;of&#8208;plane compressions, thereby providing useful guidelines for the design of anti&#8208;fatigue mesostructures with diverse 3D geometries. Two mechanically reliable 3D devices, including a resistance&#8208;type vibration sensor and a janus sensor capable of decoupled temperature measurements, serve as two demonstrative examples to highlight potential applications in long&#8208;term health monitoring and human&#8208;like robotic perception, respectively.

         <title>Strong Suppression of Thermal Conductivity in the Presence of Long Terminal Alkyl Chains in Low&#8208;Disorder Molecular Semiconductors</title>

         <dc:description>
A significant drop in in&#8208;plane thermal conductivity upon end alkylation of  the aromatic rings of dinaphtho[2,3&#8208;b:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;f]thieno[3,2&#8208;b] thiophene (DNTT), which is understood from a detailed vibrational&#8208;mode analysis, is identified via a comprehensive experimental and theoretical investigation. Combined with their enhanced charge transport, the results suggest the possibility of decoupling electron and phonon transport in alkylated DNTT systems, which opens pathways for improved thermoelectric applications.








Abstract
While the charge transport properties of organic semiconductors have been extensively studied over the recent years, the field of organics&#8208;based thermoelectrics is still limited by a lack of experimental data on thermal transport and of understanding of the associated structure&#8211;property relationships. To fill this gap, a comprehensive experimental and theoretical investigation of the lattice thermal conductivity in polycrystalline thin films of dinaphtho[2,3&#8208;b:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;f]thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene (Cn&#8208;DNTT&#8208;Cn with n&#160;= 0, 8) semiconductors is reported. Strikingly, thermal conductivity appears to be much more isotropic than charge transport, which is confined to the 2D molecular layers. A direct comparison between experimental measurements (3&#969;&#8211;V&#246;lklein method) and theoretical estimations (approach&#8208;to&#8208;equilibrium molecular dynamics (AEMD) method) indicates that the in&#8208;plane thermal conductivity is strongly reduced in the presence of the long terminal alkyl chains. This evolution can be rationalized by the strong localization of the intermolecular vibrational modes in C8&#8208;DNTT&#8208;C8 in comparison to unsubstituted DNTT cores, as evidenced by a vibrational mode analysis. Combined with the enhanced charge transport properties of alkylated DNTT systems, this opens the possibility to decouple electron and phonon transport in these materials, which provides great potential for enhancing the thermoelectric figure of merit ZT.

Spatial Structure Reconstruction
In article number 2100866, Jiangfeng Yang, Libo Li, and co&#8208;workers, through optimized spatial structure reconstruction, build TYUT&#8208;96Cr, composed of three kinds of small pore cages using Cr and trimesic acid. Benefitting from the high&#8208;density open Cr sites in the structure, this material features record N2 adsorption volume capacity and N2/O2 separation selectivity, and is practically useful for upmarket industrial applications.

Arsenical Drugs
In article number 2102054, Aiguo Wu, Tian Xie, Wei Tao, and co&#8208;workers reveal PEGylated arsenene nanodots (AsNDs@PEG) with high monoelemental arsenic purity and negligible systemic toxicity as a new&#8208;concept arsenical drug. This AsNDs@PEG, when applied in a low&#8208;dose combination strategy with &#946;&#8208;elemene, a plant&#8208;derived anticancer drug, achieves synergistic therapeutic outcomes.

Paper&#8208;Based Sensors
iSens are flexible, foldable, and translucent paper&#8208;based sensors. The porous substrates consist of a fiber structure that is highly permeable to liquids. Interdigital electrodes made of ultrathin copper are individually designed by one step laser ablation. This iSens platform, presented by Martin Kaltenbrunner and co&#8208;workers in article number 2102736, will contribute to a new generation of imperceptible sensors seamlessly integrated into smart composite materials.

Fatigue Life
In article number 2102684, Yihui Zhang and co&#8208;workers present an antifatigue strategy to prolong the fatigue life of 3D ribbon&#8208;shaped electronics by switching the metal&#8208;dominated failure to polymer&#8208;dominated. Combined measurements and computations allow establishment of a failure criterion capable of predicting fatigue life under compressions, thereby providing useful guidelines for the design of antifatigue flexible electronics with diverse 3D geometries.

         <title>Frontiers in Theoretical Analysis of Solid Electrolyte Interphase Formation Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 37, September 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nature of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formed on battery electrodes governs the performance and safety of current and post&#8208;Li&#8208;ion batteries. However, it has been unclear how reaction products of an electrolyte interact and aggregate to form the final SEI. The morphological growth mechanism of the SEI, as revealed by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art theoretical simulation methodologies, is highlighted.








Abstract
Solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is an ion conductive yet electron&#8208;insulating layer on battery electrodes, which is formed by the reductive decomposition of electrolytes during the initial charge. The nature of the SEI significantly impacts the safety, power, and lifetime of the batteries. Hence, elucidating the formation mechanism of the SEI layer has become a top priority. Conventional theoretical calculations reveal initial elementary steps of electrolyte reductive decomposition, whereas experimental approaches mainly focus on the characterization of the formed SEI in the final form. Moreover, both theoretical and experimental methodologies could not approach intermediate or transient steps of SEI growth. A major breakthrough has recently been achieved through a novel multiscale simulation method, which has enriched the understanding of how the reduction products are aggregated near the electrode and influence the SEI morphologies. This review highlights recent theoretical achievements to reveal the growth mechanism and provides a clear guideline for designing a stable SEI layer for advanced batteries.

         <title>Black Phosphorus/Polymers: Status and Challenges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 37, September 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent progress in black phosphorus/polymer (BP/polymers) research is highlighted, including the preparation methods, a comprehensive introduction of their prop erties, and a detailed account of their applications in optoelectronics, biomedicine, energy&#8208;storage devices, flame retardancy, and information storage. Forward&#8208;looking perspectives on the current challenges are also provided.








Abstract
As a newly emerged mono&#8208;elemental nanomaterial, black phosphorus (BP) has been widely investigated for its fascinating physical properties, including layer&#8208;dependent tunable band gap (0.3&#8211;1.5 eV), high ON/OFF ratio (104), high carrier mobility (103 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1), excellent mechanical resistance, as well as special in&#8208;plane anisotropic optical, thermal, and vibrational characteristics. However, the instability caused by chemical degradation of its surface has posed a severe challenge for its further applications. A focused BP/polymer strategy has more recently been developed and implemented to hurdle this issue, so at present BP/polymers have been developed that exhibit enhanced stability, as well as outstanding optical, thermal, mechanical, and electrical properties. This has promoted researchers to further explore the potential applications of black phosphorous. In this review, the preparation processes and the key properties of BP/polymers are reviewed, followed by a detailed account of their diversified applications, including areas like optoelectronics, bio&#8208;medicine, and energy storage. Finally, in accordance with the current progress, the prospective challenges and future directions are highlighted and discussed.

         <dc:description>
Bio&#8208;inspired materials have technical advantages in application as major components of secondary batteries as well as environmental and economic advantages. The recent research progress on utilization of biomaterials for electrodes, separators, and binders for the improvement of the performance of rechargeable batteries is highlighted and summarized. Current challenges and perspectives regarding the use of biomaterials for secondary batteries are given.








Abstract
Materials in nature have evolved to the most efficient forms and have adapted to various environmental conditions over tens of thousands of years. Because of their versatile functionalities and environmental friendliness, numerous attempts have been made to use bio&#8208;inspired materials for industrial applications, establishing the importance of biomimetics. Biomimetics have become pivotal to the search for technological breakthroughs in the area of rechargeable secondary batteries. Here, the characteristics of bio&#8208;inspired materials that are useful for secondary batteries as well as their benefits for application as the main components of batteries (e.g., electrodes, separators, and binders) are discussed. The use of bio&#8208;inspired materials for the synthesis of nanomaterials with complex structures, low&#8208;cost electrode materials prepared from biomass, and biomolecular organic electrodes for lithium&#8208;ion batteries are also introduced. In addition, nature&#8208;derived separators and binders are discussed, including their effects on enhancing battery performance and safety. Recent developments toward next&#8208;generation secondary batteries including sodium&#8208;ion batteries, zinc&#8208;ion batteries, and flexible batteries are also mentioned to understand the feasibility of using bio&#8208;inspired materials in these new battery systems. Finally, current research trends are covered and future directions are proposed to provide important insights into scientific and practical issues in the development of biomimetics technologies for secondary batteries.

         <title>Identification of the Key Parameters for Horizontal Transition Dipole Orientation in Fluorescent and TADF Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 37, September 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Horizontal emitter orientation can significantly increase the efficiency of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. Intense research over the past decade has provided a large amount of data on the factors that may drive horizontal orientation of organic emitters. This research is reviewed, and a meta&#8208;analysis of the data is combined with quantum&#8208;chemical calculations to identify key parameters that influence this orientation.








Abstract
In organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), horizontal orientation of the emissive transition dipole moment (TDM) can improve light outcoupling efficiency by up to 50% relative to random orientation. Therefore, there have been extensive efforts to identify drivers of horizontal orientation. The aspect ratio of the emitter molecule and the glass&#8208;transition temperature (Tg) of the films are currently regarded as particularly important. However, there remains a paucity of systematic studies that establish the extent to which these and other parameters control orientation in the wide range of emitter systems relevant for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art OLEDs. Here, recent work on molecular orientation of fluorescent and thermally activated delayed fluorescent emitters in vacuum&#8208;processed OLEDs is reviewed. Additionally, to identify parameters linked to TDM orientation, a meta&#8208;analysis of 203 published emitter systems is conducted and combined with density&#8208;functional theory calculations. Molecular weight (MW) and linearity are identified as key parameters in neat systems. In host&#8211;guest systems with low&#8208;MW emitters, orientation is mostly influenced by the host Tg, whereas the length and MW of the emitter become more relevant for systems involving higher&#8208;MW emitters. To close, a perspective of where the field must advance to establish a comprehensive model of molecular orientation is given.

         <title>Ultrafast Interlayer Charge Separation, Enhanced Visible&#8208;Light Absorption, and Tunable Overpotential in Twisted Graphitic Carbon Nitride Bilayers for Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taking g&#8208;C3N4 as a representative example, it is theoretically found that twisted bilayers are endowed with good charge separation, ultrafast interlayer charge transfer, and enhanced visible&#8208;light absorption. Due to the induced large moir&#233; potentials, the overpotentials of HER and OER on the twisted bilayers are significantly reduced. Therefore, twist is better and of great potential in catalysis.








Abstract
Moir&#233; pattern superlattice formed by 2D van der Waals layered structures have attracted great attention for diverse applications. In experiments, the enhancement of catalytic performance in twisted bilayer systems is reported while its mechanism remains unclear. From high&#8208;accuracy first&#8208;principles and time&#8208;dependent ab initio nonadiabatic molecular dynamics calculations, ultrafast interlayer charge transfer within 120 fs, excellent charge separation, improved visible&#8208;light absorption, and satisfactory overpotentials for the hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions in twisted graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) bilayers are found, which are beneficial to photocatalytic, photo&#8208;electrocatalytic, or electrocatalytic water splitting. This work provides insightful guidance to advanced nanocatalysis based on twisted layered materials.

         <title>Approaching Nearly 40% External Quantum Efficiency in Organic Light Emitting Diodes Utilizing a Green Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitter with an Extended Linear Donor&#8211;Acceptor&#8211;Donor Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A green thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitter with an extended &#960;&#8208;system of linear donor (D)&#8211;acceptor (A)&#8211;donor (D) structure is established to simultaneously obtain a horizontal emitting dipole orientation ratio of 92%, a reverse intersystem crossing rate of 1.16 &#215; 106 s&#8211;1 and a photoluminescence quantum yield of 95%, together affording a champion maximum external quantum efficiency of 39.1%.








Abstract
Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters featuring preferential horizontal emitting dipole orientation (EDO) are in urgent demand for enhanced optical outcoupling efficiency in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). However, simultaneously manipulating EDO and optoelectronic properties remains a formidable challenge. Here, an extended linear D&#8211;A&#8211;D structure with both enlarged donor (D) and acceptor (A) &#960;&#8208;systems is established, not only elaborately manipulating parallel horizontal molecular orientation and EDO along its long axis by multi&#8208;driving&#8208;forces for a high horizontal dipole ratio (&#920;//), but also delocalizing distribution of frontier energy levels for optimized electronic properties. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;concept emitter simultaneously affords a high &#920;// of 92%, a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 95%, and a fast reverse intersystem crossing rate of 1.16 &#215; 106 s&#8208;1. The corresponding OLED achieves a champion maximum external quantum efficiency of 39.1% among all green TADF devices without any external light&#8208;extraction techniques, together with a maximum power efficiency of 112.0&#160;lm W&#8208;1 and alleviated efficiency roll&#8208;off. These findings may inspire even better full&#8208;color TADF emitters that push the device efficiency toward the theoretical limits.

         <title>Singlet Oxygen &#8220;Afterglow&#8221; Therapy with NIR&#8208;II Fluorescent Molecules</title>

By comparison of three different boron dipyrromethene compounds, the heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free 10&#8208;(anthracen&#8208;9&#8208;yl)&#8208;3,7&#8208;bis((E)&#8208;4&#8208;(diphenylamino)styryl)&#8208;5,5&#8208;difluoro&#8208;1,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;5H&#8208;dipyrrolo[1,2&#8208;c:2&#8220;,1&#8221; f][1,3,2] diazaborinin&#8208;4&#8208;ium&#8208;5&#8208;uide is used for near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II fluorescence&#8208;imaging&#8208;guided phototherapy, in which the anthracene module is able to capture singlet oxygen with laser irradiation and release it in the dark condition for &#8220;afterglow&#8221; photodynamic therapy, leading to the complete suppression of tumor.








Abstract
Improving singlet oxygen (1O2) lifespan by fractionated delivery in dark and hypoxic conditions is a better way to achieve enhanced phototherapeutic efficacy. Herein, three boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) dyes are synthesized to demonstrate that anthracence&#8208;functionalized BODIPY, namely ABDPTPA is an efficient heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free photosensitizer for the reversible capture and release of 1O2. The spin&#8211;orbit charge&#8208;transfer intersystem crossing of ABDPTPA promises a high 1O2 quantum yield of 60% in dichloromethane. Under light irradiation, the anthracene group reacts with 1O2 to produce endoperoxide. Interestingly, after termination of irradiation, the endoperoxide undergoes thermal cycloreversion to produce 1O2, and regenerates the anthracene module to achieve 1O2 &#8220;afterglow,&#8221; which results in a prolonged half lifetime of 1O2 for 9.2&#160;min. In vitro cytotoxicity assays indicate that ABDPTPA nanoparticles have a low half&#8208;maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 3.6&#160;&#181;g mL&#8722;1 on U87MG cells. Further, the results of near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II fluorescence&#8208;imaging&#8208;guided phototherapy indicate that ABDPTPA nanoparticles can inhibit tumor proliferation even at a low dose (200&#160;&#181;g mL&#8722;1, 100&#160;&#181;L) without any side effects. Therefore, the study provides a generalized 1O2 &#8220;afterglow&#8221; strategy to enhance phototheranostics for complete tumor regression.

         <title>Efficient and Stable CsPbI3 Inorganic Perovskite Photovoltaics Enabled by Crystal Secondary Growth</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Defect&#8208;triggered phase degradation has become the main issue in the field of inorganic CsPbI3 perovskite. A crystal secondary growth of inorganic perovskites induced by a solid&#8208;state reaction to achieve defect compensation in CsPbI3 perovskite is demonstrated. Finally, the defect&#8208;compensated CsPbI3&#8208;based solar cell delivers 20.04% efficiency with excellent operational stability.








Abstract
Defect&#8208;triggered phase degradation is generally considered as the main issue that causes phase instability and limited device performance for CsPbI3 inorganic perovskites. Here, a defect compensation in CsPbI3 perovskite through crystal secondary growth of inorganic perovskites is demonstrated, and highly efficient inorganic photovoltaics are realized. This secondary growth is achieved by a solid&#8208;state reaction between a bromine salt and defective CsPbI3 perovskite. Upon solid&#8208;state reaction, the Br&#8722; ions can diffuse over the entire CsPbI3 perovskite layer to heal the undercoordinated Pb2+ and conduct certain solid&#8208;state I/Br ion exchange reaction, while the organic cations can potentially heal the Cs+ cation vacancies through coupling with [PbI6]4&#8722; octahedra. The carrier dynamics confirm that this crystal secondary growth can realize defect compensation in CsPbI3. The as&#8208;achieved defect&#8208;compensated CsPbI3 not only improves the charge dynamics but also enhances the photoactive phase stability. Finally, the CsPbI3&#8208;based solar cell delivers 20.04% efficiency with excellent operational stability. Overall, this work proposes a novel concept of defect compensation in inorganic perovskites through crystal secondary growth induced by solid&#8208;state reaction that is promising for various optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Miniaturized VIS&#8208;NIR Spectrometers Based on Narrowband and Tunable Transmission Cavity Organic Photodetectors with Ultrahigh Specific Detectivity above 1014 Jones</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new concept of innovative transmission cavities combined with organic photodetectors (OPDs) is proposed to achieve narrowband photodetection from VIS to the NIR region. With this approach, an ultrahigh specific detectivity above 1014 Jones is achieved and has been integrated into a miniaturized spectrometer, representing a significant step towards applying OPDs as an attractive alternative for mobile spectrometric sensing.








Abstract
Spectroscopic photodetection plays a key role in many emerging applications such as context&#8208;aware optical sensing, wearable biometric monitoring, and biomedical imaging. Photodetectors based on organic semiconductors open many new possibilities in this field. However, ease of processing, tailorable optoelectronic properties, and sensitivity for faint light are still significant challenges. Here, the authors report a novel concept for a tunable spectral detector by combining an innovative transmission cavity structure with organic absorbers to yield narrowband organic photodetection in the wavelength range of 400&#8211;1100&#160;nm, fabricated in a full&#8208;vacuum process. Benefiting from this strategy, one of the best performed narrowband organic photodetectors is achieved with a finely wavelength&#8208;selective photoresponse (full&#8208;width&#8208;at&#8208;half&#8208;maximum of &#8776;40&#160;nm), ultrahigh specific detectivity above 1014 Jones, the maximum response speed of 555&#160;kHz, and a large dynamic range up to 168&#160;dB. Particularly, an array of transmission cavity organic photodetectors is monolithically integrated on a small substrate to showcase a miniaturized spectrometer application, and a true proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept transmission spectrum measurement is successfully demonstrated. The excellent performance, the simple device fabrication as well as the possibility of high integration of this new concept challenge state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art low&#8208;noise silicon photodetectors and will mature the spectroscopic photodetection into technological realities.

         <title>Bioinspired Multifunctional Glass Surfaces through Regenerative Secondary Mask Lithography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A difficulty of bioinspired nanostructuring in glass is addressed by regenerative secondary mask lithography, a facile and versatile fabrication concept utilizing dynamic nanoscale tunability of the side&#8208;wall profile and aspect ratio, leading to customized nanoarrays. Such nanopatterning affords antireflectance and the ability to repel water/fog and bacteria, highly desired in many applications&#8212;from displays to automotive and architectural windows.








Abstract
Nature&#8208;inspired nanopatterning offers exciting multifunctionality spanning antireflectance and the ability to repel water/fog, oils, and bacteria; strongly dependent upon nanofeature size and morphology. However, such patterning in glass is notoriously difficult, paradoxically, due to the same outstanding chemical and thermal stability that make glass so attractive. Here, regenerative secondary mask lithography is introduced and exploited to enable customized glass nanopillars through dynamic nanoscale tunability of the side&#8208;wall profile and aspect ratio (&gt;7). The method is simple and versatile, comprising just two steps. First, sub&#8208;wavelength scalable soft etch masks (55&#8211;350&#160;nm) are generated through an example of block copolymer micelles or nanoimprinted photoresist. Second, their inherent durability problem is addressed by an innovative cyclic etching, when the original mask becomes embedded within a protective secondary organic mask, which is tuned and regenerated, permitting dynamic nanofeature profiling with etching selectivity &gt;1:32.&#160;It is envisioned that such structuring in glass will facilitate fundamental studies and be useful for numerous practical applications&#8212;from displays to architectural windows. To showcase the potential, glass features are tailored to achieve excellent broadband omnidirectional antireflectivity, self&#8208;cleaning, and unique antibacterial activity toward Staphylococcus aureus.

         <title>Robust Jumping Actuator with a Shrimp&#8208;Shell Architecture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is highly desirable to develop compact and robust jumping robots that can withstand severe conditions. This paper reports a film jumping actuator, which exhibits shrimp&#8208;shell architecture, from a conjugated ladder polymer (cLP) connected by carbon nanotube (CNT) sheets. The hierarchical porous structure ensures fast absorption and desorption of organic vapor, thereby achieving a high response rate.








Abstract
It is highly desirable to develop compact&#8208; and robust&#8208;film jumping robots that can withstand severe conditions. Besides, the demands for strong actuation force, large bending curvature in a short response time, and good environmental tolerance are significant challenges to the material design. To address these challenges, this paper reports the fabrication of a thin&#8208;film jumping actuator, which exhibits a shrimp&#8208;shell architecture, from a conjugated ladder polymer (cLP) that is connected by carbon nanotube (CNT) sheets. The hierarchical porous structure ensures the fast absorption and desorption of organic vapor, thereby achieving a high response rate. The actuator does not exhibit shape distortion at temperatures of up to 225&#160;&#176;C and in concentrated sulfuric acid, as well as when immersed in many organic solvents. This work avails a new design strategy for high&#8208;performance actuators that function under harsh and complicated conditions.

         <title>Phase&#8211;Property Diagrams for Multicomponent Oxide Systems toward Materials Libraries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Development of phase&#8211;property diagrams and materials libraries via automated synthesis and characterization techniques integrated with machine learning are presented here. The multicomponent phase&#8211;property diagram (materials library) closes the loop and it is used to determine suitable candidates for a desired property, or to narrow specific regions to initiate further studies. Theoretically predicted multicomponent materials can be used as an external input.








Abstract
Exploring the vast compositional space offered by multicomponent systems or high entropy materials using the traditional route of materials discovery, one experiment at a time, is prohibitive in terms of cost and required time. Consequently, the development of high&#8208;throughput experimental methods, aided by machine learning and theoretical predictions will facilitate the search for multicomponent materials in their compositional variety. In this study, high entropy oxides are fabricated and characterized using automated high&#8208;throughput techniques. For intuitive visualization, a graphical phase&#8211;property diagram correlating the crystal structure, the chemical composition, and the band gap are introduced. Interpretable machine learning models are trained for automated data analysis and to speed up data comprehension. The establishment of materials libraries of multicomponent systems correlated with their properties (as in the present work), together with machine learning&#8208;based data analysis and theoretical approaches are opening pathways toward virtual development of novel materials for both functional and structural applications.

         <title>Interfacial Laser&#8208;Induced Graphene Enabling High&#8208;Performance Liquid&#8722;Solid Triboelectric Nanogenerator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monolithic fabrication of a flexible droplet&#8208;based electricity generator (DEG) is demonstrated by in situ growth of laser&#8208;induced graphene electrodes with different hydrophobicity in a fluorinated ethylene propylene&#8208;coated polyimidebilayer structure. The DEG exhibits high power conversion efficiency, lighting up 480 LEDs with one water droplet. More importantly, the DEG exhibits superior cyclability and operational stability under high humidity and various pH conditions.








Abstract
Laser&#8208;induced graphene (LIG) has emerged as a promising and versatile method for high&#8208;throughput graphene patterning; however, its full potential in creating complex structures and devices for practical applications is yet to be explored. In this study, an in&#8208;situ growing LIG process that enables to pattern superhydrophobic fluorine&#8208;doped graphene on fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP)&#8208;coated polyimide (PI) is demonstrated. This method leverages on distinct spectral responses of FEP and PI during laser excitation to generate the environment preferentially for LIG formation, eliminating the need for multistep processes and specific atmospheres. The structured and water&#8208;repellant structures rendered by the spectral&#8208;tuned interfacial LIG process are suitable as the electrode for the construction of a flexible droplet&#8208;based electricity generator (DEG), which exhibits high power conversion efficiency, generating a peak power density of 47.5 W m&#8722;2 from the impact of a water droplet 105&#160;&#181;L from a height of 25&#160;cm. Importantly, the device exhibits superior cyclability and operational stability under high humidity and various pH conditions. The facile process developed can be extended to realize various functional devices.

The structured and water-repellant structures rendered by the spectral-tuned interfacial LIG process are suitable as the electrode for the construction of a flexible droplet-based electricity generator (DEG), which exhibits high power conversion efficiency, generating a peak power density of 47.5 W m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; from the impact of a water droplet 105&#160;&#181;L from a height of 25&#160;cm. Importantly, the device exhibits superior cyclability and operational stability under high humidity and various pH conditions. The facile process developed can be extended to realize various functional devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interfacial Model Deciphering High&#8208;Voltage Electrolytes for High Energy Density, High Safety, and Fast&#8208;Charging Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a new solvation structure&#8208;related interfacial model is presented, involving the molecular&#8208;scale interactions between the lithium&#8208;ion, anion, and solvents on the electrolyte&#8211;electrode surface, to interpret the high performance enabled by newly designed high voltage electrolyte. This report is a pioneering study that explores the dynamic mutual&#8208;interaction interfacial behaviors on the Ni&#8208;rich cathode and graphite anode simultaneously in the battery.








Abstract
High&#8208;voltage lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) enabled by high&#8208;voltage electrolytes can effectively boost energy density and power density, which are critical requirements to achieve long travel distances, fast&#8208;charging, and reliable safety performance for electric vehicles. However, operating these batteries beyond the typical conditions of LIBs (4.3&#160;V&#160;vs Li/Li+) leads to severe electrolyte decomposition, while interfacial side reactions remain elusive. These critical issues have become a bottleneck for developing electrolytes for applications in extreme conditions. Herein, an additive&#8208;free electrolyte is presented that affords high stability at high voltage (4.5&#160;V&#160;vs&#160;Li/Li+), lithium&#8208;dendrite&#8208;free features upon fast&#8208;charging operations (e.g., 162&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 3&#160;C), and superior long&#8208;term battery performance at low temperature. More importantly, a new solvation structure&#8208;related interfacial model is presented, incorporating molecular&#8208;scale interactions between the lithium&#8208;ion, anion, and solvents at the electrolyte&#8211;electrode interfaces to help interpret battery performance. This report is a pioneering study that explores the dynamic mutual&#8208;interaction interfacial behaviors on the lithium layered oxide cathode and graphite anode simultaneously in the battery. This interfacial model enables new insights into electrode performances that differ from the known solid electrolyte interphase approach to be revealed, and sets new guidelines for the design of versatile electrolytes for metal&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Quantitative Coassembly for Precise Synthesis of Mesoporous Nanospheres with Pore Structure&#8208;Dependent Catalytic Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A quantitative coassembly approach is developed for synthesizing carbon/silica composite and its derived porous carbon spheres. This approach enables precise control of the pore structure of the carbon spheres and revelation of their structure&#8211;performance relationships in catalysis. The small and long pores significantly enhance the performance of carbon spheres in catalytic water decontamination.








Abstract
Precise synthesis of porous materials is essential for their applications. Self&#8208;assembly is a widely used strategy for synthesizing porous materials, but quantitative control of the assembly process still remains a great challenge. Here, a quantitative coassembly approach is developed for synthesizing resin/silica composite and its derived porous spheres. The assembly behaviors of the carbon and silica precursors are regulated without surfactants and the growth kinetics of the composite spheres are quantitatively controlled. This assembly approach enables the precise control of the size and pore structures of the derived carbon spheres. These carbon spheres provide a good platform to explore the structure&#8211;performance relationships of porous materials, and demonstrate their pore structure&#8208;dependent performance in catalytic water decontamination. This work provides a simple and robust approach for precise synthesis of porous spheres and brings insights into function&#8208;oriented design of porous materials.

         <title>Atomically Isolated Rh Sites within Highly Branched Rh2Sb Nanostructures Enhance Bifunctional Hydrogen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A class of Rh2Sb nanocrystals with unique multiple branches features (denoted as Rh2Sb NBs) and atomically isolated Rh sites have been developed for efficient hydrogen electrocatalysis. The unsaturated Rh sites on the surface of Rh2Sb NBs have the unique superiority for improving alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction and hydrogen oxidation reaction activity in comparison to pure Rh NBs. Strikingly, Rh2Sb NBs can exhibit excellent CO tolerance during HOR.








Abstract
Breaking the bottleneck of hydrogen oxidation/evolution reactions (HOR/HER) in alkaline media is of tremendous importance for the development of anion exchange membrane fuel cells/water electrolyzers. Atomically dispersed active sites are known to exhibit excellent activity and selectivity toward diverse catalytic reactions. Here, a class of unique Rh2Sb nanocrystals with multiple nanobranches (denoted as Rh2Sb NBs) and atomically dispersed Rh sites are reported as promising electrocatalysts for alkaline HOR/HER. Rh2Sb NBs/C exhibits superior HER performance with a low overpotential and a small Tafel slope, outperforming both Rh NBs/C and commercial Pt/C. Significantly, Rh2Sb NBs show outstanding HOR performance of which the HOR specific activity and mass activity are about 9.9 and 10.1 times to those of Rh NBs/C, and about 4.2 and 3.7 times to those of Pt/C, respectively. Strikingly, Rh2Sb NBs can also exhibit excellent CO tolerance during HOR, whose activity can be largely maintained even at 100&#8201;ppm CO impurity. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the unsaturated Rh sites on Rh2Sb NBs surface are crucial for the enhanced alkaline HER and HOR activities. This work provides a unique catalyst design for efficient hydrogen electrocatalysis, which is critical for the development of alkaline fuel cells and beyond.

         <title>Disentangling Ferroelectric Wall Dynamics and Identification of Pinning Mechanisms via Deep Learning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The domain dynamics in model polycrystalline materials is explored using a workflow combining deep&#8208;learning&#8208;based segmentation of the visualized domain structures and rotationally invariant autoencoders (rVAE). The former allows unambiguous identification and classification of the ferroelectric and ferroelastic domain walls. The rVAE stage further identifies intrinsic mechanisms of switching that can be compared to simple physical models.








Abstract
Field&#8208;induced domain&#8208;wall dynamics in ferroelectric materials underpins multiple applications ranging from actuators to information technology devices and necessitates a quantitative description of the associated mechanisms including giant electromechanical couplings, controlled nonlinearities, or low coercive voltages. While the advances in dynamic piezoresponse force microscopy measurements over the last two decades have rendered visualization of polarization dynamics relatively straightforward, the associated insights into the local mechanisms have been elusive. This work explores the domain dynamics in model polycrystalline materials using a workflow combining deep&#8208;learning&#8208;based segmentation of the domain structures with nonlinear dimensionality reduction using multilayer rotationally invariant autoencoders (rVAE). The former allows unambiguous identification and classification of the ferroelectric and ferroelastic domain walls. The rVAE discovers the latent representations of the domain wall geometries and their dynamics, thus providing insight into the intrinsic mechanisms of polarization switching, that can further be compared to simple physical models. The rVAE disentangles the factors affecting the pinning efficiency of ferroelectric walls, offering insights into the correlation of ferroelastic wall distribution and ferroelectric wall pinning.

         <title>Chaotic Organic Crystal Phosphorescent Patterns for Physical Unclonable Functions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chaotic phosphorescent patterns are developed based on an organic crystal and MoS2 heterostructure for physical unclonable functions (PUFs). The phosphorescent patterns on the MoS2 seem similar on the macroscopic scale, whereas each organic crystal exhibits highly disorder features on the microscopic scale. In image analysis, the encoding capacity as a single PUF domain achieves more than 1017 on a MoS2 small fragment.








Abstract
Since the 4th Industrial Revolution, Internet of Things based environments have been widely used in various fields ranging from mobile to medical devices. Simultaneously, information leakage and hacking risks have also increased significantly, and secure authentication and security systems are constantly required. Physical unclonable functions (PUF) are in the spotlight as an alternative. Chaotic phosphorescent patterns are developed based on an organic crystal and atomic seed heterostructure for security labels with PUFs. Phosphorescent organic crystal patterns are formed on MoS2. They seem similar on a macroscopic scale, whereas each organic crystal exhibits highly disorder features on the microscopic scale. In image analysis, an encoding capacity as a single PUF domain achieves more than 1017 on a MoS2 small fragment with lengths of 25&#160;&#181;m. Therefore, security labels with phosphorescent PUFs can offer superior randomness and no&#8208;cloning codes, possibly becoming a promising security strategy for authentication processes.

&lt;p&gt;Since the 4th Industrial Revolution, Internet of Things based environments have been widely used in various fields ranging from mobile to medical devices. Simultaneously, information leakage and hacking risks have also increased significantly, and secure authentication and security systems are constantly required.

Chaotic phosphorescent patterns are developed based on an organic crystal and atomic seed heterostructure for security labels with PUFs.

         <title>Liquid Crystal Elastomers with Enhanced Directional Actuation to Electric Fields</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stimuli&#8208;responsive materials are compelling approaches to advance the capabilities of soft robots as artificial muscles. Here, a material chemistry is reported to prepare liquid crystal elastomers with a fivefold increase in directional actuation response to electric fields. Electromechanical deformation of liquid crystal elastomers is shown to be rapid and locally programmable.








Abstract
The integration of soft, stimuli&#8208;responsive materials in robotic systems is a promising approach to introduce dexterous and delicate manipulation of objects. Electrical control of mechanical response offers many benefits in robotic systems including the availability of this energy input, the associated response time, magnitude of actuation, and opportunity for self&#8208;regulation. Here, a materials chemistry is detailed to prepare liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) with a 14:1 modulus contrast and increase in dielectric constant to enhance electromechanical deformation. The inherent modulus contrast of these LCEs (when coated with compliant electrodes) directly convert an electric field to a directional expansion of 20%. The electromechanical response of LCE actuators is observed upon application of voltage ranging from 0.5 to 6&#160;kV. The deformation of these materials is rapid, reaching strain rates of 18% s&#8722;1. Upon removal of the electric field, little hysteresis is observed. Patterning the spatial orientation of the nematic director of the LCEs results in a 2D&#8211;3D shape transformation to a cone 8&#160;mm in height. Individual and sequential addressing of an array of LCE actuators is demonstrated as a haptic surface.

         <title>Graphene Oxide&#8208;Supported Microwell Grids for Preparing Cryo&#8208;EM Samples with Controlled Ice Thickness</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An advanced Si&#8208;chip&#8208;based device having a regular array of micropatterned holes with graphene oxide (GO) window is developed for precise regulation of vitreous ice thickness in cryogenic&#8208;electron microscopy, establishing efficient and high&#8208;throughput structure analysis. Various nanoscale biological samples, as well as inorganic materials are imaged and near&#8208;atomic single particle 3D reconstruction is succeeded using GO&#8208;supported microwell grid.








Abstract
Cryogenic&#8208;electron microscopy (cryo&#8208;EM) is the preferred method to determine 3D structures of proteins and to study diverse material systems that intrinsically have radiation or air sensitivity. Current cryo&#8208;EM sample preparation methods provide limited control over the sample quality, which limits the efficiency and high throughput of 3D structure analysis. This is partly because it is difficult to control the thickness of the vitreous ice that embeds specimens, in the range of nanoscale, depending on the size and type of materials of interest. Thus, there is a need for fine regulation of the thickness of vitreous ice to deliver consistent high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios for low&#8208;contrast biological specimens. Herein, an advanced silicon&#8208;chip&#8208;based device is developed which has a regular array of micropatterned holes with a graphene oxide (GO) window on freestanding silicon nitride (SixNy). Accurately regulated depths of micropatterned holes enable precise control of vitreous ice thickness. Furthermore, GO window with affinity for biomolecules can facilitate concentration of the sample molecules at a higher level. Incorporation of micropatterned chips with a GO window enhances cryo&#8208;EM imaging for various nanoscale biological samples including human immunodeficiency viral particles, groEL tetradecamers, apoferritin octahedral, aldolase homotetramer complexes, and tau filaments, as well as inorganic materials.

         <title>Limiting the Uncoordinated N Species in M&#8211;Nx Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts toward Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction in Broad Voltage Range</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) supported on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon may contain miscellaneous structures on the support, leading to misinterpretations of catalytic behavior. Here the Ni&#8211;Nx SACs in which 80% of N dopants are coordinated with Ni atoms are synthesized via joule heating to demonstrate unprecedented activity, selectivity, and stability toward electrocatalytic CO2 reduction in a broad voltage range.








Abstract
Carbon&#8208;supported single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are extensively studied because of their outstanding activity and selectivity toward a wide range of catalytic reactions. Amidst its development, excess dopants (e.g., nitrogen) are always required to ensure the high loading content of SACs on the carbon support. However, the use of excess dopants is accompanied by formation of miscellaneous structures (particularly the uncoordinated N species) on catalysts, leading to adverse effects on their performance. Herein, the synthesis of carbon&#8208;supported Ni SACs with precisely controlled single&#8208;atom structure via joule heating strategy, showing the coordination of 80% of N dopants with metal elements, is reported. The preclusion of the unfavorable N species is confirmed to be the main reason for the superior performance of optimized Ni SACs in electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction, which demonstrates unprecedented activity, selectivity, and stability under an exceptionally broad voltage range (&gt;92% CO selectivity in the range of &#8722;0.7 to &#8722;1.9&#160;V reversible hydrogen electrode). Such a synthetic strategy is further applicable for the design of SACs with various metals. This work demonstrates a facile method for preclusion of unfavorable dopants in the SACs and its importance in catalytic application.

         <title>Skin&#8208;Integrated Devices with Soft, Holey Architectures for Wireless Physiological Monitoring, With Applications in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper introduces material strategies and design concepts including holey architectures, precurved layouts, and structured hydrogel adhesives, for thin, soft wireless devices that can continuously monitor vital signs in the neonatal and pediatric intensive care units. They enable the mechanical and geometrical advantages, soft release of devices from the skin, improved permeability, and visual inspection of the skin through holes.








Abstract
Continuous monitoring of vital signs is an essential aspect of operations in neonatal and pediatric intensive care units (NICUs and PICUs), of particular importance to extremely premature and/or critically ill patients. Current approaches require multiple sensors taped to the skin and connected via hard&#8208;wired interfaces to external data acquisition electronics. The adhesives can cause iatrogenic injuries to fragile, underdeveloped skin, and the wires can complicate even the most routine tasks in patient care. Here, materials strategies and design concepts are introduced that significantly improve these platforms through the use of optimized materials, open (i.e., &#8220;holey&#8221;) layouts and precurved designs. These schemes 1) reduce the stresses at the skin interface, 2) facilitate release of interfacial moisture from transepidermal water loss, 3) allow visual inspection of the skin for rashes or other forms of irritation, 4) enable triggered reduction of adhesion to reduce the probability for injuries that can result from device removal. A combination of systematic benchtop testing and computational modeling identifies the essential mechanisms and key considerations. Demonstrations on adult volunteers and on a neonate in an operating NICUs illustrate a broad range of capabilities in continuous, clinical&#8208;grade monitoring of conventional vital signs, and unconventional indicators of health status.

         <title>18.5% Efficiency Organic Solar Cells with a Hybrid Planar/Bulk Heterojunction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid planar/bulk heterojunction is constructed by introducing a p&#8208;type polymer (PTO3) and an n&#8208;type naphthalene imide (NDI&#8208;i8) on both sides of a mixed donor:acceptor active layer. The tailored hybrid heterojunction presents a decreased energy loss and improved efficiency. As a result, an outstanding PCE of 18.5% is achieved, which is among the top values in the field of organic solar cells.








Abstract
The donor:acceptor heterojunction has proved as the most successful approach to split strongly bound excitons in organic solar cells (OSCs). Establishing an ideal architecture with selective carrier transport and suppressed recombination is of great importance to improve the photovoltaic efficiency while remains a challenge. Herein, via tailoring a hybrid planar/bulk structure, highly efficient OSCs with reduced energy losses (Elosss) are fabricated. A p&#8208;type benzodithiophene&#8208;thiophene alternating polymer and an n&#8208;type naphthalene imide are inserted on both sides of a mixed donor:acceptor active layer to construct the hybrid heterojunction, respectively. The tailored structure with the donor near the anode and the acceptor near the cathode is beneficial for obtaining enhanced charge transport, extraction, and suppressed charge recombination. As a result, the photovoltaic characterizations suggest a reduced nonradiative Eloss by 25 meV, and the best OSC records a high efficiency of 18.5% (certified as 18.2%). This study highlights that precisely regulating the structure of donor:acceptor heterojunction has the potential to further improve the efficiencies of OSCs.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Catalysis: From Simple Reactions to the Synthesis of Complex Molecules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mimicking the homogeneous catalytic process for fine chemical production is the ultimate goal for single&#8208;atom catalysis (SAC) in view of their structural similarity. This review presents the recent progress of SAC on complex liquid&#8208;phase transformations and highlights the importance of chemoselectivity and structural dynamism for building up molecular complexity through late&#8208;stage functionalization, sequential, and multicomponent strategies.








Abstract
To date, the scope of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SAC) in liquid&#8208;phase transformations is rather limited owing to stability issues and the inability to activate complex substances. This calls for a better design of the catalyst support that can provide a dynamic coordination environment needed for catalytic action, and yet retain robustness against leaching or aggregation. In addition, the chemical orthogonality of SAC is useful for designing tandem or multicomponent reactions, in which side reactions common to metal nanoparticles are suppressed. In this review, the intrinsic mechanism will be highlighted that controls reaction efficiency and selectivity in SAC&#8208;catalyzed pathways, as well as the structural dynamism of SAC under complex liquid&#8208;phase conditions. These mechanistic insights are helpful for the development of next&#8208;generation SAC systems for the synthesis of high&#8208;value pharmaceuticals through late&#8208;stage functionalization, sequential and multicomponent strategies.

         <title>A Novel Immunomodulator Delivery Platform Based on Bacterial Biomimetic Vesicles for Enhanced Antitumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Immunomodulator interleukin 10 (IL10) exposed on the surface and tumor antigen E7 packaged in the periplasm (IL10&#8208;E7&#8208;bacterial biomimetic vesicles (BBVs)) are constructed using a bacterial biomimetic vesicles modification technique. After IL10&#8208;E7&#8208;BBV injection, E7 induces specific tumor immunity, while IL10 reduces CD8+ T cell exhaustion in lymph nodes. Therefore, multifunctional synergy is achieved in a drug design to enhance tumor immunity.








Abstract
T cell activation&#8208;induced cell death (AICD) during tumor pathogenesis is a tumor immune escape process dependent on dendritic cells (DCs). Proper immune&#8208;modulatory therapies effectively inhibit tumor&#8208;specific CD8+ T cell exhaustion and enhance antitumor immune responses. Here, high&#8208;pressure homogenization is utilized to drive immunomodulator IL10&#8208;modified bacteria to extrude through the gap and self&#8208;assemble into bacterial biomimetic vesicles exposing IL10 (IL10&#8208;BBVs) on the surface with high efficiency. IL10&#8208;BBVs efficiently target DCs in tumor&#8208;draining lymph nodes and thus increase the interaction between IL10 on BBVs and IL10R on DCs to suppress AICD and mitigate CD8+ T cell exhaustion specific to tumor antigens. Two subcutaneous peripheral injections of IL10&#8208;BBVs 1 week apart in tumor&#8208;bearing mice effectively increase systemic and intratumoral proportions of CD8+ T cells to suppress tumor growth and metastasis. Tumor&#8208;specific antigen E7 is enclosed into the periplasm of IL10&#8208;BBVs (IL10&#8208;E7&#8208;BBVs) to realize concurrent actions of the immunomodulator IL10 and the tumor antigen human papillomavirus (HPV) 16E7 in lymph nodes, further enhancing the antitumor effects mediated by CD8+ T cells. The development of this modified BBV delivery platform will expand the application of bacterial membranes and provide novel immunotherapeutic strategies for tumor treatment.

         <title>Controllable Solution&#8208;Phase Epitaxial Growth of Q1D Sb2(S,Se)3/CdS Heterojunction Solar Cell with 9.2% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solar cell device based on (hk1)&#8208;oriented Sb2(S,Se)S3 grown on top of hexagonal CdS is successfully prepared. The enhanced device performance is attributed not only to the faster charge transport along the vertically oriented (Sb4X6)n ribbons, but also to the efficient charge extraction across the heterojunction owing to the formation of favorable covalent bond at the junction.








Abstract
Antimony sulfoselenide (Sb2(S,Se)3) is a promising photoabsorber for stable and high efficiency thin film photovoltaics (PV). The unique quasi&#8208;1D (Q1D) crystal structure gives Sb2(S,Se)3 intriguing anisotropic optoelectronic properties, which intrinsically require the optimization of crystal growth orientation, especially for electronic devices with vertical charge transport such as solar cells. Although the efficiency of Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells has been improved greatly through optimizing the material quality, the fundamental issue of crystal orientation control in polycrystalline films remains unsolved, resulting in charge carrier recombination losses in the device. Herein, the epitaxial growth of vertically&#8208;oriented Sb2(S,Se)3 film on hexagonal CdS is successfully realized via a solution&#8208;based synergistic crystal growth process. The crystallographic orientation relationship between Sb2(S,Se)3 light absorber and the CdS substrate has been rigorously investigated. The best performing Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cell shows a high power conversion efficiency of 9.2% owing to the faster charge transport in the bulk and the efficient charge extraction across the heterojunction. This study points to a new direction to control the crystal growth of mixed&#8208;anion Sb2(S,Se)3, which is crucial to achieve high efficiency solar cells based on antimony chalcogenides with low dimensionality.

         <title>Anisotropic Nodal&#8208;Line&#8208;Derived Large Anomalous Hall Conductivity in ZrMnP and HfMnP</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anomalous Hall conductivity appears in metallic ferromagnets due to the anomalous velocity of charge carriers in the presence of a magnetic field. In ferromagnets ZrMnP and HfMnP, the abundance of mirror planes forming nodal lines at the Fermi energy guides and enhances such velocity, resulting both the compounds exhibiting large value of anomalous Hall conductivity.








Abstract
The nontrivial band structure of semimetals has attracted substantial research attention in condensed matter physics and materials science in recent years owing to its intriguing physical properties. Within this class, a group of nontrivial materials known as nodal&#8208;line semimetals is particularly important. Nodal&#8208;line semimetals exhibit the potential effects of electronic correlation in nonmagnetic materials, whereas they enhance the contribution of the Berry curvature in magnetic materials, resulting in high anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC). In this study, two ferromagnetic compounds, namely ZrMnP and HfMnP, are selected, wherein the abundance of mirror planes in the crystal structure ensures gapped nodal lines at the Fermi energy. These nodal lines result in one of the largest AHC values of 2840 &#937;&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1, with a high anomalous Hall angle of 13.6% in these compounds.

     alt="Anisotropic Nodal-Line-Derived Large Anomalous Hall Conductivity in ZrMnP and HfMnP"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anomalous Hall conductivity appears in metallic ferromagnets due to the anomalous velocity of charge carriers in the presence of a magnetic field. In ferromagnets ZrMnP and HfMnP, the abundance of mirror planes forming nodal lines at the Fermi energy guides and enhances such velocity, resulting both the compounds exhibiting large value of anomalous Hall conductivity.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nontrivial band structure of semimetals has attracted substantial research attention in condensed matter physics and materials science in recent years owing to its intriguing physical properties. Within this class, a group of nontrivial materials known as nodal-line semimetals is particularly important. Nodal-line semimetals exhibit the potential effects of electronic correlation in nonmagnetic materials, whereas they enhance the contribution of the Berry curvature in magnetic materials, resulting in high anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC). In this study, two ferromagnetic compounds, namely ZrMnP and HfMnP, are selected, wherein the abundance of mirror planes in the crystal structure ensures gapped nodal lines at the Fermi energy. These nodal lines result in one of the largest AHC values of 2840 &#937;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, with a high anomalous Hall angle of 13.6% in these compounds. First-principles calculations provide a clear and detailed understanding of nodal line-enhanced AHC. The finding suggests a guideline for searching large AHC compounds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Novel Ultrabright and Air&#8208;Stable Photocathodes Discovered from Machine Learning and Density Functional Theory Driven Screening</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Over 74 000 semiconducting materials are computationally screened to identify promising ultrahigh brightness photocathode materials for use in next&#8208;generation free&#8208;electron lasers. This broad search results in the identification of novel materials that are predicted to be considerably brighter and more resistant to oxidation than the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photocathode materials.








Abstract
The high brightness, low emittance electron beams achieved in modern X&#8208;ray free&#8208;electron lasers (XFELs) have enabled powerful X&#8208;ray imaging tools, allowing molecular systems to be imaged at picosecond time scales and sub&#8208;nanometer length scales. One of the most promising directions for increasing the brightness of XFELs is through the development of novel photocathode materials. Whereas past efforts aimed at discovering photocathode materials have typically employed trial&#8208;and&#8208;error&#8208;based iterative approaches, this work represents the first data&#8208;driven screening for high brightness photocathode materials. Through screening over 74 000 semiconducting materials, a vast photocathode dataset is generated, resulting in statistically meaningful insights into the nature of high brightness photocathode materials. This screening results in a diverse list of photocathode materials that exhibit intrinsic emittances that are up to 4x lower than currently used photocathodes. In a second effort, multiobjective screening is employed to identify the family of M2O (M = Na, K, Rb) that exhibits photoemission properties that are comparable to the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photocathode materials, but with superior air stability. This family represents perhaps the first intrinsically bright, visible light photocathode materials that are resistant to reactions with oxygen, allowing for their transport and storage in dry air environments.

         <title>Molecular Ferroelectric&#8208;Based Flexible Sensors Exhibiting Supersensitivity and Multimodal Capability for Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
[C(NH2)3]ClO4&#8208;polyurethane flexible sensors feature a series of unique characteristic including self&#8208;powering, high sensitivity, and excellent durability. A comprehensive scaling analysis along with computational modeling provides insights into the electro&#8208;mechanical coupling and establishes the rules of engineering design and optimization for the molecular ferroelectric&#8208;based flexible sensors.








Abstract
Although excellent dielectric, piezoelectric, and pyroelectric properties matched with or even surpassing those of ferroelectric ceramics have been recently discovered in molecular ferroelectrics, their successful applications in devices are scarce. The fracture proneness of molecular ferroelectrics under mechanical loading precludes their applications as flexible sensors in bulk crystalline form. Here, self&#8208;powered flexible mechanical sensors prepared from the facile deposition of molecular ferroelectric [C(NH2)3]ClO4 onto a porous polyurethane (PU) matrix are reported. [C(NH2)3]ClO4&#8208;PU is capable of detecting pressure of 3&#160;Pa and strain of 1% that are hardly accessible by the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art piezoelectric, triboelectric, and piezoresistive sensors, and presents the ability of sensing multimodal mechanical forces including compression, stretching, bending, shearing, and twisting with high cyclic stability. This scaling analysis corroborated with computational modeling provides detailed insights into the electro&#8208;mechanical coupling and establishes rules of engineering design and optimization for the hybrid sponges. Demonstrative applications of the [C(NH2)3]ClO4&#8208;PU array suggest potential uses in interactive electronics and robotic systems.

         <title>Mito&#8208;Bomb: Targeting Mitochondria for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the concept of &#8220;Mito&#8208;Bomb Tumor Therapy&#8221; is proposed from an interdisciplinary perspective of &#8220;biology&#8208;chemistry&#8208;materials,&#8221; and the biological functions of mitochondria, mitochondria&#8208;targeting functional units, and various cancer treatment strategies that target mitochondria, including but not limited to photothermal therapy, photodynamic therapy, and chemodynamic therapy are summarized in detail.








Abstract
Cancer has been one of the most common life&#8208;threatening diseases for a long time. Traditional cancer therapies such as surgery, chemotherapy (CT), and radiotherapy (RT) have limited effects due to drug resistance, unsatisfactory treatment efficiency, and side effects. In recent years, photodynamic therapy (PDT), photothermal therapy (PTT), and chemodynamic therapy (CDT) have been utilized for cancer treatment owing to their high selectivity, minor resistance, and minimal toxicity. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that selective delivery of drugs to specific subcellular organelles can significantly enhance the efficiency of cancer therapy. Mitochondria&#8208;targeting therapeutic strategies are promising for cancer therapy, which is attributed to the essential role of mitochondria in the regulation of cancer cell apoptosis, metabolism, and more vulnerable to hyperthermia and oxidative damage. Herein, the rational design, functionalization, and applications of diverse mitochondria&#8208;targeting units, involving organic phosphine/sulfur salts, quaternary ammonium (QA) salts, peptides, transition&#8208;metal complexes, guanidinium or bisguanidinium, as well as mitochondria&#8208;targeting cancer therapies including PDT, PTT, CDT, and others are summarized. This review aims to furnish researchers with deep insights and hints in the design and applications of novel mitochondria&#8208;targeting agents for cancer therapy.

         <title>Plasmonic Nanoparticle Lattice Devices for White&#8208;Light Lasing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A plasmonic nanolaser architecture based on sandwiched aluminum nanoparticle lattices can produce white&#8208;light lasing. The two nanoparticle lattices with appropriately designed periodicities support three different surface lattice resonances as cavity modes at blue, green, and red wavelengths. A liquid gain layer consisting of three different dyes can facilitate simultaneous blue, green, and red lasing with a white&#8208;light emission profile.








Abstract
A plasmonic nanolaser architecture that can produce white&#8208;light emission is reported. A laser device is designed based on a mixed dye solution used as gain material sandwiched between two aluminum nanoparticle (NP) square lattices of different periodicities. The (&#177;1, 0) and (&#177;1, &#177;1)&#160;band&#8208;edge surface lattice resonance (SLR) modes of one NP lattice and the (&#177;1, 0) band&#8208;edge mode of the other NP lattice function as nanocavity modes for red, blue, and green lasing respectively. From a single aluminum NP lattice, simultaneous red and blue lasing is realized from a binary dye solution, and the relative intensities of the two colors are controlled by the volume ratio of the dyes. Also, a laser device is constructed by sandwiching dye solutions between two Al NP lattices with different periodicities, which enables red&#8211;green and blue&#8211;green lasing. With a combination of three dyes as liquid gain, red, green, and blue lasing for a white&#8208;light emission profile is realized.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid amyloid&#8208;like protein nanofilm with high mechanical strength and robust interfacial adhesion shows high interfacial activity to induce electroless deposition of metal on a flexible substrate, and significantly diminishes the development of microcracks after repetitive bending or stretching of metal&#8208;coated polymer substrates. This work demonstrates the significant contribution of amyloid&#8208;like protein aggregation in the fabrication of flexible conductive devices.








Abstract
A fatal weakness in flexible electronics is the mechanical fracture that occurs during repetitive fatigue deformation; thus, controlling the crack development of the conductive layer is of prime importance and has remained a great challenge until now. Herein, this issue is tackled by utilizing an amyloid/polysaccharide molecular composite as an interfacial binder. Sodium alginate (SA) can take part in amyloid&#8208;like aggregation of the lysozyme, leading to the facile synthesis of a 2D protein/saccharide hybrid nanofilm over an ultralarge area (e.g., &gt;400&#160;cm2). The introduction of SA into amyloid&#8208;like aggregates significantly enhances the mechanical strength of the hybrid nanofilm, which, with the help of amyloid&#8208;mediated interfacial adhesion, effectively diminishes the microcracks in the hybrid nanofilm coating after repetitive bending or stretching. The microcrack&#8208;free hybrid nanofilm then shows high interfacial activity to induce electroless deposition of metal in a Kelvin model on a substrate, which noticeably suppresses the formation of microcracks and consequent conductivity loss during the bending and stretching of the metal&#8208;coated flexible substrates. This work underlines the significance of amyloid/polysaccharide nanocomposites in the design of interfacial binders for reliable flexible electronic devices and represents an important contribution to mimicking amyloid and polysaccharide&#8208;based adhesive cements created by organisms.

         <title>Doping Process of 2D Materials Based on the Selective Migration of Dopants to the Interface of Liquid Metals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interface of liquid metals is used as natural filtering for doping and harvesting 2D doped metal oxide semiconductors. 2D Bi2O3&#8208;doped SnO semiconducting sheets are produced based on the different migration tendencies of Sn and Bi metals within the bulk competing for the selective enrichment of the liquid metal interface.








Abstract
The introduction of trace impurities within the doping processes of semiconductors is still a technological challenge for the electronics industries. By taking advantage of the selective enrichment of liquid metal interfaces, and harvesting the doped metal oxide semiconductor layers, the complexity of the process can be mitigated and a high degree of control over the outcomes can be achieved. Here, a mechanism of natural filtering for the preparation of doped 2D semiconducting sheets based on the different migration tendencies of metallic elements in the bulk competing for enriching the interfaces is proposed. As a model, liquid metal alloys with different weight ratios of Sn and Bi in the bulk are employed for harvesting Bi2O3&#8208;doped SnO nanosheets. In this model, Sn shows a much stronger tendency than Bi to occupy surface sites of the Bi&#8211;Sn alloys, even at the very high concentrations of Bi in the bulk. This provides the opportunity for creating SnO 2D sheets with tightly controlled Bi2O3 dopants. By way of example, it is demonstrated how such nanosheets could be made selective to both reducing and oxidizing environmental gases. The process demonstrated here offers significant opportunities for future synthesis and fabrication processes in the electronics industries.

         <title>Nanocomplex&#8208;Mediated In Vivo Programming to Chimeric Antigen Receptor&#8208;M1 Macrophages for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)&#8208;T cell therapy is costly and challenged for solid tumor treatment. Here, an approach is presented to&#160;in vivo&#160;programming of&#160;macrophages into CAR&#8208;M1 macrophages to overcome the challenges. In vivo&#160;injection of nanocomplexes of macrophage&#8208;targeting nanocarrier and CAR&#8208;M1 macrophage&#8208;inducing DNA generate CAR&#8208;M1 macrophages that facilitate CAR&#8208;mediated cancer phagocytosis, anti&#8208;tumor immunomodulation, and inhibition of solid tumor growth.








Abstract
Chimeric antigen receptor&#8208;T (CAR&#8208;T) cell immunotherapy has shown impressive clinical outcomes for hematologic malignancies. However, its broader applications are challenged due to its complex ex vivo cell&#8208;manufacturing procedures and low therapeutic efficacy against solid tumors. The limited therapeutic effects are partially due to limited CAR&#8208;T cell infiltration to solid tumors and inactivation of CAR&#8208;T cells by the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Here, a facile approach is presented to in vivo program macrophages, which can intrinsically penetrate solid tumors, into CAR&#8208;M1 macrophages displaying enhanced cancer&#8208;directed phagocytosis and anti&#8208;tumor activity. In vivo injected nanocomplexes of macrophage&#8208;targeting nanocarriers and CAR&#8208;interferon&#8208;&#947;&#8208;encoding plasmid DNA induce CAR&#8208;M1 macrophages that are capable of CAR&#8208;mediated cancer phagocytosis, anti&#8208;tumor immunomodulation, and inhibition of solid tumor growth. Together, this study describes an off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf CAR&#8208;macrophage therapy that is effective for solid tumors and avoids the complex and costly processes of ex vivo CAR&#8208;cell manufacturing.

         <title>Abnormally High&#8208;Lithium Storage in Pure Crystalline C60 Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Researches on highly reversible lithium storage behavior in crystalline C60 nanoparticles as anode material of lithium&#8208;ion batteries are demonstrated systematically for the first time. The involved new phase generation and transformation of LixC60 during lithiation/de&#8208;lithiation process are monitored unprecedently and proved through the advanced in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction, high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy, and first&#8208;principles calculations.








Abstract
Li+ intercalates into a pure face&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (fcc) C60 structure instead of being adsorbed on a single C60 molecule. This hinders the excess storage of Li ions in Li&#8208;ion batteries, thereby limiting their applications. However, the associated electrochemical processes and mechanisms have not been investigated owing to the low electrochemical reactivity and poor crystallinity of the C60 powder. Herein, a facile method for synthesizing pure fcc C60 nanoparticles with uniform morphology and superior electrochemical performance in both half&#8208; and full&#8208;cells is demonstrated using a 1 m LiPF6 solution in ethylene carbonate/diethyl carbonate (1:1 vol%) with 10% fluoroethylene carbonate. The specific capacity of the C60 nanoparticles during the second discharge reaches &#8776;750 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1, approximately twice that of graphite. Moreover, by applying in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction, high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy, and first&#8208;principles calculations, an abnormally high Li storage in a crystalline C60 structure is proposed based on the vacant sites among the C60 molecules, Li clusters at different sites, and structural changes during the discharge/charge process. The fcc of C60 transforms tetragonal via orthorhombic LixC60 and back to the cubic phase during discharge. The presented results will facilitate the development of novel fullerene&#8208;based anode materials for Li&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Reporting Excellent Transverse Piezoelectric and Electro&#8208;Optic Effects in Transparent Rhombohedral PMN&#8208;PT Single Crystal by Engineered Domains</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perfect transparency is achieved along the [110] and [001] directions in [110]&#8208;poled rhombohedral PMN&#8208;PT crystals, which have a high d31 value of 1700 pC N&#8722;1 and a high electro&#8208;optic coefficient &#947;33 of 320 pm V&#8722;1. This implies that the [110]&#8208;oriented rhombohedral PMN&#8208;PT crystal can realize the mode of transverse modulation.








Abstract
Transparent ferroelectric crystals with high piezoelectricity are challenging to build because of their complex structure and disordered domains in rhombohedral relaxor ferroelectrics. There are eight domains along the &lt;111&gt; direction, which cause light scattering. In this study, perfect transparency is achieved along the [110] and [001] directions in [110]&#8208;poled rhombohedral 0.72Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3&#8208;0.28PbTiO3 (PMN&#8208;PT) crystals, which have a high d31 value of 1700 pC N&#8722;1 and a high electro&#8208;optic coefficient &#947;33 of 320 pm V&#8722;1. This implies that the [110]&#8208;oriented rhombohedral PMN&#8208;0.28PT crystal can realize the mode of transverse modulation, whereas the [001]&#8208;oriented PMN&#8208;0.28PT crystal is more suitable for the longitudinal mode. Through piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM), it is confirmed that the [110]&#8208;poled rhombohedral PMN&#8208;PT crystals form 71&#176; layered domains, which are similar to the 109&#176; layered domains of the [001]&#8208;oriented transparent crystal. Combined with PFM and birefringence microscopy, the degradation of domains and thickness dependence of piezoelectricity provide clear evidence for the relationship between the engineered domain structures and piezoelectric properties, which should be considered in the design of piezoelectric or electro&#8208;optic devices with excellent performance. This work enriches the research on ferroelectric domain engineering for excellent transparency and high piezoelectricity to provide new ideas for photoacoustic devices.

&lt;p&gt;Perfect transparency is achieved along the [110] and [001] directions in [110]-poled rhombohedral PMN-PT crystals, which have a high &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;31&lt;/sub&gt; value of 1700 pC N&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a high electro-optic coefficient &#947;&lt;sub&gt;33&lt;/sub&gt; of 320 pm V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This implies that the [110]-oriented rhombohedral PMN-PT crystal can realize the mode of transverse modulation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transparent ferroelectric crystals with high piezoelectricity are challenging to build because of their complex structure and disordered domains in rhombohedral relaxor ferroelectrics. There are eight domains along the &amp;lt;111&amp;gt; direction, which cause light scattering. In this study, perfect transparency is achieved along the [110] and [001] directions in [110]-poled rhombohedral 0.72Pb(Mg&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;Nb&lt;sub&gt;2/3&lt;/sub&gt;)O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-0.28PbTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (PMN-PT) crystals, which have a high &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;31&lt;/sub&gt; value of 1700 pC N&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a high electro-optic coefficient &#947;&lt;sub&gt;33&lt;/sub&gt; of 320 pm V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This implies that the [110]-oriented rhombohedral PMN-0.28PT crystal can realize the mode of transverse modulation, whereas the [001]-oriented PMN-0.28PT crystal is more suitable for the longitudinal mode.

         <title>Wafer&#8208;Scale 2D Hafnium Diselenide Based Memristor Crossbar Array for Energy&#8208;Efficient Neural Network Hardware</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D hafnium diselenide (HfSe2) memristor crossbar array (CBA) is demonstrated via wafer&#8208;scale molecular beam epitaxy growth and metal&#8208;assisted van der Waals transfer techniques. The CBA enables artificial neural network with high recognition accuracy of 93.34%, and achieves hardware convolution image processing using energy&#8208;efficient multiply&#8208;and accumulate operations.








Abstract
Memristor crossbar with programmable conductance could overcome the energy consumption and speed limitations of neural networks when executing core computing tasks in image processing. However, the implementation of crossbar array (CBA) based on ultrathin 2D materials is hindered by challenges associated with large&#8208;scale material synthesis and device integration. Here, a memristor CBA is demonstrated using wafer&#8208;scale (2&#8208;inch) polycrystalline hafnium diselenide (HfSe2) grown by molecular beam epitaxy, and a metal&#8208;assisted van der Waals transfer technique. The memristor exhibits small switching voltage (0.6&#160;V), low switching energy (0.82 pJ), and simultaneously achieves emulation of synaptic weight plasticity. Furthermore, the CBA enables artificial neural network with a high recognition accuracy of 93.34%. Hardware multiply&#8208;and&#8208;accumulate (MAC) operation with a narrow error distribution of 0.29% is also demonstrated, and a high power efficiency of greater than 8&#8208;trillion operations per second per Watt is achieved. Based on the MAC results, hardware convolution image processing can be performed using programmable kernels (i.e., soft, horizontal, and vertical edge enhancement), which constitutes a vital function for neural network hardware.

         <title>Signal Filtering Enabled by Spike Voltage&#8208;Dependent Plasticity in Metalloporphyrin&#8208;Based Memristors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel memristor based on metalloporphyrin/oxide hybrid heterojunction is developed, in which the metalloporphyrin&#8208;based intelligent semiconductors allow for dual electronic/ionic transport. The memristive devices exhibit unipolar plasticity, which can qualify the signal filtering function of the human visual system by programming different positive voltage spikes at fixed frequencies and time intervals.








Abstract
Neural systems can selectively filter and memorize spatiotemporal information, thus enabling high&#8208;efficient information processing. Emulating such an exquisite biological process in electronic devices is of fundamental importance for developing neuromorphic architectures with efficient in situ edge/parallel computing, and probabilistic inference. Here a novel multifunctional memristor is proposed and demonstrated based on metalloporphyrin/oxide hybrid heterojunction, in which the metalloporphyrin layer allows for dual electronic/ionic transport. Benefiting from the coordination&#8208;assisted ionic diffusion, the device exhibits smooth, gradual conductive transitions. It is shown that the memristive characteristics of this hybrid system can be modulated by altering the metal center for desired metal&#8211;oxygen bonding energy and oxygen ions migration dynamics. The spike voltage&#8208;dependent plasticity stemming from the local/extended movement of oxygen ions under low/high voltage is identified, which permits potentiation and depression under unipolar different positive voltages. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, memristive arrays are further built to emulate the signal filtering function of the biological visual system. This work demonstrates the ionic intelligence feature of metalloporphyrin and paves the way for implementing efficient neural&#8208;signal analysis in neuromorphic hardware.

         <title>A Bioinspired Stretchable Sensory&#8208;Neuromorphic System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a novel form of stretchable integrated system, namely a bioinspired stretchable sensory&#8208;neuromorphic system is presented, which comprises an artificial mechanoreceptor, an artificial synapse, and an epidermal photonic actuator as three devices. This system features the bioinspired sensory&#8208;neuromorphic system entailing tactile sensing, pattern learning/inferencing, and visualizing feedback information.








Abstract
Conventional stretchable electronics that adopt a wavy design, a neutral mechanical plane, and conformal contact between abiotic and biotic interfaces have exhibited diverse skin&#8208;interfaced applications. Despite such remarkable progress, the evolution of intelligent skin prosthetics is challenged by the absence of the monolithic integration of neuromorphic constituents into individual sensing and actuating components. Herein, a bioinspired stretchable sensory&#8208;neuromorphic system, comprising an artificial mechanoreceptor, artificial synapse, and epidermal photonic actuator is demonstrated; these three biomimetic functionalities correspond to a stretchable capacitive pressure sensor, a resistive random&#8208;access memory, and a quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diode, respectively. This system features a rigid&#8208;island structure interconnected with a sinter&#8208;free printable conductor, which is optimized by controlling the evaporation rate of solvent (&#8776;160% stretchability and &#8776;18&#160;550 S cm&#8722;1 conductivity). Devised design improves both areal density and structural reliability while avoiding the thermal degradation of heat&#8208;sensitive stretchable electronic components. Moreover, even in the skin deformation range, the system accurately recognizes various patterned stimuli via an artificial neural network with training/inferencing functions. Therefore, the new bioinspired system is expected to be an important step toward implementing intelligent wearable electronics.

         <title>A Liquid Metal Artificial Muscle</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A liquid metal artificial muscle (LMAM) based on the electrochemically tunable interfacial tension of EGaIn liquid metal is demonstrated to mimic the contraction and extension of muscles. The actuating components of the LMAM are completely built from liquids, which avoids mechanical fatigue and provides actuator linkages without mechanical constraints to movement. Various proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept applications are demonstrated using the LMAM.








Abstract
Artificial muscles possess a vast potential in accelerating the development of robotics, exoskeletons, and prosthetics. Although a variety of emerging actuator technologies are reported, they suffer from several issues, such as high driving voltages, large hysteresis, and water intolerance. Here, a liquid metal artificial muscle (LMAM) is demonstrated, based on the electrochemically tunable interfacial tension of liquid metal to mimic the contraction and extension of muscles. The LMAM can work in different solutions with a wide range of pH (0&#8211;14), generating actuation strains of up to 87% at a maximum extension speed of 15 mm s&#8722;1. More importantly, the LMAM only needs a very low driving voltage of 0.5 V. The actuating components of the LMAM are completely built from liquids, which avoids mechanical fatigue and provides actuator linkages without mechanical constraints to movement. The LMAM is used for developing several proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept applications, including controlled displays, cargo deliveries, and reconfigurable optical reflectors. The simplicity, versatility, and efficiency of the LMAM are further demonstrated by using it to actuate the caudal fin of an untethered bionic robotic fish. The presented LMAM has the potential to extend the performance space of soft actuators for applications from engineering fields to biomedical applications.

         <title>Liquid Metal Composites with Enhanced Thermal Conductivity and Stability Using Molecular Thermal Linker</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid metal composite with metallic fillers is a promising class of thermal interface materials. In this work, 3&#8208;chloropropyltriethoxysilane is used to serve as molecular thermal linkers and diffusion barriers at the liquid metal&#8208;copper interface. Enhancement in both thermal conductivity and stability of liquid metal&#8208;copper composite is achieved using this interfacial engineering approach.








Abstract
Gallium&#8208;based liquid metal (LM) composite with metallic fillers is an emerging class of thermal interface materials (TIMs), which are widely applied in electronics and power systems to improve their performance. In situ alloying between gallium and many metallic fillers like copper and silver, however, leads to a deteriorated composite stability. This paper presents an interfacial engineering approach using 3&#8208;chloropropyltriethoxysilane (CPTES) to serve as effective thermal linkers and diffusion barriers at the copper&#8208;gallium oxide interfaces in the LM matrix, achieving an enhancement in both thermal conductivity and stability of the composite. By mixing LM with copper particles modified by CPTES, a thermal conductivity (&#954;) as high as 65.9 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 is achieved. In addition, &#954;&#160;can be tuned by altering the terminal groups of silane molecules, demonstrating the flexibility of this approach. The potential use of such composite as a TIM is also shown in the heat dissipation of a computer central processing unit. While most studies on LM&#8208;based composites enhance the material performance via direct mixing of various fillers, this work provides a different approach to fabricate high&#8208;performance LM&#8208;based composites and may further advance their applications in various areas including thermal management systems, flexible electronics, consumer electronics, and biomedical systems.

         <title>Photoresponsive and Polarization&#8208;Sensitive Structural Colors from Cellulose/Liquid Crystal Nanophotonic Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polarization&#8208;sensitive and photoresponsive nanophotonic system based on structural colors that are generated by cellulose nanocrystal films and modulated by a birefringent liquid crystal coating is presented. Intense structural colors are appealingly varied by altering the handedness of the illuminating circularly polarized light. The system is further made photoresponsive using a UV&#8208;light&#8208;sensitive liquid crystal mixture.








Abstract
Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) possess the ability to form helical periodic structures that generate structural colors. Due to the helicity, such self&#8208;assembled cellulose structures preferentially reflect left&#8208;handed circularly polarized light of certain colors, while they remain transparent to right&#8208;handed circularly polarized light. This study shows that combination with a liquid crystal enables modulation of the optical response to obtain light reflection of both handedness but with reversed spectral profiles. As a result, the nanophotonic systems provide vibrant structural colors that are tunable via the incident light polarization. The results are attributed to the liquid crystal aligning on the CNC/glucose film, to form a birefringent layer that twists the incident light polarization before interaction with the chiral cellulose nanocomposite. Using a photoresponsive liquid crystal, this effect can further be turned off by exposure to UV light, which switches the nematic liquid crystal into a nonbirefringent isotropic phase. The study highlights the potential of hybrid cellulose systems to create self&#8208;assembled yet advanced photoresponsive and polarization&#8208;tunable nanophotonics.

         <title>Chiral Phonons and Giant Magneto&#8208;Optical Effect in CrBr3 2D Magnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phonon chirality and magneto&#8208;optical phenomena in CrBr3 2D magnet are reported. The superposition of doubly degenerate Eg modes results in chiral phonons with PAM of l&#160;=&#160;&#177;1, exhibiting isotropic linearly polarized Raman scattering. The non&#8208;degenerate Ag modes display a giant magneto&#8208;optical effect under an external out&#8208;of&#8208;plane magnetic field, rotating the plane of polarization of the scattered linearly polarized light.








Abstract
Phonons with chirality determine the optical helicity of inelastic light scattering processes due to their nonzero angular momentum. Here it is shown that 2D magnetic CrBr3 hosts chiral phonons at the Brillouin&#8208;zone center. These chiral phonons are linear combinations of the doubly&#8208;degenerate Eg phonons, and the phonon eigenmodes exhibit clockwise and counterclockwise rotational vibrations corresponding to angular momenta of l = &#177; 1.&#160;Such Eg chiral phonons completely switch the polarization of incident circularly polarized light. On the other hand, the non&#8208;degenerate non&#8208;chiral Ag phonons display a giant magneto&#8208;optical effect under an external out&#8208;of&#8208;plane magnetic field, rotating the plane of polarization of the scattered linearly polarized light. The corresponding degree of polarization of the scattered light changes from 91% to &#8722;68% as the magnetic field strength increases from 0 to 5 T. In contrast, the chiral Eg modes display no field dependence. The results lay a foundation for the study of phonon chirality and magneto&#8208;optical phenomena in 2D magnetic materials, as well as their related applications, such as the phonon Hall effect, topological photonics, and Raman lasing.

         <title>Machine Learning to Predict Quasicrystals from Chemical Compositions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quasicrystals are long&#8208;range ordered materials that exhibit rotational symmetries disallowed for periodic crystals. Since the first discovery of a quasicrystal in 1984, 100 or so thermodynamically stable quasicrystals have been found, but the pace of the discovery has been slowing down significantly in recent years. Machine&#8208;learning technologies open up the door to the accelerated discovery of new quasicrystals.








Abstract
Quasicrystals have emerged as the third class of solid&#8208;state materials, distinguished from periodic crystals and amorphous solids, which have long&#8208;range order without periodicity exhibiting rotational symmetries that are disallowed for periodic crystals in most cases. To date, more than one hundred stable quasicrystals have been reported, leading to the discovery of many new and exciting phenomena. However, the pace of the discovery of new quasicrystals has lowered in recent years, largely owing to the lack of clear guiding principles for the synthesis of new quasicrystals. Here, it is shown that the discovery of new quasicrystals can be accelerated with a simple machine&#8208;learning workflow. With a list of the chemical compositions of known stable quasicrystals, approximant crystals, and ordinary crystals, a prediction model is trained to solve the three&#8208;class classification task and its predictability compared to the observed phase diagrams of ternary aluminum systems is evaluated. The validation experiments strongly support the superior predictive power of machine learning, with the overall prediction accuracy of the phase prediction task reaching &#8776;0.728. Furthermore, analyzing the input&#8211;output relationships black&#8208;boxed into the model, nontrivial empirical equations interpretable by humans that describe conditions necessary for stable quasicrystal formation are&#160;identified.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Independent Photocleavage of Radical Nanogenerator for Near&#8208;IR&#8208;Gated and H2O&#8208;Mediated Free&#8208;Radical Nanotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interesting paradigm of oxygen&#8208;irrelevant photoactivated chemotherapy (PACT) via near&#8208;IR&#8208;gated and H2O&#8208;mediated photocleavage based on engineered yolk&#8211;shell upconversion of mesoporous silica nanoparticle nanomedicines to augment the therapeutic efficacy of PACT nanoagents for cancer treatment is reported.








Abstract
The oxygen&#8208;dependent nature and limited penetration capacity of visible light render the low efficiency of photodynamic therapy in hypoxic and deep&#8208;seated tumors. Therefore, the development of oxygen&#8208;free photoactivated chemotherapy (PACT) to generate cytotoxic reactive oxygen species by near&#8208;IR (NIR) light&#8208;cleavable photocages is in high demand. Here, an oxygen&#8208;irrelevant PACT strategy based on NIR light&#8208;triggered hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH) generation is developed for free&#8208;radical nanotherapy. Blebbistatin&#8208;loaded upconversion of mesoporous silica nanoparticles (UCSNs&#8208;B) is established to facilitate the high loading efficiency of blebbistatin and implement the efficient transformation of NIR light into blue light for unprecedented direct photorelease of oxygen&#8208;independent &#8226;OH. Under NIR laser irradiation, UCSNs&#8208;B converted NIR light into blue light, thus enabling the photocleavage of blebbistatin to induce the burst of &#8226;OH. The &#8226;OH burst under NIR laser irradiation further induces cancer cell apoptosis and significant suppression of hypoxic tumors. In addition, the gadolinium ion (Gd3+)&#8208;doped UCSNs&#8208;B are used as contrast agents in magnetic resonance imaging to facilitate real&#8208;time monitoring of the therapeutic processes. This study effectively demonstrates that the UCSNs&#8208;B act as NIR light&#8208;triggered photocages to facilitate oxygen&#8208;irrelevant &#8226;OH bursts, thus providing insights into the development of efficient PACT nanoagents for cancer treatment.

     alt="Oxygen-Independent Photocleavage of Radical Nanogenerator for Near-IR-Gated and H2O-Mediated Free-Radical Nanotherapy"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting paradigm of oxygen-irrelevant photoactivated chemotherapy (PACT) via near-IR-gated and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O-mediated photocleavage based on engineered yolk&#8211;shell upconversion of mesoporous silica nanoparticle nanomedicines to augment the therapeutic efficacy of PACT nanoagents for cancer treatment is reported.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oxygen-dependent nature and limited penetration capacity of visible light render the low efficiency of photodynamic therapy in hypoxic and deep-seated tumors. Therefore, the development of oxygen-free photoactivated chemotherapy (PACT) to generate cytotoxic reactive oxygen species by near-IR (NIR) light-cleavable photocages is in high demand. Here, an oxygen-irrelevant PACT strategy based on NIR light-triggered hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH) generation is developed for free-radical nanotherapy. Blebbistatin-loaded upconversion of mesoporous silica nanoparticles (UCSNs-B) is established to facilitate the high loading efficiency of blebbistatin and implement the efficient transformation of NIR light into blue light for unprecedented direct photorelease of oxygen-independent &#8226;OH. Under NIR laser irradiation, UCSNs-B converted NIR light into blue light, thus enabling the photocleavage of blebbistatin to induce the burst of &#8226;OH. The &#8226;OH burst under NIR laser irradiation further induces cancer cell apoptosis and significant suppression of hypoxic tumors. In addition, the gadolinium ion (Gd&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;)-doped UCSNs-B are used as contrast agents in magnetic resonance imaging to facilitate real-time monitoring of the therapeutic processes. This study effectively demonstrates that the UCSNs-B act as NIR light-triggered photocages to facilitate oxygen-irrelevant &#8226;OH bursts, thus providing insights into the development of efficient PACT nanoagents for cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Controlling Surface Wettability for Automated In Situ Array Synthesis and Direct Bioscreening</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amphiphilic coating for glass surfaces is reported, on which small droplets of polar aprotic organic solvents can be deposited with enhanced contact angle (small feature size) and inhibited motion (strong binding), permitting fully automated multiple rounds of combinatorial synthesis of small&#8208;molecule compounds and peptides. The amphiphilic coating can be switched to hydrophilic network for protein&#8208; and cell&#8208;based screening.








Abstract
The in situ synthesis of biomolecules on glass surfaces for direct bioscreening can be a powerful tool in the fields of pharmaceutical sciences, biomaterials, and chemical biology. However, it is still challenging to 1) achieve this conventional multistep combinatorial synthesis on glass surfaces with small feature sizes and high yields and 2) develop a surface which is compatible with solid&#8208;phase syntheses, as well as the subsequent bioscreening. This work reports an amphiphilic coating of a glass surface on which small droplets of polar aprotic organic solvents can be deposited with an enhanced contact angle and inhibited motion to permit fully automated multiple rounds of the combinatorial synthesis of small&#8208;molecule compounds and peptides. This amphiphilic coating can be switched into a hydrophilic network for protein&#8208; and cell&#8208;based screening. Employing this in situ synthesis method, chemical space can be probed via array technology with unprecedented speed for various applications, such as lead discovery/optimization in medicinal chemistry and biomaterial development.

         <title>Production of Multiple Cell&#8208;Laden Microtissue Spheroids with a Biomimetic Hepatic&#8208;Lobule&#8208;Like Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A technique for producing multicellular microtissue spheroids using bioprinting and a microfluidic emulsification system is presented. Spheroids with the biomimetic structure of liver lobules are produced with high throughput and uniform size. The spheroids with biomimetic structure show enhanced functionalities and stable structural integrity. In addition, the in vivo study reveals enhanced engraftment potential of the structured spheroids.








Abstract
The construction of an in vitro 3D cellular model to mimic the human liver is highly desired for drug discovery and clinical applications, such as patient&#8208;specific treatment and cell&#8208;based therapy in regenerative medicine. However, current bioprinting strategies are limited in their ability to generate multiple cell&#8208;laden microtissues with biomimetic structures. This study presents a method for producing hepatic&#8208;lobule&#8208;like microtissue spheroids using a bioprinting system incorporating a precursor cartridge and microfluidic emulsification system. The multiple cell&#8208;laden microtissue spheroids can be successfully generated at a speed of approximately 45 spheroids min&#8722;1 and with a uniform diameter. Hepatic and endothelial cells are patterned in a microtissue spheroid with the biomimetic structure of a liver lobule. The spheroids allow long&#8208;term culture with high cell viability, and the structural integrity is maintained longer than that of non&#8208;structured spheroids. Furthermore, structured spheroids show high MRP2, albumin, and CD31 expression levels. In addition, the in vivo study reveals that structured microtissue spheroids are stably engrafted. These results demonstrate that the method provides a valuable 3D structured microtissue spheroid model with lobule&#8208;like constructs and liver functions.

         <title>Electric Field Control of the Magnetic Weyl Fermion in an Epitaxial SrRuO3 (111) Thin Film</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electric field control of the magnetic Weyl fermion is achieved in an epitaxial SrRuO3 (111) film, the topological property of which is identified with the help of magnetotransport measurements, angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), and first&#8208;principles calculations.








Abstract
The magnetic Weyl fermion originates from the time reversal symmetry (TRS)&#8208;breaking in magnetic crystalline structures, where the topology and magnetism entangle with each other. Therefore, the magnetic Weyl fermion is expected to be effectively tuned by the magnetic field and electrical field, which holds promise for future topologically protected electronics. However, the electrical field control of the magnetic Weyl fermion has rarely been reported, which is prevented by the limited number of identified magnetic Weyl solids. Here, the electric field control of the magnetic Weyl fermion is demonstrated in an epitaxial SrRuO3 (111) thin film. The magnetic Weyl fermion in the SrRuO3 films is indicated by the chiral anomaly induced magnetotransport, and is verified by the observed Weyl nodes in the electronic structures characterized by the angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and first&#8208;principles calculations. Through the ionic&#8208;liquid gating experiment, the effective manipulation of the Weyl fermion by electric field is demonstrated, in terms of the sign&#8208;change of the ordinary Hall effect, the nonmonotonic tuning of the anomalous Hall effect, and the observation of the linear magnetoresistance under proper gating voltages. The work may stimulate the searching and tuning of Weyl fermions in other magnetic materials, which are promising in energy&#8208;efficient electronics.

         <title>A Universal Compensation Strategy to Anchor Polar Organic Molecules in Bilayered Hydrated Vanadates for Promoting Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal compensation strategy is reported to introduce polar organic molecules into the interlayer of AlxV2O5&#183;nH2O by replacing partial crystal water. Owing to the high&#8208;polar carbonyl/sulfenyl and low&#8208;polar alkyl, the organic molecules display a strong interaction with pre&#8208;intercalated Al3+ and a weak interaction with Zn2+. Consequently, the cathode displays superior structural stability and ion transfer kinetics, leading to excellent performance.








Abstract
The electrochemical performance of layered vanadium oxides is often improved by introducing guest species into their interlayer. Guest species with high stability in the interlayer and weak interaction with Zn2+ during charge/discharge process are desired to promoting reversible Zn2+ transfer. Herein, a universal compensation strategy was&#160;developed to introduce various polar organic molecules into the interlayer of AlxV2O5&#183;nH2O by replacing partial crystal water. The high&#8208;polar groups in the organic molecules have a strong electrostatic attraction with pre&#8208;intercalated Al3+, which ensures that organic molecules can be anchored in the interlayer of hydrated vanadates. Simultaneously, the low&#8208;polar groups endow organic molecules with a weak interaction with Zn2+ during cycling, thus liberalizing reversible Zn2+ transfer. As a result, AlxV2O5 with polar organic molecules displays enhanced electrochemical performance. Furthermore, based on above cathode material, a pouch cell was&#160;assembled by further integrating a dendrite&#8208;free N&#8208;doped carbon nanofiber@Zn anode, displaying an energy density of 50&#160;Wh kg&#8208;1. This work provides a path for designing stable guest species with a weak interaction with Zn2+ in the interlayer of layered vanadium oxide towards high&#8208;performance cathode materials of aqueous Zn batteries.

The high-polar groups in the organic molecules have a strong electrostatic attraction with pre-intercalated Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, which ensures that organic molecules can be anchored in the interlayer of hydrated vanadates. Simultaneously, the low-polar groups endow organic molecules with a weak interaction with Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; during cycling, thus liberalizing reversible Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transfer. As a result, Al&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; with polar organic molecules displays enhanced electrochemical performance. Furthermore, based on above cathode material, a pouch cell was&#160;assembled by further integrating a dendrite-free N-doped carbon nanofiber@Zn anode, displaying an energy density of 50&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. This work provides a path for designing stable guest species with a weak interaction with Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in the interlayer of layered vanadium oxide towards high-performance cathode materials of aqueous Zn batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Side Area&#8208;Assisted 3D Evaporator with Antibiofouling Function for Ultra&#8208;Efficient Solar Steam Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solar&#8208;driven interfacial steam generation (SISG) system involving an all&#8208;fiber porous cylinder&#8208;like foam 3D evaporator, side area&#8208;assisted evaporation protocol, and aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission&#8208;active solar absorber is explored. The SISG system exhibits a high solar evaporation rate of 3.6&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1, and shows photodynamic killing of bacteria to prevent biofouling.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven interfacial steam generation (SISG) has been recognized as a promising strategy to solve water shortages in an eco&#8208;friendly and low&#8208;cost way. However, the practical application of SISG is vitally restricted by some inherent limits, especially for finite evaporation rate and insufficient working life of evaporator. Herein, a novel SISG system involving an all&#8208;fiber porous cylinder&#8208;like foam 3D evaporator, side area&#8208;assisted evaporation protocol, and aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission&#8208;active solar absorber with &#8220;one stone two birds&#8221; function is explored. The solar absorber exhibits efficient photothermal conversion, endowing the side area&#8208;assisted evaporator with as high as 3.6&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 of solar evaporation rate, which is highly desirable for SISG under 1 sun of irradiation. Moreover, the solar absorber is capable of powerfully producing reactive oxygen species upon sunlight irradiation, which results in extraordinary photodynamic killing of bacteria nearby the fiber to prevent biofouling, consequently improving the working life of evaporator.

         <title>Titania&#8208;Supported Ni2P/Ni Catalysts for Selective Solar&#8208;Driven CO Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Titania&#8208;supported Ni2P/Ni nanoparticle catalysts, obtained through a facile gas&#8211;solid reaction strategy, show a remarkable C2+ selectivity of 70% for solar&#8208;driven CO hydrogenation. Conversely, CO methanation is the dominant process for metallic Ni nanoparticles in the absence of Ni2P. The results reveal a simple phosphidation strategy for tuning the selectivity of Ni&#8208;based catalysts for selective CO hydrogenation to value&#8208;added hydrocarbons.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven Fischer&#8211;Tropsch synthesis (FTS) holds great potential for the sustainable production of fuels from syngas and solar energy. However, the selectivity toward multi&#8208;carbon products (C2+) is often hampered by the difficulty in the regulation of transition metals acting as both light absorption units and active sites. Herein, a partial phosphidation strategy to prepare titania supported Ni2P/Ni catalysts for photothermal FTS is demonstrated. Under Xenon lamp or concentrated sunlight irradiation, the optimized catalyst shows a C2+ selectivity of 70% at a CO conversion of &gt;20%.&#160;Conversely, nickel metal in the absence of Ni2P delivers negligible C2+ products (&#8776;1%) with methane being the major product (&gt;90%). Structural characterization and density functional theory calculation reveal that the partial phosphidation allows exposed metallic Ni to be active for CO adsorption and activation, while the existence of Ni2P/Ni interface is responsible to inhibit CO methanation and promote C&#8211;C coupling of adsorbed *CH intermediates. This work introduces a novel phosphidation strategy for nickel&#8208;based photothermal catalysts in efficiently harnessing solar energy, and regulating the reaction pathways for CO hydrogenation to deliver high value products.

         <title>A Robust Narrow Bandgap Vanadium Tetrasulfide Sonosensitizer Optimized by Charge Separation Engineering for Enhanced Sonodynamic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vanadium tetrasulfide is presented as a new generation of robust narrow&#8208;bandgap sonosensitizer for sonodynamic therapy. The charge separation engineering strategy is also demonstrated to be highly efficient in optimizing its sono&#8208;catalytic performance. Besides, such nanoplatforms are capable of reshaping tumor microenvironments to achieve an excellent tumor therapeutic effect.








Abstract
The development and optimization of sonosensitizers for elevating intratumoral reactive oxygen species (ROS) are definitely appealing in current sonodynamic therapy (SDT). Given this, branched vanadium tetrasulfide (VS4) nanodendrites with a narrower bandgap (compared with the most extensively explored sonosensitizers) are presented as a new source of sonosensitizer, which allows a more effortless separation of sono&#8208;triggered electron&#8211;hole pairs for ROS generation. Specifically, platinum (Pt) nanoparticles and endogenous high levels of glutathione (GSH) are rationally engineered to further optimize its sono&#8208;sensitized performance. As cocatalyst, Pt is conducive to trapping electrons, whereas GSH, as a natural hole&#8208;scavenger, tends to capture holes. Compared with the pristine VS4 sonosensitizer, the GSH&#8208;Pt&#8208;VS4 nanocomposite can greatly prolong the lifetime of the charge and confer a highly efficacious ROS production activity. Furthermore, such nanoplatforms are capable of reshaping tumor microenvironments to realize ROS overproduction, contributed by overcoming tumor hypoxia to improve SDT&#8208;triggered singlet oxygen production, catalyzing endogenic hydrogen peroxide into destructive hydroxyl radicals for chemodynamic therapy, and depleting GSH to amplify intratumoral oxidative stress. All these combined effects result in a significantly efficient tumor suppression outcome. This study enriches sonosensitizer research and proves that sonosensitizers can be rationally optimized by charge separation engineering strategy.

         <title>A Magneto&#8208;Heated Ferrimagnetic Sponge for Continuous Recovery of Viscous Crude Oil</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ferrimagnetic sponge with the skeletons coated with poly(dimethylsiloxane) and iron oxide nanoparticles is developed to achieve continuous recovery of viscous crude oil. Under the exposure of an alternating magnetic field, the viscosity of the viscous oil around the sponge decreases sharply, thus accelerating its absorption.








Abstract
The high viscosity and low fluidity of heavy crude oil hinder its sorption by conventional porous sorbents, so the efficient clean&#8208;up of such heavy crude oil spills is challenging. Recently, Joule heating has been emerging as a new tool to reduce the viscosity of heavy crude oil dramatically. However, this direct&#8208;contact heating approach presents a potential risk due to the high voltage applied. To develop a non&#8208;contact recovery of viscous crude oil, here, a new approach for the fabrication of a series of ferrimagnetic sponges (FMSs) with hydrophobic porous channels is reported, whose surface can be remotely heated to 120 &#176;C within 10 s under an alternating magnetic field (f&#160;= 274&#160;kHz, H&#160;= 30 kA m&#8722;1). Compared with the solar&#8208;driven superficial heating, the integral magnetic heating in FMSs can result in a higher internal temperature of the sponges because of the confinement of thermal transport in the porous channels, which contributes to a dramatic decrease in oil viscosity and a significant increase in oil flow into the pores of FMSs. Furthermore, FMSs assembled with a self&#8208;priming pump can achieve continuous recovery of viscous crude oil (33.05&#160;g h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2) via remotely magnetic heating.

         <title>An Ultra&#8208;Low&#8208;Temperature Elastomer with Excellent Mechanical Performance and Solvent Resistance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of perfluoropolyether (PFPE)&#8208;based elastomers crosslinked by dynamic urethane are reported, which exhibit excellent elasticity at temperature down to &#8722;110 &#176;C&#160;and outstanding ductility within the cryogenic temperature range. Moreover, the high proportion of fluorocarbon segments also provides wonderful compatibility to most organic solvents, accounting for the low&#8208;swelling characteristics of the elastomer in low&#8208;temperature sealing applications.








Abstract
Elastomers presenting good elasticity, ductility, and chemical resistance at low temperatures can serve as superior performers for explorations in extremely cold environments. However, no commercially available elastomer to date can comprehensively fulfill those demands. Here, a perfluoropolyether (PFPE)&#8208;based network crosslinked by dynamic urethane chemistry is demonstrated, which may satisfy the demands of application in ultracold environments. As the crucial constitute in such a crosslinked network, PFPE provides the elastomer with excellent elasticity at a temperature down to &#8722;110 &#176;C&#160;and outstanding ductility within the cryogenic temperature range. Importantly, the high proportion of fluorocarbon segment also provides wonderful compatibility to most organic solvents, accounting for the low&#8208;swelling characteristics of the elastomer in sealing applications. Furthermore, the dynamic crosslinking feature allows the cured elastomer to be reprocessed like thermoplastic polymers, which affords great promise to recycle and reuse the elastomer after its disposal. Inherently, this elastomer would inspire a worldwide interest in the design of elastic devices that are adaptable to extremely low temperature.

         <title>Highly Luminescent Metal&#8208;Free Perovskite Single Crystal for Biocompatible X&#8208;Ray Detector to Attain Highest Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A large metal&#8208;free perovskite MDABCO&#8208;NH4I3 single crystal is grown. The crystal exhibits triplet self&#8208;trapping excitons recombination, a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 53%, and structure&#8208;modulated band nature and luminescence under high pressure. Finally, high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray response and imaging are demonstrated with sensitivity up to 1997 &#177; 80 &#956;C Gy cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed metal&#8208;based halide perovskites have taken a dominant position for perovskite optoelectronics including light emission and X&#8208;ray detection; however, the toxicity of the included heavy metals severely restricts their applications for wearable, lightweight, and transient optoelectronic devices. Here, the authors describe investigations of large (4 &#215; 6 &#215; 2 mm3) 3D metal&#8208;free perovskite MDABCO&#8208;NH4I3 (MDBACO = methyl&#8208;N&#8242;&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octonium) single crystal and its charge recombination and extraction behavior for light emission and X&#8208;ray detection. Unlike conventional 3D metal&#8208;based perovskites, this lightweight and biocompatible perovskite large crystal is processed from aqueous solution at room temperature, and can achieve both an extremely long carrier lifetime up to &#8776;1.03 &#181;s and the formation of self&#8208;trapped excited states for luminescence. These features contribute to a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) as high as &#8776;53% at room temperature and an X&#8208;ray sensitivity up to 1997 &#177; 80 &#956;C Gy&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 50&#160;V bias (highest among all metal&#8208;free detectors). The ability to tune the perovskite band gap by modulating the structure under high pressure is also demonstrated, which opens up applications for the crystal as colored emitters. These attributes make it a molecular alternative to metal&#8208;based perovskites for biocompatible and transient optoelectronics.

         <title>Elucidating the Mechanism of Fast Na Storage Kinetics in Ether Electrolytes for Hard Carbon Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A monodispersed nanospherules hard carbon anode is successfully synthesized, showing excellent electrochemical performance when matched with an ether&#8208;based electrolyte in sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The unique solvated Na+ and Na+ co&#8208;intercalation mechanism and the formed thin solid electrolyte interphase film with low interface impedance in ether&#8208;based electrolytes can significantly accelerate Na storage kinetics for hard carbon anodes.








Abstract
The sodium storage performance of a hard carbon (HC) anode in ether electrolytes exhibits a higher initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) and better rate performance compared to conventional ester electrolytes. However, the mechanism behind faster Na storage kinetics for HC in ether electrolytes remains unclear. Herein, a unique solvated Na+ and Na+ co&#8208;intercalation mechanism in ether electrolytes is reported using designed monodispersed HC nanospheres. In addition, a thin solid electrolyte interphase film with a high inorganic proportion formed in an ether electrolyte is visualized by cryo transmission electron microscopy and depth&#8208;profiling X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, which facilitates Na+ transportation, and results in a high ICE. Furthermore, the fast solvated Na+ diffusion kinetics in ether electrolytes are also revealed via molecular dynamics simulation. Owing to the contribution of the ether electrolytes, an excellent rate performance (214&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 10 A g&#8722;1 with an ultrahigh plateau capacity of 120 mAh g&#8722;1) and a high ICE (84.93% at 1 A g&#8722;1) are observed in a half cell; in a full cell, an attractive specific capacity of 110.3 mAh g&#8722;1 is achieved after 1000 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1.

         <title>A Soft and Absorbable Temporary Epicardial Pacing Wire</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A soft and absorbable temporary epicardial pacing wire (TPW), made of materials approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration [poly(l&#8208;lactide&#8208;co&#8208;&#949;&#8208;caprolactone)] and liquid metal (EGaIn), can pace the heart to recover from abnormal heartbeats after surgery and reduce the severe complications from the rigid and nonabsorbable TPWs.








Abstract
Existing temporary epicardial pacing wires (TPWs) are rigid and non&#8208;absorbable, such that they can cause severe complications after cardiac surgery. Here, a soft and absorbable temporary epicardial pacing wire (saTPW) for effectively correcting abnormal heart rates in a rabbit model, such as bradycardia and ventricular premature beat, is developed. The saTPW exhibits excellent conductivity, flexibility, cycling stability (&gt;100&#160;000 cycles), and less inflammatory response during two&#8208;month subcutaneous implantation in a rat model. The saTPW which consists of poly(l&#8208;lactide&#8208;co&#8208;&#949;&#8208;caprolactone) and liquid metal, can degrade about 13% (mass loss) in the rats over a two&#8208;month subcutaneous implantation. It can be absorbed over time in the body. The cytocompatibility and absorbability avoid secondary injuries caused by remaining wires which are permanently left in the body. The saTPW will provide a great platform for diagnosis and treatments in cardiovascular diseases by delivering the physiological signal and applying electrical stimulation for therapy.

         <dc:description>
A photoactivatable semiconducting polymeric nanoantagonist (ASPA) is presented, whose photothermal and immunomodulation activities are controlled by second near&#8208;infrared light. Such a design can not only elicit tumor ablation and immunogenic cell death, but also initiate immunometabolic reprogramming on the adenosinergic pathway, thereby fostering tumoricidal cytotoxic T cells yet counteracting the immunosuppressive Treg cells in tumor.








Abstract
Immunometabolic modulation offers new opportunities to treat cancers as it is highly associated with cancer progression and immunosuppressive microenvironment. However, traditional regimens using nonselective small&#8208;molecule immunomodulators lead to the off&#8208;target adverse effects and insufficient therapeutic outcomes. Herein a second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) photothermally activatable semiconducting polymeric nanoantagonist (ASPA) for synergistic photothermal immunometabolic therapy of cancer is reported. ASPA backbone is obtained by conjugating vipadenant, an antagonist to adenosine A2A receptor, onto NIR&#8208;II light&#8208;absorbing semiconducting polymer via an azo&#8208;based thermolabile linker. Under deep&#8208;penetrating NIR&#8208;II photoirradiation, ASPA induces tumor thermal ablation and subsequently immunogenic cell death, triggers the cleavage of thermolabile linker, and releases the antagonist to block the immunosuppressive adenosinergic pathway. Such a remotely controlled immunometabolic regulation potentiates cytotoxic T cell functions while suppresses regulatory T cell activities, leading to efficient primary tumor inhibition, pulmonary metastasis prevention, and long&#8208;term immunological memory. Thereby, this work provides a generic polymeric approach for precise spatiotemporal regulation of cancer immunometabolism.

         <title>Dynamic Bifunctional Metasurfaces for Holography and Color Display</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic bifunctional metasurface for color nanoprinting and metaholograms is numerically and experimentally realized. Metaholograms are multiplexed with structural colors by controlling the spectral and phase response of the metasurface. The light diffraction can be switched between the &#8220;ON&#8221; and &#8220;OFF&#8221; states, or remain unchanged for different wavelength with the infiltration of the dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solution, making the colorful holographic images dynamically switchable.








Abstract
Metasurfaces have shown their unprecedented ability in wavefront shaping and triggered various applications with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performances, e.g., color nanoprinting and metaholograms. Recently, these two functions have been combined into a single metasurface to further expand its capabilities. Despite the progress, the current dual&#8208;mode metasurfaces are mostly static and strongly hinder their practical applications. Herein, the realization of dynamic bifunctional metasurfaces is reported. Five metaholograms at two different wavelengths are multiplexed with structural colors by controlling the spectral and phase response of metasurface. Owing to the destructive interference and the resonance on external environment, the light diffraction at particular wavelengths can be switched between &#8220;ON&#8221; and &#8220;OFF&#8221; states, or remain unchanged with the change of surrounding refractive index. Consequently, the encoded metaholograms are selectively turned on and off, making the overall holographic image dynamically switchable. This concept paves a solid step toward practical applications of all&#8208;dielectric metasurfaces.

         <title>Precipitation Hardening in Ferroelectric Ceramics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel ferroelectric hardening method is proposed by precipitating a secondary phase inside of the ferroelectric grains. Akin to hindered dislocation motion in metals, domain wall motion in ferroelectrics is impeded and loss is reduced. The mechanical quality factor in the model system BaTiO3&#8211;CaTiO3 is enhanced by 1.5 times, while the piezoelectric coefficient and planar electromechanical coupling factor remain nearly unchanged.








Abstract
Domain wall motion in ferroics, similar to dislocation motion in metals, can be tuned by well&#8208;concepted microstructural elements. In demanding high&#8208;power applications of piezoelectric materials, the domain wall motion is considered as a lossy hysteretic mechanism that should be restricted. Current applications for so&#8208;called hard piezoelectrics are abundant and hinge on the use of an acceptor&#8208;doping scheme. However, this mechanism features severe limitations due to enhanced mobility of oxygen vacancies at moderate temperatures. By analogy with metal technology, the authors present here a new solution for electroceramics, where precipitates are utilized to pin domain walls and improve piezoelectric properties. Through a sequence of sintering, nucleation, and precipitate growth, intragranular precipitates leading to a fine domain structure are developed as shown by transmission electron microscopy, piezoresponse force microscopy, and phase&#8208;field simulation. This structure impedes the domain wall motion as elucidated by electromechanical characterization. As a result, the mechanical quality factor is increased by &#8776;50% and the hysteresis in electrostrain is suppressed considerably. This is even achieved with slightly increased piezoelectric coefficient and electromechanical coupling factor. This novel process can be smoothly implemented in industrial production processes and is accessible to simple laboratory experimentation for microstructure optimization and implementation in various ferroelectric systems.

         <title>Molecular Alignment of Homoleptic Iridium Phosphors in Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>

Dopant alignment in doped, vacuum&#8208;deposited films can be promoted by molecular asymmetry and/or asymmetry in the dopant's electrostatic surface potential.








Abstract
The orientation of facial (fac) tris&#8208;cyclometalated iridium complexes in doped films prepared by vacuum deposition is investigated by altering the physical shape and electronic asymmetry in the molecular structure. Angle&#8208;dependent photoluminescence spectroscopy and Fourier&#8208;plane imaging microscopy show that the orientation of roughly spherical fac&#8208;tris(2&#8208;phenylpyridyl)iridium (Ir(ppy)3) is isotropic, whereas complexes that are oblate spheroids, fac&#8208;tris(mesityl&#8208;2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole)iridium (Ir(mi)3) and fac&#8208;tris((3,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;[1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4&#8208;yl)&#8208;2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole)iridium (Ir(mip)3), have a net horizontal alignment of their transition dipole moments. Optical anisotropy factors of 0.26 and 0.15, respectively, are obtained from the latter complexes when doped into tris(4&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)phenyl)amine host thin films. The horizontal alignment is attributed to the favorable van der Waals interaction between the oblate Ir complexes and host material. Trifluoromethyl groups substituted on one polar face of the Ir(ppy)3 and Ir(mi)3 complexes introduce chemical asymmetries in the molecules at the expense of their oblate shapes. The anisotropy factors of films doped with these substituted derivatives are lower relative to the parent complexes, indicating that the fluorinated patches reinforce horizontal alignment during deposition. High efficiencies obtained from organic light emitting diodes prepared using the Ir dopants is attributed, in part, to improved outcoupling of electroluminescence brought about by molecular alignment.

         <title>Hydrogel Ionic Diodes toward Harvesting Ultralow&#8208;Frequency Mechanical Energy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrogel ionic diode for ultralow&#8208;frequency mechanical&#8208;energy harvesting is designed based on a sandwiched structure of anion and cation ionomers in hydrogels embedded with carbon nanotubes and silver nanowire electrodes. The ionic diode exhibits power density, charge density, and harvested energy that outperform current energy&#8208;harvesting devices by several orders of magnitude at 0.01&#160;Hz.








Abstract
Energy harvesting from human motion is regarded as a promising protocol for powering portable electronics, biomedical devices, and smart objects of the Internet of things. However, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art mechanical&#8208;energy&#8208;harvesting devices generally operate at frequencies (&gt;10&#160;Hz) well beyond human activity frequencies. Here, a hydrogel ionic diode formed by the layered structures of anionic and cationic ionomers in hydrogels is presented. As confirmed by finite element analysis, the underlying mechanism of the hydrogel ionic diode involves the formation of the depletion region by mobile cations and anions and the subsequent increase of the built&#8208;in potential across the depletion region in response to mechanical pressure. Owing to the enhanced ionic rectification ratio by the embedded carbon nanotube and silver nanowire electrodes, the hydrogel ionic diode exhibits a power density of &#8776;5&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2 and a charge density of &#8776;4&#160;mC&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 0.01&#160;Hz, outperforming the current energy&#8208;harvesting devices by several orders of magnitude. The applications of the self&#8208;powered hydrogel ionic diode to tactile sensing, pressure imaging, and touchpads are demonstrated, with sensing limitation is as low as 0.01&#160;kPa. This work is expected to open up new opportunities for ionic&#8208;current&#8208;based ionotronics in electronics and energy devices.

&lt;p&gt;Energy harvesting from human motion is regarded as a promising protocol for powering portable electronics, biomedical devices, and smart objects of the Internet of things. However, state-of-the-art mechanical-energy-harvesting devices generally operate at frequencies (&lt;b&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/b&gt;10&#160;Hz) well beyond human activity frequencies. Here, a hydrogel ionic diode formed by the layered structures of anionic and cationic ionomers in hydrogels is presented. As confirmed by finite element analysis, the underlying mechanism of the hydrogel ionic diode involves the formation of the depletion region by mobile cations and anions and the subsequent increase of the built-in potential across the depletion region in response to mechanical pressure. Owing to the enhanced ionic rectification ratio by the embedded carbon nanotube and silver nanowire electrodes, the hydrogel ionic diode exhibits a power density of &lt;b&gt;&#8776;&lt;/b&gt;5&#160;mW&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a charge density of &lt;b&gt;&#8776;&lt;/b&gt;4&#160;mC&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.01&#160;Hz, outperforming the current energy-harvesting devices by several orders of magnitude. The applications of the self-powered hydrogel ionic diode to tactile sensing, pressure imaging, and touchpads are demonstrated, with sensing limitation is as low as 0.01&#160;kPa. This work is expected to open up new opportunities for ionic-current-based ionotronics in electronics and energy devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spin&#8211;Orbit Torque&#8208;Induced Domain Nucleation for Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dominant mode of field&#8208;free magnetization switching in L11&#8208;CuPt/CoPt bilayer is demonstrated to be domain nucleation. The stable intermediate states from domain nucleation grant excellent memristive plasticity, which allows the spintronic device to be used as an artificial sigmoidal neuron. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept live training is performed to recognize written digits, with a high recognition rate comparable to simulation.








Abstract
Neuromorphic computing has become an increasingly popular approach for artificial intelligence because it can perform cognitive tasks more efficiently than conventional computers. However, it remains challenging to develop dedicated hardware for artificial neural networks. Here, a simple bilayer spintronic device for hardware implementation of neuromorphic computing is demonstrated. In L11&#8208;CuPt/CoPt bilayer, current&#8208;inducted field&#8208;free magnetization switching by symmetry&#8208;dependent spin&#8211;orbit torques shows a unique domain nucleation&#8208;dominated magnetization reversal, which is not accessible in conventional bilayers. Gradual domain nucleation creates multiple intermediate magnetization states which form the basis of a sigmoidal neuron. Using the L11&#8208;CuPt/CoPt bilayer as a sigmoidal neuron, the training of a deep learning network to recognize written digits, with a high recognition rate (87.5%) comparable to simulation (87.8%) is further demonstrated. This work offers a new scheme of implementing artificial neural networks by magnetic domain nucleation.

         <title>Interfacial Embedding of Laser&#8208;Manufactured Fluorinated Gold Clusters Enabling Stable Perovskite Solar Cells with Efficiency Over 24%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrophobic p&#8208;type semiconducting additive, fluorinated&#8208;gold&#8208;clusters, is used as a bifunctional interfacial mediator to efficiently modulate the carrier dynamics of perovskite and restrain the perovskite from degradation by external environmental stimuli, which results in an n&#8211;i&#8211;p perovskite solar cell with a champion efficiency up to 24.02% and moisture stability over 10 000 h in relative humidity of 75%.








Abstract
Tackling the interfacial loss in emerged perovskite&#8208;based solar cells (PSCs) to address synchronously the carrier dynamics and the environmental stability, has been of fundamental and viable importance, while technological hurdles remain in not only creating such interfacial mediator, but the subsequent interfacial embedding in the active layer. This article reports a strategy of interfacial embedding of hydrophobic fluorinated&#8208;gold&#8208;clusters (FGCs) for highly efficient and stable PSCs. The p&#8208;type semiconducting feature enables the FGC efficient interfacial mediator to improve the carrier dynamics by reducing the interfacial carrier transfer barrier and boosting the charge extraction at grain boundaries. The hydrophobic tails of the gold clusters and the hydrogen bonding between fluorine groups and perovskite favor the enhancement of environmental stability. Benefiting from these merits, highly efficient formamidinium lead iodide PSCs (champion efficiency up to 24.02%) with enhanced phase stability under varied relative humidity (RH) from 40% to 95%, as well as highly efficient mixed&#8208;cation PSCs with moisture stability (RH of 75%) over 10 000 h are achieved. It is thus inspiring to advance the development of highly efficient and stable PSCs via interfacial embedding laser&#8208;generated additives for improved charge transfer/extraction and environmental stability.

         <title>Directional Magnetization Reversal Enables Ultrahigh Energy Density in Gradient Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A directional magnetization reversal is discovered by engineering Nd2Fe14B/&#945;&#8208;Fe gradient nanostructures, in contrast to the conventional random and nonuniform magnetization reversal in ferromagnetics. This directional magnetization reversal enables a rare combination of high saturation magnetization and high coercivity, thus leading to a record&#8208;high energy product of 26 MG Oe for isotropic permanent magnetic materials.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance ferromagnetic materials are essential for energy conversion and electronic devices. However, the random and nonuniform magnetization reversal in ferromagnetics limits their performance that can be achieved. Here, through both micromagnetism simulations and experiments, a directional magnetization reversal that initiates first from large grains toward smaller ones is discovered by engineering Nd2Fe14B/&#945;&#8208;Fe gradient nanostructures. Such directional magnetization reversal enables a rare combination of high magnetization and large coercivity, thus leading to a record&#8208;high energy density (26 MG Oe) for isotropic permanent magnetic materials, which is &#8776;50% higher than that of its gradient&#8208;free counterpart. The unusual magnetization reversal originates from an ordered arrangement of grain sizes in the gradient material, where the large grains have a lower reversal field than that of the smaller ones. These findings open up new opportunities for developing high&#8208;performance magnetic materials.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Chiral Light&#8208;Emitting Diode Based on Strained Monolayer Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A room&#8208;temperature electrically tunable chiral light&#8208;emitting diode is realized using strained monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides. The strain effects break the threefold rotational symmetry, which results in different amounts of spin recombination at the K/K&#8217; valleys, to generate chiral light emission driven by electric fields. The results provide a new pathway for practical chiral light sources based on monolayer semiconductors.








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature chiral light sources whose optical helicity can be electrically switched are one of the most important devices for future optical quantum information processing. The emerging valley degree of freedom in monolayer semiconductors allows generation of chiral luminescence via valley polarization. However, relevant valley&#8208;polarized light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) have only been achieved at low temperatures (typically below 80 K). Here, a room&#8208;temperature chiral LED with strained transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers is realized. Spatially resolved polarization spectroscopy reveals that strain effects are crucial to yielding robust valley&#8208;polarized electroluminescence. The broken threefold rotational symmetry of strained monolayers induce inequivalent valley drifts at the K/K&#8217; valleys, resulting in different amounts of spin recombination driven by electric fields. Based on this scenario, ideally strained conditions are designed for LEDs on flexible substrates, in which the helicity of room&#8208;temperature valley&#8208;polarized electroluminescence is electrically tuned. The results provide a new pathway for practical chiral light sources based on monolayer semiconductors.

A general and effective strategy is delivered to modulate the 2D/3D microstructure of tin&#8208;perovskite films by introduction of a 2D phase with the function of FPEABr, which induces high&#8208;orientation growth of 3D&#160;FASnI3 by embracing the 3D grains at their surfaces and boundaries. That leads to a breakthrough of device performance of 14.81% in power conversion efficiency, along with 14.03% certified.








Abstract
As the most promising lead&#8208;free one, tin&#8208;halides based perovskite solar cells still suffer from the severe bulk&#8208;defect due to the easy oxidation of tin from divalent to tetravalent. Here, a general and effective strategy is delivered to modulate the microstructure of 2D/3D heterogeneous tin&#8208;perovskite absorber films by substituting FAI with FPEABr in FASnI3. The introduction of 2D&#160;phase can induce highly oriented growth of 3D FASnI3 and it is revealed in the optimal 2D/3D film that 2D phase embraces 3D grains and locates at the surfaces and grain boundaries. The FPEA+ based 2D tin&#8208;perovskite capping layer can offer a reducing atmosphere for vulnerable 3D FASnI3 grains. The unique microstructure effectively suppresses the well&#8208;known oxidation from Sn2+ to Sn4+, as well as decreasing defect density, which leads to a remarkable enhanced device performance from 9.38% to 14.81% in conversion efficiency. The certified conversion efficiency of 14.03% announces a new record and moves a remarkable step from the last one (12.4%). Besides of this breakthrough, this work definitely paves a new way to fabricate high&#8208;quality tin&#8208;perovskite absorber film by constructing effective 2D/3D microstructures.

Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes
A room&#8208;temperature electrically tunable chiral light&#8208;emitting diode is realized by Jiang Pu, Taishi Takenobu, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2100601, using strained monolayer transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides. The strain effects break the three&#8208;fold rotational symmetry, which results in different amounts of spin recombination at the K/K' valleys to generate chiral light emission driven by electric fields. The results provide a new pathway for practical chiral light sources based on monolayer semiconductors.

Coatings
In article number 2102349, Yixin Zhang and co&#8208;workers report an amphiphilic coating for glass surfaces, on which small droplets of polar aprotic organic solvents can be deposited with an enhanced contact angle (small feature size) and inhibited motion (strong binding), permitting fully automated multiple rounds of combinatorial synthesis of small&#8208;molecule compounds and peptides. The amphiphilic coating can be switched to hydrophilic network for protein&#8208; and cell&#8208;based screening.

Environmental Remediation
In article number 2100074, Yang Lu, Shu&#8208;Hong Yu, and co&#8208;workers report ferrimagnetic sponges for continuous recovery of viscous crude oil under the exposure of alternating magnetic field. The viscosity of crude oil around the magneto&#8208;heated sponge decreases sharply, thus accelerating the absorption into the sponge and achieving continuous recovery.

Quasicrystals
In article number 2102507, Kaoru Kimura, Ryo Yoshida, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate that machine&#8208;learning algorithms can predict the chemical composition of new quasicrystals. Furthermore, analyzing the input&#8211;output relationships black&#8208;boxed into the machine&#8208;learning model, they successfully identify nontrivial empirical equations interpretable by humans that describe the conditions necessary for stable quasicrystal formation. This is the first step toward understanding the formation mechanism of quasicrystals, which has been long sought in quasicrystal research.

Biomedical Applications
In article number 2102624, Songwan Jin and co&#8208;workers generate liver spheroids that resemble the in vivo structure of the lobules. The structural integrity is maintained for several days, engendering an increased performance of cellular function. This is achieved thanks to the combination of two cutting edge technologies: preset&#8208;extrusion 3D bioprinting and microfluidics. Moreover, structured microtissues once injected into animals show a better engraftment, bringing to light the importance of phenotypically relevant models not only for drug screening but also regenerative medicine.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Cathode Materials for Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries: Structural Design and Electrochemical Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) are now receiving increasing research attention due to their obvious advantage regarding the potassium reserves. Cathode materials, which determine the energy density of PIBs, usually suffer from serious structural deformation during continuous K+ (de)intercalation. Therefore, proper structural&#8208;design principles of cathode materials should be focused on to ensure high performance to promote the further development of PIBs.








Abstract
Due to the obvious advantage in potassium reserves, potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) are now receiving increasing research attention as an alternative energy storage system for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Unfortunately, the large size of K+ makes it a challenging task to identify suitable electrode materials, particularly cathode ones that determine the energy density of PIBs, capable of tolerating the serious structural deformation during the continuous intercalation/deintercalation of K+. It is therefore of paramount importance that proper design principles of cathode materials be followed to ensure stable electrochemical performance if a practical application of PIBs is expected. Herein, the current knowledge on the structural engineering of cathode materials acquired during the battle against its performance degradation is summarized. The K+ storage behavior of different types of cathodes is discussed in detail and the structure&#8211;performance relationship of materials sensitive to their different lattice frameworks is highlighted. The key issues facing the future development of different categories of cathode materials are also highlighted and perspectives for potential approaches and strategies to promote the further development of PIBs are provided.

         <dc:description>
As an extension of single&#8208;atom catalysts, dual&#8208;atomic&#8208;site catalysts (DASCs) with high metal loading, sophisticated and flexible active sites have aroused great interest. The recent development of DASCs in characterization, synthetic methods, and catalytic applications are reviewed.








Abstract
Atomically dispersed metal catalysts with well&#8208;defined structures have been the research hotspot in heterogeneous catalysis because of their high atomic utilization efficiency, outstanding activity, and selectivity. Dual&#8208;atomic&#8208;site catalysts (DASCs), as an extension of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), have recently drawn surging attention. The DASCs possess higher metal loading, more sophisticated and flexible active sites, offering more chance for achieving better catalytic performance, compared with SACs. In this review, recent advances on how to design new DASCs for enhancing energy catalysis will be highlighted. It will start with the classification of marriage of two kinds of single&#8208;atom active sites, homonuclear DASCs and heteronuclear DASCs according to the configuration of active sites. Then, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art characterization techniques for DASCs will be discussed. Different synthetic methods and catalytic applications of the DASCs in various reactions, including oxygen reduction reaction, carbon dioxide reduction reaction, carbon monoxide oxidation reaction, and others will be followed. Finally, the major challenges and perspectives of DASCs will be provided.

         <title>Pushing the Limits of Flexibility and Stretchability of Solar Cells: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible and stretchable solar cells are important for a range of emerging applications such as electronic skins, e&#8208;textiles, wearable displays and health sensors, among others. An overview of stretchable optoelectronics is provided, where the benefits of stretchable solar cells are addressed, and the progress made in this field in terms of efficiency and strategies to achieve mechanical stretchability are underlined.








Abstract
Emerging forms of soft, flexible, and stretchable electronics promise to revolutionize the electronics industries of the future offering radically new products that combine multiple functionalities, including power generation, with arbitrary form factor. For example, skin&#8208;like electronics promise to transform the human&#8208;machine&#8208;interface, but the softness of the skin is incompatible with traditional electronic components. To address this issue, new strategies toward soft and wearable electronic systems are currently being pursued, which also include stretchable photovoltaics as self&#8208;powering systems for use in autonomous and stretchable electronics of the future. Here recent developments in the field of stretchable photovoltaics are reviewed and their potential for various emerging applications are examined.

     alt="Pushing the Limits of Flexibility and Stretchability of Solar Cells: A Review"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flexible and stretchable solar cells are important for a range of emerging applications such as electronic skins, e-textiles, wearable displays and health sensors, among others. An overview of stretchable optoelectronics is provided, where the benefits of stretchable solar cells are addressed, and the progress made in this field in terms of efficiency and strategies to achieve mechanical stretchability are underlined.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerging forms of soft, flexible, and stretchable electronics promise to revolutionize the electronics industries of the future offering radically new products that combine multiple functionalities, including power generation, with arbitrary form factor. For example, skin-like electronics promise to transform the human-machine-interface, but the softness of the skin is incompatible with traditional electronic components. To address this issue, new strategies toward soft and wearable electronic systems are currently being pursued, which also include stretchable photovoltaics as self-powering systems for use in autonomous and stretchable electronics of the future. Here recent developments in the field of stretchable photovoltaics are reviewed and their potential for various emerging applications are examined. Emphasis is placed on the different strategies to induce stretchability including extrinsic and intrinsic approaches. In the former case, engineering and patterning of the materials and devices are key elements while intrinsically stretchable systems rely on mechanically compliant materials such as elastomers and organic conjugated polymers. The result is a review article that provides a comprehensive summary of the progress to date in the field of stretchable solar cells from the nanoscale to macroscopic functional devices. The article is concluded by discussing the emerging trends and future developments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Meta&#8208;Analysis of Conductive and Strong Carbon Nanotube Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A meta&#8208;analysis of 1304 data points collated over 266 papers statistically evaluates the relationships between carbon nanotube (CNT) material characteristics, at an extrinsic and intrinsic level, and compares them to graphitic intercalation compounds and conductive polymers. An unrivaled deep dive into the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art, it provides a roadmap to developing advanced CNT conductors simultaneously competitive with copper and carbon fiber.








Abstract
A study of 1304 data points collated over 266 papers statistically evaluates the relationships between carbon nanotube (CNT) material characteristics, including: electrical, mechanical, and thermal properties; ampacity; density; purity; microstructure alignment; molecular dimensions and graphitic perfection; and doping. Compared to conductive polymers and graphitic intercalation compounds, which have exceeded the electrical conductivity of copper, CNT materials are currently one&#8208;sixth of copper's conductivity, mechanically on&#8208;par with synthetic or carbon fibers, and exceed all the other materials in terms of a multifunctional metric. Doped, aligned few&#8208;wall CNTs (FWCNTs) are the most superior CNT category; from this, the acid&#8208;spun fiber subset are the most conductive, and the subset of fibers directly spun from floating catalyst chemical vapor deposition are strongest on a weight basis. The thermal conductivity of multiwall CNT material rivals that of FWCNT materials. Ampacity follows a diameter&#8208;dependent power&#8208;law from nanometer to millimeter scales. Undoped, aligned FWCNT material reaches the intrinsic conductivity of CNT bundles and single&#8208;crystal graphite, illustrating an intrinsic limit requiring doping for copper&#8208;level conductivities. Comparing an assembly of CNTs (forming mesoscopic bundles, then macroscopic material) to an assembly of graphene (forming single&#8208;crystal graphite crystallites, then carbon fiber), the &#8776;1 &#181;m room&#8208;temperature, phonon&#8208;limited mean&#8208;free&#8208;path shared between graphene, metallic CNTs, and activated semiconducting CNTs is highlighted, deemphasizing all metallic helicities for CNT power transmission applications.

         <title>First&#8208;Principles Multiscale Modeling of Mechanical Properties in Graphene/Borophene Heterostructures Empowered by Machine&#8208;Learning Interatomic Potentials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust concept of first&#8208;principles multiscale modeling of mechanical properties based on machine&#8208;learning interatomic potentials conveniently trainable over short ab initio datasets is proposed. It is shown that mechanical/failure responses of complex nanostructures at continuum scale and high temperatures can be explored with the precision of sophisticated first&#8208;principles calculations, affordable computational cost, and without the need for empirical data.








Abstract
Density functional theory calculations are robust tools to explore the mechanical properties of pristine structures at their ground state but become exceedingly expensive for large systems at finite temperatures. Classical molecular dynamics (CMD) simulations offer the possibility to study larger systems at elevated temperatures, but they require accurate interatomic potentials. Herein the authors propose the concept of first&#8208;principles multiscale modeling of mechanical properties, where ab initio level of accuracy is hierarchically bridged to explore the mechanical/failure response of macroscopic systems. It is demonstrated that machine&#8208;learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) fitted to ab initio datasets play a pivotal role in achieving this goal. To practically illustrate this novel possibility, the mechanical/failure response of graphene/borophene coplanar heterostructures is examined. It is shown that MLIPs conveniently outperform popular CMD models for graphene and borophene and they can evaluate the mechanical properties of pristine and heterostructure phases at room temperature. Based on the information provided by the MLIP&#8208;based CMD, continuum models of heterostructures using the finite element method can be constructed. The study highlights that MLIPs were&#160;the missing block for conducting first&#8208;principles multiscale modeling, and their employment empowers a straightforward route to bridge ab initio level accuracy and flexibility to explore the mechanical/failure response of nanostructures at continuum scale.

         <title>2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Perovskite with Ordered Phase Distribution for High&#8208;Performance Self&#8208;Powered Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance self&#8208;powered photodetector based on a 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskite with an ordered phase distribution is presented. The increased built&#8208;in potential due to the gradient phase distribution, oriented crystals, and improved crystal quality jointly contribute to the high photoresponse of the device in the entire response spectrum range.








Abstract
2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskites exhibit great potential in optoelectronic devices for superior stability compared with their 3D counterparts. However, to achieve a high level of device performance, it is crucial but challenging to regulate the phase distribution of 2D perovskites to facilitate charge carrier transfer. Herein, using a solvent additive method (adding a small amount of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF)) combined with a hot&#8208;casting process, the phase distribution of (PEA)2MA3Pb4I13 (PEA+&#160;= C6H5CH2CH2NH3+, MA+&#160;= CH3NH3+) perovskite can be well controlled and the Fermi level of perovskites along the film thickness direction can achieve gradient distribution. The increased built&#8208;in potential, oriented crystal, and improved crystal quality jointly contribute to the high photoresponse of devices in the entire response spectrum range. The optimum device exhibits a characteristic detection peak at 570&#160;nm with large responsivity/detectivity (0.44 A W&#8722;1/3.38 &#215; 1012 Jones), ultrafast response speed with a rise/fall time of 20.8/20.6 &#181;s, and improved stability. This work suggests the possibility of manipulating the ordered phase distribution of 2D perovskites toward high&#8208;performance and stable optoelectronic conversion devices.

         <title>Monolithic Tandem Multicolor Image Sensor Based on Electrochromic Color&#8208;Radix Demultiplexing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new design of a broadband color&#8208;tunable photodetector and its high&#8208;accuracy digital color&#8208;discrimination scheme is presented. Vertically stacked p&#8208;type and n&#8208;type graphene barristors demonstrates a superior capability of regulating charge transport under any desired illumination wavelengths, yielding voltage&#8208;controlled photoconductive gain spectra. An array of optoelectronic logic sensors that can demultiplex color coordinates with high color accuracy is demonstrated.








Abstract
Optical data acquisition has been set as one of the milestones to testify the developments aimed at harnessing the full potential of the spatial and temporal data processing capabilities of the advanced semiconductor technology. A highly promising approach to drive the level of acquisition beyond the current technological node is the vertical integration of multiple photodetectors. However, vertical integration so far requires the same level of circuit complexity as lateral integration from the incapability of monolithic integration. Here, an electrochromic device architecture is introduced that enables realization of a monolithic tandem multicolor photodetector. The device, composed of vertically stacked p&#8208;type and n&#8208;type graphene barristors, is demonstrated to be capable of regulating the balanced charge transport under any desired illumination wavelengths. It exhibits variable anti&#8208;ambipolar charge transport behavior, which yields sensitive voltage&#8208;controlled photoconductive gain spectra. These electrical behaviors are utilized to fabricate an optoelectronic logic sensor that can demultiplex the desired color coordinate or wavelength in the constituent array with high color accuracy.

         <title>New Insights into the High&#8208;Performance Black Phosphorus Anode for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A well&#8208;designed black phosphorus&#8211;graphite&#8211;carbon nanotube composite (BP/G/CNTs) shows stable high&#8208;current cycling performance at 2 A g&#8722;1. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy study of this material reveals the precise reaction mechanism of BP and Li+ during cycling.








Abstract
Black phosphorus (BP) is a promising anode material in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) owing to its high electrical conductivity and capacity. However, the huge volume change of BP during cycling induces rapid capacity fading. In addition, the unclear electrochemical mechanism of BP hinders the development of rational designs and preparation of high&#8208;performance BP&#8208;based anodes. Here, a high&#8208;performance nanostructured BP&#8211;graphite&#8211;carbon nanotubes composite (BP/G/CNTs) synthesized using ball&#8208;milling method is reported. The BP/G/CNTs anode delivers a high initial capacity of 1375&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 0.15 A g&#8722;1 and maintains 1031.7&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 after 450 cycles. Excellent high&#8208;rate performance is demonstrated with a capacity of 508.1&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 after 3000 cycles at 2 A g&#8722;1. Moreover, for the first time, direct evidence is provided experimentally to present the electrochemical mechanism of BP anodes with three&#8208;step lithiation and delithiation using ex situ X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), ex situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), ex situ X&#8208;ray emission spectroscopy, operando XRD, and operando XAS, which reveal the formation of Li3P7, LiP, and Li3P. Furthermore, the study indicates an open&#8208;circuit relaxation effect of the electrode with ex situ and operando XAS analyses.

         <title>Highly Permeable DNA Supramolecular Hydrogel Promotes Neurogenesis and Functional Recovery after Completely Transected Spinal Cord Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA supramolecular hydrogel carrying neural stem cells (NSCs) is applied to repair spinal cord injury. A renascent neural network is formed at the lesion site via the proliferation and differentiation of NSCs. Due to the newly formed synapses at the lesion area, rats recover basic hindlimb function with detectable motor&#8208;evoked potentials.








Abstract
Regeneration after severe spinal cord injury cannot occur naturally in mammals. Transplanting stem cells to the injury site is a highly promising method, but it faces many challenges because it relies heavily on the microenvironment provided by both the lesion site and delivery material. Although mechanical properties, biocompatibility, and biodegradability of delivery materials have been extensively explored, their permeability has rarely been recognized. Here, a DNA hydrogel is designed with extremely high permeability to repair a 2 mm spinal cord gap in Sprague&#8211;Dawley rats. The rats recover basic hindlimb function with detectable motor&#8208;evoked potentials, and a renascent neural network is formed via the proliferation and differentiation of both implanted and endogenous stem cells. The signal at the lesion area is conveyed by, on average, 15 newly formed synapses. This hydrogel system offers great potential in clinical trials. Further, it should be easily adaptable to other tissue regeneration applications.

         <title>Surface Diffusion and Epitaxial Self&#8208;Planarization for Wafer&#8208;Scale Single&#8208;Grain Metal Chalcogenide Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wafer&#8208;scale growth of single&#8208;grain 2D metal chalcogenides remains a challenge in the commercialization of various electronic devices based on these materials. A generalized surface&#8208;diffusion&#8208;induced epitaxial self&#8208;planarization method to produce wafer&#8208;scale single&#8208;grain metal chalcogenide thin films is described. This process also enables the practical applications of single&#8208;grain metal chalcogenides without involving a transfer process.








Abstract
Although wafer&#8208;scale single&#8208;grain thin films of 2D metal chalcogenides (MCs) have been extensively sought after during the last decade, the grain size of the MC thin films is still limited in the sub&#8208;millimeter scale. A general strategy of synthesizing wafer&#8208;scale single&#8208;grain MC thin films by using commercial wafers (Si, Ge, GaAs) both as metal source and epitaxial collimator is presented. A new mechanism of single&#8208;grain thin&#8208;film formation, surface diffusion, and epitaxial self&#8208;planarization is proposed, where chalcogen elements migrate preferentially along substrate surface and the epitaxial crystal domains flow to form an atomically smooth thin film. Through synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and high&#8208;resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy, the formation of single&#8208;grain Si2Te3, GeTe, GeSe, and GaTe thin films on (111) Si, Ge, and (100) GaAs is verified. The Si2Te3 thin film is used to achieve transfer&#8208;free fabrication of a high&#8208;performance bipolar memristive electrical&#8208;switching device.

         <title>A Nearly Packaging&#8208;Free Design Paradigm for Light, Powerful, and Energy&#8208;Dense Primary Microbatteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Billions of internet&#8208;connected devices require microbattery power sources, but their operating times are severely limited by the poor scaling of battery energy density. This work presents a new design paradigm for primary microbatteries that drastically improves energy and power density by eliminating the majority of packaging and using thick and dense electrodes with controlled crystal orientation for fast transport.








Abstract
Billions of internet connected devices used for medicine, wearables, and robotics require microbattery power sources, but the conflicting scaling laws between electronics and energy storage have led to inadequate power sources that severely limit the performance of these physically small devices. Reported here is a new design paradigm for primary microbatteries that drastically improves energy and power density by eliminating the vast majority of the packaging and through the use of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density anode and cathode materials. These light (50&#8211;80&#160;mg) and small (20&#8211;40&#160;&#181;L) microbatteries are enabled though the electroplating of 130&#160;&#181;m&#8208;thick 94% dense additive&#8208;free and crystallographically oriented LiCoO2 onto thin metal foils, which also act as the encapsulation layer. These devices have 430&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and 1050&#160;Wh L&#8722;1 energy densities, 4 times the energy density of previous similarly sized microbatteries, opening up the potential to power otherwise unpowerable microdevices.

A smartphone&#8208;enabled Digital Light Processing (DLP) 3D printer based on a smartphone&#8208;powered projector and a customized touchscreen smartphone app is developed, featuring portability, modularity, and an easy&#8208;to&#8208;use interface. The ability of printing with versatile materials covers commercial resins and several hydrogel&#8208;based (bio)inks. This platform is proven to be applicable to fabrication of medical implants, in situ bioprinting, and integration with a 3D object&#8208;scanning app.








Abstract
3D printing has emerged as an enabling approach in a variety of different fields. However, the bulk volume of printing systems limits the expansion of their applications. In this study, a portable 3D Digital Light Processing (DLP) printer is built based on a smartphone&#8208;powered projector and a custom&#8208;written smartphone&#8208;operated app. Constructs with detailed surface architectures, porous features, or hollow structures, as well as sophisticated tissue analogs, are successfully printed using this platform, by utilizing commercial resins as well as a range of hydrogel&#8208;based inks, including poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;diacrylate, gelatin methacryloyl, or allylated gelatin. Moreover, due to the portability of the unique DLP printer, medical implants can be fabricated for point&#8208;of&#8208;care usage, and cell&#8208;laden tissues can be produced in situ, achieving a new milestone for mobile&#8208;health technologies. Additionally, the all&#8208;in&#8208;one printing system described herein enables the integration of the 3D scanning smartphone app to obtain object&#8208;derived 3D digital models for subsequent printing. Along with further developments, this portable, modular, and easy&#8208;to&#8208;use smartphone&#8208;enabled DLP printer is anticipated to secure exciting opportunities for applications in resource&#8208;limited and point&#8208;of&#8208;care settings not only in biomedicine but also for home and educational purposes.

         <title>Avoiding the Center&#8208;Symmetry Trap: Programmed Assembly of Dipolar Precursors into Porous, Crystalline Molecular Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer growth is used to stack asymmetric, dipolar organic building units on inorganic substrates, permitting porous, crystalline molecular materials that lack inversion symmetry. This programmed assembly yields electric fields orientated normal to the substrate. This electrostatic design creates possibilities for band structure engineering and also results in nonlinear optical activity (second&#8208;harmonic generation).








Abstract
Liquid&#8208;phase, quasi&#8208;epitaxial growth is used to stack asymmetric, dipolar organic compounds on inorganic substrates, permitting porous, crystalline molecular materials that lack inversion symmetry. This allows material fabrication with built&#8208;in electric fields. A new programmed assembly strategy based on metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is described that facilitates crystalline, noncentrosymmetric space groups for achiral compounds. Electric fields are integrated into crystalline, porous thin films with an orientation normal to the substrate. Changes in electrostatic potential are detected via core&#8208;level shifts of marker atoms on the MOF thin films and agree with theoretical results. The integration of built&#8208;in electric fields into organic, crystalline, and porous materials creates possibilities for band structure engineering to control the alignment of electronic levels in organic molecules. Built&#8208;in electric fields may also be used to tune the transfer of charges from donors loaded via programmed assembly into MOF pores. Applications include organic electronics, photonics, and nonlinear optics, since the absence of inversion symmetry results in a clear second&#8208;harmonic generation signal.

         <title>Ordered Macroporous Carbonous Frameworks Implanted with CdS Quantum Dots for Efficient Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D ordered macroporous N&#8208;doped&#8208;carbon&#8208;supported CdS quantum dots are fabricated via an in situ transformation strategy. The as&#8208;prepared materials exhibit superior activity and selectivity in photocatalytic CO2 reduction coupled with amines oxidation, affording a CO production rate as high as 5210 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 under the irradiation of visible light in the absence of any sacrificial agents and alkaline additives.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven photocatalytic CO2 reduction is regarded as a promising way to simultaneously mitigate the energy crisis and CO2 pollution. However, achieving high efficiency of photocatalytic CO2 reduction, especially without the assistance of sacrifice reagents or extra alkaline additives, remains a critical issue. Herein, a photocatalyst of 3D ordered macroporous N&#8208;doped carbon (NC) supported CdS quantum dots (3DOM CdSQD/NC) is successfully fabricated toward photocatalytic CO2 reduction via an in situ transformation strategy. Additionally, an amines oxidation reaction is introduced to replace the H2O oxidation process to further boost the photocatalytic CO2 reduction efficiency. Impressively, 3DOM CdSQD/NC exhibits superior activity and selectivity in photocatalytic CO2 reduction coupled with amines oxidation, affording a CO production rate as high as 5210 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in the absence of any sacrificial agents and alkaline additives. Moreover, 3DOM CdSQD/NC achieves an apparent quantum efficiency of 2.9% at 450 nm. Mechanism studies indicate that the 3D ordered macropores in the NC matrix are beneficial to the transfer of photogenerated carriers. Furthermore, the highly dispersed CdS QDs on the NC skeleton are able to significantly promote the adsorption of both CO2 and amine molecules and depress the CO2 activation energy barriers by stabilizing the *COOH intermediate, directly contributing to the high activity.

         <title>Significant Improvements in Dielectric Constant and Energy Density of Ferroelectric Polymer Nanocomposites Enabled by Ultralow Contents of Nanofillers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dielectric polymer nanocomposites with ultralow filler loadings exhibit considerably improved dielectric constant and breakdown strength, giving rise to remarkable discharged energy densities. A mathematical model is established to predict the dielectric constant of composites with low filler contents, revealing the significant contribution of the interphase to the polarization.








Abstract
Polymer dielectrics with excellent processability and high breakdown strength (Eb) enable the development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density capacitors. Although the improvement of dielectric constant (K) of polymer dielectric has been realized by adding high&#8208;K inorganic fillers with high contents (&gt;10 vol%), this approach faces significant challenges in scalable film processing. Here, the incorporation of ultralow ratios (&lt;1 vol%) of low&#8208;K Cd1&#8722;xZnxSe1&#8722;ySy nanodots into a ferroelectric polymer is reported. The polymer composites exhibit substantial and concurrent increase in both K and Eb, yielding a discharged energy density of 26.0 J cm&#8722;3, outperforming the current dielectric polymers and nanocomposites measured at &#8804;600 MV m&#8722;1. The observed unconventional dielectric enhancement is attributed to the structural changes induced by the nanodot fillers, including transformation of polymer chain conformation and induced interfacial dipoles, which have been confirmed by density function theory calculations. The dielectric model established in this work addresses the limitations of the current volume&#8208;average models on the polymer composites with low filler contents and gives excellent agreement to the experimental results. This work provides a new experimental route to scalable high&#8208;energy&#8208;density polymer dielectrics and also advances the fundamental understanding of the dielectric behavior of polymer nanocomposites at atomistic scales.

         <title>New Structure Mass Tag based on Zr&#8208;NMOF for Multiparameter and Sensitive Single&#8208;Cell Interrogating in Mass Cytometry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high specificity and sensitivity of a Zr mass tag in concert with the exploitation of four additional detection channels compatible with MCP_Abs indicates a great promise for developing nanoscale metal&#8211;organic&#8208;framework&#8208;based mass tags as next&#8208;generation molecular probes in CyTOF for multiparameter and sensitive single&#8208;cell biomarker interrogating.








Abstract
Mass cytometry, also called cytometry by time&#8208;of&#8208;flight (CyTOF), is an emerging powerful proteomic analysis technique that utilizes metal chelated polymer (MCP) as mass tags for interrogating high&#8208;dimensional biomarkers simultaneously on millions of individual cells.

Compared to the MCP mass tag, the Zr&#8208;mass tag provides an additional fivefold signal amplification.

&lt;p&gt;The high specificity and sensitivity of a Zr mass tag in concert with the exploitation of four additional detection channels compatible with MCP_Abs indicates a great promise for developing nanoscale metal&#8211;organic-framework-based mass tags as next-generation molecular probes in CyTOF for multiparameter and sensitive single-cell biomarker interrogating.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mass cytometry, also called cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF), is an emerging powerful proteomic analysis technique that utilizes metal chelated polymer (MCP) as mass tags for interrogating high-dimensional biomarkers simultaneously on millions of individual cells. However, under the typical polymer-based mass tag system, the sensitivity and multiplexing detection ability has been highly restricted. Herein, a new structure mass tag based on a nanometal organic framework (NMOF) is reported for multiparameter and sensitive single-cell biomarker interrogating in CyTOF. A uniform-sized Zr-NMOF (33 nm)&#160;carrying 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; metal ions is synthesized under modulator/reaction time coregulation, which is monodispersed and colloidally stable in water for over one-year storage. On functionalization with an antibody, the Zr mass tag exhibits specific molecular recognition properties and minimal cross-reaction toward nontargeted cells. In addition, the Zr-mass tag is compatible with MCP mass tags in a multiparameter assay for mouse spleen cells staining, which exploits four additional channels, &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;&#160;= 90, 91, 92, 94, for single-cell immunoassays in CyTOF. Compared to the MCP mass tag, the Zr-mass tag provides an additional fivefold signal amplification. This work provides the fundamental technical capability for exploiting NMOF-based mass tags for CyTOF application, which opens up possibility of high-dimensional single-cell immune profiling, low abundant antigen detection, and development of new barcoding systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Accelerating Ion Dynamics Under Cryogenic Conditions by the Amorphization of Crystalline Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amorphization is an effective strategy to promote low&#8208;temperature dynamics of cathodes by promoting fast charge transfer at the electrolyte&#8211;electrode interface and relieving the blocking effect of dense lattice structure on ion transport under cryogenic conditions. The synthesized amorphous organic electrode exhibits an unprecedented specific capacity of 141 mAh g&#8722;1 at an ultralow temperature of &#8722;80&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
The normal operation of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) at ultralow temperature (&lt;&#8722;40&#160;&#176;C) is significant for cold&#8208;climate applications; however, their operation is plagued by the low capacity of the conventional intercalation cathodes due to their sluggish kinetics and the slow solid diffusion of Li+ in their frameworks. Here, it is demonstrated that amorphization is an effective strategy to promote the low&#8208;temperature dynamics of cathodes by relieving the blocking effect of a dense lattice structure on ion transport under cryogenic conditions. As a result, due to the decreased charge transport impedance and enhanced Li+ diffusion rate, the obtained covalent amorphous polymer (CAP) with an abundance of pyrazine and carbonyl active sites displays a remarkably outstanding specific capacity of 141 mAh g&#8722;1 at &#8722;80&#160;&#176;C, which is superior to its structural analog, a covalent crystalline polymer (43.8 mAh g&#8722;1). Furthermore, 84.7% of the initial capacity of the CAP can be retained after 500 cycles of charge and discharge at &#8722;60&#160;&#176;C. Molecular dynamic simulations show that the channel&#8208;rich amorphous structure is highly conducive for lithium ions to diffuse quickly in the interstitial space of organic solids. This work provides an effective strategy regarding the amorphization of crystalline cathodes to develop low&#8208;temperature (Low&#8208;T) batteries.

         <title>Rapid Capture of Cancer Extracellular Vesicles by Lipid Patch Microarrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extracellular vesicles have great prospects as diagnostic and therapeutic tools. However, their isolation still poses challenges. A novel supported lipid&#8208;membrane&#8208;based platform is introduced for rapid capture, with high specificity and sensitivity, only a small needed analyte volume, and without additional purification steps. The platform is flexible and can be applied to many targets by corresponding antibodies.








Abstract
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) contain various bioactive molecules such as DNA, RNA, and proteins, and play a key role in the regulation of cancer progression. Furthermore, cancer&#8208;associated EVs carry specific biomarkers and can be used in liquid biopsy for cancer detection. However, it is still technically challenging and time consuming to detect or isolate cancer&#8208;associated EVs from complex biofluids (e.g., blood). Here, a novel EV&#8208;capture strategy based on dip&#8208;pen nanolithography generated microarrays of supported lipid membranes is presented. These arrays carry specific antibodies recognizing EV&#8208; and cancer&#8208;specific surface biomarkers, enabling highly selective and efficient capture. Importantly, it is shown that the nucleic acid cargo of captured EVs is retained on the lipid array, providing the potential for downstream analysis. Finally, the feasibility of EV capture from patient sera is demonstrated. The demonstrated platform offers rapid capture, high specificity, and sensitivity, with only a small need in analyte volume and without additional purification steps. The platform is applied in context of cancer&#8208;associated EVs, but it can easily be adapted to other diagnostic EV targets by use of corresponding antibodies.

         <title>Large&#8208;Area Vertically Aligned Bismuthene Nanosheet Arrays from Galvanic Replacement Reaction for Efficient Electrochemical CO2 Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large&#8208;area vertically aligned bismuthene nanosheet arrays are demonstrated to grow on various Cu substrates via the galvanic replacement reaction. They feature small nanosheet thickness, large surface areas, and abundant porosity between the nanosheets, and can enable efficient and robust CO2 reduction to formate in aqueous solution.








Abstract
There is a lack of straightforward methods to prepare high&#8208;quality bismuthene nanosheets, or, even more challengingly, to grow their arrays due to the low melting point and high oxophilicity of bismuth. This synthetic obstacle has hindered their potential applications. In this work, it is demonstrated that the galvanic replacement reaction can do the trick. Under well&#8208;controlled conditions, large&#8208;area vertically aligned bismuthene nanosheet arrays are grown on Cu substrates of various shapes and sizes. The product features small nanosheet thickness of two to three atomic layers, large surface areas, and abundant porosity between nanosheets. Most remarkably, bismuthene nanosheet arrays grown on Cu foam can enable efficient CO2 reduction to formate with high Faradaic efficiency of &gt;90%, large current density of 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, and great stability.

         <title>Zero&#8208;Valent Palladium Single&#8208;Atoms Catalysts Confined in Black Phosphorus for Efficient Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zero&#8208;valent palladium single&#8208;atoms catalysts confined in black phosphorus are successfully synthesized via atomic layer deposition (ALD). This BP&#8208;based SAC with metallic Pd1/P shows a highly selective semi&#8208;hydrogenation of phenylacetylene toward styrene, opening up new avenues for designing zero&#8208;valent SACs on BP for a wide range of organic transformations.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) represent a new frontier in heterogeneous catalysis due to their remarkable catalytic properties and maximized atomic utilization. However, single atoms often bond to the support with polarized electron density and thus exhibit a high valence state, limiting their catalytic scopes in many chemical transformations. Here, it is demonstrated that 2D black phosphorus (BP) acts as giant phosphorus (P) ligand to confine a high density of single atoms (e.g., Pd1, Pt1) via atomic layer deposition. Unlike other 2D materials, BP with relatively low electronegativity and buckled structure favors the strong confinement of robust zero&#8208;valent palladium SACs in the vacancy site. Metallic Pd1/BP SAC shows a highly selective semi&#8208;hydrogenation of phenylacetylene toward styrene, distinct from metallic Pd nanoparticles that facilitate the formation of fully hydrogenated products. Density functional theory calculations reveal that Pd atom forms covalent&#8208;like bonding with adjacent P atoms, wherein H atoms tend to adsorb, aiding the dissociative adsorption of H2. Zero&#8208;valent Pd in the confined space favors a larger energy gain for the synthesis of partially hydrogenated product over the fully hydrogenated one. This work provides a new route toward the synthesis of zero&#8208;valent SACs on BP for organic transformations.

         <title>Triarylamine&#8208;Pyridine&#8208;Carbonitriles for Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Devices with EQE Nearly 40%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three 2,6&#8208;diphenylpyridine&#8208;3,5&#8208;dicarbonitrile&#8208;based compounds with excellent photoluminescent quantum yields (79&#8211;100%) and high horizontal dipole ratios (86&#8722;88%) in the thin films are demonstrated. With two methyl groups on the triarylamines, the spin&#8722;orbit coupling is enhanced due to the elevated locally excited triplet states (3LE), leading to a fast reverse intersystem crossing. Green thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on them exhibit a record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency of 39.8% without any optical extraction technique.








Abstract
Highly efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules are in urgent demand for solid&#8208;state lighting and full&#8208;color displays. Here, the design and synthesis of three triarylamine&#8208;pyridine&#8208;carbonitrile&#8208;based TADF compounds, TPAPPC, TPAmPPC, and tTPAmPPC, are shown. They exhibit excellent photoluminescence quantum yields of 79&#8722;100% with small &#916;EST values, fast reverse intersystem crossing (RISC), and high horizontal dipole ratios (&#920;//&#160;= 86&#8722;88%) in the thin films leading to the enhancement of device light outcoupling. Consequently, a green organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) based on TPAmPPC shows a high average external quantum efficiency of 38.8&#160;&#177; 0.6%, a current efficiency of 130.1&#160;&#177; 2.1&#160;cd A&#8211;1, and a power efficiency of 136.3&#160;&#177; 2.2&#160;lm W&#8211;1. The highest device efficiency of 39.8% appears to be record&#8208;breaking among TADF&#8208;based OLEDs to date. In addition, the TPAmPPC&#8208;based device shows superior operation lifetime and high&#8208;temperature resistance. It is worth noting that the TPA&#8208;PPC&#8208;based materials have excellent optical properties and the potential for making them strong candidates for TADF practical application.

         <title>A New Class of Chiral Nematic Phase with Helical Polar Order</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of chiral liquid&#8208;crystal phase, the polar cholesteric phase, is realized. In addition to the unique dielectric property succeeded from the polar nematic host, the polar cholesteric phase is distinct from the conventional cholesteric phase due to the non&#8208;degeneracy of the local nematic director, as observed in the fundamental optical behaviors in wedge&#8208;cells or under E&#8208;fields.








Abstract
A novel chiral nematic phase with a polar helical order is realized via the introduction of helical twisting power into a polar nematogen. The properties of the induced polar nematic (polar cholesteric: Np*) phase differ from those of the conventional cholesteric (N*) phases existing thus far. Np*, which is a new class of N* structures, is characterized not only by its helically twisted nematic director, but also by a continuously twisted polarization. Transmission spectroscopy and helical pitch measurements in a wedge cell revealed that the half&#8208;helical pitch in the Np* phase vanished because of the polar response in the Np* helix. The inner polar director in the Np* phase is confirmed in dielectric and second&#8208;harmonic&#8208;generation studies. Furthermore, this unique Np*LC, which corresponds to a half&#8208;/full&#8208;pitch helix, enables ultrafast electro&#8208;optic switching (&#964;&#160;&lt;&#160;20&#160;&#181;s), and proposes new potential applications for electrically interchangeable photonic bandgaps.

         <title>The Manufacture of Unbreakable Bionics via Multifunctional and Self&#8208;Healing Silk&#8211;Graphene Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomaterials that transmit electricity like the human body can open new opportunities. For seamless mirroring of our&#160;anatomy, they also need to conform to its curvilinear architecture, and display self&#8208;healing ability like native organs and tissues. To address this, a conductive, adhesive, reconfigurable, and viscoelastic gum (CareGum), with promising applications in cyborganics, bionics, and soft robotics, is developed.








Abstract
Biomaterials capable of transmitting signals over longer distances than those in rigid electronics can open new opportunities for humanity by mimicking the way tissues propagate information. For seamless mirroring of the human body, they also have to display conformability to its curvilinear architecture, as well as, reproducing native&#8208;like mechanical and electrical properties combined with the ability to self&#8208;heal on demand like native organs and tissues. Along these lines, a multifunctional composite is developed by mixing silk fibroin and reduced graphene oxide. The material is coined &#8220;CareGum&#8221; and capitalizes on a phenolic glue to facilitate sacrificial and hierarchical hydrogen bonds. The hierarchal bonding scheme gives rise to high mechanical toughness, record&#8208;breaking elongation capacity of &#8776;25 000%, excellent conformability to arbitrary and complex surfaces, 3D printability, a tenfold increase in electrical conductivity, and a fourfold increase in Young's modulus compared to its pristine counterpart. By taking advantage of these unique properties, a durable and self&#8208;healing bionic glove is developed for hand gesture sensing and sign translation. Indeed, CareGum is a new advanced material with promising applications in fields like cyborganics, bionics, soft robotics, human&#8211;machine interfaces, 3D&#8208;printed electronics, and flexible bioelectronics.

         <title>Chiral Helimagnetism and One&#8208;Dimensional Magnetic Solitons in a Cr&#8208;Intercalated Transition Metal Dichalcogenide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral helimagnetism and 1D magnetic solitons are discovered in Cr&#8208;intercalated 2H&#8208;TaS2. The chiral helimagnetic structure has an initial period of &#8776;25&#160;nm, and it transforms into a chiral soliton lattice in an external magnetic field. The spatial period evolution of this topological spin texture obeys the chiral sine&#8208;Gordon theory, revealing great potential for fast&#8208;speed racetrack memories.








Abstract
Chiral magnets endowed with topological spin textures are expected to have promising applications in next&#8208;generation magnetic memories. In contrast to the well&#8208;studied 2D or 3D magnetic skyrmions, the authors report the discovery of 1D nontrivial magnetic solitons in a transition metal dichalcogenide 2H&#8208;TaS2 via precise intercalation of Cr elements. In the synthetic Cr1/3TaS2 (CTS) single crystal, the coupling of the strong spin&#8211;orbit interaction from TaS2 and the chiral arrangement of the magnetic Cr ions evoke a robust Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction. A magnetic helix having a short spatial period of &#8776;25&#160;nm is observed in CTS via Lorentz transmission electron microscopy. In a magnetic field perpendicular to the helical axis, the helical spin structure transforms into a chiral soliton lattice (CSL) with the spin structure evolution being consistent with the chiral sine&#8208;Gordon theory, which opens promising perspectives for the application of CSL to fast&#8208;speed nonvolatile magnetic memories. This work introduces a new paradigm to soliton physics and provides an effective strategy for seeking novel 2D magnets.

         <title>Penta&#8208;PdPSe: A New 2D Pentagonal Material with Highly In&#8208;Plane Optical, Electronic, and Optoelectronic Anisotropy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new 2D pentagonal material, penta&#8208;PdPSe, with low&#8208;symmetry lattice characteristics, is introduced to the 2D family. Such a low&#8208;symmetry structure endows this material with strong in&#8208;plane anisotropy, in which high conductance and photoresponsivity anisotropic ratios of 4.74 and 6.17 are achieved, respectively. These results make 2D penta&#8208;PdPSe an ideal material for the design of next&#8208;generation anisotropic devices.








Abstract
Due to their low&#8208;symmetry lattice characteristics and intrinsic in&#8208;plane anisotropy, 2D pentagonal materials, a new class of 2D materials composed entirely of pentagonal atomic rings, are attracting increasing research attention. However, the existence of these 2D materials has not been proven experimentally until the recent discovery of PdSe2. Herein, penta&#8208;PdPSe, a new 2D pentagonal material with a novel low&#8208;symmetry puckered pentagonal structure, is introduced to the 2D family. Interestingly, a peculiar polyanion of [Se&#63743;P&#63743;P&#63743;Se]4&#8722; is discovered in this material, which is the biggest polyanion in 2D materials yet discovered. Strong intrinsic in&#8208;plane anisotropic behavior endows penta&#8208;PdPSe with highly anisotropic optical, electronic, and optoelectronic properties. Impressively, few&#8208;layer penta&#8208;PdPSe&#8208;based phototransistor not only achieves excellent electronic performances, a moderate electron mobility of 21.37 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and a high on/off ratio of up to 108, but it also has a high photoresponsivity of &#8776;5.07&#160;&#215; 103 A W&#8722;1 at 635&#160;nm, which is ascribed to the photogating effect. More importantly, penta&#8208;PdPSe also exhibits a large anisotropic conductance (&#963;max/&#963;max&#160;= 3.85) and responsivity (Rmax/Rmin&#160;= 6.17 at 808&#160;nm), superior to most 2D anisotropic materials. These findings make penta&#8208;PdPSe an ideal material for the design of next&#8208;generation anisotropic devices.

         <title>Mussel&#8208;Inspired Design of a Self&#8208;Adhesive Agent for Durable Moisture Management and Bacterial Inhibition on PET Fabric</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mussel&#8208;inspired hydrophilic agent based on the cation&#8211;&#960; interaction is developed with strong self&#8208;adhesion on poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) fabric to form a durable superhydrophilic and antibacterial coating. It shows great potential in designing a Janus PET fabric for efficient sweat/heat management and bacterial inhibition without interfering the balance of the skin microflora, which is highly valued in physiological health and long&#8208;term wearing.








Abstract
Functional textiles with advanced moisture management can enhance human comfort and physiological health. However, conventional wet finishing processes used for textiles are usually highly polluting and exhibit poor fastness. Inspired by the strong underwater adhesion properties of mussels based on cation&#8211;&#960; interaction, a novel superhydrophilic polymeric molecule with strong cohesion and adhesion property is designed on a poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) fabric. The cation&#8211;&#960; hydrophilic agent (CPHA) can efficiently transform the hydrophobic PET fabric to a superhydrophilic one, and its superhydrophilicity can withstand 150 home laundry cycles. In addition, the cationic moieties in the CPHA self&#8208;adhere to the PET fabric without any finishing auxiliary that would cause pollution. Due to its strong adhesion, CPHA can be applied to one side of the PET fabric via spray coating and curing to form a Janus hydrophobic/superhydrophilic fabric capable of diode&#8208;like one&#8208;way sweat transportation (with forward transportation capability of 1115% and backward transportation capability of &#8722;1509%). Moreover, the Janus fabric inhibits bacterial growth and invasion, while simultaneously preserving the inner ecological healthy balance of the skin's microflora. This work opens up a pathway to develop adhesives in textile wet processing for more diverse, smarter applications, e.g., quick&#8208;dry sportswear, protective suits, or air&#8208;conditioning fabrics.

         <title>Facile Production of Phosphorene Nanoribbons towards Application in Lithium Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphorene nanoribbons (PNRs) are prepared by a facile electrochemical exfoliation with a high yield of &gt;80%. The PNR film acts as a protective layer on a lithium&#8208;metal anode to form a Li+&#8208;ion&#8208;conducting Li3P interface that enables long&#8208;time cycling stability of lithium&#8208;metal batteries.








Abstract
Like phosphorene, phosphorene nanoribbon (PNR) promises exotic properties but unzipping phosphorene into edge&#8208;defined PNR is non&#8208;trivial because of uncontrolled cutting of phosphorene along random directions. Here a facile electrochemical strategy to fabricate zigzag&#8208;edged PNRs in high yield (&gt;80%) is reported. The presence of chemically active zigzag edges in PNR allows it to spontaneously react with Li to form a Li+ ion conducting Li3P phase, which can be used as a protective layer on Li metal anode in lithium metal batteries (LMBs). PNR protective layer prevents the parasitic reaction between lithium metal and electrolyte and promotes Li+ ion diffusion kinetics, enabling homogenous Li+ ion flux and long&#8208;time cycling stability up to 1100&#160;h at a current density of 1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. LiFePO4|PNR&#8208;Li full&#8208;cell batteries with an areal capacity of 2&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2, a lean electrolyte (20&#160;&#181;l&#160;mAh&#8722;1) and a negative/positive (N/P) electrodes ratio of 3.5 can be stably cycled over 100 cycles.

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Hydrogels for Rapid Water Disinfection and Sustainable Solar Vapor Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antibacterial hydrogels (ABHs) are designed as tablets for rapid water disinfection (&gt;99.999%) and can be easily removed from water without leaving chemical impurities. With excellent photothermal and biofouling&#8208;resistant properties, ABHs can also be functional in solar water&#8208;purification technologies to enable stable distillate production after months of storage and operation in bacteria&#8208;containing river water. 








Abstract
Consumption of unsafe water is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in developing regions. Pasteurizing or boiling water to remove pathogens is energy&#8208;intensive and often impractical to off&#8208;grid communities. Therefore, low capital cost, rapid and energy&#8208;efficient water disinfection methods are urgently required to address global challenges of safe water access. Here, anti&#8208;bacterial hydrogels (ABHs) with catechol&#8208;enabled molecular&#8208;level hydrogen peroxide generators and quinone&#8208;anchored activated carbon particles are designed for effective water treatment. The bactericidal effect is attributed to the synergy of hydrogen peroxide and quinone groups to attack essential cell components and disturb bacterial metabolism. ABHs can be directly used as tablets to achieve &gt;99.999% water disinfection efficiency within 60&#160;min without energy input. No harmful byproducts are formed during the treatment process, after which the ABH tablets can be easily removed without residues. Taking advantage of their excellent photothermal and biofouling&#8208;resistant properties, ABHs can also be applied as solar evaporators to achieve stable water purification under sunlight (&#8804;1&#160;kW m&#8722;2) after months of storage and operation in bacteria&#8208;containing river water. The ABH platform offers reduced energy and chemical demands for point&#8208;of&#8208;use water treatment technologies in remote areas and emergency rescue applications.

         <title>Comment on &#8220;Eppur si Muove: Proton Diffusion in Halide Perovskite Single Crystals&#8221;: Eppur Non si Muove: A Critical Evaluation of Proton Diffusion in Halide Perovskite Single Crystals</title>

The &gt;105 discrepancy between recent reports of proton diffusion constants in halide perovskites is analyzed and it is found that the lower value is likely correct. The higher diffusion rate determined from single crystals may be the result of high&#8208;diffusivity pathways.








Abstract
A recent report by Cahen and co&#8208;workers is examined that finds the diffusion constant for proton migration in methylammonium lead triiodide single crystals to be 2 &#215; 105&#8208;fold greater than that previously reported by Sadhu et&#160;al. By comparing the conversion of single crystals versus microcrystalline samples, it is concluded that proton diffusion in macroscopic single crystals is accelerated by the presence of defects acting as high&#8208;diffusivity paths.

         <title>Response to Comment on &#8220;Eppur si Muove: Proton Diffusion in Halide Perovskite Single Crystals&#8221;: Measure What is Measurable, and Make Measurable What is Not So: Discrepancies between Proton Diffusion in Halide Perovskite Single Crystals and Thin Films</title>

What can explain the 105 times difference higher value of the proton diffusion coefficient in iodide perovskite single crystals relative to other reported values in thin films? Instead of migration through imperfections, which is shown to be highly improbable, experimentally testable alternatives are proposed.








Abstract
Buffeteau et&#160;al. note that the proton diffusion coefficient in MAPbI3 that is deduced (by the authors) from results, obtained by a suite of complementary techniques, on a large number of single crystals (Adv. Mater. 2020, 32, 2002467) is 5 orders of magnitude higher than what is estimated (by them) in J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2020, 142, 10431, from infrared spectroscopy on ultrathin MAPbI3 films; use of (deuterium/hydrogen) D/H isotope substitution is common to both studies. Buffeteau et&#160;al. speculated that proton diffusion in halide perovskite single crystals is dominated by 1D defects, which will somehow not be present in thin films, as those are made up of small&#8208;sized crystallites. It is shown here that the idea of a 1D defect is not supported by the body of experimental data gathered on these crystals, that the statistical analysis employed in to Buffeteau et&#160;al. to support the criticism is problematic, and it is concluded that the source of the difference must lie elsewhere. Constructive suggestions for this difference are provided and experiments to discern between possible reasons for it are proposed.

Perovskite Photodetectors
In article number 2101714, Wei Tian, Liang Li, and co&#8208;workers report a practical method to adjust the phase distribution in 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskites to construct efficient and stable perovskite photodetectors. The ordered arrangement of phase compositions facilitates the separation and transportation of photogenerated charge carriers, and endows the device with improved performance and environmental stability.

Microbatteries
The proliferation and performance of physically small electronics have been severely limited by the microbatteries that power them. In article number 2101760, John B. Cook, Paul V. Braun, James H. Pikul, and co&#8208;workers report a new design paradigm for primary microbatteries that drastically improves energy and power density through the use of thick and near&#8208;fully dense electrodeposited cathodes and multifunctional current collectors that eliminate most of the hermetic packaging.

The history of biomaterials began with naturally derived materials such as nacre and animal tissues. Gradually mankind developed more advanced materials such as metals, ceramics, alloys and polymers to yield prosthetics and implants. Flexible and reconfigurable materials such as &#8220;CareGum&#8221; are slowly changing the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art by yielding flexible human&#8211;machine interfaces (e.g., bionic eyes, brain implants, heart patches, and bionic wearables (like the electronic glove developed by Alireza Dolatshahi&#8208;Pirouz in article number 2100047)).

         <title>A New Class of Chiral Nematic Phase with Helical Polar Order (Adv. Mater. 35/2021)</title>

Liquid Crystals
A new class of cholesteric phase with local polar order is realized by Fumito Araoka and Hiroya Nishikawa in article number 2101305. In general, the periodicity of the conventional cholesteric liquid crystal corresponds to the half&#8208;pitch of the helix, having head&#8208;and&#8208;tail symmetry in the local nematic director. On the other hand, the newly found polar cholesteric liquid crystal is characterized with a full&#8208;pitch periodicity of the helix due to the polar degeneracy in the local nematic director. This delivers some unprecedented properties, such as fast electro&#8208;optic response based on the photonic band modulated with polar helix deformation.

         <title>Materials with Electroprogrammable Stiffness</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel applications, such as soft robotics and haptics, require emerging material systems whose stiffness can be selectively programmed using an electrical input to increase performance and simplify designs. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art materials with electroprogrammable stiffness are reviewed, categorizing them into those governed by electrostatics and phase&#8208;changes, and identifying challenges and opportunities toward the next generation of stimuli&#8208;responsive materials.








Abstract
Stiffness is a mechanical property of vital importance to any material system and is typically considered a static quantity. Recent work, however, has shown that novel materials with programmable stiffness can enhance the performance and simplify the design of engineered systems, such as morphing wings, robotic grippers, and wearable exoskeletons. For many of these applications, the ability to program stiffness with electrical activation is advantageous because of the natural compatibility with electrical sensing, control, and power networks ubiquitous in autonomous machines and robots. The numerous applications for materials with electrically driven stiffness modulation has driven a rapid increase in the number of publications in this field. Here, a comprehensive review of the available materials that realize electroprogrammable stiffness is provided, showing that all current approaches can be categorized as using electrostatics or electrically activated phase changes, and summarizing the advantages, limitations, and applications of these materials. Finally, a perspective identifies state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art trends and an outlook of future opportunities for the development and use of materials with electroprogrammable stiffness.

Respiration carries a wealth of physiologically relevant information as well as clues to potential diseases. An overview of TENG&#8208;enabled self&#8208;powered respiration monitoring, with a focus on the working principle, sensing materials, functional structures, and related applications in both physical respiration motion monitoring and chemical breath analysis, is presented.








Abstract
In mammals, physiological respiration involves respiratory cycles of inhaled and exhaled breaths, which has traditionally been an underutilized resource potentially encompassing a wealth of physiologically relevant information as well as clues to potential diseases. Recently, triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have been widely adopted for self&#8208;powered respiration monitoring owing to their compelling features, such as decent biocompatibility, wearing comfort, low&#8208;cost, and high sensitivity to respiration activities in the aspect of low frequency and slight amplitude body motions. Physiological respiration behaviors and exhaled chemical regents can be precisely and continuously monitored by TENG&#8208;based respiration sensors for personalized health care. This article presents an overview of TENG enabled self&#8208;powered respiration monitoring, with a focus on the working principle, sensing materials, functional structures, and related applications in both physical respiration motion detection and chemical breath analysis. Concepts and approaches for acquisition of physical information associated with respiratory rate and depth are covered in the first part. Then the sensing mechanism, theoretical modeling, and applications related to detection of chemicals released from breathing gases are systemically summarized. Finally, the opportunities and challenges of triboelectric effect enabled self&#8208;powered respiration monitoring are comprehensively discussed and criticized.

Abstract
The rapid advances in the Internet of things and wearable devices have created a massive platform for sensor systems that detect chemical or biological agents. The accelerated development of these devices in recent years has simultaneously aggravated the power supply problems. Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) represent a thriving renewable energy technology with the potential to revolutionize this field. In this review, the significance of TENG&#8208;based sensor systems in chemical or biological detection from the perspective of the development of power supply for biochemical sensors is discussed. Further, a range of TENGs are classified according to their roles as power supplies and/or self&#8208;powered active sensors. The TENG powered sensor systems are further discussed on the basis of their framework and applications. The working principles and structures of different TENG&#8208;based self&#8208;powered active sensors are presented, along with the classification of the sensors based on these factors. In addition, some representative applications are introduced, and the corresponding challenges are discussed. Finally, some perspectives for the future innovations of TENG&#8208;based sensor systems for chemical/biological detection are discussed.

         <title>Ultrafast Electron Tunneling Devices&#8212;From Electric&#8208;Field Driven to Optical&#8208;Field Driven</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrafast electron tunneling devices are summarized. Compared to conventional semiconductor&#8208;based electron transport devices, electron tunneling devices can provide, significantly, much faster response time due to near&#8208;instantaneous tunneling that occurs on femtosecond timescales. The central tenet of optical&#8208;field&#8208;driven tunneling devices is realizing sub&#8208;optical&#8208;cycle response lightwave electronics.








Abstract
The search for ever higher frequency information processing has become an area of intense research activity within the micro, nano, and optoelectronics communities. Compared to conventional semiconductor&#8208;based diffusive transport electron devices, electron tunneling devices provide significantly faster response times due to near&#8208;instantaneous tunneling that occurs at sub&#8208;femtosecond timescales. As a result, the enhanced performance of electron tunneling devices is demonstrated, time and again, to reimagine a wide variety of traditional electronic devices with a variety of new &#8220;lightwave electronics&#8221; emerging, each capable of reducing the electron transport channel transit time down to attosecond timescales. In response to unprecedented rapid progress within this field, here the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in electron tunneling devices is reviewed, current challenges and opportunities are highlighted, and possible future research directions are identified.

         <title>Energy Autonomous Sweat&#8208;Based Wearable Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sweat&#8208;based energy harvesting and storage devices, along with the key components of sweat&#8208;based energy autonomous wearables systems are comprehensively reviewed. Various considerations such as the power management and the sweat extraction, etc., are discussed for continuous operation of sweat&#8208;based systems.








Abstract
The continuous operation of wearable electronics demands reliable sources of energy, currently met through Li&#8208;ion batteries and various energy harvesters. These solutions are being used out of necessity despite potential safety issues and unsustainable environmental impact. Safe and sustainable energy sources can boost the use of wearables systems in diverse applications such as health monitoring, prosthetics, and sports. In this regard, sweat&#8208; and sweat&#8208;equivalent&#8208;based studies have attracted tremendous attention through the demonstration of energy&#8208;generating biofuel cells, promising power densities as high as 3.5&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, storage using sweat&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;based supercapacitors with energy and power densities of 1.36&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and 329.70 W&#160;kg&#8722;1, respectively, and sweat&#8208;activated batteries with an impressive energy density of 67 Ah kg&#8722;1. A combination of these energy generating, and storage devices can lead to fully energy&#8208;autonomous wearables capable of providing sustainable power in the &#181;W to mW range, which is sufficient to operate both sensing and communication devices. Here, a comprehensive review covering these advances, addressing future challenges and potential solutions related to fully energy&#8208;autonomous wearables is presented, with emphasis on sweat&#8208;based energy storage and energy generation elements along with sweat&#8208;based sensors as applications.
