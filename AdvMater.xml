         <title>Recent Advances in Moir&#233; Superlattice Systems by Angle&#8208;Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Artificial moir&#233; superlattices have become a fertile playground for emergent quantum phenomena. Modern angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) can directly visualize electronic structures and thus can provide enlightening insights into fundamental physics in moir&#233; superlattice systems and guides for designing novel devices. Major advances in the ARPES studies of moir&#233; superlattices are reviewed and new experimental directions are discussed.








Abstract
The last decade has witnessed a flourish in 2D materials including graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) as atomic&#8208;scale Legos. Artificial moir&#233; superlattices via stacking 2D materials with a twist angle and/or a lattice mismatch have recently become a fertile playground exhibiting a plethora of emergent properties beyond their building blocks. These rich quantum phenomena stem from their nontrivial electronic structures that are effectively tuned by the moir&#233; periodicity. Modern angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) can directly visualize electronic structures with decent momentum, energy, and spatial resolution, thus can provide enlightening insights into fundamental physics in moir&#233; superlattice systems and guides for designing novel devices. In this review, first, a brief introduction is given on advanced ARPES techniques and basic ideas of band structures in a moir&#233; superlattice system. Then ARPES research results of various moir&#233; superlattice systems are highlighted, including graphene on substrates with small lattice mismatches, twisted graphene/TMD moir&#233; systems, and high&#8208;order moir&#233; superlattice systems. Finally, it discusses important questions that remain open, challenges in current experimental investigations, and presents an outlook on this field of research.

         <title>Challenges and Advances in Rechargeable Batteries for Extreme&#8208;Condition Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rechargeable batteries have been widely used in the daily life, but their applications are largely compromised under extreme environments due to various failure mechanisms. This review focuses on the mechanistic understanding of the key challenges that limit the battery performance, and highlights recent new concepts and approaches to address these critical challenges under different extreme conditions.








Abstract
Rechargeable batteries are widely used as power sources for portable electronics, electric vehicles and smart grids. Their practical performances are, however, largely undermined under extreme conditions, such as in high&#8208;altitude drones, ocean exploration and polar expedition. These extreme environmental conditions not only bring new challenges for batteries but also incur unique battery failure mechanisms. To fill in the gap, it is of great importance to understand the battery failure mechanisms under different extreme conditions and figure out the key parameters that limit battery performances. In this review, the authors start by investigating the key challenges from the viewpoints of ionic/charge transfer, material/interface evolution and electrolyte degradation under different extreme conditions. This is followed by different engineering approaches through electrode materials design, electrolyte modification and battery component optimization to enhance practical battery performances. Finally, a short perspective is provided about the future development of rechargeable batteries under extreme conditions.

         <title>Advancements in Microwave Absorption Motivated by Interdisciplinary Research</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review traces microwave absorption materials (MAMs) from initial coatings to functional absorbers, summarizes the bottlenecks, and proposes potential solutions like mechanism exploration, material development, novel tool application, and lab&#8208;user proximity. It also details impactful MAMs applications in interdisciplinary fields, highlighting their development status and prospects. This marks the next smart absorber era, driving future MW use.








Abstract
Microwave absorption materials (MAMs) are originally developed for military purposes, but have since evolved into versatile materials with promising applications in modern technologies, including household use. Despite significant progress in bench&#8208;side research over the past decade, MAMs remain limited in their scope and have yet to be widely adopted. This review explores the history of MAMs from first&#8208;generation coatings to second&#8208;generation functional absorbers, identifies bottlenecks hindering their maturation. It also presents potential solutions such as exploring broader spatial scales, advanced characterization, introducing liquid media, utilizing novel toolbox (machine learning, ML), and proximity of lab to end&#8208;user. Additionally, it meticulously presents compelling applications of MAMs in medicine, mechanics, energy, optics, and sensing, which go beyond absorption efficiency, along with their current development status and prospects. This interdisciplinary research direction differs from previous research which primarily focused on meeting traditional requirements (i.e., thin, lightweight, wide, and strong), and can be defined as the next generation of smart absorbers. Ultimately, the effective utilization of ubiquitous electromagnetic (EM) waves, aided by third&#8208;generation MAMs, should be better aligned with future expectations.

         <title>Fabrication of Oriented Polycrystalline MOF Superstructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have progressed beyond powdery and single&#8208;crystalline materials towards polycrystalline superstructures. A current challenge is&#160;the fabrication of superstructures with defined crystalline orientation to access anisotropic properties. This perspective examines methods for the fabrication of oriented MOF superstructures (colloidal assembly, external fields, heteroepitaxial ceramic&#8208;to&#8208;MOF, and other emerging methods), to promote the development of systems with oriented pore channels.








Abstract
The field of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) has progressed beyond the design and exploration of powdery and single&#8208;crystalline materials. A current challenge is the fabrication of organized superstructures that can harness the directional properties of the individual constituent MOF crystals. To date, the progress in the fabrication methods of polycrystalline MOF superstructures has led to close&#8208;packed structures with defined crystalline orientation. By controlling the crystalline orientation, the MOF pore channels of the constituent crystals can be aligned along specific directions: these systems possess anisotropic properties including enhanced diffusion along specific directions, preferential orientation of guest species, and protection of functional guests. In this perspective, we&#160;discuss the current status of MOF research in the fabrication of oriented polycrystalline superstructures focusing on the specific crystalline directions of orientation. Three methods are examined in detail: the assembly from colloidal MOF solutions, the use of external fields for the alignment of MOF particles, and the heteroepitaxial ceramic&#8208;to&#8208;MOF growth. This perspective aims at promoting the progress of this field of research and inspiring the development of new protocols for the preparation of MOF systems with oriented pore channels, to enable advanced MOF&#8208;based devices with anisotropic properties.

         <title>Machine Learning Paves the Way for High Entropy Compounds Exploration: Challenges, Progress, and Outlook</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine learning (ML) revolutionizes high entropy compounds (HECs) research, addressing their complex structures. It models HEC at atomic and macroscopic levels, using various algorithms. Accurate data, feature engineering, and cross&#8208;validation are key for robust models. ML's potential in HEC exploration is significant, driving Artificial&#8208;intelliegence&#8208;assisted material discovery.








Abstract
Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool in the research field of high entropy compounds (HECs), which have gained worldwide attention due to their vast compositional space and abundant regulatability. However, the complex structure space of HEC poses challenges to traditional experimental and computational approaches, necessitating the adoption of machine learning. Microscopically, machine learning can model the Hamiltonian of the HEC system, enabling atomic&#8208;level property investigations, while macroscopically, it can analyze macroscopic material characteristics such as hardness, melting point, and ductility. Various machine learning algorithms, both traditional methods and deep neural networks, can be employed in HEC research. Comprehensive and accurate data collection, feature engineering, and model training and selection through cross&#8208;validation are crucial for establishing excellent ML models. ML also holds promise in analyzing phase structures and stability, constructing potentials in simulations, and facilitating the design of functional materials. Although some domains, such as magnetic and device materials, still require further exploration, machine learning's potential in HEC research is substantial. Consequently, machine learning has become an indispensable tool in understanding and exploiting the capabilities of HEC, serving as the foundation for the new paradigm of Artificial&#8208;intelligence&#8208;assisted material exploration.

         <title>Recent Advancements in Electrochemical Hydrogen Production via Hybrid Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Replacing the anodic oxygen evolution reaction with thermodynamically more favorable oxidation reactions is regarded as a promising strategy to radically reduce the energy required for H2 production from water electrolysis. Here the recent progress of some major types of alternative oxidation reactions for hybrid water splitting has been comprehensively summarized.








Abstract
As one of the most promising approaches to producing high&#8208;purity hydrogen (H2), electrochemical water splitting powered by the renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power has attracted considerable interest over the past decade. However, the water electrolysis process is seriously hampered by the sluggish electrode reaction kinetics, especially the four&#8208;electron oxygen evolution reaction at the anode side, which induces a high reaction overpotential. Currently, the emerging hybrid electrochemical water splitting strategy is proposed by integrating thermodynamically favorable electro&#8211;oxidation reactions with hydrogen evolution reaction at the cathode, providing a new opportunity for energy&#8211;efficient H2 production. To achieve highly efficient and cost&#8211;effective hybrid water splitting toward large&#8211;scale practical H2 production, much work has been continuously done to exploit the alternative anodic oxidation reactions and cutting&#8211;edge electrocatalysts. This review will focus on recent developments on electrochemical H2 production coupled with alternative oxidation reactions, including the choice of anodic substrates, the investigation on electrocatalytic materials, and the deep understanding of the underlying reaction mechanisms. Finally, some insights into the scientific challenges now standing in the way of future advancement of the hybrid water electrolysis technique are shared, in the hope of inspiring further innovative efforts in this rapidly growing field.

         <title>The Emerging Landscape for Combating Resistance Associated with Energy&#8208;Based Therapies via Nanomedicine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Energy&#8208;based therapies (ET) based on athermal and thermal ablation provide distinct advantages for cancer therapy, but the therapeutic efficiency is generally limited by the emergence of ET&#8208;associated resistance (ETR). The underlying mechanisms of ETR and representative applications of nanoplatforms applied in mitigating ETR are highlighted in this comprehensive review, aiming to facilitate future clinical translation.








Abstract
Cancer represents a serious disease with significant implications for public health, imposing substantial economic burden and negative societal consequences. Compared to conventional cancer treatments, such as surgery and chemotherapy, energy&#8208;based therapies (ET) based on athermal and thermal ablation provide distinct advantages, including minimally invasive procedures and rapid postoperative recovery. Nevertheless, due to the complex pathophysiology of many solid tumors, the therapeutic effectiveness of ET is often limited. Nanotechnology offers unique opportunities by enabling facile material designs, tunable physicochemical properties, and excellent biocompatibility, thereby further augmenting the outcomes of ET. Numerous nanomaterials have demonstrated the ability to overcome intrinsic therapeutic resistance associated with ET, leading to improved antitumor responses. This comprehensive review systematically summarizes the underlying mechanisms of ET&#8208;associated resistance (ETR) and highlights representative applications of nanoplatforms used to mitigate ETR. Overall, this review emphasizes the recent advances in the field and presents a detailed account of novel nanomaterial designs in combating ETR, along with efforts aimed at facilitating their clinical translation.

         <title>Current State and Perspectives of Exfoliated Zeolites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Layered zeolites join the class of 2D solids that can be dispersed, like graphene, by soft&#8208;chemical treatment to provide unilamellar nanosheets in solution. Aside from solving a 3&#8208;decade old challenge, this enables using zeolites for a top&#8208;down assembly of hierarchical nanocomposites with any type of nanomaterials or compound. Especially valuable benefits include preparation of oriented zeolite films.








Abstract
Zeolites are highly efficient industrial catalysts and sorbents with microporous framework structures. Approximately 10% of the frameworks, but eventually all in the long run, have produced both 3D crystals and 2D layers. The latter can be intercalated and expanded like all 2D materials but proved difficult to exfoliate directly into suspensions of monolayers in solution as precursors for unique synthetic opportunities. Successful exfoliations have been reported recently and are overviewed in this perspective article. The discussion highlights 3 primary challenges in this field, namely finding suitable 2D zeolite preparations that exfoliate directly in high yield, proving uniform layer thickness in solution and identifying applications to exploit the unique synthetic capabilities and properties of exfoliated zeolite monolayers. Four zeolites have been confirmed to exfoliate directly into monolayers: 3 with known structures&#8212;MWW, MFI, and RWR and one unknown, bifer with a unit cell close to ferrierite. The exfoliation into monolayers is confirmed by the combination of 5&#8211;6 characterization techniques including AFM, in situ and in&#8208;plane XRD, and microscopies. The promising areas of development are oriented films and membranes, intimately mixed zeolite phases, and hierarchical nanoscale composites with other active species like nanoparticles and clusters that are unfeasible by solid state processes.

         <title>Designing Hydrogels for Immunomodulation in Cancer Therapy and Regenerative Medicine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Targeting immune systems is a promising strategy for efficient cancer treatment and tissue repair. Hydrogels are intriguing platforms to circumvent the issues associated to systemic immunotherapy, such as short circulation time, poor targeting to action sites, and severe side effects. In this review, the recent advances in designing hydrogels for immunomodulation in cancer therapy and regenerative medicine are summarized.








Abstract
The immune system not only acts as a defense against pathogen and cancer cells, but also plays an important role in homeostasis and tissue regeneration. Targeting immune systems is a promising strategy for efficient cancer treatment and regenerative medicine. Current systemic immunomodulation therapies are usually associated with low persistence time, poor targeting to action sites, and severe side effects. Due to their extracellular matrix&#8208;mimetic nature, tunable properties and diverse bioactivities, hydrogels are intriguing platforms to locally deliver immunomodulatory agents and cells, as well as provide an immunomodulatory microenvironment to recruit, activate, and expand host immune cells. In this review, the design considerations, including polymer backbones, crosslinking mechanisms, physicochemical nature, and immunomodulation&#8208;related components, of the hydrogel platforms, are focused on. The immunomodulatory effects and therapeutic outcomes in cancer therapy and tissue regeneration of different hydrogel systems are emphasized, including hydrogel depots for delivery of immunomodulatory agents, hydrogel scaffolds for cell delivery, and immunomodulatory hydrogels depending on the intrinsic properties of materials. Finally, the remained challenges in current systems and future development of immunomodulatory hydrogels are discussed.

         <title>Electrolyte and Interphase Engineering of Aqueous Batteries Beyond &#8220;Water&#8208;in&#8208;Salt&#8221; Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrolyte and interphase engineering of aqueous batteries to overcome the drawbacks of the &#8220;water&#8208;in&#8208;salt&#8221; strategy is summarized, including the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art developments of electrolytes, electrode&#8211;electrolyte interphases, and electrodes.








Abstract
Aqueous batteries are promising alternatives to non&#8208;aqueous lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to their safety, environmental impact, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, their energy density is limited by the narrow electrochemical stability window (ESW) of water. The &#8220;Water&#8208;in&#8208;salts&#8221; (WIS) strategy is an effective method to broaden the ESW by reducing the &#8220;free water&#8221; in the electrolyte, but the drawbacks (high cost, high viscosity, poor low&#8208;temperature performance, etc.) also compromise these inherent superiorities. In this review, electrolyte and interphase engineering of aqueous batteries to overcome the drawbacks of the WIS strategy are summarized, including the developments of electrolytes, electrode&#8211;electrolyte interphases, and electrodes. First, the main challenges of aqueous batteries and the problems of the WIS strategy are comprehensively introduced. Second, the electrochemical functions of various electrolyte components (e.g., additives and solvents) are summarized and compared. Gel electrolytes are also investigated as a special form of electrolyte. Third, the formation and modification of the electrolyte&#8208;induced interphase on the electrode are discussed. Specifically, the modification and contribution of electrode materials toward improving the WIS strategy are also introduced. Finally, the challenges of aqueous batteries and the prospects of electrolyte and interphase engineering beyond the WIS strategy are outlined for the practical applications of aqueous batteries.

         <title>Photochemically Activated 3D Printing Inks: Current Status, Challenges, and Opportunities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enabling precision control over photochemical reactions is essential for designing advanced photoresists with diverse functionalities. Herein, recent advances in photoresist design for light&#8208;driven 3D printing are evaluated. The discussed photoresists are classified into chemistries that function photoinitiator&#8208;free and those that require a photoinitiator to proceed, enabling a comprehensive understanding of their capabilities, limitations, and realistic possibilities for the near future.








Abstract
3D printing with light is enabled by the photochemistry underpinning it. Without fine control over the ability to photochemically gate covalent bond formation by the light at a certain wavelength and intensity, advanced photoresists with functions spanning from on&#8208;demand degradability, adaptability, rapid printing speeds, and tailored functionality are impossible to design. Herein, recent advances in photoresist design for light&#8208;driven 3D printing applications are critically assessed, and an outlook of the outstanding challenges and opportunities is provided. This is achieved by classing the discussed photoresists in chemistries that function photoinitiator&#8208;free and those that require a photoinitiator to proceed. Such a taxonomy is based on the efficiency with which photons are able to generate covalent bonds, with each concept featuring distinct advantages and drawbacks.

         <title>Materials Strategies Tackling Interfacial Issues in Catalyst Layers of Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective focuses on the latest progresses in material sciences for solving the problems related to the catalyst/ionomer interface in PEMFCs, with particular emphasis put on the effects of materials structures and intermolecular interactions. The content covers catalysts, ionomers, and additives. Based on molecule&#8208;level understanding, the challenges for the application of established materials and opportunities to broaden the material library are proposed.








Abstract
The most critical challenge for the large&#8208;scale commercialization of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), one of the primary hydrogen energy technologies, is to achieve decent output performance with low usage of platinum (Pt). Currently, the performance of PEMFCs is largely limited by two issues at the catalyst/ionomer interface, specifically, the poisoning of active sites of Pt by sulfonate groups and the extremely sluggish local oxygen transport toward Pt. In the past few years, emerging strategies are derived to tackle these interface problems through materials optimization and innovation. This perspective summarizes the latest advances in this regard, and in the meantime unveils the molecule&#8208;level mechanisms behind the materials modulation of interfacial structures. This paper starts with a brief introduction of processes and structures of catalyst/ionomer interfaces, which is followed by a detailed review of progresses in key materials toward interface optimization, including catalysts, ionomers, and additives, with particular emphasis on the role of materials structure in regulating the intermolecular interactions. Finally, the challenges for the application of the established materials and research directions to broaden the material library are highlighted.

         <title>Nanoparticle&#8208;mediated Delivery of Anti&#8208;PU.1 Sirna via Localized Intracisternal Administration Reduces Neuroinflammation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Neuroinflammation is a hallmark of neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Microglia, the brain's immune cells, express many of the AD&#8208;risk loci identified in genome wide association studies and present a promising target for anti&#8208;inflammatory RNA therapeutics but are difficult to transfect with current methods. Here, we examined several lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulations and identified a lead candidate that supports efficient RNA delivery in cultures of human stem cell&#8208;derived microglia&#8208;like cells (iMGLs) and animal models of neuroinflammation. The lead microglia LNP (MG&#8208;LNP) formulation showed minimal toxicity and improved delivery efficiency to inflammatory iMGLs, suggesting a preference for delivery into activated microglia. Systemic injection of the MG&#8208;LNP formulation generated wide&#8208;spread expression of the delivered reporter construct in all organs whereas local intracisternal injection directly into the cerebrospinal fluid led to preferential expression in the brain. We showed that LNP&#8208;mediated delivery of siRNA targeting the PU.1 transcription factor, a known AD&#8208;risk locus, successfully reduced PU.1 levels in iMGLs and reduced neuroinflammation in mice injected with LPS and in CK&#8208;p25 mice that mimic the chronic neuroinflammation seen in AD patients. Our LNP formulation represents an effective RNA delivery vehicle when applied intrathecally and can be broadly utilized to test potential neuroinflammation&#8208;directed gene therapies.

Microglia, the brain's immune cells, express many of the AD-risk loci identified in genome wide association studies and present a promising target for anti-inflammatory RNA therapeutics but are difficult to transfect with current methods. Here, we examined several lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulations and identified a lead candidate that supports efficient RNA delivery in cultures of human stem cell-derived microglia-like cells (iMGLs) and animal models of neuroinflammation. The lead microglia LNP (MG-LNP) formulation showed minimal toxicity and improved delivery efficiency to inflammatory iMGLs, suggesting a preference for delivery into activated microglia. Systemic injection of the MG-LNP formulation generated wide-spread expression of the delivered reporter construct in all organs whereas local intracisternal injection directly into the cerebrospinal fluid led to preferential expression in the brain.

         <title>Programmable Dynamic Information Storage Composite Film with Highly Sensitive Thermochromism and Gradually Adjustable Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The development of an integrated material system capable of effectively organizing and combining multisource information, such as dynamic pigmentary, structural and fluorescent colors, is significant and challenging. Achieving such programmable dynamic information storage could considerably enhance the diversity and security of information deliveries. Here, we present a polymer&#8208;stabilized cholesteric liquid crystal (PSCLC) system with highly temperature&#8208;sensitive structural color and light&#8208;sensitive pigmentary and fluorescence colors. The prepared CLCs can reversibly change its structural color from red to blue within variational 3&#176;C near room temperature, and exhibit a gradually adjustable fluorescence which can transform from blue to pink and finally to bright red. All this dynamic information is programmable and tailored, hundreds of thousands of (&gt;540,000) pattern combinations can easily achieve by optical writing with a &#8220;bagua&#8221; pattern photomask. Therefore, if the corresponding code combinations to the pattern are assigned particular meanings, encrypted transmission of information with very high security can be achieved by utilizing applicable information encoding tables and decryption rules.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature, Current&#8208;Induced Magnetization Self&#8208;Switching in A Van Der Waals Ferromagnet</title>

Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional layered materials with broken inversion symmetry are being extensively pursued as spin&#8208;orbit coupling layers to realize high&#8208;efficiency magnetic switching. Such low&#8208;symmetry layered systems are, however, scarce. In addition, most layered magnets with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy show a low Curie temperature. Here, we report the experimental observation of spin&#8208;orbit torque magnetization self&#8208;switching at room temperature in a layered polar ferromagnetic metal, Fe2.5Co2.5GeTe2. The spin&#8208;orbit torque is generated from the broken inversion symmetry along the c axis of the crystal. Our results provide a direct pathway toward applicable two&#8208;dimensional spintronic devices.

         <title>Au Nanocluster Assisted Microstructural Reconstruction for Buried Interface Healing for Enhanced Perovskite Solar Cell Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The heterogeneity of perovskite film crystallization along the vertical direction leads to voids and traps at the buried interfaces, hampering both efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells. Here, bovine serum albumin&#8208;functionalized Au nanoclusters (ABSA), combined with heavy gravity, high surface charge density and strong interactions with the electron transport layer, are designed to reconstruct the buried interfaces for not only high&#8208;quality crystallization, but also improved carrier transfer. The ABSA macromolecules with amine function groups and larger surface charge density interact with the perovskite to improve the crystallinity, and gradually migrate towards the buried interface, healing the defective voids, hence suppressing surface recombination velocity from 3075 to 452 cm&#183;s&#8722;1. The healed buried interface and the higher surface potential of ABSA&#8208;modified TiO2 lead to improved carrier extraction at the interface. The resulting solar cell attains a power conversion efficiency of 25.0% with negligible hysteresis and remarkable stability, maintaining 92.9% of their initial efficiency after 3200 hours of exposure to the ambient atmosphere, they also exhibit better continuous irradiation stability compared to control devices. Our findings provide a new metal&#8208;protein complex to eliminate the deleterious voids and defects at the buried interface for improved photovoltaic performance and stability.

         <title>Split&#8208;Type Magnetic Soft Tactile Sensor with Three&#8208;Dimensional Force Decoupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Tactile sensory organs for sensing three&#8208;dimensional (3D) force, such as human skin and fish lateral lines, are indispensable for organisms. With their sensory properties enhanced by layered structures, typical sensory organs can achieve excellent perception as well as protection under frequent mechanical contact. Here, inspired by these layered structures, we introduce a split&#8208;type magnetic soft tactile sensor with wireless 3D&#8208;force sensing and a high accuracy (1.33%) fabricated by developing a centripetal magnetization arrangement and theoretical decoupling model. The 3D force decoupling capability enables it to achieve a perception close to that of human skin in multiple dimensions without complex calibration. Benefiting from the 3D force decoupling capability and split design with a long effective distance (&gt;20&#160;mm), several sensors are assembled in air and water to achieve delicate robotic operation and water flow&#8208;based navigation with an offset &lt; 1.03%, illustrating the extensive potential of magnetic tactile sensors in flexible electronics, human&#8210;machine interactions, and bionic robots.

         <title>Rapid Synthesis of Trimetallic Nanozyme for Sustainable Cascaded Catalytic Therapy via Tumor Microenvironment Remodulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;responsive nanozyme&#8208;catalyzed cancer therapy shows great potential due to its specificity and efficiency. However, breaking the self&#8208;adaption of tumors and improving the sustainable remodeling TME ability remains a major challenge for developing novel nanozymes. In this study, a rapid method is firstly developed to synthesize unprecedented trimetalic nanozyme (AuMnCu, AMC) with a targeting peptide (AMCc), which exhibits excellent peroxidase&#8208;like, catalase&#8208;like, and glucose oxidase&#8208;like activities. AMCc consumes endogenous H2O2 and produce O2, while the released Cu and Mn ions in TME catalyze glucose oxidation reaction to generate H2O2 and gluconic acid, which achieves the starvation therapy by depleting the energy and enhances the chemodynamic therapy effect by lowering the pH of the TME and producing extra H2O2. Meanwhile, the reactive oxygen species damage was amplified, as AMCc can constantly oxidize intracellular reductive glutathione through the cyclic valence alternation of Cu and Mn ions, and the generated Cu+ elevate the production of &#183;OH from H2O2. Further studies depict that the well&#8208;designed AMCc exhibit the excellent photothermal performance, and achieve TME&#8208;responsive sustainable starvation/photothermal&#8208;enhanced chemodynamic synergistic effects in vitro and in vivo. Overall, this work demonstrates a promising approach to design &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; nanozyme for theranostics by remodeling the TME.

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule Graphene Liquid Cell Electron Microscopy for Instability of Intermediate Amyloid Fibrils</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Single&#8208;molecule techniques are powerful microscopy methods that provide new insights into biological processes. Liquid&#8208;phase transmission electron microscopy (LP&#8208;TEM) is an ideal single&#8208;molecule technique for overcoming the poor spatiotemporal resolution of optical approaches. However, single&#8208;molecule LP&#8208;TEM is limited by several challenges such as electron&#8208;beam&#8208;induced molecular damage, difficulty in identifying biomolecular species, and a lack of analytical approaches for conformational dynamics. Herein, we present a single&#8208;molecule graphene liquid&#8208;cell TEM (GLC&#8208;TEM) technique that enables the investigation of real&#8208;time structural perturbations of intact amyloid fibrils. We demonstrate that graphene membranes significantly extend the observation period of native amyloid beta proteins without causing oxidative damage owing to electron beams, which is necessary for imaging. Stochastic and time&#8208;resolved investigations of single fibrils reveal that structural perturbations in the early fibrillar stage are responsible for the formation of various amyloid polymorphs. The advantage of observing structural behavior in real time with unprecedented resolution will potentially make GLC&#8208;TEM a complementary approach to other single&#8208;molecule techniques.

         <title>Large&#8208;Area Flexible Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Enabled by Inkjet Printing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Metal halide perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) are attracting increasing attention due to their potential applications in flat panel lighting and displays. The solution process, large&#8208;area fabrication, and flexibility are attractive properties of PeLEDs over traditional inorganic LEDs. However, it is still very challenging to deposit uniform perovskite films on flexible substrates using blade or slot&#8208;die coating, as the flexible substrate is not perfectly flat. Here, we adopt the inkjet printing technique and overcome the key challenges step&#8208;by&#8208;step in preparing large&#8208;area films on flexible substrates. We first use double hole transporting layers and a wetting interfacial layer to improve the surface wettability so that the printed perovskite droplets can form a continuous wet film. We then manipulate the fluidic and evaporation dynamics of the perovskite wet layer to suppress the coffee ring effect by solvent engineering. We finally obtained uniform perovskite films on flexible substrates with different perovskite compositions. The peak EQE of the inkjet&#8208;printed PeLEDs reaches 14.3%. Large&#8208;area flexible PeLEDs (4&#215;7 cm2) also show very uniform emission. Our work represents a significant step toward real applications of large&#8208;area PeLEDs in flexible flat panel lighting.

The heterogeneous integration of cesium lead bromide LEDs and molybdenum disulfide&#8208;based thin&#8208;film transistors enables the fabrication of active&#8208;matrix perovskite light&#8208;emitting diode (PeLED) display. The single&#8208;source evaporation method enables the deposition of uniform perovskite thin films over large areas. The fabricated active&#8208;matrix display exhibits excellent brightness control capability and a high switching speed, indicating the potential of PeLED as a promising light source.








Abstract
The uniform deposition of perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) and their integration with backplane thin&#8208;film transistors (TFTs) remain challenging for large&#8208;area display applications. Herein, an active&#8208;matrix PeLED display fabricated via the heterogeneous integration of cesium lead bromide LEDs and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2)&#8208;based TFTs is presented. The single&#8208;source evaporation method enables the deposition of highly uniform perovskite thin films over large areas. PeLEDs are integrated with MoS2 TFTs to fabricate an active&#8208;matrix PeLED display with an 8 &#215; 8 array, which exhibits excellent brightness control capability and high switching speed. This study demonstrates the potential of PeLEDs as candidates for next&#8208;generation displays and presents a novel approach for fabricating optoelectronic devices via the heterogeneous integration of 2D materials and perovskites, thereby paving the way toward the fabrication of practical future optoelectronic systems.

         <title>Pillararene&#8208;Based Supramolecular Polymers for Adsorption and Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular polymer materials have attracted significant attention for wide potential applications in numerous fields, particularly in adsorption and separation, due to the elegant combination of supramolecular chemistry with polymer science. This review highlights the recent advancements in pillararene&#8208;based supramolecular polymers for adsorption and separation applications, with an emphasis on their synthetic strategies, adsorption mechanisms, and separation performances.








Abstract
Supramolecular polymers have attracted increasing attention in recent years due to their perfect combination of supramolecular chemistry and traditional polymer chemistry. The design and synthesis of macrocycles have driven the rapid development of supramolecular chemistry and polymer science. Pillar[n]arenes, a new generation of macrocyclic compounds possessing unique pillar&#8208;shaped structures, nano&#8208;sized cavities, multi&#8208;functionalized groups, and excellent host&#8211;guest complexation abilities, are promising candidates to construct supramolecular polymer materials with enhanced properties and functionalities. This review summarizes recent progress in the design and synthesis of pillararene&#8208;based supramolecular polymers (PSPs) and illustrates their diverse applications as adsorption and separation materials. All performances are evaluated and analyzed in terms of efficiency, selectivity, and recyclability. Typically, PSPs can be categorized into three typical types according to their topologies, including linear, cross&#8208;linked, and hybrid structures. The advances made in the area of functional supramolecular polymeric adsorbents formed by new pillararene derivatives are also described in detail. Finally, the remaining challenges and future perspectives of PSPs for separation&#8208;based materials science are discussed. This review will inspire researchers in different fields and stimulate creative designs of supramolecular polymeric materials based on pillararenes and other macrocycles for effective adsorption and separation of a variety of targets.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supramolecular polymers have attracted increasing attention in recent years due to their perfect combination of supramolecular chemistry and traditional polymer chemistry. The design and synthesis of macrocycles have driven the rapid development of supramolecular chemistry and polymer science. Pillar[n]arenes, a new generation of macrocyclic compounds possessing unique pillar-shaped structures, nano-sized cavities, multi-functionalized groups, and excellent host&#8211;guest complexation abilities, are promising candidates to construct supramolecular polymer materials with enhanced properties and functionalities. This review summarizes recent progress in the design and synthesis of pillararene-based supramolecular polymers (PSPs) and illustrates their diverse applications as adsorption and separation materials. All performances are evaluated and analyzed in terms of efficiency, selectivity, and recyclability. Typically, PSPs can be categorized into three typical types according to their topologies, including linear, cross-linked, and hybrid structures. The advances made in the area of functional supramolecular polymeric adsorbents formed by new pillararene derivatives are also described in detail. Finally, the remaining challenges and future perspectives of PSPs for separation-based materials science are discussed. This review will inspire researchers in different fields and stimulate creative designs of supramolecular polymeric materials based on pillararenes and other macrocycles for effective adsorption and separation of a variety of targets.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Piezoionic High Performance Hydrogel Generator and Active Protein Absorber via Microscopic Porosity and Phase Blending</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Potent piezoionic electricity is achieved in a porous and phase hybrid hydrogel, taking advantage of the engineered differences in flow velocities between sodium and chloride ions upon mechanical stimuli. Dynamic voltages up to 600&#160;mV and effective protein adsorptions are obtained. Potential application in nerve function adjustment, mimetic tactile sensors, hydrogel P/N heterojunction building, and enzyme immobilization are proposed.








Abstract
Generating electricity in hydrogel is very important but remains difficult. Hydrogel with electricity generation capability is more capable in bio&#8208;relevant tasks such as tissue engineering, artificial skin, or medical treatment, because electricity is indispensable in regulating physiological activities. Here, a porous and phase blending hydrogel structure for effective piezoionic electricity generation is developed. Dynamic electric field is generated taking advantage of the difference in streaming speeds of sodium and chloride in the material. Microscopic porosity and hydrophilic&#8208;hydrophobic phase blending are the two key factors for prominent piezoionic performance. Voltages as high as 600&#160;mV are first realized in hydrogels in response to medical ultrasound stimulation. The hydrogel structure is also subjective to effective substance exchange and can actively enrich proteins from surroundings under mechanical stimuli. Preliminary applications in neural stimulation, constructing complex spatial&#8208;temporal chemical and electric field distribution patterns, mimetic tactile sensor, sample pretreatment in fast detection, and enzyme immobilization are demonstrated.

         <title>Fiber&#8208;Integrated Force Sensor using 3D Printed Spring&#8208;Composed Fabry&#8208;Perot Cavities with a High Precision Down to Tens of Piconewton</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fiber&#8208;integrated force probe using a spring FP cavity for general&#8208;uses is proposed. The force&#8208;sensitivity and resolution reach (0.436 &#177; 0.007) nmnN&#8208;1 and (40.0 &#177; 0.7) pN, respectively, representing the highest precisions among all fiber&#8208;based nanomechanical probes. Typically, it uses the sensor to explore the micro&#8208;scale nonlinear problems in fluid mechanics. It anticipates the easy&#8208;to&#8208;use force probe will generate significant impacts for accurate force&#8208;detection.








Abstract
Developing microscale sensors capable of force measurements down to the scale of piconewtons is of fundamental importance for a wide range of applications. To date, advanced instrumentations such as atomic force microscopes and other specifically developed micro/nano&#8208;electromechanical systems face challenges such as high cost, complex detection systems and poor electromagnetic compatibility. Here, it presents the unprecedented design and 3D printing of general fiber&#8208;integrated force sensors using spring&#8208;composed Fabry&#8208;Perot cavities. It calibrates these microscale devices employing varied&#8208;diameter &#956;$\umu$ m&#8208;scale silica particles as standard weights. The force sensitivity and resolution reach values of (0.436 &#177; 0.007) nmnN&#8208;1 and (40.0 &#177; 0.7) pN, respectively, which are the best resolutions among all fiber&#8208;based nanomechanical probes so far. It also measured the non&#8208;linear airflow force distributions produced from a nozzle with an orifice of 2 &#956;$\umu$ m, which matches well with the full&#8208;sized simulations. With further customization of their geometries and materials, it anticipates the easy&#8208;to&#8208;use force probe can well extend to many other applications such as air/fluidic turbulences sensing, micro&#8208;manipulations, and biological sensing.

         <title>Shortwave Infrared Organic Photodiodes Realized by Polaron Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
A novel approach for developing shortwave infrared (SWIR) organic photodiodes (OPDs) using doped polymers is presented. SWIR OPDs are challenging to produce because of the limitations in extending the absorption of conjugated molecules and the high dark currents of SWIR&#8208;absorbing materials. Herein, we show that the conversion of bound polarons to free polarons by light energy can be utilized as a SWIR photodetection mechanism. To maximize the bound&#8208;polaron density and bound&#8208;to&#8208;free polaron ratio of the doped polymer film, we engineered the doping process and diffused dopant molecules into the crystalline domain of the polymer matrix and confirm a direct correlation between the bound&#8208;to&#8208;free polaron ratio and device performance. The optimized double&#8208;doped SWIR OPD exhibited a high external quantum efficiency of 77100% and specific detectivity of 1.11 &#215; 1011 Jones against SWIR. These findings demonstrate the application potential of polarons as alternatives for Frenkel excitons in SWIR OPDs.

Abstract
Sound plays a crucial role in our perception of the world. It allows us to communicate, learn, detect potential dangers, diagnose diseases, and much more. However, traditional acoustic sensors are limited in their form factors, being rigid and cumbersome, which restricts their potential applications. Recently, acoustic sensors have made significant advancements, transitioning from rudimentary forms to wearable devices and smart everyday clothing that can conform to soft, curved, and deformable surfaces or surroundings. In this review, we comprehensively explore the latest scientific and technological breakthroughs with insightful analysis in materials, physics, design principles, fabrication strategies, functions, and applications of flexible and wearable acoustic sensing technology. We highlight the new generation of acoustic sensors that can recognize voice, interact with machines, control robots, enable marine positioning and localization, monitor structural health, diagnose human vital signs in deep tissues, and perform organ imaging. These innovations offer unique solutions to significant challenges in fields such as healthcare, biomedicine, wearables, robotics, and metaverse. Finally, we address the existing challenges and future opportunities in the field, providing strategies to advance acoustic sensing technologies for intriguing real&#8208;world applications and inspire new research directions.

         <title>Cellular Membrane&#8208;Engineered Nanovesicles as a Three&#8208;Stage Booster to Target&#160;the Lesion Core</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 48, November 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
For targeted delivery to the lesion core of injured myocardium, a cellular membrane&#8208;engineered nanovesicle (CMEV) is constructed by integrating a neutrophil membrane, specific antibody, and gelled drug&#8208;loaded core as a three&#8208;stage booster. CMEV enhances the efficacy of catestatin in improving cardiomyocyte apoptosis, excessive fibrosis, macrophage polarization, and angiogenesis. Thus, CMEV significantly ameliorates cardiac function and adverse remodeling to treat ischemic cardiomyopathy.








Abstract
The lesion core is the area with the most serious injury and vigorous repair. Existing nanocarriers are difficult to break through the targeted delivery to the lesion core for precise treatment in the intracellular and extracellular microenvironment. Herein, a cellular membrane&#8208;engineered nanovesicle (CMEV) with a hierarchical structure is constructed using the double emulsion&#8208;extrusion method by integrating a neutrophil membrane, functional antibody, and gelled drug&#8208;loaded core as a three&#8208;stage booster to target the lesion core and deliver catestatin (CST), a small therapeutic peptide, for ischemic cardiomyopathy therapy. By coating the neutrophil membrane outside the shell, CMEV is endowed with the function of neutrophil&#8208;like migration to achieve the first stage of tissue targeting. Based on the specific anchoring to injured myocardium, a myosin light chain 3 (MLC3) antibody is embedded to fulfill the second stage of CMEV accumulation in the lesion core. The gelled core containing CST&#8208;sodium alginate (NaAlg) with a pH&#8208;responsive shell is prepared by ionic cross&#8208;linking to accomplish the third stage of precise CST administration. Triggered by the microenvironment, NaAlg electrostatically adheres to the lesion core for sustained release, enhancing the efficacy of CST in improving cardiomyocyte apoptosis, excessive fibrosis, macrophage polarization, and angiogenesis. Thus, the &#8220;three&#8208;stage booster&#8221; nanovesicle significantly ameliorates cardiac function and adverse remodeling to treat ischemic cardiomyopathy.

         <title>Introducing a Phenyl End Group in the Inner Side Chains of A&#8208;DA'D&#8208;A Acceptors Enables High&#8208;Efficiency Organic Solar Cells Processed with Nonhalogenated Solvent</title>

         <dc:description>
Two new small molecule acceptors Y6&#8208;Ph and L8&#8208;Ph with phenyl&#8208;alkyl inner side chains are synthesized. The results show that the phenyl&#8208;alkyl side chains can suppress the molecular excessive aggregation and make the molecular packing more orderly under the long&#8208;time film&#8208;forming process with nonhalogenated solvents processing. Therefore, the L8&#8208;Ph&#8208;based organic solar cells processed by o&#8208;xylene achieve a high power conversion efficiency of 18.40%.








Abstract
Power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs) processed by nonhalogenated solvents is unsatisfactory due to the unfavorable morphology. Herein, two new small molecule acceptors&#160;(SMAs) Y6&#8208;Ph and L8&#8208;Ph are synthesized by introducing a phenyl end group in the inner side chains of the SMAs of Y6 and L8&#8208;BO, respectively, for overcoming the excessive aggregation of SMAs in the long&#8208;time film forming processed by nonhalogenated solvents. First, the effect of the film forming time on the aggregation property and photovoltaic performance of Y6, L8&#8208;BO, Y6&#8208;Ph, and L8&#8208;Ph is studied by using the commonly used solvents: chloroform (CF) (rapid film forming process) and chlorobenzene (CB) (slow film forming process). It is&#160;found that Y6&#8208; and L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based OSCs exhibit a dramatic drop in PCE&#160;from CF&#8208; to CB&#8208;processed devices owing to the large phase separation, while the Y6&#8208;Ph and L8&#8208;Ph based OSCs show obviously increased PCEs Furthermore, L8&#8208;Ph&#8208;based OSCs processed by nonhalogenated solvent o&#8208;xylene (o&#8208;XY) achieved a high PCE of 18.40% with an FF of 80.11%. The results indicate that introducing a phenyl end group in the inner side chains is an effective strategy to modulate the morphology and improve the photovoltaic performance of the OSCs processed by nonhalogenated solvents.

         <title>Intermediates Regulation via Electron&#8208;Deficient Cu Sites for Selective Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 48, November 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu/Co0.85SeVSe nanosheets for catalyzing NO3RR are developed by introducing Cu dopants and Se vacancies into Cu0.85Se to efficiently enhance electron transfer from Cu to Co through the bridging Se atoms, leading to the formation of deficient electronic Cu sites that accelerate NO3&#8722; dissociation and eventually facilitate the NO3RR process.








Abstract
Ammonia (NH3), known as one of the fundamental raw materials for manufacturing commodities such as chemical fertilizers, dyes, ammunitions, pharmaceuticals, and textiles, exhibits a high hydrogen storage capacity of &#8776;17.75%. Electrochemical nitrate reduction (NO3RR) to valuable ammonia at ambient conditions is a promising strategy to facilitate the artificial nitrogen cycle. Herein, copper&#8208;doped cobalt selenide nanosheets with selenium vacancies are reported as a robust and highly efficient electrocatalyst for the reduction of nitrate to ammonia, exhibiting a maximum Faradaic efficiency of &#8776;93.5% and an ammonia yield rate of 2360&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.60&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. The in situ spectroscopical and theoretical study demonstrates that the incorporation of Cu dopants and Se vacancies into cobalt selenide efficiently enhances the electron transfer from Cu to Co atoms via the bridging Se atoms, forming the electron&#8208;deficient structure at Cu sites to accelerate NO3&#8722; dissociation and stabilize the *NO2 intermediates, eventually achieving selective catalysis in the entire NO3RR process to produce ammonia efficiently.

         <title>Tunable Chiral Plasmonic Activities Enabled via Stimuli Responsive Micro&#8208;Origami</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 48, November 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D chiral plasmonic structures are realized through shape&#8208;morphing of responsive polymer&#8208;based origami. Gold nanospheres (AuNSs) are assembled as large&#8208;scale, highly ordered linear chains on 2D rectangular polymer micro&#8208;sheets. Upon self&#8208;rolling of the sheets into micro&#8208;tubules, the AuNSs can be arranged in a 3D helical morphology. Tunable circular dichroism signals over mode frequency, magnitude, and switchable handedness are achieved.








Abstract
Chiral plasmonic nanomaterials with distinctive circularly polarized light&#8208;dependent optical responses over a broad range of frequency have great potential for photonic and biomedical applications. However, it still remains challenging to fabricate 3D plasmonic chiral micro&#8208;constructs with readily modulated chiroptical properties over the magnitude of ellipticity, mode frequency, and switchable handedness, especially in the vis&#8211;NIR range. In this study, polymeric micro&#8208;origami&#8208;based 3D plasmonic chiral structures are constructed through self&#8208;rolling of gold&#160; nanospheres (AuNSs)&#8208;decorated polymeric micro&#8208;sheets. Spherical AuNSs are assembled as highly ordered linear chains on 2D rectangular micro&#8208;sheets by polydimethylsiloxane&#8208;wrinkle assisted assembly. Upon rolling the micro&#8208;sheets to micro&#8208;tubules, the AuNS chains transform into 3D helices. The AuNS&#8208;assembled helices induce collective plasmonic modes propagating in a helical manner, leading to a strong chiral response over the vis&#8211;NIR range. The circular dichroism (CD) is measured to be as high as hundreds of millidegree, and the position and sign of CD peaks are actively modulated by controlling the orientated angle of AuNS chains, enabled by tuning the collective plasmonic modes. This micro&#8208;origami&#8208;based strategy incorporates the incompatible 2D assembly technique with 3D chiral structures, opening up an intriguing way toward constructing chiral plasmonic structures and modulating chiroptical effects based on responsive polymeric materials.

         <title>Advancing Energy Harvesting Efficiency from a Single Droplet: A Mechanically Guided 4D Printed Elastic Hybrid Droplet&#8208;Based Electricity Generator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 48, November 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid droplet&#8208;based electricity generator (HDEG) is first developed by simply hybridizing droplet&#8208;based electricity generator and solid&#8211;solid triboelectric nanogenerator, using mechanically guided 4D printing. HDEG has an enhanced electrical output performance from a single droplet by using the dissipated energy during droplet impact. This approach opens a new frontier in system development that efficiently collects energy from the ubiquitous droplets.








Abstract
A droplet possesses the ubiquity and potential to harvest a vast amount of energy. To exploit droplets effectively, a novel output enhancement strategy that can coexist and create synergy with the recently studied droplet&#8208;based electricity generator (DEG) and material/surface structure modification must be investigated. In this study, a mechanical buckling&#8208;based 4D printed elastic hybrid droplet&#8208;based electricity generator (HDEG) consisting of a DEG and solid&#8211;solid triboelectric nanogenerator (S&#8211;S TENG) is first presented. During the electricity generation process of the DEG by droplet impact, the HDEG structure, which is merged via a simple 4D printing technique, permits the conversion of dissipated energy into elastic energy, resulting in an S&#8211;S TENG output. The HDEG outputs are naturally integrated owing to the simultaneous activation of a single droplet, resulting in an approximately 30% improvement over the output of a single DEG. Internal and external parametric studies are performed as HDEG design guidelines. The HDEG exhibits a 25% better energy supply performance than that of a single DEG, demonstrating its applicability as a power source. This research proposes the way toward a hybrid system that efficiently harvests energy from ubiquitous droplets.

         <title>Interfacial Polymerization Produced Magnetic Particles with Nano&#8208;Filopodia for Highly Accurate Liquid Biopsy in the PSA Gray Zone</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 48, November 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Immune cell&#8208;inspired magnetic particles with nano&#8208;filopodia (NFMPs) are successfully prepared, capturing circulating tumor cells (CTCs) efficiently with high sensitivity, superior to commercial magnetic microparticles. The nano&#8208;filopodia are unprecedentedly constructed on polymer&#8208;based magnetic particles by introducing electrostatic interactions in emulsion interfacial polymerization. Assisted by machine learning, the NFMPs strategy demonstrates high sensitivity (100%), enabling accurate clinical prostate cancer diagnosis in the prostate&#8208;specific antigen (PSA) gray zone.








Abstract
Magnetic particles are leading separation materials for biological purification and detection. Existing magnetic particles, which almost rely on molecule&#8208;level interactions, however, often encounter bottlenecks in highly efficient cell&#8208;level separation due to the underestimate of surface structure effects. Here, immune cell&#8208;inspired magnetic particles with nano&#8208;filopodia (NFMPs) produced by interfacial polymerization for highly efficient capture of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and further accurate clinical diagnosis of prostate cancer are reported . The unprecedented construction of nano&#8208;filopodia on polymer&#8208;based magnetic particles is achieved by introducing electrostatic interactions in emulsion interfacial polymerization. Due to the unique nano&#8208;filopodia, the NFMPs allow remarkably enhanced CTCs capture efficiency (86.5%&#160;&#177;&#160;2.8%) compared with smooth magnetic particles (SMPs, 35.7%&#160;&#177;&#160;5.7%). Under the assistance of machine learning by combining with prostate&#8208;specific antigen (PSA) and free to total PSA (F/T&#8208;PSA), the NFMPs strategy demonstrates high sensitivity (100%), high specificity (93.3%), and a high area under the curve (AUC) value (98.1%) for clinical diagnosis of prostate cancer in the PSA gray zone. The NFMPs are anticipated as an efficient platform for CTCs&#8208;based liquid biopsy toward early cancer diagnosis and prognosis evaluation.

         <title>Genetically Encoded Oligomerization for Protein&#8208;Based Lighting Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 48, November 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The integration of proteins into optoelectronics offers a novel approach toward the development of eco&#8208;friendly materials, replacing non&#8208;sustainable elements while maintaining device efficiency. In this work, a genetically&#8208;encoded macro&#8208;oligomerization strategy which enables versatile, electrostatic&#8208;controlled protein&#8211;protein interactions, ensuring the protein stability in non&#8208;native environments and stressful conditions, is developed.








Abstract
Implementing proteins in optoelectronics represents a fresh idea toward a sustainable new class of materials with bio&#8208;functions that can replace environmentally unfriendly and/or toxic components without losing device performance. However, their native activity (fluorescence, catalysis, and so on) is easily lost under device fabrication/operation as non&#8208;native environments (organic solvents, organic/inorganic interfaces, and so on) and severe stress (temperature, irradiation, and so on) are involved. Herein, a gift bow genetically&#8208;encoded macro&#8208;oligomerization strategy is showcased to promote protein&#8211;protein solid interaction enabling i) high versatility with arbitrary proteins, ii) straightforward electrostatic driven control of the macro&#8208;oligomer size by ionic strength, and iii) stabilities over months in pure organic solvents and stress scenarios, allowing to integrate them into classical water&#8208;free polymer&#8208;based materials/components for optoelectronics. Indeed, rainbow&#8208;/white&#8208;emitting protein&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes are fabricated, attesting a first&#8208;class performance compared to those with their respective native proteins: significantly enhanced device stabilities from a few minutes up to 100&#160;h keeping device efficiency at high power driving conditions. Thus, the oligomerization concept is a solid bridge between biological systems and materials/components to meet expectations in bio&#8208;optoelectronics, in general, and lighting schemes, in particular.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Structured Colloidal Gels for High&#8208;Resolution 3D Micropatterning of Proteins at Scale</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 48, November 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new reaction&#8208;diffusion self&#8208;assembly system in which proteins function as diffusive reactants to assemble stable clay&#8208;protein composite hydrogels is reported. The opportunity to exploit this system to assemble stable 3D patterning of bioactive proteins with high protein loading, resolution, and scalability is demonstrated.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly, the spontaneous ordering of components into patterns, is widespread in nature and fundamental to generating function across length scales. Morphogen gradients in biological development are paradigmatic as both products and effectors of self&#8208;assembly and various attempts have been made to reproduce such gradients in biomaterial design. To date, approaches have typically utilized top&#8208;down fabrication techniques that, while allowing high&#8208;resolution control, are limited by scale and require chemical cross&#8208;linking steps to stabilize morphogen patterns in time. Here, a bottom&#8208;up approach to protein patterning is developed based on a novel binary reaction&#8208;diffusion process where proteins function as diffusive reactants to assemble a nanoclay&#8208;protein composite hydrogel. Using this approach, it is possible to generate scalable and highly stable 3D patterns of target proteins down to sub&#8208;cellular resolution through only physical interactions between clay nanoparticles and the proteins and ions present in blood. Patterned nanoclay gels are able to guide cell behavior to precisely template bone tissue formation in vivo. These results demonstrate the feasibility of stabilizing 3D gradients of biological signals through self&#8208;assembly processes and open up new possibilities for morphogen&#8208;based therapeutic strategies and models of biological development and repair.

         <title>Negative Photoresponse Switching via Electron&#8211;Hole Recombination at The Type III Junction of MoTe2 Channel/SnS2 Top Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 48, November 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;speed phototransistor is designed, which has a type III junction between p&#8208;MoTe2 channel and n&#8208;SnS2 top layer. The photodetecting device operates with a basis of negative photoresponse, which originates from the recombination of photoexcited electrons within the n&#8208;SnS2 layer and accumulated holes in the p&#8208;MoTe2 channel.








Abstract
Extensive study on 2D&#160;van der Waals (vdW) heterojunctions has primarily focused on PN diodes for fast&#8208;switching photodetection, while achieving the same from 2D channel phototransistors is rare despite their other advantages. Here, a high&#8208;speed phototransistor featuring a type III junction between p&#8208;MoTe2 channel and n&#8208;SnS2 top layer is designed. The photodetecting device operates with a basis of negative photoresponse (NPR), which originates from the recombination of photoexcited electrons in n&#8208;SnS2 and accumulated holes in the p&#8208;MoTe2 channel. For the NPR to occur, high&#8208;energy photons capable of exciting SnS2 (band gap &#8776;2.2&#160;eV) are found to be effective because lower&#8208;energy photons simply penetrate the SnS2 top layer only to excite MoTe2, leading to normal positive photoresponse (PPR) which is known to be slow due to the photogating effects. The NPR transistor showcases 0.5&#160;ms fast photoresponses and a high responsivity over 5000 A W&#8722;1. More essentially, such carrier recombination mechanism is clarified with three experimental evidences. The phototransistor is finally modified with Au contact on n&#8208;SnS2, to be a more practical device displaying voltage output. Three different photo&#8208;logic states under blue, near infrared (NIR), and blue&#8208;NIR mixed photons are demonstrated using the voltage signals.

     alt="Negative Photoresponse Switching via Electron&#8211;Hole Recombination at The Type III Junction of MoTe2 Channel/SnS2 Top Layer"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A high-speed phototransistor is designed, which has a type III junction between p-MoTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; channel and n-SnS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; top layer. The photodetecting device operates with a basis of negative photoresponse, which originates from the recombination of photoexcited electrons within the n-SnS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; layer and accumulated holes in the p-MoTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; channel.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extensive study on 2D&#160;van der Waals (vdW) heterojunctions has primarily focused on PN diodes for fast-switching photodetection, while achieving the same from 2D channel phototransistors is rare despite their other advantages. Here, a high-speed phototransistor featuring a type III junction between p-MoTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; channel and n-SnS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; top layer is designed. The photodetecting device operates with a basis of negative photoresponse (NPR), which originates from the recombination of photoexcited electrons in n-SnS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and accumulated holes in the p-MoTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; channel. For the NPR to occur, high-energy photons capable of exciting SnS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (band gap &#8776;2.2&#160;eV) are found to be effective because lower-energy photons simply penetrate the SnS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; top layer only to excite MoTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, leading to normal positive photoresponse (PPR) which is known to be slow due to the photogating effects. The NPR transistor showcases 0.5&#160;ms fast photoresponses and a high responsivity over 5000 A W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. More essentially, such carrier recombination mechanism is clarified with three experimental evidences. The phototransistor is finally modified with Au contact on n-SnS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, to be a more practical device displaying voltage output. Three different photo-logic states under blue, near infrared (NIR), and blue-NIR mixed photons are demonstrated using the voltage signals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A comparative study on four practical combinations of QLED&#8211;TFT integrated devices is herein presented for efficient and stable AM&#8208;QLED display. Taking into consideration device structure and carrier type between QLED and TFT, AM&#8208;QLED display is compared and analyzed to find out ideal combinations, and thus a 5&#215;5 AM&#8208;QLED display array controlled using SWNT TFTs is successfully demonstrated.








Abstract
Active matrix (AM) quantum&#8208;dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs) driven by thin&#8208;film transistors (TFTs) have attracted significant attention for use in next&#8208;generation displays. Several challenges remain for the realisation of AM&#8208;QLEDs, such as device design, fabrication process, and integration between QLEDs and TFTs, depending on their device structures and configurations. Herein, efficient and stable AM&#8208;QLEDs are demonstrated using conventional and inverted structured QLEDs (C&#8208; and I&#8208;QLEDs, respectively) combined with facile type&#8208;convertible (p&#8208; and n&#8208;type) single&#8208;walled carbon nanotube (SWNT)&#8208;based TFTs. Based on the four possible configurations of the QLED&#8211;TFT subpixel, the performance of the SWNT TFT&#8208;driven QLEDs and the fabrication process to determine the ideal configuration are compared, taking advantage of each structure for AM&#8208;QLEDs. The QLEDs and TFTs are also optimized to maximise the performance of the AM&#8208;QLEDs&#8212;the inner shell composition of quantum dots and carrier type of TFTs&#8212;resulting in a maximum external quantum efficiency and operational lifetime (at an initial luminance of 100&#160;cd&#160;m2) of 21.2% and 38&#8201;100&#8201;000&#160;h for the C&#8208;QLED, and 19.1% and 133100000&#160;h for the I&#8208;QLED, respectively. Finally, a 5&#215;5 AM&#8208;QLED display array controlled using SWNT TFTs is successfully demonstrated. This study is expected to contribute to the development of advanced AM&#8208;QLED displays.

         <title>Magnetic Putty as a Reconfigurable, Recyclable, and Accessible Soft Robotic Material</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 48, November 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Permanent magnetic particles embedded in a viscoelastic putty matrix result in a self&#8208;healing soft magnetic material with both high remanence and low coercivity, providing hard&#8208;magnetic performance without the need for inaccessible strong magnetic fields. Programmable and reconfigurable magnetization, frequency&#8208;dependent force output, and easy to shape and assemble, magnetic putty can be a versatile tool in research prototyping and inspire future explorations.








Abstract
Magnetically hard materials are widely used to build soft magnetic robots, providing large magnetic force/torque and macrodomain programmability. However, their high magnetic coercivity often presents practical challenges when attempting to reconfigure magnetization patterns, requiring a large magnetic field or heating. In this study, magnetic putty is introduced as a magnetically hard and soft material with large remanence and low coercivity. It is shown that the magnetization of magnetic putty can be easily reoriented with maximum magnitude using an external field that is only one&#8208;tenth of its coercivity. Additionally, magnetic putty is a malleable, autonomous self&#8208;healing material that can be recycled and repurposed. The authors anticipate magnetic putty could provide a versatile and accessible tool for various magnetic robotics applications for fast prototyping and explorations for research and educational purposes.

         <title>Cation&#8208;Disorder Engineering Promotes Efficient Charge&#8208;Carrier Transport in AgBiS2 Nanocrystal Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 48, November 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Disorder is generally considered as detrimental for charge&#8208;carrier transport, lowering mobilities, and causing fast recombination. However, this work demonstrates that, when properly engineered, cation disorder in the multinary chalcogenide semiconductor AgBiS2 considerably enhances charge&#8208;carrier transport and reduces localization effects. Cation&#8208; disorder engineering is demonstrated as a powerful strategy to tune the optoelectronic properties of new semiconductors for renewable energy applications.








Abstract
Efficient charge&#8208;carrier transport is critical to the success of emergent semiconductors in photovoltaic applications. So far, disorder has been considered detrimental for charge&#8208;carrier transport, lowering mobilities, and causing fast recombination. This work demonstrates that, when properly engineered, cation disorder in a multinary chalcogenide semiconductor can considerably enhance the charge&#8208;carrier mobility and extend the charge&#8208;carrier lifetime. Here, the properties of AgBiS2 nanocrystals (NCs) are explored as a function of Ag and Bi cation&#8208;ordering, which can be modified via thermal&#8208;annealing. Local Ag&#8208;rich and Bi&#8208;rich domains formed during hot&#8208;injection synthesis are transformed to induce homogeneous disorder (random Ag&#8208;Bi distribution). Such cation&#8208;disorder engineering results in a sixfold increase in the charge&#8208;carrier mobility, reaching &#8776;2.7&#8201;cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 in AgBiS2 NC thin films. It is further demonstrated that homogeneous cation disorder reduces charge&#8208;carrier localization, a hallmark of charge&#8208;carrier transport recently observed in silver&#8208;bismuth semiconductors. This work proposes that cation&#8208;disorder engineering flattens the disordered electronic landscape, removing tail states that would otherwise exacerbate Anderson localization of small polaronic states. Together, these findings unravel how cation&#8208;disorder engineering in multinary semiconductors can enhance the efficiency of renewable energy applications.

         <title>Thermally Insulating and Moisture&#8208;Resilient Foams Based on Upcycled Aramid Nanofibers and Nanocellulose</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 48, November 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superinsulating and moisture&#8208;resilient foams of upcycled aramid nanofibers (upANFA) and cellulose nanofibrils (CNF) are reported and the importance of the very small diameter of the upANFA for phonon scattering is highlighted by estimates of the thermal conductivity contributions. Superinsulating foams with significant amounts of upcycled textile nanofibers can reduce the carbon footprint and energy demand in thermal management applications.








Abstract
Low&#8208;density foams and aerogels based on upcycled and bio&#8208;based nanofibers and additives are promising alternatives to fossil&#8208;based thermal insulation materials. Super&#8208;insulating foams are prepared from upcycled acid&#8208;treated aramid nanofibers (upANFA) obtained from Kevlar yarn and tempo&#8208;oxidized cellulose nanofibers (CNF) from wood. The ice&#8208;templated hybrid upANFA/CNF&#8208;based foams with an upANFA content of up to 40&#160;wt% display high thermal stability and a very low thermal conductivity of 18&#8211;23&#160;mW m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 perpendicular to the aligned nanofibrils over a wide relative humidity (RH) range of 20% to 80%. The thermal conductivity of the hybrid upANFA/CNF foams is found to decrease with increasing upANFA content (5&#8211;20&#160;wt%). The super&#8208;insulating properties of the CNF&#8208;upANFA hybrid foams are related to the low density of the foams and the strong interfacial phonon scattering between the very thin and partially branched upANFA and CNF in the hybrid foam walls. Defibrillated nanofibers from textiles are not limited to Kevlar, and this study can hopefully inspire efforts to upcycle textile waste into high&#8208;performance products.

The ice-templated hybrid upANF&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;/CNF-based foams with an upANF&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; content of up to 40&#160;wt% display high thermal stability and a very low thermal conductivity of 18&#8211;23&#160;mW m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; perpendicular to the aligned nanofibrils over a wide relative humidity (RH) range of 20% to 80%. The thermal conductivity of the hybrid upANF&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;/CNF foams is found to decrease with increasing upANF&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; content (5&#8211;20&#160;wt%). The super-insulating properties of the CNF-upANF&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; hybrid foams are related to the low density of the foams and the strong interfacial phonon scattering between the very thin and partially branched upANF&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; and CNF in the hybrid foam walls. Defibrillated nanofibers from textiles are not limited to Kevlar, and this study can hopefully inspire efforts to upcycle textile waste into high-performance products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Antibubbles Enable Tunable Payload Release with Low&#8208;Intensity Ultrasound</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 48, November 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antibubbles are acoustically&#8208;active microstructures that encapsulate large volumes of fluid within an air bubble. Low&#8208;intensity ultrasound can remotely trigger rapid payload release from antibubbles, and the specific response can be tuned during fabrication. Unique release profiles can be realized, ranging from single&#8208;release to stepwise release for precise dosing over multiple stimulation pulses.








Abstract
The benefits of ultrasound are its ease&#8208;of&#8208;use and its ability to precisely deliver energy in opaque and complex media. However, most materials responsive to ultrasound show a weak response, requiring the use of high powers, which are associated with undesirable streaming, cavitation, or temperature rise. These effects hinder response control and may even cause damage to the medium where the ultrasound is applied. Moreover, materials that are currently in use rely on all&#8208;or&#8208;nothing effects, limiting the ability to fine&#8208;tune the response of the material on the fly. For these reasons, there is a need for materials that can respond to low intensity ultrasound with programmable responses. Here it is demonstrated that antibubbles are a low&#8208;intensity&#8208;ultrasound&#8208;responsive material system that can controllably release a payload using acoustic pressures in the kilopascal range. Varying their size and composition tunes the release pressure, and the response can be switched between a single release and stepwise release across multiple ultrasound pulses. Observations using confocal and high&#8208;speed microscopy reveal different ways that can lead to release. These findings lay the groundwork to design antibubbles that controllably respond to low&#8208;intensity ultrasound, opening a wide range of applications ranging from ultrasound&#8208;responsive material systems to carriers for targeted&#160;delivery.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Promoted Ni&#8208;Based Layer Double Hydroxides with Enhanced Deprotonation Capability for Efficient Biomass Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 48, November 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective and efficient electrooxidation of biomass substrates provides a route forward for the production of sustainable hydrocarbon chemistries and simultaneous green hydrogen. Here, ultrathin NiMn layered double hydroxides are engineered with oxygen defects for the selective conversion of 5&#8208;HMF to 2,5&#8208;FDCA (FE &gt; 90%) well within the oxygen evolution reaction potential window, owing to the catalyst propensity toward deprotonation chemistry.








Abstract
Ni&#8208;based hydroxides are promising electrocatalysts for biomass oxidation reactions, supplanting the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to lower overpotentials while producing value&#8208;added chemicals. The identification and subsequent engineering of their catalytically active sites are essential to facilitate these anodic reactions. Herein, the proportional relationship between catalysts&#8217; deprotonation propensity and Faradic efficiency of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (5&#8208;HMF)&#8208;to&#8208;2,5 furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA,&#160;FEFDCA) is revealed by thorough density functional theory (DFT) simulations and atomic&#8208;scale characterizations, including in situ synchrotron diffraction and spectroscopy methods. The deprotonation capability of ultrathin layer&#8208;double hydroxides (UT&#8208;LDHs) is regulated by tuning the covalency of metal (M)&#8208;oxygen (O) motifs through defect site engineering and selection of M3+ co&#8208;chemistry. NiMn UT&#8208;LDHs show an ultrahigh FEFDCA of 99% at 1.37&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and retain a high FEFDCA of 92.7% in the OER&#8208;operating window at 1.52&#160;V, about 2&#215; that of NiFe UT&#8208;LDHs (49.5%) at 1.52&#160;V. Ni&#8211;O and Mn&#8211;O motifs function as dual active sites for HMF electrooxidation, where the continuous deprotonation of Mn&#8211;OH sites plays a dominant role in achieving high selectivity while suppressing OER at high potentials. The results showcase a universal concept of modulating competing anodic reactions in aqueous biomass electrolysis by electronically engineering the deprotonation behavior of metal hydroxides, anticipated to be translatable across various biomass substrates.

         <title>Axially Encoded Mechano&#8208;Metafiber Electronics by Local Strain Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 48, November 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work fabricates continuously encoded mechano&#8208;metafiber by axial integrating stiff and soft elastic components with tailored length and content through program&#8208;controlled microfluidic sequence spinning. This work develops two essential nonlinear deformation modes of spun metafibers, which are local strain amplification and retardation for designing highly sensitive strain sensors, stretchable fiber devices, and high&#8208;voltage supercapacitors as well as axial electroluminescent arrays.








Abstract
Multimaterial integration, such as soft elastic and stiff components, exhibits rich deformation and functional behaviors to meet complex needs. Integrating multimaterials in the level of individual fiber is poised to maximize the functional design capacity of smart wearable electronic textiles, but remains unfulfilled. Here, this work continuously integrates stiff and soft elastic components into single fiber to fabricate encoded mechano&#8208;metafiber by programmable microfluidic sequence spinning (MSS). The sequences with programmable modulus feature the controllable localization of strain along metafiber length. The mechano&#8208;metafibers feature two essential nonlinear deformation modes, which are local strain amplification and retardation. This work extends the sequence&#8208;encoded metafiber into fiber networks to exhibit greatly enhanced strain amplification and retardation capability in cascades. Local strain engineering enables the design of highly sensitive strain sensors, stretchable fiber devices to protect brittle components and the fabrication of high&#8208;voltage supercapacitors as well as axial electroluminescent arrays. The approach allows the scalably design of multimaterial metafibers with programmable localized mechanical properties for woven metamaterials, smart textiles, and wearable electronics.

         <dc:description>
The groundbreaking discovery of Piezo channels reveals how mechanical force initiates the nerve impulses that help to perceive and adapt to the world. This work is an attempt to mimic Piezo channels. A revolutionary two&#8208;terminal transistor gated only by a tiny force &lt;1&#160;&#181;N instead of voltage, achieving over three orders of magnitude ON/OFF ratio is developed.








Abstract
Silicon&#8208;based field effect transistors have underpinned the information revolution in the last 60 years, and there is a strong desire for new materials, devices, and architectures that can help sustain the computing power in the age of big data and artificial intelligence. Inspired by the Piezo channels, a mechanically gated transistor abandoning electric gating altogether, achieving an ON/OFF ratio over three orders of magnitude under a mechanical force of hundreds of nN is developed. The two&#8208;terminal device utilizes flexoelectric polarization induced by strain gradient, which modulates the carrier concentration in a Van der Waals structure significantly, and it mimics Piezo channels for artificial tactile perception. This simple device concept can be easily adapted to a wide range of semiconducting materials, helping promote the fusion between mechanics and electronics in a similar way as mechanobiology.

         <title>Valence Oscillation of Ru Active Sites for Efficient and Robust Acidic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 48, November 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The robust inter&#8208;doped (Ru&#8211;W)Ox heterostructures enhance the activity and stability of acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by inducing valence oscillation and stabilizing RuOx on WOx substrates. The asymmetric Ru&#8211;O&#8211;W units synergistically adsorb oxygen intermediates, resulting in improved intrinsic activity and demonstrating potential for practical applications with low overpotential and excellent stability.








Abstract
The continuous oxidation and leachability of active sites in Ru&#8208;based catalysts hinder practical application in proton&#8208;exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWE). Herein, robust inter&#8208;doped tungsten&#8211;ruthenium oxide heterostructures [(Ru&#8211;W)Ox] fabricated by sequential rapid oxidation and metal thermomigration processes are proposed to enhance the activity and stability of acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The introduction of high&#8208;valent W species induces the valence oscillation of the Ru sites during OER, facilitating the cyclic transition of the active metal oxidation states and maintaining the continuous operation of the active sites. The preferential oxidation of W species and electronic gain of Ru sites in the inter&#8208;doped heterostructure significantly stabilize RuOx on WOx substrates beyond the Pourbaix stability limit of bare RuO2. Furthermore, the asymmetric Ru&#8211;O&#8211;W active units are generated around the heterostructure interface to adsorb the oxygen intermediates synergistically, enhancing the intrinsic OER activity. Consequently, the inter&#8208;doped (Ru&#8211;W)Ox heterostructures not only demonstrate an overpotential of 170&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and excellent stability of 300&#160;h in acidic electrolytes but also exhibit the potential for practical applications, as evidenced by the stable operation at 0.5 A cm&#8722;2 for 300&#160;h in PEMWE.

         <title>Chiral Van Der Waals Superlattices for Enhanced Spin&#8208;Selective Transport and Spin&#8208;Dependent Electrocatalytic Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 48, November 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral&#8208;induced spin selectivity in the chiral TiS2 superlattice is reported. A remarkable spin polarization exceeding 95% is achieved, particularly within the linear transport regime. This groundbreaking achievement represents a promising avenue to incorporate diverse chiral molecules into layered materials, thereby paving the way for extensive applications in the fields of spintronics and spin&#8208;dependent electrochemistry.








Abstract
The emergence of the chiral&#8208;induced spin&#8208;selectivity (CISS) effect offers a new avenue for chiral organic molecules to autonomously manipulate spin configurations, thereby opening up possibilities in spintronics and spin&#8208;dependent electrochemical applications. Despite extensive exploration of various chiral systems as spin filters, one often encounters challenges in achieving simultaneously high conductivity and high spin polarization (SP). In this study, a promising chiral van der Waals superlattice, specifically the chiral TiS2 crystal, is synthesized via electrochemical intercalation of chiral molecules into a metallic TiS2 single crystal. Multiple tunneling processes within the highly ordered chiral layered structure of chiral TiS2 superlattices result in an exceptionally high SP exceeding 90%. This remarkable observation of significantly high SP within the linear transport regime is unprecedented. Furthermore, the chiral TiS2 electrode exhibits enhanced catalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to its remarkable spin&#8208;selectivity for triplet oxygen evolution. The OER performance of chiral TiS2 superlattice crystals presented here exhibits superior characteristics to previously reported chiral MoS2 catalysts, with an approximately tenfold increase in current density. The combination of metallic conductivity and high SP sets the stage for the development of a new generation of CISS materials, enabling a wide range of electron spin&#8208;based applications.

         <title>Inter&#8208;Shell Sliding in Individual Few&#8208;Walled Carbon Nanotubes for Flexible Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 48, November 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electromechanical response of individual carbon nanotubes (CNTs) induced by inter&#8208;shell sliding is studied based on the controlled manipulation of few&#8208;walled CNTs. Reversible and linear electrical current variation induced by inter&#8208;shell sliding with the loading&#8211;unloading of tensile stress is observed. Furtherly, a flexible device based on CNT inter&#8208;shell sliding is fabricated for serving as a reliable human&#8211;computer interface.








Abstract
Few&#8208;walled carbon nanotube (FWCNT) is composed of a few coaxial shells of CNTs with different diameters. The shells in one tube can slide relatively to each other under external forces, potentially leading to regulated electrical properties, which are never explored due to experimental difficulties. In this work, the electromechanical response induced by inter&#8208;shell sliding of individual CNTs is studied and revealed the linear electrical current variation for the first time. Based on centimeter&#8208;long FWCNTs grown through chemical vapor deposition, controllable and reversible inter&#8208;shell sliding is realized while simultaneously recording the electrical current. Reversible and linear current variation with inter&#8208;shell sliding is observed, which is consistent with the proposed inter&#8208;shell tunneling model. Further, a silk fibroin&#8208;assisted transfer technique is developed for long CNTs and realized the fabrication of FWCNT&#8208;based flexible devices. Tensile stress can be applied on the FWCNTs@silk film encapsulated in elastic silicone to induce inter&#8208;shell sliding and thus controls electrical current, which is demonstrated to serve as a new human&#8211;machine interface with high reliability. Besides, it is foreseen that the electromechanical behaviors induced by inter&#8208;layer sliding in 1D nanotubes may also be extended to 2D layered materials, shedding new light on the fabrication of novel electronics.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis of Edge&#8208;Extended Zigzag Graphene Nanoribbons</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 48, November 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a new design motif is introduced to synthesize edge&#8208;extended zigzag graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs). Using scanning probe techniques and density functional theory, the chemical structure and electronic characteristics of a 3&#8208;zigzag&#8208;row ZGNR instance are confirmed. This approach expands the range of possible ZGNRs, contributing to further understanding of structure&#8208;dependent electronic properties in GNRs.








Abstract
Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) have gained significant attention in nanoelectronics due to their potential for precise tuning of electronic properties through variations in edge structure and ribbon width. However, the synthesis of GNRs with highly sought&#8208;after zigzag edges (ZGNRs), critical for spintronics and quantum information technologies, remains challenging. In this study, a design motif for synthesizing a novel class of GNRs termed edge&#8208;extended ZGNRs is presented. This motif enables the controlled incorporation of edge extensions along the zigzag edges at regular intervals. The synthesis of a specific GNR instance&#8212;a 3&#8208;zigzag&#8208;rows&#8208;wide ZGNR&#8212;with bisanthene units fused to the zigzag edges on alternating sides of the ribbon axis is successfully demonstrated. The resulting edge&#8208;extended 3&#8208;ZGNR is comprehensively characterized for its chemical structure and electronic properties using scanning probe techniques, complemented by density functional theory calculations. The design motif showcased here opens up new possibilities for synthesizing a diverse range of edge&#8208;extended ZGNRs, expanding the structural landscape of GNRs and facilitating the exploration of their structure&#8208;dependent electronic properties.

         <dc:description>
A tumor microenvironment&#8208;responsive Na2S2O8&#8208;loaded liquid nanoplatform is fabricated via a general bottom&#8208;up strategy to achieve the systemic delivery of &#8220;ion drugs&#8221; for nanocatalytic cancer therapy.

Nanotechnology is revolutionizing cancer therapy, and catalyzes the emerging of ion&#8208;involved cancer&#8208;therapeutic modality, which unfortunately suffers from undesirable nanocarriers for efficient intracellular ion delivery. To radically extricate from this critical issue, the glutathione (GSH)&#8208;responsive organosilica network is employed to lock the liquid drops at the nanoscale via a general bottom&#8208;up strategy to achieve the systemic delivery of &#8220;ion drugs&#8221;. In this work, a sulfate radical generation donor (Na2S2O8), as a paradigm &#8220;ion drug&#8221;, is entrapped into this liquid nanoparticle for efficiently delivering to the tumor region. After further surface engineering with pH&#8208;responsive tannic acid&#8208;Fe2+ framework, these liquid nanoparticles achieve tumor&#8208;microenvironmental pH/GSH&#8208;dual responsive ion release (Fe2+/Na+/S2O82&#8722;) after reaching the tumor sites, where the Fe2+ further triggers S2O82&#8722; to generate toxic &#8226;SO4&#8722; and &#8226;OH, effectively executing cancer cell ferroptosis (Fe2+, reactive oxygen species&#8212;ROS) and pyroptosis (Na+, ROS). Such a tumor&#8208;responsive/specific liquid nanoplatform is highly instructive for further ion&#8208;mediated nanomedicine and disease treatment.

&lt;p&gt;Nanotechnology is revolutionizing cancer therapy, and catalyzes the emerging of ion-involved cancer-therapeutic modality, which unfortunately suffers from undesirable nanocarriers for efficient intracellular ion delivery. To radically extricate from this critical issue, the glutathione (GSH)-responsive organosilica network is employed to lock the liquid drops at the nanoscale via a general bottom-up strategy to achieve the systemic delivery of &#8220;ion drugs&#8221;.

         <title>Aromatic&#8208;Free Polymers Based All&#8208;Organic Dielectrics with Breakdown Self&#8208;Healing for High&#8208;Temperature Capacitive Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 48, November 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work shows that the high electron transition energy between the structural units of aromatic&#8208;free polymers can effectively inhibit the high&#8208;field electron conduction and improve the high&#8208;temperature capacitive energy storage.








Abstract
High&#8208;temperature dielectric polymers are becoming increasingly desirable for capacitive energy storage in renewable energy utilization, electrified transportation, and pulse power systems. Current dielectric polymers typically require robust aromatic molecular frameworks to ensure structural thermal stability at elevated temperatures. Nevertheless, the introduction of aromatic units compromises electrical insulation owing to pronounced &#960;&#9472;&#960; interactions that facilitate electron transport and eliminate the breakdown self&#8208;healing property owing to their high carbon content. Herein, an aromatic&#8208;free polynorborne copolymer exhibiting electrical conductivity&#8212;two orders of magnitude lower than that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polyetherimide&#8212;at elevated temperatures and high electric fields owing to its large bandgap (&#8776;4.64&#160;eV) and short hopping conduction distance (&#8776;0.63&#160;nm) is described. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the copolymer can effectively suppress the excitation of high&#8208;field valence electrons. Furthermore, the incorporation of trace semiconductors results in high discharge density (3.73&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;3) and charge&#8211;discharge efficiency (95% at 150&#160;&#176;C), outperforming existing high&#8208;temperature dielectric polymers. The excellent electrical breakdown self&#8208;healing capability of the copolymer film at elevated temperatures further demonstrates its potential for use in dielectric capacitors capable of continuous operation under extreme conditions.

         <title>2D Amorphous Iron Selenide Sulfide Nanosheets for Stable and Rapid Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 48, November 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D amorphous ternary iron selenide sulfide nanosheets (a&#8208;FeSeS NSs) are fabricated via a facile wet chemical method. The elaborately designed electrode exhibits outstanding structural stability, negligible volume expansion, highly efficient reversible reaction, and high electrochemical kinetics. Such a 2D amorphization strategy offers guideline for synthesizing electrode materials with much improved overall performance for a variety of reversible energy storage devices.








Abstract
Sodium ion batteries (SIBs) suffer from large electrode volume change and sluggish redox kinetics for the relatively large ionic radius of sodium ions, raising a significant challenge to improve their long&#8208;term cyclability and rate capacity. Here, it is proposed to apply 2D amorphous iron selenide sulfide nanosheets (a&#8208;FeSeS NSs) as an anode material for SIBs and demonstrate that they exhibit remarkable rate capability of 528.7 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1 and long&#8208;life cycle (10&#160;000 cycles) performance (300.4 mAh g&#8722;1). This performance is much more superior to that of the previously reported Fe&#8208;based anode materials, which is attributed to their amorphous structure that alleviates volume expansion of electrode, 2D nature that facilitates electrons/ions transfer, and the S/Se double anions that offer more reaction sites and stabilize the amorphous structure. Such a 2D amorphous strategy provides a fertile platform for structural engineering of other electrode materials, making a more secure energy prospect closer to a reality.

         <title>An Immunomodulatory Hydrogel by Hyperthermia&#8208;Assisted Self&#8208;Cascade Glucose Depletion and ROS Scavenging for Diabetic Foot Ulcer Wound Therapeutics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 48, November 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An immunomodulatory hydrogel with robust hyperthermia&#8208;assisted self&#8208;cascade glucose depletion and ROS scavenging properties is designed for treating diabetic foot ulcer wounds.








Abstract
Current therapeutic protocols for diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs), a severe and rapidly growing chronic complication in diabetic patients, remain nonspecific. Hyperglycemia&#8208;caused inflammation and excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) are common obstacles encountered in DFU wound healing, often leading to impaired recovery. These two effects reinforce each other, forming an endless loop. However, adequate and inclusive methods are still lacking to target these two aspects and break the vicious cycle. This study proposes a novel approach for treating DFU wounds, utilizing an immunomodulatory hydrogel to achieve self&#8208;cascade glucose depletion and ROS scavenging to regulate the diabetic microenvironment. Specifically, AuPt@melanin&#8208;incorporated (GHM3) hydrogel dressing is developed to facilitate efficient hyperthermia&#8208;enhanced local glucose depletion and ROS scavenging. Mechanistically, in vitro/vivo experiments and RNA sequencing analysis demonstrate that GHM3 disrupts the ROS&#8208;inflammation cascade cycle and downregulates the ratio of M1/M2 macrophages, consequently improving the therapeutic outcomes for dorsal skin and DFU wounds in diabetic rats. In conclusion, this proposed approach offers a facile, safe, and highly efficient treatment modality for DFUs.

         <title>A Bi&#8208;Co Corridor Construction Effectively Improving the Selectivity of Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction toward Ammonia by Nearly 100%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 48, November 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Bi&#8208;Co corridor&#8208;like structure is designed by exploiting the limited electron accessibility of Bi element to deposit Co to the bottom of the catalyst. During the electrocatalytic reaction, NO3&#8722; is preferentially adsorbed on the Co site , and part of the escaped intermediate NO2&#8722; will be captured and converted into NH3 by the outer Bi, thus improving the Faraday efficiency.








Abstract
Improving the selective ammonia production capacity of electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) at ambient conditions is critical to the future development and industrial application of electrosynthesis of ammonia. However, the reaction involves multi&#8208;proton and electron transfer as well as the desorption and underutilization of intermediates, posing a challenge to the selectivity of NO3RR. Here the electrodeposition site of Co is modulated by depositing Bi at the bottom of the catalyst, thus obtaining the Co+Bi@Cu NW catalyst with a Bi&#8208;Co corridor structure. In 50&#160;mm NO3&#8722;, Co+Bi@Cu NW exhibits a highest Faraday efficiency of &#8776;100% (99.51%), an ammonia yield rate of 1858.2&#160;&#181;g&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2 and high repeatability at &#8722;0.6&#160;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode. Moreover, the change of NO2&#8722; concentration on the catalyst surface observed by in situ reflection absorption imaging and the intermediates of the NO3RR process detected by electrochemical in situ Raman spectroscopy together verify the NO2&#8722; trapping effect of the Bi&#8208;Co corridor structure. It is believed that the measure of modulating the deposition site of Co by loading Bi element is an easy&#8208;to&#8208;implement general method for improving the selectivity of NH3 production as well as the corresponding scientific research and applications.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; is preferentially adsorbed on the Co site , and part of the escaped intermediate NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; will be captured and converted into NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; by the outer Bi, thus improving the Faraday efficiency.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improving the selective ammonia production capacity of electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RR) at ambient conditions is critical to the future development and industrial application of electrosynthesis of ammonia. However, the reaction involves multi-proton and electron transfer as well as the desorption and underutilization of intermediates, posing a challenge to the selectivity of NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RR. Here the electrodeposition site of Co is modulated by depositing Bi at the bottom of the catalyst, thus obtaining the Co+Bi@Cu NW catalyst with a Bi-Co corridor structure. In 50&#160;m&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, Co+Bi@Cu NW exhibits a highest Faraday efficiency of &#8776;100% (99.51%), an ammonia yield rate of 1858.2&#160;&#181;g&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and high repeatability at &#8722;0.6&#160;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode. Moreover, the change of NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; concentration on the catalyst surface observed by in situ reflection absorption imaging and the intermediates of the NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RR process detected by electrochemical in situ Raman spectroscopy together verify the NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; trapping effect of the Bi-Co corridor structure. It is believed that the measure of modulating the deposition site of Co by loading Bi element is an easy-to-implement general method for improving the selectivity of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; production as well as the corresponding scientific research and applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Semiconducting Polymer Nanospherical Nucleic Acid Probe for Transcriptomic Imaging of Cancer Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 48, November 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semiconducting polymer nanospherical nucleic acid probe (SENSE) responds to targeted granzyme B transcripts of T lymphocytes by releasing the signaling strand, leading to an increase in fluorescence signal of Cyanine 5 dye (NIRF670). With the always&#8208;on fluorescence (NIRF810) of semiconducting polymer nanosphere, SENSE enables the self&#8208;referenced longitudinal imaging of RNA transcript in vivo for the first time.








Abstract
Real&#8208;time in vivo imaging of RNA can enhance the understanding of physio&#8208;pathological processes. However, most nucleic acid&#8208;based sensors have poor resistance to nucleases and limited photophysical properties, making them suboptimal for this purpose. To address this, a semiconducting polymer nanospherical nucleic acid probe (SENSE) for transcriptomic imaging of cancer immunity in living mice is developed. SENSE comprises&#160;a semiconducting polymer (SP) backbone covalently linked with recognition DNA strands, which are complemented by dye&#8208;labeled signal DNA strands. Upon detection of targeted T lymphocyte transcript (Gzmb: granzyme B), the signal strands are released, leading to a fluorescence enhancement correlated to transcript levels with superb sensitivity. The always&#8208;on fluorescence of the SP core also serves as an internal reference for tracking SENSE uptake in tumors. Thus, SENSE has the dual&#8208;signal channel that enables ratiometric imaging of Gzmb transcripts in the tumor of living mice for evaluating chemo&#8208;immunotherapy; moreover, it has demonstrated sensitivity and specificity comparable to flow cytometry and quantitative polymerase chain reaction, &#160;yet offering a faster and simpler means of T cell detection in resected tumors. Therefore, SENSE represents a promising tool for in vivo RNA imaging.

         <title>Synthesis of Clean Hydrogen Gas from Waste Plastic at Zero Net Cost</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 48, November 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Waste plastics are upcycled into H2 and graphene. This catalyst&#8208;free process achieves comparable yields to metal&#8208;catalyzed steam methane reforming (grey H2), producing 84% less greenhouse gases. Further, graphene is produced as a value&#8208;added byproduct while using less energy than electrolysis (green H2). The sale of this graphene at only 5% of the current market value affords clean H2 production at a negative cost.








Abstract
Hydrogen gas (H2) is the primary storable fuel for pollution&#8208;free energy production, with over 90&#160;million tonnes used globally per year. More than 95% of H2 is synthesized through metal&#8208;catalyzed steam methane reforming that produces 11 tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) per tonne H2. &#8220;Green H2&#8221; from water electrolysis using renewable energy evolves no CO2, but costs 2&#8211;3&#215; more, making it presently economically unviable. Here&#160;catalyst&#8208;free conversion of waste plastic into clean H2 along with high purity graphene is reported. The scalable procedure evolves no CO2 when deconstructing polyolefins and produces H2 in purities up to 94% at high mass yields. The sale of graphene byproduct at just 5% of its current value yields H2 production at a negative cost. Life&#8208;cycle assessment demonstrates a 39&#8211;84% reduction in emissions compared to other H2 production methods, suggesting the flash H2 process to be an economically viable, clean H2 production route.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of Cubic K3&#8722;2xBaxSbSe4 Solid Electrolytes for K&#8211;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 48, November 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substitution of K with Ba in K3SbSe4 (K3&#8722;2xBaxSbSe4) not only incorporates K vacancies to the system but also leads to a trigonal to cubic phase transition. K3&#8722;2xBaxSbSe4 (x = 0.4) exhibits a maximum conductivity of 0.1 mS cm&#8722;1 at 40 &#176;C and serves as a separator in K&#8211;O2 batteries, effectively safeguarding the potassium metal anode against corrosion caused by oxygen.








Abstract
Developing K&#8208;ion conducting solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) plays a critical role in the safe implementation of potassium batteries. In this work, a chalcogenide&#8208;based potassium ion SSE is reported, K3SbSe4, which adopts a trigonal structure at room temperature. Single&#8208;crystal structural analysis reveals a trigonal&#8208;to&#8208;cubic phase transition at the low temperature of 50 &#176;C, which is the lowest among similar compounds and thus provides easy access to the cubic phase. The substitution of barium for potassium in K3SbSe4 leads to the creation of potassium vacancies, expansion of lattice parameters, and a transformation from a trigonal phase to a cubic phase. As a result, the maximum conductivity of K3&#8722;2xBaxSbSe4 reaches around 0.1 mS cm&#8722;1 at 40 &#176;C for K2.2Ba0.4SbSe4, which is over two orders of magnitude higher than that of undoped K3SbSe4. This novel SSE is successfully employed in a K&#8211;O2 battery operating at room temperature where a polymer&#8208;laminated K2.2Ba0.4SbSe4 pellet serves as a separator between the oxygen cathode and the potassium metal anode. Effective protection of the K metal anode against corrosion caused by O2 is demonstrated.

         <title>Molecular Heptazine&#8211;Triazine Junction over Carbon Nitride Frameworks for Artificial Photosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 48, November 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction of internal molecular heptazine/triazine junction over crystalline carbon nitride is a novel finding for efficient photocatalytic H2O2 evolution through a 2e&#8210; oxygen reduction reaction route owing to the enhanced built&#8208;in electric field associated with long&#8208;lived trap states. The photocatalytic system achieves several breakthroughs in charge transfer, catalyst&#8208;specific activity, and organic synthesis.








Abstract
Revealing the photocatalytic mechanism between various junctions and catalytic activities has become a hotspot in photocatalytic systems. Herein, an internal molecular heptazine/triazine (H/T) junction in crystalline carbon nitride (HTCN) is constructed and devoted to selective two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) for efficient hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production.

&lt;p&gt;The construction of internal molecular heptazine/triazine junction over crystalline carbon nitride is a novel finding for efficient photocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution through a 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8210;&lt;/sup&gt; oxygen reduction reaction route owing to the enhanced built-in electric field associated with long-lived trap states. The photocatalytic system achieves several breakthroughs in charge transfer, catalyst-specific activity, and organic synthesis.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revealing the photocatalytic mechanism between various junctions and catalytic activities has become a hotspot in photocatalytic systems. Herein, an internal molecular heptazine/triazine (H/T) junction in crystalline carbon nitride (HTCN) is constructed and devoted to selective two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR) for efficient hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) production. In-situ X-ray diffraction spectra under various temperatures authenticate the successful formation of molecular H/T junction in HTCN during the calcining process rather than physically mixing. The increased surface photovoltage and transient photovoltage signals, and the decreased exciton binding energy undoubtably elucidate that an obvious increasement of carrier density and diffusion capability of photogenerated electrons are realized over HTCN. Additionally, the analyses of in situ photoirradiated Kelvin probe force microscopy and femto-second transient absorption spectra reveal the successful construction of the strong internal built-in-electric field and the existence of the majority of long-lived shallow trapped electrons associated with molecular H/T junction over HTCN, respectively. Benefiting from these, the photocatalytic results exhibit an incredible improvement (96.5-fold) for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production.

         <dc:description>
The concept of electron effect is introduced into energy storage materials and eight one&#8208;dimensional nickel&#8208;based salicylic acid complexes are prepared by ligand engineering. Changes in the coordination environment in complexes are explored based on the electron&#8208;giving ability of the substituents, enabling the regulation of the conductivity of the materials.








Abstract
The integration of electronic effects into complexes for the construction of novel materials has not yet attracted significant attention in the field of energy storage. In the current study, eight one&#8208;dimensional (1D)&#160;nickel&#8208;based salicylic acid &#160;complexes (Ni&#8208;XSAs, X = pH, pMe, pMeO, mMe, pBr, pCl, pF, and pCF3), are prepared by ligand engineering. The coordination environments in the Ni&#8211;XSAs are explored using X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy. The charge transfer of the complexes is modulated according to the difference in the electron&#8208;donating ability of the substituents, in combination with frontier orbital theory. Furthermore, density functional theory&#160;is used to investigate the effect of the substituent position on the electronic properties of the complexes. Ni&#8208;mMeSA exhibits better electrical conductivity than Ni&#8208;pMeSA. The electrochemical performance of Ni&#8208;mMeSA as an aqueous battery cathode is remarkably improved with a maximum energy density of 0.30 mWh cm&#8722;2 (125&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1) and a peak power density of 33.72&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 (14.03&#160;kW kg&#8722;1). This study provides ideas for the application of new coordination chemistry in the field of energy materials science.

         <title>The Secret of Nanoarrays toward Efficient Electrochemical Water Splitting: A Vision of Self&#8208;Dynamic Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 48, November 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enhancing effect of self&#8208;dynamic electrolyte flow on the detachment of gas bubbles in nanoarray structures is investigated. By passing through voids and channels within the nanoarray, the flow field can bypass shielding effects and directly apply shear force to gas bubbles, leading to their rapid detachment and release for improved gas evolution reactions.








Abstract
Nanoarray electrocatalysts with unique advantage of facilitating gas bubble detachment have garnered significant interest in gas evolution reactions (GERs). Existing research is largely based on a static hypothesis, assuming that buoyancy is the only driving force for the release of bubbles during GERs. However, this hypothesis overlooks the effect of the self&#8208;dynamic electrolyte flow, which is induced by the release of mature bubbles and helps destabilize and release the smaller, immature bubbles nearby. Herein, the enhancing effect of self&#8208;dynamic electrolyte flow on nanoarray structures is examined. Phase&#8208;field simulations demonstrate that the flow field of electrode with arrayed surface focuses shear force directly onto the gas bubble for efficient detachment, due to the flow could pass through voids and channels to bypass the shielding effect. The flow field therefore has a more substantial impact on the arrayed surface than the nanoscale smooth surface in terms of reducing the critical bubble size. To validate this, superaerophobic ferrous&#8208;nickel sulfide nanoarrays are fabricated and employed for water splitting, which display improved efficiency for GERs. This study contributes to understanding the influence of self&#8208;dynamic electrolyte on GERs and emphasizes that it should be considered when designing and evaluating nanoarray electrocatalysts.

         <title>Reductant Engineering in Stable and High&#8208;Quality Tin Perovskite Single Crystal Growth for Heterojunction X&#8208;Ray Detectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 48, November 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tin perovskite has attracted much attention due to its smaller bandgap, while the instability of Sn2+ limits the tin perovskite single crystal growth under ambient conditions. Oxalic acid, serving as a reductant, is proved&#160;to be suitable for the solution growth of high&#8208;quality tin perovskite single crystals under ambient air, inhibiting oxidation, reducing defects, and improving device performance.








Abstract
Tin perovskites have emerged as a promising alternative material to address the toxicity of lead perovskites and the low bandgap of around 1.1&#160;eV is also compatible with tandem solar cell applications. Nevertheless, the optoelectronic performance of solution&#8208;processed tin perovskite single&#8208;crystal counterparts still lags behind because of the tin instability under ambient conditions during crystal growth and limited reductants to protect the Sn2+ ions from oxidation. Here, the reductant engineering to grow high&#8208;quality tin perovskite single crystals under ambient conditions is studied. Oxalic acid (H2C2O4) serves as an excellent reductant and sacrificial agent to protect Sn2+ ions in methanol due to its suitable redox potential of &#8722;0.49&#160;V, and the CO2 as the oxidation product in the gas state can be easily separated from the solution. The FPEA2SnI4 single crystal grown by this strategy exhibits low trap density perovskite surface by constructing an FPEA2PbI4&#8208;FPEA2SnI4 (FPI&#8208;FSI) single crystal heterojunction for X&#8208;ray detection. An improved X&#8208;ray sensitivity of 1.7 &#215; 105 &#181;C Gy&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 is realized in the heterojunction device, outperforming the control FPEA2PbI4 counterpart.

         <title>Injection&#8208;on&#8208;Skin Granular Adhesive for Interactive Human&#8211;Machine Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 48, November 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
For injection&#8208;on&#8208;skin human machine interfacing, strain&#8208;sensitive granular adhesives are reported in this work. The adhesives consist of hyaluronic acid hydropellets as a core and tissue&#8208;adhesive catecholamine layers as a shell, which are inspired by the core&#8211;shell architectures of natural basil seeds. On the basis of the materials with great on&#8208;skin writability, ionic&#8208;electrical conductivity, and sensitive resistance changes, stable human&#8211;metaverse interfacing is achieved.








Abstract
Realization of interactive human&#8211;machine interfaces (iHMI) is improved with development of soft tissue&#8208;like strain sensors beyond hard robotic exosuits, potentially allowing cognitive behavior therapy and physical rehabilitation for patients with brain disorders. Here, this study reports on a strain&#8208;sensitive granular adhesive inspired by the core&#8211;shell architectures of natural basil seeds for iHMI as well as human&#8211;metaverse interfacing. The granular adhesive sensor consists of easily fragmented hydropellets as a core and tissue&#8208;adhesive catecholamine layers as a shell, satisfying great on&#8208;skin injectability, ionic&#8208;electrical conductivity, and sensitive resistance changes through reversible yet robust cohesion among the hydropellets. Particularly, it is found that the ionic&#8208;electrical self&#8208;doping of the catecholamine shell on hydrosurfaces leads to a compact ion density of the materials. Based on these physical and electrical properties of the sensor, it is demonstrated that successful iHMI integration with a robot arm in both real and virtual environments enables robotic control by finger gesture and haptic feedback.

     alt="Injection-on-Skin Granular Adhesive for Interactive Human&#8211;Machine Interface"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For injection-on-skin human machine interfacing, strain-sensitive granular adhesives are reported in this work. The adhesives consist of hyaluronic acid hydropellets as a core and tissue-adhesive catecholamine layers as a shell, which are inspired by the core&#8211;shell architectures of natural basil seeds. On the basis of the materials with great on-skin writability, ionic-electrical conductivity, and sensitive resistance changes, stable human&#8211;metaverse interfacing is achieved.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realization of interactive human&#8211;machine interfaces (iHMI) is improved with development of soft tissue-like strain sensors beyond hard robotic exosuits, potentially allowing cognitive behavior therapy and physical rehabilitation for patients with brain disorders. Here, this study reports on a strain-sensitive granular adhesive inspired by the core&#8211;shell architectures of natural basil seeds for iHMI as well as human&#8211;metaverse interfacing. The granular adhesive sensor consists of easily fragmented hydropellets as a core and tissue-adhesive catecholamine layers as a shell, satisfying great on-skin injectability, ionic-electrical conductivity, and sensitive resistance changes through reversible yet robust cohesion among the hydropellets. Particularly, it is found that the ionic-electrical self-doping of the catecholamine shell on hydrosurfaces leads to a compact ion density of the materials. Based on these physical and electrical properties of the sensor, it is demonstrated that successful iHMI integration with a robot arm in both real and virtual environments enables robotic control by finger gesture and haptic feedback. This study expresses benefits of using granular hydrogel-based strain sensors for implementing on-skin writable bioelectronics and their bridging into the metaverse world.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pseudomorphic Synthesis of Monodisperse Afterglow Carbon Dot&#8208;Doped SiO2 Microparticles for Photonic Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 48, November 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is reported that the pseudomorphic transformation of SiO2 microparticles (MPs) allows for effective carbon dots doping, leading to the generation of green afterglow of the resultant MPs. The afterglow MPs could be rationally fabricated to photonic crystals, which exhibit angle&#8208;dependent structural color, blue luminescence, and time&#8208;dependent green afterglow after the cessation of UV excitation.








Abstract
Synthesizing monodisperse afterglow microparticles (MPs) is crucial for creating photonic crystal (PC) platforms with multiple optical states for optoelectronics. However, achieving high uniformity in both size and morphology is challenging for inorganic afterglow MPs using conventional methods. In this contribution, a novel approach for the synthesis of carbon dot (CD)&#8208;doped SiO2 MPs with tunable afterglow properties and size distributions is reported. These mechanism studies suggest that the pseudomorphic transformation of SiO2 MPs enables CD doping, providing a hydrogen bond&#8208;enriched environment for triplet state stabilization, which generates green afterglow while retaining the uniformity in size and morphology of the parent SiO2 MPs. Furthermore, the utility of CD&#8208;doped SiO2 MPs in the fabrication of rationally designed PC patterns is shown using a combined consecutive dip&#8208;coating and laser&#8208;assisted etching strategy. The pattern displays multiple optical responses under different lighting conditions, including angle&#8208;dependent structural colors and blue luminescence under daylight and upon 365&#8208;nm irradiation, respectively, as well as time&#8208;dependent green afterglow after ceasing UV excitation. The findings pave the way for further controlling the dynamics of spontaneous emissions by PCs to enable complicated optical states for advanced photonics.

         <title>Transparent Recombination Electrode with Dual&#8208;Functional Transport and Protective Layer for Efficient and Stable Monolithic Perovskite/Organic Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 48, November 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly conductive and transparent indium tin oxide is introduced by sputtering as recombination electrode for tandem solar cells (TSCs), and dual&#8208;functional C1 is employed as both transport and protective layer to avoid damaging the underlying material during sputtering and enhance electron transport. Monolithic perovskite/organic TSC with high power conversion efficiency&#160;of 24.07% and excellent stability is demonstrated.








Abstract
Rational selection and design of recombination electrodes (RCEs) are crucial to enhancing the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of monolithic tandem solar cells (TSCs). Sputtered indium tin oxide (ITO) with high conductivity and excellent transmittance is introduced as RCE in perovskite/organic TSCs. To prevent high&#8208;energy ITO particles destroy the underlying material during sputtering, dual&#8208;functional transport and protective layer (C1) is employed. The styryl group in C1 can be thermally crosslinked to serve as a sputtering protective layer. Meanwhile, the conjugated phenanthroline skeleton in C1 shows high electron mobility and hole blocking capability to promote the electron transport process at the interfaces and effectively reduce charge accumulation. Monolithic perovskite/organic TSC with high PCE of 24.07% and excellent stability is demonstrated by stacking a 1.77&#160;eV bandgap perovskite layer and a 1.35&#160;eV bandgap organic active layer. This strategy provides new insights for overcoming the fundamental efficiency limits of single&#8208;junction devices and promotes the further development of TSC devices.

         <title>Nonvolatile Memory Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 48, November 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new concept of nonvolatile memory organic light&#8208;emitting transistor (OLET) achieving by ferroelectric polymer is proposed for improving the integration density of pixel circuits of organic display. The performances of proposed device are greatly improved through interfacial modification approach. The integration of nonvolatile memory, switching and light&#8208;emitting functions within the ferroelectric OLET opens a different avenue toward on&#8208;chip advanced display technologies.








Abstract
In the field of active&#8208;matrix organic light emitting display (AMOLED), large&#8208;size and ultra&#8208;high&#8208;definition AMOLED applications have escalated the demand for the integration density of driver chips. However, as Moore's Law approaches the limit, the traditional technology of improving integration density that relies on scaling down device dimension is facing a huge challenge. Thus, developing a multifunctional and highly integrated device is a promising route for improving the integration density of pixel circuits. Here, a novel nonvolatile memory ferroelectric organic light&#8208;emitting transistor (Fe&#8208;OLET) device which integrates the switching capability, light&#8208;emitting capability and nonvolatile memory function into a single device is reported. The nonvolatile memory function of Fe&#8208;OLET is achieved through the remnant polarization property of ferroelectric polymer, enabling the device to maintain light emission at zero gate bias. The reliable nonvolatile memory operations are also demonstrated. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept device optimized through interfacial modification approach exhibits 20 times improved field&#8208;effect mobility and five times increased luminance. The integration of nonvolatile memory, switching and light&#8208;emitting capabilities within Fe&#8208;OLET provides a promising internal&#8208;storage&#8208;driving paradigm, thus creating a new pathway for deploying storage capacitor&#8208;free circuitry to improve the pixel aperture ratio and the integration density of circuits toward the on&#8208;chip advanced display applications.

         <title>A Targeted Exosome Therapeutic Confers Both CfDNA Scavenging and Macrophage Polarization for Ameliorating Rheumatoid Arthritis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 48, November 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel therapeutic MEX+cP is constructed by utilizing M2 macrophage&#8208;derived exosome as a chassis, which is modified with oligolysine and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)&#8208;cleavable polyethylene glycol. After intravenous injection into a collagen&#8208;induced arthritis (CIA) animal model, MEX+cP enriches at inflamed joints, wherein MMP cleavage exposes MEX+ to exert both cfDNA scavenging and M1&#8208;to&#8208;M2 polarization for efficiently ameliorating CIA.








Abstract
Only a minority of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients achieve disease remission, so the exploration of additional pathogenic factors and the development of new therapeutics are needed. Here, strong correlations among the cell&#8208;free DNA (cfDNA) level and the inflammatory response in clinical synovial fluid samples and RA disease activity are discovered. The important role of cfDNA in disease development in a collagen&#8208;induced arthritis (CIA) murine model is also demonstrated. Building on these findings, a novel therapeutic based on anti&#8208;inflammatory (M2) macrophage&#8208;derived exosomes as chassis, that are modified with both oligolysine and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)&#8208;cleavable polyethylene glycol (PEG) on the membrane, is developed. After intravenous injection, PEG&#8208;enabled prolonged circulation and C&#9472;C motif chemokine ligand&#8208;directed accumulation together result in enrichment at inflamed joints. Following subsequent MMP cleavage, the positively charged oligolysine is exposed for cfDNA scavenging, while exosomes induce M2 polarization. By using a classical CIA murine model and a newly established CIA canine model, it is demonstrated that the rationally designed exosome therapeutic substantially suppresses inflammation in joints and provides strong chondroprotection and osteoprotection, revealing its potential for effective CIA amelioration.

         <title>Bioactivable STING Nanoagonists to Synergize NIR&#8208;II Mild Photothermal Therapy Primed Robust and Long&#8208;Term Anticancer Immunity</title>

An extracellular matrix anchoring stimulator of interferon genes agonist&#8208;based photoimmunothernostic nanomedicine is developed, which can be activated by NIR&#8208;II fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging&#8208;guided mild photothermal therapy&#8208;induced neutrophilic inflammation. In orthotopic breast tumors, this strategy leads to the mice regaining tumor&#8208;free survival of at least 2 months. In addition, the immune&#8208;mediated abscopal effect shows inhibition of the distant solid tumor growth.








Abstract
Pharmacological activation of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway has become a promising strategy for cancer immunotherapy. However, the insufficient tumorous accumulation, rapid clearance, and short duration of drug efficacy in the tumor microenvironment of small structural STING agonists greatly compromise the therapeutic efficacy. Herein, a tumorous extracellular matrix (ECM) is presented anchoring STING agonist&#8208;based photoimmunothernostic nanomedicine (SAPTN) that can be activated by mild&#8208;temperature photothermal therapy (mild PTT) induced neutrophilic inflammation. The SAPTN owns second window near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) photonics properties fitting for NIR&#8208;II fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging&#8208;guided cancer therapy. The aggregates SAPTN targeting to the ECM provide slow and continuous release of potent STING agonists diABZIs. The mild PTT and long&#8208;lasting STING agonists released in the ECM synergistically&#160;prime systematic, robust, and long&#8208;term anticancer immunity. In a tumor model, this approach leads to complete tumor eradication in about 100% of mice with orthotopic breast tumors, and the mice regained tumor&#8208;free survival of at least 2 months. In addition, the immune&#8208;mediated abscopal effect shows inhibition of the distant solid tumor growth by intratumoral administration of SAPTN with laser irradiation. Overall, this approach represents a generalized photoactivable nanomedicine to prime anticancer immunity for improved cancer theranostics.

         <title>Scaling&#8208;Up Insights for Zinc&#8211;Air Battery Technologies Realizing Reversible Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 48, November 28, 2023. </description>

Scalable insights of zinc batteries for designing robust Zn&#8208;metal anodes with compatible preferred orientations are presented. Half&#8208; and full&#8208;cells performances are evaluated with commercial standards to compete with lithium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Zinc&#8211;air battery (ZAB) technology is considered one of the promising candidates to complement the existing lithium&#8208;ion batteries for future large&#8208;scale high&#8208;energy&#8208;storage demands. The scientific literature reveals many efforts for the ZAB chemistries, materials design, and limited accounts for cell design principles with apparently superior performances for liquid and solid&#8208;state electrolytes. However, along with the difficulty of forming robust solid&#8208;electrolyte interphases, the discrepancy in testing methods and assessment metrics severely challenges the realistic evaluation/comparison and commercialization of ZABs. Here, strategies to formulate reversible zinc anodes are proposed and specific cell&#8208;level energy metrics (100&#8722;500&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1) and realistic long&#8208;cycling operations are realized. Stabilizing anode/electrolyte interfaces results in a cumulative capacity of 25 Ah cm&#8722;2 and Coulomb efficiency of &gt;99.9% for 5000 plating/stripping cycles. Using 1&#8211;10 Ah scale (&#8776;500&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at cell level) solid&#8208;state zinc&#8211;air pouch cells, scale&#8208;up insights for Ah&#8208;level ZABs that can progress from lab&#8208;scale research to practical production are also offered.

         <title>An Ultra&#8208;Thin MXene Film for Multimodal Sensing of Neuroelectrical Signals with Artifacts Removal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 48, November 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;thin MXene film is crosslinked with PEDOT: PSS, resulting in a more stable, conductive, and transparent electrode that can conformably attached on skin and neural surfaces, and accurately detect very weak signals. Together with other imaging techniques, they can study brain activity in a specific cognitive task, demonstrating multimodal sensing ability of neuroelectrical signals without artifacts.








Abstract
Neuroelectrical signals transmitted onto the skin tend to decay to an extremely weak level, making them highly susceptible to interference from the environment and body movement. Meanwhile, for comprehensively understanding cognitive nerve conduction, multimodal sensing of neural signals, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional near&#8208;infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), is highly required. Previous metal or polymer conductors cannot either provide a seamless on&#8208;skin feature for accurate sensing of neuroelectrical signals or be compatible with multimodal imaging techniques without opto&#8208; and magnet&#8208; artifacts. Herein, a &#8776;20&#160;nm thick MXene film that is able to simultaneously detect electrophysiological signals and perform imaging by MRI and fNIRS with high fidelity is reported. The ultrathin film is made of crosslinked Ti3C2Tx film via poly (3,4&#8208;ethylene dioxythiophene): polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:&#160;PSS), showing a record high electroconductivity and transparency combination (11&#160;000&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1@89%). Among them, PEDOT: PSS not only plays a cross&#8208;linking role to stabilize MXene film but also shortens the interlayer distance for effective charge transfer and high transparency. Thus, it can achieve a low interfacial impedance with skin or neural surfaces for accurate recording of electrophysiological signals with low motion artifacts. Besides, the high transparency originating from the ultrathin feature leads to good compatibility with fNIRS and MRI without optical and magnetic artifacts, enabling multimodal cognitive neural monitoring during prolonged use.

         <title>Ultrahigh&#8208;Speed Aqueous Copper Electrodes Stabilized by Phosphorylated Interphase</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 48, November 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;cost and reliable in situ phosphate interphase engineering implements on aqueous copper metal electrodes. Robust interphase enables ultrahigh current shocks up to 100 mA cm&#8722;2, and brings at least an order of magnitude improvement in cycling stability for symmetric cells and full batteries, representing exciting possibilities for realizing practically aqueous metal electrodes.








Abstract
High&#8208;energy metal anodes for large&#8208;scale reversible batteries with inexpensive and nonflammable aqueous electrolytes promise the capability of supporting higher current density, satisfactory lifetime, nontoxicity, and low&#8208;cost commercial manufacturing, yet remain out of reach due to the lack of reliable electrode&#8211;electrolyte interphase engineering. Herein, in situ formed robust interphase on copper metal electrodes (CMEs) induced by a trace amount of potassium dihydrogen phosphate (0.05&#160;m in 1&#160;m CuSO4&#8211;H2O electrolyte) to fulfill all aforementioned requirements is demonstrated. Impressively, an unprecedented ultrahigh&#8208;speed copper plating/stripping capability is achieved at 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2&#160;for over 12&#160;000 cycles, corresponding to an accumulative areal capacity up to tens of times higher than previously reported CMEs. The use of solid&#8208;electrolyte interface&#8208;protection strategy brings at least an order of magnitude improvement in cycling stability for symmetric cells (Cu||Cu, 2800&#160;h) and full batteries with CMEs using either sulfur cathodes (S||Cu, 1000 cycles without capacity decay) or zinc anodes (Cu||Zn with all&#8208;metal electrodes, discharge voltage &#8776;1.02&#160;V). The comprehensive analysis reveals that the hydrophilic phosphate&#8208;rich interphase nanostructures homogenize copper&#8208;ion deposition and suppress nucleation overpotential, enabling dendrite&#8208;free CMEs with sustainability and ability to tolerate unusual&#8208;high power densities. The findings represent an&#160;elegant&#160;forerunner&#160;toward the promising goal of metal electrode applications.

Four solution&#8208;processable V&#8208;shaped hybrid local and charge transfer emitters are synthesized and their photoluminescence ranges from pure blue to ultra&#8208;deep&#8208;blue. The solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes all achieve maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of higher than 8%, wherein the device based on 4&#697;,5&#697;&#8208;bis(4&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)phenyl)spiro[fluorene&#8208;9,2&#697;&#8208;imidazole] merits a record&#8208;high EQEmax of 10.40% and an ultra&#8208;deep&#8208;blue Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage coordinate of (0.1579, 0.0387).








Abstract
It is always a great challenge to achieve high&#8208;efficiency solution&#8208;processed ultra&#8208;deep&#8208;blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with the Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) 1931 chromaticity coordinates matching the blue primary of Rec. International Telecommunication Union&#8208;Radiocommunication BT.2100, which specifies high dynamic range television image parameters. Inspired by hybrid local and charge transfer (HLCT) excited state emitters improving exciton utilization through high&#8208;lying reverse intersystem crossing, here, a series of high&#8208;performance blue emitters by a V&#8208;shaped symmetric donor (D)&#8211;&#960;&#8211;acceptor (A)&#8211;&#960;&#8211;D design strategy are developed. Here, the large torsions and unstable bonds of D&#8211;A structures can be improved through &#960; bridges, and also the conjugation length and donor groups can be easily adjusted. The obtained emitters merit excellent photophysical and electrochemical properties, thermal stability, solution processibility, and HLCT excited state excellence. Results suggest that the OLEDs based on the obtained blue emitters all achieve high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of more than 8% with very low efficiency roll&#8208;off. In particular, the device based on 4&#697;,5&#697;&#8208;bis(4&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)phenyl)spiro[fluorene&#8208;9,2&#697;&#8208;imidazole] exhibits a satisfactory ultra&#8208;deep&#8208;blue emission (CIEx,y = 0.1579, 0.0387) and a record&#8208;high EQEmax (10.40%) among solution&#8208;processed HLCT OLEDs, which is very close to the record EQEmax of devices by vacuum vapor deposition technology.

         <title>Molecular Clogging Organogels with Excellent Solvent Maintenance, Adjustable Modulus, and Advanced Mechanics for Impact Protection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 48, November 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By exploiting the molecular clogging (MC) effect resulting from the size difference between the bulky solvent and the network mesh, a series of MC&#8208;Gels exhibit excellent stability, with continuously adjustable modulus (from 1.3GPa to 30kPa) are obtained. MC&#8208;Gels provide unique high damping factors up to 1.9 and have successfully demonstrated their outstanding performance in various impact protection applications.








Abstract
Inspired by mechanically interlocking supramolecular materials, exploiting the size difference between the bulky solvent and the cross&#8208;linked network mesh, a molecular clogging (MC) effect is developed to effectively inhibit solvent migration in organogels. A bulky solvent (branched citrate ester, BCE) with a molecular size above 1.4&#160;nm is designed and synthesized. Series of MC&#8208;Gels are prepared by in situ polymerization of crosslinked polyurea with BCE as the gel solvent. The MC&#8208;Gels are colorless, transparent, and highly homogeneous, show significantly improved stability than gels prepared with small molecule solvents. As solvent migration is strongly inhibited by molecular clogging, the solvent content of the gels can be precisely controlled, resulting in a series of MC&#8208;Gels with continuously adjustable mechanics. In particular, the modulus of MC&#8208;Gel can be regulated from 1.3&#160;GPa to 30&#160;kPa, with a variation of 43&#160;000 times. The molecular clogging effect also provides MC&#8208;Gels with unique high damping (maximum damping factor of 1.9), impact resistant mechanics (high impact toughness up to 40.68&#160;MJ m&#8722;3). By applying shatter protection to items including eggs and ceramic armor plates, the potential of MC&#8208;Gels as high strength, high damping soft materials for a wide range of applications is well demonstrated.

         <title>Step&#8208;Nucleation In Situ Self&#8208;Repair to Prepare Rollable Large&#8208;Area Ultrathin MOF Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 48, November 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A step&#8208;nucleation in situ self&#8208;repair strategy to fabricate rollable large&#8208;area (2400 cm2) ultrathin (210&#8211;300&#160;nm) zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) membranes is elucidated. Two spiral&#8208;wound membrane modules with an area of 4800 cm2 are prepared. Both the membranes and membrane modules show unprecedented high olefin gas permeance and good olefin/paraffin gas selectivity, thus promoting ZIF membrane practical applications.








Abstract
Ultrathin membranes with ultrahigh permeance and good gas selectivity have the potential to greatly decrease separation process costs, but it requires the practical preparation of large area membranes for implementation. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are very attractive for membrane gas separation applications. However, to date, the largest MOF membrane area reported in the literature is only about 100 cm2. In the present study, a new step&#8208;nucleation in situ self&#8208;repair strategy is proposed that enables the preparation of large&#8208;area (2400 cm2) ultrathin and rollable MOF membranes deposited on an inexpensive flexible polymer membrane support layer for the first time, combining a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)&#8210;metal&#8208;ion layer and a pure metal&#8208;ion layer. The main role of the pure metal&#8208;ion layer is to act as the main nucleation sites for MOF membrane growth, while the PVA&#8210;metal&#8208;ion layer acts as a slow&#8208;release metal&#8208;ion source, which supplements MOF crystal nucleation to repair any defects occurring. Membrane modules are necessary components for membrane applications, and spiral&#8208;wound modules are among the most common module formats that are widely applied in gas separation. A 4800 cm2 spiral&#8208;wound membrane module&#160;was successfully prepared, demonstrating the practical implementation of large&#8208;area MOF membranes.

Plasmonic Nanoparticles
In article number 2303595, Andreas Fery, Yuan Zhang, Chunhong Ye, and co&#8208;workers, report the realization of 3D chiral plasmonic structures through shape&#8208;morphing of responsive polymer&#8208;based origami. Upon self&#8208;rolling of the microsheets into microtubules, the original linearly assembled AuNS chains on the microsheets are transferred in to 3D helices, which indicates tunable circular dichroism signals over mode frequency, magnitude, and handedness.

Genetically Encoded Oligomerization
Protein&#8208;based optoelectronics is a novel field toward the development of eco&#8208;friendly materials, replacing non&#8208;sustainable elements while maintaining device figures&#8208;of&#8208;merit. However, such materials are not stable under device fabrication and operation conditions. In article number 2303993, Juan Pablo Fuenzalida&#8208;Werner, Rub&#233;n D. Costa, and co&#8208;workers report a genetically encoded macro&#8208;oligomerization strategy that enables versatile, electrostatically controlled protein&#8211;protein interactions, ensuring the protein stability in non&#8208;native environments and stressful conditions, significantly enhancing the performance of protein&#8208;lighting devices.

4D Printing
In article number 2303681, Sung Jea Park, Moonwoo La, Dongwhi Choi, and co&#8208;workers report a hybrid droplet&#8208;based electricity generator (HDEG) that is simply fabricated by using mechanically guided 4D printing. The convergence of the droplet&#8208;based electricity generator and the solid&#8211;solid triboelectric nanogenerator that make up the HDEG allows more electrical energy to be harvested from a single droplet. This approach may provide new guidelines for the development of droplet&#8208;based energy harvesters, whereby electrical energy is efficiently collected from the ubiquitous droplets.

Biomass Electrooxidation
Ni&#8208;based hydroxides are promising electrocatalysts for biomass oxidation reactions, supplanting the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) while producing value&#8208;added chemicals. In article number 2305573, Nicholas M. Bedford, Yuwei Yang, and co&#8208;workers use catalyst engineering strategies for markedly improving selectivity toward biomass oxidation reactions versus the OER. This readily translatable approach can provide pathways for future selective biomass electrooxidation reactions.

         <title>Switching of Perpendicular Magnetization by Spin&#8211;Orbit Torque</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 48, November 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrical switching of perpendicular magnetization is key for the development of fast, dense, reliable magnetic memory, and computing technologies. Here is a focused review of the advances and challenges in the understanding of devices of switching of perpendicular magnetization by spin&#8211;orbit torques toward the goal of energy&#8208;efficient, dense, fast perpendicular spin&#8211;orbit torque applications.








Abstract
Magnetic materials with strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy are of great interest for the development of nonvolatile magnetic memory and computing technologies due to their high stabilities at the nanoscale. However, electrical switching of such perpendicular magnetization in an energy&#8208;efficient, deterministic, scalable manner has remained a big challenge. This problem has recently attracted enormous efforts in the field of spintronics. Here, recent advances and challenges in the understanding of the electrical generation of spin currents, the switching mechanisms and the switching strategies of perpendicular magnetization, the switching current density by spin&#8211;orbit torque of transverse spins, the choice of perpendicular magnetic materials are reviewed, and the progress in prototype perpendicular SOT memory and logic devices toward the goal of energy&#8208;efficient, dense, fast perpendicular spin&#8211;orbit torque applications is summarized.

         <title>Research Progress in Donor&#8722;Acceptor Type Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 48, November 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the influence of structure on the performance of donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8722;A) type covalent organic frameworks (COFs) in terms of linkage bonds and proposes various functionalization strategies to construct stable, high carrier transport and excellent optical properties of D&#8722;A type COFs. Moreover, the applications of D&#8722;A type COFs in catalytic chemical reactions, photothermal therapy, and electronic devices are introduced.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are new organic porous materials constructed by covalent bonds, with the advantages of pre&#8208;designable topology, adjustable pore size, and abundant active sites. Many research studies have shown that COFs exhibit great potential in gas adsorption, molecular separation, catalysis, drug delivery, energy storage, etc. However, the electrons and holes of intrinsic COF are prone to compounding in transport, and the carrier lifetime is short. The donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8722;A) type COFs, which are synthesized by introducing D and A units into the COFs backbone, combine separated electron and hole migration pathway, tunable band gap and optoelectronic properties of D&#8722;A type polymers with the unique advantages of COFs and have made great progress in related research in recent years. Here, the synthetic strategies of D&#8722;A type COFs are first outlined, including the rational design of linkages and D&#8722;A units as well as functionalization approaches. Then the applications of D&#8722;A type COFs in catalytic reactions, photothermal therapy, and electronic materials are systematically summarized. In the final section, the current challenges, and new directions for the development of D&#8722;A type COFs are presented.

Abstract
Rechargeable batteries are of great significance for alleviating the growing energy crisis by providing efficient and sustainable energy storage solutions. However, the multiple issues associated with the diverse components in a battery system as well as the interphase problems greatly hinder their applications. Proteins and their subunits, peptides, and amino acids, are versatile biomolecules. Functional groups in different amino acids endow these biomolecules with unique properties including self&#8208;assembly, ion&#8208;conducting, antioxidation, great affinity to exterior species, etc. Besides, protein and its subunit materials can not only work in solid forms but also in liquid forms when dissolved in solutions, making them more versatile to realize materials engineering via diverse approaches. In this review, it is aimed to offer a comprehensive understanding of the properties of proteins and their subunits, and research progress of using these versatile biomolecules to address the engineering issues of various rechargeable batteries, including alkali&#8208;ion batteries, lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries, metal&#8211;air batteries, and flow batteries. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art advances in electrode, electrolyte, separator, binder, catalyst, interphase modification, as well as recycling of rechargeable batteries are involved, and the impacts of biomolecules on electrochemical properties are particularly emphasized.

         <title>Application of Conductive MOF in Zinc&#8208;Based Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 48, November 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have a wide range of applications in modern society as a high&#8208;performance organic material. Conductive MOFs (c&#8208;MOFs) have superior electrical conductivity compared with pristine MOFs, and thus can further improve the performance of Zn&#8208;based batteries.








Abstract
The use of conductive MOFs (c&#8208;MOFs) in zinc&#8208;based batteries has been a popular research direction. Zinc&#8208;based batteries are widely used with the advantages of high specific capacity and safety and stability, but they also face many problems. c&#8208;MOFs have excellent conductivity compared with other primitive MOFs, and therefore have better applications in zinc&#8208;based batteries. In this paper, the transfer mechanisms of the unique charges of c&#8208;MOFs: hop transport and band transport, respectively, are discussed and the way of electron transport is further addressed. Then, the various ways to prepare c&#8208;MOFs are introduced, among which solvothermal, interfacial synthesis, and postprocessing methods are widely used. In addition, the applications of c&#8208;MOFs are discussed in terms of their role and performance in different types of zinc&#8208;based batteries. Finally, the current problems of c&#8208;MOFs and the prospects for their future development are presented.

         <title>Recent Progress in Functional Nanomaterials towards the Storage, Separation, and Removal of Tritium</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 48, November 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tritium is a prime fuel to generate fusion power, but its storage and separation in pure form are major challenges in nuclear industries. This review discusses recent progress and main research trends in hydrogen isotope storage and separation while emphasizing tritium using metal hydrides, nanoporous zeolites, and metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and 2&#8208;D layered graphene, h&#8208;BN, and MXenes based on their diverse functionalities.








Abstract
Tritium is a sustainable next&#8208;generation prime fuel for generating nuclear energy through fusion reactions to fulfill the increasing global energy demand. Owing to the scarcity&#8211;high demand tradeoff, tritium must be bred inside a fusion reactor to ensure sustainability and must therefore be separated from its isotopes (protium and deuterium) in pure form, stored safely, and supplied on demand. Existing multistage isotope separation technologies exhibit low separation efficiency and require intensive energy inputs and large capital investments. Furthermore, tritium&#8208;contaminated heavy water constitutes a major fraction of nuclear waste, and accidents like the one at Fukushima Daiichi leave behind thousands of tons of diluted tritiated water, whose removal is beneficial from an environmental point of view. In this review, the recent progress and main research trends in hydrogen isotope storage and separation by focusing on the use of metal hydride (e.g., intermetallic, and high&#8208;entropy alloys), porous (e.g., zeolites and metal organic frameworks (MOFs)), and 2&#8208;D layered (e.g., graphene, hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN), and MXenes) materials to separate and store tritium based on their diverse functionalities are discussed. Finally, the challenges and future directions for implementing tritium storage and separation are summarized in the reviewed materials.

         <title>Two&#8208;dimensional Hierarchical Micro&#8208;barcodes With Expanded Storage Capacity for Optical Multiplex and Information Encryptionik</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The design of nanosegregated fluorescent tags/barcodes by geometrical patterning with precise dimensions and hierarchies could integrate multi&#8208;level optical information within one carrier and enhance micro&#8208;sized barcoding techniques for ultrahigh&#8208;density optical data storage and encryption. However, precise control of the spatial distribution in micro&#8208;/nano&#8208;sized matrices intrinsically limits the accessible barcoding applications in terms of material design and construction. In this study, crystallization forces are leveraged to enable a rapid, programmable molecular packing and rapid epitaxial growth of fluorescent units in 2D via crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (CDSA). We systematically explore the fluorescence encoding density, scalability, information storage capacity, and decoding techniques of the robust 2D polymeric barcoding platform. These results provide a theoretical and an experimental foundation for expanding the fluorescence storage capacity, which is a longstanding challenge in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art micro&#8208;barcoding techniques and establish a generalized and adaptable coding platform for high&#8208;throughput analysis and optical multiplexing.

         <title>A PD&#8208;L1&#8208;targeting Regulator for Metabolic Reprogramming to Enhance Glutamine Inhibition&#8208;mediated Synergistic Antitumor Metabolic And Immune Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Inhibition of glutamine metabolism in tumor cells can cause metabolic compensation&#8208;mediated glycolysis enhancement and PD&#8208;L1 upregulation&#8208;induced immune evasion, significantly limiting the therapeutic efficacy of glutamine inhibitors. Here, inspired by the specific binding of receptor and ligand, a PD&#8208;L1&#8208;targeting metabolism and immune regulator (PMIR) was constructed by decorating the glutaminase inhibitor (BPTES)&#8208;loading zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) with PD&#8208;L1&#8208;targeting peptides for regulating the metabolism within the tumor microenvironment (TME) to improve immunotherapy. At tumor sites, PMIR inhibited glutamine metabolism of tumor cells for elevating glutamine levels within the TME to improve the function of immune cells. Ingeniously, the accompanying PD&#8208;L1 upregulation on tumor cells caused self&#8208;amplifying accumulation of PMIR through PD&#8208;L1 targeting, while also blocking PD&#8208;L1, which had the effects of converting enemies into friends. Meanwhile, PMIR exactly offset the compensatory glycolysis, while disrupting the redox homeostasis in tumor cells via the cooperation of components of the ZIF and BPTES. These together caused immunogenic cell death of tumor cells and relieved PD&#8208;L1&#8208;mediated immune evasion, further reshaping the immunosuppressive TME and evoking robust immune responses to effectively suppress bilateral tumor progression and metastasis. This work proposed a rational strategy to surmount the obstacles in glutamine inhibition for boosting existing clinical treatments.

         <title>Stepless IR Chromism in Ti3C2Tx MXene Tuned by Interlayer Water Molecules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Real&#8208;time control over infrared (IR) radiation of objects is highly desired in a variety of areas such as personal thermal regulation and IR camouflage. This requires the dynamic modulation of IR emissivity in a stepless manner over a wide range (&gt;50%), which remains a daunting challenge. Here, we report an emissivity modulation phenomenon in stacked two&#8208;dimensional Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets, from 12% to 68% as the intercalation/discharging of water molecules within the interlayers. The intercalation of water molecules dynamically changes the electronic properties and the complex permittivity in IR frequencies of Ti3C2Tx. This emissivity modulation is a stepless and reversible process without the assistance of any external energy input. Furthermore, intercalating cellulose nanofibers into the Ti3C2Tx interlayers makes this dynamic process highly repeatable. Last, we demonstrate a sweat&#8208;responsive adaptive textile that can improve thermal comfort of human body under changes in metabolic rates and environmental conditions, showing great potential of this mechanism in passive on&#8208;demand radiation modulation.

Here, we report an emissivity modulation phenomenon in stacked two-dimensional Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; MXene nanosheets, from 12% to 68% as the intercalation/discharging of water molecules within the interlayers. The intercalation of water molecules dynamically changes the electronic properties and the complex permittivity in IR frequencies of Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;. This emissivity modulation is a stepless and reversible process without the assistance of any external energy input. Furthermore, intercalating cellulose nanofibers into the Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; interlayers makes this dynamic process highly repeatable. Last, we demonstrate a sweat-responsive adaptive textile that can improve thermal comfort of human body under changes in metabolic rates and environmental conditions, showing great potential of this mechanism in passive on-demand radiation modulation.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Rapid Surface Reconstruction in Air&#8208;Processed Perovskite Solar Cells by Blade Coating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Blade coating has been developed to be an essential technique for large&#8208;area fabrication of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, effective surface treatment of the perovskite layer, which is a critical step for improving PSC performance, remains challenges during blade coating due to the short interaction time between the modification solution and the perovskite layer, as well as the limited selection of available organic solvents. In this study, a novel modifier N, N&#8208;diphenylguanidine monohydrobromide (DPGABr) dissolved in acetonitrile (ACN) is blade&#8208;coated on the surface of a mixed perovskite film in air to reconstruct the perovskite surface in hundreds of milliseconds. We find that the solvent ACN rapidly dissolves organic iodide of the perovskite layer and leads to a PbI2&#8208;rich surface, providing reactive sites for DPGABr to form a thin DPGABr/PbI2 complex layer. This surface reconstruction can effectively passivate defects and induce n&#8208;type doping on the perovskite surface to facilitate electron transfer. The resultant devices show a relative enhancement of 15% in the average power conversion efficiency. More importantly, the devices with the surface reconstruction show outstanding long&#8208;term stability and the devices performances undergo negligible degradation even after one&#8208;year storage in air. This study presents a convenient and effective approach for improving the performance of blade&#8208;coated PSCs prepared in air.

         <title>Multilevel Gradient&#8208;Ordered Silicon Anode with Unprecedented Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
While cost&#8208;effective sodium&#8208;ion batteries with crystalline silicon anodes promise high theoretical capacities, they perform poorly because silicon stores sodium ineffectively (capacity &lt;40 mAh&#183;g&#8211;1). To address this issue, herein we adopted an atomic&#8208;order structural&#8208;design tactic for obtaining unique multilevel gradient&#8208;ordered silicon (MGO&#8208;Si) by simple electrochemical reconstruction. In&#8208;situ&#8208;formed short&#8208;range, medium&#8208;range, and long&#8208;range&#8208;ordered structures construct a stable MGO&#8208;Si, which contributes to favorable Na&#8208;Si interaction and fast ion diffusion channels. These characteristics afford a high reversible capacity (352.7 mAh g&#8211;1 at 50&#160;mA g&#8211;1) and stable cycling performance (95.2% capacity retention after 4000 cycles), exhibiting record values among those reported for pure silicon electrodes, which is expected to be an innovative alternative as anodes in SIBs. Sodium storage involves an adsorption&#8211;intercalation mechanism, and a stepwise construction strategy of gradient&#8208;ordered structure further improved the specific capacity (339.5 mAh g&#8211;1 at 100&#160;mA g&#8211;1). Reconstructed Si/C composites show a high reversible capacity of 449.5 mAh g&#8722;1, significantly better than most carbonaceous anodes. The universality of this design principle is demonstrated for other inert or low&#8208;capacity materials (micro&#8208;Si, SiO2, SiC, graphite, and TiO2), boosting their capacities by 1.5&#8211;6 times that of pristine materials, thereby providing new solution to facilitate sodium storage capability for better&#8208;performing battery designs.

Abstract
Enhancing electrocatalytic performance through structural and compositional engineering has attracted considerable attention. However, most materials only function as pre&#8208;catalysts, and convert into &#8220;real catalysts&#8221; during electrochemical reactions. Such transition involves dramatic structural and compositional changes and disrupts their designed properties. Herein, we developed for the first time a laser&#8208;ironing (LI) approach capable of in&#8208;situ forming a laser&#8208;ironing capping layer (LICL) on the Co&#8208;ZIF&#8208;L flakes. During the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process, the LICL sustains the leaf&#8208;like morphology and promotes the formation of OER&#8208;active Co3O4 nanoclusters with the highest activity and stability. In contrast, the pristine and conventional heat&#8208;treated Co&#8208;ZIF&#8208;L both collapse and transform to less active CoOOH. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations pinpoint the importance of the high spin (HS) states of Co ions and the narrowed band gap in Co3O4 nanoclusters. They enhance the OER activity by promoting spin&#8208;selected electron transport, effectively lowering the energy barrier, and realizing a spontaneous O2&#8208;releasing step that is the potential determining step in CoOOH. This study presents an innovative approach for modulating both structural and compositional evolutions of electrocatalysts during the reaction, sustaining stability with high performance during dynamic electrochemical reactions, and providing new pathways for facile and high&#8208;precision surface microstructure control.

         <title>Programming Anisotropic Functionality of 3d Microdenticles by Staggered&#8208;Overlapped and Multilayered Microarchitectures</title>

Abstract
Natural sharkskin features staggered&#8208;overlapped and multilayered architectures of riblet&#8208;textured anisotropic microdenticles, exhibiting drag reduction and providing a flexible yet strong armor. However, the artificial fabrication of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) sharkskin with these unique functionalities and mechanical integrity is a challenge using conventional techniques. In this study, we report on the facile microfabrication of multilayered 3D sharkskin through the magnetic actuation of polymeric composites and subsequent chemical shape fixation by casting thin polymeric films. The fabricated hydrophobic sharkskin, with geometric symmetry breaking, achieves anisotropic drag reduction in frontal and backward flow directions against the riblet&#8208;textured microdenticles. For mechanical integrity, hard&#8208;on&#8208;soft multilayered mechanical properties are realized by coating the polymeric sharkskin with thin layers of zinc oxide and platinum, which have higher hardness and recovery behaviors than the polymer. This multilayered hard&#8208;on&#8208;soft sharkskin exhibits friction anisotropy, mechanical robustness, and structural recovery. Furthermore, coating the MXene nanosheets provides the fabricated sharkskin with a low electrical resistance of &#8776;5.3 &#937;, which leads to high Joule heating (&#8776;229.9&#176;C at 2.75&#160;V). The proposed magnetomechanical actuation&#8208;assisted microfabrication strategy is expected to facilitate the development of devices requiring multifunctional microtextures.

         <title>Hydronium Intercalation Enables High Rate in Hexagonal Molybdate Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Rapid proton transport in solid&#8208;hosts promotes a new chemistry in achieving high&#8208;rate Faradaic electrodes. Exploring the possibility of hydronium intercalation is essential for advancing proton&#8208;based charge storage. Nevertheless, this is yet to be revealed. Herein, we report a new host of hexagonal molybdates, (A2O)x&#183;MoO3&#183;(H2O)y (A = Na+, NH4+), and demonstrate hydronium (de)intercalation with experiments. Hexagonal molybdates show a battery&#8208;type initial reduction followed by intercalation pseudocapacitance. Fast rate of 200 C (40 A g&#8722;1) and long lifespan of 30000 cycles are achieved in electrodes of monocrystals even over 200&#160;&#956;m. Solid&#8208;state NMR confirms hydronium intercalations, and operando measurements using electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance and synchrotron XRD disclose distinct intercalation behaviours in different electrolyte concentrations. Remarkably, characterizations of the cycled electrodes show nearly identical structures and suggest equilibrium products are minimally influenced by the extent of proton solvation. These results offer new insights into proton electrochemistry and will advance correlated high&#8208;power batteries and beyond.

Remarkably, characterizations of the cycled electrodes show nearly identical structures and suggest equilibrium products are minimally influenced by the extent of proton solvation. These results offer new insights into proton electrochemistry and will advance correlated high-power batteries and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Molecular Design of Layered Hybrid Silver Bismuth Bromine Single Crystal for Ultra&#8208;Stable X&#8208;Ray Detection with Record Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Nowadays, weak interlayer coupling and unclear mechanism in layered hybrid silver bismuth bromine (LH&#8208;AgBiBr) is the main reason for limiting its further enhanced X&#8208;ray detection sensitivity and stability. Herein, the design rules for LH&#8208;AgBiBr and its influence on X&#8208;ray detection performance were reported for the first time. Although shortening amine size could enhance interlayer coupling, its detection performance is severely hampered by its easier defect formation caused by enlarged micro strain. In contrast, an appropriate divalent amine design endowed the material with improved interlayer coupling and released micro strain, which benefits crystal stability and mechanical hardness. Another contribution is to increase material density and dielectric constant, thus enhancing X&#8208;ray absorption and carrier transport. Consequently, the optimized parallel device based on BDA2AgBiBr8 achieved a record sensitivity of 2638 &#956;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 and an ultra&#8208;low detection limit of 7.4 nGyair s&#8722;1, outperforming other reported LH&#8208;AgBiBr X&#8208;ray detectors. Moreover, the unencapsulated device displays remarkable anti&#8208;moisture, anti&#8208;thermal (&gt; 150&#730;C), and anti&#8208;radiation (&gt; 1000 Gyair) endurance. Eventually, high&#8208;resolution hard X&#8208;ray imaging was demonstrated by linear detector arrays under a benign dose rate (1.63 &#956;Gyair s&#8722;1) and low external bias (5&#160;V). Hence, our findings provide guidelines for future materials design and device optimization.

         <title>Revealing the Anion&#8208;Solvent Interaction for Ultralow Temperature Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Anion solvation (anion&#8208;solvent interaction) in nonaqueous electrolytes can largely change the electrochemical performance of the electrolytes, yet has been rarely investigated. Herein, three anions of bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (TFSI), bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (FSI), and derived asymmetric (fluorosulfonyl)(trifluoro&#8208;methanesulfonyl)imide (FTFSI) were systematically examined in a weakly Li+ cation solvating solvent of bis(3&#8208;fluoropropyl)ether (BFPE). In&#8208;situ liquid secondary ion mass spectrometry demonstrates that FTFSI&#8722; and FSI&#8722; anions are associated with BFPE solvent, while weak TFSI&#8722;/BFPE cluster signals are detected. Molecular modeling further reveals that the anion&#8208;solvent interaction is accompanied by the formation of H&#8208;bonding&#8208;like interactions. Anion solvation enhances the Li+ cation transfer number and reduces the organic component in solid electrolyte interphase, which enhances the Li plating/stripping Coulombic efficiency at a low temperature of &#8208;30&#160;&#176;C from 42.4% in TFSI&#8208;based electrolytes to 98.7% in 1.5&#160;M LiFTFSI and 97.9% in LiFSI&#8208;BFPE electrolytes. The anion&#8208;solvent interactions, especially asymmetric anion solvation also accelerate the Li+ desolvation kinetics. The 1.5&#160;M LiFTFSI&#8208;BFPE electrolyte with strong anion&#8208;solvent interaction enables LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811)||Li (20&#160;&#956;m) full cell with stable cyclability even under &#8208;40&#160;&#176;C, retaining over 92% of initial capacity (115 mAh/g, after 100 cycles). The anion&#8208;solvent interactions insights allow us to rational design the electrolyte for lithium metal batteries and beyond to achieve high performance.

         <title>Nearly Ideal Transparency with Artificially Designed Meta&#8208;Atoms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The ideal electromagnetic transparency refers to the ability of an object to remain scatteringless to any incoming waves, resulting in vacuum invisibility. However, natural solid substances can hardly be transparent in free space as they are responsive to external polarizations. Completely eliminating the polarization effect of an obstacle under arbitrary field illumination has been a long&#8208;standing scientific challenge. Here, we show that a subwavelength meta&#8208;atom can be nearly ideally transparent in the vacuum. The overall vacuum&#8208;like property of the meta&#8208;atom is achieved through judiciously designing its internal polarization and magnetization. Remarkably, any large&#8208;scale objects made by stacking the meta&#8208;atoms inherit the vacuum&#8208;like property and are scatteringless in free space. By both the simulations and experiments, the meta&#8208;atom's peculiar property is reasonably verified. The proposed meta&#8208;atoms are excellent candidates for a wide range of applications, such as perfect radar radomes, scatteringless walls, filtering devices, and self&#8208;stealth materials.

         <title>Modulating the Electronic Metal&#8722;Support Interactions to Anti&#8208;leaching Pt Single Atoms for Efficient Hydrosilylation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Modulating the electronic metal&#8208;support interaction (EMSI) of the single&#8208;atomic sites against leaching via microenvironment regulation is critical to achieving high activity and stability but remains challenging. Herein, we selectively confine Pt single atoms on CoFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) by three oxygen atoms around cation vacancy (Pt1/LDHV) or one oxygen atom at the regular surface (Pt1/LDH) via cation vacancy engineering. By characterizing the structural evolution of the obtained catalysts before and after vacancy construction and single&#8208;atom anchoring, we demonstrate how the microenvironments modulate the EMSI and the catalytic performance. Theoretical simulations further reveal a significantly enhanced EMSI effect by the three&#8208;coordinated Pt1 atoms on cation vacancies in Pt1/LDHV, which endows a more prominent anti&#8208;leaching feature than the one&#8208;coordinated ones on the regular surface. As a result, the Pt1/LDHV catalyst shows exceptional performance in anti&#8208;Markovnikov alkene hydrosilylation, with a turnover frequency of 1.3&#215;105 h&#8722;1. More importantly, the enhanced EMSI of Pt1/LDHV effectively prevented the leaching of Pt atom from the catalyst surface and can be recycled at least ten times with only a 3.4% loss of catalytic efficiency with minimal Pt leaching, and reach a high turnover number of 1.0&#215;106.

         <title>The Electrical Behaviors of Grain Boundaries in Polycrystalline Optoelectronic Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a systematic overview of the electrical properties of grain boundaries in polycrystalline optoelectronic materials and covers the impact of doping and passivation on carrier recombination and transport at grain boundaries. Through deliberate and rational manipulation of the grain boundaries, it is possible to achieve high&#8208;performance optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
Polycrystalline optoelectronic materials are widely used for photoelectric signal conversion and energy harvesting and play an irreplaceable role in the semiconductor field. As an important factor in determining the optoelectronic properties of polycrystalline materials, grain boundaries (GBs) are the focus of research. Particular emphases are placed on the generation and height of GB barriers, how carriers move at GBs, whether GBs act as carrier transport channels or recombination sites, and how to change the device performance by altering the electrical behaviors of GBs. This review introduces the evolution of GB theory and experimental observation history, classifies GB electrical behaviors from the perspective of carrier dynamics, and summarizes carrier transport state under external conditions such as bias and illumination and the related band bending. Then the carrier scattering at GBs and the electrical differences between GBs and twin boundaries are discussed. Last, the review describes how the electrical behaviors of GBs can be influenced and modified by treatments such as passivation or by consciously adjusting the distribution of grain boundary elements. By studying the carrier dynamics and the relevant electrical behaviors of GBs in polycrystalline materials, researchers can develop optoelectronics with higher performance.

         <title>Over 18% Efficiency Ternary Organic Solar Cells with 300&#160;nm Thick Active Layer Enabled by an Oligomeric Acceptor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ternary organic solar cells (OSCs) with high thickness tolerance are realized via introducing an oligomer DY&#8208;TF as third component. Upon addition of DY&#8208;TF, the crystallinity of the host blend is improved and a well&#8208;defined morphology with vertical phase separation is formed, yielding an efficiency of 18.23%, which represents the highest efficiency value for 300 nm&#8208;thick OSCs thus far.








Abstract
The development of high&#8208;efficiency thickness&#8208;insensitive organic solar cells (OSCs) is crucially important for the mass production of solar panels. However, increasing the active layer thickness usually induces a substantial loss in efficiency. Herein, a ternary strategy in which an oligomer DY&#8208;TF is incorporated into PM6:L8&#8208;BO system as a guest component is adopted to break this dilemma. The S&#183;&#183;&#183;F intramolecular noncovalent interactions in the backbone endow DY&#8208;TF with a high planarity. Upon the addition of DY&#8208;TF, the crystallinity of the blend is effectively improved, leading to increased charge carrier mobility, which is highly desirable in the fabrication of thick&#8208;film devices. As a result, thin&#8208;film PM6:L8&#8208;BO:DY&#8208;TF&#8208;based device (110&#160;nm) shows a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.13%. Impressively, when the active layer thickness increases to 300&#160;nm, an efficiency of 18.23% (certified as 17.8%) is achieved, representing the highest efficiency reported for 300 nm thick OSCs thus far. Additionally, blade&#8208;coated thick device (300&#160;nm) delivers a promising PCE of 17.38%. This work brings new insights into the construction of efficient OSCs with high thickness tolerance, showing great potential for roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll printing of large&#8208;area solar cells.

         <title>Ultrasound&#8208;Sensitive Intelligent Nanosystems: A Promising Strategy for the Treatment of Neurological Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review outlines promising advances in ultrasound therapy for neurological diseases. It discusses design strategies and diversification types for ultrasound&#8208;sensitive intelligent nanosystems (USINs). Biological applications of USINs&#8208;enhanced ultrasound for neurological disorders are also summarized. Rapid developments in this field are expected to facilitate precise and safe treatments for such diseases.








Abstract
Neurological diseases are a major global health challenge, affecting hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Ultrasound therapy plays an irreplaceable role in the treatment of neurological diseases due to its noninvasive, highly focused, and strong tissue penetration capabilities. However, the complexity of brain and nervous system and the safety risks associated with prolonged exposure to ultrasound therapy severely limit the applicability of ultrasound therapy. Ultrasound&#8208;sensitive intelligent nanosystems (USINs) are a novel therapeutic strategy for neurological diseases that bring greater spatiotemporal controllability and improve safety to overcome these challenges. This review provides a detailed overview of therapeutic strategies and clinical advances of ultrasound in neurological diseases, focusing on the potential of USINs&#8208;based ultrasound in the treatment of neurological diseases. Based on the physical and chemical effects induced by ultrasound, rational design of USINs is a prerequisite for improving the efficacy of ultrasound therapy. Recent developments of ultrasound&#8208;sensitive nanocarriers and nanoagents are systemically reviewed. Finally, the challenges and developing prospects of USINs are discussed in depth, with a view to providing useful insights and guidance for efficient ultrasound treatment of neurological diseases.

         <title>Breadmaking&#8208;Inspired Antioxidant Porous Yeast Microcarriers for Stem Cell Delivery in Diabetic Wound Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work represents an innovative application of breadmaking principle in the creation of porous microcarriers for adipose&#8208;derived stem cells (ADSCs) delivery (ADSC@YMC) to treat diabetic wound. Simultaneously, the release of glutathione (GSH) from the yeast imparts antioxidative qualities to the microcarriers, ultimately extending the viability and retention of ADSCs.








Abstract
Stem cell&#8208;based therapies have exhibited significant promise in the treatment of diabetic ulcers (DU). Nevertheless, enhancing the survival rate and functionality of transplanted stem cells poses a substantial challenge. In this study, inspired by the breadmaking process, yeast microcarriers (YMC) are devised as vehicles for stem cells to address these challenges. The fabrication of YMC involves the amalgamation of microfluidic emulsification with yeast&#8208;mediated fermentation, yielding microcarriers with outstanding biocompatibility, high porosity, and antioxidant activity. Adipose&#8208;derived stem cells (ADSCs) seeded onto YMC display remarkable cell viability and retain their cellular functions effectively. Additionally, YMC boast a rich glutathione content and exhibit remarkable ROS scavenging ability, thus shielding the ADSCs from oxidative stress. In vivo experiments further substantiate that ADSC@YMC implementation significantly lowered ROS levels in diabetic wounds, resulting in enhanced stem cell retention and improved angiogenesis, collagen deposition, and tissue regeneration. These results highlight the potential of ADSC@YMC as a promising platform for delivering stem cell in the treatment of diabetic wounds.

         <title>Nanomedicine Combats Drug Resistance in Lung Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the discovered drug resistance mechanisms for lung cancer chemotherapy, molecular targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and radiotherapy are introduced. Recent advances of organic, inorganic, and bio&#8208;derived nanomedicines for drug&#8208;resistant lung cancer treatment are summarized. The engineering design, customized delivery, current challenges, and clinical translation of nanomedicine for lung cancer are discussed.








Abstract
Lung cancer is the second most prevalent cancer and the leading cause of cancer&#8208;related death worldwide. Surgery, chemotherapy, molecular targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and radiotherapy are currently available as treatment methods. However, drug resistance is a significant factor in the failure of lung cancer treatments. Novel therapeutics have been exploited to address complicated resistance mechanisms of lung cancer and the advancement of nanomedicine is extremely promising in terms of overcoming drug resistance. Nanomedicine equipped with multifunctional and tunable physiochemical properties in alignment with tumor genetic profiles can achieve precise, safe, and effective treatment while minimizing or eradicating drug resistance in cancer. Here, this work reviews the discovered resistance mechanisms for lung cancer chemotherapy, molecular targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and radiotherapy, and outlines novel strategies for the development of nanomedicine against drug resistance. This work focuses on engineering design, customized delivery, current challenges, and clinical translation of nanomedicine in the application of resistant lung cancer.

A comprehensive review is provided on the application and key factors of hydrogen bond chemistry in various aqueous batteries, encompassing electrode materials, electrolytes, separators, and binders. Accurate insights are presented to utilize hydrogen bond chemistry in order to address a range of key factors that hinder electrochemical performance, aiming to drive the progress of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art aqueous batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous batteries are emerging as highly promising contenders for large&#8208;scale grid energy storage because of uncomplicated assembly, exceptional safety, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. The unique aqueous electrolyte with a rich hydrogen bond (HB) environment inevitably has a significant impact on the electrode materials and electrochemical processes. While numerous reviews have focused on the materials design and assembly of aqueous batteries, the utilization of HB chemistry is overlooked. Herein, instead of merely compiling recent advancements, this review presents a comprehensive summary and analysis of the profound implication exerted by HB on all components of the aqueous batteries. Intricate links between the novel HB chemistry and various aqueous batteries are ingeniously constructed within the critical aspects, such as self&#8208;discharge, structural stability of electrode materials, pulverization, solvation structures, charge carrier diffusion, corrosion reactions, pH sensitivity, water splitting, polysulfides shuttle, and H2S evolution. By adopting a vantage point that encompasses material design, binder and separator functionalization, electrolyte regulation, and HB optimization, a critical examination of the key factors that impede electrochemical performance in diverse aqueous batteries is conducted. Finally, insights are rendered properly based on HB chemistry, with the aim of propelling the advancement of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art aqueous batteries.

         <title>Type I Photosensitizer Targeting Glycans: Overcoming Biofilm Resistance by Inhibiting the Two&#8208;Component System, Quorum Sensing, and Multidrug Efflux</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A glycan&#8208;targeting type I photosensitizer is developed to fight against stubborn biofilms. ACR&#8208;DMP has high extracellular polymer penetrability and overcomes the hypoxic microenvironment, which therefore efficiently eradicates biofilm in vitro and in vivo. It not only changes the membrane potential homeostasis and the osmotic pressure balance, but also inhibits quorum sensing, two&#8208;component system, and efflux pump to conquer biofilm resistance.








Abstract
Stubborn biofilm infections pose serious threats to human health due to the persistence, recurrence, and dramatically magnified antibiotic resistance. Photodynamic therapy has emerged as a promising approach to combat biofilm. Nevertheless, how to inhibit the bacterial signal transduction system and the efflux pump to conquer biofilm recurrence and resistance remains a challenging and unaddressed issue. Herein, a boric acid&#8208;functionalized lipophilic cationic type I photosensitizer, ACR&#8208;DMP, is developed, which efficiently generates &#8226;OH to overcome the hypoxic microenvironment and photodynamically eradicates methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and biofilms. Furthermore, it not only alters membrane potential homeostasis and osmotic pressure balance due to its strong binding ability with plasma membrane but also inhibits quorum sensing and the two&#8208;component system, reduces virulence factors, and regulates the activity of the drug efflux pump attributed to the glycan&#8208;targeting ability, helping to prevent biofilm recurrence and conquer biofilm resistance. In vivo, ACR&#8208;DMP successfully obliterates MRSA biofilms attached to implanted medical catheters, alleviates inflammation, and promotes vascularization, thereby combating infections and accelerating wound healing. This work not only provides an efficient strategy to combat stubborn biofilm infections and bacterial multidrug resistance but also offers systematic guidance for the rational design of next&#8208;generation advanced antimicrobial materials.

         <title>Highly Crystalized MAPbX3 Perovskite Triangular Nanowire Arrays for Optoelectronic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Here, a facile fabrication approach for high&#8208;quality 1D perovskite triangular nanowire (TNW) array synthesis through space&#8208;confined effect was reported. A soft stamp containing 1D triangular linear array pattern was used to confine the MAPbX3 solution and to guide the growth of the nanowires along the prescribed direction with good crystallinity. The further constructed photodetectors based on the obtained MAPbI3 TNWs, which exhibit superior photoresponse properties with a responsivity of (125.2 &#177; 2.5) A W&#8722;1 and detectivity of (2.8 &#177; 0.8) &#215; 1013 Jones at the wavelength of 650 nm. The excellent performance is attributed to the highly crystalline TNW with optical anisotropy and a small asymptotic height, which reduces the probability of photon reflection and promotes carrier transport. More interestingly, the increased surface area of the triangular device can present superior flexibility after a couple of thousands of bending cycles. Furthermore, by fabricating 7 &#215; 7 photodetector arrays, the potential image sensor application was demonstrated. The perovskite nanowire fabrication approach is scalable and compatible with current semiconductor manufacturing, which indicates their great potential in broad applications.

         <title>Sweet but Challenging: Tackling the Complexity of GAGs with Engineered Tailor&#8208;Made Biomaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
((Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) play a crucial role in tissue homeostasis by regulating the activity and diffusion of bioactive molecules. Incorporating GAGs into biomaterials has emerged as a widely adopted strategy in medical applications, owing to their biocompatibility and ability to control the release of bioactive molecules. Nevertheless, immobilized GAGs on biomaterials can elicit distinct cellular responses compared to their soluble forms, underscoring the need to understand the interactions between GAG and bioactive molecules within engineered functional biomaterials. By controlling critical parameters such as GAG type, density, and sulfation, it becomes possible to precisely delineate GAG functions within a biomaterial context and to better mimic specific tissue properties, enabling tailored design of GAG&#8208;based biomaterials for specific medical applications. However, this requires access to pure and well&#8208;characterized GAG compounds, which remains challenging. This review focuses on different strategies for producing well&#8208;defined GAGs and explores high&#8208;throughput approaches employed to investigate GAG&#8211;growth factor interactions and to quantify cellular responses on GAG&#8208;based biomaterials. These automated methods hold considerable promise for improving our understanding of the diverse functions of GAGs. In perspectives; we encourage the scientific community to adopt a rational approach in designing GAG&#8208;based biomaterials, taking into account the in vivo properties of the targeted tissue for medical applications.))

         <title>Artificial Photosynthetic System with Spatial Dual Reduction Site Enabling Enhanced Solar Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Despite the potential of the S&#8208;scheme artificial photosynthetic system in driving photocatalytic hydrogen generation, conventional approaches tend to focus too heavily on a single reduction site. These systems still suffer poor redox ability and charge separation impairing the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel strategy of designing a double S&#8208;scheme system that leverages dual reduction sites, thereby preserving energetic photo&#8208;electrons and holes to enhance apparent quantum efficiency. In this work, we put forth a double S&#8208;scheme junction consisting of CdS nanospheres decorated with anatase TiO2 nanoparticles coupled with graphitic carbon nitride. The as&#8208;prepared catalyst exhibits a remarkable hydrogen evolution rate of 26.84&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and an apparent quantum efficiency as high as 40.2% at the wavelength of 365&#160;nm. This enhancement of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance is ascribed to the efficient separation and transportation induced by the double S&#8208;scheme. Supporting this, both theoretical calculations and comprehensive spectroscopy tests (both in&#8208;situ and ex&#8208;situ) affirm the efficient charge transportation across the catalyst interface. Moreover, substituting the reduction&#8208;type catalyst CdS with other similar sulfides like ZnIn2S4, ZnS, MoS2 and In2S3 further confirms the feasibility of the proposed double S&#8208;scheme configuration. Our findings provide a pathway to designing more effective double S&#8208;scheme artificial photosynthetic systems, opening up fresh perspectives in enhancing photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance.

         <title>Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Modules Enabled by Inhibited Escape of Volatile Species</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The intrinsically weak bonding structure in halide perovskite materials makes components in the thin films volatile, leading to decomposition of halide perovskite materials. The reactions within the perovskite film are reversible provided that components do not escape the thin films. Here, we report a holistic approach to improve the efficiency and stability of PSMs by preventing the effusion of volatile components. Specifically, we have developed a method for in&#8208;situ generation of channel barrier layers for perovskite photovoltaic modules. The resulting PSMs attain a certified aperture PCE of 21.37%, and possess remarkable continuous operation stability for maximum power point tracking (MPPT) of T90 &gt; 1100 h in ambient air, and damp heat (DH) tracking of T93 &gt; 1400 h.

The resulting PSMs attain a certified aperture PCE of 21.37%, and possess remarkable continuous operation stability for maximum power point tracking (MPPT) of T&lt;sub&gt;90&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;gt; 1100 h in ambient air, and damp heat (DH) tracking of T&lt;sub&gt;93&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;gt; 1400 h.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Tailored Succinic Acid&#8208;Derived Molecular Structures Toward 25.41%&#8208;Efficiency and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

Abstract
Minimizing interfacial charged traps in perovskite films is crucial for reducing the non&#8208;radiative recombination and improving device performance. In this study, succinic acid (SA) derivatives varying active sites and spatial configurations were designed to modulate defects and crystallization in perovskite film. The SA derivative with two symmetric Br atoms, dibromosuccinic acid (DBSA), exhibited the optimal spatial arrangement for defect passivation. Experimental and theoretical results indicate that the carboxyl group and atomic Br in DBSA synergistically interact with the under&#8208;coordinated Pb2+. Moreover, the strong electronegativity of Br efficiently stabilizes the formamidinium cation via electrostatic interaction. Consequently, film quality was significantly improved and non&#8208;radiative recombination was markedly depressed, resulting in a photoluminesence lifetime of exceeding 4 &#956;s of and a carrier diffusion length of 3&#160;&#956;m. An exceptional efficiency of 25.41% (certified at 25.00%) along with a high fill factor of 84.39% and excellent long&#8208;term operational stability have been achieved finally.

         <title>In Situ Surface Reconstruction Towards Planar Heterojunction for Efficient and Stable FAPbI3 Quantum Dot Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Pure&#8208;phase &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 quantum dots (QDs) have been the focus of an increasing interest in photovoltaics due to their superior ambient stability, large absorption coefficient and long charge&#8208;carrier lifetime. However, the trap states induced by the ligand&#8208;exchange process limit the photovoltaic performances. Here, we develop a simple post treatment using methylamine thiocyanate (MASCN) to reconstruct the FAPbI3&#8208;QD film surface, in which a MAPbI3 capping layer with a thickness of 6.2 nm is formed on the film top. This planar perovskite heterojunction leads to a reduced density of trap&#8208;states, a decreased band gap, and a facilitated charge carrier transport. As a result, a record high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.23% with negligible hysteresis is achieved for the FAPbI3 QD solar cell, and it retains over 90% of the initial PCE after being stored in ambient environment for 1000 h.

Abstract
Developing a robust strategy for profiling heterogeneous circular tumor cells specifically, distinguishing the phenotypes of which in blood sample of cancer patient precisely, and releasing them sequentially, is significant for cancer management by liquid biopsy. Herein, we report a bio&#8208;inspired free&#8208;standing and flexible film composed of TiO2 nanotube and silk fibroin, fabricated with multiply dynamic bioactive surface (TSF/MDBS) by a simple and eco&#8208;friendly way including using Polydopamine chemistry and dual dynamic covalent chemistry. The as&#8208;prepared TSF/MDBS binds specific peptides towards cells with epithelial biomarker and human epithelial growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) biomarker, and antifouling agents bovine serum albumin for obviating platelets and proteins adhering of blood, can capture heterogeneous CTCs with enhanced capability due to the cytocompatible soft film and exquisite surface design, and further release the captured cells as program, by specifically breaking down the covalent bonds in sequence via the action of adding biocompatible molecules fructose and glutathione. By applying the TSF/MDBS, we can tailor it into desired pieces for identifying CTCs with different phenotypes (HER2&#8208;high and HER2&#8208;low) from the unprocessed blood samples of breast cancer patients, and finally profiling these heterogeneous CTCs, to discriminate HER2 positive or negative of breast cancer patients in clinical applications.

         <title>High Thermoelectric Power Factors in Plastic/Ductile Bulk SnSe2&#8208;based Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The recently&#8208;discovered plastic/ductile inorganic thermoelectric (TE) materials open a new avenue for the fabrication of high&#8208;efficiently flexible TE devices, which can utilize the small temperature difference between human body and environment to generate electricity. However, the maximum power factor (PF) of current plastic/ductile TE materials is usually around or less than 10 &#956;W cm&#8722;1 K&#8722;2, much lower than the classic brittle TE materials. In this work, a record&#8208;high PF of 18.0 &#956;W cm&#8722;1 K&#8722;2 at 375 K in plastic/ductile bulk SnSe2&#8208;based crystals with 4H structure is reported, superior to all the plastic inorganic TE materials and flexible organic TE materials reported before. The origin of such high PF is from the modulation of material's stacking forms and polymorph crystal structures via simultaneously doping Cl/Br at Se&#8208;site and intercalating Cu inside the vdW gap, leading to the significantly enhanced carrier concentrations and carrier mobilities. An in&#8208;plane fully flexible TE device made of the plastic/ductile SnSe2&#8208;based crystals is successfully developed to show a record&#8208;high normalized maximum power density to 0.18&#160;W m&#8722;1 under a temperature difference of 30 K. This work indicates that the plastic/ductile material can realize high TE power factor to achieve large output electric power density in flexible TE technology.

         <title>High Thermoelectric Performance in Phonon&#8208;Glass Electron&#8208;Crystal Like AgSbTe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Achieving glass&#8208;like ultra&#8208;low thermal conductivity in crystalline solids with high electrical conductivity, a crucial requirement for high&#8208;performance thermoelectric energy conversion, continues to be a formidable challenge. A careful balance between electrical and thermal transport is essential for optimizing the thermoelectric performance of a material. Despite this inherent trade&#8208;off, the experimental realization of an ideal thermoelectric material with a &#8220;phonon&#8208;glass electron&#8208;crystal&#8221; (PGEC) nature has rarely been achieved. Here, we have demonstrated PGEC&#8208;like AgSbTe2 by tuning the atomic disorder upon Yb doping, which resulted in an outstanding thermoelectric performance with figure of merit, zT&#8764;2.4 at 573 K. Yb&#8208;doping induced enhanced atomic ordering decreases the overlap between the hole and phonon mean free paths and consequently leads to a PGEC&#8208;like transport behaviour in AgSbTe2. We observed a two&#8208;fold increase in electrical mobility while keeping the position of the Fermi level (EF) nearly unchanged, which significantly increased the electrical conductivity and corroborates the enhanced crystalline nature of the AgSbTe2 lattice upon Yb doping for electrical transport. The cation&#8208;ordered domains, on the other hand, lead to the formation of nanoscale superstructures (&#8764; 2 to 4&#160;nm) that strongly scatter heat carrying phonons, resulting in a temperature&#8208;independent glass&#8208;like thermal conductivity. Furthermore, we have achieved a promising output power density of 388 mWcm&#8722;2 in a 4&#8208;leg device fabricated using 4 mol% Yb&#8208;doped AgSbTe2 as the p&#8208;type analogue. Our strategy paves the way for realizing high thermoelectric performance in various disordered crystals by making them amorphous to phonons while favoring crystal&#8208;like electrical transport.

         <title>Self&#8208;Rectifying Memristors for Three&#8208;Dimensional&#160;In&#8208;Memory Computing</title>

         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the research progress in self&#8208;rectifying memristors (SRM) and SRM&#8208;based applications including 3D memory, in&#8208;memory computing, neuromorphic computing, and hardware security. Through a comprehensive analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of SRMs in different application scenarios, as well as challenges at the device, 3D integration, and peripheral circuit levels, corresponding research ideas and potential solutions are proposed.








Abstract
Costly data movement in terms of time and energy in traditional von Neumann systems is exacerbated by emerging information technologies related to artificial intelligence. In&#8208;memory computing (IMC) architecture aims to address this problem. Although the IMC hardware prototype represented by a memristor is developed rapidly and performs well, the sneak path issue is a critical and unavoidable challenge prevalent in large&#8208;scale and high&#8208;density crossbar arrays, particularly in three&#8208;dimensional (3D) integration. As a perfect solution to the sneak&#8208;path issue, a self&#8208;rectifying memristor (SRM) is proposed for 3D integration because of its superior integration density. To date, SRMs have performed well in terms of power consumption (aJ level) and scalability (&gt;102&#160;Mbit). Moreover, SRM&#8208;configured 3D integration is considered an ideal hardware platform for 3D IMC. This review focuses on the progress in SRMs and their applications in 3D memory, IMC, neuromorphic computing, and hardware security. The advantages, disadvantages, and optimization strategies of SRMs in diverse application scenarios are illustrated. Challenges posed by physical mechanisms, fabrication processes, and peripheral circuits, as well as potential solutions at the device and system levels, are also discussed.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Nanolayer&#8208;Derived Zincophilicity Suppressing Metallic Zinc Dendrites and Its Efficacy in Improving Electrochemical Stability of Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
From the initial Zn deposition, a Zn&#8208;Au alloy grows from the Au&#8208;coating layer. This further results in smooth Zn deposition, which stabilizes long&#8208;term Zn stripping/plating without Zn dendrite via the &#8216;embracing effect&#8217;.








Abstract
Herein, an Au&#8208;coating layer adjusted on the surface of a Zn metal electrode that effectively suppresses the dendrite growth as well as the mechanisms underlying the dendrite suppression as a result of the zincophilic character of Au is introduced. For the Au&#8208;coated Zn metal symmetric cell, uniform deposition of Zn&#8208;derived compounds&#160;was revealed by operando synchrotron tomography. Microscopic studies demonstrate that the Au&#8208;coating layer is induced to form a new Zn&#8211;Au alloy during the initial Zn deposition, resulting in stabilized long&#8208;term stripping/plating of Zn via the &#8216;embracing effect&#8217; that intimately accommodates Zn deposition for further cycles. This property supports the successful operation of symmetrical cells up to 50 mA cm&#8722;2. According to Zn electrodeposition simulation, it is verified that the suppression of dendrite growth is responsible for the electro&#8208;conducting Au nanolayer that uniformly distributes the electric field and protects the Zn electrode from corrosion, ultimately promoting uniform Zn growth. The compatibility of the Au&#8208;coating layer for full cell configuration is verified using NaV3O8 as a cathode material over 1&#160;000 cycles. This finding provides a new pathway for the enhancement of the electrochemical performance of ZIBs by suppressing the dendritic growth of Zn by means of a zincophilic Au nanolayer.

         <title>A Gate&#8208;Tunable Ambipolar Quantum Phase Transition in a Topological Excitonic Insulator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Coulomb interactions among electrons and holes in two&#8208;dimensional (2D) semimetals with overlapping valence and conduction bands can give rise to a correlated insulating ground state via exciton formation and condensation. One candidate material in which such excitonic state uniquely combines with non&#8208;trivial band topology are atomic monolayers of tungsten ditelluride (WTe2), in which a 2D topological excitonic insulator (2D TEI) forms. However, the detailed mechanism of the 2D bulk gap formation in WTe2, in particular with regard to the role of Coulomb interactions, has remained a subject of ongoing debate. Here, we&#160;show that WTe2 is susceptible to a gate&#8208;tunable quantum phase transition, evident from an abrupt collapse of its 2D bulk energy gap upon ambipolar field&#8208;effect doping. Such gate tunability of a 2D TEI, into either n&#8208; and p&#8208;type semimetals, promises novel handles of control over non&#8208;trivial 2D superconductivity with excitonic&#160;pairing.

         <title>Nonreciprocal Heat Circulation Meta&#8208;Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Thermal nonreciprocity typically stems from nonlinearity or spatiotemporal variation of parameters. However, constrained by the inherent temperature&#8208;dependent properties and the law of mass conservation, previous works were compelled to treat dynamic and steady&#8208;state cases separately. Here, by establishing a unified thermal scattering theory, we report the creation of a convection&#8208;based thermal meta&#8208;device which supports both dynamic and steady&#8208;state nonreciprocal heat circulation. We observe the non&#8208;trivial dependence between the nonreciprocal resonance peaks and the dynamic parameters, and reveal the unique nonreciprocal mechanism of multiple scattering at steady state. This mechanism enables thermal nonreciprocity in the initially quasi&#8208;symmetric scattering matrix of our three&#8208;port meta&#8208;device, and has been experimentally validated with a significant isolation ratio of heat fluxes. Our findings establish a framework for thermal nonreciprocity that can be smoothly modulated for dynamic and steady&#8208;state heat signals, it may also offer insight into other heat&#8208;transfer&#8208;related problems or even other fields such as acoustics and mechanics.

         <title>Super&#8208;structured Wet&#8208;Adhesive Hydrogel with Ultralow Swelling, Ultrahigh Burst Pressure Tolerance, And Anti&#8208;Postoperative Adhesion Properties for Tissue Adhesion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Wet&#8208;adhesive hydrogels have been developed as an attractive strategy for tissue repair. However, achieving simultaneously low swelling and high burst pressure tolerance of wet&#8208;adhesive hydrogels is crucial for in vivo application which remains challenges. Herein, a novel super&#8208;structured porous hydrogel (denoted as PVA/PAAc&#8208;N+) is designed via facile moisture&#8208;induced phase separation&#8208;solvent exchange process for obtaining porous PVA hydrogel as dissipative layer and in&#8208;situ photocuring technology for entangling PAAc&#8208;N+ wet&#8208;adhesive layer with the porous surface of PVA layer. Benefitting from the ionic crosslinking between quaternary ammonium ions and carboxylate ions in PAAc&#8208;N+ wet&#8208;adhesive layer as well as the high crystallinity induced by abundant hydrogen bonds of PVA layer, our hydrogel has unique ultralow swelling property (0.29) without sacrificing adhesion strength (63.1&#160;kPa). The porous structure of tough PVA facilitates the mechanical interlock at the interface between PAAc&#8208;N+ wet&#8208;adhesive layer and tough PVA dissipative layer, leading to the ultrahigh burst pressure tolerance up to 493&#160;mm Hg and effective repair for porcine heart rupture; the PVA layer surface of PVA/PAAc&#8208;N+ hydrogel can prevent postoperative adhesion. By integrating ultralow swelling, ultrahigh burst pressure tolerance, and anti&#8208;postoperative adhesion properties simultaneously, our PVA/PAAc&#8208;N+ hydrogel shows an appealing application prospect for tissue repair.

The abnormal amyloid&#8208;&#946; accumulation is essential and obbligato in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis and natural polyphenols exhibited great potential as amyloid aggregation inhibitors. However, the poor metabolic stability, low bioavailability, and weak blood&#8208;brain barrier crossing ability of natural polyphenol molecules fail to meet clinical needs. Here, we develop a universal protocol to prepare natural polyphenolic nanodots by heating in aqueous solution without unacceptable additives. The nanodots are able to not only inhibit amyloid&#8208;&#946; fibrillization and trigger the fibrils disaggregation, but mitigate the amyloid&#8208;&#946; plaques induced cascade impairments including normalizing oxidative microenvironment, altering microglial polarization, and rescuing neuronal death and synaptic loss, which resulting in significant improvements in recognition and cognition deficits in transgenic mice. More importantly, natural polyphenolic nanodots possess stronger anti&#8208;amyloidogenic performance compared with small molecule, as well as penetrate the blood&#8208;brain barrier. The excellent biocompatibility further guarantees the potential of natural polyphenolic nanodots for clinical applications. It is expected that natural polyphenolic nanodots provides an attractive paradigm to support the development of the therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease.

         <title>Self&#8208;Powered Wide&#8208;Narrow Bandgap Laminated Perovskite Photodetector with Bipolar Photoresponse for Secure Optical Communication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Perovskite photodetectors with bipolar photoresponse characteristics are expected to be applied in the field of secure optical communication (SOC). However, how to realize the perovskite photodetector with bipolar response remains challenging. Herein, by introducing bismuth iodide (BiI3) into Sn&#8208;Pb mixed perovskite precursor solution, two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskite FA3Bi2I9 is spontaneously formed at the bottom to realize a wide&#8208;narrow bandgap laminated perovskite film. Wavelength dependent bipolar response is realized based on the absorption difference of the photoactive region with different bandgap combined with the carrier competition of the homotypic transport layer adopted in the as&#8208;fabricated photodetector. Under the visible/near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light irradiation, the bottom/top of the film generates a higher carrier concentration, where electrons are easier to be separated and transported by the SnO2/PC61BM to the bottom/top electrodes, respectively, resulting in a negative and positive bipolar response. Finally, based on positive NIR signal as the effective signal and negative visible signal as the interference signal, the SOC system is realized, where the positive NIR signal is well hidden by the negative visible signal. This work provides a simple and feasible strategy for fabrication of laminated perovskite films to achieve bipolar response.

         <title>Palygorskite&#8208;Derived Ternary Fluoride with 2d Ion Transport Channels for Ampere Hour&#8208;scale Li&#8208;S Pouch Cell with High Energy Density</title>

Abstract
Although various excellent electrocatalysts/adsorbents have made notable progress as sulfur cathode hosts on the lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) coin&#8208;cell level, high energy density (WG) of the practical Li&#8208;S pouch cells is still limited by inefficient Li&#8208;ion transport in the thick sulfur cathode under low electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) and negative/positive (N/P) ratios, which aggravates the shuttle effect and sluggish redox kinetics. Here we develop a new ternary fluoride MgAlF5&#183;2H2O with ultrafast ion conduction&#8211;strong polysulfides capture integration. MgAlF5&#183;2H2O has an inverse Weberite&#8208;type crystal framwork, in which the corner&#8208;sharing [AlF6]&#8211;[MgF4 (H2O)2] octahedra units extend to form two&#8208;dimensional Li&#8208;ion transport channels along the [100] and [010] directions, respectively. Applied as the cathode sulfur host, the MgAlF5&#183;2H2O lithiated by LiTFSI (lithium salt in Li&#8208;S electrolyte) acts as a fast ionic conductor to ensure efficient Li&#8208;ion transport to accelerate the redox kinetics under high S loadings and low E/S and N/P. Meanwhile, the strong polar MgAlF5&#183;2H2O captures polysulfides by chemisorption to suppress the shuttle effect. Therefore, a 1.97 A h&#8211;level Li&#8208;S pouch cell achieves a high WG of 386 Wh kg&#8722;1. This work develops a new&#8208;type ionic conductor, and provides unique insights and new hosts for designing practical Li&#8208;S pouch cells.

         <title>A Multifunctional Amino Acid Enables The Direct Recycling of Spent LiFePO4 Cathode Material</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4, LFP) batteries have been extensively used in electric vehicles and energy storage due to their good cycling stability and safety. However, the finite service life of lithium&#8208;ion batteries has led to significant amounts of retired LFP batteries, urgently required to be recycled by environmentally friendly and effective methods. Here, we propose a direct regeneration strategy using natural and low&#8208;cost L&#8208;threonine as a multifunctional reductant. The hydroxyl groups and amino groups in L&#8208;threonine act as electron donors and nitrogen sources, respectively. The reductive environment created by L&#8208;threonine not only aids in converting the degraded FePO4 phase back to a single LFP phase, but also facilitates the elimination of detrimental Li&#8208;Fe anti&#8208;site defects, thus reconstructing fast Li+ diffusion channels. Meanwhile, N atoms derived from amino groups are able to dope into carbon layers, generating more active sites and enhancing the conductive properties of LFP particles. The regenerated LFP shows great electrochemical performance with a discharge capacity of 147.9 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 C rate and a capacity retention of 86% after 500 cycles at 5 C rate. Furthermore, this approach is also feasible for LFP black mass sourced from practical industrial dismantling lines, providing considerable prospects for the large&#8208;scale practical application of LFP recycling.

         <title>Experimental Realization of Monolayer &#913;&#8208;Tellurene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials have emerged as a versatile platform for developing next&#8208;generation devices. The experimental realization of novel artificial 2D atomic crystals, which do not have bulk counterparts in nature, is still challenging and always requires new physical or chemical processes. Monolayer &#945;&#8208;tellurene was predicted to be a stable 2D allotrope of tellurium (Te), which has great potential for applications in high&#8208;performance field&#8208;effect transistors. However, the synthesis of monolayer &#945;&#8208;tellurene remains elusive because of its complex lattice configuration, in which the Te atoms are stacked in tri&#8208;layers in an octahedral fashion. Here, a self&#8208;assemble approach, using three atom&#8208;long Te chains derived from the dynamic non&#8208;equilibrium growth of an a&#8208;Si:Te alloy as building blocks, is reported for the epitaxial growth of monolayer &#945;&#8208;tellurene on a Sb2Te3 substrate. By combining scanning tunnelling microscopy/spectroscopy with density functional theory calculations, the surface morphology and electronic structure of monolayer &#945;&#8208;tellurene are revealed and the underlying growth mechanism is determined. The successful synthesis of monolayer &#945;&#8208;tellurene opens up the possibility for the application of this new single&#8208;element 2D material in advanced electronic devices.

         <title>Self&#8208;Powered Temperature Electronic Skin Based on Island&#8208;Bridge Structure and Bi&#8208;Te Micro&#8208;Thermoelectric Generator for Distributed Mini&#8208;Region Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;powered temperature sensing electronic skin (STES) is designed based on island&#8208;bridge structure. Flexible interconnection of rigid sensing units (BiTe&#8208;based micro&#8208;thermoelectric generators (&#181;&#8208;TEGs)) can be realized by the combination of processing serpentine wires and forming chemical bonds between polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and quartz glass substrates. Due to the reliable structure and excellent performance, the STES shows great potential in mini&#8208;region temperature sensing field.








Abstract
Thermoelectric (TE) effect based temperature sensor can accurately convert temperature signal into voltage without external power supply, which have great application prospects in self&#8208;powered temperature electronic skin (STES). But the fabrication of stretchable and distributed STES still remains a challenge. Here, a novel STES design strategy is proposed by combining flexible island&#8208;bridge structure with BiTe&#8208;based micro&#8208;thermoelectric generator (&#181;&#8208;TEG). Furthermore, a 4&#160;&#215;&#160;4 vertical temperature sensor array with good stretchability and distributed sensing property has been fabricated for the first time. The interfacial chemical bonds located between the rigid islands (&#181;&#8208;TEG) and the flexible substrate (polydimethylsiloxane, PDMS) endow the STES with excellent stretchability, and its sensing performance remains unchanged under 30% strain (the maximum strain of human skin).

&lt;p&gt;A self-powered temperature sensing electronic skin (STES) is designed based on island-bridge structure. Flexible interconnection of rigid sensing units (BiTe-based micro-thermoelectric generators (&#181;-TEGs)) can be realized by the combination of processing serpentine wires and forming chemical bonds between polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and quartz glass substrates. Due to the reliable structure and excellent performance, the STES shows great potential in mini-region temperature sensing field.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thermoelectric (TE) effect based temperature sensor can accurately convert temperature signal into voltage without external power supply, which have great application prospects in self-powered temperature electronic skin (STES). But the fabrication of stretchable and distributed STES still remains a challenge. Here, a novel STES design strategy is proposed by combining flexible island-bridge structure with BiTe-based micro-thermoelectric generator (&#181;-TEG). Furthermore, a 4&#160;&#215;&#160;4 vertical temperature sensor array with good stretchability and distributed sensing property has been fabricated for the first time. The interfacial chemical bonds located between the rigid islands (&#181;-TEG) and the flexible substrate (polydimethylsiloxane, PDMS) endow the STES with excellent stretchability, and its sensing performance remains unchanged under 30% strain (the maximum strain of human skin). Moreover, the STES sensing unit possesses high sensitivity (729 &#181;V K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), rapid response time (0.157 s), and high spatial resolution (2.75&#160;&#215;&#160;2.75 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). As a proof of concept, this work demonstrates the application of the STES in the detection of mini-region heat sources in various scenarios including noncontact spatial temperature responsing, intelligent robotic thermosensing, and wearable temperature sensing. Such an inspiring design strategy is expected to provide guidance for the design and fabrication of wearable self-powered temperature sensors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Epitaxial Growth of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 at a Well&#8208;Matched Heterointerface for Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells and Solar Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Although the FAPbI3 perovskite system exhibits an impressive optoelectronic characteristic and thermal stability because of its energetically unstable black phase at room temperature, it is considerably challenging to attain a controllable and oriented nucleation of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3. To overcome this challenge, a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskite with a released inorganic octahedral distortion designed by weakening the hydrogen interactions between the organic interlayer and [PbI6]4&#8208; octahedron is presented in this study. A highly matched heterointerface can be formed between the (002) facet of the 2D structure and the (100) crystal plane of the cubic &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3, thereby lowering the crystallization energy and inducing a heterogeneous nucleation of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3. This &#8220;epitaxial growth&#8221; mechanism results forms the highly preferred crystallographic orientation of the (100) facets, improved crystal quality and film uniformity, substantially increased charge transporting characteristics, and suppressed nonradiative recombination losses. An impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.4% (certified 25.2%) is achieved using target PSCs, which demonstrates outstanding ambient and operational stability. We prove the feasibility of this strategy for the scalable deposition of homogeneous and high&#8208;quality perovskite thin films by demonstrating the remarkably increased PCE of the large&#8208;area perovskite solar module, from 18.2% to 20.1%.

         <title>Manipulating Coherent Exciton Dynamics in CsPbI3 Perovskite Quantum Dots Using Magnetic Field</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Lead halide perovskite quantum dots (QDs) have recently emerged as a promising material platform for quantum information processing owing to their strong light&#8208;matter interaction and relatively long&#8208;lived optical and spin coherences. In particular, the coherence of the fine&#8208;structure bright excitons is sustainable up to room temperature and can be observed even at an ensemble level. Here we demonstrate modulation of the polarization of these excitons in CsPbI3 QDs and manipulation of their time&#8208;domain coherent dynamics using a longitudinal magnetic field. The manipulation is realized using femtosecond quantum beat spectroscopy performed with both circularly&#8208; and linear&#8208;polarized pulses. The results are well captured by our density of matrix simulation and are picturized using a Bloch sphere. This study forms the basis for preparing arbitrary coherent superpositions of excitons in perovskite QDs for an array of quantum technologies under near&#8208;ambient conditions.

         <title>Modulating Charge Separation of Oxygen&#8208;Doped Boron Nitride with Isolated Co Atoms for Enhancing CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isolated Co atoms are successfully anchored on oxygen&#8208;doped boron nitride (Co/BNF) to enhance photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance. The uniformly dispersed Co atoms with a CoO2N1 coordination geometry play an essential role in promoting the separation of photogenerated charge carriers and lowering the reaction energy barriers, thus boosting the activity and selectivity of Co/BNF for photocatalytic CO2 reduction.








Abstract
To alleviate the greenhouse effect and address the related energy crisis, solar&#8208;driven reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) to value&#8208;added products is considered as a sustainable strategy. However, the insufficient separation and rapid recombination of photogenerated charge carriers during photocatalysis greatly limit their reduction efficiency and practical application potential. Here, isolated Cobalt (Co) atoms are successfully decorated into oxygen&#8208;doped boron nitride (BN)&#160;via an in situ pyrolysis method, achieving greatly improved catalytic activity and selectivity to the carbon monoxide (CO) product. X&#8208;ray absorption fine spectroscopy demonstrates that the isolated Co atoms are stabilized by the O and N atoms with an unsaturated CoO2N1 configuration. Further experimental investigation and theoretical simulations confirm that the decorated Co atoms not only work as the real active center during the CO2 reduction process, but also perform as the electron pump to promote the electron/hole separation and transfer, resulting in greatly accelerated reaction kinetics and improved activity. In addition, the CoO2N1 coordination geometry is favorable to the conversion from *CO2 to *COOH, which shall be considered as a selectivity&#8208;determining step for the evolution of the CO products. The surface modulation strategy at the atomic level opens a new avenue for regulating the reaction kinetics for photocatalytic CO2 reduction.

         <title>MOFs for Ultrahigh Efficiency Pulsed Laser Micropropulsion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), which are composed of metal cations and organic ligands forming ordered structures through coordination, with their unique composition eliminating the problem of local hot zones and uneven mixing encountered in laser micropropulsion (LMP), allowing for enhanced propulsion efficiency.








Abstract
Conventional propellant materials, such as polymers and single metal elements, have long been investigated for their potential in pulsed laser micropropulsion (LMP) technology. However, achieving superior LMP efficiency through physical mixing of these materials remains a significant challenge. This study presents a paradigm shift by introducing porous crystalline polymers, known as metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), as novel propellants in pulsed LMP. MOFs are composed of metal cations and organic ligands that form ordered structures through coordination, eliminating the problem of local hot zones arising from uneven physical mixing encountered in LMP. In direct comparison to conventional polymers and single element targets, MOFs exhibit substantially higher LMP efficiency. By precisely tailoring the metal atom fraction within MOFs, an extraordinary ultrahigh efficiency of 51.15% is achieved in pulsed LMP, surpassing the performance of similar materials previously reported in the literature. This pioneering application of MOFs not only revolutionizes the field of LMP but also opens up new frontiers for MOF utilization in various energy applications.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Slow evaporation from a pure water solution provides high charging rate pseudocapacitive conjugated polyelectrolyte films that are stable in aqueous electrolytes. Key to stability is increased crystallinity and a high electrolyte concentration for decreasing interchain electrostatic repulsion. This strategy may be applied for integrating organic mixed ionic electronic conductors in applications such as batteries, organic electrochemical transistors, or electrochemical sensors.








Abstract
A subclass of organic semiconductors known as conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) is characterized by a conjugated backbone with ionic pendant groups. The water solubility of CPEs typically hinders applications of thin films in aqueous media. Herein, it is reported that films of an anionic CPE, namely CPE&#8208;K, drop cast from water produces single&#8208;component solid&#8208;state pseudocapacitive electrodes that are insoluble in aqueous electrolyte. That X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments reveal a more structurally ordered film, relative to the as&#8208;obtained powder from chemical synthesis, and dynamic light scattering measurements show an increase in aggregate particle size with increasing [KCl] indicate that CPE&#8208;K films are insoluble because of tight interchain contacts and electrostatic screening by the electrolyte. CPE&#8208;K film electrodes can maintain 85% of their original capacitance (84 F g&#8722;1) at 500 A g&#8722;1 and exhibit excellent cycling stability, where a capacitance retention of 93% after 100&#160;000 cycles at a current density of 35 A g&#8722;1. These findings demonstrate that it is possible to use initially water soluble ionic&#8208;organic materials in aqueous electrolytes, by increasing the electrolyte concentration. This strategy can be applied to the application of conjugated polyelectrolytes in batteries, organic electrochemical transistors, and electrochemical sensors, where fast electron and ion transport are required.

         <title>3D Motion Manipulation for Micro&#8208; and Nanomachines: Progress and Future Directions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review delves into the latest progress made in micro&#8208; and nanomachines (MNMs) with three&#8208;dimensional (3D) motion capabilities by different manipulation approaches, discusses the underlying motion mechanisms and their corresponding applications, explores potential design concepts inspired by nature for guiding the future design direction in controllable 3D motile MNMs, and presents the available 3D observation and tracking systems.








Abstract
In the past decade, micro&#8208; and nanomachines (MNMs) have made outstanding achievements in the fields of targeted drug delivery, tumor therapy, microsurgery, biological detection, and environmental monitoring and remediation. Researchers have made significant efforts to accelerate the rapid development of MNMs capable of moving through fluids by means of different energy sources (chemical reactions, ultrasound, light, electricity, magnetism, heat, or their combinations). However, the motion of MNMs is primarily investigated in confined two&#8208;dimensional (2D) horizontal setups. Furthermore, three&#8208;dimensional (3D) motion control remains challenging, especially for vertical movement and control, significantly limiting its potential applications in cargo transportation, environmental remediation, and biotherapy. Hence, an urgent need is to develop MNMs that can overcome self&#8208;gravity and controllably move in 3D spaces. This review delves into the latest progress made in MNMs with 3D motion capabilities under different manipulation approaches, discusses the underlying motion mechanisms, explores potential design concepts inspired by nature for controllable 3D motion in MNMs, and presents the available 3D observation and tracking systems.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic manufacturing is a guideline for researchers to precisely synthesize materials, customize their properties, and apply them into advanced applications in demand. Atomic manufacturing has the ability to visualize substances at the atomic level, while manipulating them atom by atom, inducing and promoting chemical reactions, and ultimately obtaining products with specific atomic structures.








Abstract
The quest for cutting&#8208;edge materials and devices has necessitated elevated demands for manufacturing methodologies. Atomic manufacturing involves the meticulous design and fabrication of materials and devices at the atomic level, a process that has been facilitated by advancements in comprehending and manipulating atomic behavior. The attainment of atomic manufacturing is dependent on the capacity to precisely manipulate atoms, directing their reactions at will. In this review, five methodologies of atomic fabrication encompassing atomic manipulation, atomic programming, atomic epitaxy, atomic confinement, and atomic assembly are elucidated. Based on this, the utilization of atomic manufacturing in the most advanced domains including energy conversion, energy storage, quantum information technology, and optoelectronic devices is elucidated. Finally, the current challenges and outlook on the forthcoming advancement of atomic manufacturing are presented.

         <title>Thermochromic Printable and Multicolor Polymeric Composite Based on Hybrid Organic&#8211;Inorganic Perovskite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative thermochromic composite consisting of a 2D perovskite and a nonionic block copolymer is developed. It exhibits excellent performance, allowing 80% transmittance modulation in the visible range, taking only a few seconds to switch from the bleached to the colored state (and vice versa) and providing a wide range of colors when heated at 70&#8211;120&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites (PVKs) are among the most promising materials for optoelectronic applications thanks to their outstanding photophysical properties and easy synthesis. Herein, a new PVK&#8208;based thermochromic composite is demonstrated. It can reversibly switch from a transparent state (transmittance &gt; 80%) at room temperature to a colored state (transmittance &lt; 10%) at high temperature, with very fast kinetics, taking only a few seconds to go from the bleached to the colored state (and vice versa). X&#8208;ray diffraction, Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calometry, rheological, and optical measurements carried out during heating/cooling cycles reveal that thermochromism in the material is based on a reversible process of PVK disassembly/assembly mediated by intercalating polymeric chains, through the formation and breaking of hydrogen bonds between polymer and perovskite. Therefore, differently from other thermochromic perovskites, that generally work with the adsorption/desorption of volatile molecules, the system is able to perform several heating/cooling cycles regardless of environmental conditions. The color and transition temperature (from 70 to 120&#160;&#176;C) can be tuned depending on the type of perovskite. Moreover, this thermochromic material is printable and can be deposited by cheap techniques, paving the way for a new class of smart coatings with an unprecedented range of colors.

         <title>Modular Aptamer Switches for the Continuous Optical Detection of Small&#8208;Molecule Analytes in Complex Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A duplex&#8208;bubble switch architecture enables precise modulation of kinetics and thermodynamics without prior knowledge of the ligand binding site. Its integration with fiber&#8208;optic probes and applicability in real&#8208;time optical detection by achieving reversible and binding&#8208;induced fluorescence responses to dopamine and cortisol in complex matrices are demonstrated. This approach promises a universal solution for rapid aptamer&#8208;based sensor development in biomedical applications.








Abstract
Aptamers are a promising class of affinity reagents because signal transduction mechanisms can&#160;be built into the reagent, so that they can directly produce a physically measurable output signal upon target binding. However, endowing the signal transduction functionality into an aptamer remains a trial&#8208;and&#8208;error process that can compromise its affinity or specificity and typically requires knowledge of the ligand binding domain or its structure. In this work, a design architecture that can convert an existing aptamer into a &#8220;reversible aptamer switch&#8221; whose kinetic and thermodynamic properties can be tuned without a priori knowledge of the ligand binding domain or its structure is described. Finally, by combining these aptamer switches with evanescent&#8208;field&#8208;based optical detection hardware that minimizes sample autofluorescence, this study demonstrates the first optical biosensor system that can continuously measure multiple biomarkers (dopamine and cortisol) in complex samples (artificial cerebrospinal fluid and undiluted plasma) with second and subsecond&#8208;scale time responses at physiologically relevant concentration ranges.

         <title>Measuring Solvent Exchange in Silica Nanoparticles with Rotor&#8208;Based Fluorophore</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dynamic solvent exchange process within the silica nanoparticles is monitored with millisecond time resolution by embedding rotor&#8208;based fluorophores in the silica matrix. The additional validations is further demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach as a promising strategy for investigating nanoscale transport diffusion in micropores.








Abstract
Measuring the diffusivity of molecules is the first step toward understanding their dependence and controlling diffusion, but the challenge increases with the decrease of molecular size, particularly for non&#8208;fluorescent and non&#8208;reactive molecules such as solvents. Here, the capability to monitor the solvent exchange process within the micropores of silica with millisecond time resolution is demonstrated, by simply embedding a rotor&#8208;based fluorophore (thioflavin T) in colloidal silica nanoparticles.

     alt="Measuring Solvent Exchange in Silica Nanoparticles with Rotor-Based Fluorophore"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dynamic solvent exchange process within the silica nanoparticles is monitored with millisecond time resolution by embedding rotor-based fluorophores in the silica matrix. The additional validations is further demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach as a promising strategy for investigating nanoscale transport diffusion in micropores.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measuring the diffusivity of molecules is the first step toward understanding their dependence and controlling diffusion, but the challenge increases with the decrease of molecular size, particularly for non-fluorescent and non-reactive molecules such as solvents. Here, the capability to monitor the solvent exchange process within the micropores of silica with millisecond time resolution is demonstrated, by simply embedding a rotor-based fluorophore (thioflavin T) in colloidal silica nanoparticles. Basically, the silica provides an extreme case of viscous microenvironment, which is affected by the polarity of the solvents. The fluorescence intensity traces can be well fitted to the Fickian diffusion model, allowing analytical solution of the diffusion process, and revealing the diffusion coefficients. The validation experiments, involving the water-to-ethanol and ethanol-to-water solvent exchange, the comparison of different drying conditions, and the variation in the degree of cross-linking in silica, confirmed the effectiveness and sensitivity of this method for characterizing diffusion in silica micropores. This work focuses on the method development of measuring diffusivity and the high temporal resolution in tracking solvent exchange dynamics over a short distance (within 165&#160;nm) opens enormous possibilities for further studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Light Management of Metal Halide Scintillators for High&#8208;Resolution X&#8208;Ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective considers light propagation in metal halide scintillators as the focus. By correlating the reported spatial resolution with light propagation in various forms, this perspective clarifies and deepens the understanding of untouched yet fundamental issues, namely, material&#8208;form&#8208;associated light propagation in metal halide scintillators, and provides the design rules for their future development.








Abstract
The ever&#8208;growing need to inspect matter with hyperfine structures requires a revolution in current scintillation detectors, and the innovation of scintillators is revived with luminescent metal halides entering the scene. Notably, for any scintillator, two fundamental issues arise: Which kind of material is suitable and in what form should the material exist? The answer to the former question involves the sequence of certain atoms into specific crystal structures that facilitate the conversion of X&#8208;ray into light, whereas the answer to the latter involves assembling these crystallites into particular material forms that can guide light propagation toward its corresponding pixel detector. Despite their equal importance, efforts are overwhelmingly devoted to improving the X&#8208;ray&#8208;to&#8208;light conversion, while the material&#8208;form&#8208;associated light propagation, which determines the optical signal collected for X&#8208;ray imaging, is largely overlooked. This perspective critically correlates the reported spatial resolution with the light&#8208;propagation behavior in each form of metal halides, combing the designing rules for their future development.

         <title>Potassium&#8208;Based Dual&#8208;Ion Batteries Operating at &#8722;60 &#176;C Enabled By Co&#8208;Intercalation Anode Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To get rid of sluggish interfacial kinetics at subzero, HTO anode with co&#8208;intercalation chemistry and PTPAn cathode with anion storage are prepared for potassium&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion batteries (K&#8208;DIBs). By eliminating the desolvation process, HTO.








Abstract
Battery performance at subzero is restricted by sluggish interfacial kinetics. To resolve this issue, potassium&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion batteries (K&#8208;DIBs) based on the polytriphenylamine (PTPAn) cathode with anion storage chemistry and the hydrogen titanate (HTO) anode with K+/solvent co&#8208;intercalation mechanism are constructed. Both the PTPAn cathode and the HTO anode do not undergo the desolvation process, which can effectively accelerate the interfacial kinetics at subzero. As revealed by theoretical calculations and experimental analysis, the strong K+/solvent binding energy in the dilute electrolyte, the charge shielding effect of the crystal water, and the uniform SEI layer with high content of the flexible organic species synergically promote HTO to undergo K+/solvent co&#8208;intercalation behavior. The special co&#8208;intercalation mechanism and anion storage chemistry enable HTO||PTPAn K&#8208;DIBs with superior rate performance and cycle durability, maintaining a capacity retention of 94.1% after 6000 cycles at &#8722;40 &#176;C and 91% after 1000 cycles at &#8722;60 &#176;C. These results provide a step forward for achieving high&#8208;performance energy storage devices at low temperatures.

         <title>A multifunctional scaffold for bone infection treatment by delivery of microRNA therapeutics combined with antimicrobial nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Treating bone infections and ensuring bone repair is one of the greatest global challenges of modern orthopaedics, made complex by antimicrobial resistance (AMR) risks due to long&#8208;term antibiotic treatment and debilitating large bone defects following infected tissue removal. An ideal multi&#8208;faceted solution would eradicate bacterial infection without long&#8208;term antibiotic use while simultaneously stimulating osteogenesis and angiogenesis. Here, we developed a multifunctional collagen&#8208;based scaffold that addresses these needs by leveraging the potential of antibiotic&#8208;free antimicrobial nanoparticles (copper&#8208;doped bioactive glass, CuBG) to combat infection without contributing to AMR in conjunction with microRNA&#8208;based gene therapy (utilising an inhibitor of microRNA&#8208;138) to stimulate both osteogenesis and angiogenesis. CuBG scaffolds reduced the attachment of gram&#8208;positive bacteria by over 80%, showcasing antimicrobial functionality. The antagomiR&#8208;138 nanoparticles induced osteogenesis of human mesenchymal stem cells in vitro, and healed a large load&#8208;bearing defect in a rat femur when delivered on the scaffold. Combining both promising technologies resulted in a multifunctional antagomiR&#8208;138&#8208;activated CuBG scaffold inducing hMSC&#8208;mediated osteogenesis and stimulating vasculogenesis in an in vivo chick chorioallantoic membrane model. Overall, this multifunctional scaffold catalyses killing mechanisms in bacteria while inducing bone repair through osteogenic and angiogenic coupling, making this platform a promising multi&#8208;functional strategy for treating and repairing complex bone infections.

         <title>High Mechanical Strength Alloy&#8208;Like Minerals Prepared by Inorganic Ionic Cocrosslinking</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Alloys often combine different metals to generate superior mechanical properties. However, it is challenging to prepare high mechanical strength minerals with similar strategies. Using calcium carbonate (CaC) and calcium phosphate (CaP) as examples, we synthesized a group of compounds with the chemical formulas Ca(CO3)x(PO4)2(1&#8208;x)/3 (0&lt; x &lt;1, CaCPs) by crosslinking ionic oligomers. Unlike mixtures, these CaCPs exhibited a single temperature for the phase transition from amorphous to crystallized CaC (calcite) and CaP (hydroxyapatite). By heat&#8208;induced synchronous crystallization, dual&#8208;phase CaC/CaP with continuous crystallized boundaries were resembled to alloy&#8208;like minerals (ALMs). The mechanical properties of the ALMs were adjusted by tailoring their chemical compositions to reach a hardness of 5.6&#160;GPa, which exceeded those of control calcite and hydroxyapatite samples by 430% and 260%, respectively. This strategy expands the chemical scope of inorganic materials and holds promise for preparing high&#8208;performance minerals.

         <title>Unlocking The Design Paradigm of In&#8208;Plane Heterojunction with Built&#8208;in Bifunctional Anion Vacancy for Unexpectedly Fast Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Transition metal chalcogenide (TMD) electrodes in sodium&#8208;ion batteries exhibit intrinsic shortcomings such as sluggish reaction kinetics, unstable conversion thermodynamics, and substantial volumetric strain effects, which lead to electrochemical failure. This report unlocks a design paradigm of VSe2&#8208;x/C in&#8208;plane heterojunction with built&#8208;in anion vacancy, achieved through an in&#8208;situ functionalization and self&#8208;limited growth approach. Theoretical and experimental investigations reveal the bifunctional role of the Se vacancy in enhancing the ion diffusion kinetics and the structural thermodynamics of NaxVSe2 active phases. Moreover, this in&#8208;plane heterostructure facilitates complete face contact between the two components and tight interfacial conductive contact between the conversion phases, resulting in enhanced reaction reversibility. The VSe2&#8208;x/C heterojunction electrode exhibits remarkable sodium&#8208;ion storage performance, retaining specific capacities of 448.7 and 424.9 mAh g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles at current densities of 5 and 10 A g&#8722;1, respectively. Moreover, it exhibits a high specific capacity of 353.1 mAh g&#8722;1 even under the demanding condition of 100 A g&#8722;1, surpassing most previous achievements. The proposed strategy can be extended to other V5S8&#8208;x and V2O5&#8208;x&#8208;based heterojunctions, marking a conceptual breakthrough in advanced electrode design for constructing high&#8208;performance sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

Moreover, this in-plane heterostructure facilitates complete face contact between the two components and tight interfacial conductive contact between the conversion phases, resulting in enhanced reaction reversibility. The VSe&lt;sub&gt;2-x&lt;/sub&gt;/C heterojunction electrode exhibits remarkable sodium-ion storage performance, retaining specific capacities of 448.7 and 424.9 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 1000 cycles at current densities of 5 and 10 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. Moreover, it exhibits a high specific capacity of 353.1 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; even under the demanding condition of 100 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, surpassing most previous achievements. The proposed strategy can be extended to other V&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;8-x&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5-x&lt;/sub&gt;-based heterojunctions, marking a conceptual breakthrough in advanced electrode design for constructing high-performance sodium-ion batteries.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Two&#8208;color Amplified Spontaneous Emission from Liquid Suspensions of Engineered Quantum Dots with Suppressed Auger Recombination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Colloidal quantum&#8208;dot (QD) lasing is normally achieved in close&#8208;packed solid&#8208;state films, as a high QD volume fraction is required for stimulated emission to outcompete fast Auger decay of optical&#8208;gain&#8208;active multiexciton states. Here we demonstrate a new type of optical&#8208;gain medium in which QDs are liquefied using a small amount of a solvent. This high&#8208;density QD suspension behaves as a transparent liquid which can be handled as a traditional laser dye. To test the utility of these liquid media as lasing materials, we use recently developed compact compositionally&#8208;graded QDs (ccg&#8208;QDs) that feature strong suppression of Auger decay. Transient absorption measurements of ccg&#8208;QD liquid suspensions reveal broad&#8208;band optical gain spanning a wide spectral range from 560&#160;nm (green) to 675&#160;nm (red). The gain magnitude is sufficient to realize a two&#8208;color amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) at 637&#160;nm and 594&#160;nm due to the band&#8208;edge (1S) and the excited&#8208;state (1P) transition, respectively. Importantly, the ASE regime is achieved using quasi&#8208;continuous excitation with nanosecond pulses. Furthermore, the ASE is highly stable under prolonged excitation. This stands in contrast to traditional dyes that exhibit strong degradation under identical excitation conditions. These observations point towards a considerable potential of high&#8208;density ccg&#8208;QD suspensions as liquid, dye&#8208;like optical gain media that feature readily achievable spectral tunability and stable operation under intense photoexcitation.

         <title>Selenium&#8208;Anchored Chlorine Redox Chemistry in Aqueous Zinc Dual&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Chlorine&#8208;based batteries with Cl0 to Cl&#8722; redox reaction (ClRR) are promising for high&#8208;performance energy storage due to their high redox potential and large theoretical capacity. However, the inherent gas&#8208;liquid conversion feature of ClRR together with poor Cl fixation can cause Cl2 leakage, reducing battery reversibility and raising the safety concern. Herein, we utilize a Se&#8208;based organic molecule, diphenyl diselenide (di&#8208;Ph&#8208;Se), as the Cl anchoring agent and realize an atomic level&#8208;Cl fixation through chalcogen&#8208;halogen coordinating chemistry, achieving a highly reversible ClRR with extra low Cl2 emission and a notably high discharge voltage (1.87&#160;V versus Zn2+/Zn). The promoted Cl fixation, with two oxidized Cl0 anchoring on a single Ph&#8208;Se, and the multivalence conversion of Se contribute to a six&#8208;electron conversion process, resulting in a significantly high discharge capacity of up to 507 mAh g&#8722;1 with an average voltage of 1.51&#160;V and a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.3%, as well as a high energy density of 665&#160;Wh Kg&#8722;1. Based on the superior reversibility of the developed di&#8208;Ph&#8208;Se electrode with ClRR, a remarkable rate performance (205 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 A g&#8722;1) and cycling performance (with a capacity retention of 77.3% after 500 cycles) are achieved. Significantly, the pouch cell delivers a record areal capacity of up to 6.87 mAh cm&#8722;2 and extraordinary self&#8208;discharge performance, demonstrating great potential for practical applications. This chalcogen&#8208;halogen coordination chemistry between the Se electrode and Cl provides a new insight for developing reversible and efficient batteries with halogen redox reactions.

         <title>Strong P&#8208;D Orbital Hybridization on Bismuth Nanosheets for High Performing CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Single&#8208;atom alloys (SAAs) show great potential for a variety of electrocatalytic reactions. However, the atomic orbital hybridization effect of SAAs on the electrochemical reactions is unclear yet. Herein, we show the in situ confinement of vanadium/molybdenum atoms on bismuth nanosheet to create SAAs with rich grain boundaries. With the detailed analysis of microstructure and composition, the strong p&#8208;d orbital hybridization between bismuth and vanadium enables the exceptional electrocatalytic performance for carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction with the Faradaic efficiency nearly 100% for C1 products in a wide potential range from &#8722;0.6 to &#8722;1.4&#160;V, and a long&#8208;term electrolysis stability for 90&#160;h. In&#8208;depth in situ investigations with theoretical computations reveal that the electron delocalization towards vanadium atoms via the p&#8208;d orbital hybridization evokes the bismuth active centers for efficient CO2 activation via the &#963;&#8208;donation of O&#8208;to&#8208;Bi, thus reduces protonation energy barriers for formate production. With such fundamental understanding, SAA electrocatalyst was employed to fabricated the solar&#8208;driven electrolytic cell of CO2 reduction and 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation, achieving an outstanding 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid yield of 90.5%. This study demonstrates a feasible strategy to rationally design advanced SAA electrocatalysts via the basic principles of p&#8208;d orbital hybridization.

         <title>Manipulating Surface Band Bending of III&#8208;Nitride Nanowires with Ambipolar Charge&#8208;Transfer Characteristics: A Pathway Toward Advanced Photoswitching Logic Gates and Encrypted Optical Communication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper reports a novel postepitaxy method: thickness&#8208;tunable carbon layer decoration to continuously manipulate the surface band bending of III&#8208;nitride semiconductors for the first time. Enabled by the accurate modulation of the thickness of carbon layers, a spectrally distinctive bipolar photoresponse with a controllable polarity&#8208;switching&#8208;point over a wide spectrum range can be achieved, further demonstrating reprogrammable photoswitching logic gates and secured image transmission system.








Abstract
The operational principle of semiconductor devices critically relies on the band structures that ultimately govern their charge&#8208;transfer characteristics. Indeed, the precise orchestration of band structure within semiconductor devices, notably at the semiconductor surface and corresponding interface, continues to pose a perennial conundrum. Herein, for the first time, this work reports a novel postepitaxy method: thickness&#8208;tunable carbon layer decoration to continuously manipulate the surface band bending of III&#8208;nitride semiconductors. Specifically, the surface band bending of p&#8208;type aluminum&#8208;gallium&#8208;nitride (p&#8208;AlGaN) nanowires grown on n&#8208;Si can be precisely controlled by depositing different carbon layers as guided by theoretical calculations, which eventually regulate the ambipolar charge&#8208;transfer behavior between the p&#8208;AlGaN/electrolyte and p&#8208;AlGaN/n&#8208;Si interface in an electrolyte environment. Enabled by the accurate modulation of the thickness of carbon layers, a spectrally distinctive bipolar photoresponse with a controllable polarity&#8208;switching&#8208;point over a wide spectrum range can be achieved, further demonstrating reprogrammable photoswitching logic gates &#8220;XOR&#8221;, &#8220;NAND&#8221;, &#8220;OR&#8221;, and &#8220;NOT&#8221; in a single device. Finally, this work constructs a secured image transmission system where the optical signals are encrypted through the &#8220;XOR&#8221; logic operations. The proposed continuous surface band tuning strategy provides an effective avenue for the development of multifunctional integrated&#8208;photonics systems implemented with nanophotonics.

         <title>Atomic Distance Engineering in Metal Catalysts to Regulate Catalytic Performance</title>

Atomic distance has an important influence on the symmetry and electronic structure of active metal atom. It is classified into three types, namely, the bond length between metal and coordination atom, the distance between single&#8208;atom sites and the arrangement spacing of metal atoms, and their corresponding design strategies and improvement on catalytic performance are systematically summarized and discussed.








Abstract
It is very important to understand the structure&#8211;performance relationship of metal catalysts by adjusting the microstructure of catalysts at the atomic scale. The atomic distance has an essential influence on the composition of the environment of active metal atom, which is a key factor for the design of targeted catalysts with desired function. In this review, we&#160;discuss and summarize strategies for changing the atomic distance from three aspects and relate their effects on the reactivity of catalysts. First, the effects of regulating bond length between metal and coordination atom at one single&#8208;atom site on the catalytic performance are introduced. The bond lengths are affected by the strain effect of the support and high&#8208;shell doping and can evolve during the reaction. Next, the influence of the distance between single&#8208;atom sites on the catalytic performance is discussed. Due to the space matching of adsorption and electron transport, the catalytic performance can be adjusted with the shortening of site distance. In addition, the effect of the arrangement spacing of the surface metal active atoms on the catalytic performance of metal nanocatalysts is studied. Finally, a comprehensive summary and outlook of the relationship between atomic distance and catalytic performance is given.

         <title>Assessing Early Atherosclerosis by Detecting and Imaging of Hypochlorous Acid and Phosphorylation Using Fluorescence Nanoprobe</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a nanoprobe (PCN@FL) is developed to realize the simultaneous detection and imaging of phosphorylation and hypochlorous acid (HClO) for assessing early atherosclerosis. The results showed that the levels of HClO and phosphorylation in the early atherosclerotic mice are significantly higher than those of in normal mice. The nanoprobe provides a suitable fluorescent tool for early atherosclerotic disease assessment.








Abstract
The assessment of early atherosclerosis (AS) is of great significance for the early diagnosis and mechanism research. Herein, a novel nanoprobe PCN@FL is developed to realize the simultaneous detection and imaging of phosphorylation and hypochlorous acid (HClO). The selective recognition of HClO is achieved through the specific interaction between DMTC and HClO, while the levels of phosphorylation are detected via the specific interaction between Zr (IV) and phosphates. The nanoprobe can be utilized to monitor the fluctuations in HClO and phosphate in early atherosclerosis. It is observed that the levels of HClO and phosphate in the serum of early AS mice are higher than those of the normal mice. Ultimately, the levels of hypochlorous acid and phosphorylation in the inner wall of aortic vessels are imaged by two&#8208;photon microscope. The results show that the levels of HClO and phosphorylation in the early atherosclerotic mice are significantly higher than those of in normal mice. The nanoprobe provides a suitable fluorescent tool for simultaneous detection and imaging of HClO and phosphorylation, which holds promise for early atherosclerotic disease assessment.

         <title>Biohybrid Microalgae Robots: Design, Fabrication, Materials, and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Powered by flagella beating, functionalized microalgae robots are demonstrated to move through various biological fluids, water matrices and harsh environments, while performing diverse tasks toward critical biomedical and environmental applications. This review introduces the design, preparation, fabrication, unique functions and latest progress and applications of microalgae&#8208;based biohybrid microrobots, leveraging the attractive self&#8208;propulsion capability of natural microalgae and the versatile modalities of functional materials.








Abstract
The integration of microorganisms and engineered artificial components has shown considerable promise for creating biohybrid microrobots. The unique features of microalgae make them attractive candidates as natural actuation materials for the design of biohybrid microrobotic systems. In this review, microalgae&#8208;based biohybrid microrobots are introduced for diverse biomedical and environmental applications. The distinct propulsion and phototaxis behaviors of green microalgae, as well as important properties from other photosynthetic microalga systems (blue&#8208;green algae and diatom) that are crucial to constructing powerful biohybrid microrobots, will be described first. Then the focus is on chemical and physical routes for functionalizing the algae surface with diverse reactive materials toward the fabrication of advanced biohybrid microalgae robots. Finally, representative applications of such algae&#8208;driven microrobots are presented, including drug delivery, imaging, and water decontamination, highlighting the distinct advantages of these active biohybrid robots, along with future prospects and challenges.

         <title>Transferrin Receptor&#8208;Targeted Nonspherical Microbubbles for Blood&#8211;Brain Barrier Sonopermeation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microbubbles (MB) are naturally spherically shaped, due to surface tension. The engineering, in vitro and in vivo testing of rod&#8208;shaped polymeric MB&#160;surface&#8208;modified with&#160;targeting ligands directed to receptors expressed by blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) endothelial cells is described here. The developed antibody&#8208;functionalized anisotropic MB efficiently target the BBB and promote focused ultrasound&#8208;mediated model drug delivery to brain.








Abstract
Microbubbles (MB) are widely used for ultrasound (US) imaging and drug delivery. MB are typically spherically shaped, due to surface tension. When heated above their glass transition temperature, polymer&#8208;based MB can be mechanically stretched to obtain an anisotropic shape, endowing them with unique features for US&#8208;mediated blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) permeation. It is here shown that nonspherical MB can be surface&#8208;modified with BBB&#8208;specific targeting ligands, thereby promoting binding to and sonopermeation of blood vessels in the brain. Actively targeted rod&#8208;shaped MB are generated via 1D stretching of spherical poly(butyl cyanoacrylate) MB and via subsequently functionalizing their shell with antitransferrin receptor (TfR) antibodies. Using US and optical imaging, it is demonstrated that nonspherical anti&#8208;TfR&#8208;MB bind more efficiently to BBB endothelium than spherical anti&#8208;TfR&#8208;MB, both in vitro and in vivo. BBB&#8208;associated anisotropic MB produce stronger cavitation signals and markedly enhance BBB permeation and delivery of a model drug as compared to spherical BBB&#8208;targeted MB. These findings exemplify the potential of antibody&#8208;modified nonspherical MB for targeted and triggered drug delivery to the brain.

         <title>Emerging Xene&#8208;Based Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts: Theory, Synthesis, and Catalytic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The controlled synthesis, precise characterization, and catalytic applications of emerging Xene&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts from theoretical predictions to experimental investigations are the focus of this review. It is envisioned that this timely review can shed light on new designs of high&#8208;performance Xene&#8208;related single&#8208;atom nanoplatforms for next&#8208;generation chemical and energy conversion.








Abstract
In recent years, the emergence of novel 2D monoelemental materials (Xenes), e.g., graphdiyne, borophene, phosphorene, antimonene, bismuthene, and stanene, has exhibited unprecedented potentials for their versatile applications as well as addressing new discoveries in fundamental science. Owing to their unique physicochemical, optical, and electronic properties, emerging Xenes have been regarded as promising candidates in the community of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) as single&#8208;atom active sites or support matrixes for significant improvement in intrinsic activity and selectivity. In order to comprehensively understand the relationships between the structure and property of Xene&#8208;based SACs, this review represents a comprehensive summary from theoretical predictions to experimental investigations. Firstly, theoretical calculations regarding both the anchoring of Xene&#8208;based single&#8208;atom active sites on versatile support matrixes and doping/substituting heteroatoms at Xene&#8208;based support matrixes are briefly summarized. Secondly, controlled synthesis and precise characterization are presented for Xene&#8208;based SACs. Finally, current challenges and future opportunities for the development of Xene&#8208;based SACs are highlighted.

         <title>Spectral Tuning of High&#8208;Harmonic Generation with Resonance&#8208;Gradient Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel resonance&#8208;gradient metasurfaces are designed and fabricated with varying geometrical parameters that translate into resonant frequencies dependence on one of the coordinates of the metasurface. This general concept is applied to observe the resonant enhancement of the third and fifth harmonics generated from the gradient metasurfaces being used in conjunction with a tunable excitation laser to provide a wide spectral coverage of resonantly&#8208;enhanced tunable generation of multiple optical harmonics.








Abstract
High&#8208;index dielectric subwavelength structures and metasurfaces are capable of enhancing light&#8208;matter interaction by orders of magnitude via geometry&#8208;dependent optical resonances. This enhancement, however, comes with a fundamental limitation of a narrow spectral range of operation in the vicinity of one or few resonant frequencies. Here, this limitation is tackled by introducing an innovative and practical approach to achieve spectrally tunable enhancement of light&#8208;matter interaction with resonant metasurfaces. Resonance&#8208;gradient metasurfaces are designed and fabricated with varying geometrical parameters that translate into resonant frequencies dependence on one of the coordinates of the metasurface. The metasurfaces are composed of bone&#8208;like nanoresonators, which are made of germanium and support high&#8208;quality optical resonances in the mid&#8208;IR spectral range.

     alt="Spectral Tuning of High-Harmonic Generation with Resonance-Gradient Metasurfaces"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novel resonance-gradient metasurfaces are designed and fabricated with varying geometrical parameters that translate into resonant frequencies dependence on one of the coordinates of the metasurface. This general concept is applied to observe the resonant enhancement of the third and fifth harmonics generated from the gradient metasurfaces being used in conjunction with a tunable excitation laser to provide a wide spectral coverage of resonantly-enhanced tunable generation of multiple optical harmonics.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-index dielectric subwavelength structures and metasurfaces are capable of enhancing light-matter interaction by orders of magnitude via geometry-dependent optical resonances. This enhancement, however, comes with a fundamental limitation of a narrow spectral range of operation in the vicinity of one or few resonant frequencies. Here, this limitation is tackled by introducing an innovative and practical approach to achieve spectrally tunable enhancement of light-matter interaction with resonant metasurfaces. Resonance-gradient metasurfaces are designed and fabricated with varying geometrical parameters that translate into resonant frequencies dependence on one of the coordinates of the metasurface. The metasurfaces are composed of bone-like nanoresonators, which are made of germanium and support high-quality optical resonances in the mid-IR spectral range. The concept is applied to observe the resonant enhancement of the third and fifth harmonics generated from the gradient metasurfaces being used in conjunction with a tunable excitation laser to provide a wide spectral coverage of resonantly-enhanced tunable generation of multiple optical&#160;harmonics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Full&#8208;Color Generation via Phototunable Mono Ink for Fast and Elaborate Printings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unlike&#160;traditional pigment&#8208;based inks, this work introduces a novel&#160;mono ink. This innovative formulation facilitates the creation of a broad spectrum of colors by meticulously constructing regularly arranged nanostructures using ultraviolet light. With this ink, one can attain rapid and high&#8208;resolution printing of multicolored images. Notably, the speed of printing is consistent, regardless of the printing area, ensuring high&#8208;throughput capabilities.








Abstract
Unlike pigment&#8208;based colors, which are determined by their molecular structure, diverse colors can be expressed by a regular arrangement of nanomaterials. However, existing techniques for constructing such nanostructures have struggled to combine high precision and speed, resulting in a narrow gamut, and prolonged color fabrication time. Here, this work reports a phototunable mono ink that can generate a wide range of colors by controlling regularly arranged nanostructure. Core&#8211;shell growth controlled by polymerization time precisely regulates the distance between arranged particles at a nanometer&#8208;scale, enabling the generation of various colors. Moreover, the wide and thin arrangement induces constrained out&#8208;of&#8208;plane growth, thus facilitating the intricate color generation at the desired location via photopolymerization. Upon terminating polymerization by oxygen gas, the generated colors are readily fixed and kept stable. Utilizing programmed ultraviolet illumination, large&#8208;scale and high&#8208;resolution (&#8776;1 &#181;m) full&#8208;color printings are demonstrated at high speed (100 mm2 s&#8722;1).

         <title>Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Ethylene: From Advanced Catalyst Design to Industrial Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes and discusses the latest and innovative catalyst design strategies of eCO2RR to ethylene, and subsequently outlines the related important state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art technologies that are essential in driving forward eCO2RR to ethylene into practical applications. Finally, a greenhouse model that integrates CO2 capture, conversion, storage, and utilization is proposed to present an ideal perspective direction of eCO2RR to ethylene.








Abstract
The value&#8208;added chemicals, monoxide, methane, ethylene, ethanol, ethane, and so on, can be efficiently generated through the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) when equipped with suitable catalysts. Among them, ethylene is particularly important as a chemical feedstock for petrochemical manufacture. However, despite its high Faradaic efficiency achievable at relatively low current densities, the substantial enhancement of ethylene selectivity and stability at industrial current densities poses a formidable challenge. To facilitate the industrial implementation of eCO2RR for ethylene production, it is imperative to identify key strategies and potential solutions through comprehending the recent advancements, remaining challenges, and future directions. Herein, the latest and innovative catalyst design strategies of eCO2RR to ethylene are summarized and discussed, starting with the properties of catalysts such as morphology, crystalline, oxidation state, defect, composition, and surface engineering. The review subsequently outlines the related important state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art technologies that are essential in driving forward eCO2RR to ethylene into practical applications, such as CO2 capture, product separation, and downstream reactions. Finally, a greenhouse model that integrates CO2 capture, conversion, storage, and utilization is proposed to present an ideal perspective direction of eCO2RR to ethylene.

         <title>Biomimetic Nanomaterials for the Immunomodulation of the Cardiosplenic Axis Postmyocardial Infarction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomimetic hybrid nanotheranostics are generated featuring an engineered senescent erythrocyte&#8208;based coating material. These nanoagents demonstrate innate localization to the spleen, similar to the source material, and when combined with the histone deacetylase inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, elicit an immunomodulatory effect capable of reducing infarct size in the heart after myocardial infarction.








Abstract
The spleen is an important mediator of both adaptive and innate immunity. As such, attempts to modulate the immune response provided by the spleen may be conducive to improved outcomes for numerous diseases throughout the body. Here, biomimicry is used to rationally design nanomaterials capable of splenic retention and immunomodulation for the treatment of disease in a distant organ, the postinfarct heart. Engineered senescent erythrocyte&#8208;derived nanotheranostic (eSENTs) are generated, demonstrating significant uptake by the immune cells of the spleen including T and B cells, as well as monocytes and macrophages. When loaded with suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), the nanoagents exhibit a potent therapeutic effect, reducing infarct size by 14% at 72 h postmyocardial infarction when given as a single intravenous dose 2 h after injury. These results are supportive of the hypothesis that RBC&#8208;derived biomimicry may provide new approaches for the targeted modulation of the pathological processes involved in myocardial infarction, thus further experiments to decisively confirm the mechanisms of action are currently underway. This novel concept may have far&#8208;reaching applicability for the treatment of a number of both acute and chronic conditions where the immune responses are either stimulated or suppressed by the splenic (auto)immune milieu.

         <title>Self&#8208;Powering Sensory Device with Multi&#8208;Spectrum Image Realization for Smart Indoor Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dual&#8208;functional sensory device exhibits efficient molecular packing and excellent free&#8208;charge generation yield by quantifying charge&#8208;carrier dynamics, resulting in a high output power density of over 94 &#181;W cm&#8722;2 for OPVs, under dim indoor illumination (LED 1000 lx). Moreover, it demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed device by developing a single&#8208;pixel image sensor for practical indoor operation in commercial settings.








Abstract
The development of organic&#8208;based optoelectronic technologies for the indoor Internet of Things market, which relies on ambient energy sources, has increased, with organic photovoltaics (OPVs) and photodetectors (OPDs) considered promising candidates for sustainable indoor electronic devices. However, the manufacturing processes of standalone OPVs and OPDs can be complex and costly, resulting in high production costs and limited scalability, thus limiting their use in a wide range of indoor applications. This study uses a multi&#8208;component photoactive structure to develop a self&#8208;powering dual&#8208;functional sensory device with effective energy harvesting and sensing capabilities. The optimized device demonstrates improved free&#8208;charge generation yield by quantifying charge carrier dynamics, with a high output power density of over 81 and 76 &#181;W cm&#8722;2 for rigid and flexible OPVs under indoor conditions (LED 1000&#160;lx (5200 K)). Furthermore, a single&#8208;pixel image sensor is demonstrated as a feasible prototype for practical indoor operating in commercial settings by leveraging the excellent OPD performance with a linear dynamic range of over 130&#160;dB in photovoltaic mode (no external bias). This apparatus with high&#8208;performance OPV&#8208;OPD characteristics provides a roadmap for further exploration of the potential, which can lead to synergistic effects for practical multifunctional applications in the real world by their mutual relevance.

Recent breakthroughs in modular engineering of regulatable sensor technology via a combination of aptamer probe design with nanotechnology have allowed conditional control of ATP sensing with improved spatial precision. By highlighting their design motivation and working principles, this perspective intends to provide new insights into the development of nanobiotechnology for spatially controlled ATP detection.








Abstract
Dynamic changes of intracellular, extracellular, and subcellular adenosine triphosphates (ATPs) have fundamental interdependence with the physio&#8208;pathological states of cells. Spatially selective in situ imaging of such ATP dynamics offers valuable mechanistic insights into the related biological activities. Despite significant advances in the design of aptamer sensors for ATP detection, the dearth of methods that enable precise ATP imaging in specific cellular locations remains a challenge in this field. This review focuses on the modular engineering of regulatable sensing technology via the integration of aptamer probe designs with advanced functional nanomaterials, allowing conditional control of ATP sensing and imaging with high spatial precision from subcellular organelles to living animals. Highlighting the recent advances in the design of photo&#8208;triggered nanosensors for spatiotemporally controlled ATP imaging, endogenously&#8208;triggered ATP sensing in a cell&#8208;selective manner, and spatially&#8208;controlled nanodevices for ATP imaging in specific organelles and extracellular microenvironments. Emphasis will be put on elucidating the principles of how nanotechnology can be applied to regulate the spatial precision of aptamer&#8208;based ATP sensing activities. The authors envision that this perspective provides insights into the engineering of aptamer&#8208;based nanobiotechnology for opening new frontiers in precise molecular sensing and other bio&#8208;applications.

         <title>Scalable Solution&#8208;Processed Hybrid Electron Transport Layers for Efficient All&#8208;Perovskite Tandem Solar Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, an electron transport layer ink is designed using hybrid fullerenes composed of mixed C60, phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester, and indene&#8208;C60 bisadduct. This electron transport layer exhibits high conductivity, good energy&#8208;level alignment, and low interfacial nonradiative recombination. The all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar modules achieve a champion power conversion efficiency of 23.3% (aperture area = 20.25 cm2).








Abstract
All&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells offer the potential to surpass the Shockley&#8211;Queisser (SQ) limit efficiency of single&#8208;junction solar cells while maintaining the advantages of low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;productivity solution processing. However, scalable solution processing of electron transport layer (ETL) in p&#8208;i&#8208;n structured perovskite solar subcells remains challenging due to the rough perovskite film surface and energy level mismatch between ETL and perovskites. Here, scalable solution processing of hybrid fullerenes (HF) with blade&#8208;coating on both wide&#8208;bandgap (&#8776;1.80 eV) and narrow&#8208;bandgap (&#8776;1.25 eV) perovskite films in all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar modules is developed. The HF, comprising a mixture of fullerene (C60), phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester, and indene&#8208;C60 bisadduct, exhibits improved conductivity, superior energy level alignment with both wide&#8208; and narrow&#8208;bandgap perovskites, and reduced interfacial nonradiative recombination when compared to the conventional thermal&#8208;evaporated C60. With scalable solution&#8208;processed HF as the ETLs, the all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar modules achieve a champion power conversion efficiency of 23.3% (aperture area = 20.25 cm2). This study paves the way to all&#8208;solution processing of low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;efficiency all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar modules in the future.

         <title>Tandem Photon Avalanches for Various Nanoscale Emitters with Optical Nonlinearity up to 41st&#8208;Order through Interfacial Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel tandem photon avalanches (TPA) strategy for various emitters with huge optical nonlinearity up to 41st&#8208;order through interfacial energy transfer is presented. The avalanched 800&#8208;nm Tm3+ emission non&#8208;radiatively pumps Er3+ to exhibit bright PA at a low threshold. Efficient avalanching behaviors are also observed for Ho3+, Ce3+, and blue emission of Tm3+ through the TPA mechanism.








Abstract
Photon avalanche has received continuous attention owing to its superior nonlinear dynamics and promising advanced applications. However, its impact is limited due to the intrinsic energy levels as well as the harsh requirements for the composites and sizes of doped materials. Here, with a universal mechanism named tandem photon avalanche (TPA), giant optical nonlinear response up to 41st&#8208;order in erbium ions, one of the most important lanthanide emitters, has been achieved on the nanoscale through interfacial energy transfer process. After capturing energy directly from the avalanched energy state 3H4 of Tm3+ (800&#8208;nm emission), erbium ions also exhibit bright green and red PA emissions with intensities comparable to that of Tm3+ at a low excitation threshold (7.1 kWcm&#8722;2). Using the same strategy, effective PA looping cycles are successfully activated in Ce3+ and Ho3+. Additionally, Yb3+&#8208;mediated networks are constructed to further propagate PA effects to lowly&#8208;doped Tm3+, enabling 475&#8208;nm PA emission. The newly proposed TPA strategy provides a facile route for generating photon avalanche not only from erbium ions but also from various emitters in multilayered core&#8211;shell nanoparticles.

         <title>Photoelectrons Sequentially Regulate Antibacterial Activity and Osseointegration of Titanium Implants</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Au&#8208;RE/TiO2 coating of titanium implant can generate electron under near infrared light (NIR) illumination. In vivo and in vitro explorations prove the photoelectron&#8208;responsive titanium implants can sequentially regulate antibacterial activity and osseointegration through upconversion, providing a new solution for those patients with post&#8208;implantation infection and poor osseointegration.








Abstract
Titanium implants are widely used ; however, implantation occasionally fails due to infections during the surgery or poor osseointegration after the surgery. To solve the problem, an intelligent functional surface on titanium implant that can sequentially eradicate bacteria biofilm at the initial period and promote osseointegration at the late period of post&#8208;surgery time is designed. Such surfaces can be excited by near infrared light (NIR), with rare earth nanoparticles to upconvert the NIR light to visible range and adsorb by Au nanoparticles, supported by titanium oxide porous film on titanium implants. Under NIR irradiation, the implant converts the energy of phonon to hot electrons and lattice vibrations, while the former flows directly to the contact substance or partially reacts with the surrounding to generate reactive oxygen species, and the latter leads to the local temperature increase. The biofilm or microbes on the implant surface can be eradicated by NIR treatment in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, the surface exhibits superior biocompatibility for cell survival, adhesion, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation, which provides the foundation for osseointegration. In vivo implantation experiments demonstrate osseointegration is also promoted. This work thus demonstrates NIR&#8208;generated electrons can sequentially eradicate biofilms and regulate the osteogenic process, providing new solutions to fabricate efficient implant surfaces.

         <title>Designing Chemically Replaced Interfacial Layer via Unveiling the Influence of Zn Crystal Facets for Practical Zn&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unveiling the effect of Zn crystal facets in Sn&#8208;based chemical replacement reaction (CRR), a Sn&#8208;based interfacial architecture (ZnTCF@Sn) via a novel two&#8208;step CRR is developed. Owing to its unique crystallographic (high zincophilicity and surface energy), morphological (abundant active sites and uniform current/Zn2+ flux), and compositional (suppressed side reactions of metallic Sn) merits, ZnTCF@Sn can approach a practical Zn&#8208;metal anode.








Abstract
Zn metal anodes (ZMAs) undergo irregular deposition and unfavorable side reactions, which hinders the practical application of aqueous rechargeable Zn metal batteries (ARZMBs). Chemical replacement reaction (CRR) strategies can achieve stable ZMAs, but the effect of the crystal facets of metallic Zn as reductants remains poorly understood. In this study, based on the observation that preferentially exposed Zn crystal facets affect the surface characteristics of chemically replaced layers in Sn&#8208;based CRR, a multifunctional Sn&#8208;based interfacial layer (ZnTCF@Sn) is designed on the Zn with textured crystal facets using a novel two&#8208;step CRR process. ZnTCF@Sn simultaneously provides abundant zincophilic sites and high surface energy and homogenizes the distribution of current/Zn2+ flux, resulting in fast electrochemical kinetics and dendrite&#8208;free deposition. Furthermore, the uniform Sn coverage on the ZnTCF@Sn surface inhibits side reactions and enhances reversibility during Zn deposition/dissolution. Thus, the ZnTCF@Sn achieves exceptional cyclability over 1200&#160;h even under harsh operating conditions with a cumulative capacity of 24 Ah cm&#8722;2. This study contributes to the development of practical ARZMBs by providing new insights into the effect of the Zn crystal facets on the surface modification of ZMAs through various CRRs.

         <title>Rational Medium&#8208;Range Charge Transfer Strategy Toward Highly Efficient Violet&#8208;Blue Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Narrowed Emission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here the wide&#8208;bandgap emitter fusing two ultraviolet multiple resonance fragments via a unique double&#8208;halide cyclized coupling reaction is presented. The resulting molecule can simultaneously achieve efficient violet&#8208;blue emission and narrowed spectra. The fabricated violet&#8208;blue electroluminescent device exhibits ideal performances with a high maximum external quantum efficiency of 20.5%.








Abstract
The spectral narrowing engineering of pure&#8208;organic emitters attracts great research interests in realizing high color purity. Here, the adjusted medium&#8208;range charge transfer (MCT) strategy of TIC&#8208;BO with rigid planar structure by fusing two typical UV&#8208;emitting multiple resonance (MR) fragments via the ingenious double&#8208;halide cyclized coupling reaction is reported. The resulting TIC&#8208;BO with MCT nature shows efficient violet&#8208;blue emission in dilute toluene and evaporated host&#8211;guest films, and desirably narrowed spectra are achieved by the suppression of structural relaxation and the shortened charge transfer states. The single&#8208;doped device with TIC&#8208;BO as emitter shows narrowed violet&#8208;blue electroluminescence peaked at 428&#160;nm with full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 43&#160;nm (0.28&#160;eV), and the Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage coordinates of (0.160, 0.050). A maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 20.50% is achieved, which is among the best results of the corresponding violet&#8208;blue emitting region. Further introduction of a stronger electron&#8208;donating carbazole group makes TIC&#8208;BNO exhibit red&#8208;shifted sky&#8208;blue emission with MR&#8208;dominant properties, and good device performance is received with EQEmax of 34.58%. The outstanding performances of TIC&#8208;BO successfully demonstrate the significance and prospect of the proposed molecular design strategy.

         <title>High&#8208;Confidentiality X&#8208;Ray Imaging Encryption Using Prolonged Imperceptible Radioluminescence Memory Scintillators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Existing X&#8208;ray imaging technologies have difficulty in protecting against information leakage from brute force attacks through trial and error. In this study, high&#8208;confidential 3D X&#8208;ray imaging encryption is achieved by fabricating ultralong imperceptible radioluminescence memory films.








Abstract
X&#8208;ray imaging plays an increasingly crucial role in clinical radiography, industrial inspection, and military applications. However, current X&#8208;ray imaging technologies have difficulty in protecting against information leakage caused by brute force attacks via trial&#8208;and&#8208;error. Here high&#8208;confidentiality X&#8208;ray imaging encryption by fabricating ultralong radioluminescence memory films composed of lanthanide&#8208;activated nanoscintillators (NaLuF4: Gd3+ or Ce3+) with imperceptible purely&#8208;ultraviolet (UV) emission is reported. Mechanistic investigations unveil that ultralong X&#8208;ray memory is attributed to the long&#8208;lived trapping of thermalized charge carriers within Frenkel defect states and subsequent slow release in the form of imperceptible radioluminescence. The encrypted X&#8208;ray imaging can be securely stored in the memory film for more than 7 days and optically decoded by perovskite nanocrystal. Importantly, this encryption strategy can protect X&#8208;ray imaging information against brute force trial&#8208;and&#8208;error attacks through the perception of lifetime change in the persistent radioluminescence. It is further demonstrated that the as&#8208;fabricated flexible memory film enables achieving of 3D X&#8208;ray imaging encryption of curved objects with a high spatial resolution of 20 lp/mm and excellent recyclability. This study provides valuable insights into the fundamental understanding of X&#8208;ray&#8208;to&#8208;UV conversion in nanocrystal lattices and opens up a new avenue toward the development of high&#8208;confidential 3D X&#8208;ray imaging encryption technologies.

         <title>All&#8208;Inorganic Polyoxometalates Act as Superchaotropic Membrane Carriers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inorganic anions of the polyoxometalate type display a new biological activity: They efficiently transport cationic peptides across lipidic and cellular membranes. This function is related to their superchaotropic nature, resulting in strong and concomitant interactions with peptides and lipids. Mixed&#8208;metal Keggin&#8208;type anions show the required hydrolytic stability and sufficiently low charge density that are prerequisites for the desirable carrier utility.








Abstract
Polyoxometalates (POMs) are known antitumoral, antibacterial, antiviral, and anticancer agents and considered as next&#8208;generation metallodrugs. Herein, a new biological functionality in neutral physiological media, where selected mixed&#8208;metal POMs are sufficiently stable and able to affect membrane transport of impermeable, hydrophilic, and cationic peptides (heptaarginine, heptalysine, protamine, and polyarginine) is reported. The uptake is observed in both, model membranes as well as cells, and attributed to the superchaotropic properties of the polyoxoanions. In view of the structural diversity of POMs these findings pave the way toward their biomedical application in drug delivery or for cell&#8208;biological uptake studies with biological effector molecules or staining agents.

         <dc:description>
A universal F4&#8208;modified strategy implements on M&#8208;BDC (M = Zr, Zn, Ce, Fe) to assemble high performance quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte, enabling the fast Li+ transport by chemical complexation and phase conversion among F&#8208;sites and poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) chains. The chemical trapping of TFSI&#8722; induces the homogeneous interface deposition, displaying enhanced capacity, rate performance in both coin cell and pouch battery.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) based on metal organic framework (MOF) and polymer mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) have shown great promotions in both lithium&#8208;ion conduction and interfacial resistance in lithium metal batteries (LMBs). However, the unwanted structural evolution and the and the obscure electrochemical reaction mechanism among two phases limit their further optimization and commercial application. Herein, fluorine&#8208;modified zirconium MOF with diverse F&#8208;quantities is synthesized, denoted as Zr&#8208;BDC&#8208;Fx (x = 0, 2, 4), to assemble high performance quais&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes (QSSEs) with PVDF&#8208;HFP. The chemical complexation of F&#8208;sites in Zr&#8208;BDC&#8208;F4 stabilized PVDF&#8208;HFP chains in &#946;&#8208;phase and disordered oscillation with enhanced charge transfer and Li transmit property. Besides, the porous confinement and electronegativity of F&#8208;groups enhanced the capture and dissociation of TFSI&#8208; anions and the homogeneous deposition of LiF solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), promoting the high&#8208;efficient transport of Li+ ions and inhibiting the growth of Li dendrites. The superb specific capacities in high&#8208;loaded Li.

         <title>Recycled Tandem Catalysts Promising Ultralow Overpotential Li&#8208;CO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One critical challenge&#160;of lithium&#8208;carbon dioxide (Li&#8208;CO2) batteries&#160;is to develop highly efficient and low&#8208;cost catalysts with precise structure. A tandem catalyst with an in&#8208;built electric field is elaborately recycled from the spent batteries and exhibits remarkable bidirectional activities. This work affords new opportunities to fabricate low&#8208;cost electrocatalysts and inspires fresh perceptions of interfacial regulation to engineer better Li&#8208;CO2 batteries.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;carbon dioxide (Li&#8208;CO2) batteries are regarded as a prospective technology to relieve the pressure of greenhouse emissions but are confronted with sluggish CO2 redox kinetics and low energy efficiency. Developing highly efficient and low&#8208;cost catalysts to boost bidirectional activities is craved but remains a huge challenge. Herein, derived from the spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries, a tandem catalyst is subtly synthesized and significantly accelerates the CO2 reduction and evolution reactions (CO2RR and CO2ER) kinetics with an in&#8208;built electric field (BEF). Combining with the theoretical calculations and advanced characterization techniques, this work reveals that the designed interface&#8208;induced BEF regulates the adsorption/decomposition of the intermediates during CO2RR and CO2ER, endowing the recycled tandem catalyst with excellent bidirectional activities. As a result, the spent electronics&#8208;derived tandem catalyst exhibits remarkable bidirectional catalytic performance, such as an ultralow voltage gap of 0.26&#160;V and an ultrahigh energy efficiency of 92.4%. Profoundly, this work affords new opportunities to fabricate low&#8208;cost electrocatalysts from recycled spent electronics and inspires fresh perceptions of interfacial regulation including but not limited to BEF to engineer better Li&#8208;CO2 batteries.

&lt;p&gt;One critical challenge&#160;of lithium-carbon dioxide (Li-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) batteries&#160;is to develop highly efficient and low-cost catalysts with precise structure. A tandem catalyst with an in-built electric field is elaborately recycled from the spent batteries and exhibits remarkable bidirectional activities. This work affords new opportunities to fabricate low-cost electrocatalysts and inspires fresh perceptions of interfacial regulation to engineer better Li-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithium-carbon dioxide (Li-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) batteries are regarded as a prospective technology to relieve the pressure of greenhouse emissions but are confronted with sluggish CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; redox kinetics and low energy efficiency. Developing highly efficient and low-cost catalysts to boost bidirectional activities is craved but remains a huge challenge. Herein, derived from the spent lithium-ion batteries, a tandem catalyst is subtly synthesized and significantly accelerates the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction and evolution reactions (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ER) kinetics with an in-built electric field (BEF). Combining with the theoretical calculations and advanced characterization techniques, this work reveals that the designed interface-induced BEF regulates the adsorption/decomposition of the intermediates during CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ER, endowing the recycled tandem catalyst with excellent bidirectional activities. As a result, the spent electronics-derived tandem catalyst exhibits remarkable bidirectional catalytic performance, such as an ultralow voltage gap of 0.26&#160;V and an ultrahigh energy efficiency of 92.4%. Profoundly, this work affords new opportunities to fabricate low-cost electrocatalysts from recycled spent electronics and inspires fresh perceptions of interfacial regulation including but not limited to BEF to engineer better Li-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Zymogens and Transmembrane Activation of Transcription in Synthetic Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
In this work, we engineer synthetic cells equipped with an artificial signaling pathway that connects an extracellular trigger event to the activation of intracellular transcription. Learning from nature, we do so via an engineering of responsive enzymes, such that activation of enzymatic activity can be triggered by an external biochemical stimulus. We engineer reversibly deactivated creatine kinase to achieve triggered production of ATP, and a reversibly deactivated nucleic acid polymerase for on&#8208;demand synthesis of RNA. We also design an extracellular, enzyme&#8208;activated production of a diffusible zymogen activator. The key achievement of our work is that we illustrate the importance of cellularity whereby the separation of biochemical partners is essential to resolve their incompatibility, to enable transcription within the confines of a synthetic cell. The herein designed biochemical pathway and the engineered synthetic cells are arguably primitive compared to their natural counterpart. Nevertheless, our results present a significant step towards the design of synthetic cells with responsive behaviour, en route from abiotic to life&#8208;like cell mimics.

         <title>2H&#8208;2&#160;M Phase Control of WSe2 Nanosheets by Se Enrichment Toward Enhanced Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The phase control of transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) is an intriguing approach for tuning the electronic structure towards extensive applications. In this study, WSe2 nanosheets synthesized via a colloidal reaction exhibited a phase conversion from semiconducting 2H to metallic 2&#160;M under Se&#8208;rich growth conditions (i.e., increasing the concentration of Se precursor or lowering the growth temperature). High&#8208;resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy images were used to identify the stacking sequence of the 2&#160;M phase, which is distinctive from that of the 1T&#8242; phase. First&#8208;principles calculations employing various Se&#8208;rich models (intercalation and substitution) indicated that Se enrichment induces conversion to the 2&#160;M phase. The 2&#160;M phase WSe2 nanosheets with the Se excess exhibited enhanced electrocatalytic performance in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In situ X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure studies suggested that the excess Se atoms in the 2&#160;M phase WSe2 enhanced the HER catalytic activity, which was supported by the Gibbs free energy (&#916;GH*) of H adsorption and the Fermi abundance function. These results provide an appealing strategy for phase control of TMD catalysts.

         <title>A Multi&#8208;Scale Approach to Simulate the Nonlinear Optical Response of Molecular Nanomaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Nonlinear optics is essential for many recent photonic technologies. Here, we&#160;introduce a novel multi&#8208;scale approach to simulate the nonlinear optical response of molecular nanomaterials combining ab initio quantum&#8208;chemical and classical Maxwell&#8208;scattering computations. In this approach, the first hyperpolarizability tensor is computed with time&#8208;dependent density&#8208;functional theory and incorporated into a multi&#8208;scattering formalism that considers the optical interaction between neighboring molecules. Such incorporation is achieved by a novel object: the Hyper&#8208;Transition(T)&#8208;matrix. With this object at hand, the nonlinear optical response from single molecules and also from entire photonic devices can be computed, including the full tensorial and dispersive nature of the optical response of the molecules, as well as the optical interaction between different molecules as, for example, in the lattice of a molecular crystal. To demonstrate the applicability of our&#160;novel approach, the generation of a second&#8208;harmonic signal from a thin film of an Urea molecular crystal is computed and compared to more traditional simulations. Furthermore, an optical cavity is designed, which enhances the second&#8208;harmonic response of the molecular film up to more than two orders of magnitude. Our&#160;approach is highly versatile and accurate and can be the working horse for the future exploration of nonlinear photonic molecular materials in structured photonic&#160;environments.

         <title>Nuclear Spin&#8208;Depleted, Isotopically Enriched 70Ge/28Si70Ge Quantum Wells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The p&#8208;symmetry of the hole wavefunction is associated with a weaker hyperfine interaction, which makes hole spin qubits attractive candidates for quantum processors. However, recent studies demonstrated that hole qubits are still very sensitive to nuclear spin bath, thus highlighting the need for nuclear spin&#8208;free Ge qubits to suppress this decoherence channel. Herein, this work demonstrates the epitaxial growth of 73Ge&#8208;depleted isotopically enriched 70Ge/SiGe quantum wells. The growth was&#160;achieved by reduced pressure chemical vapor deposition using isotopically purified monogermane 70GeH4 and monosilane 28SiH4 with an isotopic purity higher than 99.9 % and 99.99 %, respectively. The quantum wells consist of a series of 70Ge/SiGe heterostructures grown on Si wafers using a Ge virtual substrate and a graded SiGe buffer layer. The isotopic purity is investigated using atom probe tomography following an analytical procedure addressing the discrepancies in the isotopic content caused by the overlap of isotope peaks in mass spectra. The nuclear spin background in the quantum wells was&#160;found to be sensitive to the growth conditions. The lowest concentration of nuclear spin&#8208;full isotopes 73Ge and 29Si in the heterostructure was&#160;established at 0.01 % in the Ge quantum well and SiGe barriers. The measured average distance between nuclear spins reaches 3&#8208;4 nm in 70Ge/28Si70Ge, which is an order of magnitude larger than in natural Ge/SiGe heterostructures.

         <title>Additive Manufacturing of Poly(phenylene Sulfide) Aerogels via Simultaneous Material Extrusion And Thermally&#8208;Induced Phase Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Additive manufacturing (AM) of aerogels increases the achievable geometric complexity, and affords fabrication of hierarchically&#8208;porous structures. In this work, a custom heated material extrusion (MEX) device prints aerogels of poly(phenylene sulfide) (PPS), an engineering thermoplastic, via in&#8208;situ thermally induced phase separation (TIPS). First, pre&#8208;prepared solid gel inks are dissolved at high temperatures in the heated extruder barrel to form a homogeneous polymer solution. Solutions are then extruded onto a room&#8208;temperature substrate, where printed roads maintain their bead shape and rapidly solidify via TIPS, thus enabling layer&#8208;wise MEX AM. Printed gels are converted to aerogels via post&#8208;processing solvent exchange and freeze&#8208;drying. This work explores the effect of ink composition on printed aerogel morphology and thermo&#8208;mechanical properties. Scanning electron microscopy micrographs reveal complex hierarchical microstructures that are compositionally dependent. Printed aerogels demonstrate tailorable porosities (50.0 &#8211; 74.8%) and densities (0.345 &#8211; 0.684&#160;g cm&#8722;3), which align well with cast aerogel analogs. Differential scanning calorimetry thermograms indicate printed aerogels are highly crystalline (&#8764; 43%), suggesting that printing does not inhibit the solidification process occurring during TIPS (polymer crystallization). Uniaxial compression testing reveals that compositionally&#8208;dependent microstructure governs aerogel mechanical behavior, with compressive moduli ranging from 33.0 to 106.5&#160;MPa.

         <title>Pcna as Protein&#8208;Based Nanoruler for Sub&#8208;10&#160;Nm Fluorescence Imaging</title>

Abstract
Super&#8208;resolution microscopy has revolutionized biological imaging enabling direct insight into cellular structures and protein arrangements with so far unmatched spatial resolution. Today, refined single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy methods achieve spatial resolutions in the one&#8208;digit nanometer range. As the race for molecular resolution fluorescence imaging with visible light continues, reliable biologically compatible reference structures will become essential to validate the resolution power. Here, we introduce PicoRulers (Protein&#8208;based Imaging Calibration Optical Rulers), multilabeled oligomeric proteins designed as advanced molecular nanorulers for super&#8208;resolution fluorescence imaging. We used genetic code expansion (GCE) to site&#8208;specifically incorporate three non&#8208;canonical amino acids (ncAAs) into the homotrimeric proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) at 6&#160;nm distances. Bioorthogonal click labeling with tetrazine&#8208;dyes and tetrazine&#8208;functionalized oligonucleotides allows efficient labeling of the PicoRuler with minimal linkage error. We used time&#8208;resolved photoswitching fingerprint analysis to demonstrate the successful synthesis and DNA&#8208;PAINT to resolve 6&#160;nm PCNA PicoRulers. Since PicoRulers maintain their structural integrity under cellular conditions they represent ideal molecular nanorulers for benchmarking the performance of super&#8208;resolution imaging techniques, particularly in complex biological environments.

         <title>Trace Water in Lead Iodide Affecting Perovskite Crystal Nucleation Limits The Performance of Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The experimental replicability of highly efficient perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has been a persistent challenge faced by laboratories worldwide. Although trace impurities in raw materials can impact the experimental reproducibility of high&#8208;performance PSCs, the in situ study of how trace impurities affect perovskite film growth has never been investigated. In our study, we shed light on the impact of inevitable water contamination in lead iodide (PbI2) on the replicability of device performance, mainly depending on the synthesis methods of PbI2. Through synchrotron&#8208;based structure characterization, we uncover that even slight additions of water to PbI2 accelerate the crystallization process in the perovskite layer during annealing. However, this accelerated crystallization also results in an imbalance of charge&#8208;carrier mobilities, leading to a degradation in device performance and reduced longevity of the solar cells. We also find that anhydrous PbI2 promotes a homogenous nucleation process and improves perovskite film growth. Finally, our PSCs achieve a remarkable certified power conversion efficiency of 24.3%. This breakthrough demonstrates the significance of understanding and precisely managing the water content in PbI2 to ensure the experimental replicability of high&#8208;efficiency PSCs.

         <title>Scalable Non&#8208;Volatile Tuning of Photonic Computational Memories by Automated Silicon Ion Implantation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Photonic Integrated Circuits (PICs) are revolutionizing the realm of information technology, promising unprecedented speeds and efficiency in data processing and optical communication. However, the nanoscale precision required to fabricate these circuits at scale presents significant challenges, due to the need to maintain consistency across wavelength&#8208;selective components, which necessitates individualized adjustments after fabrication. Harnessing spectral alignment by automated silicon ion implantation, in this work scalable and non&#8208;volatile photonic computational memories are demonstrated in high quality resonant devices. Precise spectral trimming of large&#8208;scale photonic ensembles from few picometers to several nanometres is achieved with long&#8208;term stability and marginal loss penalty. Based on this approach spectrally aligned photonic memory and computing systems for general matrix multiplication are demonstrated, enabling wavelength multiplexed integrated architectures at large scales.

         <title>Intestine&#8208;targeted Explosive Hydrogel Microsphere Promotes Uric Acid Excretion for Gout Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Purines could be converted into uric acid in the gut microenvironment, triggering metabolic diseases, especially gout, while the uric acid excretion is impaired. However, increasing uric acid excretion remains a challenge. In this study, we prepared a uricase&#8208;containing intestine&#8208;targeted explosive hydrogel microspheres via gas&#8208;shearing microfluidics for mucosal immobilization of uricase, to realize gout inhibition through a novel transporter protein regulation pathway to accelerate the uric acid excretion for the first time. After oral administration of hydrogel microspheres, uricase could be controllably released in the intestine to hydrolyze uric acid preliminarily for hydrogen peroxide production. Once exposed in the intestinal specific catalase, hydrogen peroxide would further generate a local hyperoxic microenvironment beneficial for dopamine polymerization, thereby immobilizing uricase in intestinal mucosa finally. Through this cascade reaction, only a small amount of uricase is required for local immobilization to in&#8208;situ up&#8208;regulate uric acid transporter proteins of intestinal epithelial cells, excreting uric acid from the epithelial cells into the intestines to be excreted, lowering the systemic uric acid level. In vitro and in vivo studies confirmed the precisely intestinal delivery of dopamine and uricase through intestine&#8208;targeted explosive microspheres. In vitro evaluation demonstrated that the uric acid level in human fecal samples from gout patients could be significantly reduced by up to 37% by the mimic mucosa&#8208;immobilized uricase on the isolated porcine tissues. In vivo experiments in mouse hyperuricemia model and acute gouty arthritis model confirmed that microspheres could effectively accelerate intestinal uric acid excretion, effectively increasing fecal uric acid excretion by up to 27.6% and reducing blood uric acid by up to 71%. In addition, 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing showed that the microspheres optimized intestinal flora composition, with a significant increase in probiotic bacteria such as Akkermansia muciniphila and Verrucomicrobiales, and inhibited some common intestinal bacteria in gout patients such as Bacteroidetes, thereby improving intestinal homeostasis. In conclusion, we developed a unique inducing pathway via the small intestine mucosal layer in&#8208;situ regulation to firstly realize an efficient uric acid intestinal excretion for gout therapy.

         <title>Dielectric Gels with Microphase Separation for Wide&#8208;Range And Self&#8208;Damping Pressure Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Omnipresent vibrations pose a significant challenge to flexible pressure sensors by inducing unstable output signals and curtailing their operational lifespan. Conventional soft sensing materials possess adequate elasticity but prove inadequate in countering vibrations. Moreover, the utilization of conventional highly&#8208;damping materials for sensing is challenging due to their substantial hysteresis. To tackle this dilemma, dielectric gels with controlled in situ microphase separation have been developed, leveraging the miscibility disparity between copolymers and solvents. The resulting gels exhibit exceptional compression stress, remarkable dielectric constant, and exceptional damping capabilities. Furthermore, flexible pressure sensors based on these microphase&#8208;separated gels show a wide detection range and low detection limit, more importantly, excellent sensing performance on vibrating surfaces. This work offers high potentials for applying flexible pressure sensors in complex practical scenarios and opens up new avenues for applications in soft electronics, biomimetic robots, and intelligent sensing.

         <title>Core&#8211;Shell Perovskite Quantum Dots for Highly Selective Room&#8208;Temperature Spin Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Circularly polarized light (CPL) is a crucial light source with a wide variety of potential applications such as magnetic recording, and three&#8208;dimensional display. In this study, we develop core&#8211;shell heterostructured perovskite quantum dots (QDs) for room&#8208;temperature spin&#8208;polarized light&#8208;emitting diode (spin&#8208;LEDs). Specifically, a 2D chiral perovskite shell is deposited onto the achiral 3D inorganic perovskite (CsPbBr3) core. Owing to the chiral&#8208;induced spin selectivity effect, the spin state of the injected charge carriers is biased when they are transmitted through the 2D chiral shell. The spin&#8208;controlled carriers then radiatively recombine inside the CsPbBr3 emissive core, resulting in CPL emission. We demonstrate that the (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;1&#8208;(2&#8208;(naphthyl)ethylamine) (R&#8208;/S&#8208;NEA) 2D chiral cations enhance the spin polarization degree due to their strong chiroptical properties. Systematical defect analyses confirmed that 2D chiral cations (i.e., R&#8208;/S&#8208;NEA) successfully passivate halide vacancies at the surface of the CsPbBr3 QDs, thereby attaining a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 78%. Moreover, the spin&#8208;LEDs prepared with core&#8211;shell QDs achieve a maximum external quantum efficiency of 5.47% and circularly polarized electroluminescence with a polarization degree (PCP&#8208;EL) of 12% at room temperature. Finally, various patterns fabricated by inkjet printing the core&#8211;shell QDs emitted strong CPL, highlighting their potential as an emitter for next&#8208;generation displays.

Specifically, a 2D chiral perovskite shell is deposited onto the achiral 3D inorganic perovskite (CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) core. Owing to the chiral-induced spin selectivity effect, the spin state of the injected charge carriers is biased when they are transmitted through the 2D chiral shell. The spin-controlled carriers then radiatively recombine inside the CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; emissive core, resulting in CPL emission. We demonstrate that the (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)- and (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-1-(2-(naphthyl)ethylamine) (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;-/&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-NEA) 2D chiral cations enhance the spin polarization degree due to their strong chiroptical properties. Systematical defect analyses confirmed that 2D chiral cations (i.e., &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;-/&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-NEA) successfully passivate halide vacancies at the surface of the CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; QDs, thereby attaining a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 78%. Moreover, the spin-LEDs prepared with core&#8211;shell QDs achieve a maximum external quantum efficiency of 5.47% and circularly polarized electroluminescence with a polarization degree (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;CP-EL&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;) of 12% at room temperature. Finally, various patterns fabricated by inkjet printing the core&#8211;shell QDs emitted strong CPL, highlighting their potential as an emitter for next-generation displays.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Alkoxythiophene Directed Fibrillization of Polymer Donor for Efficient Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Realizing fibrillar molecular framework is highly encouraged in organic solar cells (OSCs) due to the merit of efficient charge carrier transport. This is however mainly achieved via the chemical structural design of photovoltaic semiconductors. In this work, through the ultilization of three alkoxythiophene additives, T&#8208;2OMe, T&#8208;OEH and T&#8208;2OEH, the intermolecular interactions among a series of BDT&#8208;type polymer donors, i.e., PM6, D18, PBDB&#8208;T, PTB7&#8208;Th, are tuned to self&#8208;assemble into nano&#8208;fibrils during solution casting. X&#8208;ray technique and molecular dynamics simulation reveal that the alkoxythiophene with (2&#8208;ethylhexyl)oxy (&#8208;OEH) chains could attach on the 2&#8208;ethylhexyl (EH) chains of these polymer donors, and promote their self&#8208;assembly into one dimensional nanofibrils, in their neat films as well as photovoltaic blends with L8&#8208;BO. By adapting these fibrillar polymer donors to construct pseudo&#8208;bulk heterojunction (P&#8208;BHJ) OSCs via layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer deposition, generally improved device performance are received, with PCEs enhanced from 18.2% to 19.2% (certified 18.96%) and from 17.9% to 18.7% for the PM6/L8&#8208;BO and D18/L8&#8208;BO devices respectively. This work provides a physical approach to promote the fibrillar charge transport channels for efficient photovoltaics.

         <title>Strain Engineering in Perovskites: Mutual Insight on Oxides and Halides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Perovskite materials have garnered significant attention over the past decades due to their applications, not only in electronic materials such as dielectrics, piezoelectrics, ferroelectrics, and superconductors but also in optoelectronic devices like solar cells and light emitting diodes. This interest arises from their versatile combinations and physiochemical tunability. While strain engineering is a recognized powerful tool for tailoring material properties, its collaborative impact on both oxides and halides remains understudied. Herein, we discuss strain engineering in perovskites for energy conversion devices, providing mutual insight into both oxides and halides. We present the various experimental methods for applying strain by using thermal mismatch, lattice mismatch, defects, doping, light illumination, and flexible substrates. In addition, we describe the main factors that are influenced by strain, categorized as structure (e.g., symmetry breaking, octahedral distortion), bandgap, chemical reactivity, and defect formation energy. After that, recent progress in strain engineering for perovskite oxides and halides for energy conversion devices is introduced. We suggest promising methods for enhancing the performance of energy conversion devices using perovskites through strain engineering.

         <title>Insights into the Si&#9472;H Bonding Configuration at the Amorphous/Crystalline Silicon Interface of Silicon Heterojunction Solar Cells by Raman and FTIR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 47, November 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is shown that Raman spectroscopy can be used to investigate the silicon&#8208;hydrogen (Si&#9472;H) bonding configuration of thinhydrogenated amorphous silicon layers directly on silicon heterojunction solar cells. Additionally, a detailed comparison of the Si&#8211;H vibrational spectra near the amorphous/crystalline silicon interface measured by Fourier transform infrared and Raman spectroscopy is performed.








Abstract
In silicon heterojunction solar cell technology, thin layers of hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a&#8208;Si:H) are applied as passivating contacts to the crystalline silicon (c&#8208;Si) wafer. Thus, the properties of the a&#8208;Si:H is crucial for the performance of the solar cells. One important property of a&#8208;Si:H is its microstructure which can be characterized by the microstructure parameter R based on Si&#9472;H bond stretching vibrations. A common method to determine R is Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) absorption measurement which, however, is difficult to perform on solar cells for various reasons like the use of textured Si wafers and the presence of conducting oxide contact layers. Here, it is demonstrated that Raman spectroscopy is suitable to determine the microstructure of bulk a&#8208;Si:H layers of 10&#160;nm or less on textured c&#8208;Si underneath indium tin oxide as conducting oxide. A detailed comparison of FTIR and Raman spectra is performed and significant differences in the microstructure parameter are obtained by both methods with decreasing a&#8208;Si:H film thickness.

         <title>Multifunctional, Hybrid Materials Design via Spray&#8208;Drying: Much more than Just Drying</title>

         <dc:description>
Spray&#8208;drying is a versatile and powerful method for designing multifunctional and hybrid materials. Its potential for different material formation strategies and different application scenarios, as well as its advantages and challenges, are highlighted.








Abstract
Spray&#8208;drying is a popular and well&#8208;known &#8220;drying tool&#8221; for engineers. This perspective&#160;highlights that, beyond this application, spray&#8208;drying is a very interesting and powerful tool for materials chemists to enable the design of multifunctional and hybrid materials. Upon spray&#8208;drying, the confined space of a liquid droplet is narrowed down, and its ingredients are forced together upon &#8220;falling dry.&#8221; As &#160;detailed in this article, this enables the following material formation strategies either individually or even in combination: nanoparticles and/or molecules can be assembled; precipitation reactions as well as chemical syntheses can be performed; and templated materials can be designed. Beyond this, fragile moieties can be processed, or &#8220;precursor materials&#8221; be prepared. Post&#8208;treatment of spray&#8208;dried objects eventually enables the next level in the design of complex materials. Using spray&#8208;drying to design (particulate) materials comes with many advantages&#8212;but also with many challenges&#8212;all of which are outlined here.&#160;It is&#160;believed that multifunctional, hybrid materials, made via spray&#8208;drying, enable very unique property combinations that are particularly highly promising in myriad applications&#8212;of which catalysis, diagnostics, purification, storage, and information are highlighted.

A new MXene structure is reported in this paper, and the improved structure is rationally designed by computational modeling, which greatly prevents the buildup of MXene nanosheets, improves the stability of the structure, and creates a wide electron transfer channel, and the capacitance contribution of this structure is up to 86.3 %.

Abstract
The preparation of highly conductive media and the construction of conducting channels play a crucial role in improving the electrical conductivity of electrically conductive adhesives. Therefore, a new MXene structure is reported in this paper, and the improved structure is rationally designed by computational modeling, which greatly prevents the buildup of MXene nanosheets, improves the stability of the structure, and creates a wide electron transfer channel, and the capacitance contribution of this structure is up to 86.3%. By mixing MXene modified with Ag&#8208;plated copper powder in a quantitative relationship to form high conductive media, the electrical conductivity is largely improved and the defect of low electron transfer rate of conventional conductive fillers is broken. The potential value of high conductive media is largely exploited using high throughput and machine learning methods, and here we show that the resistivity has reached 9.668 &#215; 10&#8722;7 &#937; m. The first principles investigate the conductive channels and electron transfer pathways of high&#8208;conductive media at the atomic level, further revealing the mechanism of action of high&#8208;conductive media. This study is also the first report on the application of MXene to high&#8208;conductive media.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The preparation of highly conductive media and the construction of conducting channels play a crucial role in improving the electrical conductivity of electrically conductive adhesives. Therefore, a new MXene structure is reported in this paper, and the improved structure is rationally designed by computational modeling, which greatly prevents the buildup of MXene nanosheets, improves the stability of the structure, and creates a wide electron transfer channel, and the capacitance contribution of this structure is up to 86.3%. By mixing MXene modified with Ag-plated copper powder in a quantitative relationship to form high conductive media, the electrical conductivity is largely improved and the defect of low electron transfer rate of conventional conductive fillers is broken. The potential value of high conductive media is largely exploited using high throughput and machine learning methods, and here we show that the resistivity has reached 9.668 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;7&lt;/sup&gt; &#937; m. The first principles investigate the conductive channels and electron transfer pathways of high-conductive media at the atomic level, further revealing the mechanism of action of high-conductive media. This study is also the first report on the application of MXene to high-conductive media.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lattice&#8208;Gradient Perovskite KTaO3 Films for an Ultrastable and Low&#8208;Dose X&#8208;Ray Detector</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 47, November 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lattice&#8208;gradient perovskite KTaO3 films have been grown via a solution epitaxy. A direct&#8208;type X&#8208;ray detector made of such film demonstrates long&#8208;term stability and a low detection limit, allowing it to obtain high&#8208;quality imaging. These achievements have been attributed to a built&#8208;in electric field generated by the lattice gradient within the films.








Abstract
Conventional indirect X&#8208;ray detectors employ scintillating phosphors to convert X&#8208;ray photons into photodiode&#8208;detectable visible photons, leading to low conversion efficiencies, low spatial resolutions, and optical crosstalk. Consequently, X&#8208;ray detectors that directly convert photons into electric signals have long been desired for high&#8208;performance medical imaging and industrial inspection. Although emerging hybrid inorganic&#8211;organic halide perovskites, such as CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbBr3, exhibit high sensitivity, they have salient drawbacks including structural instability, ion motion, and the use of toxic Pb. Here, this work reports an ultrastable, low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray detector comprising KTaO3 perovskite films epitaxially grown on a Nb&#8208;doped strontium titanate substrate using a low&#8208;cost solution method. The detector exhibits a stable photocurrent under high&#8208;dose irradiation, high&#8208;temperature (200 &#176;C), and aqueous conditions. Moreover, the prototype KTaO3&#8208;film&#8208;based detector exhibits a 150&#8208;fold higher sensitivity (3150 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1cm&#8722;2) and 150&#8208;fold lower detection limit (&lt;40 nGyair s&#8722;1) than those of commercial &#945;&#8208;Se&#8208;based direct detectors. Systematic investigations reveal that the high stability of the detector originates from the strong covalent bonds within the KTaO3 film, whereas the low detection limit is due to a lattice&#8208;gradient&#8208;driven built&#8208;in electric field and the high insulating property of KTaO3 film. This study unveils a new path toward the fabrication of green, stable, and low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray detectors using oxide perovskite films, which have significant application potential in medical imaging and security operations.

         <title>Hybrid Data&#8208;Driven Discovery of High&#8208;Performance Silver Selenide&#8208;Based Thermoelectric Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 47, November 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine learning leveraging literature data and actively collected experimental data can speed up optimizing new AgSe&#8208;based thermoelectric materials. The approach considers five different chemical elements, and with only seven rounds of active experimentation guided by Bayesian optimization, a 75% improvement in power factor is achieved, resulting in one of the best values in this material class (2100 &#181;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2).








Abstract
Optimizing material compositions often enhances thermoelectric performances. However, the large selection of possible base elements and dopants results in a vast composition design space that is too large to systematically search using solely domain knowledge. To address this challenge, a hybrid data&#8208;driven strategy that integrates Bayesian optimization (BO) and Gaussian process regression (GPR) is proposed to optimize the composition of five elements (Ag, Se, S, Cu, and Te) in AgSe&#8208;based thermoelectric materials. Data is collected from the literature to provide prior knowledge for the initial GPR model, which is updated by actively collected experimental data during the iteration between BO and experiments. Within seven iterations, the optimized AgSe&#8208;based materials prepared using a simple high&#8208;throughput ink mixing and blade coating method deliver a high power factor of 2100 &#181;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2, which is a 75% improvement from the baseline composite (nominal composition of Ag2Se1). The success of this study provides opportunities to generalize the demonstrated active machine learning technique to accelerate the development and optimization of a wide range of material systems with reduced experimental trials.

         <title>Bandgap Engineering of Melon using Highly Reduced Graphene Oxide for Enhanced Photoelectrochemical Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 47, November 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bandgap of melon is engineered with highly reduced graphene oxide (HRG). 1% HRG@melon nanocomposite shows a higher photocurrent density (71 &#181;A cm&#8722;2) in alkaline conditions than melon (24 &#181;A cm&#8722;2), which is increased with a hole scavenger to 630 &#181;A cm&#8722;2. First&#8208;principles calculations reveal that the addition of HRG leads to an improved photocatalytic HER via charge redistribution.









Abstract
The uncondensed form of polymeric carbon nitrides (PCN), generally known as melon, is a stacked 2D structure of poly(aminoimino)heptazine. Melon is used as a photocatalyst in solar energy conversion applications, but suffers from poor photoconversion efficiency due to weak optical absorption in the visible spectrum, high activation energy, and inefficient separation of photoexcited charge carriers. Experimental and theoretical studies are reported to engineer the bandgap of melon with highly reduced graphene oxide (HRG). Three HRG@melon nanocomposites with different HRG:melon ratios (0.5%, 1%, and 2%) are&#160;prepared. The 1% HRG@melon nanocomposite shows higher photocurrent density (71&#160;&#181;A cm&#8722;2) than melon (24&#160;&#181;A cm&#8722;2) in alkaline conditions. The addition of a hole scavenger further increases the photocurrent density to 630&#160;&#181;A cm&#8722;2 relative to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). These experimental results are&#160;validated by calculations using density functional theory (DFT), which revealed that HRG results in a significant charge redistribution and an improved photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).

         <title>A Self&#8208;Powered UV Photodetector With Ultrahigh Responsivity Based on 2D Perovskite Ferroelectric Films With Mixed Spacer Cations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 47, November 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;quality 2D ferroelectric perovskite films with mixed spacer cations (BA+ and BDA2+) are prepared for self&#8208;powered photodetectors (PDs). The self&#8208;powered ultraviolet (UV) PDs exhibit excellent photoelectric properties, together with excellent reproducibility and stability. After applying pressures to the PD, the maximum responsivities can be modulated by the piezo&#8211;phototronic effect with an effective enhancement ratio of 480%.








Abstract
Self&#8208;powered photodetectors (PDs) have the advantages of no external power requirement, wireless operation, and long life. Spontaneous ferroelectric polarizations can significantly increase built&#8208;in electric field intensity, showing great potential in self&#8208;powered photodetection. Moreover, ferroelectrics possess pyroelectric and piezoelectric properties, beneficial for enhancing self&#8208;powered PDs. 2D metal halide perovskites (MHPs), which have ferroelectric properties, are suitable for fabricating high&#8208;performance self&#8208;powered PDs. However, the research on 2D metal halide perovskites ferroelectrics focuses on growing bulk crystals. Herein, 2D ferroelectric perovskite films with mixed spacer cations for self&#8208;powered PDs are demonstrated by mixing Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP)&#8208;type and Dion&#8211;Jacobson (DJ)&#8208;type perovskite. The (BDA0.7(BA2)0.3)(EA)2Pb3Br10 film possesses, overall, the best film qualities with the best crystalline quality, lowest trap density, good phase purity, and obvious ferroelectricity. Based on the ferro&#8211;pyro&#8211;phototronic effect, the PD at 360&#160;nm exhibits excellent photoelectric properties, with an ultrahigh peak responsivity greater than 93 A W&#8722;1 and a detectivity of 2.5 &#215; 1015 Jones, together with excellent reproducibility and stability. The maximum responsivities can be modulated by piezo&#8211;phototronic effect with an effective enhancement ratio of 480%. This work will open up a new route of designing MHP ferroelectric films for high&#8208;performance PDs and offers the opportunity to utilize it for various optoelectronics applications.

&lt;p&gt;High-quality 2D ferroelectric perovskite films with mixed spacer cations (BA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and BDA&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) are prepared for self-powered photodetectors (PDs). The self-powered ultraviolet (UV) PDs exhibit excellent photoelectric properties, together with excellent reproducibility and stability. After applying pressures to the PD, the maximum responsivities can be modulated by the piezo&#8211;phototronic effect with an effective enhancement ratio of 480%.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-powered photodetectors (PDs) have the advantages of no external power requirement, wireless operation, and long life. Spontaneous ferroelectric polarizations can significantly increase built-in electric field intensity, showing great potential in self-powered photodetection. Moreover, ferroelectrics possess pyroelectric and piezoelectric properties, beneficial for enhancing self-powered PDs. 2D metal halide perovskites (MHPs), which have ferroelectric properties, are suitable for fabricating high-performance self-powered PDs. However, the research on 2D metal halide perovskites ferroelectrics focuses on growing bulk crystals. Herein, 2D ferroelectric perovskite films with mixed spacer cations for self-powered PDs are demonstrated by mixing Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP)-type and Dion&#8211;Jacobson (DJ)-type perovskite. The (BDA&lt;sub&gt;0.7&lt;/sub&gt;(BA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;)(EA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Pb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; film possesses, overall, the best film qualities with the best crystalline quality, lowest trap density, good phase purity, and obvious ferroelectricity. Based on the ferro&#8211;pyro&#8211;phototronic effect, the PD at 360&#160;nm exhibits excellent photoelectric properties, with an ultrahigh peak responsivity greater than 93 A W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a detectivity of 2.5 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; Jones, together with excellent reproducibility and stability. The maximum responsivities can be modulated by piezo&#8211;phototronic effect with an effective enhancement ratio of 480%. This work will open up a new route of designing MHP ferroelectric films for high-performance PDs and offers the opportunity to utilize it for various optoelectronics applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhanced Resonance for Facilitated Modulation of Large&#8208;Area Perovskite Films with Stable Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 47, November 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel hole transport material (HTM) based on N&#8208;C=O resonance structure is designed for modulation the crystallization and bottom&#8208;surface defects of perovskite films. Benefiting from the resonance interconversion (N&#8211;C=O and N+=C&#8211;O&#8722;) in HTM, the large&#8208;area inverted perovskite solar cells (IPSCs) reach a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 21.0% with excellent photo&#8208;thermal stability.








Abstract
Upscaling efficient and stable perovskite films is a challenging task in the industrialization of perovskite solar cells partly due to the lack of high&#8208;performance hole transport materials (HTMs), which can simultaneously promote hole transport and regulate the quality of perovskite films especially in inverted solar cells. Here, a novel HTM based on N&#8211;C = O resonance structure is designed for facilitating the modulation of the crystallization and bottom&#8208;surface defects of perovskite films. Benefiting from the resonance interconversion (N&#8211;C = O and N+ = C&#8211;O&#8722;) in donor&#8208;resonance&#8208;donor (D&#8208;r&#8208;D) architecture and interactions with uncoordinated Pb2+ in perovskite, the resulting D&#8208;r&#8208;D HTM with two donor units exhibits not only excellent hole extraction and transport capacities, but also efficient crystallization modulation of perovskite for high&#8208;quality photovoltaic films in large area. The D&#8208;r&#8208;D HTM&#8208;based large&#8208;area (1.02 cm2) devices exhibit high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) up to 21.0%. Moreover, the large&#8208;area devices have excellent photo&#8208;thermal stability, showing only a 2.6% reduction in PCE under continuous AM 1.5G light illumination at elevated temperature (&#8776;65&#160;&#176;C) for over 1320&#160;h without encapsulation.

         <title>Li2MnO3: A Catalyst for a Liquid Cl2 Electrode in Low&#8208;Temperature Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 47, November 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Below &#8722;35&#160;&#176;C, the anionic oxygen redox in Li2MnO3 is &#8220;frozen,&#8221; thus not contributing to the observed capacity. However, at low temperatures, Li2MnO3 catalyzes a reversible redox reaction of Cl2(l)/Cl&#8722; on its surface in aqueous 7 m&#160;LiCl.








Abstract
Li2MnO3 has been contemplated as a high&#8208;capacity cathode candidate for Li&#8208;ion batteries; however, it evolves oxygen during battery charging under ambient conditions, which hinders a reversible reaction. However, it is unclear if this irreversible process still holds under subambient conditions. Here, the low&#8208;temperature electrochemical properties of Li2MnO3 in an aqueous LiCl electrolyte are evaluated and a reversible discharge capacity of 302 mAh g&#8722;1 at a potential of 1.0&#160;V versus Ag/AgCl at &#8722;78 &#176;C with good rate capability and stable cycling performance, in sharp contrast to the findings in a typical Li2MnO3 cell cycled at room temperature, is observed. However, the results reveal that the capacity does not originate from the reversible oxygen oxidation in Li2MnO3 but the reversible Cl2(l)/Cl&#8722;(aq.) redox from the electrolyte. The results demonstrate the good catalytic properties of Li2MnO3 to promote the Cl2/Cl&#8722; redox at low temperatures.

         <title>Spider Silk&#8208;Inspired Binder Design for Flexible Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery with High Durability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 47, November 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by spider silks, a binder for flexible lithium&#8208;ion batteries is developed with &#946;&#8208;sheet nanocrystals and amorphous matrixes. The unique structure involves abundant reversible hydrogen bond arrays as well as cross&#8208;linked networks, resulting in excellent mechanical and bonding properties. The flexible batteries can maintain an integral electrode morphology and stable cycling during different tough deformations.








Abstract
The development of flexible lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) imposes demands on energy density and high mechanical durability simultaneously. Due to the limited deformability of electrodes, as well as the flat and smooth surface of the metal current collectors, stable/durable/reliable contact between electrode materials and the current collectors remains a challenge, in particular, for electrodes with high loading mass and heavily deformed batteries. Binders play an essential role in binding particles of electrode materials and adhering them to current collectors. Herein, inspired by spider silk, a binder for flexible LIBs is developed, which equips a cross&#8208;linked supramolecular poly(urethane&#8208;urea) to the polyacrylic acid. The binder imparts super high elastic restorability originating from the meticulously engineered hydrogen&#8208;bonding segments as well as extraordinary adhesion. The developed binder provides excellent flexibility and intact electrode morphologies without disintegration even when the electrode is largely deformed, enabling a stable cycling and voltage output even when the batteries are put under tough dynamic deformation tests. The flexible LIBs exhibit a high energy density of 420&#160;Wh&#160;L&#8722;1, which is remarkably higher than reported numbers. The unique binder design is greatly promising and offers a valuable material solution for LIBs with high&#8208;loading mass and flexible designs.

         <title>Monodispersed Sub&#8208;1&#160;nm Inorganic Cluster Chains in Polymers for Solid Electrolytes with Enhanced Li&#8208;Ion Transport</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 47, November 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy of fully active Li+ conductive networks in composite solid&#8208;state electrolytes is proposed by achieving monodispersion of sub&#8208;1 nm inorganic cluster chains in polymer matrix. 3D networks connected by monodispersed cluster chains eliminate the original defects of common inert fillers and build homogeneous, large&#8208;scale, continuous organic&#8211;inorganic interfaces.








Abstract
The organic&#8211;inorganic interfaces can enhance Li+ transport in composite solid&#8208;state electrolytes (CSEs) due to the strong interface interactions. However, Li+ non&#8208;conductive areas in CSEs with inert fillers will hinder the construction of efficient Li+ transport channels. Herein, CSEs with fully active Li+ conductive networks are proposed to improve Li+ transport by composing sub&#8208;1&#160;nm inorganic cluster chains and organic polymer chains. The inorganic cluster chains are monodispersed in polymer matrix by a brief mixed&#8208;solvent strategy, their sub&#8208;1&#160;nm diameter and ultrafine dispersion state eliminate Li+ non&#8208;conductive areas in the interior of inert fillers and filler&#8208;agglomeration, respectively, providing rich surface areas for interface interactions. Therefore, the 3D networks connected by the monodispersed cluster chains finally construct homogeneous, large&#8208;scale, continuous Li+ fast transport channels. Furthermore, a conjecture about 1D oriented distribution of organic polymer chains along the inorganic cluster chains is proposed to optimize Li+ pathways. Consequently, the as&#8208;obtained CSEs possess high ionic conductivity at room temperature (0.52&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1), high Li+ transference number (0.62), and more mobile Li+ (50.7%). The assembled LiFePO4/Li cell delivers excellent stability of 1000 cycles at 0.5&#160;C and 700 cycles at 1&#160;C.

&lt;p&gt;A new strategy of fully active Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductive networks in composite solid-state electrolytes is proposed by achieving monodispersion of sub-1 nm inorganic cluster chains in polymer matrix. 3D networks connected by monodispersed cluster chains eliminate the original defects of common inert fillers and build homogeneous, large-scale, continuous organic&#8211;inorganic interfaces.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The organic&#8211;inorganic interfaces can enhance Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport in composite solid-state electrolytes (CSEs) due to the strong interface interactions. However, Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; non-conductive areas in CSEs with inert fillers will hinder the construction of efficient Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport channels. Herein, CSEs with fully active Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductive networks are proposed to improve Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport by composing sub-1&#160;nm inorganic cluster chains and organic polymer chains. The inorganic cluster chains are monodispersed in polymer matrix by a brief mixed-solvent strategy, their sub-1&#160;nm diameter and ultrafine dispersion state eliminate Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; non-conductive areas in the interior of inert fillers and filler-agglomeration, respectively, providing rich surface areas for interface interactions. Therefore, the 3D networks connected by the monodispersed cluster chains finally construct homogeneous, large-scale, continuous Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; fast transport channels. Furthermore, a conjecture about 1D oriented distribution of organic polymer chains along the inorganic cluster chains is proposed to optimize Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; pathways. Consequently, the as-obtained CSEs possess high ionic conductivity at room temperature (0.52&#160;mS&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), high Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transference number (0.62), and more mobile Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (50.7%). The assembled LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/Li cell delivers excellent stability of 1000 cycles at 0.5&#160;C and 700 cycles at 1&#160;C. This research provides a new strategy for enhancing Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport by efficient interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>3D Imprinting of Voxel&#8208;Level Structural Colors in Lithium Niobate Crystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 47, November 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advanced coloration methods are of pivotal importance in science, technology, and engineering. In this work, a facile voxel&#8208;level programmable 3D structural coloration in bulk lithium niobate crystals is achieved. Micro&#8211;nanoscale colorful voxels can be fast inscribed into any spatial position of the matrix. The present principle is anticipated to boost the applications of structural coloration in 3D displays, encryption, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and data storage.








Abstract
Advanced coloration methods are of pivotal importance in science, technology, and engineering. However, 3D structural colors that are critical for emerging multidimensional information representation and recording are rarely achievable. Here, a facile voxel&#8208;level programmable 3D structural coloration in the bulk lithium niobate (LiNbO3) crystal is reported. This is achieved by engineering wavelength&#8208;selective interference between ordinary (O) and extraordinary (E) light in the crystal matrix. To induce effective phase contrast between O and E light for establishing the highly localized interference across the visible band, the presence of a pulse&#8208;internal&#8208;coupling effect is revealed in the single&#8208;pulse ultrafast laser&#8211;crystal interaction and an ultrafast&#8208;laser&#8208;induced micro&#8208;amorphization (MA) strategy is thus developed to manipulate local matrix structure. Consequently, micro&#8211;nanoscale colorful voxels can be fast inscribed into any spatial position of the crystal matrix in one step. It is demonstrated that the colors can be flexibly manipulated and quickly extracted in 3D space. Multidimensional MA&#8208;color data storage with large capacity, high writing and readout speed, long lifetime, and excellent stability under harsh conditions is achieved. The present principle enables multifunctional 3D structural coloration devices inside high&#8208;refractive&#8208;index transparent dielectrics and can serve as a general platform to innovate next&#8208;generation information optics.

         <title>Digital Manufacturing of Functional Ready&#8208;to&#8208;Use Microfluidic Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 47, November 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Digital manufacturing of functional microfluidic systems is introduced in the form of structurally encoded, self&#8208;powered capillaric circuits (CC), thanks to new hydrophilic inks. Monolithic CCs are 3D printed with design innovations including circular cross&#8208;sections, embedded stop valves, and gyroid capillary pumps. Programmable liquid handling via retention burst valves and microfluidic chain reactions are shown and applied to an immunoassay.








Abstract
Digital manufacturing (DM) holds great potential for microfluidics, but requirements for embedded conduits and high resolution beyond the capability of common manufacturing equipment, and microfluidic systems' dependence on peripheralshave limited its adoption. Capillaric circuits (CCs) are structurally encoded, self&#8208;contained microfluidic systems that operate and self&#8208;fill via precisely tailored hydrophilicity. CCs &#160;are&#160; heretofore hydrophilized in a plasma chamber, but which offers only transient hydrophilicity, lacks reproducibility, and limits CC design to open surface channels subsequently sealed with tape. Here, the additive DM of monolithic, fully functional, and intrinsically hydrophilic CCs is reported. CCs are 3D printed with commonly available light&#8208;engine&#8208;based 3D printers using poly(ethylene glycol)diacrylate&#8208;based ink co&#8208;polymerized with hydrophilic acrylic acid crosslinkers and optimized for hydrophilicity and printability. A new, robust capillary valve design and embedded conduits with circular cross&#8208;sections that prevent bubble trapping are presented, interwoven circuit architectures created, and CC use illustrated with an immunoassay. Finally, the external paper capillary pumps are eliminated by directly embedding the capillary pump in the chip as a porous gyroid structure, realizing fully functional, monolithic CCs. Thence, a digital file can be made into a CC by commonly available 3D printers in less than 30&#160;min enabling low&#8208;cost, distributed DM of fully functional ready&#8208;to&#8208;use microfluidic systems.

         <title>Hapten/Myristoyl Functionalized Poly(propyleneimine) Dendrimers as Potent Cell Surface Recruiters of Antibodies for Mediating Innate Immune Killing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 47, November 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents an innovative approach to enhance immune&#8208;mediated cancer cell killing. Poly(propyleneimine) dendrimers functionalized with cell membrane anchoring motifs and motifs recruiting endogenous anti&#8208;hapten antibodies exhibit exceptional antibody&#8208;recruiting capacity. In vitro experiments demonstrate efficient dendrimer&#8208;mediated binding of antibodies to cancer cells and phagocytosis by macrophages. Intratumoral injection in mice successfully induces recruitment of anti&#8208;hapten antibodies into solid tumors.








Abstract
Recruiting endogenous antibodies to the surface of cancer cells using antibody&#8208;recruiting molecules has the potential to unleash innate immune effector killing mechanisms against antibody&#8208;bound cancer cells. The affinity of endogenous antibodies is relatively low, and many currently explored antibody&#8208;recruiting strategies rely on targeting over&#8208;expressed receptors, which have not yet been identified in most solid tumors. Here, both challenges are addressed by functionalizing poly(propyleneimine) (PPI) dendrimers with both multiple dinitrophenyl (DNP) motifs, as anti&#8208;hapten antibody&#8208;recruiting motifs, and myristoyl motifs, as universal phospholipid cell membrane anchoring motifs, to recruit anti&#8208;hapten antibodies to cell surfaces. By exploiting the multivalency of the ligand exposure on the dendrimer scaffold, it is demonstrated that dendrimers featuring ten myristoyl and six DNP motifs exhibit the highest antibody&#8208;recruiting capacity in vitro. Furthermore, it is shown that treating cancer cells with these dendrimers in vitro marks them for phagocytosis by macrophages in the presence of anti&#8208;hapten antibodies. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, it is shown that intratumoral injection of these dendrimers in vivo in tumor&#8208;bearing mice results in the recruitment of anti&#8208;DNP antibodies to the cell surface in the tumor microenvironment. These findings highlight the potential of dendrimers as a promising class of novel antibody&#8208;recruiting molecules for use in cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Ultralow Roll&#8208;Off Quantum Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Using Engineered Carrier Injection Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 47, November 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs) can only achieve high external quantum efficiency (EQE) at relatively low current density due to the efficiency roll&#8208;off effect. Here, this article reports an ultralow roll&#8208;off QLED, the EQE maintained over 20.6% up to 1000 mA cm&#8722;2, dropping only by &#8776;5% from the peak EQE of 21.6%.








Abstract
Quantum dot (QD) light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs) have attracted extensive attention due to their high color purity, solution&#8208;processability, and high brightness. Due to extensive efforts, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of QLEDs has approached the theoretical limit. However, because of the efficiency roll&#8208;off, the high EQE can only be achieved at relatively low luminance, hindering their application in high&#8208;brightness devices such as near&#8208;to&#8208;eye displays and lighting applications. Here, this article reports an ultralow roll&#8208;off QLED that is achieved by simultaneously blocking electron leakage and enhancing the hole injection, thereby shifting the recombination zone back to the emitting QDs layer. These devices maintain EQE over 20.6% up to 1000 mA cm&#8722;2 current density, dropping only by &#8776;5% from the peak EQE of 21.6%, which is the highest value ever reported for the bottom&#8208;emitting red QLEDs. Furthermore, the maximum luminance of the optimal device reaches 320&#8201;000 cd m&#8722;2, 2.7 times higher than the control device (Lmax: 128&#8201;000 cd m&#8722;2). A passive matrix (PM) QLED display panel with high brightness based on the optimized device structure is also demonstrated. The proposed approach advances the potential of QLEDs to operate efficiently in high&#8208;brightness scenarios.

Due to extensive efforts, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of QLEDs has approached the theoretical limit. However, because of the efficiency roll-off, the high EQE can only be achieved at relatively low luminance, hindering their application in high-brightness devices such as near-to-eye displays and lighting applications. Here, this article reports an ultralow roll-off QLED that is achieved by simultaneously blocking electron leakage and enhancing the hole injection, thereby shifting the recombination zone back to the emitting QDs layer. These devices maintain EQE over 20.6% up to 1000 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; current density, dropping only by &#8776;5% from the peak EQE of 21.6%, which is the highest value ever reported for the bottom-emitting red QLEDs. Furthermore, the maximum luminance of the optimal device reaches 320&#8201;000 cd m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 2.7 times higher than the control device (&lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;: 128&#8201;000 cd m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). A passive matrix (PM) QLED display panel with high brightness based on the optimized device structure is also demonstrated. The proposed approach advances the potential of QLEDs to operate efficiently in high-brightness scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Wireless and Closed&#8208;Loop Smart Dressing for Exudate Management and On&#8208;Demand Treatment of Chronic Wounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 47, November 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional wearable patch is synthetically integrated to absorb exudates, monitor wound status, and personalize treatment. The designed multifunctional integrated intelligent wound dressing (IWD) is suitable for different wound sizes and provides a basic platform reference for chronic wound treatment.








Abstract
Chronic wounds have become a significant threat to people's physical and mental health and have increased the burden of social medical care. Intelligent wound dressing (IWD) with wound condition monitoring and closed&#8208;loop on&#8208;demand drug therapy can shorten the healing process and alleviate patient suffering. However, single&#8208;function wound dressings cannot meet the current needs of chronic wound treatment. Here, a wearable IWD consisting of wound exudate management, sensor monitoring, closed&#8208;loop therapy, and flexible circuit modules is reported, which can achieve effective synergy between wound exudate management and on&#8208;demand wound therapy. The dressing is attached to the wound site, and the wound exudate is spontaneously pumped into the microfluidic channel for storage. Meanwhile, the IWD can detect the state of the wound through the temperature and humidity sensor, and use this as feedback to control the liquid metal (LM) heater through a smartphone, thereby realizing the on&#8208;demand drug release from the hydrogel. In a mouse model of infected wounds, IWD accelerates wound healing by reducing inflammatory responses, promoting angiogenesis and collagen deposition.

         <title>High Entropy Nonlinear Dielectrics with Superior Thermally Stable Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 47, November 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work creates a high&#8208;entropy nonlinear dielectric system based on the expansion of lead magnesium niobate&#8211;lead titanate with the additive Ba, Hf, and Zr ions. The structural phase transformation is not detected up to 250 &#176;C, accompanied by excellent thermal stability at high temperatures on the structural and electrical characteristics. With these advantages, these materials hold vast potential applications.








Abstract
A high configurational entropy, achieved through a proper design of compositions, can minimize the Gibbs free energy and stabilize the quasi&#8208;equilibrium phases in a solid&#8208;solution form. This leads to the development of high&#8208;entropy materials with unique structural characteristics and excellent performance, which otherwise could&#160;not be achieved through conventional pathways. This work develops a high&#8208;entropy nonlinear dielectric system, based on the expansion of lead magnesium niobate&#8211;lead titanate. A dense and uniform distribution of nano&#8208;polar regions is&#160;observed in the samples owing to the addition of Ba, Hf, and Zr ions, which lead to enhanced performance of nonlinear dielectrics. The fact that no structural phase transformation is&#160;detected up to 250&#160;&#176;C, and no noticeable change or a steep drop in structural and electrical characteristics is&#160;observed at high temperatures suggests a robust thermal stability of the dielectric systems developed. With these advantages, these materials hold vast potential for applications such as dielectric energy storage, dielectric tunability, and electrocaloric effect. Thus, this work offers a new high&#8208;entropy configuration with elemental modulation, with enhanced dielectric material features.

         <title>Threshold Modulative Artificial GABAergic Nociceptor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 47, November 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A threshold&#8208;modulative artificial GABAergic nociceptor is proposed for the first time. The device includes two types of charge traps, demonstrating biological second&#8208;order nociceptive behaviors. Also, its temperature&#8208;dependent trapping characteristics can implement hot&#8208; and cold&#8208;sensitive thermoreceptors by controlling the trapping states, enabling it to detect the surrounding temperature conditions.








Abstract
Gamma&#8208;aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a crucial inhibitory neurotransmitter of the central nervous system. It modifies the signal threshold of the nociceptor, allowing it to react to external stimuli in various circumstances. Thus, GABAergic behaviors are critical characteristics of adaptive behavior in life. Here, a threshold&#8208;modulative artificial GABAergic nociceptor is reported for the first time at a Pt/Ti/Nb2O5&#8722;x/Al2O3&#8722;y/Pt/Ti (top to bottom) of the double charge trapping structure. The Al2O3&#8722;y layer contains deep defect states that function similarly to the GABA neurotransmitter in modulating the signal threshold. Meanwhile, the Nb2O5&#8722;x layer traps volatile charges and produces nociceptive behaviors. The combined dynamics of the two layers readily offer threshold&#8208;modulative GABAergic nociceptive behaviors. Based on these GABAergic behaviors, a method of implementing hot&#8208; and cold&#8208;sensitive thermoreceptors is demonstrated and shows its potential applications in advanced sensory devices.

         <title>Easy&#8208;To&#8208;Wear Auxetic SMA Knot&#8208;Architecture for Spatiotemporal and Multimodal Haptic Feedbacks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 47, November 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel auxetic&#8208;architectured wearable fabric actuator is developed by interlacing and knotting shape&#8208;memory alloy wires into auxetic structures. By incorporating meta&#8208;design, the auxetic&#8208;architectured fabric actuator shows unprecedented feature of size&#8208;fitting and self&#8208;fitting for superior wearability. Moreover, surface electrical property is adjusted to ensure zone&#8208;specified actuation, providing the wearer with spatiotemporally diverse multimodal tactile feedback






.

Abstract
Wearable haptic interfaces prioritize user comfort, but also value the ability to provide diverse feedback patterns for immersive interactions with the virtual or augmented reality. Here, to provide both comfort and diverse tactile feedback, an easy&#8208;to&#8208;wear and multimodal wearable haptic auxetic fabric (WHAF) is prepared by knotting shape&#8208;memory alloy wires into an auxetic&#8208;structured fabric. This unique meta&#8208;design allows the WHAF to completely expand and contract in 3D, providing superior size&#8208;fitting and shape&#8208;fitting capabilities. Additionally, a microscale thin layer of Parylene is coated on the surface to create electrically separated zones within the WHAF, featuring zone&#8208;specified actuation for conveying diverse spatiotemporal information to users with using the WHAF alone. Depending on the body part it is worn on, the WHAF conveys either cutaneous or kinesthetic feedback, thus, working as a multimodal wearable haptic interface. As a result, when worn on the forearm, the WHAF intuitively provides spatiotemporal information to users during hands&#8208;free navigation and teleoperation in virtual reality, and when worn on the elbow, the WHAF guides users to reach the desired elbow flexion, like a personal exercise advisor.

         <title>Non&#8208;Linear Optics at Twist Interfaces in h&#8208;BN/SiC Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 47, November 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) thin films have been grown on silicon carbide substrates exhibiting strong non&#8208;linear second&#8208;harmonic generation and ultra&#8208;low cross&#8208;plane thermal conductivity, attributed to the inherent formation of twisted nano&#8208;domain edges between the stacked h&#8208;BN nanocrystals with random in&#8208;plane orientations, as revealed by the first&#8208;principles time&#8208;dependent density functional theory.








Abstract
Understanding the emergent electronic structure in twisted atomically thin layers has led to the exciting field of twistronics. However, practical applications of such systems are challenging since the specific angular correlations between the layers must be precisely controlled and the layers have to be single crystalline with uniform atomic ordering. Here, an alternative, simple, and scalable approach is suggested, where nanocrystallinetwo&#8208;dimensional (2D) film on 3D substrates yields twisted&#8208;interface&#8208;dependent properties. Ultrawide&#8208;bandgap hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) thin films are directly grown on high in&#8208;plane lattice mismatched wide&#8208;bandgap silicon carbide (4H&#8208;SiC) substrates to explore the twist&#8208;dependent structure&#8208;property correlations. Concurrently, nanocrystalline h&#8208;BN thin film shows strong non&#8208;linear second&#8208;harmonic generation and ultra&#8208;low cross&#8208;plane thermal conductivity at room temperature, which are attributed to the twisted domain edges between van der Waals stacked nanocrystals with random in&#8208;plane orientations. First&#8208;principles calculations based on time&#8208;dependent density functional theory manifest strong even&#8208;order optical nonlinearity in twisted h&#8208;BN layers. This work unveils that directly deposited 2D nanocrystalline thin film on 3D substrates could provide easily accessible twist&#8208;interfaces, therefore enabling a simple and scalable approach to utilize the 2D&#8208;twistronics integrated in 3D material devices for next&#8208;generation nanotechnology.

         <title>Mechano&#8208;Activated Cell Therapy for Accelerated Diabetic Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 47, November 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; platform combining magneto&#8208;responsive hydrogel, cells, and wireless magneto&#8208;induced dynamic mechanical stimulation is developed for diabetic wound healing. It encapsulates fibroblasts and keratinocytes for superior wound closure, with enhanced cell proliferation, extracellular microenvironment production, and neo&#8208;vascularization, suggesting potential applicability to diabetic ulcer. Plus, leveraging scRNAseq data, a mechanosensitive fibroblast subpopulation is identified for further therapeutic impact.








Abstract
Chronic diabetic wounds are a significant global healthcare challenge. Current strategies, such as biomaterials, cell therapies, and medical devices, however, only target a few pathological features and have limited efficacy. A powerful platform technology combining magneto&#8208;responsive hydrogel, cells, and wireless magneto&#8208;induced dynamic mechanical stimulation (MDMS) is developed to accelerate diabetic wound healing. The hydrogel encapsulates U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)&#8208;approved fibroblasts and keratinocytes to achieve &#8764;3&#8208;fold better wound closure in a diabetic mouse model. MDMS acts as a nongenetic mechano&#8208;rheostat to activate fibroblasts, resulting in &#8764;240% better proliferation, &#8764;220% more collagen deposition, and improved keratinocyte paracrine profiles via the Ras/MEK/ERK pathway to boost angiogenesis. The magneto&#8208;responsive property also enables on&#8208;demand insulin release for spatiotemporal glucose regulation through increasing network deformation and interstitial flow. By mining scRNAseq data, a mechanosensitive fibroblast subpopulation is identified that can be mechanically tuned for enhanced proliferation and collagen production, maximizing therapeutic impact. The &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; system addresses major pathological factors associated with diabetic wounds in a single platform, with potential applications for other challenging wound types.

         <title>A Functional Janus Ag Nanowires/Bacterial Cellulose Separator for High&#8208;Performance Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc Anode Under Harsh Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 47, November 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrathin Janus separator composed of Ag nanowires and bacterial cellulose is designed for dendrite&#8208;free zinc&#8208;metal batteries. This Janus separator with abundant zincophilic sites, uniform&#8208;distributed electric/thermal field, and enhanced ion transport kinetics can help to realize the stable cycle life over 1000 h under 80 mA cm&#8722;2 and sustain over 600 h at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 under 50 &#176;C.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) offer promising prospects for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to their inherent abundance and safety features. However, the growth of zinc dendrites remains a primary obstacle to the practical industrialization of AZIBs, especially under harsh conditions of high current densities and elevated temperatures. To address this issue, a Janus separator with an exceptionally ultrathin thickness of 29&#160;&#181;m is developed. This Janus separator features the bacterial cellulose (BC) layer on one side and Ag nanowires/bacterial cellulose (AgNWs/BC) layer on the other side. High zincophilic property and excellent electric/thermal conductivity of AgNWs make them ideal for serving as an ion pump to accelerate Zn2+ transport in the electrolyte, resulting in greatly improved Zn2+ conductivity, deposition of homogeneous Zn nuclei, and dendrite&#8208;free Zn. Consequently, the Zn||Zn symmetrical cells with the Janus separator exhibit a stable cycle life of over 1000 h under 80&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and are sustained for over 600 h at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 under 50 &#176;C. Further, the Janus separator enables excellent cycling stability in AZIBs, aqueous zinc&#8208;ion capacitors (AZICs), and scaled&#8208;up flexible soft&#8208;packaged batteries. This study demonstrates the potential of functional separators in promoting the application of aqueous zinc batteries, particularly under harsh conditions.

         <title>High Freshwater Flux Solar Desalination via a 3D Plasmonic Evaporator with an Efficient Heat&#8208;Mass Evaporation Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 47, November 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficient heat&#8208;mass evaporation interface (HM&#8208;EI) allows the 3D plasmonic evaporator to achieve a freshwater flux of 29.1 L&#160;m&#8208;2&#160;h&#8208;1, which is superior to the traditional solar evaporator design and approaches the level of reverse osmosis. This study marks a significant step toward industrial solar&#8208;driven desalination technology and provides a potential zero carbon emissions solution to the drinking water crisis.








Abstract
Passive solar desalination with interfacial heating is a promising technique to utilize solar energy to convert seawater into fresh water through evaporation and condensation. However, the current freshwater flux of solar desalination is much below industrial requirements (&gt; 20 L&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1). Herein, it is demonstrated that a 3D plasmonic evaporator with an efficient heat&#8208;mass evaporation interface (HM&#8208;EI) achieves a freshwater flux of 29.1 L&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1 for 3.5 wt.% NaCl, which surpasses the previous solar evaporators and approaches the level of reverse osmosis (the highest installed capacity in industrial seawater desalination technology). The realization of high freshwater flux solar desalination comes from the efficient HM&#8208;EI comprising a grid&#8208;like plasmonic macrostructure for enhanced energy utilization in heat properties and a large&#8208;pore microstructure for accelerated ion transport in mass properties. This work provides a new direction for designing next&#8208;generation solar evaporators with high freshwater flux for industrial requirements.

         <title>Large&#8208;Scale Preparation for Multicolor Stimulus&#8208;Responsive Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Paper via Cellulose Heterogeneous Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 47, November 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile heterogeneous B&#9472;O covalent bonding strategy is developed to anchor arylboronic acid chromophores onto cellulose chains, using pure water as the solvent. A papermaking production line is built to convert paper pulp reacted with arylboronic acid additives to multicolor room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) paper on a large scale.








Abstract
The large&#8208;scale preparation of sustainable room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials, particularly those with stimulus&#8208;response properties, is attractive but remains challenging. This study develops a facile heterogeneous B&#9472;O covalent bonding strategy to anchor arylboronic acid chromophores to cellulose chains using pure water as a solvent, resulting in multicolor RTP cellulose. The rigid environment provided by the B&#9472;O covalent bonds and hydrogen bonds promotes the triplet population and suppresses quenching, leading to an excellent lifetime of 1.42 s for the target RTP cellulose. By increasing the degree of chromophore conjugation, the afterglow colors can be tuned from blue to green and then to red. Motivated by this finding, a papermaking production line is built to convert paper pulp reacted with an arylboronic acid additive into multicolor RTP paper on a large scale. Furthermore, the RTP paper is sensitive to water because of the destruction of hydrogen bonds, and the stimuli&#8208;response can be repeated in response to water/heat stimuli. The RTP paper can be folded into 3D afterglow origami handicrafts and anti&#8208;counterfeiting packing boxes or used for stimulus&#8208;responsive information encryption. This success paves the way for the development of large&#8208;scale, eco&#8208;friendly, and practical stimuli&#8208;responsive RTP materials.

         <title>Polymer Mechanochemistry in Microbubbles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 47, November 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accelerating ultrasound&#8208;induced mechanochemical bond scission is realized by wrapping micron&#8208;sized gas bubbles in a mechanoresponsive polymer shell. Disulfide mechanophore is able to be activated using a shorter time in this system than common mechanochemical approach. This strategy promises a new pathway to implement polymer mechanochemistry, which might be beneficial for developments in the field of sonopharmacology.








Abstract
Polymer mechanochemistry is a promising technology to convert mechanical energy into chemical functionality by breaking covalent and supramolecular bonds site&#8208;selectively. Yet, the mechanochemical reaction rates of covalent bonds in typically used ultrasonication setups lead to reasonable conversions only after comparably long sonication times. This can be accelerated by either increasing the reactivity of the mechanoresponsive moiety or by modifying the encompassing polymer topology. Here, a microbubble system with a tailored polymer shell consisting of an N2 gas core and a mechanoresponsive disulfide&#8208;containing polymer network is presented. It is found that the mechanochemical activation of the disulfides is greatly accelerated using these microbubbles compared to commensurate solid core particles or capsules filled with liquid. Aided by computational simulations, it is found that low shell thickness, low shell stiffness and crosslink density, and a size&#8208;dependent eigenfrequency close to the used ultrasound frequency maximize the mechanochemical yield over the course of the sonication process.

         <title>Solution&#8208;Processed Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework Nanofilms for High&#8208;Performance Resistive Memory Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 47, November 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;quality hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) nanofilms with smooth surface, good crystallinity, and high orientation are successfully fabricated and employed in resistive memory devices. The resulting memristors demonstrate excellent switching behavior. More strikingly, the scratched HOF film can be readily regenerated through a simple solvent rinsing process, enabling their reuse for the fabrication of new memristors.








Abstract
The integration of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) into electronic devices holds great promise due to their high crystallinity, intrinsic porosity, and easy regeneration. However, despite their potential, the utilization of HOFs in electronic&#160;devices remains largely unexplored, primarily due to the challenges associated with fabricating high&#8208;quality films. Herein, a controlled synthesis of HOF&#160;nanofilms with smooth surface, good crystallinity, and high orientation is achieved using a solution&#8208;processed approach. The memristors exhibit outstanding bipolar switching performance with a&#160;low set voltage of 0.86&#160;V, excellent retention of 1.64 &#215; 104 s, and operational endurance of 60 cycles. Additionally, these robust memristors display remarkable thermal stability, maintaining their performance even at elevated temperatures of up to 200 &#176;C. More strikingly, scratched HOF&#160;films can be readily regenerated through a simple solvent rinsing process, enabling their reuse for the fabrication of new memristors, which is difficult to achieve with traditional resistive switching materials. Additionally, a switching mechanism based on the reversible formation and annihilation of conductive filaments is revealed. This work provides novel and invaluable insights that have a significant impact on advancing the widespread adoption of HOFs as active layers in electronic devices.

         <title>Self&#8208;Adaptive Nanoregulator to Mitigate Dynamic Immune Evasion of Pancreatic Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 47, November 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A peptide&#8208;drug conjugate (PDC)&#8208;based self&#8208;adaptive nanoregulator with first&#8208;stage spherical micelle to nanofiber, and second&#8208;stage nanofiber to spherical nanoparticles morphology transformation performance, is developed for tailoring dynamic immune evasion of PDAC. The nanoregulator is demonstrated to intervene in cancer&#8208;associated fibroblast&#8208;mediated tumor fibrosis and reverse 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase 1&#8208;kynurenine axis&#8208;involed&#160;T&#8208;cell exhaustion.








Abstract
The advance of immunotherapy has shifted the paradigm of cancer management in clinics. Nevertheless, a considerable subset of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients marginally respond to current immunotherapy due to the occurrence of dynamic immune evasion arising from intrinsic and therapeutic stress. In this investigation, the pivotal role of pancreatic cancer&#8208;associated fibroblast (CAF)&#8208;induced fibrosis and tumor cell&#8208;mediated T&#8208;cell exhaustion in driving the dynamic immune evasion is identified. Building upon this discovery, the authors herein engineer a novel peptide&#8208;drug conjugate (PDC)&#8208;based self&#8208;adaptive nanoregulator for mitigating dynamic immune evasion of PDAC. The resulting nanoregulator can perform a two&#8208;stage morphology transformation from spherical micelle to nanofiber, and subsequently from nanofiber to spherical nanoparticles. Such kind of nanostructure design can facilitate differentialized delivery of CAF inhibitor in the extracellular matrix for intervening CAF&#8208;mediated tumor fibrosis, and indoleamine 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase 1 inhibitor to tumor cells for relieving IDO1&#8208;kynurenine axis&#8208;induced T&#8208;cell exhaustion. Antitumor study with the self&#8208;adaptive nanoregulator elicited persistent antitumor immunity and remarkable antitumor performance in both Panc02 and KPC tumor models in vivo. Taken together, the PDC&#8208;based self&#8208;adaptive nanoregulator may provide a novel avenue for enhanced PDAC immunotherapy.

         <title>Skyrmion&#8208;Bubble Bundles in an X&#8208;Type Sr2Co2Fe28O46 Hexaferrite above Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 47, November 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study showcases the successful formation of skyrmion&#8208;bubble bundles, which are comprised of multiple skyrmions and/or bubbles enclosed within a closed stripe domain. These bundles exhibit unique characteristics, including stability at room temperature, flexibility in the arrangement of internal skyrmions and bubbles, and field&#8208;controlled topological magnetic transformations, and promote the advancement of multi&#8208;Q topological spintronic devices.








Abstract
Magnetic skyrmions are spin swirls that possess topological nontriviality and are considered particle&#8208;like entities. They are distinguished by an integer topological charge Q. The presence of skyrmion bundles provides an opportunity to explore the range of values for Q, which is crucial for the advancement of topological spintronic devices with multi&#8208;Q properties. In this study, a new material candidate, Sr2Co2Fe28O46 hexaferrite of the X&#8208;type, which hosts small dipolar skyrmions at room temperature and above is presented. By exploiting reversed magnetic fields from metastable skyrmion bubbles at zero fields,&#160;skyrmion&#8208;bubble bundles with different interior skyrmion/bubble numbers, topological charges, and morphologies at room temperature are incorporated. These experimental findings are consistently supported by micromagnetic simulations. These results highlight the versatility of topological spin textures in centrosymmetric uniaxial magnets, thereby paving the way for the development of room&#8208;temperature topological spintronic devices with multi&#8208;Q characteristics.

In this study, a new material candidate, Sr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;28&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;46&lt;/sub&gt; hexaferrite of the X-type, which hosts small dipolar skyrmions at room temperature and above is presented. By exploiting reversed magnetic fields from metastable skyrmion bubbles at zero fields,&#160;skyrmion-bubble bundles with different interior skyrmion/bubble numbers, topological charges, and morphologies at room temperature are incorporated. These experimental findings are consistently supported by micromagnetic simulations. These results highlight the versatility of topological spin textures in centrosymmetric uniaxial magnets, thereby paving the way for the development of room-temperature topological spintronic devices with multi-&lt;i&gt;Q&lt;/i&gt; characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lanthanide 3D Supramolecular Framework Boosts Stable Perovskite Solar Cells with High UV Utilization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 47, November 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The antenna effect&#8208;mediated lanthanide&#8211;organic frameworks Tb&#8208;cpon greatly broaden the full&#8208;spectrum utilization and UV light sensitivity of the perovskite solar cells (PSCs) through the F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer process and energy downconversion effect. Structurally transformed 3D supramolecular skeletons as growth templates in perovskite crystallization maintain high efficiency and UV stability of PSCs under operating conditions by eliminating grain&#8208;boundary defects.








Abstract
In this work, the ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transition and F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer process is exploited to derive lanthanide&#8211;organic framework (Tb&#8208;cpon) modified perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with enhanced performance under UV irradiation. Tb&#8208;cpon&#8208;modified PSCs exhibit rapid response and reduced degradation due to energy downconversion facilitated by effective coupling of UV&#8208;sensitive chromophores to lanthanide luminescent centers, enhancing the spectral response range of the composite films. Furthermore, the characteristic changes of precursor particle sizes suggest formation of Tb&#8208;cpon adducts as intermediate products, leading to enhanced crystallinity and reduced defect concentrations in the Tb&#8208;cpon&#8208;perovskite hybrid film. Accordingly, the Tb&#8208;cpon&#8208;modified PSC devices obtain a champion efficiency up to 23.72% as well as a sensitive photovoltaic conversion even under pure UV irradiation. Moreover, the unencapsulated devices maintain more than 80% of the initial efficiency after continuous irradiation under a 310&#160;nm UV lamp for 24&#160;h (from the Au electrode side), compared to 21% for the control devices.

         <title>Azacyclic Anchor&#8208;Enabled Cohesive Graphite Electrodes for Sustainable Anion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 47, November 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating azacyclic anchors, the newly developed binder enhances the integrity and stability of graphite cathodes in dual&#8208;ion batteries. This innovative binder enables deep and reversible anion intercalation, thus achieving sustainable, high&#8208;capacity energy storage, and longer&#8208;lasting performance. Marking a significant leap in sustainable energy storage, its design promises fast charging and prolonged operation of rechargeable batteries.








Abstract
Advanced energy&#8208;storage devices are indispensable for expanding electric mobility applications. While anion intercalation&#8208;type redox chemistry in graphite cathodes has opened the path to high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries, surpassing the limited energy density of conventional lithium&#8208;ion batteries , a significant challenge remains: the large volume expansion of graphite upon anion intercalation. In this study,&#160;a novel polymeric binder and cohesive graphite cathode design for dual&#8208;ion batteries (DIBs) is presented, which exhibits remarkable stability even under high voltage conditions (&gt;5&#160;V). The innovative binder incorporates an acrylate moiety ensuring superior oxidative stability and self&#8208;healing features, along with an azide moiety, which allows for azacyclic covalent bonding with graphite and interchain crosslinking. A simple 1&#8208;h ultraviolet treatment is sufficient for binder fixation within the electrode, leading to the covalent bond formation with graphite and the creation of a robust three&#8208;dimensional network. This modification facilitates deeper and more reversible anion intercalation, leading to improved capacity, extended lifespan, and sustainable anion storage.&#160;The&#160;binder design, exhibiting exceptional adhesive properties and effective stress mitigation, enables the construction of ultrathick graphite cathodes. These findings provide valuable insights for the development of advanced binders, paving the way for high&#8208;performance DIBs.

         <title>Inducing Motions of Polymers in Liquid Nitrogen with Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 47, November 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymer films with bridged azobenzene moieties in crosslink chains exhibit macroscopic deformation upon irradiation with light even in liquid nitrogen, where thermal molecular motions are severely restricted. Motions of polymers are activated under cryogenic conditions only by light energy, implying that thermal energy is not necessarily required for the motions of soft materials.








Abstract
Polymer materials that show macroscopic deformation in response to external stimuli are feasible for novel soft actuators including microactuators. Incorporation of photochromic moieties, such as azobenzenes, into polymer networks enables macroscopic deformation under irradiation with light through photoisomerization. Under cryogenic conditions, however, it has been difficult to induce macroscopic deformation as polymers lose their soft nature due to the severe restrictions of molecular motions. Here, activation of molecular motions and macroscopic deformation in liquid nitrogen only with light for polymers containing photochromic moieties is reported. Photoinduced bending of polymer networks with normal azobenzenes in liquid nitrogen is enabled by preliminary UV irradiation at room temperature to produce cis&#8208;isomers. To realize photoinduced deformation directly in liquid nitrogen, polymer networks are functionalized with bridged azobenzenes, which exist as cis&#8208;isomers in thermodynamic equilibrium. The films with bridged azobenzenes exhibit reversible photoisomerization and bending upon irradiation with light in liquid nitrogen without the need of preliminary irradiation, implying that the change in conformation of polymer chains can be isothermally induced even under cryogenic conditions. Achievement of flexible motions under cryogenic conditions through isothermal processes will greatly expand the operating temperature range of soft actuators.

         <title>Recyclable and Robust Optical Nanoprobes with Engineered Enzymes for Sustainable Serodiagnostics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 47, November 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recyclable and robust fluorescent probes are constructed based on lanthanide&#8208;doped nanocomposites and thermostable engineered enzymes. The probes can be easily reused more than ten times and stored in a warm environment (37&#160;&#176;C for 10 days). This saves resources, reduces costs, and lowers storage requirements to realize sustainable diagnostics that meet the World Health Organization criteria for ideal tests.








Abstract
Recyclable fluorescence assays that can be stored at room temperature would greatly benefit biomedical diagnostics by bringing sustainability and cost&#8208;efficiency, especially for point&#8208;of&#8208;care serodiagnostics in developing regions. Here, a general strategy is proposed to generate recyclable fluorescent probes by using engineered enzymes with enhanced thermo&#8208;/chemo&#8208;stability, which maintains an outstanding serodiagnostic performance (accuracy &gt;95%) after 10 times of recycling as well as after storage at elevated temperatures (37 &#176;C for 10 days). With these three outstanding properties, recyclable fluorescent probes can be designed to detect various biomarkers of clinical importance by using different enzymes.

         <title>A Multiscale, Dynamic Elucidation of Li Solubility in the Alloy and Metallic Plating Process</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 47, November 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The underlying rationales that govern the rate&#8208;determining Li+ mass&#8208;transfer kinetics are comprehensively investigated across multiple scales, from the bulk solution, the faradic reaction at the interface to the solid&#8208;state diffusion. This study provides insights of thermodynamically in sequence, yet kinetics competitive processes, which facilitates innovation of the high&#8208;capacity alloy/metallic anodes.









Abstract
Li&#8208;containing alloys and metallic deposits offer substantial Li+ storage capacities as alternative anodes to commercial graphite. However, the thermodynamically in sequence, yet kinetically competitive mechanism between Li solubility in the solid solution and intermediate alloy&#8208;induced Li deposition remains debated, particularly across the multiple scales. The elucidation of the mechanism is rather challenging due to the dynamic alloy evolution upon the non&#8208;equilibrium, transient lithiation processes under coupled physical fields. Here, influential factors governing Li solubility in the Li&#8208;Zn alloy are comprehensively investigated as a demonstrative model, spanning from the bulk electrolyte solution to the ion diffusion within the electrode. Through real&#8208;time phase tracking and spatial distribution analysis of intermediate alloy/Li metallic species at varied temperatures, current densities and particle sizes, the driving force of Li solubility and metallic plating along the Li migration pathway are probed in&#8208;depth. This study investigates the correlation between kinetics (pronounced concentration polarization, miscibility gap in lattice grains) and rate&#8208;limiting interfacial charge transfer thermodynamics in dedicating the Li diffusion into the solid solution. Additionally, the lithiophilic alloy sites with the balanced diffusion barrier and Li adsorption energy are explored to favor the homogeneous metal plating, which provides new insights for the rational innovation of high&#8208;capacity alloy/metallic anodes.

     alt="A Multiscale, Dynamic Elucidation of Li Solubility in the Alloy and Metallic Plating Process"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The underlying rationales that govern the rate-determining Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; mass-transfer kinetics are comprehensively investigated across multiple scales, from the bulk solution, the faradic reaction at the interface to the solid-state diffusion. This study provides insights of thermodynamically in sequence, yet kinetics competitive processes, which facilitates innovation of the high-capacity alloy/metallic anodes.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Li-containing alloys and metallic deposits offer substantial Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; storage capacities as alternative anodes to commercial graphite. However, the thermodynamically in sequence, yet kinetically competitive mechanism between Li solubility in the solid solution and intermediate alloy-induced Li deposition remains debated, particularly across the multiple scales. The elucidation of the mechanism is rather challenging due to the dynamic alloy evolution upon the non-equilibrium, transient lithiation processes under coupled physical fields. Here, influential factors governing Li solubility in the Li-Zn alloy are comprehensively investigated as a demonstrative model, spanning from the bulk electrolyte solution to the ion diffusion within the electrode. Through real-time phase tracking and spatial distribution analysis of intermediate alloy/Li metallic species at varied temperatures, current densities and particle sizes, the driving force of Li solubility and metallic plating along the Li migration pathway are probed in-depth. This study investigates the correlation between kinetics (pronounced concentration polarization, miscibility gap in lattice grains) and rate-limiting interfacial charge transfer thermodynamics in dedicating the Li diffusion into the solid solution. Additionally, the lithiophilic alloy sites with the balanced diffusion barrier and Li adsorption energy are explored to favor the homogeneous metal plating, which provides new insights for the rational innovation of high-capacity alloy/metallic anodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Magnetic Imaging and Domain Nucleation in CrSBr Down to the 2D Limit</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 47, November 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using direct magnetic imaging of CrSBr, a van der Waals material 2D antiferromagnet, it is demonstrated that the magnetic anisotropy and moment density are nearly preserved down to the monolayer. These images reveal the formation of N&#233;el magnetic domain walls down to the monolayer. This material shows remarkable stability even for monolayer exposed to air.








Abstract
Recent advancements in 2D materials have revealed the potential of van der Waals magnets, and specifically of their magnetic anisotropy that allows applications down to the 2D limit. Among these materials, CrSBr has emerged as a promising candidate, because its intriguing magnetic and electronic properties have appeal for both fundamental and applied research in spintronics or magnonics. In this work, nano&#8208;SQUID&#8208;on&#8208;tip (SOT) microscopy is used to obtain direct magnetic imaging of CrSBr flakes with thicknesses ranging from monolayer (N = 1) to few&#8208;layer (N = 5). The ferromagnetic order is preserved down to the monolayer, while the antiferromagnetic coupling of the layers starts from the bilayer case. For odd layers, at zero applied magnetic field, the stray field resulting from the&#160;uncompensated layer is directly imaged. The progressive spin reorientation along the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction (hard axis) is also measured with a finite applied magnetic field, allowing evaluation of the anisotropy constant, which remains stable down to the monolayer and is close to the bulk value. Finally, by selecting the applied magnetic field protocol, the formation of N&#233;el magnetic domain walls is observed down to the single&#8208;layer limit.

         <title>Stochastic Electrical Detection of Single Ion&#8208;Gated Semiconducting Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 47, November 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrical measurements of individual semiconducting polymer chains in solution as they freely diffuse between nanogap electrodes are presented. Combined with mixed ionic&#8211;electronic charge transport, these experiments reveal changes in internal molecular configuration manifested as abrupt conductance fluctuations. This behavior is consistent with theoretical simulations based on the worm&#8208;like chain model for flexible polymers.








Abstract
Semiconducting polymer chains constitute the building blocks for a wide range of electronic materials and devices. However, most of their electrical characteristics at the single&#8208;molecule level have received little attention. Elucidating these properties can help understanding performance limits and enable new applications. Here, coupled ionic&#8211;electronic charge transport is exploited to measure the quasi&#8208;1D electrical current through long single conjugated polymer chains as they form transient contacts with electrodes separated by &#8776;10&#160;nm. Fluctuations between internal conformations of the individual polymers are resolved as abrupt, multilevel switches in the electrical current. This behavior is consistent with the theoretical simulations based on the worm&#8208;like&#8208;chain (WLC) model for semiflexible polymers. In addition to probing the intrinsic properties of single semiconducting polymer chains, the results provide an unprecedented window into the dynamics of random&#8208;coil polymers and enable the use of semiconducting polymers as electrical labels for single&#8208;molecule (bio)sensing assays.

         <title>An Activatable Prodrug Nanosystem for Ultrasound&#8208;Driven Multimodal Tumor Therapy and Metastasis Inhibition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 47, November 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dihydroethidium (DHE)&#8208;based prodrug nanosystem (DHE@PEG&#8208;SS&#8208;DSPE) is introduced for ultrasound&#8208;driven tumor therapy. Under medical ultrasound, it produces cytotoxic ethidium and reactive oxygen species. DHE@PEG&#8208;SS&#8208;DSPE induces ferroptosis via glutathione depletion, lipid peroxide accumulation, and glutathione peroxidase 4 reduction. Furthermore, DHE@PEG&#8208;SS&#8208;DSPE NPs not only exhibits effective ultrasound&#8208;active therapy of solid tumors but also downregulate the expression of metastasis&#8208;related proteins, inhibiting lung metastasis.








Abstract
Ultrasound, featuring deep tissue penetration and noninvasiveness, offers a new opportunity to activate functional materials in a tumor&#8208;selective manner. However, very few direct ultrasound&#8208;responsive redox systems are applicable under therapeutic ultrasound (1&#160;MHz). Herein, the investigations on nanoprodrug of DHE@PEG&#8208;SS&#8208;DSPE are reported, which exhibit glutathione&#8208;activated release of dihydroethidium (DHE) in tumor cells. DHE is stable with good biosafety and is transformed into cytotoxic ethidium to induce DNA damage under medical ultrasound irradiation, accompanied by the generation of reactive oxygen species. Further, DHE@PEG&#8208;SS&#8208;DSPE could effectively induce ferroptosis through glutathione depletion, lipid peroxide accumulation, and downregulation of glutathione peroxidase 4. In vivo studies confirmed that DHE@PEG&#8208;SS&#8208;DSPE nanoparticles effectively inhibit both the growth of solid tumors and the expression of metastasis&#8208;related proteins in mice, thus effectively inhibiting lung metastasis. This DHE&#8208;based prodrug nanosystem could lay a foundation for the design of ultrasound&#8208;driven therapeutic agents.

         <title>Promoting the Recruitment, Engagement, and Reinvigoration of Effector T Cells via an Injectable Hydrogel with a Supramolecular Binding Capability for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>

A &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;decorated alginate hydrogel system with T cell recruitment, engagement, and reinvigoration capabilities is developed to enhance T cell&#8208;mediated immunotherapy. 1) The adamantane&#8208;decorated anti&#8208;PD1 antibodies (Ad&#8208;aPD1) hitchhike on T cells. 2) Recruitment of T cells. 3) Supramolecular immobilization of antibodies. 4) Improved engagement between T cells and tumor cells. 5) Reinvigorated T cells in tumor tissue.









Abstract
T cells play a basic and key role in immunotherapy against solid tumors, and efficiently recruiting them into neoplastic foci and sustaining long&#8208;term effector function are consistent goals that remain a critical challenge. Here, an injectable alginate&#8208;based hydrogel with abundant &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (ALG&#8208;&#946;CD) sites is developed and intratumorally injected to recruit CCR9+CD8+ T cells (a subset of T cells with robust antitumor activity) via the trapped chemokine CCL25. In the meantime, an intravenously injected adamantane&#8208;decorated anti&#8208;PD1 antibody (Ad&#8208;aPD1) would hitchhike on recruited CCR9+CD8+ T cells to achieve the improved intratumoral accumulation of Ad&#8208;aPD1. Moreover, the Ad&#8208;PD1 and Ad&#8208;PDL1 antibodies are immobilized in the ALG&#8208;&#946;CD hydrogel through supramolecular host&#8211;guest interactions of Ad and &#946;CD, which facilitate engagement between CD8+ T cells and tumor cells and reinvigorate CD8+ T cells to avoid exhaustion. Based on this treatment strategy, T cell&#8208;mediated anticancer activity is promoted at multiple levels, eventually achieving superior antitumor efficacy in both orthotopic and postsurgical B16&#8208;F10 tumor models.

         <title>A Hyperspectral Camouflage Colorant Inspired by Natural Leaves</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 47, November 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by leaf chromogenesis, a microcapsule colorant with chloroplast&#8208;like structure and chlorophyll&#8208;like absorption is developed to generate similar reflectance to leaves. By controlling the spectral splitting of encapsulated phthalocyanine, the reflectance is precisely tailored to simulate the spectral variation among different natural leaves. This spectral performance validates the unprecedented camouflage potential for deceiving hyperspectral classification algorithm in foliar background.








Abstract
The unmet spectral mimicry of foliar green in camouflage materials is hampered by the lack of colorants with similar spectral properties to chlorophyll, resulting in substantial risks of exposure from hyperspectral target detection. By drawing inspiration from leaf chromogenesis, a microcapsule colorant with a chloroplast&#8208;like structure and chlorophyll&#8208;like absorption is developed, and a generic bilayer coating is designed to provide high spectral similarity to leaves with different growth stages, seasons, and species. Specifically, the microcapsule colorant preserves the monomeric absorption of the internal phthalocyanine and features the manufacturability of conventional pigments, such as amenability to painting and patterning, and compatibility to different substrates. The pigmented artificial leaves successfully deceive the hyperspectral classification algorithm in a foliar background, and outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;art spectral simulation materials. This coloration strategy expands the knowledge base of the spectral fine tuning of composite colorants, which are essential for their application in spectral&#8208;resolved optical materials.

         <title>Hybrid Crosslinked Solid Polymer Electrolyte via In&#8208;Situ Solidification Enables High&#8208;Performance Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 47, November 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel design of a hybrid crosslinked solid polymer electrolyte (HCPE), which is prepared by in situ solidification at room temperature, is reported. Lithium metal cells with this HCPE have the advantages of high ionic conductivity (2.22 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 at 30 &#176;C), high electrochemical window (5.2&#160;V), high lithium&#8208;ion transference number (0.88), and long lifetime (&gt;600 cycles) at room temperature (25&#160;&#176;C).








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries constructed by in&#8208;situ solidification of cyclic ether are considered to be a critical strategy for the next generation of solid&#8208;state batteries with high energy density and safety. However, the poor thermal/electrochemical stability of linear polyethers and severe interfacial reactions limit its further development. Herein, in&#8208;situ ring&#8208;opening hybrid crosslinked polymerization is proposed for organic/inorganic hybrid polymer electrolyte (HCPE) with superior ionic conductivity of 2.22 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 at 30&#160;&#176;C, ultrahigh Li+ transference number of 0.88, and wide electrochemical stability window of 5.2&#160;V. These allow highly stable lithium stripping/plating cycling for over 1000&#160;h at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, which also reveal a well&#8208;defined interfacial stabilization mechanism. Thus, HCPE endows assembled solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries with excellent long&#8208;cycle performance over 600 cycles at 2 C (25&#160;&#176;C) and superior capacity retention of 92.1%. More importantly, the&#160;proposed noncombustible HCPE opens up a new frontier to promote the practical application of high safety and high energy density solid&#8208;state batteries via in&#8208;situ solidification.

         <title>Advanced Multilayered Electrode with Planar Building Blocks Structure for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 47, November 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphdiyne (GDY) and black phosphorus (BP) are assembled in parallel to form building blocks (GDY/BP/GDY). The GDY/BP/GDY building blocks contribute to the superior migration kinetics of lithium&#8208;ion and desirable pseudocapacitive behaviors. The GDY/BP/GDY&#8208;based electrode with multilevel layered architecture constructed by such building blocks stacking exhibits excellent high&#8208;rate performance and cycling stability.








Abstract
To achieve the high&#8208;performance of lithium&#8208;ion battery, the optimization of electrode materials has generally been considered as the one of the important methods. But most of those works pay attention to the new materials preparation or interface modification rather than the structural innovation. Here, an advanced electrode (GDY/BP/GDY&#8208;E) with multilevel layered architecture constructed by planar building blocks stacking structure has been designed and fabricated to explore the structure design of the electrode. This new structure is assembled by graphdiyne (GDY) and black phosphorus (BP) in parallel to form a building block (GDY/BP/GDY). The electric fields between the two GDY sides of the planar building block structure contribute to the superior migration dynamics of lithium ions and desirable pseudocapacitance behavior. Meanwhile, the planar stacking structure of GDY/BP/GDY can efficiently inhibit volume expansion of BP and a series of parasitic reactions of electrolytes during the long&#8208;term cycling. The advanced GDY/BP/GDY&#8208;E exhibits excellent high&#8208;rate performance (1418.8 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1) and cycling stability (391.7 mAh g&#8211;1 after 5000 cycles at 10 A g&#8722;1). Such structural design of electrode materials shows a new way to develop high&#8208;performance electrodes.

         <title>A New Strategy to Elevate Absorptivity of AIEgens for Intensified NIR&#8208;II Emission and Synergized Multimodality Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 47, November 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple but efficient design strategy is discovered, involving the introduction of gold(I) unit, which could effectively elevate the absorptivity of AIEgens. The integration of gold(I) confers the AIE ligand with much higher photothermal conversion efficiency, more superior NIR&#8208;II luminescence, and high&#8208;efficiency cancer therapeutic ability.








Abstract
High&#8208;efficiency absorptivity is crucial for the construction of high&#8208;performance luminescent materials, especially the long&#8208;wavelength near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II) materials; thus seeking an efficient and universal strategy to elevate the absorptivity is extremely important but is still an intractable challenge. In this work, a simple but efficient design strategy is discovered, involving the introduction of gold(I) unit that could effectively elevate the absorptivity of aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission luminogens (AIEgens). As a result of the efficient elevation of absorptivity, the representative AIE&#8208;active TBTP&#8208;Au shows more superior NIR&#8208;II (1220&#160;nm) luminescence, much higher photothermal conversion efficiency, and unique intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#160;generating ability compared with that of the TBTP ligand. Taking advantage of these improvements, the fabricated tumor&#8208;targeting TBTP&#8208;Au&#8208;cRGD nanoparticles achieve specific NIR&#8208;II tumorous imaging in vivo and exert high&#8208;efficiency cancer therapy via the synergistic chemotherapy and photothermal therapy. Thus, this work provides a new and efficient strategy to construct high&#8208;absorption luminescent materials and demonstrates the great potential of gold(I)&#8208;based AIEgens as multifunctional theranostic agents.

Wearable Haptic Auxetic Fabric
In article number 2304442, Il&#8208;Kwon Oh and co&#8208;workers unveil an easy&#8208;to&#8208;wear, multimodal, wearable haptic auxetic fabric (WHAF) prepared by knotting shape&#8208;memory alloy wires into an auxetic&#8208;architectured fabric. Incorporating meta&#8208;design allows the WHAF to seamlessly adapt to skin contours, and surface electrical properties of the WHAF are modulated to deliver zone&#8208;specified tactile feedback to users, bridging between the real and virtual worlds.

Multifunctional Theranostic Agents
Low absorptivity is still a common challenge in the development of new luminescent materials. In article number 2306616, Lei Zheng, Feng Xu, Guorui Jin, Ben Zhong Tang, and co&#8208;workers report a simple, efficient and universal design strategy by introducing a gold(I) unit to luminescent molecules, especially NIR&#8208;II molecules, to elevate their absorptivity for intensified NIR&#8208;II emission and synergized multimodality therapy.

Scanning SQUID&#8208;on&#8208;tip Microscopy
Using SQUID&#8208;on&#8208;tip magnetic imaging of CrSBr, a van der Waals material 2D antiferromagnet, Avia Noah, Samuel Ma&#241;as&#8208;Valero, Elton J. G. Santos, Yonathan Anahory, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate that the magnetic anisotropy and moment density are nearly preserved down to the monolayer. This image reveals the formation of N&#233;el magnetic domain walls down to the monolayer. This material shows remarkable stability even for monolayer exposed to air.

Self&#8208;Healing Coatings
Triggers related to the onset of corrosion, such as the presence of OH&#8722;, H+, or change of electrode potential, leads to the release of inhibitors and film&#8208;forming agents from coatings. This new generation of self&#8208;healing materials allows the lifetime of coated metallic structures to be prolonged. More details can be found in article number 2300101 by Tiwa Yimyai, Daniel Crespy, and Michael Rohwerder.

3D Structural Coloration
Advanced coloration methods are of pivotal importance in science, technology, and engineering. In article number 2303256 by Bo Zhang, Dezhi Tan, Jianrong Qiu, and co&#8208;workers report the achievement of an unprecedented facile voxel&#8208;level programmable 3D structural coloration in bulk lithium niobate crystals. Micro/nano&#8208;scale color voxels can be quickly inscribed into any spatial position of the matrix in one step. This principle is anticipated to boost the applications of structural coloration in 3D displays, encryption, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and data storage.

         <title>Flexible Electrodes for Brain&#8211;Computer Interface System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 47, November 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The brain projects around the world, the classification of electrical neural signals, the applications of brain&#8211;computer interface, drawbacks of rigid electrodes, and the necessity to switch to flexible electrodes, are briefly introduced in this article. Then the classification of different type of electrodes, electrode materials, fabrication methods, flexible substrates, and extra requirements for flexible electrodes have been systematically reviewed.








Abstract
Brain&#8211;computer interface (BCI) has been the subject of extensive research recently. Governments and companies have substantially invested in relevant research and applications. The restoration of communication and motor function, the treatment of psychological disorders, gaming, and other daily and therapeutic applications all benefit from BCI. The electrodes hold the key to the essential, fundamental BCI precondition of electrical brain activity detection and delivery. However, the traditional rigid electrodes are limited due to their mismatch in Young's modulus, potential damages to the human body, and a decline in signal quality with time. These factors make the development of flexible electrodes vital and urgent. Flexible electrodes made of soft materials have grown in popularity in recent years as an alternative to conventional rigid electrodes because they offer greater conformance, the potential for higher signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (SNR)&#160;signals, and a wider range of applications. Therefore, the latest classifications and future developmental directions of fabricating these flexible electrodes are explored in this paper to further encourage the speedy advent of flexible electrodes for BCI. In summary, the perspectives and future outlook for this developing discipline are provided.

         <title>Water Activation in Solar&#8208;Powered Vapor Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 47, November 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive understanding on theoretical analyses about vaporization enthalpy, general calculation, and characterization means related to solar&#8208;powered water evaporation and the mechanisms of water activation to reduce the enthalpy are outlined. Furthermore, the typical representative and milestone works in solar&#8208;powered vapor generation are summarized, aiming to provide a relatively complete development chain and introduce a faster insight into this direction.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;powered vapor evaporation (SVG), based on the liquid&#8208;gas phase conversion concept using solar energy, has been given close attention as a promising technology to address the global water shortage. At molecular level, water molecules escaping from liquid water should overcome the attraction of the molecules on the liquid surface layer to evaporate. For this reason, it is better to reduce the energy required for evaporation by breaking a smaller number of hydrogen bonds or forming weak hydrogen bonds to ensure efficient and convenient vapor production. Many novel evaporator materials and effective water activation strategies have been proposed to stimulate rapid steam production and surpass the theoretical thermal limit. However, an in&#8208;depth understanding of the phase/enthalpy change process of water evaporation is unclear. In this review, a summary of theoretical analyses of vaporization enthalpy, general calculations, and characterization methods is provided. Various water activation mechanisms are also outlined to reduce evaporation enthalpy in evaporators. Moreover, unsolved issues associated with water activation are critically discussed to provide a direction for future research. Meanwhile, significant pioneering developments made in SVG are highlighted, hoping to provide a relatively entire chain for more scholars who are just stepping into this field.

         <title>Corrosion&#8208;Responsive Self&#8208;Healing Coatings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 47, November 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of so&#8208;called smart organic coatings for anticorrosion application involves stimuli&#8208;responsive materials with a self&#8208;healing ability. For this, it is of crucial importance to understand various aspects related to the storage and release of self&#8208;healing agents, as well as the spreading of the trigger signal. The requirements and possibilities for designing self&#8208;healing materials for corrosion protection are discussed.








Abstract
Organic coatings are one of the most popular and powerful strategies for protecting metals against corrosion. They can be applied in different ways, such as by dipping, spraying, electrophoresis, casting, painting, or flow coating. They offer great flexibility of material designs and cost effectiveness. Moreover, self&#8208;healing has evolved as a new research topic for protective organic coatings in the last two decades. Responsive materials play a crucial role in this new research field. However, for targeting the development of high&#8208;performance self&#8208;healing coatings for corrosion protection, it is not sufficient just to focus on smart responsive materials and suitable active agents for self&#8208;healing. A better understanding of how coatings can react on different stimuli induced by corrosion, how these stimuli can spread in the coating, and how the released agents can reach the corroding defect is also of high importance. Such knowledge would allow the&#160;design of coatings that are optimized for specific applications. Herein, the requirements and possibilities from the corrosion and synthesis perspectives for designing materials for preparing self&#8208;healing coatings for corrosion protection are discussed.

         <title>Resonant&#8208;Cavity&#8208;Enhanced Electrochromic Materials and Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 47, November 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Resonant&#8208;cavity&#8208;enhanced electrochromic materials and devices demonstrate significant potential to enable multicolor characteristics, fast response times, and long cycling lifetimes. This review focuses on the up&#8208;to&#8208;date achievements and some issues remaining for the future development of emerging electrochromic materials and devices based on different types of optical resonators, as well as the potential extended applications of these materials and devices.








Abstract
With rapid advances in optoelectronics, electrochromic materials and devices have received tremendous attentions from both industry and academia for their strong potentials in wearable and portable electronics, displays/billboards, adaptive camouflage, tunable optics, and intelligent devices, etc. However, conventional electrochromic materials and devices typically present some serious limitations such as undesirable dull colors, and long switching time, hindering their deeper development. Optical resonators have been proven to be the most powerful platform for providing strong optical confinement and controllable lightmatter interactions. They generate locally enhanced electromagnetic near&#8208;fields that can convert small refractive index changes in electrochromic materials into high&#8208;contrast color variations, enabling multicolor or even panchromatic tuning of electrochromic materials. Here, resonant&#8208;cavity&#8208;enhanced electrochromic materials and devices, an advanced and emerging trend in electrochromics, are reviewed. In this review, w e will focus on the progress in multicolor electrochromic materials and devices based on different types of optical resonators and their advanced and emerging applications, including multichromatic displays, adaptive visible camouflage, visualized energy storage, and applications of multispectral tunability. Among these topics, principles of optical resonators, related materials/devices and multicolor electrochromic properties are comprehensively discussed and summarized. Finally, the challenges and prospects for resonant&#8208;cavity&#8208;enhanced electrochromic materials and devices are presented.

         <title>Heterostructures Regulating Lithium Polysulfides for Advanced Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 47, November 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterostructures could regulate lithium polysulfides by efficient catalysis and strong adsorption to solve the problems of poor reaction kinetics and serious shuttling effect of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. This review systematically and detailedly analyzes the principle and the application of heterostructures as sulfur host, interlayer, and separator modifier to promote the performance of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries.








Abstract
Sluggish reaction kinetics and severe shuttling effect of lithium polysulfides seriously hinder the development of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. Heterostructures, due to unique properties, have congenital advantages that are difficult to be achieved by single&#8208;component materials in regulating lithium polysulfides by efficient catalysis and strong adsorption to solve the problems of poor reaction kinetics and serious shuttling effect of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. In this review, the principles of heterostructures expediting lithium polysulfides conversion and anchoring lithium polysulfides are detailedly analyzed, and the application of heterostructures as sulfur host, interlayer, and separator modifier to improve the performance of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries is systematically reviewed. Finally, the problems that need to be solved in the future study and application of heterostructures in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries are prospected. This review will provide a valuable reference for the development of heterostructures in advanced lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries.

         <title>Modeling Single&#8208;Atom Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electronic structure calculations are an essential complement to experiments to characterize single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). However, simulating SACs with quantum chemistry approaches is not as simple as often thought. Unless a number of essential aspects are adequately considered, the predictive power of electronic structure calculations remains limited. This perspective discusses&#160;what aspects need to be included to perform a reliable simulation of SACs.








Abstract
Electronic structure calculations represent an essential complement of experiments to characterize single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), consisting of isolated metal atoms stabilized on a support, but also to predict new catalysts. However, simulating SACs with quantum chemistry approaches is not as simple as often assumed. In this work,&#160;the essential factors that characterize a reliable simulation of SACs activity are examined. The Perspective focuses on the importance of precise atomistic characterization of the active site, since even small changes in the metal atom's surroundings can result in large changes in reactivity. The dynamical behavior and stability of SACs under working conditions, as well as the importance of adopting appropriate methods to solve the Schr&#246;dinger equation for a quantitative evaluation of reaction energies are addressed. The Perspective also focuses on the relevance of the model adopted. For electrocatalysis this must include the effects of the solvent, the presence of electrolytes, the pH, and the external potential. Finally, it is discussed how the similarities between SACs and coordination compounds may result in reaction intermediates that usually are not observed on metal electrodes. When these aspects are not adequately considered, the predictive power of electronic structure calculations is quite limited.

The organic&#8208;solvent&#8208;free &#8220;Lego&#8208;like&#8221; modular construction platform helps prepare Fab&#8208;nondestructive antibody&#8208;drug conjugates (ADCs) with ultrahigh drug&#8208;antibody ratio (DAR) that can be used for personalized anticancer therapy. According to the platform, aHER2&#8208;P&#8208;MMAE with a DAR of 41.6 achieves tumor growth inhibition (TGI) of 99.7% for medium&#8208;sized and large ovarian tumors. Moreover, aPDL1&#8208;P&#8208;MMAE (DAR = 40.7) achieves TGI of 98.5% for colon tumors.








Abstract
Antibody&#8208;drug conjugates (ADCs) have exciting possibilities in targeted tumor therapy. However, in the existing ADC preparation processes, the random attachment of the payloads to the antigen&#8208;binding fragments (Fab) greatly increases the risk of disrupting its antigen recognition ability, while the drug&#8208;antibody ratio&#160;(DAR) is low, leading to a cumbersome preparation process and low drug delivery efficiency. Herein, poly(glutamic acid) is used to expand the number of drug binding sites, based on the &#8220;click chemistry&#8221; of azide and DBCO, and the high affinity of Fc&#8208;III&#8208;4C peptide to the crystalline fragment (Fc) of the monoclonal antibodies. Various antibody&#8208;polymer&#8208;drug conjugates are obtained with ultrahigh DAR using this organic&#8208;solvent&#8208;free &#8220;Lego&#8208;like&#8221; modular construction. Among them, aHER2&#8208;P&#8208;MMAE with DAR of 41.6 achieves tumor growth inhibition (TGI) of 99.7% for both medium&#8208;sized and large SKOV&#8208;3 ovarian tumors, and aPDL1&#8208;P&#8208;MMAE (DAR = 40.7) achieves TGI of 98.5% for MC38 colon tumors. In summary, a universal platform is created to prepare Fab&#8208;nondestructive ADCs with ultrahigh DAR, which can be used to develop precision medicine for personalized anticancer therapy.

         <title>Spatially Controlled UV Light Generation at Depth using Upconversion Micelles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
UV light can trigger diverse photochemical reactions, yet it is extremely challenging to deliver these high&#8208;energy photons beyond the surface. Triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) shows great promise to tackle this issue. To demonstrate precision photochemistry at depth, UV&#8208;emitting UC micelles are deployed to photolyze a fluorophore at a focal point nearly a centimeter deep within an aqueous solution.








Abstract
UV light can trigger a plethora of useful photochemical reactions for diverse applications, including photocatalysis, photopolymerization, and drug delivery. These applications typically require penetration of high&#8208;energy photons deep into materials, yet delivering these photons beyond the surface is extremely challenging due to absorption and scattering effects. Triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) shows great promise to circumvent this issue by generating high&#8208;energy photons from incident lower&#8208;energy photons. However, molecules that facilitate TTA&#8208;UC usually have poor water solubility, limiting their deployment in aqueous environments. To address this challenge, a nanoencapsulation method is leveraged to fabricate water&#8208;compatible UC micelles, enabling on&#8208;demand UV photon generation deep into materials. Two iridium&#8208;based complexes are presented for use as TTA&#8208;UC sensitizers with increased solubilities that facilitate the formation of highly emissive UV&#8208;upconverting micelles. Furthermore, this encapsulation method is shown to be generalizable to nineteen UV&#8208;emitting UC systems, accessing a range of upconverted UV emission profiles with wavelengths as low as 350&#160;nm. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle demonstration of precision photochemistry at depth, UV&#8208;emitting UC micelles are used to photolyze a fluorophore at a focal point nearly a centimeter beyond the surface, revealing opportunities for spatially controlled manipulation deep into UV&#8208;responsive materials.

         <title>Intermediate Phase Free &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 Perovskite via Green Solvent Assisted Perovskite Single Crystal Redissolution Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#945;&#8208;phase formamidinium lead triiodide perovskite single crystal redissolution strategy facilitates direct &#945;&#8208;phase formation with inhibition of complex intermediate phases due to the larger&#8208;sized colloidal clusters present in the precursor solution. The resultant film demonstrates significantly improved crystallization and mitigated defects. This strategy relaxes the lattice strain through isotropic orientation phase growth, contributing to the prolonged &#945;&#8208;phase stability.








Abstract
Perovskite single&#8208;crystal redissolution (PSCR) strategy is highly desired for efficient formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI3) perovskite photovoltaics with enhanced phase purity, improved film quality, low trap&#8208;state density, and good stability. However, the phase transition and crystallization dynamics of FAPbI3 remain unclear in the PSCR process compared to the conventional fabrication from the mixing of precursor materials. In this work, a green&#8208;solvent&#8208;assisted (GSA) method is employed to synthesize centimeter&#8208;sized &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 single crystals, which serve as the high&#8208;purity precursor to fabricate perovskite films. The &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 PSCR strategy facilitates direct &#945;&#8208;phase formation and inhibits the complex intermediate phases monitored by in situ grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering. Moreover, the &#945;&#8208;phase stability is prolonged due to the relaxation of the residual lattice strain through the isotropic orientation phase growth. Consequently, the GSA&#8208;assisted PSCR strategy effectively promotes crystallization and suppresses non&#8208;radiative recombination in perovskite solar cells, which boosts the device efficiency from 22.08% to 23.92% with significantly enhanced open circuit voltage. These findings provide deeper insight into the PSCR process in terms of its efficacy in phase formation and lattice strain release. The green low&#8208;cost solvent may also offer a new and ideal solvent candidate for large&#8208;scale production of perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>Insight into Defect Engineering of Atomically Dispersed Iron Electrocatalysts for High&#8208;Performance Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsic activity of the atomically dispersed iron catalyst is controlled by defect fine&#8208;tuning to achieve remarkable electrocatalytic performance. The defects in the carbon plane modulate the valence and spin states of the Fe centers in Fe&#8208;N4. The change in the atomic and electronic structures of Fe&#8208;N4 leads to a superior MEA performance by optimizing the adsorption of oxygen intermediates.








Abstract
Atomically dispersed and nitrogen coordinated iron catalysts (Fe&#8208;NCs) demonstrate potential as alternatives to platinum&#8208;group metal (PGM) catalysts in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, in the context of practical proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) applications, the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) performances of Fe&#8208;NCs remain unsatisfactory. Herein, improved MEA performance is achieved by tuning the local environment of the Fe&#8208;NC catalysts through defect engineering. Zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF)&#8208;derived nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon with additional CO2 activation is employed to construct atomically dispersed iron sites with a controlled defect number. The Fe&#8208;NC species with the optimal number of defect sites exhibit excellent ORR performance with a high half&#8208;wave potential of 0.83&#160;V in 0.5&#160;M H2SO4. Variation in the number of defects allows for fine&#8208;tuning of the reaction intermediate binding energies by changing the contribution of the Fe d&#8208;orbitals, thereby optimizing the ORR activity. The MEA based on a defect&#8208;engineered Fe&#8208;NC catalyst is found to exhibit a remarkable peak power density of 1.1&#160;W cm&#8722;2 in an H2/O2 fuel cell, and 0.67&#160;W cm&#8722;2&#8197;in an H2/air fuel cell, rendering it one of the most active atomically dispersed catalyst materials at the MEA level.

The MEA based on a defect-engineered Fe-NC catalyst is found to exhibit a remarkable peak power density of 1.1&#160;W cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in an H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fuel cell, and 0.67&#160;W cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;in an H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/air fuel cell, rendering it one of the most active atomically dispersed catalyst materials at the MEA level.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Light&#8208;Based 3D Printing of Complex&#8208;Shaped Photonic Colloidal Glasses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photonic colloidal glasses with isotropic structural color can be shaped into complex objects by light&#8208;based 3D printing and calcination. Printed and calcined parts rely on sustainable, non&#8208;bleaching colloidal particles for color formation, making them an attractive alternative to traditional pigments in applications such as security features, displays, and sensors.








Abstract
Colloidal glasses display angle&#8208;independent structural color that is tunable by the size and local arrangement of sub&#8208;micrometer particles. While films, droplets, and microcapsules with isotropic structural color have been demonstrated, the shaping of colloidal glasses in three dimensions remains an open manufacturing challenge. Here, a light&#8208;based printing platform for the shaping of colloidal glasses into 3D objects featuring complex geometries and vivid structural color after thermal treatment is reported. Rheology, photopolymerization, and calcination experiments are performed to design the photoreactive resins leading to printable colloidal glasses. With the help of microscopy, scattering, and optical characterization, it is shown that the photonic properties of the printed objects reflect the locally ordered microstructure of the glass. The capability of the platform in creating 3D objects with isotropic structural color is illustrated by printing lattices and miniaturized sculpture replicas with unique shapes and multimaterial designs.

         <title>Exceptional Microscale Plasticity in Amorphous Aluminum Oxide at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Plasticity in ceramics, including oxide glasses, is difficult to achieve and typically occurs only at high temperatures. Amorphous aluminum oxide (a&#8208;Al2O3) makes an exception to the rule by showing substantial ductility at room temperature. The microscale compression samples (micropillars with 2.25&#8211;11 &#181;m diameter) are shown to deform without fracture even under fast impact loading resembling for example hammer forging.








Abstract
Oxide glasses are an elementary group of materials in modern society, but brittleness limits their wider usability at room temperature. As an exception to the rule, amorphous aluminum oxide (a&#8208;Al2O3) is a rare diatomic glassy material exhibiting significant nanoscale plasticity at room temperature. Here, it is shown experimentally that the room temperature plasticity of a&#8208;Al2O3 extends to the microscale and high strain rates using in situ micropillar compression. All tested a&#8208;Al2O3 micropillars deform without fracture at up to 50% strain via a combined mechanism of viscous creep and shear band slip propagation. Large&#8208;scale molecular dynamics simulations align with the main experimental observations and verify the plasticity mechanism at the atomic scale. The experimental strain rates reach magnitudes typical for impact loading scenarios, such as hammer forging, with strain rates up to the order of 1 000 s&#8722;1, and the total a&#8208;Al2O3 sample volume exhibiting significant low&#8208;temperature plasticity without fracture is expanded by 5 orders of magnitude from previous observations. The discovery is consistent with the theoretical prediction that the plasticity observed in a&#8208;Al2O3 can extend to macroscopic bulk scale and suggests that amorphous oxides show significant potential to be used as light, high&#8208;strength, and damage&#8208;tolerant engineering materials.

         <title>Engineering Single&#8208;Layer Hollow Structure of Transition Metal Dichalcogenides with High 1T&#8208;Phase Purity for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general synthetic strategy for fabricating single&#8208;layer hollow structures of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) with high 1T&#8208;phase purity is developed by selectively etching bismuth (Bi) cores from pre&#8208;synthesized Bi@TMDs core&#8211;shell heterostructures. The obtained single&#8208;layer hollow structure of 1T&#8208;MoS2 exhibits excellent electrochemical activity and durable stability in hydrogen evolution reactions.








Abstract
Rational design and controllable synthesis of hollow structures based on transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have gained tremendous attention in the field of clean energy. However, the general synthetic strategies to fabricate single&#8208;layer hollow structures of TMDs, especially with unconventional phases (e.g., 1T or 1T&#8242;), still pose significant challenges. Herein, a scalable method is reported for the synthesis of single&#8208;layer hollow spheres (SLHS) of TMDs with high 1T&#8208;phase purity by etching bismuth (Bi) cores from pre&#8208;synthesized Bi@TMDs core&#8211;shell heterostructures including SLHS&#8208;1T&#8208;MoS2, SLHS&#8208;1T&#8208;MoSe2, SLHS&#8208;1T&#8208;WS2, and SLHS&#8208;1T&#8208;WSe2. Additionally, the etched Bi ions can be adsorbed on the single&#8208;layer TMDs shells in the form of single atoms (SAs) via the Bi&#9472;S bond. Due to the benefits of the single&#8208;layer hollow structure, high conductivity of 1T phase, and synergistic effect of Bi SAs and TMDs supports, the fabricated SLHS&#8208;1T&#8208;MoS2 exhibits superior electrocatalytic performance for hydrogen production. This work provides a way to manufacture advanced functional materials based on the single&#8208;layer hollow structures of 1T&#8208;TMDs and to expand their applications.

         <title>Diels&#8211;Alder Photoclick Patterning of Extracellular Matrix for Spatially Controlled Cell Behaviors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A radical&#8208;free, Diels&#8211;Alder&#8208;based photopatterning platform is presented which enables the spatially defined modification of protein&#8208;based hydrogels with dienophile&#8208;bearing biomolecules. By utilizing commercially available maleimide&#8208;functionalized streptavidin and biotinylated species of interest, a robust mix&#8208;and&#8208;match platform is demonstrated. Through the immobilization of biotinylated growth factors, the use of these engineered substrates to program cell behaviors is highlighted.








Abstract
Strategies that mimic the spatial complexity of natural tissues can provide cellular scaffolds to probe fundamental questions in cell biology and offer new materials for regenerative medicine. Here, the authors demonstrate a light&#8208;guided patterning platform that uses natural engineered extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins as a substrate to program cellular behaviors. A photocaged diene which undergoes Diels&#8211;Alder&#8208;based click chemistry upon uncaging with 365&#160;nm light is utilized. By interfacing with commercially available maleimide dienophiles, patterning of common ECM proteins (collagen, fibronectin Matrigel, laminin) with readily purchased functional small molecules and growth factors is achieved. Finally, the use of this platform to spatially control ERK activity and migration in mammalian cells is highlighted, demonstrating programmable cell behavior through patterned chemical modification of natural ECM.

         <title>Esterase&#8208;Labile Quaternium Lipidoid Enabling Improved mRNA&#8208;LNP Stability and Spleen&#8208;Selective mRNA Transfection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of esterase&#8208;triggered decationizable quaternium lipidoids is constructed with the aim to develop new AMB&#8208;POC18 lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for robust messenger RNA (mRNA) transfection exclusively in the spleen. The AMB&#8208;POC18 LNPs encapsulating tumor antigen mRNA can effectively transfect antigen&#8208;presenting cells, induce the proliferation of effector T cells, and exhibit potent therapeutic and prophylactic efficacy against melanoma without side effects.









Abstract
Ionizable cationic lipids are recognized as an essential component of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for messenger RNA (mRNA) delivery but can be confounded by low lipoplex stability with mRNA during storage and in vivo delivery. Herein, the rational design and combinatorial synthesis of esterase&#8208;triggered decationizable quaternium lipid&#8208;like molecules (lipidoids) are reported to develop new LNPs with high delivery efficiency and improved storage stability. This top lipidoid carries positive charges at the physiological condition but promptly acquires negative charges in the presence of esterase, thus permitting stable mRNA encapsulation during storage and in vivo delivery while balancing efficient mRNA release in the cytosol. An optimal LNP formulation is then identified through orthogonal optimization, which enables efficacious mRNA transfection selectively in the spleen following intravenous administration. LNP&#8208;mediated delivery of ovalbumin (OVA)&#8208;encoding mRNA induces efficient antigen expression in antigen&#8208;presenting cells and elicits robust antigen&#8208;specific immune responses against OVA&#8208;transduced tumors. The work demonstrates the potential of decationizable quaternium lipidoids for spleen&#8208;selective RNA transfection and cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Spiral&#8208;Structured Dielectric Polymers Exhibiting Ultrahigh Energy Density and Charge&#8211;Discharge Efficiency at High Temperatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spiral&#8208;structured dielectric polymers are demonstrated to avoid the electronic conjugation of the polymer chain while maintaining a decent thermal stability, as inspired by the double helix structure of DNA, leading to ultrahigh energy density of 7.29 and 6.13 J&#160;cm&#8722;3 with charge&#8211;discharge efficiency above 90% at 150 and 200&#160;&#176;C, respectively.








Abstract
The growing need for high&#8208;power and compact&#8208;size energy storage in modern electronic and electrical systems demands polymer film capacitors with excellent temperature capability. However, conventional polymer dielectrics feature dramatic deterioration in capacitive performance under concurrent high temperature and electric field because the high thermal stability traditionally relies on the conjugated, planar molecular segments in the polymer chains. Herein, inspired by the stable double helix structures of deoxyribonucleic acid, spiral&#8208;structured dielectric polymers that exhibit simultaneous high thermal stability and great capacitive performance are demonstrated. Both the experimental results and computational simulations confirm that the spiral groups serve to weaken the electrostatic molecular interaction, induce proper molecular chain stacking structure, and regulate the charge transfer process by breaking the conjugated planes and introducing deep trap sites. The resultant polymer exhibits the maximum discharged energy densities of 7.29 and 6.13 J&#160;cm&#8722;3 with the charge&#8211;discharge efficiency above 90% at 150 and 200&#160;&#176;C, respectively, more than ten times those of the original dielectric at the same conditions. Here a completely new dimension is offered for the molecular design of polymers, giving rise to well&#8208;balanced thermal and dielectric properties, and ultimately the desired capacitive energy storage performance at high temperatures.

         <title>Tailoring the Atomic&#8208;Local Environment of Carbon Nanotube Tips for Selective H2O2 Electrosynthesis at High Current Densities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reasonably regulating the atomic&#8208;local environment of carbon&#8208;based metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts is critical for upgrading the catalytic activity of a two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction. Herein, N,S co&#8208;modified atomic environment of carbon nanotube (CNT) zigzag edges is developed, which endows the CNTs with high activity, selectivity, and stability for electrochemical H2O2 synthesis from the air in both flow cell and solid&#8208;electrolyte configuration.








Abstract
The atomic&#8208;local environment of catalytically active sites plays an important role in tuning the activity of carbon&#8208;based metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts (C&#8208;MFECs). However, the rational regulation of the environment is always impeded by synthetic limitations and insufficient understanding of the formation mechanism of the catalytic sites. Herein, the possible cleavage mechanism of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) through the crossing points during ball&#8208;milling is proposed, resulting in abundant CNT tips that are more susceptible to be modified by heteroatoms, achieving precise modulation of the atomic environment at the tips. The obtained CNTs with N,S&#8208;rich tips (N,S&#8208;TCNTs) exhibit a wide potential window of 0.59&#160;V along with H2O2 selectivity for over 90.0%. Even using air as the O2 source, the flow cell system with N,S&#8208;TCNTs catalyst attains high H2O2 productivity up to 30.37&#160;mol&#160;gcat.&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1@350&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, superior to most reported C&#8208;MFECs. From a practical point of view, a solid electrolyzer based on N,S&#8208;TCNTs is further employed to realize the in&#8208;situ continuous generation of pure H2O2 solution with high productivity (up to 4.35&#160;mmol&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1@300&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2; over 300&#160;h). The CNTs with functionalized tips hold great promise for practical applications, even beyond H2O2 generation.

         <title>Color&#8208;Tunable, Excitation&#8208;Dependent, and Water Stimulus&#8208;Responsive Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Cellulose for Versatile Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combined with the advantages of conventional conjugated aromatic luminescence and macromolecular cluster luminescence, a variety of cellulose derivatives with 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridine rings are synthesized through the Hantzsch reaction. The resulting transparent films exhibit color&#8208;tunable, excitation&#8208;dependent, and water stimulus&#8208;response afterglows, giving an impressive room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence lifetime of up to 1251&#160;ms.








Abstract
Smart&#8208;response materials with ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) are highly desirable, but they have rarely been described, especially those originating from sustainable polymers. Herein, a variety of cellulose derivatives with 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridine (DHP) rings are synthesized through the Hantzsch reaction, giving impressive RTP with a long lifetime of up to 1251&#160;ms. Specifically, the introduction of acetoacetyl groups and DHP rings promotes the spin&#8208;orbit coupling and intersystem crossing process; and multiple interactions between cellulose induce clustering and inhibit the nonradiative transitions, boosting long&#8208;live RTP. Furthermore, the resulting transparent and flexible cellulose films also exhibit excitation&#8208;dependent and color&#8208;tunable afterglows by introducing different extended aromatic groups. More interestingly, the RTP performance of these films is sensitive to water and can be repeated in response to wet/dry stimuli. Inspired by these advantages, the RTP cellulose demonstrates advanced applications in information encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. This work not only enriches the photophysical properties of cellulose but also provides a versatile platform for the development of sustainable afterglows.

         <title>Permittivity&#8208;Based Microparticle Classification by the Integration of Impedance Cytometry and Microwave Resonators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Material classification is achieved by measuring the permittivity of individual microparticles through a novel sensing platform that combines impedance cytometry and microwave resonant sensing in a microfluidic chip. Polystyrene and soda&#8208;lime glass microparticles are successfully classified, while differentiating between healthy and fixed cells. This paves the way for targeted applications in environmental monitoring and pharmaceutical quality control.








Abstract
Permittivity of microscopic particles can be used as a classification parameter for applications in materials and environmental sciences. However, directly measuring the permittivity of individual microparticles has proven to be challenging due to the convoluting effect of particle size on capacitive signals. To overcome this challenge, a sensing platform is built to independently obtain both the geometric and electric size of a particle, by combining impedance cytometry and microwave resonant sensing in a microfluidic chip. This way the microwave signal, which contains both permittivity and size effects, can be normalized by the size information provided by impedance cytometry to yield an intensive parameter that depends only on permittivity. The technique allows to differentiate between polystyrene and soda lime glass microparticles&#8212;below 22&#160;&#181;m in diameter&#8212;with more than 94% accuracy, despite their similar sizes and electrical characteristics. Furthermore, it is shown that the same technique can be used to differentiate between normal healthy cells and fixed cells of the same geometric size. The technique offers a potential route for targeted applications such as environmental monitoring of microplastic pollution or quality control in pharmaceutical industry.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Body Biomarker Entrapment System: An All&#8208;Encompassing Tool for Ultrasensitive Disease Diagnosis and Epidemic Screening</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel multi&#8208;body biomarker entrapment system based on a carbon nanotube liquid&#8208;gate field&#8208;effect transistor and DNA framework engineering is proposed. This versatile platform enables clinical diagnosis of endometriosis, specific recognition of monkeypox virus antigen protein, and non&#8208;amplification identification of circulating tumor DNA in triple&#8208;negative breast cancer.








Abstract
Ultrasensitive identification of biomarkers in biofluids is essential for the precise diagnosis of diseases. For the gold standard approaches, polymerase chain reaction and enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay, cumbersome operational steps hinder their point&#8208;of&#8208;care applications. Here, a bionic biomarker entrapment system (BioES) is implemented, which employs a multi&#8208;body Y&#8208;shaped tetrahedral DNA probe immobilized on carbon nanotube transistors. Clinical identification of endometriosis is successfully realized by detecting an estrogen receptor, ER&#946;, from the lesion tissue of endometriosis patients and establishing a standard diagnosis procedure. The multi&#8208;body Y&#8208;shaped BioES achieves a theoretical limit of detection (LoD) of 6.74 aM and a limit of quantification&#160;of 141&#160;aM in a complex protein milieu. Furthermore, the BioES is optimized into a multi&#8208;site recognition module for enhanced binding efficiency, realizing the first identification of monkeypox virus antigen A35R and unamplified detection of circulating tumor DNA of breast cancer in serum. The rigid and compact probe framework with synergy effect enables the BioES to target A35R and DNA with a LoD down to 991 and 0.21&#160;aM, respectively. Owing to its versatility for proteins and nucleic acids as well as ease of manipulation and ultra&#8208;sensitivity, the BioES can be leveraged as an all&#8208;encompassing tool for population&#8208;wide screening of epidemics and clinical disease diagnosis.

         <title>Enriching Metal&#8211;Oxygen Species and Phosphate Modulating of Active Sites for Robust Electrocatalytical CO2 Reduction</title>

The surface PO43&#8208; anions modulate the local microenvironment with abundant K+ ions and accelerate the formation of metal&#8211;oxygen species, optimize the electronic structure of the catalysts, and inhibit the side reaction of hydrogen evolution reaction, thus delivering a high jHCOO&#8722; of 279.3&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.1&#160;V versus RHE.








Abstract
Direct electrochemical reduction of CO2 (CO2RR) into value&#8208;added chemicals is a promising solution to reduce carbon emissions. The activity of CO2RR is influenced deeply by the reaction microenvironment and electronic properties of the catalysts. Herein, the surface PO43&#8722; anions are tuned to modulate the local microenvironment and the electronic properties of the indium&#8208;based catalyst with abundant metal&#8211;oxygen species enabling efficient electrochemical conversion of CO2 to HCOO&#8722;. Indium nanoparticles coupled with PO43&#8722; anions (PO43&#8722;&#8208;In NPs) achieve a high selectivity of HCOO&#8722; up to 91.4% at a low potential of &#8722;0.98&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (versus RHE) and a high HCOO&#8722; partial current density of 279.3&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.1&#160;V versus RHE in the electrochemical flow cell. In&#160;situ and ex&#160;situ characterizations confirm the PO43&#8722; anions keep stable on the surface of indium during CO2RR, accelerating the generation of OCHO* intermediate. From density functional theory calculations, PO43&#8722; anions enrich the metal&#8211;oxygen species on the substrate to optimize the electronic structure of the catalysts and induce a local microenvironment with massive K+ ions on the interface, thus reducing the activation energy barrier of CO2RR.

         <title>Compact Hole&#8208;Selective Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers Enabled by Disassembling Micelles in Solution for Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The co&#8208;solvent strategy to disassemble the micelles formed by the amphiphilic self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM)&#160;molecules is introduced. The pre&#8208;disassembly of micelles reduces the energetic barrier to form a densely packed SAM. This strategy universally enhances the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PSCs based on MeO&#8208;2PACz, 2PACz, and CbzNaph SAM hole&#8208;selective layers. The champion device based on the CbzNaph processed from co&#8208;solvent achieves a high PCE of 24.98% with an impressive fill factor of 85.06%.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) are widely employed as effective hole&#8208;selective layers (HSLs) in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, most SAM molecules are amphiphilic in nature and tend to form micelles in the commonly used alcoholic processing solvents. This introduces an extra energetic barrier to disassemble the micelles during the binding of SAM molecules on the substrate surface, limiting the formation of a compact SAM. To alleviate this problem for achieving optimal SAM growth, a co&#8208;solvent strategy to disassemble the micelles of carbazole&#8208;based SAM molecules in the processing solution is developed. This effectively increases the critical micelle concentration to be above the processing concentration and enhances the reactivity of the phosphonic acid anchoring group to allow densely packed SAMs to be formed on indium tin oxide. Consequently, the PSCs derived from using MeO&#8208;2PACz, 2PACz, and CbzNaph SAM HSLs show universally improved performance, with the CbzNaph SAM&#8208;derived device achieving a champion efficiency of 24.98% and improved stability.

         <title>A Low&#8208;Voltage, High&#8208;Force Capacity Electroadhesive Clutch Based on Ionoelastomer Heterojunctions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tough ionoelastomer&#8208;metal mesh composites with low surface energies and controlled surface roughness are synthesized to realize sub&#8208;ten&#8208;volt clutches that are small, strong, and easily detachable. Models from fracture mechanics explain how clutch compliance and surface roughness affect force capacity. These ionoelastomer clutches outperform the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art by 5&#8208;fold in force capacity per unit area, with a 40&#8208;fold reduction in operating voltage.








Abstract
Electroadhesive devices with dielectric films can electrically program changes in stiffness and adhesion, but require hundreds of volts and are subject to failure by dielectric breakdown. Recent work on ionoelastomer heterojunctions has enabled reversible electroadhesion with low voltages, but these materials exhibit limited force capacities and high detachment forces. It is a grand challenge to engineer electroadhesives with large force capacities and programmable detachment at low voltages (&lt;10&#160;V). In this work, tough ionoelastomer/metal mesh composites with low surface energies are synthesized and surface roughness is controlled to realize sub&#8208;ten&#8208;volt clutches that are small, strong, and easily detachable. Models based on fracture and contact mechanics explain how clutch compliance and surface texture affect force capacity and contact area, which is validated over different geometries and voltages. These ionoelastomer clutches outperform the best existing electroadhesive clutches by fivefold in force capacity per unit area (102 N cm&#8722;2), with a 40&#8208;fold reduction in operating voltage (&#177; 7.5&#160;V).

     alt="A Low-Voltage, High-Force Capacity Electroadhesive Clutch Based on Ionoelastomer Heterojunctions"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tough ionoelastomer-metal mesh composites with low surface energies and controlled surface roughness are synthesized to realize sub-ten-volt clutches that are small, strong, and easily detachable. Models from fracture mechanics explain how clutch compliance and surface roughness affect force capacity. These ionoelastomer clutches outperform the state-of-the-art by 5-fold in force capacity per unit area, with a 40-fold reduction in operating voltage.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electroadhesive devices with dielectric films can electrically program changes in stiffness and adhesion, but require hundreds of volts and are subject to failure by dielectric breakdown. Recent work on ionoelastomer heterojunctions has enabled reversible electroadhesion with low voltages, but these materials exhibit limited force capacities and high detachment forces. It is a grand challenge to engineer electroadhesives with large force capacities and programmable detachment at low voltages (&amp;lt;10&#160;V). In this work, tough ionoelastomer/metal mesh composites with low surface energies are synthesized and surface roughness is controlled to realize sub-ten-volt clutches that are small, strong, and easily detachable. Models based on fracture and contact mechanics explain how clutch compliance and surface texture affect force capacity and contact area, which is validated over different geometries and voltages. These ionoelastomer clutches outperform the best existing electroadhesive clutches by fivefold in force capacity per unit area (102 N cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), with a 40-fold reduction in operating voltage (&#177; 7.5&#160;V). Finally, the ability of the ionoelastomer clutches to resist bending moments in a finger wearable and as a reversible adhesive in an adjustable phone mount is demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Rate Lithium&#8211;Selenium Batteries Boosted by a Multifunctional Janus Separator Over a Wide Temperature Range of &#8722;30 &#176;C to 60 &#176;C</title>

A Janus separator coated by hierarchical nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanocages (hNCNC) and AlN nanowires on polypropylene separator is constructed to achieve high&#8208;rate performances of Li&#8211;Se batteries over &#8722;30&#8211;60 &#176;C. The excellent performances result from &#8220;1+1&gt;2&#8221; synergism of suppressed &#8216;shuttling effect&#8217; by hNCNC on cathode side and suppressed Li&#8208;dendrites by AlN&#8208;network on anode side, well understood by the &#8220;Bucket Effect&#8221;.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;selenium batteries are characterized by high volumetric capacity comparable to Li&#8211;S batteries, while &#8776;1025 times higher electrical conductivity of Se than S is favorable for high&#8208;rate capability. However, they also suffer from the &#8220;shuttling effect&#8221; of lithium polyselenides (LPSes) and Li dendrite growth. Herein, a multifunctional Janus separator is designed by coating hierarchical nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanocages (hNCNC) and AlN nanowires on two sides of commercial polypropylene (PP) separator to overcome these hindrances. At room temperature, the Li&#8211;Se batteries with the Janus separator exhibit an unprecedented high&#8208;rate capability (331 mAh g&#8722;1 at 25 C) and retain a high capacity of 408 mAh g&#8722;1 at 3 C after 500 cycles. Moreover, the high retained capacities are achieved over a wide temperature range from &#8722;30 &#176;C to 60 &#176;C, showing the potential application under extreme environments. The excellent performances result from the &#8220;1+1&gt;2&#8221; synergism of suppressed LPSes shuttling by chemisorption and electrocatalysis of hNCNC on the cathode side and suppressed Li&#8208;dendrite growth by thermally conductive AlN&#8208;network on the anode side, which can be well understood by the &#8220;Bucket Effect&#8221;. This Janus separator provides a general strategy to develop high&#8208;performance lithium&#8211;chalcogen (Se, S, SeS2) batteries.

         <title>Realizing Unassisted Photo&#8208;Charging of Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries by Anisotropic Charge Separation in Photoelectrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anisotropic photogenerated charge separation on a ZnIn2S4 photoelectrode visualized by Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) improves the charge separation, enabling unassisted photo&#8208;charging of a zinc&#8211;air battery at 1.9&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 with a light&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion efficiency of 1.45%.








Abstract
Solar rechargeable zinc&#8211;air battery is a promising approach for capturing and storing intermittent solar energy through photoelectrochemical reactions. However, unassisted photo&#8208;charging of zinc&#8211;air batteries is challenging due to suboptimal carrier accumulation on photoelectrodes, resulting in sluggish reaction kinetics. Here, unassisted photo&#8208;charging of zinc&#8211;air battery is achieved by investigating anisotropic photogenerated charge separation on a series of representative semiconductors (ZnIn2S4, TiO2, and In2O3), among which the exceptional anisotropic charge separation on a ZnIn2S4 photoelectrode is revealed based on anisotropic charge diffusion capabilities. The charge separation is facet&#8208;dependent, which is observed using Kelvin probe force microscopy, verifying a cause&#8208;and&#8208;effect relationship between the photo&#8208;charge accumulation on photoelectrodes and their photo&#8208;charging performance in zinc&#8211;air batteries. This work achieves an unassisted photo&#8208;charging current density of 1.9&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 with a light&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion efficiency of 1.45%, highlighting the importance of anisotropic semiconductors for unassisted photo&#8208;charging of zinc&#8211;air batteries via efficient photogenerated charge separation.

         <title>Modulating the Active Hydrogen Adsorption on Fe&#9472;N Interface for Boosted Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction with Ultra&#8208;Long Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Fe&#8211;N interface is designed to ameliorate the utilization of active hydrogen for electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction to suppress the occurrence of hydrogen evolution reaction. In addition, RL&#8208;Fe2N@NC harvests superb stability due to the dual reinforcement of the internal Fe2N and the external carbon layer. This catalyst exhibits trade&#8208;offs between the scale&#8208;up application and the nitrogen&#8208;neutral cycle.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic reduction of nitrate (NO3&#8722;) to nitrogen (N2) is an environmentally friendly approach for efficient N&#8208;cycle management (toward a nitrogen&#8208;neutral cycle). However, poor catalyst durability and the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction significantly impede its practical application. Interface&#8208;chemistry engineering, utilizing the close relationship between the catalyst surface/interface microenvironment and electron/proton transfer process, has facilitated the development of catalysts with high intrinsic activity and physicochemical durability. This study reports the synthesis of a nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;coated rice&#8208;like iron nitride (RL&#8208;Fe2N@NC) electrocatalyst with excellent electrocatalytic nitrate&#8208;reduction reaction activity (high N2 selectivity (&#8776;96%) and NO3&#8722; conversion (&#8776;86%)). According to detailed mechanistic investigations by in situ tests and theoretical calculations, the strong hydrogenation ability of iron nitride and enhanced nitrate enrichment of the system synergistically contribute to the rapid hydrogenation of nitrogen&#8208;containing species, increasing the intrinsic activity of the catalyst and reducing the occurrence of the competing hydrogen&#8208;evolution side reaction. Moreover, RL&#8208;Fe2N@NC shows excellent stability, retaining good NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;N2 electrocatalysis activity for more than 40 cycles (one cycle per day). This paper could guide the interfacial design of Fe&#8208;based composite nanostructures for electrocatalytic nitrate reduction, facilitating a shift toward nitrogen neutrality.

         <title>Flexible Carbon Nanotube&#8208;Epitaxially Grown Nanocrystals for Micro&#8208;Thermoelectric Modules</title>

         <dc:description>
This work presents an unconventional heteroepitaxial growth strategy to prepare high&#8208;performance flexible and freestanding thermoelectric film with ordered and uniform microstructures. The integrated micro&#8208;thermoelectric module based on the above films exhibits excellent energy harvesting and cooling performance, validating the potential of freestanding thermoelectric films for thermal energy efficient harvesting and management.








Abstract
Flexible thermoelectric materials have attracted increasing interest because of their potential use in thermal energy harvesting and high&#8208;spatial&#8208;resolution thermal management. However, a high&#8208;performance flexible micro&#8208;thermoelectric device (TED) compatible with the microelectronics fabrication process has not yet been developed.

&lt;p&gt;This work presents an unconventional heteroepitaxial growth strategy to prepare high-performance flexible and freestanding thermoelectric film with ordered and uniform microstructures. The integrated micro-thermoelectric module based on the above films exhibits excellent energy harvesting and cooling performance, validating the potential of freestanding thermoelectric films for thermal energy efficient harvesting and management.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flexible thermoelectric materials have attracted increasing interest because of their potential use in thermal energy harvesting and high-spatial-resolution thermal management. However, a high-performance flexible micro-thermoelectric device (TED) compatible with the microelectronics fabrication process has not yet been developed. Here a universal epitaxial growth strategy is reported guided by 1D van der Waals-coupling, to fabricate freestanding and flexible hybrids comprised of single-wall carbon nanotubes and ordered (Bi,Sb)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanocrystals. High power factors ranging from &#8776;1680 to &#8776;1020 &#181;W m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the temperature range of 300&#8211;480 K, combined with a low thermal conductivity yield a high average figure of merit of &#8776;0.81.

         <title>Spatial Position Regulation of Cu Single Atom Site Realizes Efficient Nanozyme Photocatalytic Bactericidal Activity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two types of Cu single&#8208;atom site nanozymes in the interlayer and in&#8208;plane of PHI are synthesized through different synthesis pathways. Compared with the Cu atoms located within the PHI plane, the interlayer position of PHI is more conducive to photoelectron migration and O2 adsorption and activation, achieving the same antibacterial effect as antibiotics.








Abstract
Recently, single&#8208;atom nanozymes have made significant progress in the fields of sterilization and treatment, but their catalytic performance as substitutes for natural enzymes and drugs is far from satisfactory. Here, a method is reported to improve enzyme activity by adjusting the spatial position of a single&#8208;atom site on the nanoplatforms. Two types of Cu single&#8208;atom site nanozymes are synthesized in the interlayer (CuL/PHI) and in&#8208;plane (CuP/PHI) of poly (heptazine imide) (PHI) through different synthesis pathways. Experimental and theoretical analysis indicates that the interlayer position of PHI can effectively adjust the coordination number, coordination bond length, and electronic structure of Cu single atoms compared to the in&#8208;plane position, thereby promoting photoinduced electron migration and O2 activation, enabling effective generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). Under visible light irradiation, the photocatalytic bactericidal activity of CuL/PHI against aureus is &#8776;100%, achieving the same antibacterial effect as antibiotics, after 10&#160;min of low&#8208;dose light exposure and 2&#160;h of incubation.

         <title>Solution Processed Semi&#8208;Transparent Organic Solar Cells Over 50% Visible Transmittance Enabled by Silver Nanowire Electrode with Sandwich Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solution&#8208;processed sandwich structure silver&#8208;nanowires top electrode is designed for semi&#8208;transparent organic photovoltaics (ST&#8208;OPVs) to address conductivity and processibility issues. Compared with traditional evaporated Ag counterpart, ST&#8208;OPV based on the new electrode achieves more excellent optical and electrical properties, including light utilization efficiency, transmittance, reflection rate, viewing angle, and can tolerate harsher mechanical bending on flexible substrates.








Abstract
Photovoltaic windows with easy installation for the power supply of household appliances have long been a desire of energy researchers. However, due to the lack of top electrodes that offer both high transparency and low sheet resistance, the development of high&#8208;transparency photovoltaic windows for indoor lighting scenarios has lagged significantly behind photovoltaic windows where privacy issues are involved. Addressing this issue, this work develops a solution&#8208;processable transparent top electrode using sandwich structure silver nanowires, realizing high transparency in semi&#8208;transparent organic solar cells. The wettability and conducting properties of the electrode are improved by a modified hole&#8208;transport layer named HP. The semi&#8208;transparent solar cell exhibits good see&#8208;through properties at a high average visible transmittance of 50.8%, with power conversion efficiency of 7.34%, and light utilization efficiency of 3.73%, which is the highest without optical modulations. Moreover, flexible devices based on the above&#8208;mentioned architecture also show excellent mechanical tolerance compared with Ag electrode counterparts, which retains 94.5% of their original efficiency after 1500 bending cycles. This work provides a valuable approach for fabricating solution&#8208;processed high transparency organic solar cells, which is essential in future applications in building integrated photovoltaics.

         <title>High&#8208;Load Gemcitabine Inorganic&#8211;Organic Hybrid Nanoparticles as an Image&#8208;Guided Tumor&#8208;Selective Drug&#8208;Delivery System to Treat Pancreatic Cancer</title>

         <dc:description>
Inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid nanoparticles with extraordinary high load of gemcitabine phosphate (GMP&#8208;IOH&#8208;NPs) show excellent efficacy to treat pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), including efficient and selective uptake to tumor and metastasis, multiscale tracking, low side effects, and circumventing chemoresistance.








Abstract
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a devastating prognosis without effective treatment options. Thus, there is an urgent need for more effective and safe therapies. Here, inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid nanoparticles (GMP&#8208;IOH&#8208;NPs) are presented as a novel drug&#8208;delivery system for the selective delivery of extraordinarily high concentrations of gemcitabine monophosphate (GMP), not only to the primary tumor but also to metastatic sites. GMP&#8208;IOH&#8208;NPs have a composition of [ZrO]2+[GMP]2&#8722; with GMP as drug anion (76% of total IOH&#8208;NP mass). Multiscale fluorescence imaging confirms an efficient uptake in tumor cells, independent of the activity of the human&#8208;equilibrative&#8208;nucleoside transporter (hENT1), being responsible for gemcitabine (GEM) transport into cells and a key factor for GEM resistance. Delivering already phosphorylated GMP via GMP&#8208;IOH&#8208;NPs into tumor cells also allows the&#160;cellular resistance induced by the downregulation of deoxycytidine kinase to be overcome. GMP&#8208;IOH&#8208;NPs show high accumulation in tumor lesions and only minor liver trapping when given intraperitoneally. GMP&#8208;IOH&#8208;NPs result in a higher antitumor efficacy compared to free GEM, which is further enhanced applying cetuximab&#8208;functionalized GMP&#8208;CTX&#8208;IOH&#8208;NPs. By maximizing the therapeutic benefits with high drug load, tumor&#8208;specific delivery, minimizing undesired side effects, overcoming mechanisms of chemoresistance, and preventing systemic GEM inactivation, GMP&#8208;IOH&#8208;NPs are anticipated to have a high chance to significantly improve current PDAC&#8208;patient outcome.

         <title>Flash&#8208;Thermal Shock Synthesis of High&#8208;Entropy Alloys Toward High&#8208;Performance Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The flash&#8208;thermal shock (FTS)&#8208;driven synthesis of high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) nanoparticles on carbon nanofibers and other 2D materials is presented. In particular, the FTS method merits scalability (6.0 &#215; 6.0 cm2), rapid synthesis (&gt;1800 &#160;&#176;C within 20 ms duration, and ramping/cooling rates &gt;104 K&#160;s&#8722;1), and ambient air processing. To prove their practical utility, high electrocatalytic activities in the hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions are demonstrated.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) provide unprecedented physicochemical properties over unary nanoparticles (NPs). According to the conventional alloying guideline (Hume&#8211;Rothery rule), however, only size&#8208;and&#8208;structure similar elements can be mixed, limiting the possible combinations of alloying elements. Recently, it has been reported that based on carbon thermal shocks (CTS) in a vacuum atmosphere at high temperature, ultrafast heating/cooling rates and high&#8208;entropy environment play a critical role in the synthesis of HEAs, ruling out the possibility of phase separation. Since the CTS requires conducting supports, the Joule&#8208;heating efficiencies rely on the carbon qualities, featuring difficulties in uniform heating along the large area. This work proposes a photo&#8208;thermal approach as an alternative and innovative synthetic method that is compatible with ambient air, large&#8208;area, remote process, and free of materials selection. Single flash irradiation on carbon nanofibers induced momentary high&#8208;temperature annealing (&gt;1800&#160;&#176;C within 20&#160;ms duration, and ramping/cooling rates &gt;104 K&#160;s&#8722;1) to successfully decorate HEA NPs up to nine elements with excellent compatibility for large&#8208;scale synthesis (6.0 &#215; 6.0 cm2 of carbon nanofiber paper). To demonstrate their feasibility toward applications, senary HEA NPs (PtIrFeNiCoCe) are designed and screened, showing high activity (&#951;overall = 777&#160;mV) and excellent stability (&gt;5000 cycles) at the water splitting, including hydrogen evolution reactions and oxygen evolution reactions.

In particular, the FTS method merits scalability (6.0 &#215; 6.0 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), rapid synthesis (&amp;gt;1800 &#160;&#176;C within 20 ms duration, and ramping/cooling rates &amp;gt;10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; K&#160;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), and ambient air processing. To prove their practical utility, high electrocatalytic activities in the hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions are demonstrated.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-entropy alloys (HEAs) provide unprecedented physicochemical properties over unary nanoparticles (NPs). According to the conventional alloying guideline (Hume&#8211;Rothery rule), however, only size-and-structure similar elements can be mixed, limiting the possible combinations of alloying elements. Recently, it has been reported that based on carbon thermal shocks (CTS) in a vacuum atmosphere at high temperature, ultrafast heating/cooling rates and high-entropy environment play a critical role in the synthesis of HEAs, ruling out the possibility of phase separation. Since the CTS requires conducting supports, the Joule-heating efficiencies rely on the carbon qualities, featuring difficulties in uniform heating along the large area. This work proposes a photo-thermal approach as an alternative and innovative synthetic method that is compatible with ambient air, large-area, remote process, and free of materials selection. Single flash irradiation on carbon nanofibers induced momentary high-temperature annealing (&amp;gt;1800&#160;&#176;C within 20&#160;ms duration, and ramping/cooling rates &amp;gt;10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; K&#160;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) to successfully decorate HEA NPs up to nine elements with excellent compatibility for large-scale synthesis (6.0 &#215; 6.0 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of carbon nanofiber paper). To demonstrate their feasibility toward applications, senary HEA NPs (PtIrFeNiCoCe) are designed and screened, showing high activity (&#951;&lt;sub&gt;overall&lt;/sub&gt; = 777&#160;mV) and excellent stability (&amp;gt;5000 cycles) at the water splitting, including hydrogen evolution reactions and oxygen evolution reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bulk&#8208;Switching Memristor&#8208;Based Compute&#8208;In&#8208;Memory Module for Deep Neural Network Training</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A compute&#8208;in&#8208;memory module integrated with bulk&#8208;switching memristor arrays is demonstrated. A hardware&#8211;software co&#8208;designed system is constructed to accelerate the neural network training and relax stringent requirements for device precision and endurance. The on&#8208;chip trained networks are able to reach software&#8208;comparable accuracies and exhibit robustness to weight perturbation when transferred to a new chip.








Abstract
The constant drive to achieve higher performance in deep neural networks (DNNs) has led to the proliferation of very large models. Model training, however, requires intensive computation time and energy. Memristor&#8208;based compute&#8208;in&#8208;memory (CIM) modules can perform vector&#8208;matrix multiplication (VMM) in place and in parallel, and have shown great promises in DNN inference applications. However, CIM&#8208;based model training faces challenges due to non&#8208;linear weight updates, device variations, and low&#8208;precision. In this work, a mixed&#8208;precision training scheme is experimentally implemented to mitigate these effects using a bulk&#8208;switching memristor&#8208;based CIM module. Low&#8208;precision CIM modules are used to accelerate the expensive VMM operations, with high&#8208;precision weight updates accumulated in digital units. Memristor devices are only changed when the accumulated weight update value exceeds a pre&#8208;defined threshold. The proposed scheme is implemented with a system&#8208;onchip of fully integrated analog CIM modules and digital sub&#8208;systems, showing fast convergence of LeNet training to 97.73%. The efficacy of training larger models is evaluated using realistic hardware parameters and verifies that CIM modules can enable efficient mix&#8208;precision DNN training with accuracy comparable to full&#8208;precision software&#8208;trained models. Additionally, models trained on chip are inherently robust to hardware variations, allowing direct mapping to CIM inference chips without additional re&#8208;training.

         <title>Defect Driven Opto&#8208;Critical Phases Tuned for All&#8208;Solar Utilization</title>

Strategically doped Cu and oxygen vacancies introduce defect&#8208;driven opto&#8208;critical phases in WO3&#183;H2O via a one&#8208;pot, photo&#8208;induced submerged photo&#8208;synthesis of crystallites (SPsC). This innovative method fabricates uniformly dispersed, photo&#8208;responsive Cu&#8208;doped WO3&#183;H2O nanocrystals, revealing an all&#8208;solar response across photothermal, photo&#8208;assisted water evaporation, and photo&#8208;electrochemical characteristics, directing future design of advanced oxide materials.








Abstract
Materials imbued with uniformly dispersed, photo&#8208;responsive nanoparticles are instrumental in sustainable energy and photonic applications. Conventional methods, however, constrain their all&#8208;solar response. An innovative alternative is proposed: submerged photo&#8208;synthesis of crystallites (SPsC). It is shown that strategic doping with copper and oxygen vacancies can induce opto&#8208;critical phases from the nonstoichiometric tungstic acids (WO3&#183;H2O). These opto&#8208;critical phases enable a dynamic equilibrium shift in lattice defect stabilization, facilitating an unprecedented a whole solar wavelength response. This response manifests as photothermal, photo&#8208;assisted water evaporation, and photo&#8208;electrochemical characteristics. Harnessing all&#8208;solar energy, this one&#8208;pot SPsC strategy may steer the design and development of advanced oxide materials, enhancing functionality across diverse application domains.

         <title>Virus&#8208;Based Pyroelectricity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first observation of heat&#8208;induced electrical potential generation and detection of a virus is demonstrated. Bio&#8208;pyroelectricity is manifested by the unfolding of &#945;&#8208;helical protein structure and can be tuned by genetic engineering. This biopyroelectrics introduce novel opportunities to detect various viral particles and facilitate the development of novel biomaterials for future applications in biosensors and bioelectric materials.








Abstract
The first observation of heat&#8208;induced electrical potential generation on a virus and its detection through pyroelectricity are presented. Specifically, the authors investigate the pyroelectric properties of the M13 phage, which possesses inherent dipole structures derived from the noncentrosymmetric arrangement of the major coat protein (pVIII) with an &#945;&#8208;helical conformation. Unidirectional polarization of the phage is achieved through genetic engineering of the tail protein (pIII) and template&#8208;assisted self&#8208;assembly techniques. By modifying the pVIII proteins with varying numbers of glutamate residues, the structure&#8208;dependent tunable pyroelectric properties of the phage are explored. The most polarized phage exhibits a pyroelectric coefficient of 0.13 &#181;C m&#8722;2 &#176;C&#8722;1. Computational modeling and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy analysis confirm that the unfolding of &#945;&#8208;helices within the pVIII proteins leads to changes in phage polarization upon heating. Moreover, the phage is genetically modified to enable its pyroelectric function in diverse chemical environments. This phage&#8208;based approach not only provides valuable insights into bio&#8208;pyroelectricity but also opens up new opportunities for the detection of various viral particles. Furthermore, it holds great potential for the development of novel biomaterials for future applications in biosensors and bioelectric materials.

         <title>Co&#8208;Delivery of Metabolic Modulators Leads to Simultaneous Lactate Metabolism Inhibition and Intracellular Acidification for Synergistic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sufficient amount of lactate transporter inhibitor (small molecule), glucose oxidase (enzyme), and O2&#8208;evolving nanoparticles are simultaneously delivered to cancer cells using large&#8208;pore mesoporous silica nanoparticles as a vehicle and albumin as a carrier for small molecule. This combination synergistically induces lactate metabolism inhibition and intracellular acidification, leading to severe ATP depletion and subsequent cancer cell death.








Abstract
Simultaneous lactate metabolism inhibition and intracellular acidification (LIIA) is a promising approach for inducing tumor regression by depleting ATP. However, given the limited efficacy of individual metabolic modulators, a combination of various modulators is required for highly efficient LIIA. Herein, a co&#8208;delivery system that combines lactate transporter inhibitor, glucose oxidase, and O2&#8208;evolving nanoparticles is proposed. As a vehicle, a facile room&#8208;temperature synthetic method for large&#8208;pore mesoporous silica nanoparticles (L&#8208;MSNs) is developed. O2&#8208;evolving nanoparticles are then conjugated onto L&#8208;MSNs, followed by immobilizing the lactate transporter inhibitor and glucose oxidase inside the pores of L&#8208;MSNs. To load the lactate transporter inhibitor, which is too small to be directly loaded into the large pores, it is encapsulated in albumin by controlling the albumin conformation before being loaded into L&#8208;MSNs. Notably, inhibiting lactate efflux shifts the glucose consumption mechanism from lactate metabolism to glucose oxidase reaction, which eliminates glucose and produces acid. This leads to synergistic LIIA and subsequent ATP depletion in cancer cells. Consequently, L&#8208;MSN&#8208;based co&#8208;delivery of modulators for LIIA shows high anticancer efficacy in several mouse tumor models without toxicity in normal tissues. This study provides new insights into co&#8208;delivery of small&#8208;molecule drugs, proteins, and nanoparticles for synergistic metabolic modulation in tumors.

         <title>Imaging Light&#8208;Induced Migration of Dislocations in Halide Perovskites with 3D Nanoscale Strain Mapping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halide perovskites are exciting materials for optoelectronic devices. Here, synchrotron&#8208;based Bragg coherent diffraction imaging is used to visualize nanoscale strain fields and dislocation defects. By imaging these defects and strain fields in situ under continuous illumination, dramatic light&#8208;induced dislocation migration across hundreds of nanometers is uncovered, and the impact of these defects on material performance is unveiled.








Abstract
In recent years, halide perovskite materials have been used to make high&#8208;performance solar cells and light&#8208;emitting devices. However, material defects still limit device performance and stability. Here, synchrotron&#8208;based Bragg coherent diffraction imaging is used to visualize nanoscale strain fields, such as those local to defects, in halide perovskite microcrystals. Significant strain heterogeneity within MAPbBr3 (MA = CH3NH3+) crystals is found&#160;in spite of their high optoelectronic quality, and both &#12296;100&#12297; and &#12296;110&#12297; edge dislocations are identified through analysis of their local strain fields. By imaging these defects and strain fields in situ under continuous illumination, dramatic light&#8208;induced dislocation migration across hundreds of nanometers is uncovered. Further, by selectively studying crystals that are damaged by the X&#8208;ray beam, large dislocation densities and increased nanoscale strains are correlated with material degradation and substantially altered optoelectronic properties assessed using photoluminescence microscopy measurements. These results demonstrate the dynamic nature of extended defects and strain in halide perovskites, which will have important consequences for device performance and operational stability.

         <title>Mid&#8208;Infrared Bipolar and Unipolar Linear Polarization Detections in Nb2GeTe4/MoS2 Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mid&#8208;infrared (MIR) broadband photodetector with bipolar and unipolar polarization ratios (PRs)&#160;is achieved using a 2D anisotropic/isotropic Nb2GeTe4/MoS2 van der Waals (vdWs) heterostructure. Featuring a negative PR of &#8722;3.38 and a high PR of 34 for the 3.7 and 11.0&#160;&#181;m MIR light, respectively, the photodetector demonstrates promising potential in bipolar polarization encoding communications and polarization imaging.








Abstract
Detecting and distinguishing light polarization states, one of the most basic elements of optical fields, have significant importance in both scientific studies and industry applications. Artificially fabricated structures, e.g., metasurfaces with anisotropic absorptions, have shown the capabilities of detecting polarization light and controlling. However, their operations mainly rely on resonant absorptions based on structural designs that are usually narrow bands. Here, a mid&#8208;infrared (MIR) broadband polarization photodetector with high PRs and wavelength&#8208;dependent polarities using a 2D anisotropic/isotropic Nb2GeTe4/MoS2 van der Waals (vdWs) heterostructure is demonstrated. It is shown that the photodetector exhibits high PRs of 48 and 34 at 4.6&#160; and 11.0&#160;&#181;m wavelengths, respectively, and even a negative PR of &#8722;3.38 for 3.7&#160;&#181;m under the zero bias condition at room temperature. Such interesting results can be attributed to the superimposed effects of a photovoltaic (PV) mechanism in the Nb2GeTe4/MoS2 hetero&#8208;junction region and a bolometric mechanism in the MoS2 layer. Furthermore, the photodetector demonstrates its effectiveness in bipolar and unipolar polarization encoding communications and polarization imaging enabled by its unique and high PRs.

         <title>Cooperative Rheological State&#8208;Switching of Enzymatically&#8208;Driven Composites of Circular DNA And Dextran</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Composites of circular DNA and dextran are pushed out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium via enzymatic digestion of DNA rings to linear fragments. Time&#8208;resolved rheology measurements reveal discrete state&#8208;switching, with composites undergoing abrupt transitions between dissipative and elastic&#8208;like states. Bulk state&#8208;switching is shown to arise from continuous molecular&#8208;level activity due to the necessity for cooperative percolation of entanglements to support macroscopic stresses.








Abstract
Polymer topology, which plays a principal role in the rheology of polymeric fluids, and non&#8208;equilibrium materials, which exhibit time&#8208;varying rheological properties, are topics of intense investigation. Here, composites of circular DNA and dextran are pushed out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium via enzymatic digestion of DNA rings to linear fragments. These time&#8208;resolved rheology measurements reveal discrete state&#8208;switching, with composites undergoing abrupt transitions between dissipative and elastic&#8208;like states. The gating time and lifetime of the elastic&#8208;like states, and the magnitude and sharpness of the transitions, are surprisingly decorrelated from digestion rates and non&#8208;monotonically depend on the DNA fraction. These results are modeled using sigmoidal two&#8208;state functions to show that bulk state&#8208;switching can arise from continuous molecular&#8208;level activity due to the necessity for cooperative percolation of entanglements to support macroscopic stresses. This platform, coupling the tunability of topological composites with the power of enzymatic reactions, may be leveraged for diverse material applications from wound&#8208;healing to self&#8208;repairing infrastructure.

         <title>Treatment of Ruptured Wide&#8208;Necked Aneurysms using a Microcatheter Injectable Biomaterial</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
WNAs are challenging to treat, and when they rupture, they can lead to significant mortality. In this work, it is shown that embolization of the aneurysm sac using a gel embolic agent in combination with a flow diverter stent&#160;can safely treat non&#8208;ruptured and ruptured aneurysms in large&#8208;animal models. This combinatorial approach may best treat complex WNAs and save lives.








Abstract
Ruptured wide&#8208;neck aneurysms (WNAs), especially in a setting of coagulopathy, are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. It is shown that by trapping a sub&#8208;millimeter clinical catheter inside the aneurysm sac using a flow diverter stent (FDS), instant hemostasis can be achieved by filling the aneurysm sac using a novel biomaterial, rescuing catastrophic bleeding in large&#8208;animal models. Multiple formulations of a biomaterial comprising gelatin, nanoclay (NC), and iohexol are developed, optimized, and extensively tested in vitro to select the lead candidate for further testing in vivo in murine, porcine, and canine models of WNAs, including in a subset with aneurysm rupture. The catheter&#8208;injectable and X&#8208;ray visible versions of the gel embolic agent (GEA) with the optimized mechanical properties outperform control groups, including a subset that receive a clinically used liquid embolic (Onyx, Medtronic), with and without aneurysm rupture. A combinatorial approach to ruptured WNAs with GEA and FDS may change the standard of medical practice and save lives.

         <title>Halide&#8208;Driven Synthetic Control of InSb Colloidal Quantum Dots Enables Short&#8208;Wave Infrared Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
InSb colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) show promise for extended infrared light sensing applications but face synthesis challenges due to uncontrolled reduction of precursors. Herein, the controlled growth of CQDs is achieved with well&#8208;defined excitonic transitions using zinc halide additives. The photodetectors employing ligand&#8208;exchanged CQDs achieve a 75% external quantum efficiency at 1200&#160;nm with 1&#160;V applied bias.

In the III&#8211;V family of colloidal quantum dot (CQD) semiconductors, InSb promises access to a wider range of infrared wavelengths compared to many light&#8208;sensing material candidates. However, achieving the necessary size, size&#8208;dispersity, and optical properties has been challenging. Here the synthetic challenges associated with InSb CQDs are investigated and it is found that uncontrolled reduction of the antimony precursor hampers the controlled growth of CQDs. To overcome this, a synthetic strategy that combines nonpyrophoric precursors with zinc halide additives is developed. The experimental and computational studies show that zinc halide additives decelerate the reduction of the antimony precursor, facilitating the growth of more uniformly sized CQDs. It is also found that the halide choice provides additional control over the strength of this effect. The resultant CQDs exhibit well&#8208;defined excitonic transitions in spectral range of 1.26&#8211;0.98&#160;eV, along with strong photoluminescence. By implementing a postsynthesis ligand exchange, colloidally stable inks enabling the fabrication of high&#8208;quality CQD films are achieved. The first demonstration of InSb CQD photodetectors is presented reaching 75% external quantum efficiency (QE) at 1200&#160;nm, to the knowledge the highest short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) QE reported among heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free infrared CQD&#8208;based devices.

         <title>Outer Membrane Vesicle&#8208;Based Nanohybrids Target Tumor&#8208;Associated Macrophages to Enhance Trained Immunity&#8208;Related Vaccine&#8208;Generated Antitumor Activity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Outer membrane vesicle (OMV) nanohybrids, as a trained immunity&#8208;related vaccine (TIrV), induce central and peripheral trained immunity that can be identified by metabolic and epigenetic rewiring and enhance trained immunity&#8208;related vaccine&#8208;generated antitumor activity. This TIrV&#160;targets tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) and induces different antitumor mechanisms with or without CD8 T cell activation in two distinct tumor models.








Abstract
Trained immunity refers to the innate immune system building memory&#8208;like features in response to subsequent infections and vaccinations. Compared with classical tumor vaccines, trained immunity&#8208;related vaccines (TIrV) are independent of tumor&#8208;specific antigens. Bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) contain an abundance of PAMPs and have the potential to act as TIrV&#8208;inducer, but face challenges in endotoxin tolerance, systemic delivery, long&#8208;term training, and trained tumor&#8208;associated macrophage (TAM)&#8208;mediated antitumor phagocytosis. Here, an OMV&#8208;based TIrV is developed, OMV nanohybrids (OMV&#8208;SIRP&#945;@CaP/GM&#8208;CSF) for exerting vaccine&#8208;enhanced antitumor activity. In the bone marrow, GM&#8208;CSF&#8208;assisted OMVs train bone marrow progenitor cells and monocytes, which are inherited by TAMs. In tumor tissues, SIRP&#945;&#8208;Fc&#8208;assisted OMVs trigger TAM&#8208;mediated phagocytosis. This TIrV can be identified by metabolic and epigenetic rewiring using transposase&#8208;accessible chromatin (ATAC) and transcriptome sequencing. Furthermore, it is found that the TIrV&#8208;mediated antitumor mechanism in the MC38 tumor model (TAM&#8208;hot and T cell&#8208;cold) is trained immunity and activated T cell response, whereas in the B16&#8208;F10 tumor model (T cell&#8208;hot and TAM&#8208;cold) is primarily mediated by trained immunity. This study not only develops and identifies OMV&#8208;based TIrV, but also investigates the trained immunity signatures and therapeutic mechanisms, providing a basis for further vaccination strategies.

         <title>Berry Curvature Dipole Induced Giant Mid&#8208;Infrared Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation in 2D Weyl Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Giant mid&#8208;infrared second&#8208;harmonic generation performance (better than the visible region) is demonstrated in the newly discovered Weyl semiconductor &#8722;2D Te. Theoretical calculations reveal that it originated from the large Berry curvature dipole near the Weyl points of 2D Te. Therefore, even excited by continuous&#8208;wave laser, strong sum&#8208;frequency generation can be obtained in 2D Te.








Abstract
Due to its inversion&#8208;broken triple helix structure and the nature of Weyl semiconductor, 2D Tellurene (2D Te) is promising to possess a strong nonlinear optical response in the infrared region, which is rarely reported in 2D materials. Here, a giant nonlinear infrared response induced by large Berry curvature dipole (BCD) is demonstrated in the Weyl semiconductor 2D Te. Ultrahigh second&#8208;harmonic generation response is acquired from 2D Te with a large second&#8208;order nonlinear optical susceptibility (&#967;(2)), which is up to 23.3 times higher than that of monolayer MoS2 in the range of 700&#8211;1500&#160;nm. Notably, distinct from other 2D nonlinear semiconductors, &#967;(2) of 2D Te increases extraordinarily with increasing wavelength and reaches up to 5.58&#160;nm&#160;V&#8722;1 at &#8776;2300&#160;nm, which is the best infrared performance among the reported 2D nonlinear materials. Large &#967;(2) of 2D Te also enables the high&#8208;intensity sum&#8208;frequency generation with an ultralow continuous&#8208;wave (CW) pump power. Theoretical calculations reveal that the exceptional performance is attributed to the presence of large BCD located at the Weyl points of 2D Te. These results unravel a new linkage between Weyl semiconductor and strong optical nonlinear responses, rendering 2D Te a competitive candidate for highly efficient nonlinear 2D semiconductors in the infrared region.

         <title>Shape&#8208;Configurable MXene&#8208;Based Thermoacoustic Loudspeakers with Tunable Sound Directivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin MXene thermoacoustic loudspeakers with the capability of shape configurations provide directivity&#8208;tunable and high sound generation under different mechanical deformations. MXene conductors with low heat&#8208;capacity&#8208;per&#8208;unit&#8208;area and parylene substrates with low thermal effusivity enable bidirectional and stable sound in concave/convex, on&#8208;needle, folded, and twisted configurations. High conformability can be affixed to diverse 3D&#160;surfaces, enabling focused and omnidirectional sound generation.








Abstract
Film&#8208;type shape&#8208;configurable speakers with tunable sound directivity are in high demand for wearable electronics. Flexible, thin thermoacoustic (TA) loudspeakers&#8212;which are free from bulky vibrating diaphragms&#8212;show promise in this regard. However, configuring thin TA loudspeakers into arbitrary shapes is challenging because of their low sound pressure level (SPL) under mechanical deformations and low conformability to other surfaces. By carefully controlling the heat capacity per unit area and thermal effusivity of an MXene conductor and substrates, respectively, it fabricates an ultrathin MXene&#8208;based TA loudspeaker exhibiting high SPL output (74.5&#160;dB at 15&#160;kHz) and stable sound performance for 14 days. Loudspeakers with the parylene substrate, whose thickness is less than the thermal penetration depth, generated bidirectional and deformation&#8208;independent sound in bent, twisted, cylindrical, and stretched&#8208;kirigami configurations. Furthermore, it constructs parabolic and spherical versions of ultrathin, large&#8208;area (20&#160;cm&#160;&#215;&#160;20&#160;cm) MXene&#8208;based TA loudspeakers, which display sound&#8208;focusing and 3D omnidirectional&#8208;sound&#8208;generating attributes, respectively.

Using a self&#8208;adaptive co&#8208;assembly strategy, FlavP2000 can autonomously adjust its conformation when co&#8208;assembled with DSPE&#8208;PEG2000, resulting in high&#8208;efficiency luminescence which enables NIR&#8208;IIb (&gt;1500&#160;nm) angiography with ultra&#8208;high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios. Notably, this co&#8208;assembly can also occur in situ between IPA&#8208;FlavP2000/FlavP2000 with proteins in the living body based on a novel mechanism of brightness activation induced by disassembly (BAD).








Abstract
Despite the wide range of applications of bright NIR&#8208;II polymethine scaffolds in biomedical imaging, their solvatochromism and aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) effects in aqueous solutions limit their inherent brightness using traditional encapsulation methods, and effective hydrophilization strategies are still scarce. Here, a new set of Flav dyes is synthesized and PEGylated, followed by manufacturing DSPE@FlavP2000 nanoparticles using a self&#8208;adaptive co&#8208;assembly strategy to overcome these limitations. FlavP2000 can autonomously adjust its conformation when co&#8208;assembled with DSPE&#8208;PEG2000, resulting in high&#8208;efficiency luminescence (&#8776;44.9% fluorescence of Flav in DMSO). DSPE@FlavP2000 enables NIR&#8208;IIb (&gt;1500&#160;nm) angiography with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios. Notably, this co&#8208;assembly can occur in situ between FlavP2000 with proteins in the living body based on a novel mechanism of brightness activation induced by disassembly (BAD), achieving consistent brightness as DSPE@FlavP2000 in blood or serum. The self&#8208;adaptive co&#8208;assembly strategy can be enhanced by incorporating an IPA moiety, which dynamically binds to albumin to prolong the dye's blood circulation time. Thus, the &#8220;enhanced&#8221; BAD is successfully applied to long&#8208;term vascular imaging and sciatic nerve imaging. Both the self&#8208;adaptive co&#8208;assembly strategy and BAD phenomenon improve the selectivity and availability of the hydrophilization methods, paving the way for efficient biological applications of polymethine dyes.

         <title>Microfluidic&#8208;Assembled Covalent Organic Frameworks@Ti3C2Tx MXene Vertical Fibers for High&#8208;Performance Electrochemical Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance electrochemical supercapacitor based on vertically structured covalent organic frameworks@Ti3C2Tx MXene fiber is developed via one&#8208;step microfluidic synthesis. Due to vertical ion transport channels, sufficient ion&#8208;accessible area, decreased ion adsorption energy, excellent pseudocapacitive activity, and strong interfacial electron migration, the supercapacitors exhibit large capacitance, high energy density, excellent cycling stability, and wearable applications.








Abstract
The delicate design of innovative and sophisticated fibers with vertical porous skeleton and eminent electrochemical activity to generate directional ionic pathways and good faradic charge accessibility is pivotal but challenging for realizing high&#8208;performance fiber&#8208;shaped supercapacitors (FSCs). Here, hierarchically ordered hybrid fiber combined vertical&#8208;aligned and conductive Ti3C2Tx MXene (VA&#8208;Ti3C2Tx) with interstratified electroactive covalent organic frameworks LZU1 (COF&#8208;LZU1) by one&#8208;step microfluidic synthesis is developed. Due to the incorporation of vertical channels, abundant redox active sites and large accessible surface area throughout the electrode, the VA&#8208;Ti3C2Tx@COF&#8208;LZU1 fibers express exceptional gravimetric capacitance of 787&#160;F&#160;g&#8722;1 in a three&#8208;electrode system. Additionally, the solid&#8208;state asymmetric FSCs deliver a prominent energy density of 27&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1, capacitance of 398&#160;F&#160;g&#8722;1 and cycling life of 20&#160;000 cycles. The key to high energy storage ability originates from the decreased ions adsorption energy and ameliorative charge density distribution in vertically aligned and active hybrid fiber, accelerating ions transportation/accommodation and interfacial electrons transfer. Benefiting from excellent electrochemical performance, the FSCs offer sufficient energy supply to power watches, flags, and digital display tubes as well as be integrated with sensors to detect pulse signals, which opens a promising route for architecting advanced fiber toward the carbon neutrality market beyond energy&#8208;storage technology.

         <title>Mucosa&#8208;Inspired Electro&#8208;Responsive Lubricating Supramolecular&#8208;Covalent Hydrogel</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mucosa&#8208;inspired electro&#8208;responsive lubricating hydrogel is developed based on the synergy of electro&#8208;responsive supramolecular non&#8208;covalent silk fibroin and covalent polyacrylamide and polyvinyl alcohol polymer network. It demonstrates partial gel&#8208;sol transition under the electric field to regulate the lubricating property.








Abstract
Enabling the living capability of secreting liquids dynamically triggered by external stimuli while maintaining the bulk frame is a significant challenge for mucosa&#8208;inspired hydrogels. A mucosa&#8208;inspired electro&#8208;responsive hydrogel is developed in this study using the synergy between electro&#8208;responsive silk fibroin supramolecular non&#8208;covalent networks and covalent polyacrylamide and polyvinyl alcohol polymer networks. The formed supramolecular&#8208;covalent hydrogel exhibits a partial gel&#8208;sol transition upon the application of an electric field, and the liquid layer on the hydrogel surface near the cathode is used to mimic the mucus&#8208;secreting capability to regulate lubrication. The electro&#8208;responsive lubricating process can operate under a safe voltage and exhibits good reversibility. It is also a universal strategy to construct an electro&#8208;responsive hydrogel by introducing an electro&#8208;responsive supramolecular network into the polymer network. This mucosa&#8208;inspired electro&#8208;responsive supramolecular&#8208;covalent hydrogel offers a promising method for designing soft actuators or robots that can regulate lubrication using an electric strategy.

         <title>A 3d&#8208;4d&#8208;5d High Entropy Alloy as a Bifunctional Oxygen Catalyst for Robust Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The noble metal&#8208;free 3d&#8208;4d&#8208;5d high entropy alloy, FeCoNiMoW, with high configurational entropy, subtle lattice distortions, and modulated electronic structure is an efficient bifunctional oxygen catalyst for robust aqueous, solid, and flexible zinc&#8211;air batteries.








Abstract
High entropy alloys (HEAs) are highly suitable candidate catalysts for oxygen evolution and reduction reactions (OER/ORR)&#160;as they offer numerous parameters for optimizing the electronic structure and catalytic sites. Herein, FeCoNiMoW HEA nanoparticles are synthesized using a solution&#8208;based low&#8208;temperature approach. Such FeCoNiMoW nanoparticles show high entropy properties, subtle lattice distortions, and modulated electronic structure, leading to superior OER performance with an overpotential of 233&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and 276&#160;mV at 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Density functional theory calculations reveal the electronic structures of the FeCoNiMoW active sites with an optimized d&#8208;band center position that enables suitable adsorption of OOH* intermediates and reduces the Gibbs free energy barrier in the OER process. Aqueous zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs) based on this HEA demonstrate a high open circuit potential of 1.59&#160;V, a peak power density of 116.9&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2, a specific capacity of 857&#160;mAh&#160;gZn&#8722;1, and excellent stability for over 660&#160;h of continuous charge&#8211;discharge cycles. Flexible and solid ZABs are also assembled and tested, displaying excellent charge&#8211;discharge performance at different bending angles. This work shows the significance of 4d/5d metal&#8208;modulated electronic structure and optimized adsorption ability to improve the performance of OER/ORR, ZABs, and beyond.

         <title>Mechanism for Generating H2O2 at Water&#8208;Solid Interface by Contact&#8208;Electrification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present work shows that H2O2 can be produced from water and air through oxidoreduction processes triggered by ultrasound&#8208;driven contact&#8208;electrification at the interface of water and fluorinated ethylene propylene. The performance of the method greatly surpasses present piezocatalysis. This work proposes a clear demonstration of the mechanism and the contribution of the hydrogen bound network to the formation of H2O2.








Abstract
The recent intensification of the study of contact&#8208;electrification at water&#8208;solid interfaces and its role in physicochemical processes lead to the realization that electron transfers during water&#8208;solid contact&#8208;electrification can drive chemical reactions. This mechanism, named contact&#8208;electro&#8208;catalysis (CEC), allows chemically inert fluorinated polymers to act like single electrode electrochemical systems. This study shows hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is generated from air and deionized water, by ultrasound driven CEC, using fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) as the catalyst. For a mass ratio of catalyst to solution of 1:10000, at 20&#160;&#176;C, the kinetic rate of H2O2 evolution reaches 58.87&#160;mmol&#160;L&#8722;1&#160;gcat&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) shows electrons are emitted in the solution by the charged FEP, during ultrasonication. EPR and isotope labelling experiments show H2O2 is formed from hydroxyl radicals (HO&#8226;) or two superoxide radicals (O2&#8226;&#8722;) generated by CEC. Finally, it is traditionally believed such radicals migrate in the solution by Brownian diffusion prior to reactions. However, ab&#8208;initio molecular dynamic calculations reveal the radicals can react by exchanging protons and electrons through the hydrogen bonds network of water, i.e., owing to the Grotthuss mechanism. This mechanism can be relevant to other systems, artificial or natural, generating H2O2 from air and water.

         <title>Structural Diversity of Single&#8208;Walled Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Nanotubes Grown via Template Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile strategy for the synthesis of inorganic nanotubes through template reactions is presented. The outer and inner walls of boron nitride nanotubes promote the coaxial growth of few&#8208;nanometers&#8208;wide chalcogenide nanotubes with diverse structures, including alloys and Janus configurations. The strategy enables the comprehensive exploration of various nanotubes, paving the way for their potential applications in optoelectronics.








Abstract
Monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are an ideal 2D platform for studying a wide variety of electronic properties and potential applications due to their chemical diversity. Similarly, single&#8208;walled TMD nanotubes (SW&#8208;TMDNTs)&#8212;seamless cylinders of rolled&#8208;up TMD monolayers&#8212;are 1D materials that can exhibit tunable electronic properties depending on both their chirality and composition. However, much less has been explored about their geometrical structures and chemical variations due to their instability under ambient conditions. Here, the structural diversity of SW&#8208;TMDNTs templated by boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) is reported. The outer surfaces and inner cavities of the BNNTs promote and stabilize the coaxial growth of SW&#8208;TMDNTs with various diameters, including few&#8208;nanometers&#8208;wide species. The chiral indices (n,m) of individual SW&#8208;MoS2NTs are assigned by high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy, and statistical analyses reveals a broad chirality distribution ranging from zigzag to armchair configurations. Furthermore, this methodology can be applied to the synthesis of various TMDNTs,&#160;such as selenides and alloyed Mo1&#8722;xWxS2. Comprehensive microscopic and spectroscopic analyses also suggest the partial formation of Janus MoS2(1&#8722;x)Se2x nanotubes. The BNNT&#8208;templated reaction provides a universal platform to characterize the chirality&#8208;dependent properties of 1D nanotubes with various electronic structures.

Virus&#8208;Based Pyroelectricity
Viruses lack the machinery to directly sense and respond to heat, but they can undergo structural adaptations in response to temperature changes. In article number 2305503, Seung&#8208;Wuk Lee and co&#8208;workers present the discovery of pyroelectric potential generation within a virus and delve into the intricate molecular mechanisms underpinning viral pyroelectricity using genetic engineering and Kelvin probe force microscopy techniques.

Treatment of Aneurysms
In article number 2305868, Rahmi Oklu and co&#8208;workers introduce an approach to flow diverter stent&#8208;assisted treatment of wide&#8208;neck ruptured aneurysms. Following the deployment of the stent, a microcatheter is trapped with its tip in the aneurysm sac. The biomaterial is injected, casting the aneurysm and instantly achieving hemostasis. After a short period of time, the aneurysm neck is healed, preventing re&#8208;bleeding.

         <title>Optical Enhancement of Indirect Bandgap 2D Transition Metal Dichalcogenides for Multi&#8208;Functional Optoelectronic Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modifications to improve the optical properties of devices based on indirect bandgap transition metal dichalcogenides and their emerging applications in optoelectronic sensors are the focus of this review. Various engineering techniques are discussed to overcome their limitations derived from the indirect bandgap of multilayer transition metal dichalcogenides as well as future directions of these materials for optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
The unique electrical and optical properties of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) make them attractive nanomaterials for optoelectronic applications, especially optical sensors. However, the optical characteristics of these materials are dependent on the number of layers. Monolayer TMDs have a direct bandgap that provides higher photoresponsivity compared to multilayer TMDs with an indirect bandgap. Nevertheless, multilayer TMDs are more appropriate for various photodetection applications due to their high carrier density, broad spectral response from UV to near&#8208;infrared, and ease of large&#8208;scale synthesis. Therefore, this review focuses on the modification of the optical properties of devices based on indirect bandgap TMDs and their emerging applications. Several successful developments in optical devices are examined, including band structure engineering, device structure optimization, and heterostructures. Furthermore, it introduces cutting&#8208;edge techniques and future directions for optoelectronic devices based on multilayer TMDs.

         <title>Recent Advances of Seed&#8208;Mediated Growth of Metal Nanoparticles: from Growth to Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art development in seeded growth methods from key influencing factors of growth and applications of grown metal nanoparticles are summarized in this review to highlight the achievements and help researchers understand the current investigation status of seed&#8208;mediated methods. Furthermore, the challenges faced by seed&#8208;mediated methods are outlined and the future directions for advancing seed&#8208;mediated methods are outlooked.








Abstract
Unprecedented advances in metal nanoparticle synthesis have paved the way for broad applications in sensing, imaging, catalysis, diagnosis, and therapy by tuning the optical properties, enhancing catalytic performance, and improving chemical and biological properties of metal nanoparticles. The central guiding concept for regulating the size and morphology of metal nanoparticles is identified as the precise manipulation of nucleation and subsequent growth, often known as seed&#8208;mediated growth methods. However, since the growth process is sensitive not only to the metal seeds but also to capping agents, metal precursors, growth solution, growth/incubation time, reductants, and other influencing factors, the precise control of metal nanoparticle morphology is multifactorial. Further, multiple reaction parameters are entangled with each other, so it is necessary to clarify the mechanism by which each factor precisely regulates the morphology of metal nanoparticles. In this review, to exploit the generality and extendibility of metal nanoparticle synthesis, the mechanisms of growth influencing factors in seed&#8208;mediated growth methods are&#160;systematically summarized. Second, a variety of critical properties and applications enabled by grown metal nanoparticles are focused upon. Finally, the current progress and offer insights on the challenges, opportunities, and future directions for the growth and applications of grown metal nanoparticles are reviewed.

         <title>The Synthescope: A Vision for Combining Synthesis with Atomic Fabrication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efforts toward atom&#8208;by&#8208;atom fabrication have gathered momentum. Recent results with electron&#8208;beam manipulation illustrate a significant advance toward atomic&#8208;scale patterning. In this work, the case is made that future efforts in this direction will benefit from reconceptualizing the scanning transmission electron microscope as a combined synthesis and manipulation platform, and simple strategies to incorporate synthesis processes with existing hardware are provided.








Abstract
The scanning transmission electron microscope, a workhorse instrument in materials characterization, is being transformed into an atomic&#8208;scale material&#8208;manipulation platform. With an eye on the trajectory of recent developments and the obstacles toward progress in this field, a vision for a path toward an expanded set of capabilities and applications is provided. The microscope is reconceptualized as an instrument for fabrication and synthesis with the capability to image and characterize atomic&#8208;scale structural formation as it occurs. Further development and refinement of this approach may have substantial impact on research in microelectronics, quantum information science, and catalysis, where precise control over atomic&#8208;scale structure and chemistry of a few &#8220;active sites&#8221; can have a dramatic impact on larger&#8208;scale functionality and where developing a better understanding of atomic&#8208;scale processes can help point the way to larger&#8208;scale synthesis approaches.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;II&#160;Fluorophore with Inverted Dependence of Fluorescence Quantum Yield on Polarity as Potent Phototheranostics for Fluorescence&#8208;Image&#8208;Guided Phototherapy of Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II fluorophore AS1 with inverted dependence of fluorescence quantum yield on polarity is used to construct potent phototheranostics (AS1R) for clear delineation and complete elimination of tumors by phototherapy with an ultralow injection dose. Compared with other types of organic phototheranostics, AS1R exhibits better phototheranostic performance in brightness, photothermal effect, and photodynamic performance at the same mass concentration.








Abstract
Organic phototheranostics simultaneously having fluorescence in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700&#160;nm) window, and photothermal and photodynamic functions possess great prospects in tumor diagnosis and therapy. However, such phototheranostics generally suffer from low brightness and poor photodynamic performance due to severe solvatochromism. Herein, an organic NIR&#8208;II fluorophore AS1, which possesses an inverted dependence of fluorescence quantum yield on polarity, is reported to serve as potent phototheranostics for tumor diagnosis and therapy. After encapsulation of AS1 into nanostructures, the obtained phototheranostics (AS1R) exhibit high extinction coefficients (e.g., 68200&#160;L&#160;mol&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;1 at 808&#160;nm), NIR&#8208;II emission with high fluorescence quantum yield up to 4.7% beyond 1000 nm, photothermal conversion efficiency of &#8776;65%, and 1O2 quantum yield up to 4.1%. The characterization of photophysical properties demonstrates that AS1R is superior to other types of organic phototheranostics in brightness, photothermal effect, and photodynamic performance at the same mass concentration. The excellent phototheranostic performance of AS1R enables clear visualization and complete elimination of tumors using a single and low injection dose. This study demonstrates the merits and prospects of NIR&#8208;II fluorophore with inverted polarity dependence of fluorescence quantum yield as high&#8208;performance phototheranostic agents for fluorescence imaging and phototherapy of tumors.

         <title>Hydrophobicity&#8208;Adaptive Polymers Trigger Fission of Tumor&#8208;Cell&#8208;Derived Microparticles for Enhanced Anticancer Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrophobicity&#8208;adaptive polymers based on poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) are anchored to tumor&#8208;cell&#8208;derived microparticles (MPs) for enhanced delivery of anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX). The hydrophobicity of polymers at the tumor acidic microenvironment drives the fission of MPs to form small vesicles, facilitating tumor accumulation, deep tumor penetration, and efficient internalization of DOX@MPs into tumor cells and cancer stem cells.








Abstract
Tumor&#8208;cell&#8208;derived microparticles (MPs) can function as anticancer drug&#8208;delivery carriers. However, short blood circulation time, large&#8208;size&#8208;induced insufficient tumor accumulation and penetration into tumor parenchyma, as well as limited cellular internalization by tumor cells and cancer stem cells (CSCs), and difficult intracellular drug release restrict the anticancer activity of tumor&#8208;cell&#8208;derived MP&#8208;based drug&#8208;delivery systems. In this work, hydrophobicity&#8208;adaptive polymers based on poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) are anchored to tumor&#8208;cell&#8208;derived MPs for enhanced delivery of the anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX). The polymers are hydrophilic in blood to prolong the circulation time of DOX&#8208;loaded MPs (DOX@MPs), while rapidly switching to hydrophobic at the tumor acidic microenvironment. The hydrophobicity of polymers drives the fission of tumor&#8208;cell&#8208;derived MPs to form small vesicles, facilitating tumor accumulation, deep tumor penetration, and efficient internalization of DOX@MPs into tumor cells and CSCs. Subsequently, the hydrophobicity of polymers in acidic lysosomes further promotes DOX release to nuclei for strong cytotoxicity against tumor cells and CSCs. The work provides a facile and simple strategy for improved anticancer drug delivery of tumor&#8208;cell&#8208;derived MPs.

Subsequently, the hydrophobicity of polymers in acidic lysosomes further promotes DOX release to nuclei for strong cytotoxicity against tumor cells and CSCs. The work provides a facile and simple strategy for improved anticancer drug delivery of tumor-cell-derived MPs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrastrong Ionotronic Films Showing Electrochemical Osmotic Actuation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrastrong nanocomposite is introduced, which is formed based on the two nanoscopic building blocks: large&#8208;size 2D MXene and 1D nanocellulose with very high aspect ratio. In the wet state, the hierarchical structures of the nanocomposite provide high ionotronic conductivity and enable out&#8208;of&#8208;plane actuation with reversible giant strain reaching 85% at only 1 V.








Abstract
A multifunctional soft material with high ionic and electrical conductivity, combined with high mechanical properties and the ability to change shape can enable bioinspired responsive devices and systems. The incorporation of all these characteristics in a single material is very challenging, as the improvement of one property tends to reduce other properties. Here, a nanocomposite film based on charged, high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio 1D flexible nanocellulose fibrils, and 2D Ti3C2Tx MXene is presented. The self&#8208;assembly process results in a stratified structure with the nanoparticles aligned in&#8208;plane, providing high ionotronic conductivity and mechanical strength, as well as large water uptake. In hydrogel form with 20&#160;wt% liquid, the electrical conductivity is over 200 S cm&#8722;1 and the in&#8208;plane tensile strength is close to 100&#160;MPa. This multifunctional performance results from the uniquely layered composite structure at nano&#8208; and mesoscales. A new type of electrical soft actuator is assembled where voltage as low as &#177;1&#160;V resulted in osmotic effects and giant reversible out&#8208;of&#8208;plane swelling, reaching 85% strain.

         <title>Bimodal Gating Mechanism in Hybrid Thin&#8208;Film Transistors Based on Dynamically Reconfigurable Nanoscale Biopolymer Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ability to control the deposition of nanoscale layers of silk on semiconductors allows transistors that can controllably operate either in the ionic or dielectric regime to be built. These devices can be produced at scale and allow for a class of hybrid, (bio)functional devices where semiconductors and natural materials coexist, reducing the gap between biology and technology even further.








Abstract
In recent years, increased control over naturally derived structural protein formulations and their self&#8208;assembly has enabled the application of high&#8208;resolution manufacturing techniques to silk&#8208;based materials, leading to bioactive interfaces with unprecedented miniaturized formats and functionalities. Here, a hybrid biopolymer&#8211;semiconductor device, obtained by integrating nanoscale silk layers in a well&#8208;established class of inorganic field&#8208;effect transistors (silk&#8208;FETs), is presented. The devices offer two distinct modes of operation&#8212;either traditional field&#8208;effect or electrolyte&#8208;gated&#8212;enabled by the precisely controlled thickness, morphology, and biochemistry of the integrated silk layers. The different operational modes are selectively accessed by dynamically modulating the free&#8208;water content within the nanoscale protein layer from the vapor phase. The utility of these hybrid devices is illustrated in a highly sensitive and ultrafast breath sensor, highlighting the opportunities offered by the integration of nanoscale biomaterial interfaces in conjunction with traditional semiconductor devices, enabling functional outcomes at the intersection between the worlds of microelectronics and biology.

         <title>DNA&#8208;Programmed Stem Cell Niches via Orthogonal Extracellular Vesicle&#8211;Cell Communications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA&#8208;encoded ligand&#8211;receptor system (DLRS) is developed to program orthogonal interkingdom EV&#8211;cell communications in complex environments. This system enables a DNA&#8208;programmed stem cell niche for stemness maintenance and self&#8208;renewal of female germline stem cells (FGSCs) without the need for living feeder cells.








Abstract
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are natural carriers for intercellular transfer of bioactive molecules, which are harnessed for wide biomedical applications. However, a facile yet general approach to engineering interspecies EV&#8211;cell communications is still lacking. Here, the use of DNA to encode the heterogeneous interfaces of EVs and cells in a manner free of covalent or genetic modifications is reported, which enables orthogonal EV&#8211;cell interkingdom interactions in complex environments. Cholesterol&#8208;modified DNA strands and tetrahedral DNA frameworks are employed with complementary sequences to serve as artificial ligands and receptors docking on EVs and living cells, respectively, which can mediate specific yet efficient cellular internalization of EVs via Watson&#8211;Crick base pairing. It is shown that based on this system, human cells can adopt EVs derived from the mouse, watermelon, and Escherichia coli. By implementing several EV&#8211;cell circuits, it shows that this DNA&#8208;programmed system allows orthogonal EV&#8211;cell communications in complex environments. This study further demonstrates efficient delivery of EVs with bioactive contents derived from feeder cells toward monkey female germline stem cells (FGSCs), which enables self&#8208;renewal and stemness maintenance of the FGSCs without feeder cells. This system may provide a universal platform to customize intercellular exchanges of materials and signals across species and kingdoms.

         <title>Giant Energy Density via Mechanically Tailored Relaxor Ferroelectric Behavior of PZT Thick Film</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanograin engineering of normal ferroelectrics beyond compositional modification, to simultaneously enhance the dielectric breakdown strength and polarization with slim hysteresis which is typical behavior of relaxor ferroelectrics (RFE), a facile approach, is designed and revealed for high&#8208;energy&#8208;storage devices. The mechanically transformed RFE thick film (&#8776;4&#160;&#181;m) delivers a record&#8208;high energy density of 124&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;3.








Abstract
Relaxor ferroelectrics (RFEs) are being actively investigated for energy&#8208;storage applications due to their large electric&#8208;field&#8208;induced polarization with slim hysteresis and fast energy charging&#8211;discharging capability. Here, a novel nanograin engineering approach based upon high kinetic energy deposition is reported, for mechanically inducing the RFE behavior in a normal ferroelectric Pb(Zr0.52Ti0.48)O3 (PZT), which results in simultaneous enhancement in the dielectric breakdown strength (EDBS) and polarization. Mechanically transformed relaxor thick films with 4&#160;&#181;m thickness exhibit an exceptional EDBS of 540&#160;MV&#160;m&#8722;1 and reduced hysteresis with large unsaturated polarization (103.6&#160;&#181;C&#160;cm&#8722;2), resulting in a record high energy&#8208;storage density of 124.1&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;3 and a power density of 64.5&#160;MW&#160;cm&#8722;3. This fundamental advancement is correlated with the generalized nanostructure design that comprises nanocrystalline phases embedded within the amorphous matrix. Microstructure&#8208;tailored ferroelectric behavior overcomes the limitations imposed by traditional compositional design methods and provides a feasible pathway for realization of high&#8208;performance energy&#8208;storage materials.

         <title>Exciton&#8208;Scissoring Perfluoroarenes Trigger Photomultiplication in Full Color Organic Image Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>

Covalent networks consisting of photo&#8208;crosslinked polymer donor:perfluoroarene exhibit exciton scissoring and subsequent electron trapping, leading to high EQE photomultiplication&#8208;type organic photodiodes together with enhanced stability and fine photo&#8208;patternability, without the use of conventional acceptor molecules. This mechanism is enabled by interfacial energy band bending between the perfluoroaryl group and polymer donor, as confirmed by photophysical analyses.








Abstract
An unprecedented but useful functionality of perfluoroarenes to enable exciton scissoring in photomultiplication&#8208;type organic photodiodes (PM&#8208;OPDs) is reported. Perfluoroarenes that are covalently connected to polymer donors via a photochemical reaction enable the demonstration of high external quantum efficiency and B&#8208;/G&#8208;/R&#8208;selective PM&#8208;OPDs without the use of conventional acceptor molecules. The operation mechanism of the suggested perfluoroarene&#8208;driven PM&#8208;OPDs, how covalently bonded polymer donor:perfluoroarene PM&#8208;OPDs can perform as effectively as polymer donor:fullerene blend&#8208;based PM&#8208;OPDs, is investigated. By employing a series of arenes and conducting steady&#8208;state/time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence and transient absorption spectroscopy analyses, it is found that interfacial band bending between the perfluoroaryl group and polymer donor is responsible for exciton scissoring and subsequent electron trapping, which induces photomultiplication. Owing to the acceptor&#8208;free and covalently interconnected photoactive layer in the suggested PM&#8208;OPDs, superior operational and thermal stabilities are observed. Finally, finely patterned B&#8208;/G&#8208;/R&#8208;selective PM&#8208;OPD arrays that enable the construction of highly sensitive passive matrix&#8208;type organic image sensors are demonstrated.

         <title>A 3D&#8208;Printed Ferromagnetic Liquid Crystal Elastomer with Programmed Dual&#8208;Anisotropy and Multi&#8208;Responsiveness</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ferromagnetic liquid crystal elastomer (magLCE) ink whose nematic order and magnetization can be independently programmed to be anisotropic via a customized 3D&#8208;printing platform is reported. The 3D&#8208;printed magLCE provides designable multimodal shape morphing under different stimuli, which is promising for wireless soft robots and intelligent devices.








Abstract
Liquid crystal elastomers (LCE) and magnetic soft materials are promising active materials in many emerging fields, such as soft robotics. Despite the high demand for developing active materials that combine the advantages of LCE and magnetic actuation, the lack of independent programming of the LCE nematic order and magnetization in a single material still hinders the desired multi&#8208;responsiveness. In this study, a ferromagnetic LCE (magLCE) ink with nematic order and magnetization is developed that can be independently programmed to be anisotropic, referred to as &#8220;dual anisotropy&#8221;, via a customized 3D&#8208;printing platform. The magLCE ink is fabricated by dispersing ferromagnetic microparticles in the LCE matrix, and a 3D&#8208;printing platform is created by integrating a magnet with 3&#8208;DoF motion into an extrusion&#8208;based 3D printer. In addition to magnetic fields, magLCEs can also be actuated by heating sources (either environmental heating or photo&#8208;heating of the embedded ferromagnetic microparticles) with a high energy density and tunable actuation temperature. A programmed magLCE strip robot is demonstrated with enhanced adaptability to complex environments (different terrains, magnetic fields, and temperatures) using a multi&#8208;actuation strategy. The magLCE also has potential applications in mechanical memory, as demonstrated by the multistable mechanical metastructure array with remote writability and stable memory.

         <title>Electrochemically Controlled Hydrogels with Electrotunable Permeability and Uniaxial Actuation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unique properties of hydrogels enable the design of life&#8208;like soft intelligent systems. This work demonstrates how the swelling of hydrogels from cellulose nanofibrils and carbon nanotubes can be electrochemically controlled to achieve electrochemical osmotic actuation. This new materials system paves the way for integrated actuation, sensing, and controlled permeation in electrotunable separation membranes or soft actuators.








Abstract
The unique properties of hydrogels enable the design of life&#8208;like soft intelligent systems. However, stimuli&#8208;responsive hydrogels still suffer from limited actuation control. Direct electronic control of electronically conductive hydrogels can solve this challenge and allow direct integration with modern electronic systems. An electrochemically controlled nanowire composite hydrogel with high in&#8208;plane conductivity that stimulates a uniaxial electrochemical osmotic expansion is demonstrated. This materials system allows precisely controlled shape&#8208;morphing at only &#8722;1&#160;V, where capacitive charging of the hydrogel bulk leads to a large uniaxial expansion of up to 300%, caused by the ingress of &#8776;700 water molecules per electron&#8211;ion pair. The material retains its state when turned off, which is ideal for electrotunable membranes as the inherent coupling between the expansion and mesoporosity enables electronic control of permeability for adaptive separation, fractionation, and distribution. Used as electrochemical osmotic hydrogel actuators, they achieve an electroactive pressure of up to 0.7&#160;MPa (1.4&#160;MPa vs dry) and a work density of &#8776;150&#160;kJ&#160;m&#8722;3 (2&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3&#160;vs dry). This new materials system paves the way to integrate actuation, sensing, and controlled permeation into advanced soft intelligent systems.

         <title>A Spidroin&#8208;Inspired Hierarchical&#8208;Structure Binder Achieves Highly Integrated Silicon&#8208;Based Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aqueous&#8211;oil binary solution&#8208;based blend (AOB) binder characterized by a spidroin&#8208;like hierarchical structure for tolerating huge volume change of silicon&#8208;based electrodes is reported. The AOB binder enables both high tensile strength and elasticity, and strong electrode adhesion, therefore apparently stabilizing the silicon&#8208;based electrode structure and rendering prolonged electrode cycle life.








Abstract
As a promising component for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;ion batteries, silicon&#8208;based electrodes have attracted increasing attention by virtue of their ultrahigh theoretical specific capacities. Nevertheless, fast capacity fading posed by tremendous silicon&#8208;based electrode volume changes during cycling remains a huge challenge before large&#8208;scale applications. In this work, an aqueous&#8211;oil binary solution based blend (AOB) binder characterized by a spidroin&#8208;like hierarchical structure for tolerating the huge volume changes of silicon&#8208;based electrodes is developed. In the AOB binder, the polymer, containing hydrophobic tetrazole groups, denoted as PPB, and the water&#8208;soluble amorphous poly(acrylic acid), mimick the &#946;&#8208;sheet and &#945;&#8208;helix structure of spidroin, respectively. Benefitting from such biomimetic design, the AOB binder enables both high tensile strength and elasticity, and strong electrode adhesion, therefore apparently stabilizing the silicon&#8208;based electrode structure and rendering prolonged electrode cycle life. Such a strategy endows 3.3 Ah soft package cells assembled with Si/C composite anode and NCM811 cathode with a discharge specific capacity of 2.92 Ah after 700 cycles. This work marks a milestone in developing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art silicon&#8208;based electrodes toward high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;battery applications.

         <title>Multifunctional Intelligent Wearable Devices Using Logical Circuits of Monolithic Gold Nanowires</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multifunctional intelligent wearable devices are developed using monolithically patterned gold nanowires for both signal monitoring and processing. The monolithically patterned gold nanowires enable robust interfaces, programmable sensors, on&#8208;demand heating systems, and strain&#8208;gated logical circuits. The multifunctional intelligent wearable devices can sensitively monitor strain and temperature changes with the heating system for various biomedical applications.








Abstract
Although multifunctional wearable devices have been widely investigated for healthcare systems, augmented/virtual realities, and telemedicines, there are few reports on multiple signal monitoring and logical signal processing by using one single nanomaterial without additional algorithms or rigid application&#8208;specific integrated circuit chips. Here, multifunctional intelligent wearable devices are developed using monolithically patterned gold nanowires for both signal monitoring and processing. Gold bulk&#160;and hollow nanowires&#160;show distinctive electrical properties with high chemical stability and high stretchability. In accordance, the monolithically patterned gold nanowires can be used to fabricate the robust interfaces, programmable sensors, on&#8208;demand heating systems, and strain&#8208;gated logical circuits.

&lt;p&gt;Multifunctional intelligent wearable devices are developed using monolithically patterned gold nanowires for both signal monitoring and processing. The monolithically patterned gold nanowires enable robust interfaces, programmable sensors, on-demand heating systems, and strain-gated logical circuits. The multifunctional intelligent wearable devices can sensitively monitor strain and temperature changes with the heating system for various biomedical applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although multifunctional wearable devices have been widely investigated for healthcare systems, augmented/virtual realities, and telemedicines, there are few reports on multiple signal monitoring and logical signal processing by using one single nanomaterial without additional algorithms or rigid application-specific integrated circuit chips. Here, multifunctional intelligent wearable devices are developed using monolithically patterned gold nanowires for both signal monitoring and processing. Gold bulk&#160;and hollow nanowires&#160;show distinctive electrical properties with high chemical stability and high stretchability. In accordance, the monolithically patterned gold nanowires can be used to fabricate the robust interfaces, programmable sensors, on-demand heating systems, and strain-gated logical circuits. The stretchable sensors show high sensitivity for strain and temperature changes on the skin. Furthermore, the micro-wrinkle structures of gold nanowires exhibit the negative gauge factor, which can be used for strain-gated logical circuits. Taken together, this multifunctional intelligent wearable device would be harnessed as a promising platform for futuristic electronic and biomedical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular&#8208;Additive&#8208;Assisted Tellurium Homogenization in ZnSeTe Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dependence on aqueous hydrohalic acids poses challenges when working with oxygen&#8208; and water&#8208;sensitive precursors, as seen in the synthesis of Te&#8208;alloyed ZnSe quantum dots. In this work, a safe and oxygen&#8208;free method is proposed to introduce anhydrous acids into the synthesis using benzenecarbonyl fluoride as a chemical additive. This method enables a controlled release of acid, resulting in a more uniform Te distribution within the ZnSeTe lattice.








Abstract
Addition of aqueous hydrohalic acids during the synthesis of colloidal quantum dots (QDs) is widely employed to achieve high&#8208;quality QDs. However, this reliance on the use of aqueous solutions is incompatible with oxygen&#8208; and water&#8208;sensitive precursors such as those used in the synthesis of Te&#8208;alloyed ZnSe QDs. Herein, it is shown that this incompatibility leads to phase segregation into Te&#8208;rich and Te&#8208;poor regions, causing spectral broadening and luminescence peak shifting under high laser irradiation and applied electrical bias. Here, a synthetic strategy to produce anhydrous&#8208;HF in situ by using benzenecarbonyl fluoride (BF) as a chemical additive is reported. Through in situ 19F NMR spectroscopy, it is found that BF reacts with surfactants in tandem, ultimately producing intermediary F&#183;&#183;&#183;H&#183;&#183;&#183;trioctylamine adducts. These act as a pseudo&#8208;HF source that releases anhydrous HF. The controlled release of HF during nucleation and growth steps homogenizes Te distribution in ZnSeTe lattice, leading to spectrally stable blue&#8208;emitting QDs under increasing laser flux from &#8776;3 &#181;W to &#8776;12 mW and applied bias from 2.6 to 10 V. Single&#8208;dot photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy and analyses of the absorption, PL and transient absorption spectra together with density functional theory point to the role of anhydrous HF as a Te homogenizer.

         <title>Oriented Perovskite Film from Laser Recrystallization in Magnetic Field</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;MAPLA&#8221; employs magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;assisted pulse laser annealing to control perovskite crystal orientation on substrates, enhancing crystal size, orientation, and stability. Magnetic nanoparticles guide orientational gathering into nanoclusters. Device performance improves with responsivity and detectivity increasing two times, and photocurrent three orders higher than pulsed laser annealing. MAPLA enhances stability by preventing Pb2+ reduction, making MAPLA promising for stable electro&#8208;optical thin films.








Abstract
The orientation of crystals on the substrate and the presence of defects are critical factors in electro&#8208;optic performance. However, technical approaches to guide the orientational crystallization of electro&#8208;optical thin films remain challenging. Here,&#160;a novel physical method called magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;assisted pulse laser annealing (MAPLA) for controlling the orientation of perovskite crystals on substrates is reported. By inducing laser recrystallization of perovskite crystals under a magnetic field and with magnetic nanoparticles, the optical and magnetic fields are found to guide the orientational gathering of perovskite units into nanoclusters, resulting in perovskite crystals with preferred lattice orientation in (110) and (220) perpendicular to the substrate. The perovskite crystals obtained by MAPLA exhibit significantly larger grain size and fewer defects compared to those from pulsed laser annealing (PLA) and traditional thermal annealing, resulting in improved carrier lifetime and mobility. Furthermore, MAPLA demonstrates enhanced device performance, increasing responsivity and detectivity by two times, and photocurrent by nearly three orders compared with PLA. The introduction of Fe2O3 nanoparticles during MAPLA not only improves crystal size and orientation but also significantly enhances long&#8208;term stability by preventing Pb2+ reduction. The MAPLA method has great potential for fabricating many electro&#8208;optical thin films with desired device properties and stability.

         <title>Efficient and Bright Organic Radical Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Low Efficiency Roll&#8208;Off</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simultaneous achievement of high efficiency (&gt;17%) and radiance (&gt;1.0 &#215; 105 mW sr&#8722;1 m&#8722;2) for near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission is demonstrated based on doublet fluorescence with the combination of a bipolar host and a novel organic radical. Photophysical studies and device characterization support the substantial enhancement of device performance for doublet electroluminescence.








Abstract
Organic radicals have been of interest due to their potential to replace nonradical&#8208;based organic emitters, especially for deep&#8208;red/near&#8208;infrared (NIR) electroluminescence (EL), based on the spin&#8208;allowed doublet fluorescence. However, the performance of the radical&#8208;based EL devices is limited by low carrier mobility which causes a large efficiency roll&#8208;off at high current densities. Here, highly efficient and bright doublet EL devices are reported by combining a thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) host that supports both electron and hole transport and a tris(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl)methyl&#8208;based radical emitter. Steady&#8208;state and transient photophysical studies reveal the optical signatures of doublet luminescence mechanisms arising from both host and guest photoexcitation. The host system presented here allows balanced hole and electron currents, and a high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 17.4% at 707&#160;nm peak emission with substantially improved efficiency roll&#8208;off is reported: over 70% of the maximum EQE (12.2%) is recorded at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, and even at 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, nearly 50% of the maximum EQE (8.4%) is maintained. This is an important step in the practical application of organic radicals to NIR light&#8208;emitting devices.

         <title>Confining Prepared Ultrasmall Nanozymes Loading ATO for Lung Cancer Catalytic Therapy/Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrasmall nPt nanozymes are innovatively fabricated upon AuP via a SiO2 spatial confinement strategy, and then modified with human serum albumin, followed by loading&#160;atovaquone molecules, and encapsulating IR780 in succession, to design AP&#8208;HAI probes in which the IR780's PDT property and the nPt nanozymes' photoenhanced peroxidase&#8208;like ability endow probes with a high reactive oxygen species (ROS) productivity, which results in outstanding lung&#8208;cancer synergetic catalytic therapy/immunogenic&#8208;cell&#8208;death&#8208;based immunotherapy.








Abstract
Nanozymes with inherent enzyme&#8208;mimicking catalytic properties combat malignant tumor progression via catalytic therapy, while the therapeutic efficacy still needs to be improved. In this work, ultrasmall platinum nanozymes (nPt) in a confined domain of a wormlike pore channel in gold nanobipyramidal&#8211;mesoporous silica dioxide nanocomposites, producing nanozyme carriers AP&#8208;mSi with photoenhanced peroxidase ability, are innovatively synthesized. Afterward, based on the prepared AP&#8208;mSi, a lung&#8208;cancer nanozymes probe (AP&#8208;HAI) is ingeniously produced by removing the SiO2 template, modifying human serum albumin, and loading atovaquone molecules (ATO) as well as IR780. Under NIR light irradiation, inner AuP and IR780 collaborate for photothermal process, thus facilitating the peroxidase&#8208;like catalytic process of H2O2. Additionally, loaded ATO, a cell respiration inhibitor, can impair tumor respiration metabolism and cause oxygen retention, hence enhancing IR780's photodynamic therapy (PDT) effectiveness. As a result, IR780's PDT and nPt nanozymes' photoenhanced peroxidase&#8208;like ability endow probes a high ROS productivity, eliciting antitumor immune responses to destroy tumor tissue. Systematic studies reveal that the obvious reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation is obtained by the strategy of using nPt nanozymes and reducing oxygen consumption by ATO, which in turn enables lung&#8208;cancer synergetic catalytic therapy/immunogenic&#8208;cell&#8208;death&#8208;based immunotherapy. The results of this work would provide theoretical justification for the practical use of photoenhanced nanozyme probes.

Afterward, based on the prepared AP-mSi, a lung-cancer nanozymes probe (AP-HAI) is ingeniously produced by removing the SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; template, modifying human serum albumin, and loading atovaquone molecules (ATO) as well as IR780. Under NIR light irradiation, inner AuP and IR780 collaborate for photothermal process, thus facilitating the peroxidase-like catalytic process of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Additionally, loaded ATO, a cell respiration inhibitor, can impair tumor respiration metabolism and cause oxygen retention, hence enhancing IR780's photodynamic therapy (PDT) effectiveness. As a result, IR780's PDT and nPt nanozymes' photoenhanced peroxidase-like ability endow probes a high ROS productivity, eliciting antitumor immune responses to destroy tumor tissue. Systematic studies reveal that the obvious reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation is obtained by the strategy of using nPt nanozymes and reducing oxygen consumption by ATO, which in turn enables lung-cancer synergetic catalytic therapy/immunogenic-cell-death-based immunotherapy. The results of this work would provide theoretical justification for the practical use of photoenhanced nanozyme probes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Carrageenan as a Sacrificial Binder for 5&#160;V LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 Cathodes in Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>

&#955;&#8208;Carrageenan (CRN) is introduced as a &#8220;sacrificial&#8221; binder to produce a desired LiSOxF&#8208;rich cathode&#8211;electrolyte interphase on 5 V&#8208;class LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 from its innate sulfate functionality. CRN also protects the cathode surface from indiscriminate side reactions by its uniform coverage involving hydrogen bonding and ion&#8208;dipole interaction, thereby catching two challenging rabbits of stable cyclability and high&#8208;rate performance simultaneously.








Abstract
5&#160;V&#8208;class LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO) with its spinel symmetry is a promising cathode material for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the high&#8208;voltage operation of LNMO renders it vulnerable to interfacial degradation involving electrolyte decomposition, which hinders long&#8208;term and high&#8208;rate cycling. Herein, this longstanding challenge presented by LNMO is overcome by incorporating a sacrificial binder, namely, &#955;&#8208;carrageenan (CRN), a sulfated polysaccharide. This binder not only uniformly covers the LNMO surface via hydrogen bonding and ion&#8208;dipole interaction but also offers an ionically conductive cathode&#8211;electrolyte interphase layer containing LiSOxF, a product of the electrochemical decomposition of the sulfate group. Taking advantage of these two auspicious properties, the CRN&#8208;based electrode exhibits cycling and rate performance far superior to that of its counterparts based on the conventional poly(vinylidene difluoride) and sodium alginate binders. This study introduces a new concept, namely &#8220;sacrificial&#8221; binder, for battery electrodes known to deliver superior electrochemical performance but be adversely affected by interfacial instability.

         <title>An In Vivo Self&#8208;Assembled Bispecific Nanoblocker for Enhancing Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A peptide&#8208;based bispecific nanoblocker strategy is developed for in situ construction of CXCR4/PD&#8208;L1 targeted nanoclusters on the surface of tumor cells, which enables boosted T&#8208;cells infiltration by CXCR4 blockage and enhanced T&#8208;cells activation by PD&#8208;L1 occupancy, ultimately realizing high&#8208;performance tumor immunotherapy.








Abstract
Anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 monoclonal antibody has achieved substantial success in tumor immunotherapy by T&#8208;cells activation. However, the excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix components induced by unsatisfactory T&#8208;cells infiltration and poor tumor penetration of antibodies make it challenging to realize efficient tumor immunotherapy. Herein, a peptide&#8208;based bispecific nanoblocker (BNB) strategy is reported for in situ construction of CXCR4/PD&#8208;L1 targeted nanoclusters on the surface of tumor cells that are capable of boosting T&#8208;cells infiltration through CXCR4 blockage and enhancing T&#8208;cells activation by PD&#8208;L1 occupancy, ultimately realizing high&#8208;performance tumor immunotherapy. Briefly, the BNB strategy selectively recognizes and bonds CXCR4/PD&#8208;L1 with deep tumor penetration, which rapidly self&#8208;assembles into nanoclusters on the surface of tumor cells. Compared to the traditional bispecific antibody, BNB exhibits an intriguing metabolic behavior, that is, the elimination half&#8208;life (t1/2) of BNB in the tumor is 69.3&#160;h which is &#8776;50 times longer than that in the plasma (1.4&#160;h). The higher tumor accumulation and rapid systemic clearance overcome potential systemic side effects. Moreover, the solid tumor stress generated by excessive extracellular matrix components is substantially reduced to 44%, which promotes T&#8208;cells infiltration and activation for immunotherapy efficacy. Finally, these findings substantially strengthen and extend clinical applications of PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 immunotherapy.

         <dc:description>
A small&#8208;size aromatic amino acid of tryptophan (TRP), featuring strong cation&#8211;&#960; interactions, is introduced to "clean" the imperfect surface sites of the CsPb(Br/I)3 perovskite nanocrystals (NCs). The as&#8208;formed TRP&#8208;NCs demonstrate increased luminescence efficiency and obviously enhanced spectral stability, which enables the achievement of Rec.2020 pure&#8208;red perovskite&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes exhibiting high external quantum efficiency along with superior brightness and spectral stability.








Abstract
Achieving high&#8208;performance perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) with pure&#8208;red electroluminescence for practical applications remains a critical challenge because of the problematic luminescence property and spectral instability of existing emitters. Herein, high&#8208;efficiency Rec. 2020 pure&#8208;red PeLEDs, simultaneously exhibiting exceptional brightness and spectral stability, based on CsPb(Br/I)3 perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) capping with aromatic amino acid ligands featuring cation&#8211;&#960; interactions, are reported. It is proven that strong cation&#8211;&#960; interactions between the PbI6&#8208;octahedra of perovskite units and the electron&#8208;rich indole ring of tryptophan (TRP) molecules not only chemically polish the imperfect surface sites, but also markedly increase the binding affinity of the ligand molecules, leading to high photoluminescence quantum yields and greatly enhanced spectral stability of the CsPb(Br/I)3 NCs. Moreover, the incorporation of small&#8208;size aromatic TRP ligands ensures superior charge&#8208;transport properties of the assembled emissive layers. The resultant devices emitting at around 635&#160;nm demonstrate a champion external quantum efficiency of 22.8%, a max luminance of 12&#8239;910&#160;cd m&#8722;2, and outstanding spectral stability, representing one of the best&#8208;performing Rec. 2020 pure&#8208;red PeLEDs achieved so far.

         <title>Boosting the Electrochemical 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural Oxidation by Balancing the Competitive Adsorption of Organic and OH&#8722; over Controllable Reconstructed Ni3S2/NiOx</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of Ni3S2/NiOx&#8208;n with continuously controllable surface compositions is synthesized using a novel in situ controlled surface reconstruction strategy. Owing to the balanced competitive adsorption of 5&#8208;hyfroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and OH&#8722;, the optimized Ni3S2/NiOx&#8208;15 catalyst exhibits excellent performance inHMF electrooxidation, with a current density of 366&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 1.5&#160;V and selectivity of &gt;98% for the 2,5&#8208;furanedicarboxylic acid.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is a promising method for the efficient production of biomass&#8208;derived high&#8208;value&#8208;added chemicals. However, its practical application is limited by: 1) the low activity and selectivity caused by the competitive adsorption of HMF and OH&#8722; and 2) the low operational stability caused by the uncontrollable reconstruction of the catalyst. To overcome these limitations, a series of Ni3S2/NiOx&#8208;n catalysts with controllable compositions and well&#8208;defined structures are synthesized using a novel in situ controlled surface reconstruction strategy. The adsorption behavior of HMF and OH&#8722; can be continuously adjusted by varying the ratio of NiOx to Ni3S2 on the catalysts surface, as indicated by in situ characterizations, contact angle analysis,&#160;and theoretical simulations. Owing to the balanced competitive adsorption of HMF and OH&#8722;, the optimized Ni3S2/NiOx&#8208;15 catalyst exhibited remarkable HMF electrocatalytic oxidation performance, with the current density reaching 366&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 1.5&#160;VRHE and the Faradaic efficiency of the product, 2,5&#8208;furanedicarboxylic acid, reaching 98%. Moreover, Ni3S2/NiOx&#8208;15 exhibits excellent durability, with its activity and structure remaining stable for over 100&#160;h of operation. This study provides a new route for the design and construction of catalysts for value&#8208;added biomass conversion and offers new insights into enhancing catalytic performance by balancing competitive adsorption.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electrocatalytic oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is a promising method for the efficient production of biomass-derived high-value-added chemicals. However, its practical application is limited by: 1) the low activity and selectivity caused by the competitive adsorption of HMF and OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and 2) the low operational stability caused by the uncontrollable reconstruction of the catalyst. To overcome these limitations, a series of Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/NiO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; catalysts with controllable compositions and well-defined structures are synthesized using a novel in situ controlled surface reconstruction strategy. The adsorption behavior of HMF and OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; can be continuously adjusted by varying the ratio of NiO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; to Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on the catalysts surface, as indicated by in situ characterizations, contact angle analysis,&#160;and theoretical simulations. Owing to the balanced competitive adsorption of HMF and OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, the optimized Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/NiO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;-15 catalyst exhibited remarkable HMF electrocatalytic oxidation performance, with the current density reaching 366&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 1.5&#160;V&lt;sub&gt;RHE&lt;/sub&gt; and the Faradaic efficiency of the product, 2,5-furanedicarboxylic acid, reaching 98%. Moreover, Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/NiO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;-15 exhibits excellent durability, with its activity and structure remaining stable for over 100&#160;h of operation. This study provides a new route for the design and construction of catalysts for value-added biomass conversion and offers new insights into enhancing catalytic performance by balancing competitive adsorption.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Mitochondrion&#8208;Inspired Magnesium&#8211;Oxygen Biobattery with High Energy Density In Vivo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel magnesium&#8211;oxygen biobattery with a double&#8208;membrane structure, inspired by the mitochondrion, is presented. The biobattery exhibits an unprecedented volumetric energy density of 2517 Wh&#160;L&#8211;1 based on the overall volume of the device in vivo. It also shows excellent biocompatibility, with high device/tissue affinity.








Abstract
Implantable batteries are urgently needed as a power source to meet the demands of the next generation of biomedical electronic devices. However, existing implantable batteries suffer from unsatisfactory energy density, hindering the miniaturization of these devices. Here, a mitochondrion&#8208;inspired magnesium&#8211;oxygen biobattery that achieves both high energy density and biocompatibility in vivo is reported. The resulting biobattery exhibits a recorded energy density of 2517 Wh&#160;L&#8211;1/1491 Wh&#160;kg&#8211;1 based on the total volume/mass of the device in vivo, which is &#8776;2.5 times higher than the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art, and can adapt to different environments for stable discharges. The volume of the magnesium&#8211;oxygen biobattery can be as thin as 0.015 mm3 and can be scaled up to 400 times larger without reducing the energy density. Additionally, it shows a stable biobattery/tissue interface, significantly reducing foreign body reactions. This work presents an effective strategy for the development of high&#8208;performance implantable batteries.

         <title>Rational Design of a Chemical Bath Deposition Based Tin Oxide Electron&#8208;Transport Layer for Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel tin oxide electron&#8208;transport layer for perovskite solar cells is developed via chemical bath deposition. Oxalic acid, a volatile dicarboxylic acid ligand, functions as a chemical linker to facilitate film deposition and can be readily removed by thermal annealing and a mild H2O2 treatment. The result is an efficient (24.6%) and stable (T85 = 1500&#160;h) perovskite solar cell.








Abstract
Chemical bath deposition (CBD) is widely used to deposit tin oxide (SnOx) as an electron&#8208;transport layer in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The conventional recipe uses thioglycolic acid (TGA) to facilitate attachments of SnOx particles onto the substrate. However, nonvolatile TGA is reported to harm the operational stability of PSCs. In this work, a volatile oxalic acid (OA) is introduced as an alternative to TGA. OA, a dicarboxylic acid, functions as a chemical linker for the nucleation and attachment of particles to the substrate in the chemical bath. Moreover, OA can be readily removed through thermal annealing followed by a mild H2O2 treatment, as shown by FTIR measurements. Synergistically, the mild H2O2 treatment selectively oxidizes the surface of the SnOx layer, minimizing nonradiative interface carrier recombination. EELS (electron&#8208;energy&#8208;loss spectroscopy) confirms that the SnOx surface is dominated by Sn4+, while the bulk is a mixture of Sn2+ and Sn4+. This rational design of a CBD SnOx layer leads to devices with T85 &#8776;1500&#160;h, a significant improvement over the TGA&#8208;based device with T80 &#8776;250&#160;h. The champion device reached a power conversion efficiency of 24.6%. This work offers a rationale for optimizing the complex parameter space of CBD SnOx to achieve efficient and stable PSCs.

         <title>Fruit&#8208;Derived Extracellular&#8208;Vesicle&#8208;Engineered Structural Droplet Drugs for Enhanced Glioblastoma Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fruit&#8208;derived extracellular vesicle (EV)&#8208;engineered structural droplet drugs (ESDDs) exhibit excellent stability and flexibility, enabling them to highly efficiently cross the blood&#8211;brain barrier/blood&#8211;brain tumor barrier (BBB/BBTB) and deeply penetrate into glioblastoma tissues by deformation&#8208;amplified endocytosis and membrane fusion. As expected, the ESDDs present more efficient capacities than cRGD&#8208;modified EVs (REs) in accumulation, deep penetration, and cellular internalization, significantly enhancing the anti&#8208;glioblastoma efficacy.








Abstract
Existing solid&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;based drug delivery systems remain a great challenge for glioblastoma chemotherapy due to their poor capacities in crossing the blood&#8211;brain barrier/blood&#8211;brain tumor barrier (BBB/BBTB). Herein, fruit&#8208;derived extracellular&#8208;vesicle (EV)&#8208;engineered structural droplet drugs (ESDDs) are demonstrated by programming the self&#8208;assembly of fruit&#8208;derived EVs at the DOX@squalene&#8211;PBS interface, greatly enhancing the antitumor efficacy against glioblastoma. The ESDDs experience a flexible delivery via deformation&#8208;amplified macropinocytosis and membrane fusion, enabling them to highly efficiently cross the BBB/BBTB and deeply penetrate glioblastoma tissues. As expected, the ESDDs exhibit approximately 2.5&#8208;fold intracellular uptake, 2.2&#8208;fold transcytosis, and fivefold membrane fusion higher than cRGD&#8208;modified EVs (REs), allowing highly efficient accumulation, deep penetration, and cellular internalization into the glioblastoma tissues, and thereby significantly extending the survival time of glioblastoma mice.

LiBH4 is a promising solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SE) due to its thermodynamic stability to Li. However, poor Li&#8208;ion conductivities at room temperature, low oxidative stabilities, and severe dendrite growth hamper its application. In this work, a partial dehydrogenation strategy is adopted to in situ generate an electronic blocking layer dispersed of LiH, addressing the above three issues simultaneously. The electrically insulated LiH reduces the electronic conductivity by two orders of magnitude, leading to a 32.0&#8208;times higher critical electrical bias for dendrite growth on the particle surfaces than that of the counterpart. Additionally, this layer not only promotes the Li&#8208;ion conductance by stimulating coordinated rotations of BH4&#8722; and B12H122&#8722;, contributing to a Li&#8208;ion conductivity of 1.38 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 at 25 &#176;C, but also greatly enhances oxidation stability by localizing the electron density on BH4&#8722;, extending its voltage window to 6.0&#160;V. Consequently, this electrolyte exhibits an unprecedented critical current density (CCD) of 15.12&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 25 &#176;C, long&#8208;term Li plating and stripping stability for 2700&#160;h, and a wide temperature window for dendrite inhibition from &#8722;30 to 150 &#176;C. Its Li&#8208;LiCoO2 cell displays high reversibility within 3.0&#8211;5.0&#160;V. It is believed that this work provides a clear direction for solid&#8208;state hydride electrolytes.

         <title>Scalable All&#8208;Inorganic Halide Perovskite Photoanodes with &gt;100&#160;h Operational Stability Containing Earth&#8208;Abundant Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A critical challenge for the application of perovskite photoelectrodes for solar fuels and feedstock generation is to overcome their instability in aqueous media and the use of expensive materials. In this work, a CsPbBr3 photoanode is presented that contains solely earth&#8208;abundant materials and reaches over 100&#160;h operational stability, which can be easily extended to weeks.








Abstract
The application of halide perovskites in the photoelectrochemical generation of solar fuels and feedstocks is hindered by the instability of perovskites in aqueous electrolytes and the use of expensive electrode and catalyst materials, particularly in photoanodes driving kinetically slow water oxidation. Here, solely earth&#8208;abundant materials are incorporated to fabricate a CsPbBr3&#8208;based photoanode that reaches a low onset potential of +0.4 VRHE and 8&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 photocurrent density at +1.23 VRHE for water oxidation, close to the radiative efficiency limit of CsPbBr3. This photoanode retains 100% of its stabilized photocurrent density for more than 100&#160;h of operation by replacing once the inexpensive graphite sheet upon signs of deterioration. The improved performance is due to an efficiently electrodeposited NiFeOOH catalyst on a protective self&#8208;adhesive graphite sheet, and enhanced charge transfer achieved by phase engineering of CsPbBr3. Devices with &gt;1 cm2 area, and low&#8208;temperature processing demonstrate the potential for low capital cost, stable, and scalable perovskite photoanodes.

         <title>Enhancing Oxygen Evolution Reaction Performance in Prussian Blue Analogues: Triple&#8208;Play of Metal Exsolution, Hollow Interiors, and Anionic Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchical hollow core&#8211;shell FeMn@CoNi&#8211;Se PBA materials with metallic Ni NPs loading can be synthesized via low&#8208;temperature thermal treatment. The prepared PBA&#8208;Se 350 displays outstanding catalytic performance and stability toward the oxygen evolution reaction in an alkaline solution, superior to commercial catalysts.








Abstract
Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) are promising catalysts for green hydrogen production. However, the rational design of high&#8208;performing PBAs is challenging, which requires an in&#8208;depth understanding of the catalytic mechanism. Here FeMn@CoNi core&#8211;shell PBAs are employed as precursors, together with Se powders, in low&#8208;temperature pyrolysis in an argon atmosphere. This synthesis method enables the partial dissociation of inner FeMn PBAs that results in hollow interiors, Ni nanoparticles (NPs) exsolution to the surface, and Se incorporation onto the PBA shell. The resulting material presents ultralow oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotential (184&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) and low Tafel slope (43.4&#160;mV dec&#8722;1), outperforming leading&#8208;edge PBA&#8208;based electrocatalysts. The mechanism responsible for such a high OER activity is revealed, assisted by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and the surface examination before and after the OER process.&#160;The exsolved Ni NPs are found to help turn the PBAs into Se&#8208;doped core&#8211;shell metal oxyhydroxides during the OER, in which the heterojunction with Ni and the Se incorporation are combined to improve the OER kinetics. This work shows that efficient OER catalysts could be developed by using a novel synthesis method backed up by a sound understanding and control of the catalytic pathway.

         <title>Ultrarapid&#8208;Acting Microneedles for Immediate Delivery of Biotherapeutics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrarapid&#8208;acting microneedle (URA&#8208;MN) patch to realize immediate delivery of biotherapeutics with negligible residuals in tissue is presented. In this design, accelerated drug release is achieved by incorporating effervescent agents into the needle tip. The rapid release, easy administration, and excellent biocompatibility of URA&#8208;MN are well demonstrated in three different mouse models.








Abstract
Subcutaneous (SC) injection is a common administration route for rapid and efficient delivery of biotherapeutics. However, syringe&#8208;based injections usually require professional assistance and are associated with pain and potential risks of infections, thus leading to undesired patient compliance and poor life quality. Herein, this work presents an ultrarapid&#8208;acting microneedle (URA&#8208;MN) patch for immediate transdermal delivery of therapeutics in a minimally invasive manner. Effervescent agents are incorporated into the tip of URA&#8208;MN for rapid generation of CO2 bubbles upon insertion into the skin, immediately powering the biotherapeutics release within a few minutes. The release kinetics of diverse agents including liraglutide (LRT), insulin, and heparin from the URA&#8208;MN patches are evaluated in three different mouse models, and the rapid release of biotherapeutics and potent therapeutic effects are achieved with only 5 min administration. Noteworthily, attributed to the short application duration and negligible residuals of MN matrix remaining in the skin, the URA&#8208;MN patch shows desirable biocompatibility after six&#8208;week administration.

         <title>Fused&#8208;Ring Electron&#8208;Acceptor Single Crystals with Chiral 2D Supramolecular Organization for Anisotropic Chiral Optoelectronic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing chiral centers into the fused&#8208;ring electron acceptor BTP&#8208;4F yields an intriguing 2D supramolecular organization consisting of intertwined, oppositely helical molecules, in which the intermolecular chiral exciton coupling is responsible for the chirality at the supramolecular level. A significant current dissymmetry factor exceeding &#8722;1.4 is achieved, whose amplified, inverted, and anisotropic current dissymmetry is revealed by the finite element simulations.








Abstract
Supramolecular chiral organization gives &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules access to fascinating specific interactions with circularly polarized light (CPL). Such a feature enables the fabrication of high&#8208;performance chiral organic electronic devices that detect or emit CPL directly.

&lt;p&gt;Introducing chiral centers into the fused-ring electron acceptor BTP-4F yields an intriguing 2D supramolecular organization consisting of intertwined, oppositely helical molecules, in which the intermolecular chiral exciton coupling is responsible for the chirality at the supramolecular level. A significant current dissymmetry factor exceeding &#8722;1.4 is achieved, whose amplified, inverted, and anisotropic current dissymmetry is revealed by the finite element simulations.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supramolecular chiral organization gives &lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;-conjugated molecules access to fascinating specific interactions with circularly polarized light (CPL). Such a feature enables the fabrication of high-performance chiral organic electronic devices that detect or emit CPL directly. Herein, it is shown that chiral fused-ring electron-acceptor BTP-4F single-crystal-based phototransistors demonstrate distinguished CPL discrimination capability with current dissymmetry factor exceeding 1.4, one of the highest values among state-of-the-art direct CPL detectors. Theoretical calculations prove that the chirality at the supramolecular level in these enantiomeric single crystals originates from chiral exciton coupling of a unique quasi-2D&#160;supramolecular organization consisting of interlaced molecules with opposite helical conformation. Impressively, such supramolecular organization produces a higher dissymmetry factor along the preferred growth direction of the chiral single crystals in comparison to that of the short axis direction. Furthermore, the amplified, inverted, and also anisotropic current dissymmetry compared to optical dissymmetry is studied by finite element simulations. Therefore, a unique chiral supramolecular organization that is responsible for the excellent chiroptical response and anisotropic electronic properties is developed, which not only enables the construction of high-performance CPL detection devices but also allows a better understanding of the structure&#8211;property relationships in chiral organic optoelectronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Breath Biopsy Reveals Systemic Immunothrombosis and Its Resolution through Bioorthogonal Dendritic Nanoprobes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Detection of immunothrombosis is an unmet medical need as it relates to prevalent and life&#8208;threatening conditions, including severe COVID&#8208;19&#160;and sepsis. A novel thrombin&#8208;sensitive nanoprobe releases a volatile reporter molecule, when in contact with thrombin. The volatile reporter exits the circulation in the lungs. Analysis of the exhaled breath provides unprecedented quantitative knowledge of thrombin activity in vivo.








Abstract
Immunothrombosis, an inflammation&#8208;dependent activation of the coagulation cascade, leads to microthrombi formations in small vessels. It is a dreaded complication of COVID&#8208;19&#160;and a major cause of respiratory failure. Due to their size and disseminated nature, microthrombi are currently undetectable. Here, noninvasive detection of a volatile reporter in the exhaled air is introduced for assessment of systemic immunothrombosis. A dendritic nanoprobe, containing high loading of a thrombin&#8208;sensitive substrate, is selectively cleaved by thrombin, resulting in release of a synthetic bioorthogonal volatile organic compound (VOC). The VOC is quantitated in the exhaled air biopsies via gas chromatography&#8211;mass spectrometry (GC&#8211;MS), allowing near real&#8208;time assessment of systemic immunothrombosis. The VOC detection can be further improved with more rapid and sensitive MS&#8208;based technologies. The amount of the VOC in the exhaled air decreases with resolution of the microvascular inflammation and intravascular fibrin depositions. Through conjugation of the thrombin&#8208;sensitive peptide with a rhodol derivative, a novel thrombin&#8208;sensitive fluorescent nanoprobe is developed for intravital visualization of thrombin activity in actively growing thrombi. These results establish unprecedented detection of thrombin activity in vivo, addressing this unmet medical need. This novel approach facilitates diagnosis of immunothrombosis in diseases such as diabetic complications, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and COVID&#8208;19.

         <title>Spin&#8211;Orbit Torques and Spin Hall Magnetoresistance Generated by Twin&#8208;Free and Amorphous Bi0.9Sb0.1 Topological Insulator Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bi1&#8722;xSbx is a topological insulator with promising applications in spintronics and highly debated charge&#8211;spin conversion properties. Measurements of magnetoresistance and current&#8208;induced spin&#8211;orbit torques in Bi0.9Sb0.1/FeCo bilayers establish an isotropic charge&#8211;spin conversion efficiency of 1 in twin&#8208;free crystalline Bi0.9Sb0.1 and 0.1 in amorphous Bi0.9Sb0.1. Depending on temperature, thermally excited bulk carriers and the isotropic surface states contribute to the torques in crystalline Bi0.9Sb0.1. &#160;








Abstract
Topological insulators have attracted great interest as generators of spin&#8211;orbit torques (SOTs) in spintronic devices. Bi1&#8722;xSbx is a prominent topological insulator that has a high charge&#8208;to&#8208;spin conversion efficiency. However, the origin and magnitude of the SOTs induced by current&#8208;injection in Bi1&#8722;xSbx remain controversial. Here, the investigation of the SOTs and spin Hall magnetoresistance resulting from charge&#8208;to&#8208;spin conversion in twin&#8208;free epitaxial layers of Bi0.9Sb0.1(0001) coupled to FeCo are investigated, and compared with those of amorphous Bi0.9Sb0.1. A large charge&#8208;to&#8208;spin conversion efficiency of 1 in the first case and less than 0.1 in the second is found, confirming crystalline Bi0.9Sb0.1 as a strong spin&#8208;injector material. The SOTs and spin Hall magnetoresistance are independent of the direction of the electric current, indicating that charge&#8208;to&#8208;spin conversion in single&#8208;crystal Bi0.9Sb0.1(0001) is isotropic despite the strong anisotropy of the topological surface states. Further, it is found that the damping&#8208;like SOT has a non&#8208;monotonic temperature dependence with a minimum at 20&#160;K. By correlating the SOT with resistivity and weak antilocalization measurements, charge&#8211;spin conversion is concluded to occur via thermally excited holes from the bulk states above 20&#160;K, and conduction through the isotropic surface states with increasing spin polarization due to decreasing electron&#8211;electron scattering below&#160;20&#160;K.

         <title>Enabling Scalable Polymer Electrolyte with Dual&#8208;Reinforced Stable Interface for 4.5&#160;V Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel polymer electrolyte (F&amp;NPE) is developed to construct dual&#8208;reinforced stable interfaces, which can effectively suppress interfacial parasitic reactions and structural degradation of Ni&#8208;rich cathode materials. Meanwhile, a unique two&#8208;stage rheology&#8208;tuning UV polymerization strategy promising for continuous scalable fabrication is utilized. 4.5&#160;V NCM622//Li batteries achieve excellent long&#8208;term cyclability even with high cathode loading and thin Li.








Abstract
Hitherto, it remains a great challenge to stabilize electrolyte&#8211;electrode interfaces and impede lithium dendrite proliferation in lithium&#8208;metal batteries with high&#8208;capacity nickel&#8208;rich LiNxCoyMn1&#8722;x&#8722;yO2 (NCM) layer cathodes. Herein, a special molecular&#8208;level&#8208;designed polymer electrolyte is prepared by the copolymerization of hexafluorobutyl acrylate and methylene bisacrylamide to construct dual&#8208;reinforced stable interfaces. Verified by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy depth profiling, there are favorable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers on Li metal anodes and robust cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) on Ni&#8208;rich cathodes. The SEI enriched in lithiophilic N&#8722;(C)3 guides the homogenous distribution of Li+ and facilitates the transport of Li+ through LiF and Li3N, promoting uniform Li+ plating and stripping. Moreover, the CEI with antioxidative amide groups can suppress the parasitic reactions between cathode and electrolyte and the structural degradation of cathode. Meanwhile, a unique two&#8208;stage rheology&#8208;tuning UV polymerization strategy is utilized, which is quite suited for continuous electrolyte fabrication with environmental friendliness. The fabricated polymer electrolyte exhibits a high ionic conductivity of 1.01 mS cm&#8722;1 at room temperature. 4.5&#160;V NCM622//Li batteries achieve prolonged operation with a retention rate of 85.0% after 500 cycles at 0.5 C. This work provides new insights into molecular design and processibility design for polymer&#8208;based high&#8208;voltage batteries.

         <title>MDM2&#8208;Targeting Reassembly Peptide (TRAP) Nanoparticles for p53&#8208;Based Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
ATO@MtrapNP construction, followed by MDM2&#8208;trap construction and mutated p53 rescuer delivering for oncotherapy is described. This strategy allows for efficient delivery of p53 mutation rescuers and thus suppresses the associated side effects. At the same time, the MDM2 trap can be constructed to efficiently inhibit MDM2 function, thereby protecting p53 from MDM2 inhibition.








Abstract
Gene mutations and functional inhibition are the major obstacles for p53&#8208;mediated oncotherapy. For p53&#8208;wild&#8208;type tumors, the underlying mechanisms of functional inhibition of p53 during oncogenesis are unknown. The results reveal that the expression of the MDM2 inhibitor ARF is inhibited in p53&#8208;wild&#8208;type tumors, indicating that the restoration of ARF could be a potential oncotherapy strategy for p53&#8208;wild&#8208;type tumors. Therefore, ARF&#8208;mimetic MDM2&#8208;targeting reassembly peptide nanoparticles (MtrapNPs) for p53&#8208;based tumor therapy is developed. The results elucidated that the MtrapNPs respond to and form a nanofiber structure with MDM2. By trapping MDM2, the MtrapNPs stabilize and activate p53 for the inhibition of p53&#8208;wild&#8208;type tumors. In most cases, reactivated mutant p53 is inhibited and degraded by MDM2. In the present study, MtrapNPs are used to load and deliver arsenic trioxide, a p53 mutation rescuer, for p53&#8208;mutated tumor treatment in both orthotopic and metastatic models, and they exhibit significant therapeutic effects. Therefore, the study provides evidence supporting a link between decreased ARF expression and tumor development in patients with p53&#8208;wild&#8208;type tumors. Thus, the MDM2&#8208;trap strategy, which addresses both the inhibition and mutations of p53, is an efficient strategy for the treatment of p53&#8208;mutated tumors.

         <title>Computationally Guided Synthesis of MXenes by Dry Selective Extraction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The feasibility of a dry, fluorine&#8208;free MXene synthesis route is investigated through quantum mechanics calculations and thermodynamic modeling. Computational insights are experimentally validated to demonstrate synthesis of MXenes through dry selective extraction (DSE) of MAX phase precursors using iodine vapor under suitable temperatures and pressures. The DSE approach opens avenues for the sustainable and scalable synthesis of new MXenes.








Abstract
MXenes are a rapidly growing family of 2D&#160;transition metal carbides and nitrides&#160;that&#160;are promising for various applications, including energy storage and conversion, electronics, and healthcare. Hydrofluoric&#8208;acid&#8208;based etchants are typically used for large&#8208;scale and high&#8208;throughput synthesis of MXenes, which also leads to a mixture of surface terminations that impede MXene properties. Herein, a computational thermodynamic model with experimental validation is presented to explore the feasibility of fluorine&#8208;free synthesis of MXenes with uniform surface terminations by dry selective extraction (DSE) from precursor MAX phases using iodine vapors. A range of MXenes&#160;and respective precursor compositions are systematically screened using first&#8208;principles calculations to find candidates with high phase stability and low etching energy. A thermodynamic model based on the &#8220;CALculation of PHAse Diagrams&#8221; (CALPHAD) approach is further demonstrated, using Ti3C2I2 as an example, to assess the Gibbs free energy of the DSE reaction and the state of the byproducts as a function of temperature and pressure. Based on the assessment, the optimal synthesis temperature and vapor pressure are predicted and further verified by experiments. This work opens an avenue for scalable, fluorine&#8208;free dry synthesis of MXenes with compositions and surface chemistries that are not accessible using wet chemical etching.

         <title>Pulsed&#8208;Laser&#8208;Triggered Piezoelectric Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction over Tetragonal BaTiO3 Nanocubes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transient pressure induced by a 355&#160;nm pulsed laser (PL) builds a pulsed built&#8208;in electric field on tetragonal BaTiO3 (BTO&#8208;T), contributing to the photoinduced carrier separation and band bending of the BTO&#8208;T. The PL&#8208;triggered piezoelectric photocatalytic CO2 reduction realizes a millimole level CO yield of 52.9&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, and efficient continuous photocatalysis (0.8&#160;mmol h&#8722;1).








Abstract
The recombination of photoinduced carriers in photocatalysts is considered one of the biggest barriers to the increase of photocatalytic efficiency. Piezoelectric photocatalysts open a new route to realize rapid carrier separation by mechanically distorting the lattice of piezoelectric nanocrystals to form a piezoelectric potential within the nanocrystals, generally requiring external force (e.g., ultrasonic radiation, mechanical stirring, and ball milling). In this study, a low&#8208;power UV pulsed laser (PL) (3&#160;W, 355&#160;nm) as a UV light source can trigger piezoelectric photocatalytic CO2 reduction of tetragonal BaTiO3 (BTO&#8208;T) in the absence of an applied force. The tremendous transient light pressure (5.7 &#215; 107&#160;Pa, 2.7&#160;W) of 355&#160;nm PL not only bends the energy band of BTO&#8208;T, thus allowing reactions that cannot theoretically occur to take place, but also induces a pulsed built&#8208;in electric field to determine an efficient photoinduced carrier separation. On that basis, the PL&#8208;triggered piezoelectric photocatalytic CO2 reduction realizes the highest reported performance, reaching a millimole level CO yield of 52.9&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and achieving efficient photocatalytic CO2 reduction in the continuous catalytic system. The method in this study is promising to contribute to the design of efficient piezoelectric photocatalytic reactions.

         <title>Metal Core&#8211;Shell Nanoparticle Supercrystals: From Photoactivation of Hydrogen Evolution to Photocorrosion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photocatalytic activity of plasmonic supercrystals made of Ag@Pt nanoparticles is monitored through operando nanobubble imaging by high&#8208;resolution optical microscopy. The degradation mechanisms following light irradiation are investigated at the single supercrystal and nanoparticle level by correlative microscopy and high&#8208;resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy&#8211;electron energy loss spectroscopy, respectively.








Abstract
Gas nanobubbles are directly linked to many important chemical reactions. While they can be detrimental to operational devices, they also reflect the local activity at the nanoscale. Here, supercrystals made of highly monodisperse Ag@Pt core&#8211;shell nanoparticles are first grown onto a solid support and fully characterized by electron microscopies and X&#8208;ray scattering. Supercrystals are then used as a plasmonic photocatalytic platform for triggering the hydrogen evolution reaction. The catalytic activity is measured operando at the single supercrystal level by high&#8208;resolution optical microscopy, which allows gas nanobubble nucleation to be probed at the early stage with high temporal resolution and the amount of gas molecules trapped inside them to be quantified. Finally, a correlative microscopy approach and high&#8208;resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy help to decipher the mechanisms at the origin of the local degradation of the supercrystals during catalysis, namely nanoscale erosion and corrosion.

         <title>Evidence of Nodal Superconductivity in Monolayer 1H&#8208;TaS2 with Hidden Order Fluctuations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>Unconventional, nodal superconductors appear in many strongly correlated systems, including cuprate superconductors and heavy&#8208;fermion systems. However, nodal monolayer van der Waals superconductors have not yet been reported. The scanning tunneling microscopy experiments on 1H&#8208;TaS2 demonstrate nodal superconductivity in a van der Waals monolayer, providing a building block for van der Waals heterostructures exploiting unconventional superconducting states.








Abstract
Unconventional superconductors represent one of the fundamental directions in modern quantum materials research. In particular, nodal superconductors are known to appear naturally in strongly correlated systems, including cuprate superconductors and heavy&#8208;fermion systems. Van der Waals materials hosting superconducting states are well known, yet nodal monolayer van der Waals superconductors have remained elusive. Here, using low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) experiments, it is shown that pristine monolayer 1H&#8208;TaS2 realizes a nodal superconducting state. Non&#8208;magnetic disorder drives the nodal superconducting state to a conventional gapped s&#8208;wave state.

     alt="Evidence of Nodal Superconductivity in Monolayer 1H-TaS2 with Hidden Order Fluctuations"/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unconventional, nodal superconductors appear in many strongly correlated systems, including cuprate superconductors and heavy-fermion systems. However, nodal monolayer van der Waals superconductors have not yet been reported. The scanning tunneling microscopy experiments on 1H-TaS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; demonstrate nodal superconductivity in a van der Waals monolayer, providing a building block for van der Waals heterostructures exploiting unconventional superconducting states.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unconventional superconductors represent one of the fundamental directions in modern quantum materials research. In particular, nodal superconductors are known to appear naturally in strongly correlated systems, including cuprate superconductors and heavy-fermion systems. Van der Waals materials hosting superconducting states are well known, yet nodal monolayer van der Waals superconductors have remained elusive. Here, using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) experiments, it is shown that pristine monolayer 1H-TaS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; realizes a nodal superconducting state. Non-magnetic disorder drives the nodal superconducting state to a conventional gapped s-wave state. Furthermore, many-body excitations emerge close to the gap edge, signalling a potential unconventional pairing mechanism. The results demonstrate the emergence of nodal superconductivity in a van der Waals monolayer, providing a building block for van der Waals heterostructures exploiting unconventional superconducting&#160;states.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Non&#8208;Lignin Constructing the Gas&#8211;Solid Interface for Enhancing the Photothermal Catalytic Water Vapor Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A K&#8208;SrTiO3&#8208;loaded TiN silica wool (K&#8208;STO/TiN SW) is used to build photothermal&#8211;photocatalytic system. TiN SW enables stable steam production and produced a gas/solid reaction interface with a lower Gibbs free energy. This enables K&#8208;STO to split water vapor into hydrogen and oxygen, and ensures that the TiN SW substrate material does not involve in the catalytic reaction.








Abstract
The progress of solar&#8208;driven water&#8208;splitting technology has been impeded by the limited light response capability of semiconductor materials. Despite attempts to leverage nearly 50% of infrared radiation for photothermal synergy and catalytic reaction enhancement, heat loss during liquid phase reactions results in low energy conversion efficiency. Here, the photothermally driven catalytic water&#8208;splitting system, which designs K&#8208;SrTiO3&#8208;loaded TiN silica wool at the water&#8211;air interface. Photocatalytic tests and density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the thermal effect transforms liquid water into water vapor, thereby reducing the reaction free energy of catalysts and improving the transmission rate of catalytic products. Hence, the hydrogen evolution rate reaches 275.46&#160;mmol m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1, and the solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen (STH) efficiency is 1.81% under 1 sun irradiation in this gas&#8211;solid system, which is more than twice that of liquid water splitting. This novel photothermal catalytic pathway, which involves a coupled reaction of water evaporation and water splitting, is anticipated to broaden the utilization range of the solar spectrum and significantly enhance the conversion efficiency of STH.

         <title>Anion Confinement for Homogeneous Mixed Halide Perovskite Film Growth by Electrospray</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrospray deposition shows great advance to bridge the gap of growth rate between iodide and bromide components by spatially confining the anion diffusion, which universally improves the homogeneity of perovskite films. As a result, the efficiency and stability of wide&#8208;bandgap PSCs are significantly promoted.








Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites are promising absorbers for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art tandem solar cells to feasibly surpass Shockley&#8211;Queisser limit with low cost. However, the commonly used mixed halide perovskites suffer from poor stability; particularly, photoinduced phase segregation. Electrospray deposition is developed to bridge the gap of growth rate between iodide and bromide components during film growth by spatially confining the anion diffusion and eliminating the kinetic difference, which universally improves the initial homogeneity of perovskite films regardless of device architectures. It thus promotes the efficiency and stability of corresponding solar cells based on wide&#8208;bandgap (1.68&#160;eV) absorbers. Remarkable power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 21.44% and 20.77% are achieved in 0.08 cm2 and 1.0 cm2 devices, respectively. In addition, these devices maintain 90% of their initial PCE after 1550&#160;h of stabilized power output (SPO) tracking upon one sun irradiation (LED) at room temperature.

         <title>An AND Logic Gate for Magnetic&#8208;Resonance&#8208;Imaging&#8208;Guided Ferroptosis Therapy of Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembled exceedingly small magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (IO) with the function of an AND logic gate are designed and constructed for enhancing the sensitivity of tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;responsiveness, whose advantages include the conversion of negative T2 signal to positive T1 signal under the dual action of ROS and GSH in the TME and high&#8208;performance ferroptosis therapy of tumors.








Abstract
To improve the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) efficiency and ferroptosis therapy efficacy of exceedingly small magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (IO, &lt;5&#160;nm) for tumors via enhancing the sensitivity of tumor microenvironment (TME) responsiveness, inspired by molecular logic gates, a self&#8208;assembled IO with an AND logic gate function is designed and constructed. Typically, cystamine (CA) is conjugated onto the end of poly(2&#8208;methylthio&#8208;ethanol methacrylate) (PMEMA) to generate PMEMA&#8208;CA. The PMEMA&#8208;CA is grafted onto the surface of brequinar (BQR)&#8208;loaded IO to form IO&#8208;BQR@PMEMA. The self&#8208;assembled IO&#8208;BQR@PMEMA (SA&#8208;IO&#8208;BQR@PMEMA) is obtained due to the hydrophobicity of PMEMA. The carbon&#8211;sulfur single bond of PMEMA&#8208;CA can be oxidized by reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the TME to a thio&#8211;oxygen double bond, resulting in the conversion from being hydrophobic to hydrophilic. The disulfide bond of PMEMA&#8208;CA can be broken by the glutathione (GSH) in the TME, leading to the shedding of PMEMA from the IO surface. Under the dual actions of ROS and GSH in TME (i.e., AND logic gate), SA&#8208;IO&#8208;BQR@PMEMA can be disassembled to release IO, Fe2+/3+, and BQR. In vitro and in vivo results demonstrate the AND logic gate function and mechanism, the high T1 MRI performance and exceptional ferroptosis therapy efficacy for tumors, and the excellent biosafety of SA&#8208;IO&#8208;BQR@PMEMA.

         <title>Antibacterial Fusobacterium nucleatum&#8208;Mimicking Nanomedicine to Selectively Eliminate Tumor&#8208;Colonized Bacteria and Enhance Immunotherapy Against Colorectal Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Fusobacterium&#160;nucleatum&#8208;mimetic nanomedicine is presented, by fusing F. nucleatum cytoplasmic membrane (FM) with Colistin&#8208;loaded liposomes&#160;to achieve selective killing of tumor&#8208;colonizing F. nucleatum. In F. nucleatum&#8208;infected subcutaneous colorectal tumor models and a chemically induced spontaneous colorectal cancer model, such F. nucleatum&#8208;mimetic nanomedicine can effectively relieve F. nucleatum&#8208;derived pro&#8208;tumoral microenvironment and improve the therapeutic efficacy of immunotherapy.








Abstract
Clinical evidence indicates that tumor&#8208;colonizing bacteria can be closely related to the tumor development and therapeutic responses. Selectively eliminating bacteria within tumors may be an attractive approach to enhance cancer treatment without additional side effects. Herein, it is found that, owing to the high affinity between the membrane protein Fap&#8208;2 on Fusobacterium nucleatum and d&#8208;galactose&#8208;&#946; (1&#8208;3)&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;d&#8208;galactosamine (Gal&#8208;GalNAc) overexpressed on colorectal tumor cells, F. nucleatum can colonize in colorectal tumors, as evidenced by both clinical samples and animal tumor models. Notably, F. nucleatum colonized in colorectal tumors can lead to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, greatly reducing their responses to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. Inspired by this finding, an F. nucleatum&#8208;mimetic nanomedicine is designed by fusing F. nucleatum cytoplasmic membrane (FM) with Colistin&#8208;loaded liposomes to achieve selective killing of tumor&#8208;colonizing F. nucleatum without affecting gut microbes. As a result, the therapeutic responses of F. nucleatum&#8208;colonized tumors to ICB therapies can be successfully restored, as demonstrated in an F. nucleatum&#8208;infected subcutaneous CT&#8208;26 tumor model, chemically induced spontaneous colorectal cancer models, and MC&#8208;38 tumor model. In summary, this work presents an F. nucleatum&#8208;mimicking nanomedicine that can selectively eliminate tumor&#8208;colonized bacteria, which is promising for enhancing the responses of cancer immunotherapy against F. nucleatum&#8208;colonized colorectal cancer.

Selectively eliminating bacteria within tumors may be an attractive approach to enhance cancer treatment without additional side effects. Herein, it is found that, owing to the high affinity between the membrane protein Fap-2 on &lt;i&gt;Fusobacterium nucleatum&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-galactose-&#946; (1-3)-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetyl-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-galactosamine (Gal-GalNAc) overexpressed on colorectal tumor cells, &lt;i&gt;F. nucleatum&lt;/i&gt; can colonize in colorectal tumors, as evidenced by both clinical samples and animal tumor models. Notably, &lt;i&gt;F. nucleatum&lt;/i&gt; colonized in colorectal tumors can lead to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, greatly reducing their responses to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. Inspired by this finding, an &lt;i&gt;F. nucleatum&lt;/i&gt;-mimetic nanomedicine is designed by fusing &lt;i&gt;F. nucleatum&lt;/i&gt; cytoplasmic membrane (FM) with Colistin-loaded liposomes to achieve selective killing of tumor-colonizing &lt;i&gt;F. nucleatum&lt;/i&gt; without affecting gut microbes. As a result, the therapeutic responses of &lt;i&gt;F. nucleatum&lt;/i&gt;-colonized tumors to ICB therapies can be successfully restored, as demonstrated in an &lt;i&gt;F. nucleatum&lt;/i&gt;-infected subcutaneous CT-26 tumor model, chemically induced spontaneous colorectal cancer models, and MC-38 tumor model. In summary, this work presents an &lt;i&gt;F. nucleatum&lt;/i&gt;-mimicking nanomedicine that can selectively eliminate tumor-colonized bacteria, which is promising for enhancing the responses of cancer immunotherapy against &lt;i&gt;F. nucleatum&lt;/i&gt;-colonized colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Phosphorescent&#8208;Dye&#8208;Sensitized Quantum&#8208;Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with 37% External Quantum Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Red quantum&#8208;dot light&#8208;emitting diodes with TFB:10 wt% Ir(MDQ)2(acac) as hole&#8208;transport layer and exciton harvester realize a record high external quantum efficiency of 37% (37.3 cd A&#8722;1, 41 lm W&#8722;1) and a central wavelength of 628 nm with narrow full width at half&#8208;maximum of 23.4 nm. The devices also exhibit good stability and reproducibility.








Abstract
Exciton harvesting is of paramount importance for quantum&#8208;dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs). Direct exciton harvesting by the quantum dots (QDs) emitting layer suffers from poor hole injection due to the low conduction bands and valence bands of QDs, leading to unbalanced electron&#8211;hole injection and recombination. To address this issue, here, an exciton sensitizing approach is reported, where excitons form on a phosphorescent&#8208;dye&#8208;doped layer, which then transfer their energies to adjacent QDs layer for photon emission. Due to the very efficient exciton formation and energy&#8208;transfer processes, higher device performance can be achieved. To demonstrate the above strategy, red QLEDs with a phosphorescent dye, iridium (III) bis(2&#8208;methyldibenzo&#8208;[f,h]quinoxaline) (acetylacetonate), Ir(MDQ)2(acac), doped hole&#8208;transporting layer are fabricated and studied. At a doping concentration of 10&#160;wt%, the best device achieves record high current efficiency, power efficiency, and external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 37.3&#160;cd A&#8722;1, 41&#160;lm W&#8722;1, and 37%, respectively. Simultaneously, the efficiency roll&#8208;off characteristic is greatly improved, in that 35% EQE can be well retained at a high luminance level of 450&#8201;000&#160;cd m&#8722;2. Moreover, the devices also exhibit good stability and reproducibility.

         <title>A Smart Single&#8208;Fluorophore Polymer: Self&#8208;Assembly Shapechromic Multicolor Fluorescence and Erasable Ink</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A smart single&#8208;fluorophore polymer polyethyleneimine&#8208;grafted pyrene (PGP) incorporating four stimuli&#8208;triggers: amphiphilicity, supramolecular host&#8211;guest sites, pyrene fluorescence indicator, and reversible chelation sites, exhibits deformation and shape&#8208;dependent fluorescence in response to external stimuli. Besides, PGP driven by its reversible chelation capacity can be used as an advanced fluorescent ink with erasable and recoverable properties.








Abstract
A novel smart fluorescent polymer polyethyleneimine&#8208;grafted pyrene (PGP) is developed by incorporating four stimuli&#8208;triggers at molecular level. The triggers are amphiphilicity, supramolecular host&#8211;guest sites, pyrene fluorescence indicator, and reversible chelation sites. PGP exhibits smart deformation and shape&#8208;dependent fluorescence in response to external stimuli. It can deform into three typical shapes with a characteristic fluorescence color, namely, spherical core&#8211;shell micelles of cyan&#8208;green fluorescence, standard rectangular nanosheets of yellow fluorescence, and irregular branches of deep&#8208;blue fluorescence. A quasi&#8208;reversible deformation between the first two shapes can be dynamically manipulated. Moreover, driven by reversible coordination and the resulting intramolecular photoinduced electron transfer, PGP can be used as an aqueous fluorescence ink with erasable and recoverable properties. The fluorescent patterns printed by PGP ink on paper can be rapidly erased and recovered by simple spraying a sequence of Cu2+ and ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid aqueous solutions. This erase/recover transformation can be repeated multiple times on the same paper. The multiple stimulus responsiveness of PGP makes it have potential applications in nanorobots, sensing, information encryption, and anticounterfeiting.

         <title>Asymmetric Directional Control of Thermal Emission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Directional control of thermal emission is key to efficient radiative heat transport. However, achieving angular&#8208;asymmetric directionality remains challenging in reciprocal systems due to symmetric band dispersion. In this work, asymmetric directional thermal emission is demonstrated using symmetry&#8208;broken metagratings. The design principle holds promise for developing ultrathin customized thermal sources and impacts on thermal&#8208;engineering applications.








Abstract
Control over the directionality of thermal emission plays a fundamental role in efficient heat transport. Although nanophotonic technologies have demonstrated the capability for angular&#8208;selective thermal emission, achieving asymmetric directional thermal emission in reciprocal systems with energy directed to a single output angle remains challenging due to symmetric band dispersion. In this work, a general strategy for achieving asymmetric directional thermal emission in reciprocal systems is presented. With periodic perturbation and broken mirror symmetry, metasurfaces behave as resonant metagratings whose resonances can be diffracted to symmetric output angles with distinct efficiency, allowing for high emissivity toward a single direction. An asymmetric directional thermal emitter is experimentally demonstrated at mid&#8208;infrared wavelengths with high emissivity (&#603;&#160;=&#160;0.61) at the observation angle of +30&#176;, and low emissivity (&#603; &lt; 0.3) at other angles. This work highlights the potential for manipulating the directionality of thermal emission, which holds promise for developing ultrathin customized thermal sources and impacts on various thermal&#8208;engineering applications.

Immunothrombosis
Thrombin's enzymatic activity in the living organism was for the first time measured in the exhaled breath. Novel nanoprobes released a gaseous reporter in potentially fatal microthrombi. This technology aims to improve precision of care in serious conditions including sepsis, COVID&#8208;19, diabetes complications, and lung fibrosis. More details can be found in article number 2304903 by Ali Hafezi&#8208;Moghadam and co&#8208;workers. Nanoprobes and fibrin strands in a microvessel were digitally painted by Dr. Alexander Schering.

More details can be found in article number &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202304903"&gt;2304903&lt;/a&gt; by Ali Hafezi-Moghadam and co-workers. Nanoprobes and fibrin strands in a microvessel were digitally painted by Dr. Alexander Schering.

Organic Image Sensors
In article number 2302786, Do Hwan Kim, BongSoo Kim, Dae Sung Chung, and co&#8208;workers show that crosslinkable perfluoroaryl azide can be a trigger for photomultiplication phenomenon of organic photodiode once electrostatic interaction is maximized between the perfluoroaryl group and donor material, and it can work as efficiently as conventional acceptor molecules while maintaining the advantageous features of crosslinking, i.e., stability and patternability.

Atomic&#8208;Scale Synthesis
In article number 2301560 by Ondrej Dyck, Andrew R. Lupini, and Stephen Jesse, a vision for a revolution in STEM capabilities is presented. The vision is a &#8220;synthescope&#8221; &#8208; an instrument that can image, characterize, synthesize, and manipulate materials at the atomic scale through advanced microscopy techniques. The critical insight is the delivery of atomized material to the sample for a combined top&#8208;down (fabrication) and bottom&#8208;up (synthesis) approach to atomic&#8208;scale materials engineering.

Nodal Superconductivity
Artistic representation of TaS2, the first monolayer van der Waals material featuring nodal superconductivity in the ultra&#8208;clean limit. Experiments with scanning tunneling spectroscopy reveal the appearance of a nodal gap characteristic of strongly correlated superconductors, and the existence of many&#8208;body inelastic excitations at finite energies associated with hidden order fluctuations. More details can be found in article number 2305409 by Jose L. Lado, Peter Liljeroth, and co&#8208;workers.

         <title>Stabilizing Metal Halide Perovskites for Solar Fuel Production: Challenges, Solutions, and Future Prospects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal halide perovskites have recently emerged as one of the promising photocatalysts for solar fuel production due to their exceptional photophysical properties. This review focuses on their most pressing stability issue for practical applications and summarizes the latest stabilization strategies to design and prepare water&#8208;stable perovskite photocatalysts.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) are emerging photocatalyst materials that can enable sustainable solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion by virtue of their broad absorption spectra, effective separation/transport of photogenerated carriers, and solution processability. Although preliminary studies show the excellent photocatalytic activities of MHPs, their intrinsic structural instability due to the low formation energy and soft ionic nature is an open challenge for their practical applications. This review discusses the latest understanding of the stability issue and strategies to overcome this issue for MHP&#8208;based photocatalysis. First, the origin of the instability issue at atomic levels and the design rules for robust structures are analyzed and elucidated. This is then followed by presenting several different material design strategies for stability enhancement, including reaction medium modification, material surface protection, structural dimensionality engineering, and chemical composition engineering. Emphases are placed on understanding the effects of these strategies on photocatalytic stability as well as the possible structure&#8208;performance correlation. Finally, the possible future research directions for pursuing stable and efficient MHP photocatalysts in order to accelerate their technological maturity on a practical scale are outlined. With that, it is hoped to provide readers a valuable snapshot of this rapidly developing and exciting field.

         <title>Liquid Crystals for Advanced Smart Devices with Microwave and Millimeter&#8208;Wave Applications: Recent Progress for Next&#8208;Generation Communications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective focuses on using liquid crystals (LCs) to improve driving performance and add special functions to smart RF devices. Since the design of the RF device itself imposes limits on maximization of performance, it must be considered in the materials domain. The fundamental understanding of LCs for advanced reconfigurable telecommunication devices and key research directions are discussed, suggesting design strategies for LCs in advanced smart RF devices with improved driving performance and functionality.








Abstract
Liquid crystals (LCs) technology have a well&#8208;established history of applications in visible light, particularly in the display industry. However, with the rapid growth in communication technology, LCs have become a topic of current interest for high&#8208;frequency microwave (MW) and millimeter&#8208;wave (mmWave) applications due to promising characteristics such as tunability, continuous tuning, low losses, and price compatibility. To improve the performance of future communication technology using LCs, it is not sufficient only with the perspective of radio&#8208;frequency (RF) technology. Therefore, it is imperative to understand not only the novel structural designs and optimization of MW engineering but also the perspective of materials engineering when implementing advanced RF devices with maximum performance for next&#8208;generation satellite and terrestrial communication. Herein, based on advanced nematic LCs, polymer&#8208;modified LCs, dual&#8208;frequency LCs, and photo&#8208;reactive LCs, this article summarizes and examines the modulation principles and key research directions for the design strategies of LCs for advanced smart RF devices with improved driving performance and novel functionality. Furthermore, the challenges in development of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art smart RF devices that use LCs are discussed.

         <title>Deep Learning in Mechanical Metamaterials: From Prediction and Generation to Inverse Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive overview of the capabilities of deep learning in mechanical metamaterials, from property prediction and geometry generation to inverse design. It is highly anticipated that deep learning can bring about significant advancements in mechanical metamaterials by creating universally applicable datasets, intelligently designed metamaterials, and material intelligence in the near&#160;future.








Abstract
Mechanical metamaterials are meticulously designed structures with exceptional mechanical properties determined by their microstructures and constituent materials. Tailoring their material and geometric distribution unlocks the potential to achieve unprecedented bulk properties and functions. However, current mechanical metamaterial design considerably relies on experienced designers' inspiration through trial and error, while investigating their mechanical properties and responses entails time&#8208;consuming mechanical testing or computationally expensive simulations. Nevertheless, recent advancements in deep learning have revolutionized the design process of mechanical metamaterials, enabling property prediction and geometry generation without prior knowledge. Furthermore, deep generative models can transform conventional forward design into inverse design. Many recent studies on the implementation of deep learning in mechanical metamaterials are highly specialized, and their pros and cons may not be immediately evident. This critical review provides a comprehensive overview of the capabilities of deep learning in property prediction, geometry generation, and inverse design of mechanical metamaterials. Additionally, this review highlights the potential of leveraging deep learning to create universally applicable datasets, intelligently designed metamaterials, and material intelligence. This article is expected to be valuable not only to researchers working on mechanical metamaterials but also those in the field of materials&#160;informatics.

         <title>Ultrafast and Controlled Capturing, Loading, and Release of Extracellular Vesicles by a Portable Microstructured Electrochemical Fluidic Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A portable device that offers an &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip approach, capable of separating extracellular vesicles directly from biological fluids in a simple and efficient manner, while also allowing their subsequent manipulation, is reported. The device is composed of a fluidic channel confined within antibody&#8208;coated microstructured electrodes.








Abstract
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are secreted by all living cells and are found in body fluids. They exert numerous physiological and pathological functions and serve as cargo shuttles. Due to their safety and inherent bioactivity, they have emerged as versatile therapeutic agents, biomarkers, and potential drug carriers. Despite the growing interest in EVs, current progress in this field is, in part, limited by relatively inefficient isolation techniques. Conventional methods are indeed slow, laborious, require specialized laboratory equipment, and may result in low yield and purity. This work describes an electrochemically controlled &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; device enabling capturing, loading, and releasing of EVs. The device is composed of a fluidic channel confined within antibody&#8208;coated microstructured electrodes. It rapidly isolates EVs with a high level of purity from various biofluids. As a proof of principle, the device is applied to isolate EVs from skin wounds of healthy and diabetic mice. Strikingly, it is found that EVs from healing wounds of diabetic mice are enriched in mitochondrial proteins compared to those of healthy mice. Additionally, the device improves the loading protocol of EVs with polyplexes, and may therefore find applications in nucleic acid delivery. Overall, the electrochemical device can greatly facilitate the development of EVs&#8208;based technologies.

         <title>Toward Chiral Lasing from All&#8208;Solution&#8208;Processed Flexible Perovskite&#8208;Nanocrystal&#8211;Liquid&#8208;Crystal Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral amplified spontaneous emission (ASE)/lasing from a free&#8208;standing membrane consisting of perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) and cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs) layers is demonstrated. Two CLCs layers with same helical structure act as reflectors to construct a Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot cavity. The selective reflection of CLCs leads to polarization selectivity. The membrane device is highly flexible and all&#8208;solution&#8208;processable and exhibits a high dissymmetry factor of 1.4.








Abstract
Circularly polarized (CP) coherent light sources are of great potential for various advanced optical applications spanning displays/imaging to data processing/encryption and quantum communication. Here, the first demonstration of CP amplified spontaneous emission (ASE)/lasing from a free&#8208;standing and flexible membrane device is reported. The membrane device consists of perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) and cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs)&#160;layers sandwiched within a Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot (F&#8211;P) cavity architecture. The chiral liquid crystal cavity enables the generation of CP light from the device. The device is completely solution&#8208;processable and displays CP ASE with record dissymmetry factor (glum) as high as 1.4, which is 3 orders of magnitude higher as compared with glum of CP luminescence of chiral ligand&#8208;capped colloidal PNCs. The device exhibits ultraflexibility as the ASE intensity remains unchanged after repeated 100 bending cycles and it is stable for more than 3 months with 80% of its original intensity. Furthermore, the ultraflexibility enables the generation of ASE from various objects of different geometric surfaces covered with the flexible perovskite membrane device. This work not only demonstrates the first CP ASE from a PNCs membrane with extremely high glum but also opens the door toward the fabrication of ultraflexible, extremely stable, and all solution&#8208;processable perovskite chiral laser devices.

&lt;p&gt;Chiral amplified spontaneous emission (ASE)/lasing from a free-standing membrane consisting of perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) and cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs) layers is demonstrated. Two CLCs layers with same helical structure act as reflectors to construct a Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot cavity. The selective reflection of CLCs leads to polarization selectivity. The membrane device is highly flexible and all-solution-processable and exhibits a high dissymmetry factor of 1.4.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circularly polarized (CP) coherent light sources are of great potential for various advanced optical applications spanning displays/imaging to data processing/encryption and quantum communication. Here, the first demonstration of CP amplified spontaneous emission (ASE)/lasing from a free-standing and flexible membrane device is reported. The membrane device consists of perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) and cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs)&#160;layers sandwiched within a Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot (F&#8211;P) cavity architecture.

         <title>A 3D&#8208;Printed Assemblable Bespoke Scaffold as a Versatile Microcryogel Carrier for Site&#8208;Specific Regenerative Medicine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hive&#8208;structured assemblable bespoke scaffold (HIVE) can be manually assembled in any shape/size with ease, so surgeons can create a scaffold that will best fit a defect. Simultaneously, it can have site&#8208;specific treatments by working as a carrier filled with microcryogels incorporating different biological factors in different pockets of HIVE. This simple and cost&#8208;effective patient&#8208;specific implant reduces the healthcare system burden.








Abstract
Advances in additive manufacturing have led to diverse patient&#8208;specific implant designs utilizing computed tomography, but this requires intensive work and financial implications. Here, Digital Light Processing is used to fabricate a hive&#8208;structured assemblable bespoke scaffold (HIVE). HIVE can be manually assembled in any shape/size with ease, so a surgeon can create a scaffold that will best fit a defect before implantation. Simultaneously, it can have site&#8208;specific treatments by working as a carrier filled with microcryogels (MC) incorporating different biological factors in different pockets of HIVE. After characterization, possible site&#8208;specific applications are investigated by utilizing HIVE as a versatile carrier with incorporated treatments such as growth factors (GF), bioceramic, or cells. HIVE as a GF&#8208;carrier shows a controlled release of bone morphogenetic protein/vascular endothelial growth factor (BMP/VEGF) and induced osteogenesis/angiogenesis from human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC)/human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Furthermore, as a bioceramic&#8208;carrier, HIVE demonstrates enhanced mineralization and osteogenesis, and as a HUVEC carrier, it upregulates both osteogenic and angiogenic gene expression of hMSCs. HIVE with different combinations of MCs yields a distinct local effect and successful cell migration is confirmed within assembled HIVEs. Finally, an in vivo&#160;rat subcutaneous implantation demonstrates site&#8208;specific osteogenesis and angiogenesis.

         <title>Near&#8208; and Far&#8208;Field Observation of Phonon Polaritons in Wafer&#8208;Scale Multilayer Hexagonal Boron Nitride Prepared by Chemical Vapor Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Infrared nanoimaging reveals propagating phonon polaritons on wafer&#8208;scale nanometer&#8208;thick hexagonal boron nitride grown by chemical vapor deposition. The material quality allows for the fabrication of phonon polariton nanoresonators with quality factors comparable to those fabricated from exfoliated hexagonal boron nitride, paving the way for wafer&#8208;scale applications.








Abstract
Polaritons in layered materials (LMs) are a promising platform to manipulate and control light at the nanometer scale. Thus, the observation of polaritons in wafer&#8208;scale LMs is critically important for the development of industrially relevant nanophotonics and optoelectronics applications. In this work, phonon polaritons (PhPs) in wafer&#8208;scale multilayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) grown by chemical vapor deposition are reported. By infrared nanoimaging, the PhPs are visualized, and PhP lifetimes of &#8776;0.6&#160;ps are measured, comparable to that of micromechanically exfoliated multilayer hBN. Further, PhP nanoresonators are demonstrated. Their quality factors of &#8776;50 are about 0.7 times that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art devices based on exfoliated hBN. These results can enable PhP&#8208;based surface&#8208;enhanced infrared spectroscopy (e.g., for gas sensing) and infrared photodetector applications.

         <title>Fundamentals, Advances, and Artifacts in Circularly Polarized Luminescence (CPL) Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Circularly polarized luminescence enables exciting applications such as holography, advanced cryptography, and energy&#8208;efficient displays. This Perspective lays out the fundamentals of the corresponding spectroscopic technique and reports a home&#8208;built setup. The corrections necessary for accurate measurements as well as the most common artifacts and pitfalls to avoid are detailed. Custom operating software is made available free of charge.








Abstract
Objects are chiral when they cannot be superimposed with their mirror image. Materials can emit chiral light with an excess of right&#8208; or left&#8208;handed circular polarization. This circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) is key to promising future applications, such as highly efficient displays, holography, sensing, enantiospecific discrimination, synthesis of drugs, quantum computing, and cryptography. Here, a practical guide to CPL spectroscopy is provided. First, the fundamentals of the technique are laid out and a detailed account of recent experimental advances to achieve highly sensitive and accurate measurements is given, including all corrections required to obtain reliable results. Then the most common artifacts and pitfalls are discussed, especially for the study of thin films, for example, based on molecules, polymers, or halide perovskites, as opposed to dilute solutions of emitters. To facilitate the adoption by others, custom operating software is made publicly available, equipping the reader with the tools needed for successful and accurate CPL determination.

         <title>Continuous&#8208;Wave Lasing in Perovskite LEDs with an Integrated Distributed Feedback Resonator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Continuous&#8208;wave lasing in an efficient perovskite LED with an integrated distributed feedback resonator is achieved, showing a low threshold of 220&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 110&#160;K. The LED can also work well at a current density of 330&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2, indicating the carrier injection rate already exceeds the threshold of optically pumping. The results suggest that electrically pumped perovskite laser diodes can be achieved once the Joule heating issue is overcome.








Abstract
Realization of electrically pumped laser diodes based on solution&#8208;processed semiconductors is a long&#8208;standing challenge. Metal halide perovskites have shown great potential toward this goal due to their&#160;excellent optoelectronic properties. Continuous&#8208;wave (CW) optically pumped lasing in a real electroluminescent device represents a key step to current&#8208;injection laser diodes, but it has not yet been realized. This is mainly due to the challenge of incorporating a resonant cavity into an efficient light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) able to sustain intensive carrier injection. Here, CW lasing is reported in an efficient perovskite LED with an integrated distributed feedback resonator, which shows a low lasing threshold of 220&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 110&#160;K. Importantly, the LED works well at a current density of 330&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2, indicating the carrier injection rate already exceeds the threshold of optically pumping. The results suggest that electrically pumped perovskite laser diodes can be achieved once the Joule heating issue is overcome.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Like Stretchable Nanocomposite Using Locally&#8208;Bundled Nanowires for Skin&#8208;Mountable Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A material strategy to fabricate a stretchable nanocomposite with metal&#8208;like conductivity and high stretchability is proposed. When the nanocomposite is solidified in the highly humid air, silver nanowires are locally&#8208;bundled, minimizing contact resistance. Treatment of dual ligands of 1&#8208;propanethiol and 1&#8208;decanethiol improves conductivity further to &#8776;120 000 S cm&#8722;1 while attaining high stretchability of &#8776;200% for skin&#8208;mountable devices.








Abstract
Stretchable conductive nanocomposites have been intensively studied for wearable bioelectronics. However, development of nanocomposites that simultaneously feature metal&#8208;like conductivity(&gt; 100 000 S cm&#8722;1) and high stretchability (&gt; 100%) for high&#8208;performance skin&#8208;mountable devices is still extremely challenging. Here&#160;a material strategy for such a nanocomposite is&#160;presented by using local bundling of silver nanowires stabilized with dual ligands (i.e., 1&#8208;propanethiols and 1&#8208;decanethiols). When the nanocomposite&#160;is&#160;solidified via solvent evaporation under a highly humid condition, the nanowires in the organic solution are bundled and stabilized. The resulting locally&#8208;bundled nanowires lower contact resistance while maintain their percolation network, leading to high conductivity. Dual ligands of 1&#8208;propanethiol and 1&#8208;decanethiol further boost up the conductivity. As a result, a nanocomposite with both high conductivity of &#8776;122,120 S cm&#8722;1 and high stretchability of &#8776;200% is obtained. Such superb electrical and mechanical properties are critical for various applications in skin&#8208;like electronics, and&#160;herein, a wearable thermo&#8208;stimulation device is demonstrated.

         <title>A Cholesterol Metabolic Regulated Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework (HOF)&#8208;Based Biotuner for Antibody Non&#8208;Dependent Immunotherapy Tailored for Glioblastoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile nanocarrier, hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF)&#8208;based biotuner, regulates extra/intracellular cholesterol metabolism for bidirectionally blocking immune checkpoints to metabolically dismantle the immunosuppressive microenvironment. It synergizes with chemiexcited&#8208;PDT to enable effective immunotherapy and significantly inhibit glioblastoma growth. The biotuner is tailored to address the immunotherapeutic dilemma and metabolic characteristics of glioblastomas, providing new insights into the metabolically regulated immunosuppressive microenvironment of glioblastomas.








Abstract
The metabolic reprogramming of glioblastoma (GBM) poses a tremendous obstacle to effective immunotherapy due to its impact on the immunosuppressive microenvironment. In this work, a hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) specifically designed for GBM immunotherapy is developed, taking advantage of the relatively isolated cholesterol metabolism microenvironment in the central nervous system (CNS). The HOF&#8208;based biotuner regulates extra/intracellular cholesterol metabolism, effectively blocking the programmed cell death protein 1/programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1) pathway and reducing 2B4 expression. This metabolically disrupts the immunosuppressive microenvironment of GBM and rejuvenates CD8+ T cells. Moreover, cholesterol metabolism regulation offers additional benefits in treating GBM invasion. Furthermore, tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;initiated chemiexcited photodynamic therapy (PDT) is enhanced during the regulation of cholesterol metabolism, and the biotuner can effectively trigger immunogenic cell death (ICD) and increase the infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in GBM. By reversing the immunosuppressive microenvironment and bolstering chemiexcited&#8208;PDT, this approach invigorates efficient antibody non&#8208;dependent immunotherapy for GBM. This study provides a model for enhancing immunotherapy through cholesterol metabolism regulation and explores the feasibility of a &#8220;metabolic checkpoint&#8221; strategy in GBM treatment.

         <title>Engineering Efficient CAR&#8208;T Cells via Electroactive Nanoinjection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electroactive nanoinjection (ENI) platform consisting of arrays of vertically configured conductive nanotubes, which mediate the loading and efficient nanoinjection of CAR construct into primary human T cells, with negligible cellular damage, is developed. The engineered ENI platform provides a non&#8208;viral, low&#8208;voltage (10&#160;V), scalable, and reusable intracellular delivery system that can generate functional and effective anti&#8208;lymphoma CAR&#8208;T cells.








Abstract
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)&#8208;T cell therapy has emerged as a promising cell&#8208;based immunotherapy approach for treating blood disorders and cancers, but genetically engineering CAR&#8208;T cells is challenging due to primary T cells&#8217; sensitivity to conventional gene delivery approaches. The current viral&#8208;based method can typically involve significant operating costs and biosafety hurdles, while bulk electroporation (BEP) can lead to poor cell viability and functionality. Here, a non&#8208;viral electroactive nanoinjection (ENI) platform is developed to efficiently negotiate the plasma membrane of primary human T cells via vertically configured electroactive nanotubes, enabling efficient delivery (68.7%) and expression (43.3%) of CAR genes in the T cells, with minimal cellular perturbation (&gt;90% cell viability). Compared to conventional BEP, the ENI platform achieves an almost threefold higher CAR transfection efficiency, indicated by the significantly higher reporter GFP expression (43.3% compared to 16.3%). By co&#8208;culturing with target lymphoma Raji cells, the ENI&#8208;transfected CAR&#8208;T cells&#8217; ability to effectively suppress lymphoma cell growth (86.9% cytotoxicity) is proved. Taken together, the results demonstrate the platform's remarkable capacity to generate functional and effective anti&#8208;lymphoma CAR&#8208;T cells. Given the growing potential of cell&#8208;based immunotherapies, such a platform holds great promise for ex vivo cell engineering, especially in CAR&#8208;T cell therapy.

         <title>A Balance between Inter&#8208; and Intra&#8208;Microgel Mechanics Governs Stem Cell Viability in Injectable Dynamic Granular Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A guest&#8208;host injectable microgel formulation strategy is introduced in which flowability and elasticity are tuned independently by modulating inter&#8208; and intra&#8208;microgel crosslinking. Flowability and elasticity represent conflicting constraints for injectable design, &#160;as they respectively govern injection protection and engraftment potential following injection. The balance between these parameters is systematically investigated and found to regulate stem cell viability during injection.








Abstract
Injectable hydrogels are increasingly explored for the delivery of cells to tissue. These materials exhibit both liquid&#8208;like properties, protecting cells from mechanical stress during injection, and solid&#8208;like properties, providing a stable 3D engraftment niche. Many strategies for modulating injectable hydrogels tune liquid&#8208; and solid&#8208;like material properties simultaneously, such that formulation changes designed to improve injectability can reduce stability at the delivery site. The ability to independently tune liquid&#8208; and solid&#8208;like properties would greatly facilitate formulation development. Here, such a strategy is presented in which cells are ensconced in the pores between microscopic granular hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogels (microgels), where elasticity is tuned with static covalent intra&#8208;microgel crosslinks and flowability with mechanosensitive adamantane&#8208;cyclodextrin (AC) inter&#8208;microgel crosslinks. Using the same AC&#8208;free microgels as a 3D printing support bath, the location of each cell is preserved as it exits the needle, allowing identification of&#160;the mechanism driving mechanical trauma&#8208;induced cell death. The microgel AC concentration is varied to find the threshold from microgel yielding&#8208; to AC interaction&#8208;dominated injectability, and this threshold is exploited to fabricate a microgel with better injection&#8208;protecting performance. This delivery strategy, and the balance between intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;microgel properties it reveals, may facilitate the development of new cell injection formulations.

         <title>Universal Strategy of Efficient Intracellular Macromolecule Directional Delivery Using Photothermal Pump Patch</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photothermal pump patch is proposed as a universal structure for a highly efficient, non&#8208;destructive, and in&#8208;vitro/vivo&#8208;applicable intracellular macromolecule directional delivery. It is based on poly(dimethyl siloxane) photothermal expansion&#8208;driven pore shrinkage, which directionally delivers macromolecules into the cell to improve intracellular delivery efficiency. It is also suitable for transdermal intracellular delivery and has broad potential in the fields of cell/gene therapy.








Abstract
The development of a highly efficient, nondestructive, and in vitro/vivo&#8208;applicable universal delivery strategy of therapeutic macromolecules into desired cells and tissues is very challenging. Photothermal methods have advantages in intracellular delivery, particularly in in vivo manipulation. However, the inability of directional transmission of exogenous molecules limits their delivery efficiency. Here, a photothermal pump (PTP) patch with numerous &#8220;exogenous molecular reservoirs&#8221; is reported. Under a laser, the cell membrane ruptures, while &#8220;exogenous molecular reservoirs&#8221; shrink, resulting in a directional exogenous molecule delivery into cells for a high&#8208;efficient intracellular delivery. The PTP patches are considered a universal structure for a highly efficient, nondestructive, and in&#8208;vitro/vivo&#8208;applicable intracellular macromolecule delivery. Under in vivo transdermal intracellular delivery conditions, the target genes are efficiently and noninvasively delivered into epidermal and dermal cells through the PTP patch and exosomes produced by the epidermal cells, respectively. The PTP patch provides a new strategy for a high&#8208;efficiency, nondestructive, and in&#8208;vitro/vivo&#8208;applicable macromolecule delivery.

         <title>From Volumetric to Planar Multiplexing: Phase&#8208;Coded Metasurfaces without the Bragg Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiplexing metasurface based on orthogonal phase encoding is demonstrated to implement a near&#8208;field optical router. Bragg diffraction, which plays a vital role in traditional volume holography,is replaced by mode&#8208;matching surface waves, resulting in the realization of ultrathin metadevices. The method facilitates further development of an additional degree of freedom in the field of photonic multiplexing.








Abstract
Metasurfaces consisting of planar subwavelength structures with minimal thickness are appealing to emerging technologies such as integrated optics and photonic chips for their small footprint and compatibility with sophisticated planar nanofabrication techniques. However, reduced dimensionality due to the 2D nature of a metasurface poses challenges to the adaptation of a few useful methods that have found great success with conventional optics in 3D space. For instance, Bragg diffraction is the foundation of the well&#8208;established technique of phase&#8208;coded multiplexing in volume holography. It relies on interference among the scattered waves from multiple layers across the thickness of a sample. In this work, despite losing the dimension in thickness, a metasurface is devised to experimentally demonstrate phase&#8208;coded multiplexing by replacing free&#8208;space light with a surface wave in its output. The in&#8208;plane interference along the propagation of the surface wave resembles the Bragg diffraction, thus enabling phase&#8208;coded multiplexing in the 2D design. An example of code&#8208;based all&#8208;optical routing is also achieved by using a multiplexed metasurface, which can find applications in photonic data processing and communications.

         <title>Reversible Multielectron Redox Chemistry in a NASICON&#8208;Type Cathode toward High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density and Long&#8208;Life Sodium&#8208;Ion Full Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Fe&#8208;substituted Na3.5V1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3 cathode with Na&#8208;superionic&#8208;conductor (NASICON)&#8208;type structure is proposed, which realizes reversible structural evolution and multielectron redox reactions (Fe2+/Fe3+, V3+/V4+, and V4+/V5+) by incorporating iron, whose unpaired electrons in the 3d orbital are inextricably related to the activation of higher&#8208;voltage redox couple.








Abstract
Na&#8208;superionic&#8208;conductor (NASICON)&#8208;type cathodes (e.g., Na3V2(PO4)3) have attracted extensive attention due to their open and robust framework, fast Na+ mobility, and superior thermal stability. To commercialize sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), higher energy density and lower cost requirements are urgently needed for NASICON&#8208;type cathodes. Herein, Na3.5V1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3 (NVFP) is designed by an Fe&#8208;substitution strategy, which not only reduces the exorbitant cost of vanadium, but also realizes high&#8208;voltage multielectron reactions. The NVFP cathode can deliver extraordinary capacity (148.2&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1), and decent cycling durability up to 84% after 10&#160;000 cycles at 100 C. In situ X&#8208;ray diffraction and ex situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy characterizations reveal reversible structural evolution and redox processes (Fe2+/Fe3+, V3+/V4+, and V4+/V5+) during electrochemical reactions. The low ionic&#8208;migration energy barrier and ideal Na+&#8208;diffusion kinetics are elucidated by density functional theory calculations. Combined with electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, Fe with unpaired electrons in the 3d orbital is inseparable from the higher&#8208;valence redox activation. More competitively, coupling with a hard carbon (HC) anode, HC//NVFP full cells demonstrate high&#8208;rate capability and long&#8208;duration cycling lifespan (3000&#160;stable cycles at 50 C), along with material&#8208;level energy density up to 304&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1. The present work can provide new perspectives to accelerate the commercialization of SIBs.

         <title>Directional Shunting of Photogenerated Carriers in POM@MOF for Promoting Nitrogen Adsorption and Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>The Mo72Fe30@UiO&#8208;66 composite is prepared by a one&#8208;step hydrothermal reaction, which realizes an effective photocatalyst for storing and relaying oxidation N2 by inducing directional shunting of photogenerated carriers under mild conditions. The Mo72Fe30@UiO&#8208;66 exhibits the high N2 adsorption capacity (250.5&#160;cm3 g&#8722;1, at P/P0&#160;=&#160;1) and superior N2 oxidation performance to produce HNO3 (702.4&#160;&#181;g&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1).








Abstract
The efficient catalysis of nitrogen (N2) into high&#8208;value N&#8208;containing products plays a crucial role in the N economic cycle. However, weak N2 adsorption and invalid N2 activation remain two major bottlenecks in rate&#8208;determining steps, leading to low N2 fixation performance. Herein, an effective dual active sites photocatalyst of polyoxometalates (POMs)&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is highlighted via altering coordination microenvironment and inducing directional shunting of photogenerated carriers to facilitate N2/catalyst interaction and enhance oxidation performance. MOFs create more open unsaturated metal cluster sites with unoccupied d orbital possessing Lewis acidity to accept electrons from the 3&#963;g bonding orbital of N2 for storage by combining with POMs to replace bidentate linkers. POMs act as electron sponges donating electrons to MOFs, while the holes directional flow to POMs. The hole&#8208;rich POMs with strong oxidation capacity are easily involved in oxidizing adsorbed N2. Taking UiO&#8208;66 (C48H28O32Zr6) and Mo72Fe30 ([Mo72Fe30O252(CH3COO)12{Mo2O7(H2O)}2{H2Mo2O8(H2O)}(H2O)91]&#183;150H2O) as an example, Mo72Fe30@UiO&#8208;66 shows twofold enhanced adsorption of N2 (250.5&#160;cm3&#160;g&#8722;1) than UiO&#8208;66 (122.9&#160;cm3 g&#8722;1) at P/P0&#160;=&#160;1. And, the HNO3 yield of Mo72Fe30@UiO&#8208;66 is 702.4&#160;&#181;g&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1, &#8776;7&#160;times and 24 times higher than UiO&#8208;66 and Mo72Fe30. This work provides reliable value for the storage and relaying artificial N2 fixation.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Functional Perovskite&#8208;Based Photodetector and Memristor for Visual Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the function of human visual memory, a dual&#8208;functional perovskite&#8208;based photodetector (PD) and memristor is designed, realizing visual perception and memory capacities. The dual&#8208;functional device exhibit excellent performance in both PD and memristor. Such a device provides new opportunities for the mimicry of human visual memory in future multifunctional application.








Abstract
The imitation of human visual memory demands the multifunctional integration of light sensors similar to the eyes, and image memory, similar to the brain. Although humans have already implemented electronic devices with visual memory functions, these devices require a combination of various components and logical circuits. However, the combination&#160;of visual perception and high&#8208;performance information storage capabilities into a single device to achieve visual memory remains challenging. In this study, inspired by the function of human visual memory, a dual&#8208;functional perovskite&#8208;based photodetector (PD) and memristor are designed to realize visual perception and memory capacities. As a PD, it realizes an ultrahigh self&#8208;powered responsivity of 276&#160;mA W&#8722;1, a high detectivity of 4.7&#160;&#215;&#160;1011&#160;Jones (530&#160;nm; light intensities, 2.34&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2), and a high rectification ratio of &#8776;100 (&#177;2&#160;V). As a memristor, an ultrahigh on/off ratio (&#8776;105), an ultralow power consumption of 3&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;11&#160;W, a low setting voltage (0.15&#160;V), and a long retention time (&gt;7000&#160;s) are realized. Moreover, the dual&#8208;functional device has the capacity to perceive and remember light paths and store data with good cyclic stability. This device exhibits perceptual and cyclic erasable memory functions, which provides new opportunities for mimicking human visual memory in future multifunctional applications.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Sensing Platform Based on 2D Monoelement Germanane</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A smartphone&#8208;assisted fluorometric sensing platform based on CH3Ge&#8208;coated paper is developed. CH3Ge paper is suitable for sensing humidity as well as acidic and alkaline gases emitted by spoiled food to track its quality. Further, it is used for printing confidential information using a water inkjet printer and shows significant re&#8208;writability.








Abstract
Covalently functionalized germanane is a novel type of fluorescent probe that can be employed in material science and analytical sensing. Here, a fluorometric sensing platform based on methyl&#8208;functionalized germanane (CH3Ge) is developed for gas (humidity and ammonia) sensing, pH (1&#8211;9) sensing, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. Luminescence (red&#8211;orange) is seen when a gas molecule intercalates into the interlayer space of CH3Ge and the luminescence disappears upon deintercalation. This allows for direct detection of gas absorption via fluorometric measurements of the CH3Ge. Structural and optical properties of CH3Ge with intercalated gas molecules are investigated by density functional theory (DFT). To demonstrate real&#8208;time and on&#8208;the&#8208;spot testing, absorbed gas molecules are first precisely quantified by CH3Ge using a smartphone camera with an installed color intensity processing application (APP). Further, CH3Ge&#8208;paper&#8208;based sensor is integrated into real food packets (e.g., fish and milk) to monitor the shelf life of perishable foods. Finally, CH3Ge&#8208;based rewritable paper is applied in water jet printing to illustrate the potential for secret communication with quick coloration and good reversibility by water evaporation.

         <title>Core Electron Count as a Versatile and Accurate New Descriptor for Sorting Mechanical Properties of Diverse Transition Metal Compounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A full&#8208;electron consideration of both valence electron concentration (VEC) and core electron count (CEC) is invoked in developing a distinct VEC&#8211;CEC descriptor to sort mechanical properties of diverse transition&#8208;metal compounds with higher accuracy and versatility compared to many other commonly used descriptors. A fresh path is thus opened for rational design and optimization of these compounds with tailored performance benchmarks.








Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal light&#8208;element compounds show superb mechanical, chemical, and thermal properties, and accurate descriptors are important to sorting targeted properties among this vast class of materials. Valence electron concentration (VEC) can track broad trends of mechanical properties, but this widely used descriptor suffers low accuracy with sorted data strongly scattered along trendlines, necessitating an improved sorting strategy. Here, elastic parameters from first&#8208;principles calculations are examined for 81 ternary transition&#8208;metal nitrides (TMN) in cubic structure and 81 ternary transition&#8208;metal diborides (TMB2) in hexagonal structure and identify core electron count (CEC) of the solvent atoms as a new descriptor. Combined with VEC, the composite VEC&#8211;CEC descriptor exhibits greatly improved ability to sort elastic parameters of distinct TMN and TMB2 compounds. Unregulated property variations under the VEC description are well&#8208;captured by CEC, which tends to enhance ductility and reduce strength at fixed VEC and rising CEC. By invoking a full&#8208;electron consideration, the VEC&#8211;CEC descriptor accounts for the impact on bonding behaviors by both core and valence electrons with much&#8208;improved accuracy and versatility in sorting mechanical properties of diverse TM compounds compared to many other commonly used descriptors, opening a fresh path for rational design and optimization of TM compounds with tailored performance benchmarks.

         <title>Stabilizing Precursor Solution and Controlling Crystallization Kinetics Simultaneously for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is found that the TFFH additive can inhibit the oxidation of I&#8722;, eliminating I0, Pb0, and uncoordinated Pb2+ defects and control crystallization kinetics by the strong FA+&#183;&#183;&#183;TFFH&#183;&#183;&#183;Pb&#9472;I interaction. Simultaneous regulation of precursor solution and crystallization dynamics mean the optimized solar cells achieve improved reproducibility and stability, and reach an efficiency of 42.43% at illumination of 1002 lux.








Abstract
The efficiency of metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has skyrocketed; however, defects created by aging precursor solutions and during crystallization pose a significant barrier to the reproducibility and efficiency of solar cells. In this work, fluoro&#8208;N,N,N&#8243;,N&#8243;&#8208;tetramethylformamidinium hexafluorophosphate (F&#8208;(CH3)4CN2PF6, abbreviated as TFFH) is introduced to stabilize precursor solution and improve crystallization dynamics simultaneously for high&#8208;performance formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3)&#8208;based perovskite indoor photovoltaics. The TFFH stabilizes the precursor solution by inhibiting oxidation of I&#8722; and reducing newly generated I0 to I&#8722;, and passivates undercoordinated Pb2+ by interacting with the Pb&#9472;I framework. Time&#8208;resolved optical diagnostics show prolonged perovskite crystallization dynamics and in situ defect passivation due to the presence of strong FA+&#183;&#183;&#183;TFFH&#183;&#183;&#183;Pb&#9472;I interaction. Simultaneous regulation of precursor solution and crystallization dynamics guarantee larger perovskite grain sizes, better crystal orientation, fewer defects and more efficient charge extraction in PSCs. The optimized PSCs achieve improved reproducibility and better stability and reach an efficiency of 42.43% at illumination of 1002 lux, which is the highest efficiency among all indoor photovoltaics. It is anticipated that the concurrent stabilization of solutions and regulation of crystallization dynamics will emerge as a prevalent approach for enhancing the reproducibility and efficiency of perovskite.

&lt;p&gt;It is found that the TFFH additive can inhibit the oxidation of I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, eliminating I&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;, Pb&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;, and uncoordinated Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; defects and control crystallization kinetics by the strong FA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&#183;&#183;&#183;TFFH&#183;&#183;&#183;Pb&#9472;I interaction. Simultaneous regulation of precursor solution and crystallization dynamics mean the optimized solar cells achieve improved reproducibility and stability, and reach an efficiency of 42.43% at illumination of 1002 lux.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The efficiency of metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has skyrocketed; however, defects created by aging precursor solutions and during crystallization pose a significant barrier to the reproducibility and efficiency of solar cells. In this work, fluoro-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8243;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8243;-tetramethylformamidinium hexafluorophosphate (F-(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;CN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, abbreviated as TFFH) is introduced to stabilize precursor solution and improve crystallization dynamics simultaneously for high-performance formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)-based perovskite indoor photovoltaics. The TFFH stabilizes the precursor solution by inhibiting oxidation of I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and reducing newly generated I&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; to I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, and passivates undercoordinated Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; by interacting with the Pb&#9472;I framework. Time-resolved optical diagnostics show prolonged perovskite crystallization dynamics and in situ defect passivation due to the presence of strong FA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&#183;&#183;&#183;TFFH&#183;&#183;&#183;Pb&#9472;I interaction. Simultaneous regulation of precursor solution and crystallization dynamics guarantee larger perovskite grain sizes, better crystal orientation, fewer defects and more efficient charge extraction in PSCs. The optimized PSCs achieve improved reproducibility and better stability and reach an efficiency of 42.43% at illumination of 1002 lux, which is the highest efficiency among all indoor photovoltaics. It is anticipated that the concurrent stabilization of solutions and regulation of crystallization dynamics will emerge as a prevalent approach for enhancing the reproducibility and efficiency of perovskite.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A universal strategy to enhance long&#8208;persistent luminescence (LPL) performance of organic host&#8211;guest doping systems by UV curing is reported, by which amorphous organic LPL materials show broader application prospects.








Abstract
Amorphous organic long&#8208;persistent luminescence materials (OLPLMs) can realize simpler solution processing and large&#8208;area uniform luminescence, where the luminescent properties are significantly influenced by the rigid environment. However, research on utilizing the rigidity to promote long&#8208;persistent luminescence (LPL) properties of amorphous OLPLMs is still relatively rare due to the lack of an unambiguous and effective strategy to construct the rigid environment. Here, a universal strategy is proposed to enhance the LPL performance of organic host&#8211;guest doping systems by UV curing, which utilizes the rigid environment constructed by UV curing to promote the interaction between host and guest, thus inducing a generation of materials with highly efficient LPL performance. This solution&#8208;processable, large&#8208;area, and &#8220;easy&#8208;to&#8208;realize&#8221; material fabrication strategy can make amorphous OLPLMs show broader application prospects in some fields, such as anti&#8208;counterfeiting, nondestructive detection, and pattern marking or indication.

         <title>Achieving a Record Scintillation Performance by Micro&#8208;Doping a Heterovalent Magnetic Ion in Cs3Cu2I5 Single&#8208;Crystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Micro&#8208;doping of magnetic Mn2+ ions in Cs3Cu2I5 single&#8208;crystal can regulate the emission of self&#8208;trapped excitons under high&#8208;energy ray excitation, solving its drawback of slow scintillation decay. This optimization makes the crystal an ideal scintillator for ultrafast, ultrabright, and low&#8208;cost scintillation with significant application prospects.








Abstract
An ultrabright, ultrafast, and low&#8208;cost ideal scintillator has been critically absent and is sorely desired in scintillation detection, but has hitherto not been found. Here, a high&#8208;quality bulk Cs3Cu2I5:Mn single&#8208;crystal scintillator with ultrahigh light yield (&#8776;95&#8239;772 photons&#160;per&#160;MeV, 137Cs &#947;&#8208;rays), excellent energy resolution (3.79%, 662&#160;keV), and ultrafast scintillation decay time (3&#160;ns, 81.5%) is reported. In mechanism, it is found that micro&#8208;doping of a heterovalent magnetic ion (at the ppm level) can effectively modulate the luminescence kinetics of self&#8208;trapped excitons in the scintillator. Compared with previous reports, the introduction of trace amounts of magnetic Mn2+ (&#8776;18.6&#160;ppm) in Cs3Cu2I5 single&#8208;crystal shortens the scintillation decay time by several hundred times, transforming the slow decay into an ultrafast decay. Simultaneously, the light yield is also increased about three times&#160;to the highest value so far. From the comprehensive performance of the micro&#8208;doped Cs3Cu2I5:Mn single&#8208;crystal, these excellent scintillation properties, physical characteristics suitable for practical applications, and low&#8208;cost advantages render this single&#8208;crystal an ideal scintillator with great potential for commercialization.

         <title>Rational Design of Orally Administered Cascade Nanozyme for Inflammatory Bowel Disease Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Materials Project is used as a candidate database to establish a rational nine&#8208;tier high&#8208;throughput screening method for multifaceted therapeutic demands for IBD. Ni3S4 is selected as the best matching nanozyme, with 3.13&#8208; and 1.80&#8208;fold higher activity than natural superoxide dismutase and catalase, respectively, and its therapeutic effectiveness is demonstrated using in vitro and in vivo anti&#8208;inflammatory models.








Abstract
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) affects millions of individuals worldwide annually. Enteric reactive oxygen species (ROS) play critical roles in the physiology and pathology of IBD. Nanozymes hold great promise for the treatment of IBD because of their exceptional ability to regulate redox homeostasis during ROS&#8208;related inflammation. However, the rapid development of orally administered, acid&#8208;tolerant, antioxidant nanozymes for IBD therapy is challenging. Here, a nine&#8208;tier high&#8208;throughput screening strategy is established to address the multifaceted IBD treatment demands, including intrinsic stability, radioactivity, solubility, gut microbiome toxicity, biomimetic elements, intermediate frontier molecular orbitals, reaction energy barriers, negative charges, and acid tolerance. Ni3S4 is selected as the best matching material from 146&#160;323 candidates, which exhibits superoxide dismutase&#8208;catalase bienzyme&#8208;like activity and is 3.13&#8208; and 1.80&#8208;fold more active than natural enzymes. As demonstrated in a mouse model, Ni3S4 is stable in the gastrointestinal tract without toxicity and specifically targets the diseased colon to alleviate oxidative stress. RNA and 16S rRNA sequencing analyses show that Ni3S4 effectively inhibits the cellular pathways of pro&#8208;inflammatory factors and restores the gut microbiota. This study not develops a highly efficient orally administered cascade nanozyme for IBD therapy and offers a next&#8208;generation paradigm for the rational design of nanomedicine through data&#8208;driven approaches.

         <title>A Redox&#8208;Active Covalent Organic Framework with Highly Accessible Aniline&#8208;Fused Quinonoid Units Affords Efficient Proton Charge Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A redox&#8208;active 2D covalent organic framework (TPAD&#8208;COF)&#8208;based cathode&#160;with aniline&#8208;fused quinonoids for proton batteries is developed. The assembled TPAD&#8208;COF//AQ all&#8208;organic proton battery exhibits excellent cycling performance. Comprehensive ex situ spectroscopy studies correlated with theoretical&#160;calculations reveal that both the NH and C=O groups of the aniline&#8208;fused quinonoids exhibit prominent redox activity of six electrons during the charge/discharge processes.








Abstract
Owing to their intrinsic safety and sustainability, aqueous proton batteries have emerged as promising energy devices. Nevertheless, the corrosion or dissolution of electrode materials in acidic electrolytes must be addressed before practical applications. In this study, a cathode material based on a redox&#8208;active 2D covalent organic framework (TPAD&#8208;COF) with aniline&#8208;fused quinonoid units&#160;featuring inherently regular open porous channels and excellent stability is developed. The TPAD&#8208;COF cathode delivers a high capacity of 126 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.2 A g&#8722;1, paired with long&#8208;term cycling stability with capacity retention of 84% after 5000 cycles at 2 A g&#8722;1. Comprehensive ex situ spectroscopy studies correlated with density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that both the &#8211;NH&#8211; and C=O groups of the aniline&#8208;fused quinonoid units exhibit prominent redox activity of six electrons during the charge/discharge processes. Furthermore, the assembled punch battery consisting of a TPAD&#8208;COF//anthraquinone (AQ) all&#8208;organic system delivers a discharge capacity of 115 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 A g&#8722;1 after 130 cycles, implying the potential application of the TPAD&#8208;COF cathode in aqueous proton batteries. This study provides a new perspective on the design of electrode materials for aqueous proton batteries with long&#8208;term cycling performance and high capacity.

&lt;p&gt;A redox-active 2D covalent organic framework (TPAD-COF)-based cathode&#160;with aniline-fused quinonoids for proton batteries is developed. The assembled TPAD-COF//AQ all-organic proton battery exhibits excellent cycling performance. Comprehensive ex situ spectroscopy studies correlated with theoretical&#160;calculations reveal that both the NH and C=O groups of the aniline-fused quinonoids exhibit prominent redox activity of six electrons during the charge/discharge processes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owing to their intrinsic safety and sustainability, aqueous proton batteries have emerged as promising energy devices. Nevertheless, the corrosion or dissolution of electrode materials in acidic electrolytes must be addressed before practical applications. In this study, a cathode material based on a redox-active 2D covalent organic framework (TPAD-COF) with aniline-fused quinonoid units&#160;featuring inherently regular open porous channels and excellent stability is developed. The TPAD-COF cathode delivers a high capacity of 126 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.2 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, paired with long-term cycling stability with capacity retention of 84% after 5000 cycles at 2 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Comprehensive ex situ spectroscopy studies correlated with density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that both the &#8211;NH&#8211; and C=O groups of the aniline-fused quinonoid units exhibit prominent redox activity of six electrons during the charge/discharge processes. Furthermore, the assembled punch battery consisting of a TPAD-COF//anthraquinone (AQ) all-organic system delivers a discharge capacity of 115 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.5 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 130 cycles, implying the potential application of the TPAD-COF cathode in aqueous proton batteries. This study provides a new perspective on the design of electrode materials for aqueous proton batteries with long-term cycling performance and high capacity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Bacteriochlorin Nanosheet as a Specific Pyroptosis Inducer for Robust Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper&#8208;bacteriochlorin nanosheets as a specific pyroptosis inducer exhibit the ability to induce both Cu+&#8208;driven cascade reactions and photodynamic therapy to produce potent reactive oxygen species, leading to pyroptosis of primary tumors while promoting dendritic cell maturation and T cell activation, thereby enhancing tumor immunogenicity for inhibiting the distant tumor growth and metastases with minimal systemic side effects.








Abstract
Pyroptosis is increasingly considered a new weathervane in cancer immune therapy. However, triggering specific pyroptotic tumor cell death while preserving normal cells still remains a major challenge. Herein, a brand&#8208;new pyroptosis inducer, copper&#8208;bacteriochlorin nanosheet (Cu&#8208;TBB), is designed. The synthesized Cu&#8208;TBB can&#160;be activated to an &#8220;on&#8221; state in the tumor microenvironment with glutathione (GSH) overexpression, leading to the release of Cu+ and TBB, respectively. Intriguingly, the released Cu+ can&#160;drive cascade reactions to produce O2&#8722;&#8226; and highly toxic &#183;OH in cells. Additionally, the released TBB can&#160;also generate O2&#8722;&#8226; and 1O2 upon 750&#160;nm laser irradiation. Encouragingly, both Cu+&#8208;driven cascade reactions and photodynamic therapy pathways result in potent pyroptosis along with dendritic cell maturation and T cell priming, thus simultaneously eliminating the primary tumors and inhibiting the distant tumor growth and metastases. Conclusively, the well&#8208;designed Cu&#8208;TBB nanosheet is shown to trigger specific pyroptosis in vitro&#160;and&#160;in vivo, leading to enhanced tumor immunogenicity and antitumor efficacy while minimizing systemic side effects.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Self&#8208;Assembled Hydroxyl Radical Generator Based on Photoinduced Cascade Electron Transfer for Hypoxic Tumor Phototherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a series of hydroxyl radical (&#8226;OH) generators (ANOR&#8208;Cy5) that are activated by near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light, capable of forming nanoparticles in aqueous solutions. The generation of &#8226;OH is accomplished with high efficiency through photoinduced cascade electron transfer pathways within the self&#8208;assembled molecular state. Consequently, ANOR&#8208;Cy5 exhibits exceptional efficacy in inducing photoablation of hypoxic tumors.








Abstract
The hydroxyl radical (&#8226;OH) is an extremely potent reactive oxygen species that plays a crucial role in photooxidations within the realm of hypoxic tumor therapy. However, the current methods for &#8226;OH photogeneration typically rely on inorganic materials that require UV/vis light excitation. Consequently, photogenerators based on organic molecules, especially those utilizing near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light excitation, are rare. In this study, the concept of photoinduced cascade charge transfer (PICET), which utilizes NIR heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free photosensitizers (ANOR&#8208;Cy5) to generate &#8226;OH is introduced. The ANOR&#8208;Cy5 photosensitizer, with its flexible hydrophobic structure, enables the formation of nanoparticles in aqueous solutions through molecular assembly. PICET involves a symmetry&#8208;breaking charge separation&#8208;induced localized charge&#8208;separated state, transitioning to a delocalized charge&#8208;separated state, which governs the efficiency of &#8226;OH generation. Thanks to the oxygen&#8208;independent nature of &#8226;OH generation and its robust oxidative properties, the ANOR&#8208;Cy5&#8208;based photosensitizer demonstrates highly effective photoinduced anti&#8208;cancer effects, even under severely hypoxic conditions. This discovery emphasizes the potential for achieving &#8226;OH photogeneration using a single organic molecule through the engineering of molecular self&#8208;assembly, thereby opening up new possibilities for phototherapy and beyond.

         <title>Inhibited Grain Growth Through Phase Transition Modulation Enables Excellent Mechanical Properties in Oxide Ceramic Nanofibers up to 1700&#160;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phase transition modulation strategy is proposed to prepare oxide ceramic nanofibers, which are featured by inhibited grain growth at high temperatures. As a result, a strikingly high average tensile strength of 1.02&#160;GPa is achieved at 1700&#160;&#176;C, laying a basis for developing advanced oxide ceramics for reliable thermal protection in extremely high&#8208;temperature environments.








Abstract
Oxide ceramics are widely used as thermal protection materials due to their excellent structural properties and earth abundance. However, in extremely high&#8208;temperature environments (above 1500&#160;&#176;C), the explosive growth of grain size causes irreversible damage to the microstructure of oxide ceramics, thus exhibiting poor thermomechanical stability. This problem, which may lead to catastrophic accidents, remains a great challenge for oxide ceramic materials. Here, a novel strategy of phase transition modulation is proposed to control the grain growth at high temperatures in oxide ceramic nanofibers, realizing effective regulation of the crystalline forms as well as the size uniformity of primary grains, and thus suppressing the malignant growth of the grains. The resulting oxide ceramic nanofibers have excellent mechanical strength and flexibility, delivering an average tensile strength as high as 1.02&#160;GPa after being exposed to 1700&#160;&#176;C for 30&#160;min, and can withstand thousands of flexural cycles without obvious damage. This work may provide new insight into the development of advanced oxide ceramic materials that can serve in extremely high&#8208;temperature environments with long&#8208;term durability.

         <title>Dual Breaking of Molecular Orbitals and Spatial Symmetry in an Optically Controlled Ferroelectric</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual breaking of molecular orbitals and spatial symmetry enables the optical control of two ferroelectric states between the closed&#8208;ring and open&#8208;ring forms of a photochromic organic ferroelectric, which is an unprecedented mechanism in ferroelectrics and brings a new paradigm for manipulating ferroelectric polarization. 








Abstract
As particles carry quantified energy, photon radiation enables orbital transitions of energy levels, leading to changes in the spin state of electrons. The resulting switchable structural bistability may bring a new paradigm for manipulating ferroelectric polarization. However, the studies on molecular orbital breaking in the ferroelectric field remain blank. Here, for the first time, a new mechanism of ferroelectrics&#8212;dual breaking of molecular orbitals and spatial symmetry, demonstrated in a photochromic organic crystal with light&#8208;induced polarization switching, is formally proposed. By alternating the ultraviolet/visible light irradiation, the states of electron spin and the radial distribution p atomic orbitals experience a change, showing a reversible switch from &#8220;shoulder&#8208;to&#8208;shoulder&#8221; form to a &#8220;head&#8208;to&#8208;head&#8221; form. This reflects a reversible conversion between &#960; and &#963; bonds, which induces and couples with the variation of spatial symmetry. The intersection of spatial symmetry breaking and molecular orbital breaking in ferroelectrics present in this work will be more conducive to data encryption and anticounterfeiting.

         <title>Regulating Exciton De&#8208;Trapping of Te4+&#8208;Doped Zero&#8208;Dimensional Scandium&#8208;Halide Perovskite for Fluorescence Thermometry with Record High Time&#8208;Resolved Thermal Sensitivity</title>

         <dc:description>
An ultrasensitive fluorescence thermometer is developed by Te4+&#8208;doped 0D Cs2ScCl5&#183;H2O engineering. The rapid de&#8208;trapping process of self&#8208;trapped excitons induced by the soft lattice results in a record high thermal sensitivity for the lifetime&#8208;based detection, reaching up to 27.36% K&#8722;1 at 325 K, with the temperature uncertainty below 0.1 K, enabling remote local monitoring of operating temperature on internal electronic components.








Abstract
Fluorescence thermometry has been propelled to the forefront of scientific attention due to its high spatial resolution and remote non&#8208;invasive detection. However, recent generations of thermometers still suffer from limited thermal sensitivity (Sr) below 10% change per Kelvin. Herein, this work presents an ideal temperature&#8208;responsive fluorescence material through Te4+&#8208;doped 0D Cs2ScCl5&#183;H2O, in which isolated polyhedrons endow highly localized electronic structures, and the strong electron&#8211;phonon coupling facilitates the formation of self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs). With rising temperature, the dramatic asymmetric expansion of the soft lattice induces increased defects, strong exciton&#8211;phonon coupling, and low thermal activation energy, which evokes a rapid de&#8208;trapping process of STEs, enabling several orders of magnitude changes in the fluorescence lifetime over a narrow temperature range. After regulating the de&#8208;trapping process with different Te4+ doping, a record&#8208;high Sr (27.36% K&#8722;1) of fluorescence lifetime&#8208;based detection is achieved at 325 K. The robust stability against multiple heating/cooling cycles and long&#8208;term measurements enables a low temperature uncertainty of 0.067 K. Further, the developed thermometers are demonstrated for the remote local monitoring of operating temperature on internal electronic components. It is believed that this work constitutes a solid step towards building the next generation of ultrasensitive thermometers based on low&#8208;dimensional metal halides.

         <title>Nanozyme&#8208;Cosmetic Contact Lenses for Ocular Surface Disease Prevention</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multicolor Prussian blue family nanozymes with antioxidant abilities are embedded into cosmetic contact lenses to prevent ocular surface diseases, minimize potential safety risks, and protect corneas from external stimulation and underlying systemic diseases via reactive oxygen species scavenging.








Abstract
Efficiently balancing excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) caused by various factors on the ocular surface is a promising strategy for preventing the development of ocular surface diseases (OSDs). Nevertheless, the conventional topical administration of antioxidants is limited in efficacy due to poor absorption, rapid metabolism, and irreversible depletion, which impede their performance. To address this issue, contact lenses embedded with antioxidant nanozymes that can continuously scavenge ROS, thereby providing an excellent preventive effect against OSDs are developed. Specifically, Prussian blue family nanozymes are chosen based on their multiple antioxidant enzyme&#8208;like activities and excellent biocompatibility. The diverse range of colors made them promising candidates for the development of cosmetic contact lenses (CCLs) as a substitute for conventional pigments. The efficacy of nanozyme&#8208;CCLs is demonstrated in rabbits and rats exposed to a high risk of developing OSDs. These OSDs' prevention nanozyme&#8208;CCLs can pave the way for CCLs toward powerful wearable biomedical devices and provide novel strategies for the rational utilization of nanomaterials in clinical practice.

         <title>Ductile Oligomeric Acceptor&#8208;Modified Flexible Organic Solar Cells Show Excellent Mechanical Robustness and Near 18% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oligomeric acceptors with different flexible alkyl chains (DOY&#8208;C2, DOY&#8208;C4, and TOY&#8208;C4) are synthesized. When doped into D18:N3 system, outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.01% and 17.91% are achieved in rigid and flexible devices based on D18:N3:DOY&#8208;C4, respectively. In addition, the mechanical properties of ternary films are also successfully improved due to form tie and entangled chain networks.








Abstract
High power conversion efficiency (PCE) and mechanical robustness are key requirements for wearable applications of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, almost all highly efficient photoactive films comprising polymer donors (PD) and small molecule acceptors (SMAs) are mechanically brittle. In this study, highly efficient (PCE = 17.91%) and mechanically robust (crack&#8208;onset strain [COS] = 11.7%) flexible OSCs are fabricated by incorporating a ductile oligomeric acceptor (DOA) into the PD:SMA system, representing the most flexible OSCs to date. The photophysical, mechanical, and photovoltaic properties of D18:N3 with different DOAs are characterized. By introducing DOA DOY&#8208;C4 with a longer flexible alkyl linker and lower polymerization, the D18:N3:DOY&#8208;C4&#8208;based flexible OSCs exhibit a significantly higher PCE (17.91%) and 50% higher COS (11.7%) than the D18:N3&#8208;based device (PCE = 17.06%, COS = 7.8%). The flexible OSCs based on D18:N3:DOY&#8208;C4 retain 98% of the initial PCE after 2000 consecutive bending cycles, showing greater mechanical stability than the reference device (maintaining 89% of initial PCE). After careful investigation, it is hypothesized that the enhancement in mechanical properties is mainly due to the formation of tie chains or entanglement in the ternary blend films. These results demonstrate that DOAs have great potential for achieving high&#8208;performance flexible OSCs.

         <title>Mechano&#8208;Driven Tribo&#8208;Electrophoresis Enabled Human&#8211;Droplet Interaction in 3D Space</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel human&#8211;droplet interaction platform rooted in the TEP approach is demonstrated, eliminating the need for complex electrodes and external power sources. By employing a well&#8208;designed triboelectric nanogenerator&#8211;electrostatic tweezer, precise and flexible manipulation of droplets in 3D space is achieved through human motion, fostering enhanced synergy and flexibility between humans and droplets.








Abstract
Electronically controlled droplet manipulation has widespread applications in biochemistry, life sciences, and industry. However, current technologies such as electrowetting, electrostatics, and surface charge printing rely on complex electrode arrays and external power supplies, leading to inefficient manipulation. In light of these limitations, a novel method is proposed, which&#160;leverages tribo&#8208;electrophoresis (TEP) to pipette in an oil medium, thereby enabling human&#8211;droplet interactions to be constructed with greater efficiency. The approach involves the rational design of a triboelectric nanogenerator&#8211;electrostatic tweezer&#160;that generates an electric field to charge the droplet and improves the maneuverability of the charged droplet, including aligned/non&#8208;aligned pipetting and stable transport in the clamped state, which can be accomplished solely by hand motion. The TEP method not only provides droplets with freedom to move in three dimensions but also offers a feasibility case for chemical reactions in the liquid phase and non&#8208;invasive sample extraction. This breakthrough establishes a cornerstone for human&#8211;droplet interactions capitalized on triboelectric nanogenerators, opening new avenues for research in droplet manipulation.

2D Dion&#8211;Jacobson phase perovskite BDASnI4 is identified to be promising for constructing high&#8211;performance field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs). By developing interface and additive engineering strategies, BDASnI4 FETs achieve mobility of 1.61 cm2 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1. Moreover, the devices remain functional after being exposed to ambient conditions (temperature of 45 &#8451; and humidity of 45%) for over 150 h.&#160; 








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed metal halide perovskites hold immense potential for the advancement of next&#8208;generation field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs). However, the instability of perovskite&#8208;based transistors has impeded their progress and practical applications. Here, ambient&#8208;stable high&#8208;performance FETs based on 2D Dion&#8211;Jacobson phase tin halide perovskite BDASnI4, which has high film quality and excellent electrical properties, are reported. The perovskite channels are established by engineering the film crystallization process via the employment of ammonium salt interlayers and the incorporation of NH4SCN additives within the precursor solution. The refined FETs demonstrate field&#8208;effect hole mobilities up to 1.61 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and an on/off ratio surpassing 106. Moreover, the devices show impressive operational and environmental stability and retain their functional performance even after being exposed to ambient conditions with a temperature of 45 &#176;C and humidity of 45% for over 150 h.

         <title>Fast Gas&#8208;Adsorption Kinetics in Supraparticle&#8208;Based MOF Packings with Hierarchical Porosity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macroscopic metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#160;adsorbents with a multilevel hierarchical pore structure consisting of interconnected pore networks at three distinct length scales (&gt;1000, &#8776;100, and &#8776;1 nm) exhibit efficient mass transport. These materials can be self&#8208;assembled using supraparticles formed with nanoscale ZIF&#8208;8 primary particles as intermediate building blocks and exhibit 30 times faster adsorption kinetics compared to their unstructured analogs.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are microporous adsorbents for high&#8208;throughput gas separation. Such materials exhibit distinct adsorption characteristics owing to the flexibility of the crystal framework in a nanoparticle, which can be different from its bulk crystal. However, for practical applications, such particles need to be compacted into macroscopic pellets, creating mass&#8208;transport limitations. In this work, this problem is addressed by forming materials with structural hierarchy, using a supraparticle&#8208;based approach. Spherical supraparticles composed of nanosized MOF particles are fabricated by emulsion templating and they are used as the structural component forming a macroscopic material. Zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) particles are used as a model system and the gas&#8208;adsorption kinetics of the hierarchical material are compared with conventional pellets without structural hierarchy. It is demonstrated that a pellet packed with supraparticles exhibits a 30 times faster adsorption rate compared to an unstructured ZIF&#8208;8 powder pellet. These results underline the importance of controlling structural hierarchy to maximize the performance of existing materials. In the hierarchical MOFs, large macropores between the supraparticles, smaller macropores between individual ZIF&#8208;8 primary particles, and micropores inherent to the ZIF&#8208;8 framework collude to combine large surface area, defined adsorption sites, and efficient mass transport to enhance performance.

         <title>Sub&#8208;Nanosecond Reconfiguration of Ferroelectric Domains in Bismuth Ferrite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon pulsed photoexcitation, multiferroic bismuth ferrite thin film exhibits a sub&#8208;nanosecond melting of their periodic stripe domains. The disordered domains recover back to their original state over few nanosecond timescale. The ultrafast manipulation of domains can be used for fast speed operation in applications of ferroelectrics.








Abstract
Domain switching is crucial for achieving desired functions in ferroic materials that are used in various applications. Fast control of domains at sub&#8208;nanosecond timescales remains a challenge despite its potential for high&#8208;speed operation in random&#8208;access memories, photonic, and nanoelectronic devices. Here, ultrafast laser excitation is shown to transiently melt and reconfigure ferroelectric stripe domains in multiferroic bismuth ferrite on a timescale faster than 100&#160;picoseconds. This dynamic behavior is visualized by picosecond&#8208; and nanometer&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray diffraction and time&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray diffuse scattering. The disordering of stripe domains is attributed to the screening of depolarization fields by photogenerated carriers resulting in the formation of charged domain walls, as supported by phase&#8208;field simulations. Furthermore, the recovery of disordered domains exhibits subdiffusive growth on nanosecond timescales, with a non&#8208;equilibrium domain velocity reaching up to 10&#160;m&#160;s&#8722;1. These findings present a new approach to image and manipulate ferroelectric domains on sub&#8208;nanosecond timescales, which can be further extended into other complex photoferroic systems to modulate their electronic, optical, and magnetic properties beyond gigahertz frequencies. This approach could pave the way for high&#8208;speed ferroelectric data storage and computing, and, more broadly, defines new approaches for visualizing the non&#8208;equilibrium dynamics of heterogeneous and disordered materials.

         <title>Boosting Oxygen Evolution Reaction of (Fe,Ni)OOH via Defect Engineering for Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis Under Industrial Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Defect&#8208;rich d&#8208;(Fe,Ni)OOH catalyst is prepared through an energy&#8208;saving cation exchange method. It exhibits good catalytic durability and structural stability for large&#8208;scale alkaline water oxidation under industrial conditions. When coupled with NiMoN and assembled in an anion exchange membrane electrolyzer, the large&#8208;area d&#8208;(Fe,Ni)OOH&#8208;NiMoN pair shows outstanding overall water electrolysis performance.








Abstract
Developing non&#8208;precious catalysts with long&#8208;term catalytic durability and structural stability under industrial conditions is the key to practical alkaline anion exchange membrane (AEM) water electrolysis. Here, an energy&#8208;saving approach is proposed to synthesize defect&#8208;rich iron nickel oxyhydroxide for stability and efficiency toward the oxygen evolution reaction. Benefiting from in situ cation exchange, the nanosheet&#8208;nanoflake&#8208;structured catalyst is homogeneously embedded in, and tightly bonded to, its substrate, making it ultrastable at high current densities. Experimental and theoretical calculation results reveal that the introduction of Ni in FeOOH reduces the activation energy barrier for the catalytic reaction and that the purposely created oxygen defects not only ensure the exposure of active sites and maximize the effective catalyst surface but also modulate the local coordination environment and chemisorption properties of both Fe and Ni sites, thus lowering the energy barrier from *O to *OOH. Consequently, the optimized d&#8208;(Fe,Ni)OOH catalyst exhibits outstanding catalytic activity with long&#8208;term durability under both laboratory and industrial conditions. The large&#8208;area d&#8208;(Fe,Ni)OOH||NiMoN pair requires 1.795&#160;V to reach a current density of 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at an absolute current of 12.5 A in an AEM electrolyzer for overall water electrolysis, showing great potential for industrial water electrolysis.

         <title>Liquids with High Compressibility</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conventional liquids are barely compressible. However, here, a simple strategy is presented to increase the compressibility of aqueous liquids by dispersing into them small particles of porous materials with empty hydrophobic pores. The total compression is due to compression of the interparticle water phase in addition to water&#160;being forced into the pores, and the resulting compressibility is up to 20 times that of conventional liquids.








Abstract
Compressibility is a fundamental property of all materials. For fluids, that is, gases and liquids, compressibility forms the basis of technologies such as pneumatics and hydraulics and determines basic phenomena such as the propagation of sound and shock waves. In contrast to gases, liquids are almost incompressible. If the compressibility of liquids could be increased and controlled, new applications in hydraulics and shock absorption could result. Here, it is shown that dispersing hydrophobic porous particles into water gives aqueous suspensions with much greater compressibilities than any normal liquids such as water (specifically, up to 20 times greater over certain pressure ranges). The increased compressibility results from water molecules being forced into the hydrophobic pores of the particles under applied pressure. The degree of compression can be controlled by varying the amount of porous particles added. Also, the pressure range of compression can be reduced by adding methanol or increased by adding salt. In all cases, the liquids expand back to their original volume when the applied pressure is released. The approach shown here is simple and economical and could potentially be scaled up to give large amounts of highly compressible liquids.

&lt;p&gt;Conventional liquids are barely compressible. However, here, a simple strategy is presented to increase the compressibility of aqueous liquids by dispersing into them small particles of porous materials with empty hydrophobic pores. The total compression is due to compression of the interparticle water phase in addition to water&#160;being forced into the pores, and the resulting compressibility is up to 20 times that of conventional liquids.

&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Hetero&#8208;Polyionic Hydrogels Enable Dendrites&#8208;Free Aqueous Zn&#8208;I2 Batteries with Fast Kinetics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hetero&#8208;polyionic hydrogel electrolyte is developed to realize cycle&#8208;stable Zn&#8208;I2 batteries with fast kinetics. Polyanionic hydrogel with high zincophilicity uniformizes Zn2+ flux and retards polyiodides/SO42&#8211; transport, leading to a dendrite&#8208;free and corrosion&#8208;free Zn anode. Iodophilic polycationic hydrogel alleviates the shuttling of polyiodides and boosts the reaction kinetics at hydrogel/carbon interface for iodine species.








Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous Zn&#8208;I2 batteries (ZIB) are regarded as a promising energy storage candidate. However, soluble polyiodide shuttling and rampant Zn dendrite growth hamper its commercial implementation. Herein, a hetero&#8208;polyionic hydrogel is designed as the electrolyte for ZIBs. On the cathode side, iodophilic polycationic hydrogel (PCH) effectively alleviates the shuttle effect and facilitates the redox kinetics of iodine species. Meanwhile, polyanionic hydrogel (PAH) toward Zn metal anode uniformizes Zn2+ flux and prevents surface corrosion by electrostatic repulsion of polyiodides. Consequently, the Zn symmetric cells with PAH electrolyte demonstrate remarkable cycling stability over 3000&#160;h at 1&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 (1 mAh cm&#8211;2) and 800&#160;h at 10&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 (5 mAh cm&#8211;2). Moreover, the Zn&#8208;I2 full cells with PAH&#8208;PCH hetero&#8208;polyionic hydrogel electrolyte deliver a low&#8208;capacity decay of 0.008 &#8240; per cycle during 18&#160;000 cycles at 8 C. This work sheds light on hydrogel electrolytes design for long&#8208;life conversion&#8208;type aqueous batteries.

         <title>Activating Selenium Cathode Chemistry for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

Ru&#8208;doped amorphous Se (abbreviated as &#945;&#8208;Ru0.14Se) is successfully prepared via a facile hydrothermal method for advanced cathodes of aqueous rechargeable zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ARZIBs). Benefiting from synergistic doping and amorphization strategy, the resulting &#945;&#8208;Ru0.14Se||Zn battery displays record&#8208;high capacity and exceptional cyclability. Such novel electrode chemistry of &#945;&#8208;Ru0.14Se with both intercalation/deintercalation and deposition/stripping mechanisms opens new opportunities for next&#8208;generation ARZIBs.








Abstract
Aqueous rechargeable zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ARZIBs) are a promising next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;storage device by virtue of the superior safety and low cost of both the aqueous electrolyte and zinc&#8208;metal anode. However, their development is hindered by the lack of suitable cathodes with high volumetric capacity that can provide both lightweight and compact size. Herein, a novel cathode chemistry based on amorphous Se doped with transition metal Ru that mitigates the resistive surface layer produced by the side reactions between the Se cathode and aqueous electrolyte is reported. This improvement can permit high volumetric capacity in this system. Distinct from the conventional conversion mechanisms between Se and ZnSe in Se||Zn cells, this strategy realizes synchronous proton and Zn2+ intercalation/deintercalation in the Ru&#8208;doped amorphous Se||Zn half cells. Moreover, an unanticipated Zn2+ deposition/stripping process in this system further contributes to the superior electrochemical performance of this new cathode chemistry. Consequently, the Ru&#8208;doped amorphous Se||Zn half cells are found to deliver a record&#8208;high capacity of 721&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1/3472&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;3, and superior cycling stability of over 800 cycles with only 0.015% capacity decay per cycle. This reported work opens the door for new chemistries that can further improve the gravimetric and volumetric capacity of ARZIBs.

         <title>Donor&#8211;Acceptor&#8211;Donor Triads with Flexible Spacers: Deciphering Complex Photophysics for Targeted Materials Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The complex photokinetics of donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor triads are deciphered for practical use in materials science. In solution, fluorescent exciplexes are formed only for the short spacer (n = 4). Upon freezing, emissive static charge transfer (CT) complexes are formed for all spacer lengths. The molecular solids are stimuli&#8208;responsive, showing on/off fluorescence switching (n &gt; 4) or change of the emission color (n = 4).








Abstract
The complex photokinetics of donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor triads with varying flexible spacer lengths (n = 4&#8211;10 carbon atoms) are investigated in liquid and solid solution, as well as in crystals, by steady&#8208;state and transient fluorescence spectroscopy combined with computational studies. For the short spacer (n = 4) in a liquid solution, dynamic charge&#8208;transfer (CT) state formation with subsequent, efficient exciplex emission is observed, effectively competing with quenching through electron transfer (eT) via a radical ion pair. In a solid solution, a fluorescent CT static complex is formed upon freezing for all spacer lengths. This allows the observations of a former seminal report on stimuli&#8208;responsive high&#8208;contrast fluorescence on/off switching in films of the triads to be reassigned (Adv. Mater. 2012, 24, 5487), now providing a holistic picture on varying spacer length. In fact, external stimuli of the film by modulating the geometry of the CT complex, which results in on/off fluorescence switching (for n &gt; 4) or in a change of the emission color (n = 4). The work thus demonstrates how in&#8208;depth analysis of complex photophysics can be put to practical use in materials science.

         <title>Reversed Electron Transfer in Dual Single Atom Catalyst for Boosted Photoreduction of CO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the synthesis of Au/Co dual single atom (DSA) loaded CdS for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. A reversed electron transfer mechanism is confirmed for this Au/Co DSA that leads to localized electrons around Co, and delocalized electrons from Au. This boosts electron transfer and CO2 adsorption/activation/reduction leading to a highly significant increase in reduction.








Abstract
Photogenerated charge localization on material surfaces significantly affects photocatalytic performance, especially for multi&#8208;electron CO2 reduction. Dual single atom (DSA) catalysts with flexibly designed reactive sites have received significant research attention for CO2 photoreduction. However, the charge transfer mechanism in DSA catalysts remains poorly understood. Here, for the first time, a reversed electron transfer mechanism on Au and Co DSA catalysts is reported. In situ characterizations confirm that for CdS nanoparticles (NPs) loaded with Co or Au single atoms, photogenerated electrons are localized around the single atom of Co or Au. In DSA catalysts, however, electrons are delocalized from Au and accumulate around Co atoms. Importantly, combined advanced spectroscopic findings and theoretical computation evidence that this reversed electron transfer in Au/Co DSA boosts charge redistribution and activation of CO2 molecules, leading to highly significantly increased photocatalytic CO2 reduction, for example, Au/Co DSA loaded CdS exhibits, respectively, &#8776;2800% and 700% greater yields for CO and CH4 compared with that for CdS alone. Reversed electron transfer in DSA can be used for practical design for charge redistribution and to boost photoreduction of CO2.

     alt="Reversed Electron Transfer in Dual Single Atom Catalyst for Boosted Photoreduction of CO2"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work reports the synthesis of Au/Co dual single atom (DSA) loaded CdS for photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction. A reversed electron transfer mechanism is confirmed for this Au/Co DSA that leads to localized electrons around Co, and delocalized electrons from Au. This boosts electron transfer and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption/activation/reduction leading to a highly significant increase in reduction.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photogenerated charge localization on material surfaces significantly affects photocatalytic performance, especially for multi-electron CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction. Dual single atom (DSA) catalysts with flexibly designed reactive sites have received significant research attention for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photoreduction. However, the charge transfer mechanism in DSA catalysts remains poorly understood. Here, for the first time, a reversed electron transfer mechanism on Au and Co DSA catalysts is reported. In situ characterizations confirm that for CdS nanoparticles (NPs) loaded with Co or Au single atoms, photogenerated electrons are localized around the single atom of Co or Au. In DSA catalysts, however, electrons are delocalized from Au and accumulate around Co atoms. Importantly, combined advanced spectroscopic findings and theoretical computation evidence that this reversed electron transfer in Au/Co DSA boosts charge redistribution and activation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules, leading to highly significantly increased photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction, for example, Au/Co DSA loaded CdS exhibits, respectively, &#8776;2800% and 700% greater yields for CO and CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; compared with that for CdS alone. Reversed electron transfer in DSA can be used for practical design for charge redistribution and to boost photoreduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Findings will be of benefit to researchers and manufacturers in DSA-loaded catalysts for the generation of solar fuels.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unleashing the Full Potential of Photo&#8208;Driven CO&#160;Hydrogenation to Light Olefins over Carbon&#8208;Coated CoMn&#8208;Based Catalysts</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel carbon&#8208;coated CoMn&#8208;based catalyst, a C&#8208;coated mixture of Co and MnO, is designed to efficiently utilize full&#8208;spectral solar light for converting syngas to light olefins. Through the coupling of photo&#8208;thermocatalysis and photocatalysis (between MnO and Co with carbon mediation), the catalyst unleashes the full potential of a photodriven reaction, achieving 5.5&#8208;fold the activity of thermal catalysis.








Abstract
As a nonpetroleum process, photodriven Fischer&#8211;Tropsch synthesis provides a practical approach for the synthesis of light olefins. However, maximizing the solar&#8208;energy conversion efficiency based on the design of the composite catalyst and understanding the catalytic mechanism remain challenging. Herein, a novel carbon&#8208;coated CoMn&#8208;based catalyst, a C&#8208;coated mixture of Co and MnO, is designed for the efficient conversion of syngas to light olefins under light irradiation. The CoMnC&#8208;450 catalyst exhibits a CO conversion of 12.6% with a selectivity to light olefins of 36.5% under light irradiation, showing 5.5&#8208;fold the activity of thermocatalysis. Experimental characterizations as certain the CoMnC&#8208;450 catalyst can be excited to generate photogenerated carriers under light irradiation and then the electron transfer to metallic Co to form electron&#8208;rich active sites with carbon mediation, thereby enhancing the catalytic performance. In situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and theoretical calculation based on density functional theory reveal the unique roles of photogenerated carriers in promoting the adsorption and activation of CO molecules. This study demonstrates a feasible catalyst model to efficiently utilize full&#8208;spectral solar light to produce the value&#8208;added chemical.

         <title>Mimicking Antioxidases and Hyaluronan Synthase: A Zwitterionic Nanozyme for Photothermal Therapy of Osteoarthritis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photothermal dual&#8208;bionic nanozyme (MPMP), mimicking antioxidases and hyaluronan synthase, is developed for effective osteoarthritis (OA) therapy, which can produce heat, scavenge free radical and promote chondrogenesis even if under inflammatory conditions. This nanozyme regulates anabolic and catabolic processes simultaneously, thereby restoring joint homeostasis effectively and demonstrating an admirable photothermally therapeutic&#160; effect on OA.








Abstract
Restoring joint homeostasis is crucial for relieving osteoarthritis (OA). Current strategies are limited to unilateral efforts in joint lubrication, inhibition of inflammation, free radicals scavenging, and cartilage regeneration. Herein, by modifying molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) with Mg2+&#8208;doped polydopamine and coating with polysulfobetaines, a dual&#8208;bionic photothermal nanozyme (MPMP) is constructed to mimic antioxidases/hyaluronan synthase for OA therapy. Photothermally enhanced lubrication lowers the coefficient of friction (0.028) in the early stage of OA treatment. The antioxidases&#8208;mimicking properties of MPMP nanozyme contribute to eliminating reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) (over 90% of scavenging ratio for H2O2/&#183;OH/O&#183;2&#8211;/DPPH/ABTS+) and supplying O2. With NIR irradiation, the MPMP nanozyme triggers thermogenesis (upregulating HSP70 expression) and Mg2+ release, which promotes the chondrogenesis in inflammatory conditions by deactivating NF&#8208;&#954;B/IL&#8208;17 signaling pathways and enhancing MAPK signaling pathway. Benefiting from HSP70 and Mg2+, MPMP&#8208;NIR shows HAS&#8208;mimicking activity to increase the intracellular (twofold) and extracellular (3.12&#8208;fold) HA production. Therefore, MPMP&#8208;NIR demonstrates superior spatiotemporally therapeutic effect on OA in mice model, in terms of osteophytes (83.41% of reduction), OARSI scores (88.57% of reduction), and ACAN expression (2.70&#8208;fold of increment). Hence, insights into dual&#8208;bionic nanozymes can be a promising strategy for OA therapy or other inflammation&#8208;related diseases.

&#8220;Fish&#8208;in&#8208;net&#8221; encapsulation of sulfur nanoparticles in an ordered metal&#8211;organic framework is reported as an efficient strategy for overcoming the sluggish kinetics and parasitic shuttling in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. This approach results in long&#8208;term stability, ion screening, high lithium&#8208;polysulfide adsorption, and decent multistep catalytic conversion, thereby significantly improving the interfacial charge&#8208;transfer kinetics and sulfur conversion rate.








Abstract
Sluggish kinetics and parasitic shuttling reactions severely impede lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) battery operation; resolving these issues can enhance the capacity retention and cyclability of Li&#8211;S cells. Therefore, an effective strategy featuring core&#8211;shell&#8208;structured Co/Ni bimetal&#8208;doped metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)/sulfur nanoparticles is reported herein for addressing these problems; this approach offers unprecedented spatial confinement and abundant catalytic sites by encapsulating sulfur within an ordered architecture. The protective shells exhibit long&#8208;term stability, ion screening, high lithium&#8208;polysulfide adsorption capability, and decent multistep catalytic conversion. Additionally, the delocalized electrons of the MOF endow the cathodes with superior electron/lithium&#8208;ion transfer ability. Via multiple physicochemical and theoretical analysis, the resulting synergistic interactions are proved to significantly promote interfacial charge&#8208;transfer kinetics, facilitate sulfur conversion dynamics, and inhibit shuttling. The assembled Li&#8211;S batteries deliver a stable, highly reversible capacity with marginal decay (0.075% per cycle) for 400 cycles at 0.2 C, a pouch&#8208;cell areal capacity of 3.8 mAh cm&#8722;2 for 200 cycles under a high sulfur loading, as well as remarkably improved pouch&#8208;cell performance.

         <title>Grain Boundary Elimination via Recrystallization&#8208;Assisted Vapor Deposition for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vapor deposition method in combination with a solvent&#8208;assisted recrystallization technique is presented to fabricate high&#8208;quality larger&#8208;area perovskite film. Efficiency of 19.9% is achieved, which is among the highest values ever reported for minimodules based on vapor&#8208;deposited perovskite.








Abstract
Vapor deposition is a promising technology for the mass production of perovskite solar cells. However, the efficiencies of solar cells and modules based on vapor&#8208;deposited perovskites are significantly lower than those fabricated using the solution method. Emerging evidence suggests that large defects are generated during vapor deposition owing to a specific top&#8208;down crystallization mechanism. Herein, a hybrid vapor deposition method combined with solvent&#8208;assisted recrystallization for fabricating high&#8208;quality large&#8208;area perovskite films with low defect densities is presented. It is demonstrated that an intermediate phase can be formed at the grain boundaries, which induces the secondary growth of small grains into large ones. Consequently, perovskite films with substantially reduced grain boundaries and defect densities are fabricated. Results of temperature&#8208;dependent charge&#8208;carrier dynamics show that the proposed method successfully suppresses all recombination reactions. Champion efficiencies of 21.9% for small&#8208;area (0.16 cm2) cells and 19.9% for large&#8208;area (10.0 cm2) solar modules under AM 1.5 G irradiation are achieved. Moreover, the modules exhibit high operational stability, i.e., they retain &gt;92% of their initial efficiencies after 200&#160;h of continuous operation.

Herein, a hybrid vapor deposition method combined with solvent-assisted recrystallization for fabricating high-quality large-area perovskite films with low defect densities is presented. It is demonstrated that an intermediate phase can be formed at the grain boundaries, which induces the secondary growth of small grains into large ones. Consequently, perovskite films with substantially reduced grain boundaries and defect densities are fabricated. Results of temperature-dependent charge-carrier dynamics show that the proposed method successfully suppresses all recombination reactions. Champion efficiencies of 21.9% for small-area (0.16 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) cells and 19.9% for large-area (10.0 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) solar modules under AM 1.5 G irradiation are achieved. Moreover, the modules exhibit high operational stability, i.e., they retain &amp;gt;92% of their initial efficiencies after 200&#160;h of continuous operation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Identifying a Universal Activity Descriptor and a Unifying Mechanism Concept on Perovskite Oxides for Green Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal activity descriptor (orbital charge&#8208;transfer energy) is successfully extracted from various materials&#8217; physicochemical properties for both hydrogen&#8208;evolving and oxygen&#8208;evolving reactions in multiple electrolytes. Systematic experiments and computations reveal the life&#8208;cycle HER and OER mechanisms and identify the unifying orbital charge&#8208;transfer theory as a powerful mechanism analysis tool and foundation.








Abstract
Producing indispensable hydrogen and oxygen for social development via water electrolysis shows more prospects than other technologies. Although electrocatalysts have been explored for centuries, a universal activity descriptor for both hydrogen&#8208;evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen&#8208;evolution reaction (OER) is not yet developed. Moreover, a unifying concept is not yet established to simultaneously understand HER/OER mechanisms. Here, the relationships between HER/OER activities in three common electrolytes and over ten representative material properties on 12 3d&#8208;metal&#8208;based model oxides are rationally bridged through statistical methodologies. The orbital charge&#8208;transfer energy (&#916;) can serve as an ideal universal descriptor, where a neither too large nor too small &#916; (&#8776;1&#160;eV) with optimal electron&#8208;cloud density around Fermi level affords the best activities, fulfilling Sabatier's principle. Systematic experiments and computations unravel that pristine oxide with &#916; &#8776; 1&#160;eV possesses metal&#8208;like high&#8208;valence configurations and active lattice&#8208;oxygen sites to help adsorb key protons in HER and induce lattice&#8208;oxygen participation in the OER, respectively. After reactions, partially generated metals in the HER and high&#8208;valence hydroxides in the OER dominate proton adsorption and couple with pristine lattice&#8208;oxygen activation, respectively. These can be successfully rationalized by the unifying orbital charge&#8208;transfer theory. This work provides the foundation of rational material design and mechanism understanding for many potential applications.

         <title>A General Strategy for Developing Ultrasensitive &#8220;Transistor&#8208;Like&#8221; Thermochromic Fluorescent Materials for Multilevel Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular&#8208;engineering strategy based on rational design and selection of fluorophores and phase&#8208;change molecules to construct color&#8208;independent thermochromic fluorescent materials (TFMs) with ultrasensitive thermoresponsive fluorescence switching, high brightness, and superior reversibility and stability to the heating&#8211;cooling cycle is reported. By using these TFMs, a thermo&#8208;controllable multilevel information encryption/decryption is achieved within 10&#160;K temperature change.








Abstract
Thermochromic fluorescent materials (TFMs) exhibit great potential in information encryption applications but are limited by low thermosensitivity, poor color tunability, and a wide temperature&#8208;responsive range. Herein, a novel strategy for constructing highly sensitive TFMs with tunable emission (450&#8211;650&#160;nm) toward multilevel information encryption is proposed, which employs polarity&#8208;sensitive fluorophores with donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor (D&#8211;A&#8211;D) type structures as emitters and long&#8208;chain alkanes as thermosensitive loading matrixes. The structure&#8211;function relationships between the performance of TFMs and the structures of both fluorescent emitters and phase&#8208;change molecules are systematically studied. Benefiting from the above design, the obtained TFMs exhibit over 9500&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement toward the temperature change, as well as ultrahigh relative temperature sensitivity up to 80%&#160;K&#8722;1, which are first confirmed. Thanks to the superior transducing performance, the above&#8208;prepared TFMs can be further developed as information&#8208;storage platforms within a relatively narrow interval of temperature variation, including temperature&#8208;dominated multicolored information display and multilevel information encryption. This work will not only provide a novel perspective for designing superior TFMs for information encryption but also bring inspiration to the design and preparation of other response&#8208;switching&#8208;type fluorescent probes with ultrahigh conversion efficiency.

         <title>Beyond Rattling: Tetrahedrites as Incipient Ionic Conductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In tetrahedrite, copper ions are mobile at temperatures of 200&#160;K or above, but confined to cages within the crystal structure. The localized diffusional jumps of the copper ions within a confined octahedral environment are effective at suppressing thermal conduction. This work reveals that tetrahedrite behaves as an incipient ionic conductor.








Abstract
Materials with ultralow thermal conductivity are crucial to many technological applications, including thermoelectric energy harvesting, thermal barrier coatings, and optoelectronics. Liquid&#8208;like mobile ions are effective at disrupting phonon propagation, hence suppressing thermal conduction. However, high ionic mobility leads to the degradation of liquid&#8208;like thermoelectric materials under operating conditions due to ion migration and metal deposition at the cathode, hindering their practical application. Here, a new type of behavior, incipient ionic conduction, which leads to ultralow thermal conductivity, while overcoming the issues of degradation inherent in liquid&#8208;like materials, is identified. Using neutron spectroscopy and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, it is demonstrated that in tetrahedrite, an established thermoelectric material with a remarkably low thermal conductivity, copper ions,&#160;although mobile above 200 K, are predominantly confined to cages within the crystal structure. Hence the undesirable migration of cations to the cathode can be avoided. These findings unveil a new approach for the design of materials with ultralow thermal conductivity, by exploring systems in which incipient ionic conduction may be present.

Thermochromic Fluorescent Materials
In article number 2305472, Xiaobo Zhou, Yuling Qin, Li Wu, and co&#8208;workers present a comprehensive approach for the development of highly sensitive thermochromic fluorescent materials (TFMs) suitable for multilevel information encryption. They employ polarity&#8208;sensitive fluorophores with D&#8211;A&#8211;D type structures as emitters and long&#8208;chain alkanes as thermosensitive loading matrices. Thanks to this well&#8208;designed strategy, the resulting TFMs exhibit remarkable fluorescence enhancements within relatively narrow range of temperature variations.

Circularly Polarized Luminescence
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) is the emission of left&#8208; or right&#8208;handed helical light, and a key property of certain chiral materials with applications such as highly efficient displays, holography, sensing, enantiospecific discrimination, synthesis of drugs, quantum computing, and cryptography. In article number 2302279 by Sascha Feldmann and co&#8208;workers, the fundamentals, advances, pitfalls and software for accurately measuring CPL are described.

Extracellular Vesicles
Extracellular vesicles have emerged as therapeutic agents, biomarkers, and potential drug carriers. However, current techniques for their isolation are relatively inefficient. In article number 2212000, Jean&#8208;Christophe Leroux and co&#8208;workers report the development of a novel electrochemical device with affinity&#8208;based capturing for the rapid isolation of extracellular vesicles from biosamples and their further purification after loading with exogenous compounds.

Stretchable Electronics
In article number 2303458, Dae&#8208;Hyeong Kim and co&#8208;workers report how when a nanocomposite solution is solidified in high humidity, nanowires self&#8208;assemble into bundles, resulting in a highly conductive and stretchable nanocomposite. The nanocomposite is then cut into a serpentine&#8208;shaped wearable thermostimulation device and applied to the wrist.

In this review,&#160;we&#160;focus on the optical properties of CDs based on their structural design and recent trends in electroluminescent LED applications.








Abstract
Carbon dots (CDs), as emerging carbon nanomaterials, have been regarded as promising alternatives for electroluminescent light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) owing to their distinct characteristics, such as low toxicity, tuneable photoluminescence, and good photostability. In the last few years, despite remarkable progress achieved in CD&#8208;based LEDs, their device performance is still inferior to that of well&#8208;developed organic, heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;based QDs, and perovskite LEDs. To better exploit LED applications and boost device performance, in this review, a comprehensive overview of currently explored CDs is presented, focusing on their key optical characteristics, which are closely related to the structural design of CDs from their carbon core to surface modifications, and to macroscopic structural engineering, including the embedding of CDs in the matrix or spatial arrangement of CDs. The design of CD&#8208;based LEDs for display and lighting applications based on the fluorescence, phosphorescence, and delayed fluorescence emission of CDs is also highlighted. Finally, it is concluded with a discussion regarding the key challenges and plausible prospects in this field. It is hoped that this review inspires more extensive research on CDs from a new perspective and promotes practical applications of CD&#8208;based LEDs in multiple directions of current and future research.

         <title>Perovskite&#8208;Solar&#8208;Cell&#8208;Powered Integrated Fuel Conversion and Energy&#8208;Storage Devices</title>

A comprehensive overview of the emerging perovskite&#8208;solar&#8208;cell&#8208;based photo&#8208;electrochemical device, including the configuration design, key parameters, working principle, integration strategies, electrode materials, and their performance evaluations, is highlighted. The existing challenges and future perspectives are provided for the ongoing research in this promising field.








Abstract
Metal halide hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have received considerable attention over the past decade owing to their potential for low&#8208;cost, solution&#8208;processable, earth&#8208;abundant, and high&#8208;performance superiority, increasing power conversion efficiencies of up to 25.7%. Solar energy conversion into electricity is highly efficient and sustainable, but direct utilization, storage, and poor energy diversity are difficult to achieve, resulting in a potential waste of resources. Considering its convenience and feasibility, converting solar energy into chemical fuels is regarded as a promising pathway for boosting energy diversity and expanding its utilization. In addition, the energy conversion&#8211;storage integrated system can efficiently sequentially capture, convert, and store energy in electrochemical energy storage devices. However, a comprehensive overview focusing on PSC&#8208;self&#8208;driven integrated devices with a discussion of their development and limitations remains lacking. Here, focus is on the development of representative configurations of emerging PSC&#8208;based photo&#8208;electrochemical devices including self&#8208;charging power packs, unassisted solar water splitting/CO2 reduction. The advanced progresses in this field, including configuration design, key parameters, working principles, integration strategies, electrode materials, and their performance evaluations are also summarized. Finally, scientific challenges and future perspectives for ongoing research in this field are presented.

         <dc:description>
Ternary copper halides (TCHs) have generated considerable attention for the exceptional structure diversity and fascinating optoelectronic properties. The recent advances of currently explored TCHs are systemically summarized, regarding the crystal and electronic structure, synthesis strategy, photophysical mechanism, luminescence regulation, environmental stability, and their emerging applications. Moreover, current existing challenges and possible development directions are proposed for their further development.








Abstract
Recently, the newly&#8208;emerging lead&#8208;free metal&#8208;halide materials with less toxicity and superior optoelectronic properties have received wide attention as the safer and potentially more robust alternatives to lead&#8208;based perovskite counterparts. Among them, ternary copper halides (TCHs) have become a vital group due to their unique features, including abundant structural diversity, ease of synthesis, unprecedented optoelectronic properties, high abundance, and low cost. Although the recent efforts in this field have made certain progresses, some scientific and technological issues still remain unresolved. Herein, a comprehensive and up&#8208;to&#8208;date overview of recent progress on the fundamental characteristics of TCH materials and their versatile applications is presented, which contains topics such as: i) crystal and electronic structure features and synthesis strategies; ii) mechanisms of self&#8208;trapped excitons, luminescence regulation, and environmental stability; and iii) their burgeoning optoelectronic devices of phosphor&#8208;converted white light&#8208;emitting diodes (WLEDs), electroluminescent LEDs, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, X&#8208;ray scintillators, photodetectors, sensors, and memristors. Finally, the current challenges together with future perspectives on the development of TCH materials and applications are also critically described, which is considered to be critical for accelerating the commercialization of these rapidly evolving technologies.
