         <title>Elastic Plasmonic&#8208;Enhanced Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot Cavities with Ultrasensitive Stretching Tunability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel plasmon&#8208;enhanced stretchable Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot (FP) cavities obtained by a catalytic self&#8208;embedding process of Au&#8208;nanodomes into elastomeric materials are demonstrated. The resulting FP resonances are amplified by the broad plasmonic resonances of the Au nanostructures and modulated by the scattering from the wrinkled surface. The optical response is highly mechanically tunable in both FP resonances intensity and spectral position.








Abstract
The emerging stretchable photonics field faces challenges, like the robust integration of optical elements into elastic matrices or the generation of large optomechanical effects. Here, the first stretchable plasmonic&#8208;enhanced and wrinkled Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot (FP) cavities are demonstrated, which are composed of self&#8208;embedded arrays of Au nanostructures at controlled depths into elastomer films. The novel self&#8208;embedding process is triggered by the Au nanostructures&#8217; catalytic activity, which locally increases the polymer curing rate, thereby inducing a mechanical stress that simultaneously pulls the Au nanostructures into the polymer and forms a wrinkled skin layer. This geometry yields unprecedented optomechanical effects produced by the coupling of the broad plasmonic modes of the Au nanostructures and the FP modes, which are modulated by the wrinkled optical cavity. As a result, film stretching induces drastic changes in both the spectral position and intensity of the plasmonic&#8208;enhanced FP resonances due to the simultaneous cavity thickness reduction and cavity wrinkle flattening, thus increasing the cavity finesse. These optomechanical effects are exploited to demonstrate new strain&#8208;sensing approaches, achieving a strain detection limit of 0.006%, i.e., 16&#8208;fold lower than current optical strain&#8208;detection schemes.

         <title>An Asymmetry Field&#8208;Effect Phototransistor for Solving Large Exciton Binding Energy of 2D TMDCs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric split&#8208;gate phototransistor configuration, called the &#8220;asymmetry field&#8208;effect phototransistor&#8221; (AFEPT) is demonstrated. The structure allows for an effective modulation of the electric&#8208;field profile throughout the channel, as well as enhanced photocarrier transport, thereby providing a new platform for improving optoelectronic properties and probing photocarrier dynamics in intrinsic 2D material layers.








Abstract
The probing of fundamental photophysics is a key prerequisite for the construction of diverse optoelectronic devices and circuits. To date, though, photocarrier dynamics in 2D materials remains unclear, plagued primarily by two issues: a large exciton binding energy, and the lack of a suitable system that enables the manipulation of excitons. Here, a WSe2&#8208;based phototransistor with an asymmetric split&#8208;gate configuration is demonstrated, which is named the &#8220;asymmetry field&#8208;effect phototransistor&#8221; (AFEPT). This structure allows for the effective modulation of the electric&#8208;field profile across the channel, thereby providing a standard device platform for exploring the photocarrier dynamics of the intrinsic WSe2 layer. By controlling the electric field, this work the spatial evolution of the photocurrent is observed, notably with a strong signal over the entire WSe2 channel. Using photocurrent and optical spectroscopy measurements, the physical origin of the novel photocurrent behavior is clarified and a room&#8208;temperature exciton binding energy of 210 meV is determined with the device. In the phototransistor geometry, lateral p&#8211;n junctions serve as a simultaneous pathway for both photogenerated electrons and holes, reducing their recombination rate and thus enhancing photodetection. The study establishes a new device platform for both fundamental studies and technological applications.

         <title>Tailoring Layer Number of 2D Porphyrin&#8208;Based MOFs Towards Photocoupled Electroreduction of CO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Freestanding monolayer and bilayer 2D porphyrin&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks can be easily synthesized via bottom&#8208;up growth. Interestingly, a difference in the atomic layer number results in a distinct catalytic pathway of photocoupled electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. The monolayer exhibits a high selectivity of C2 species, while the major products over the bilayer are C1 species. The photocoupled electrocatalytic mechanisms are further studied.








Abstract
Inspired by the success of graphene, a series of single&#8208; or few&#8208;layer 2D materials have been developed and applied in the past decade. Here, the successful preparation of monolayer and bilayer 2D porphyrin&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) by a facile solvothermal method is reported. The structure transition from monolayer to bilayer drives distinct electronic properties and restructuring behaviors, which finally results in distinct catalytic pathways towards CO2 electrocatalysis. The monolayer favors CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2 pathway due to the restructuring of Cu&#63743;O4 sites, while CO and HCOO&#8722; are the major products over the bilayer. In photocoupled electrocatalysis, the Faradaic efficiency (FE) of the C2 compounds shows a nearly fourfold increase on the monolayer than that under dark conditions (FEC2 increases from 11.9% to 41.1% at &#8722;1.4&#160;V). For comparison, the light field plays a negligible effect on the bilayer. The light&#8208;induced selectivity optimization is investigated by experimental characterization and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work opens up a novel possibility to tune the selectivity of carbon products just by tailoring the layer number of the 2D material.

         <title>Mixed Dimethylammonium/Methylammonium Lead Halide Perovskite Crystals for Improved Structural Stability and Enhanced Photodetection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A newly developed technique termed solvent acidolysis crystallization (SAC) allows the growth of mixed dimethylammonium/methylammonium lead tribromide crystals with the highest, as of yet, dimethylammonium incorporation of 44% while maintaining the perovskite cubic phase. This mixed cation composition not only suppresses the tetragonal to orthorhombic phase transition but also leads to improved photodetection capabilities both at room temperature and 200 K.








Abstract
The solvent acidolysis crystallization technique is utilized to grow mixed dimethylammonium/methylammonium lead tribromide (DMA/MAPbBr3) crystals reaching the highest dimethylammonium incorporation of 44% while maintaining the 3D cubic perovskite phase. These mixed perovskite crystals show suppression of the orthorhombic phase and a lower tetragonal&#8208;to&#8208;cubic phase&#8208;transition temperature compared to MAPbBr3. A distinct behavior is observed in the temperature&#8208;dependent photoluminescence properties of MAPbBr3 and mixed DMA/MAPbBr3 crystals due to the different organic cation dynamics governing the phase transition(s). Furthermore, lateral photodetectors based on these crystals show that, at room temperature, the mixed crystals possess higher detectivity compared to MAPbBr3 crystals caused by structural compression and reduced surface trap density. Remarkably, the mixed&#8208;crystal devices exhibit large enhancement in their detectivity below the phase&#8208;transition temperature (at 200 K), while for the MAPbBr3 devices only insignificant changes are observed. The high detectivity of the mixed crystals makes them attractive for visible&#8208;light communication and for space applications. The results highlight the importance of the synthetic technique for compositional engineering of halide perovskites that governs their structural and optoelectronic properties.

         <title>High&#8208;Current&#8208;Density Organic Electrochemical Diodes Enabled by Asymmetric Active Layer Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric design of the organic mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductor layer allows for the rectification of input signals with a high current density of over 30 kA cm&#8722;2 in an aqueous electrolyte. The operation mechanism is elucidated with the help of numerical analysis and in operando electrochemical potential mapping methods, and analog/digital circuits are demonstrated as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept of these novel device architectures.








Abstract
Owing to their outstanding electrical/electrochemical performance, operational stability, mechanical flexibility, and decent biocompatibility, organic mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductors have shown great potential as implantable electrodes for neural recording/stimulation and as active channels for signal switching/amplifying transistors. Nonetheless, no studies exist on a general design rule for high&#8208;performance electrochemical diodes, which are essential for highly functional circuit architectures. In this work, generalizable electrochemical diodes with a very high current density over 30 kA cm&#8722;2 are designed by introducing an asymmetric active layer based on organic mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductors. The underlying mechanism on polarity&#8208;sensitive balanced ionic doping/dedoping is elucidated by numerical device analysis and in operando spectroelectrochemical potential mapping, while the general material requirements for electrochemical diode operation are deduced using various types of conjugated polymers. In parallel, analog signal rectification and digital logic processing circuits are successfully demonstrated to show the broad impact of circuits incorporating organic electrochemical diodes. It is expected that organic electrochemical diodes will play vital roles in realizing multifunctional soft bioelectronic circuitry in combination with organic electrochemical transistors.

         <title>Tackling Humidity with Designer Ionic Liquid&#8208;Based Gas Sensing Soft Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Humidity influence in sensing of volatile organic compounds is tuned by materials design. The anions of ionic liquids tailor the gas sensing material's sensitivity to humidity, yielding either humidity&#8208;sensitive or humidity&#8208;tolerant odorant sensors that do not require sample preconditioning or signal processing to correct humidity impact, thereby contributing to the widespread field of artificial olfaction.








Abstract
Relative humidity is simultaneously a sensing target and a contaminant in gas and volatile organic compound (VOC) sensing systems, where strategies to control humidity interference are required. An unmet challenge is the creation of gas&#8208;sensitive materials where the response to humidity is controlled by the material itself. Here, humidity effects are controlled through the design of gelatin formulations in ionic liquids without and with liquid crystals as electrical and optical sensors, respectively. In this design, the anions [DCA]&#8722; and [Cl]&#8722; of room temperature ionic liquids from the 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium family tailor the response to humidity and, subsequently, sensing of VOCs in dry and humid conditions. Due to the combined effect of the materials formulations and sensing mechanisms, changing the anion from [DCA]&#8722; to the much more hygroscopic [Cl]&#8722;, leads to stronger electrical responses and much weaker optical responses to humidity. Thus, either humidity sensors or humidity&#8208;tolerant VOC sensors that do not require sample preconditioning or signal processing to correct humidity impact are obtained. With the wide spread of 3D&#8208; and 4D&#8208;printing and intelligent devices, the monitoring and tuning of humidity in sustainable biobased materials offers excellent opportunities in e&#8208;nose sensing arrays and wearable devices compatible with operation at room conditions.

         <title>An NIR Discrete Metallacycle Constructed from Perylene Bisimide and Tetraphenylethylene Fluorophores for Imaging&#8208;Guided Cancer Radio&#8208;Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A theranostic metallacycle (M) is developed for imaging&#8208;guided cancer radio&#8208;chemotherapy using perylene bisimide fluorophore (PPy) and tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based di&#8208;Pt(II) organometallic precursor (TPE&#8208;Pt) as building blocks. Guided by in vivo fluorescence imaging, radio&#8208;chemotherapy is precisely carried out, which facilitates boosting the therapeutic outcomes and minimizing undesired side effects.








Abstract
To promote the clinical theranostic performances of platinum&#8208;based anticancer drugs, imaging capability is urgently desired, and their chemotherapeutic efficacy needs to be upgraded. Herein, a theranostic metallacycle (M) is developed for imaging&#8208;guided cancer radio&#8208;chemotherapy using perylene bisimide fluorophore (PPy) and tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based di&#8208;Pt(II) organometallic precursor (TPE&#8208;Pt) as building blocks. The formation of this discrete supramolecular coordination complex facilitates the encapsulation of M by a glutathione (GSH)&#8208;responsive amphiphilic block copolymer to prepare M&#8208;loaded nanoparticles (MNPs). TPE&#8208;Pt acts as a chemotherapeutic drug and also an excellent radiosensitizer, thus incorporating radiotherapy into the nanomedicine to accelerate the therapeutic efficacy and overcome drug resistance. The NIR&#8208;emission of PPy is employed to detect the intracellular delivery and tissue distribution of MNPs in real time. In vitro and in vivo investigations demonstrate the excellent anticancer efficacy combining chemotherapy and radiotherapy; the administration of this nanomedicine effectively inhibits the tumor growth and greatly extends the survival rate of cisplatin&#8208;resistant A2780CIS&#8208;tumor&#8208;bearing mice. Guided by in vivo fluorescence imaging, radio&#8208;chemotherapy is precisely carried out, which facilitates boosting of the therapeutic outcomes and minimizing undesired side effects. The success of this theranostic system brings new hope to supramolecular nanomedicines for their potential clinical translations.

         <title>Guiding Transition Metal&#8208;Doped Hollow Cerium Tandem Nanozymes with Elaborately Regulated Multi&#8208;Enzymatic Activities for Intensive Chemodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hollow mesoporous Mn/Zr&#8208;co&#8208;doped CeO2 tandem nanozyme is developed, serving as an H2O2 homeostasis disruptor to promote H2O2 evolvement, restrain the off&#8208;target elimination of H2O2, and realize intensive nanozyme&#8208;initiated chemodynamic therapy of tumor. T1&#8208;weighted magnetic resonance imaging and high&#8208;contrast X&#8208;ray computed tomography imaging are also achieved using the nanozyme for in vivo tracking of the therapeutic process.








Abstract
Clinical applications of nanozyme&#8208;initiated chemodynamic therapy (NCDT) have been severely limited by the poor catalytic efficiency of nanozymes, insufficient endogenous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) content, and its off&#8208;target consumption. Herein, the authors&#160;developed a hollow mesoporous Mn/Zr&#8208;co&#8208;doped CeO2 tandem nanozyme (PHMZCO&#8208;AT) with regulated multi&#8208;enzymatic activities, that is, the enhancement of superoxide dismutase (SOD)&#8208;like and peroxidase (POD)&#8208;like activities and inhibition of catalase (CAT)&#8208;like activity. PHMZCO&#8208;AT as a H2O2 homeostasis disruptor promotes H2O2 evolution and restrains off&#8208;target elimination of H2O2 to achieve intensive NCDT. PHMZCO&#8208;AT with SOD&#8208;like activity catalyzes endogenous superoxide anion (O2&#8226;&#8722;) into H2O2 in the tumor region. The suppression of CAT activity and depletion of glutathione by PHMZCO&#8208;AT largely weaken the off&#8208;target decomposition of H2O2 to H2O. Elevated H2O2 is then catalyzed by the downstream POD&#8208;like activity of PHMZCO&#8208;AT to generate toxic hydroxyl radicals, further inducing tumor apoptosis and death. T1&#8208;weighted magnetic resonance imaging and X&#8208;ray computed tomography imaging are also achieved using PHMZCO&#8208;AT due to the existence of paramagnetic Mn2+ and the high X&#8208;ray attenuation ability of elemental Zr, permitting in vivo tracking of the therapeutic process. This work presents a typical paradigm to achieve intensive NCDT efficacy by regulating multi&#8208;enzymatic activities of nanozymes to perturb the H2O2 homeostasis.

         <title>POM Anolyte for All&#8208;Anion Redox Flow Batteries with High Capacity Retention and Coulombic Efficiency at Mild pH</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to the multi&#8208;electron redox ability, structure stability, and high redox kinetics of {BW12} polyoxometalate (POM) anion anolyte at mild pH, all&#8208;anion aqueous redox flow batteries coupled with different catholyte anion exhibit very high capacity retention. An in&#8208;operando aqueous flowing Raman spectroscopy technique is also first constructed to investigate the structural revolution and stability of POMs anion during battery operation.








Abstract
A highly soluble Li5BW12O40 cluster delivers 2 e&#8722; redox reaction with fast electron transfer rates (2.5 &#215; 10&#8722;2&#160;cm s&#8722;1) and high diffusion coefficients (&#8776;2.08 &#215; 10&#8722;6 cm2 s&#8722;1) at mild pH ranging from 3 to 8. In&#8208;operando aqueous&#8208;flowing Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations reveal that Raman shift changing of {BW12} clusters is due to the bond length changing between W&#8208;Ob&#8208;W and W&#8208;Oc&#8208;W at different redox states. The structure changing and redox chemistry of Li5BW12O40 are highly reversible, which makes the Li5BW12O40 cluster versatile to construct all&#8208;anion aqueous redox flow batteries (RFBs). The cation&#8208;exchange Nafion membrane will also repel the cross permeability of the anion redox couples. Consequently, by coupling with Li3K[Fe(CN)6] catholyte, the aqueous RFB can be operated at pH 8 with a capacity retention up to 95% and an average Coulombic efficiency more than 99.79% over 300 cycles within 0 to 1.2&#160;V. Meanwhile, Li5BW12O40 cluster can also be paired with LiI catholyte to form aqueous RFBs at pH 7 and pH 3, the capacity retention of 94% and 90% can be realized over 300 cycles within 0 to 1.3&#160;V.

         <title>Kinetics Manipulation Enables High&#8208;Performance Thick Ternary Organic Solar Cells via R2R&#8208;Compatible Slot&#8208;Die Coating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient, thick ternary organic solar cells are fabricated by roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll (R2R)&#8208;compatible slot&#8208;die coating via kinetics manipulation. A highly crystalline molecule, BTR&#8208;Cl, is incorporated, and the phase&#8208;separation kinetics of the D18:Y6 film is regulated. The molecular crystallinity and vertical phase separation of the ternary blends is improved, which results in high power conversion efficiencies of 17.2% and 15.5% for photoactive films with thicknesses of 110 and 300 nm, respectively.








Abstract
Power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs) has crossed the 18% mark for OSCs, which are largely fabricated by spin&#8208;coating, and the optimal photoactive thickness is limited to 100&#160;nm. To increase reproducibility of results with industrial roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll (R2R) processing, slot&#8208;die coating coupled with a ternary strategy for optimal performance of large&#8208;area, thick OSCs is used. Based on miscibility differences, a highly crystalline molecule, BTR&#8208;Cl, is incorporated, and the phase&#8208;separation kinetics of the D18:Y6 film is regulated. BTR&#8208;Cl provides an early liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation and early aggregation of Y6, which slightly improves the molecular crystallinity and vertical phase separation of the ternary blends, resulting in high PCEs of 17.2% and 15.5% for photoactive films with thicknesses of 110 and 300&#160;nm, respectively. The ternary design strategy for large&#8208;area and thick films is further used to fabricate high&#8208;efficiency flexible devices, which promises reproducibility of the lab results from slot&#8208;die coating to industrial R2R manufacturing.

         <title>Reliable and Remote Monitoring of Absolute Temperature during Liver Inflammation via Luminescence&#8208;Lifetime&#8208;Based Nanothermometry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lifetime&#8208;based infrared luminescent nanothermometers are shown to be minimally affected by the effects of biological tissues on the propagation of photons. Real&#8208;time and reliable thermal monitoring of the liver of a mouse subjected to lipopolysaccharide&#8208;induced inflammation is achieved through the use of bright Ag2S nanoparticles. Remarkable thermal sensitivity (3% &#176;C&#8211;1 around 37 &#176;C) and thermal resolution (smaller than 0.3 &#176;C) are obtained.








Abstract
Temperature of tissues and organs is one of the first parameters affected by physiological and pathological processes, such as metabolic activity, acute trauma, or infection&#8208;induced inflammation. Therefore, the onset and development of these processes can be detected by monitoring deviations from basal temperature. To accomplish this, minimally invasive, reliable, and accurate measurement of the absolute temperature of internal organs is required. Luminescence nanothermometry is the ideal technology for meeting these requirements. Although this technique has lately undergone remarkable developments, its reliability is being questioned due to spectral distortions caused by biological tissues. In this work, how the use of bright Ag2S nanoparticles featuring temperature&#8208;dependent fluorescence lifetime enables reliable and accurate measurement of the absolute temperature of the liver in mice subjected to lipopolysaccharide&#8208;induced inflammation is demonstrated. Beyond the remarkable thermal sensitivity (&#8776; 3% &#176;C&#8211;1 around 37 &#176;C) and thermal resolution obtained (smaller than 0.3 &#176;C), the results included in this work set a blueprint for the development of new diagnostic procedures based on the use of intracorporeal temperature as a physiological indicator.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microfluidic channel embedded solution shearing is developed, which enables time&#8208; and resource&#8208;efficient generation and screening of thin&#8208;films of varying experimental conditions. Gaussian Process Regression algorithm tuned by Bayesian optimization is utilized to predict the transistor performance, optimize the experimental conditions, and investigate the vertical phase separation during solvent evaporation.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;based thin&#8208;film processing is a widely utilized technique for the fabrication of various devices. In particular, the tunability of the ink composition and coating condition allows precise control of thin&#8208;film properties and device performance. Despite the advantage of having such tunability, the sheer number of possible combinations of experimental parameters render it infeasible to efficiently optimize device performance and analyze the correlation between experimental parameters and device performance. In this work, a microfluidic screening&#8208;embedded thin&#8208;film processing technique is developed, through which thin&#8208;films of varying ratios of small molecule semiconductor:polymer blend are simultaneously generated and screened in a time&#8208; and resource&#8208;efficient manner. Moreover, utilizing the thin&#8208;films of varying combinations of experimental parameters, machine learning models are trained to predict the transistor performance. Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) algorithms tuned by Bayesian optimization shows the best predictive accuracy amongst the trained models, which enables narrowing down of the combinations of experimental parameters and investigation of the degree of vertical phase separation under the predicted parameter space. The technique can serve as a guideline for elucidating the underlying complex parameter&#8208;property&#8208;performance correlations in solution&#8208;based thin&#8208;film processing, thereby accelerating the optimization of various thin&#8208;film devices in the future.

         <dc:description>
An RNA&#8211;amorphous calcium phosphate nanomachine that induces extrafibrillar and intrafibrillar mineralization of collagen fibrils and regenerates new bone in a dynamic and programmable manner is developed. This multifunctional nanomachinery is comparable to the function of osteoblasts. The RNA&#8211;biomineral nanomachines that simulate physiological processes brings new opportunities and challenges to bone tissue engineering.








Abstract
The visionary idea that RNA adopts nonbiological roles in today's nanomaterial world has been nothing short of phenomenal.

&lt;p&gt;An RNA&#8211;amorphous calcium phosphate nanomachine that induces extrafibrillar and intrafibrillar mineralization of collagen fibrils and regenerates new bone in a dynamic and programmable manner is developed. This multifunctional nanomachinery is comparable to the function of osteoblasts.

&lt;p&gt;The visionary idea that RNA adopts nonbiological roles in today's nanomaterial world has been nothing short of phenomenal. These RNA molecules have ample chemical functionality and self-assemble to form distinct nanostructures in response to external stimuli.

         <title>Revealing the Sulfur Redox Paths in a Li&#8211;S Battery by an In Situ Hyphenated Technique of Electrochemistry and Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactions of sulfur in a Li&#8211;S battery are very complicated and the evaluation of their mechanism is challenging. Many hidden information can be easily revealed by an in situ electrochemistry and mass spectrometry (EC&#8208;MS) and it shines a light for design novel catalyst and system for the Li&#8211;S battery.








Abstract
The lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) battery is one of the most promising next generation energy storage systems due to its high theoretical specific energy. However, the shuttle effect of soluble lithium polysulfides formed during cell operation is a crucial reason for the low cyclability suffered by current Li&#8211;S batteries. As a result, an in&#8208;depth mechanistic understanding of the sulfur cathode redox reactions is urgently required for further advancement of Li&#8211;S batteries. Herein, the direct observation of polysulfides in a Li&#8208;S battery is reported by an in situ hyphenated technique of electrochemistry and mass spectrometry. Several short&#8208;lived lithium polysulfide intermediates during sulfur redox have been identified. Furthermore, this method is applied to a mechanistic study of an electrocatalyst that has been observed to promote the polysulfides conversion in a Li&#8211;S cell. Through the abundance distributions of various polysulfides before and after adding the electrocatalyst, compelling experimental evidences of catalytic selectivity of cobalt phthalocyanine to those long&#8208;chain polysulfide intermediates are obtained. This work can provide guidance for the design of novel cathode to overcome the shuttle effect and facilitate the sulfur redox kinetics.

         <title>Emerging Long&#8208;Range Order from Freeform Disordered Metasurface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Recently, disordered metasurface has attracted considerable interests due to the potential applications in imaging, holography, and wavefront shaping. However, how to emerge long&#8208;range ordered phase distribution in disordered metasurfaces remains an outstanding problem. Here, a general framework is proposed to generate spatially homogenous in&#8208;plane phase distribution from disordered metasurface, by engineering disorder parameters together with topology optimization. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, an all&#8208;dielectric disordered supercell metasurface with relatively homogeneous in&#8208;plane phase fluctuation is designed by disorder parameter engineering, manifesting as polarization conversion&#8208;dependent random scattering or unidirectional transmission. Then, topology optimization approach is utilized to overcome the lattice coupling effect and to further improve the homogeneity of complex electric field fluctuation. In comparison with initial supercell metasurface, the phase fluctuation range and relative efficiency of topology&#8208;optimized freeform metasurface are significantly improved, leading to long&#8208;range ordered electric field distribution. Moreover, three experimental realizations are performed, all of which agree well with theoretical results. This methodology may inspire more exotic optical phenomena and find more promising applications in disordered metasurfaces and disordered&#160;optics.

         <title>Scalable Van der Waals Encapsulation by Inorganic Molecular Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, an effective van der Waals passivation method for 2D materials with inorganic molecular crystal Sb2O3 as the encapsulation layer is developed. The scalable encapsulation method, carried out through a complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor&#8208;compatible manufacturing process, opens unprecedented opportunities for 2D materials to be applied in optoelectronic devices toward chip&#8208;level development.








Abstract
Encapsulation is critical for devices to guarantee their stability and reliability. It becomes an even more essential requirement for devices based on 2D materials with atomic thinness and far inferior stability compared to their bulk counterparts. Here a general van der Waals (vdW) encapsulation method for 2D materials using Sb2O3 layer of inorganic molecular crystal fabricated via thermal evaporation deposition is reported. It is demonstrated that such a scalable encapsulation method not only maintains the intrinsic properties of typical air&#8208;susceptible 2D materials due to their vdW interactions but also remarkably improves their environmental stability. Specifically, the encapsulated black phosphorus (BP) exhibits greatly enhanced structural stability of over 80 days and more sustaining&#8208;electrical properties of 19 days, while the bare BP undergoes degradation within hours. Moreover, the encapsulation layer can be facilely removed by sublimation in vacuum without damaging the underlying materials. This scalable encapsulation method shows a promising pathway to effectively enhance the environmental stability of 2D materials, which may further boost their practical application in novel (opto)electronic devices.

         <title>Efficient Single&#8208;Emitter Plasmonic Patch Antenna Fabrication by Deterministic in Situ Optical Lithography using Spatially Modulated Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Single&#8208;emitter plasmonic patch antennas are room&#8208;temperature deterministic single photon sources, which exhibit highly accelerated and directed single photon emission. However, for efficient operation these structures require three&#8208;dimensional nanoscale deterministic control of emitter positioning within the device, which is a demanding task, esp. when emitter damage during fabrication is a major concern. To overcome this limitation, our deterministic room&#8208;temperature in situ optical lithography protocol uses spatially modulated light to position a plasmonic structure non&#8208;destructively on any selected single&#8208;emitter with three&#8208;dimensional nanoscale control. In this paper the emission statistics of such plasmonic antennas that embed a deterministically positioned single colloidal CdSe/CdS quantum dot that highlight acceleration and brightness of emission are analyzed. It is demonstrated that the presented antenna induces a 1000&#8208;fold effective increase in the absorption cross&#8208;section, and under high pumping, these antennas show nonlinearly enhanced emission.

         <title>Sulfuration of Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based Cathode Materials for Multi&#8208;Anionic Redox and Stabilized Coordination Environment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Lithium&#8208;rich transition metal oxides (LLOs) can deliver high specific capacity over 250 mAh&#183;g&#8722;1, stemming from additional contribution of oxygen redox. However, the formation of O(2&#8211;n)&#8208; (0&lt;n&lt;2) species and even oxygen gas during the deep oxidation stage lead to progressive structural transformation that cause the voltage decay / hysteresis, sluggish kinetics and poor thermo&#8208;stability, preventing the real&#8208;world application of LLOs. Therefore, the substantive key relies in enhancing the anionic redox stability in LLOs. Here, we have purposed a sulfuration procedure of LLOs (S&#8208;LLOs), in which sulfur anions incorporate into oxygen sites in the lattice structure and form polyanions on the surface. Proved by structural characterizations and DFT calculations, sulfur anions in the interior lattice can reversibly participate in the redox process and enhance the integral coordination stability by mitigating undesired oxygen redox. Moreover, S polyanions at surface form a protecting layer for interfacial stability. The electrochemical measurements indicate that S&#8208;LLO demonstrates a high discharge capacity of 307.8 mAh&#183;g&#8722;1, an outstanding capacity retention rate of 91.5% after 200 cycles, along with excellent voltage maintenance, rate capability and thermo&#8208;stability. The sulfuration process of LLOs with multi&#8208;anionic redox mechanism highlights a promising strategy to design novel high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathode materials with superior cycling performance.

However, the formation of O&lt;sup&gt;(2&#8211;n)-&lt;/sup&gt; (0&amp;lt;n&amp;lt;2) species and even oxygen gas during the deep oxidation stage lead to progressive structural transformation that cause the voltage decay / hysteresis, sluggish kinetics and poor thermo-stability, preventing the real-world application of LLOs. Therefore, the substantive key relies in enhancing the anionic redox stability in LLOs. Here, we have purposed a sulfuration procedure of LLOs (S-LLOs), in which sulfur anions incorporate into oxygen sites in the lattice structure and form polyanions on the surface. Proved by structural characterizations and DFT calculations, sulfur anions in the interior lattice can reversibly participate in the redox process and enhance the integral coordination stability by mitigating undesired oxygen redox. Moreover, S polyanions at surface form a protecting layer for interfacial stability. The electrochemical measurements indicate that S-LLO demonstrates a high discharge capacity of 307.8 mAh&#183;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, an outstanding capacity retention rate of 91.5% after 200 cycles, along with excellent voltage maintenance, rate capability and thermo-stability. The sulfuration process of LLOs with multi-anionic redox mechanism highlights a promising strategy to design novel high-energy-density cathode materials with superior cycling performance.&lt;/p&gt;

Abstract
The realization of efficient on&#8208;chip microlasers with scalable fabrication, ultralow threshold, and stable single&#8208;frequency operation is always desired for a wide range of miniaturized photonic systems. Herein, an effective way to fabricate nanostructures&#8208; whispering&#8208;gallery&#8208;mode (WGM) lasers by drop&#8208;casting CdSe/CdS@Cd1&#8722;xZnxS core/buffer&#8208;shell@graded&#8208;shell nanoplatelets (NPLs) dispersion onto silica microspheres is presented. Benefiting from the excellent gain properties from the interface engineered core/hybrid shell NPLs and high&#8208;quality factor WGM resonator inherent from excellent optical field confinement, the proposed room&#8208;temperature NPLs&#8208;WGM microlasers show a record&#8208;low lasing threshold of 3.26 &#956;J cm&#8211;2 under nanosecond laser pumping among all colloidal NPLs&#8208;based lasing demonstrations. The presence of sharp discrete transverse electric&#8208; and magnetic&#8208;mode spikes, the inversely proportional dependence of the free spectra range on the size of microsphere and the polarization anisotropy of laser output represent the first direct experimental evidence for NPLs&#8208;WGM lasing nature, which is verified theoretically by the computed electric&#8208;field distribution inside the microcavity. Remarkably, a stable single&#8208;mode lasing output with an ultra&#8208;low lasing threshold of 3.84 &#956;J cm&#8211;2 is achieved by the Vernier effect through evanescent field coupling. Our results highlight the significance of interface engineering on the optimization of gain properties of heterostructured nanomaterials and shed light on developing future miniaturized tunable coherent light sources.

         <title>Room&#8208;temperature Ferromagnetism in Perylene Diimide Organic Semiconductor</title>

Abstract
The development of pure organic magnets with high Curie temperatures remains a challenging task in material science. Introducing high&#8208;density free radicals to strongly interacting organic molecules may be an effective method to this end. In this study, we use a solvothermal approach with excess hydrazine hydrate to concurrently reduce and dissolve rigid&#8208;backbone perylene diimide (PDI) crystallites into the soluble dianion species with a remarkably high reduction potential. The as&#8208;prepared PDI powders comprising radical anion aggregates were fabricated by the subsequent self&#8208;assembly and spontaneous oxidation process. The results of magnetic measurements show that the PDI powders exhibited room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism and a Curie temperature higher than 400 K, with a vast saturation magnetization that reached &#8764;1.2 emu&#183;g&#8722;1. Elemental analysis along with diamagnetic signal of the ablated residue were used to rule out the possibility that the magnetism was due to metal contaminations. Our findings suggest that the long&#8208;range ferromagnetic ordering can survive at room&#8208;temperature in organic semiconductors, and offers a new optional way to create room&#8208;temperature magnetic semiconductors.

         <title>Novel Oligomer Enables Green Solvent Processed 17.5% Ternary Organic Solar Cells: Synergistic Energy Loss Reduction and Morphology Fine&#8208;tuning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The large non&#8208;radiative recombination is the main factor that limits state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art organic solar cells (OSCs). In this work, we synthetized two novel structurally similar oligomers (5BDTBDD and 5BDDBDT) with D&#8208;A&#8208;D&#8208;A&#8208;D and A&#8208;D&#8208;A&#8208;D&#8208;A configuration for high&#8208;performance ternary OSCs with low energy loss. As third components, these PM6 analogue oligomers effectively suppress the non&#8208;radiative recombination of the ternary OSCs. Although the HOMO energy levels of 5BDTBDD and 5BDDBDT are higher than that of PM6, the oligomers showed ultra&#8208;high EQEEL of 0.05% and improved VOC was achieved in ternary OSCs, indicating that suppressing non&#8208;radiative recombination overweighs the common belief of deeper HOMO requirement in third component selection. Moreover, the different compatibility of 5BDTBDD and 5BDDBDT with PM6 and BTP&#8208;BO4Cl fine&#8208;tunes the morphology of the active layer and forms synergistic effects. The ternary devices based on PM6:5BDTBDD:BTP&#8208;BO4Cl and PM6:5BDDBDT:BTP&#8208;BO4Cl achieve a significantly improved PCEs of 17.54% and 17.32%, representing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art OSCs processed by green solvent of o&#8208;xylene. The strategy using novel oligomer as third component also has very wide composition tolerance. This is the first work that demonstrates novel structurally compatible D&#8208;A type oligomers are effective third components, and provides new understanding of energy loss mechanisms towards high performance OSCs.

         <title>Neisseria Meningitidis Opca Protein/MnO2 Hybrid Nanoparticles for Overcoming Blood Brain Barrier to Treat Glioblastoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The major hurdle in glioblastoma therapy is the low efficacy of drugs crossing the blood brain barrier (BBB). Neisseria meningitidis is known to specifically enrich in the central nervous system through the guidance of an outer membrane invasion protein named Opca. Here, by loading a chemotherapeutic drug methotrexate (MTX) in the hollow manganese dioxide (MnO2) nanoparticles with surface modification of Opca protein of Neisseria meningitidis, a bionic nanotherapeutic system (MTX@MnO2&#8208;Opca) is demonstrated to effectively overcome the BBB. The presence of Opca protein enables the drug to cross the BBB and penetrate into tumor tissues. After accumulating in glioblastoma, the nanotherapeutic system catalyzes the decomposition of excess H2O2 in the tumor tissue and thereby generates O2, which alleviates tumor hypoxia and enhances the effect of chemotherapy in the treatment of glioblastoma. This bionic nanotherapeutic system may exhibit great potential in the treatment of glioblastoma.

         <title>Air&#8208;Stable High&#8208;Nickel Cathode with Reinforced Electrochemical Performance Enabled by Convertible Amorphous Li2CO3 Modification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
High&#8208;nickel (Ni&#8805;90%) cathodes with high specific capacity hold great potential for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, their practical application is restricted by the high interfacial reactivity under continuous air erosion and electrolyte assaults. Herein, a stable high&#8208;nickel cathode was rationally designed via in&#8208;situ induction of a dense amorphous Li2CO3 on the particle surface by a preemptive atmosphere control. Among the residual lithium compounds, Li2CO3 is the most thermodynamically stable one so that the dense Li2CO3 coating layer can serve as a physical protection layer to isolate the cathodes from contact with moist air. Furthermore, amorphous Li2CO3 can be transformed into a robust F&#8208;rich cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) during cycling, which reinforces the cathodes interfacial stability and improves electrochemical performance. The assembled coin cell with this modified cathode delivers a high discharge capacity of 232.4 mAh g&#8211;1 with a superior initial coulombic efficiency of 95.1%, and a considerable capacity retention of 90.4% after 100 cycles. Furthermore, no slurry gelation occurred during large&#8208;scale electrode fabrication process. This work opens a valuable perspective on the evolution of amorphous Li2CO3 in LIBs and provides guidance on protecting unstable high&#8208;capacity cathodes for energy storage devices.

Among the residual lithium compounds, Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is the most thermodynamically stable one so that the dense Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; coating layer can serve as a physical protection layer to isolate the cathodes from contact with moist air. Furthermore, amorphous Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; can be transformed into a robust F-rich cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) during cycling, which reinforces the cathodes interfacial stability and improves electrochemical performance. The assembled coin cell with this modified cathode delivers a high discharge capacity of 232.4 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt; with a superior initial coulombic efficiency of 95.1%, and a considerable capacity retention of 90.4% after 100 cycles. Furthermore, no slurry gelation occurred during large-scale electrode fabrication process. This work opens a valuable perspective on the evolution of amorphous Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in LIBs and provides guidance on protecting unstable high-capacity cathodes for energy storage devices.&lt;/p&gt;

The role of iodide as an additive in lithium&#8211;oxygen batteries is not well understood, especially in the charging process. The recent advances on LiI are reviewed and the synergistic effect with water is discussed. Alternative approaches for enabling the charging process are also provided.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;oxygen (Li&#8211;O2) batteries possess a high theoretical energy density, which means they could become a potential alternative to lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Nevertheless, the charging process of Li&#8211;O2 batteries requires much higher energy, due to the insulating nature of the discharge product. It has been revealed that the anion additive, lithium iodide (LiI), can tune the cell chemistry to form lithium hydroxide (LiOH) as the product and facilitate the kinetics during the charging process. Although numerous studies have been reported, the role of this additive is still under investigation. Herein, the recent advances focusing on the use of LiI in Li&#8211;O2 batteries are reviewed, its catalytic behavior on discharge and charge is discussed, and its synergistic effect with water is understood. The ambiguity existing among the studies are also revealed, and solutions to the current issues are introduced.

         <title>Fabrication of Circularly Polarized MR&#8208;TADF Emitters with Asymmetrical Peripheral&#8208;Lock Enhancing Helical B/N&#8208;Doped Nanographenes</title>

Circularly polarized thermally activated delayed fluorescence (CP&#8208;TADF) and multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) properties are integrated into a new advanced material, a CPMR&#8208;TADF material. OLEDs based on these CPMR&#8208;TADF emitters show excellent performance, attaining a three&#8208;in&#8208;one advantage: high efficiency, color purity, and circular polarized light simultaneously.








Abstract
Circularly polarized thermally activated delayed fluorescence (CP&#8208;TADF) and multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF), which exhibit novel circularly polarized luminescence and excellent color fidelity, respectively, have gained immense popularity. In this study, integrated CP&#8208;TADF and MR&#8208;TADF (CPMR&#8208;TADF) are prepared by strategic design and synthesis of asymmetrical peripherally locked enantiomers, which are separated and denoted as (P,P&#8243;,P&#8243;)&#8208;/(M,M&#8243;,M&#8243;)&#8208;BN4 and (P,P&#8243;,P&#8243;)&#8208;/(M,M&#8243;,M&#8243;)&#8208;BN5 and exhibit TADF and circularly polarized light (CPL) properties. As the entire molecular frame participates in the frontier molecular orbitals, the resulting helical chirality of (+)/(&#8722;)&#8208;BN4&#8208; and (+)/(&#8722;)&#8208;BN5&#8208;based solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) helps in achieving a narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 49/49 and 48/48&#160;nm and a high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 20.6%/19.0% and 22.0%/26.5%, respectively. Importantly, unambiguous circularly polarized electroluminescence signals with dissymmetry factors (gEL) of +3.7 &#215; 10&#8722;3/&#8722;3.1 &#215; 10&#8722;3 (BN4) and +1.9 &#215; 10&#8722;3/&#8722;1.6 &#215; 10&#8722;3 (BN5) are obtained. The results indicate successful exploitation of CPMR&#8208;TADF&#8208;emitter&#8208;based OLEDs to exhibit three characteristics: high efficiency, color purity, and circularly polarized light.

         <title>Encapsulation of Metallic Zn in a Hybrid MXene/Graphene Aerogel as a Stable Zn Anode for Foldable Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A composite anode of metallic zinc (Zn) in graphene&#8211;MXene aerogel is prepared for Zn&#8208;ion batteries. The Zn metal is completely encapsulated inside the host in a 3D microscale manner, which suppresses the side reactions and regulates the Zn deposition. Meanwhile, the aerogel, with excellent flexibility, achieves stable electrochemical performance for foldable Zn&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
A 3D host can effectively mitigate the dendritic growth of a zinc (Zn)&#8208;metal anode. However, the increased electrode/electrolyte reaction area using the 3D substrate accelerates the passivation and corrosion at the anode interface, ultimately degrading the electrochemical performance. Here, an oriented freezing process is used to create a flexible MXene/graphene scaffold. Based on the abundant zincophilic traits and micropores in the structure, Zn is densely encapsulated inside the host by the electrodeposition process. During cycling, the composite anode endows an in situ solid electrolyte interface with zinc fluoride at the electrode/electrolyte interface due to inherent fluorine terminations in MXene, efficiently inhibiting the dendritic growth. Furthermore, the design wherein bulk Zn is distributed in a 3D microscale manner suppresses hydrogen evolution reactions (3.8&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2) and passivation, through in/ex situ tests. As a result, in a symmetrical cell test, the electrode has a long&#8208;cycling life of over 1000 h at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. After continuous single folding followed by double folding, a quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state foldable cell with the composite anode and a LiMn2O4 cathode (60% depth of discharge) maintains high&#8208;capacity retention of over 91%. This research presents a revolutionary encapsulating idea for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries, as well as foldable investigation.

         <title>Intracellular Condensates of Oligopeptide for Targeting Lysosome and Addressing Multiple Drug Resistance of Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lysosome selective construction of biomolecular hydrogel with emerging biological functions provides a novel strategy for controlling cancer cell fates by inducing lysosomal&#8208;membrane permeabilization and addressing multidrug resistance in a tumor&#8208;bearing mouse model.








Abstract
Biomolecular condensates have been demonstrated as a ubiquitous phenomenon in biological systems and play a crucial role in controlling cellular functions. However, the spatiotemporal construction of artificial biomolecular condensates with functions remains challenging and has been less explored. Herein, a general approach is reported to construct biomolecular condensates (e.g., hydrogel) in the lysosome of living cells for cancer therapy and address multiple drug resistance induced by lysosome sequestration. Aromatic&#8208;motif&#8208;appended pH&#8208;responsive hexapeptide (LTP) derived from natural insulin can be uptaken by cancer cells mainly through caveolae&#8208;dependent endocytosis, ensuring the proton&#8208;triggered phase transformation (solution to hydrogel) of LTP inside the lysosome specifically. Lysosomal hydrogelation further leads to enlargement of the lysosome in cancer cells and increases the permeability of the lysosome, resulting in cancer cell death. Importantly, lysosomal assemblies can significantly improve the efficiency of current chemotherapy drugs toward multidrug resistance (MDR) cells in vitro and in xenograft tumor models. As an example of functional artificial condensates in lysosomes, this work provides a new strategy for controlling functional condensates formation precisely in the organelles of living cells and addressing MDR in cancer therapy.

Importantly, lysosomal assemblies can significantly improve the efficiency of current chemotherapy drugs toward multidrug resistance (MDR) cells in vitro and in xenograft tumor models. As an example of functional artificial condensates in lysosomes, this work provides a new strategy for controlling functional condensates formation precisely in the organelles of living cells and addressing MDR in cancer therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Silk Microneedle Patch Capable of On&#8208;Demand Multidrug Delivery to the Brain for Glioblastoma Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silk microneedle (SMN) patch allows the integration of multiple therapeutic drugs with controlled release profiles to stop bleeding, inhibit angiogenesis, and promote apoptosis of glioblastoma cells. Drug release kinetics are well&#8208;defined by tuning the crosslinking degree of silk and applying a trigger of transcranial near&#8208;infrared light. SMN effectively suppresses tumor volume and improves the survival rate of mice in vivo.








Abstract
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor. Surgery followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy remains the standard treatment strategy for GBM patients. However, challenges still exist when surgery is difficult or impossible to remove the tumor completely. Herein, the design, fabrication and application of a heterogenous silk fibroin microneedle (SMN) patch is reported for circumventing the blood&#8208;brain barrier and releasing multiple drugs directly to the tumor site for drug combination treatment. The biocompatible and biodegradable SMN patch can dissolve slowly over time, allowing the sustained release of multiple drugs at different doses. Furthermore, it can be triggered remotely to induce rapid drug delivery at a designated stage after implantation. In the GBM mouse models, two clinically relevant chemotherapeutic agents (thrombin and temozolomide) and targeted drug (bevacizumab) are loaded into the SMN patch with individually controlled release profiles. The drugs are spatiotemporally and sequentially delivered for hemostasis, anti&#8208;angiogenesis, and apoptosis of tumor cells. Device application is non&#8208;toxic and results in decreased tumor volume and increased survival rate in mice. The SMN patch with on&#8208;demand multidrug delivery has potential applications for the combined administration of therapeutic drugs for the clinical treatment of brain tumors when other methods are insufficient.

         <title>Loading Single&#8208;Ni Atoms on Assembled Hollow N&#8208;Rich Carbon Plates for Efficient CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Assembled hollow N&#8208;rich carbon plates with single&#8208;Ni atoms (Ni&#8208;NC(AHP)) are constructed using a novel dual&#8208;linker zeolitic tetrazolate framework (ZTF) as precursor. The open structure and high external surface area enable the Ni&#8208;NC(AHP) catalyst with fast mass transfer and highly exposed single&#8208;Ni sites towards efficient CO2 electroreduction.








Abstract
The rational design of catalysts&#8217; spatial structure is vitally important to boost catalytic performance through exposing the active sites, enhancing the mass transfer, and confining the reactants. Herein, a dual&#8208;linker zeolitic tetrazolate framework&#8208;engaged strategy is developed to construct assembled hollow plates (AHP) of N&#8208;rich carbon (NC), which is loaded with single&#8208;Ni atoms to form a highly efficient electrocatalyst (designated as Ni&#8208;NC(AHP)). In the carbonization process, the thermally unstable linker (5&#8208;aminotetrazole) serves as the self&#8208;sacrificial template and the other linker (2&#8208;methylimidazole) mainly serves as the carbon and nitrogen source to form hollow NC matrix. The formed Ni&#8208;NC(AHP) catalyst possesses enhanced mesoporosity and more available surface area, thus promoting mass transport and affording abundant accessible single&#8208;Ni sites. These features contribute to remarkable performance for electrochemical CO2 reduction with exceptionally high selectivity of nearly 100% towards CO in a wide potential range and dramatically enhanced CO partial current density.

         <title>Controllable SiOx Nanorod Memristive Neuron for Probabilistic Bayesian Inference</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A probabilistic SiOx nanorod memristive neuron is fabricated by employing the glancing angle deposition technique. Due to the SiOx nanorod structure, a multitude of Si switching filaments at many SiOx nanorod edges can be formed, leading to different probabilistic activation functions with controllability. Furthermore, the self&#8208;resting neural operation and probabilistic Bayesian inferences are also demonstrated with the fabricated device.








Abstract
Modern artificial neural network technology using a deterministic computing framework is faced with a critical challenge in dealing with massive data that are largely unstructured and ambiguous. This challenge demands the advances of an elementary physical device for tackling these uncertainties. Here, we&#160;designed and fabricated a SiOx nanorod memristive device by employing the glancing angle deposition (GLAD) technique, suggesting a controllable stochastic artificial neuron that can mimic the fundamental integrate&#8208;and&#8208;fire signaling and stochastic dynamics of a biological neuron. The nanorod structure provides the random distribution of multiple nanopores all across the active area, capable of forming a multitude of Si filaments at many SiOx nanorod edges after the electromigration process, leading to a stochastic switching event with very high dynamic range (&#8776;5.15 &#215; 1010) and low energy (&#8776;4.06 pJ). Different probabilistic activation (ProbAct) functions in a sigmoid form are implemented, showing its controllability with low variation by manufacturing and electrical programming schemes. Furthermore, as an application prospect, based on the suggested memristive neuron, we&#160;demonstrated the self&#8208;resting neural operation with the local circuit configuration and revealed probabilistic Bayesian inferences for genetic regulatory networks with low normalized mean squared errors (&#8776;2.41 &#215; 10&#8208;2) and its robustness to the ProbAct variation.

         <title>Mesenchymal Stem Cell&#8208;Derived Extracellular Vesicles with High PD&#8208;L1 Expression for Autoimmune Diseases Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;expressing programmed cell death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are prepared for autoimmune diseases treatment. As cell&#8208;free carrier, MSC&#8208;sEVs&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 restore tissue lesion by reshaping the local immune microenvironment via programmed cell death&#8208;1 (PD&#8208;1)/PD&#8208;L1 pathway, which may potentially provide a universal platform technique for the immunotherapy of various autoimmune diseases.








Abstract
Autoimmune diseases are the third most common disease influencing the quality of life of many patients. Here, a programmed cell death&#8208;ligand 1 + (PD&#8208;L1) mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) derived extracellular vesicles (MSC&#8208;sEVs&#8208;PD&#8208;L1) using lentivirus&#8208;mediated gene transfection technology is developed for reconfiguration of the local immune microenvironment of affected tissue in autoimmune diseases. MSC&#8208;sEVs&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 exhibits an impressive ability to regulate various activated immune cells to an immunosuppressed state in vitro. More importantly, in dextran sulfate sodium&#8208;induced ulcerative colitis (UC) and imiquimod&#8208;induced psoriasis mouse models, a significantly high accumulation of MSC&#8208;sEVs&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 is observed in the inflamed tissues compared to the PD&#8208;L1+ MSCs. Therapeutic efficiency in both UC and psoriasis mouse disease models is demonstrated using MSC&#8208;sEVs&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 to reshape the inflammatory ecosystem in the local immune context. A technology is developed using MSC&#8208;sEVs&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 as a natural delivery platform for autoimmune diseases treatment with high clinical potential.

         <title>Digital Light Processing Based Bioprinting with Composable Gradients</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Digital Light Processing based (bio)printing system is developed, integrating a microfluidic mixer for the generation of composable gradients of desired (bio)inks on the fly. Various planar and volumetric structures exhibiting continual gradients of materials, cell densities, growth factor concentrations, hydrogel stiffness, and porosities in horizontal and/or vertical direction, are exemplified, suggesting the promising potential of the technology toward biomedical applications.








Abstract
Recapitulation of complex tissues signifies a remarkable challenge and, to date, only a few approaches have emerged that can efficiently reconstruct necessary gradients in 3D constructs. This is true even though mimicry of these gradients is of great importance to establish the functionality of engineered tissues and devices. Here, a composable&#8208;gradient Digital Light Processing (DLP)&#8208;based (bio)printing system is developed, utilizing the unprecedented integration of a microfluidic mixer for the generation of either continual or discrete gradients of desired (bio)inks in real time. Notably, the precisely controlled gradients are composable on&#8208;the&#8208;fly by facilely by adjusting the (bio)ink flow ratios. In addition, this setup is designed in such a way that (bio)ink waste is minimized when exchanging the gradient (bio)inks, further enhancing this time&#8208; and (bio)ink&#8208;saving strategy. Various planar and 3D structures exhibiting continual gradients of materials, of cell densities, of growth factor concentrations, of hydrogel stiffness, and of porosities in horizontal and/or vertical direction, are exemplified. The composable fabrication of multifunctional gradients strongly supports the potential of the unique bioprinting system in numerous biomedical applications.

         <title>Textured Electrodes: Manipulating Built&#8208;In Crystallographic Heterogeneity of Metal Electrodes via Severe Plastic Deformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The large crystallographic heterogeneity, e.g., broad orientational distribution, characteristic of commercial metal foils results in rough electrodeposit morphology in either metal plating/stripping processes. An accumulative roll bonding (ARB) methodology is reported to achieve uniform crystallographic control on macroscopic materials. Electrochemical analysis shows that ARB can produce large improvements in reversibility of metal anodes.








Abstract
Control of crystallography of metal electrodeposit films has recently emerged as a key to achieving long operating lifetimes in next&#8208;generation batteries. It is reported that the large crystallographic heterogeneity, e.g., broad orientational distribution, that appears characteristic of commercial metal foils, results in rough morphology upon plating/stripping. On this basis, an accumulative roll bonding (ARB) methodology&#8212;a severe plastic deformation process&#8212;is developed. Zn metal is used as a first example to interrogate the concept. It is demonstrated that the ARB process is highly effective in achieving uniform crystallographic control on macroscopic materials. After the ARB process, the Zn grains exhibit a strong (002) texture (i.e., [002]Zn//ND). The texture transitions from a classical bipolar pattern to a nonclassical unipolar pattern under large nominal strain eliminate the orientational heterogeneity of the foil. The strongly (002)&#8208;textured Zn remarkably improves the plating/stripping performance by nearly two orders of magnitude under practical conditions. The performance improvements are readily scaled to achieve pouch&#8208;type full batteries that deliver exceptional reversibility. The ARB process can, in principle, be applied to any metal chemistry to achieve similar crystallographic uniformity, provided the appropriate temperature and accumulated strains are employed. This concept is evaluated using commercial Li and Na foils, which, unlike Zn (HCP), are BCC crystals. The simple process for creating strong textures in both hexagonal and cubic metals and illustrating the critical role such built&#8208;in crystallography plays underscores opportunities for developing highly reversible thin metal anodes (e.g., hexagonal Zn, Mg, and cubic Li, Na, Ca, Al).

         <title>Spatiotemporally Controllable Distribution of Combination Therapeutics in Solid Tumors by Dually Modified Bacteria</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methods capable of distributing antitumor therapeutics uniformly and durably throughout an entire tumor would be of great significance in maximizing their treatment efficacy but have proven to be extremely challenging. In this work, bacteria&#8208;mediated spatiotemporally controllable distribution of combination therapeutics is described in solid tumors, which can reprogram the immune microenvironment for optimizing antitumor efficacy.








Abstract
Methods capable of distributing antitumor therapeutics uniformly and durably throughout an entire tumor would be of great significance in maximizing their treatment efficacy, but they have proven to be extremely challenging. Here, bacteria&#8208;mediated spatiotemporally controllable distribution of combination therapeutics in solid tumors is reported to reprogram the immune microenvironment for optimizing antitumor efficacy. By combining synthetic biology and interfacial chemistry, bacteria are inside and outside concurrently modified to express photothermal melanin and to attach immune checkpoint inhibitors on their surface. Due to the nature of bacteria to colonize the hypoxia intratumoral environment, both therapeutic agents can be distributed homogenously and lastingly in tumors during ex vivo human and in vivo mouse studies. Spatiotemporally controllable localization of melanin can repeatedly generate a moderate yet uniform heating of the tumor upon light exposure in a broad treatment window. Combination with similarly localized inhibitors elicits a dual photothermally stimulated and checkpoint&#8208;blockade&#8208;mediated immune activation effect, synergistically reprogramming the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Therapeutic values are demonstrated by significantly inhibited tumor growth and prolonged survival of mice in both subcutaneous and orthotopic murine models. Colonization of dually modified bacteria paves an avenue for spatiotemporally controllable distribution of therapeutic drugs in solid tumors.

         <title>Exploring the Pb1&#8722;xSrxHfO3 System and Potential for High Capacitive Energy Storage Density and Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structural and electrical properties of antiferroelectric PbHfO3 and &#8220;potentially&#8221; ferroelectric SrHfO3 are explored. Further, the energy&#8208;storage properties of the solid solution Pb1&#8722;xSrxHfO3 (0 &#8804; x&#160;&lt;&#160;1) films are probed. An optimum strontium content is identified that leads to increased electric&#8208;breakdown strength and decreased hysteresis&#8208;loss in PbHfO3 resulting in concurrent enhancement of the capacitive energy storage density and efficiency.








Abstract
The hafnate perovskites PbHfO3 (antiferroelectric) and SrHfO3 (&#8220;potential&#8221; ferroelectric) are studied as epitaxial thin films on SrTiO3 (001) substrates with the added opportunity of observing a morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) in the Pb1&#8722;xSrxHfO3 system. The resulting (240)&#8208;oriented PbHfO3 (Pba2) films exhibited antiferroelectric switching with a saturation polarization &#8776;53 &#181;C cm&#8722;2 at 1.6 MV cm&#8722;1, weak&#8208;field dielectric constant &#8776;186 at 298 K, and an antiferroelectric&#8208;to&#8208;paraelectric phase transition at &#8776;518 K. (002)&#8208;oriented SrHfO3 films exhibited neither ferroelectric behavior nor evidence of a polar P4mm phase . Instead, the SrHfO3 films exhibited a weak&#8208;field dielectric constant &#8776;25 at 298 K and no signs of a structural transition to a polar phase as a function of temperature (77&#8211;623 K) and electric field (&#8211;3 to 3 MV cm&#8722;1). While the lack of ferroelectric order in SrHfO3 removes the potential for MPB, structural and property evolution of the Pb1&#8722;xSrxHfO3 (0 &#8804; x&#160;&lt;&#160;1) system is explored. Strontium alloying increased the electric&#8208;breakdown strength (EB) and decreased hysteresis loss, thus enhancing the capacitive energy storage density (Ur) and efficiency (&#951;). The composition, Pb0.5Sr0.5HfO3 produced the best combination of EB&#160;= 5.12&#160;&#177; 0.5 MV cm&#8722;1, Ur&#160;= 77&#160;&#177; 5 J cm&#8722;3, and &#951;&#160;= 97&#160;&#177; 2%, well out&#8208;performing PbHfO3 and other antiferroelectric oxides.

         <title>Wafer&#8208;Scale Electroactive Nanoporous Silicon: Large and Fully Reversible Electrochemo&#8208;Mechanical Actuation in Aqueous Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
For large&#8208;scale nanoporous silicon cantilevers in aqueous electrolytes, with laser cantilever bending experiments, electrosorption&#8208;induced mechanical stress generation of up to 600&#8201;kPa that is reversible and adjustable at will by low operation voltages of 1&#8201;V is demonstrated. A comparison with planar silicon surfaces reveals mechanistic insights on the observed electrocapillarity upon ion adsorption and desorption.








Abstract
Nanoporosity in silicon results in interface&#8208;dominated mechanics, fluidics, and photonics that are often superior to the ones of the bulk material. However, their active control, for example, by electronic stimuli, is challenging due to the absence of intrinsic piezoelectricity in the base material. Here, for large&#8208;scale nanoporous silicon cantilevers wetted by aqueous electrolytes, electrosorption&#8208;induced mechanical stress generation of up to 600&#8201;kPa that is reversible and adjustable at will by potential variations of &#8776;1&#8201;V is shown. Laser cantilever bending experiments in combination with in operando voltammetry and step coulombmetry allow this large electro&#8208;actuation to be traced to the concerted action of 100 billions of parallel nanopores per square centimeter cross&#8208;section and determination of the capacitive charge&#8211;stress coupling parameter upon ion adsorption and desorption as well as the intimately related stress actuation dynamics for perchloric and isotonic saline solutions. A comparison with planar silicon surfaces reveals mechanistic insights on the observed electrocapillarity (Hellmann&#8211;Feynman interactions) with respect to the importance of oxide formation and wall roughness on the single&#8208;nanopore scale. The observation of robust electrochemo&#8208;mechanical actuation in a mainstream semiconductor with wafer&#8208;scale, self&#8208;organized nanoporosity opens up novel opportunities for on&#8208;chip integrated stress generation and actuorics at exceptionally low operation&#160;voltages.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional sensor with high performance is fabricated from the hydrogen bond cross&#8208;linked network based on carboxylic styrene butadiene rubber (XSBR) and sericin&#8208;modified carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The sensor is a good fit for the basic requirements of full&#8208;human motion detection and real&#8208;time temperature variation monitoring, providing a promising route to develop wearable artificial intelligence in human activity and health.








Abstract
Recently, flexible wearable electronic devices have attracted immense interest as an alternative for conventional rigid metallic conductors in personal healthcare monitoring, human motion detection, and sensory skins, owing to their intrinsic characteristics. However, the practical applications of most wearable sensors are generally limited by their poor stretchability and sensitivity, unsatisfactory strength, lower conductivity, and single sensory function. Here a hydrogen bond cross&#8208;linked network based on carboxylic styrene butadiene rubber (XSBR) and hydrophilic sericin (SS) non&#8208;covalently modified carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is rationally designed and then fabricated into multi&#8208;functional sensors. The resultant versatile sensors are able to detect both weak and large deformations, which owns a low detection limit of 1% strain, high stretchability up to 217%, superior strength of 12.58 MPa, high sensitivity with a gauge factor up to 25.98, high conductivity of 0.071 S m&#8722;1, and lower percolation threshold of 0.504 wt%. Moreover, the prepared sensors also possess an impressively thermal response (0.01636 &#176;C&#8722;1) and realize the application in the measurement of human body temperature. The multifunctional and scalable XSBR/SSCNT sensor with the integrated tracking capabilities of real&#8208;time and in situ physiological signals, providing a promising route to develop wearable artificial intelligence in human health and sporting applications.

         <title>Cycloruthenated Self&#8208;Assembly with Metabolic Inhibition to Efficiently Overcome Multidrug Resistance in Cancers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cyclometalated Ru(II) complex, RuZ, is reported to be able to self&#8208;assemble and accumulate in high levels in multi&#8208;drug resistant cancer cells. RuZ significantly increases cancer cell death by dual metabolic inhibition and interactions with multiple biological targets. Overall, the results suggest that RuZ could represent a potential treatment for cancers including multi&#8208;drug resistant cancers.








Abstract
The synthesis and the evaluation of the efficacy of a cycloruthenated complex, RuZ, is reported, to overcome multi&#8208;drug resistance (MDR) in cancer cells. RuZ can self&#8208;assemble into nanoaggregates in the cell culture medium, resulting in a high intracellular concentration of RuZ in MDR cancer cells. The self&#8208;assembly significantly decreases oxygen consumption and inhibits glycolysis, which decreases cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels. The decrease in ATP levels and its low affinity for the ABCB1 and ABCG2 transporters (which mediate MDR) significantly increase the retention of RuZ by MDR cancer cells. Furthermore, RuZ increases cellular oxidative stress, inducing DNA damage, and, in combination with the aforementioned effects of RuZ, increases the apoptosis of cancer cells. Proteomic profiling analysis suggests that the RuZ primarily decreases the expression of proteins that mediate glycolysis and aerobic mitochondrial respiration and increases the expression of proteins involved in apoptosis. RuZ inhibits the proliferation of 35 cancer cell lines, of which 7 cell lines are resistant to clinical drugs. It is also active in doxorubicin&#8208;resistant MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231/Adr mouse tumor xenografts. To the best of our&#160;knowledge, the results are the first to show that self&#8208;assembled cycloruthenated complexes are efficacious in inhibiting the growth of MDR cancer cells.

         <title>Self&#8208;Complementary Zwitterionic Peptides Direct Nanoparticle Assembly and Enable Enzymatic Selection of Endocytic Pathways</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzyme&#8208;activated assembly of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) using the zwitterionic peptide, LRGD, as a self&#8208;complementary, electrostatic binding moiety is illustrated. PEGylated peptide ligands containing the LRGD sequence are immobilized on the AuNPs. Cancer&#8208;specific enzymes, matrix metalloproteinase&#8208;9 (MMP&#8208;9), cleave the peptide ligands and subsequently unveil the LRGD moieties that promote multivalent, electrostatic interactions, leading to the assembly of the AuNPs.








Abstract
Supramolecular self&#8208;assembly in biological systems holds promise to convert and amplify disease&#8208;specific signals to physical or mechanical signals that can direct cell fate. However, it remains challenging to design physiologically stable self&#8208;assembling systems that demonstrate tunable and predictable behavior. Here, the use of zwitterionic tetrapeptide modalities to direct nanoparticle assembly under physiological conditions is reported. The self&#8208;assembly of gold nanoparticles can be activated by enzymatic unveiling of surface&#8208;bound zwitterionic tetrapeptides through matrix metalloprotease&#8208;9 (MMP&#8208;9), which is overexpressed by cancer cells. This robust nanoparticle assembly is achieved by multivalent, self&#8208;complementary interactions of the zwitterionic tetrapeptides. In cancer cells that overexpress MMP&#8208;9, the nanoparticle assembly process occurs near the cell membrane and causes size&#8208;induced selection of cellular uptake mechanism, resulting in diminished cell growth. The enzyme responsiveness, and therefore, indirectly, the uptake route of the system can be programmed by customizing the peptide sequence: a simple inversion of the two amino acids at the cleavage site completely inactivates the enzyme responsiveness, self&#8208;assembly, and consequently changes the endocytic pathway. This robust self&#8208;complementary, zwitterionic peptide design demonstrates the use of enzyme&#8208;activated electrostatic side&#8208;chain patterns as powerful and customizable peptide modalities to program nanoparticle self&#8208;assembly and alter cellular response in biological context.

         <title>Transfer&#8208;Enabled Fabrication of Graphene Wrinkle Arrays for Epitaxial Growth of AlN Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the assistance of the transfer medium that has poor wettability on the corrugated surface of graphene, the graphene wrinkle arrays are successfully fabricated without altering the crystalline orientation of entire graphene films, which is promising for numerous applications. This work opens up a new way for periodically modifying the surface properties of graphene for epitaxial growth of AlN films.








Abstract
Formation of graphene wrinkle arrays can periodically alter the electrical properties and chemical reactivity of graphene, which is promising for numerous applications. However, large&#8208;area fabrication of graphene wrinkle arrays remains unachievable with a high density and defined orientations, especially on rigid substrates.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Formation of graphene wrinkle arrays can periodically alter the electrical properties and chemical reactivity of graphene, which is promising for numerous applications. However, large-area fabrication of graphene wrinkle arrays remains unachievable with a high density and defined orientations, especially on rigid substrates. Herein, relying on the understanding of the formation mechanism of transfer-related graphene wrinkles, the graphene wrinkle arrays are fabricated without altering the crystalline orientation of entire graphene films. The choice of the transfer medium that has poor wettability on the corrugated surface of graphene is proven to be the key for the formation of wrinkles. This work provides a deep understanding of formation process of transfer-related graphene wrinkles and opens up a new way for periodically modifying the surface properties of graphene for potential applications, including direct growth of AlN epilayers and deep ultraviolet light emitting diodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Breaking the Efficiency Limit of Deep&#8208;Blue Fluorescent OLEDs Based on Anthracene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation (TTA) process can recycle nonradiative triplet excitons to radiative singlet excitons and enhance the efficiency of fluorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Conventionally, the theoretical limit of delayed emission ratio by the TTA process is known to be 37.5% in anthracene&#8208;based molecules. In this work, 48% of delayed emission ratio is achieved by TTA with carefully designed blue OLEDs.








Abstract
Triplet harvesting is important for the realization of high&#8208;efficiency fluorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation (TTA) is one triplet&#8208;harvesting strategy. However, for blue&#8208;emitting anthracene derivatives, the theoretical maximum radiative singlet&#8208;exciton ratio generated from the TTA process is known to be 15% in addition to the initially generated singlets of 25%, which is insufficient for high&#8208;efficiency fluorescent devices. In this study, nearly 25% of the radiative singlet&#8208;exciton ratio is realized by TTA using an anthracene derivative, breaking the theoretical limit. As a result, efficient deep&#8208;blue TTA fluorescent devices are developed, exhibiting external quantum efficiencies of 10.2% and 8.6% with Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage color coordinates of (0.134, 0.131) and (0.137, 0.076), respectively. The theoretical model provided herein explains the experimental results considering both the TTA and reverse intersystem crossing to a singlet state from higher triplet states formed by the TTA, clearly demonstrating that the radiative singlet ratio generated from TTA can reach 37.5% (total radiative singlet&#8208;exciton ratio: 62.5%), well above 15% (total 40%), despite the molecule having S1, T2&#160;&lt;&#160;2T1&#160;&lt; Q1 energy levels, which will lead to the development of high&#8208;efficiency fluorescent OLEDs with external quantum efficiencies exceeding 28% if the outcoupling efficiency is 45%.

         <title>Viologen&#8208;Immobilized 2D Polymer Film Enabling Highly Efficient Electrochromic Device for Solar&#8208;Powered Smart Window</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fully crystalline viologen&#8208;immobilized 2D polymer (V2DP) film is synthesized, which enables high utilization of viologen moieties and fast ion transport. On this basis, the as&#8208;fabricated V2DP&#8208;based ECDs exhibit a rapid switching speed, and a high coloration efficiency (989 cm2 C&#8722;1). Furthermore, the highly efficient V2DP ECDs are vertically integrated with transparent solar cells, thereby generating energy&#8208;saving EC window systems.








Abstract
Electrochromic devices (ECDs) have emerged as a unique class of optoelectronic devices for the development of smart windows. However, current ECDs typically suffer from low coloration efficiency (CE) and high energy consumption, which have thus hindered their practical applications, especially as components in solar&#8208;powered EC windows. Here, the high&#8208;performance ECDs with a fully crystalline viologen&#8208;immobilized 2D polymer (V2DP) thin film as the color&#8208;switching layer is demonstrated. The high density of vertically oriented pore channels (pore size &#8776; 4.5&#160;nm; pore density &#8776; 5.8 &#215; 1016 m&#8208;2) in the synthetic V2DP film enables high utilization of redox&#8208;active viologen moieties and benefits for Li+ ion diffusion/transport. As a result, the as&#8208;fabricated ECDs achieve a rapid switching speed (coloration, 2.8 s; bleaching, 1.2 s), and a high CE (989 cm2 C&#8208;1), and low energy consumption (21.1 &#181;W cm&#8208;2). Moreover, it is managed to fabricate transmission&#8208;tunable, self&#8208;sustainable EC window prototypes by vertically integrating the V2DP ECDs with transparent solar cells. This work sheds light on designing electroactive 2D polymers with molecular precision for optoelectronics and paves a practical route toward developing self&#8208;powered EC windows to offset the electricity consumption of buildings.

         <title>Universal Existence of Localized Single&#8208;Photon Emitters in the Perovskite Film of All&#8208;Inorganic CsPbBr3 Microcrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;photon emitters are universally observed from all&#8208;inorganic perovskite films at the cryogenic temperature, owing to local thickness variations of the composing CsPbBr3 microcrystals and the resulting low potential&#8208;energy regions. The discovery of such novel emitting species in a perovskite film, with the enriched structure&#8211;property relationship, will impart significant influences on the advancement of relevant optoelectronic devices and quantum&#8208;light sources.








Abstract
All&#8208;inorganic halide perovskites have drawn a lot of research attention very recently owing to their potential solution to the instability issue currently faced by the organic&#8211;inorganic counterparts. Meanwhile, the halide perovskites in a solid film are manifested as microscale morphologies whose functionalities are unavoidably affected by the interior or exterior presence of various nanoscale entities. Here all&#8208;inorganic solid films are fabricated with varying densities of single CsPbBr3 microcrystals, showing that very sharp photoluminescence peaks can be universally observed at 4 K with the linewidths being as narrow as hundreds of &#956;eV. The single&#8208;photon emission nature is confirmed for such a photoluminescence peak, whose intensity is completely quenched above &#8776;30&#160;K to suggest its possible origin from a low potential&#8208;energy region of the single microcrystal. The discovery of such a novel emitting species in halide perovskites, with the enriched structure&#8211;property relationship, will surely impart significant influences on the advancement of relevant optoelectronic devices and quantum&#8208;light sources.

         <title>Synthesis of Pd3Sn and PdCuSn Nanorods with L12 Phase for Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic Ethanol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
L12 PdCuSn, L12 Pd3Sn, and fcc Pd3Sn nanorods are controlled synthesized using a facile, one&#8208;pot, wet&#8208;chemical method. The as&#8208;synthesized ternary L12 PdCuSn nanorods exhibit a remarkable electrocatalytic activity toward the ethanol oxidation reaction in alkaline media with better performance compared to the L12 Pd3Sn nanorods, fcc Pd3Sn nanorods, and the commercial Pd/C catalyst.








Abstract
The crystal phase of nanomaterials is one of the key parameters determining their physicochemical properties and performance in various applications. However, it still remains a great challenge to synthesize nanomaterials with different crystal phases while maintaining the same composition, size, and morphology. Here, a facile, one&#8208;pot, wet&#8208;chemical method is reported to synthesize Pd3Sn nanorods with comparable size and morphology but different crystal phases, that is, an ordered intermetallic and a disordered alloy with L12 and face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) phases, respectively. The crystal phase of the as&#8208;synthesized Pd3Sn nanorods is easily tuned by altering the types of tin precursors and solvents. Moreover, the approach can also be used to synthesize ternary PdCuSn nanorods with the L12 crystal phase. When used as electrocatalysts, the L12 Pd3Sn nanorods exhibit superior electrocatalytic performance toward the ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) compared to their fcc counterpart. Impressively, compared to the L12 Pd3Sn nanorods, the ternary L12 PdCuSn nanorods exhibit more enhanced electrocatalytic performance toward the EOR, yielding a high mass current density up to 6.22 A mgPd&#8722;1, which is superior to the commercial Pd/C catalyst and among the best reported Pd&#8208;based EOR electrocatalysts.

&lt;/sub&gt; Pd&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Sn, and &lt;i&gt;fcc&lt;/i&gt; Pd&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Sn nanorods are controlled synthesized using a facile, one-pot, wet-chemical method. The as-synthesized ternary &lt;i&gt;L1&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; PdCuSn nanorods exhibit a remarkable electrocatalytic activity toward the ethanol oxidation reaction in alkaline media with better performance compared to the &lt;i&gt;L1&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; Pd&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Sn nanorods, &lt;i&gt;fcc&lt;/i&gt; Pd&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Sn nanorods, and the commercial Pd/C catalyst.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crystal phase of nanomaterials is one of the key parameters determining their physicochemical properties and performance in various applications. However, it still remains a great challenge to synthesize nanomaterials with different crystal phases while maintaining the same composition, size, and morphology. Here, a facile, one-pot, wet-chemical method is reported to synthesize Pd&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Sn nanorods with comparable size and morphology but different crystal phases, that is, an ordered intermetallic and a disordered alloy with &lt;i&gt;L1&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; and face-centered cubic (&lt;i&gt;fcc&lt;/i&gt;) phases, respectively. The crystal phase of the as-synthesized Pd&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Sn nanorods is easily tuned by altering the types of tin precursors and solvents. Moreover, the approach can also be used to synthesize ternary PdCuSn nanorods with the &lt;i&gt;L1&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; crystal phase. When used as electrocatalysts, the &lt;i&gt;L1&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; Pd&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Sn nanorods exhibit superior electrocatalytic performance toward the ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) compared to their &lt;i&gt;fcc&lt;/i&gt; counterpart. Impressively, compared to the &lt;i&gt;L1&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; Pd&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Sn nanorods, the ternary &lt;i&gt;L1&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; PdCuSn nanorods exhibit more enhanced electrocatalytic performance toward the EOR, yielding a high mass current density up to 6.22 A mg&lt;sub&gt;Pd&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is superior to the commercial Pd/C catalyst and among the best reported Pd-based EOR electrocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ratiometric FRET Encoded Hierarchical ZrMOF&#8202;@&#8202;Au Cluster for Ultrasensitive Quantifying MicroRNA In Vivo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The developed probes enable the ultrasensitive quantifying microRNA with zeptomolar level and the distinct imaging&#8208;based monitoring of cancer marker miR&#8208;21 both in living cells and in vivo, which offers new avenues for simultaneous diagnoses and treatments of early&#8208;stage cancers.








Abstract
Here, Zirconium metal&#8722;organic frameworks&#8202;@&#8202;gold (ZrMOF&#8202;@&#8202;Au) cluster architectures have been fabricated and then functionalized with two fluorescent dyes (Quasar [QS] and Cyanine5.5 [Cy5.5]) through deoxyribonucleic acid hybridization, to form a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) encoded ZrMOF&#8202;&#8202;@&#8202;&#8202;Au&#8208;QS/Cy5.5 complex. In the presence of the target intracellular microRNA (miR)&#8208;21, the fluorescence of Cy5.5 at 705&#160;nm (F705) decreases and the fluorescence of QS at 665&#160;nm (F665) increases when Cy5.5 is released from the surface of ZrMOF&#8202;&#8202;@&#8202;&#8202;Au&#8208;QS/Cy5.5. The change in the fluorescence ratio (F705/F665) shows an outstanding linear range of 0.006&#8211;67.9 amol/ngRNA, and the limit of detection is 4.51 zmol/ngRNA in living cells. The high ratio loading of nucleic acid on surface of ZrMOF&#8202;@&#8202;Au cluster and two fluorescence encoded signal enables better sensitivity and reliability. Zeptomolar sensitivity and good linearity against target affords distinct imaging&#8208;based monitoring of the cancer marker miR&#8208;21 both in living cells and in vivo. At the same time, the architecture displays remarkable photothermal conversion efficiency (53.7%) and gives rise to outstanding therapy ability in vivo. This strategy offers new avenues for the intelligent quantification of miRNAs for simultaneous diagnoses and treatments of early&#8208;stage cancers.

         <title>Designing a Zn&#8211;Ag Catalyst Matrix and Electrolyzer System for CO2 Conversion to CO and Beyond</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalysts, electrodes, and membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) are developed for the electrocatalytic conversion of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO and beyond. The system consists of highly porous Ag dispersed in a Zn matrix, which leads to high CO2 utilization as described by multiphysics modeling. Coupling to microbiology allows for further upgrading to multicarbon products.








Abstract
CO2 emissions can be transformed into high&#8208;added&#8208;value commodities through CO2 electrocatalysis; however, efficient low&#8208;cost electrocatalysts are needed for global scale&#8208;up. Inspired by other emerging technologies, the authors report the development of a gas diffusion electrode containing highly dispersed Ag sites in a low&#8208;cost Zn matrix. This catalyst shows unprecedented Ag mass activity for CO production: &#8722;614&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 0.17&#160;mg&#160;of Ag. Subsequent electrolyte engineering demonstrates that halide anions can further improve stability and activity of the Zn&#8211;Ag catalyst, outperforming pure Ag and Au. Membrane electrode assemblies are constructed and coupled to a microbial process that converts the CO to acetate and ethanol. Combined, these concepts present pathways to design catalysts and systems for CO2 conversion toward sought&#8208;after products.

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Metal&#8208;Enabled Mechanical&#8208;Energy&#8208;Induced CO2 Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
With mechanical energy as the stimulus, CO2 is converted into solid carbon and O2 in a liquid&#8208;metal&#8208;based reaction system. Using the synergism of Ga nanodroplets and Ag&#8211;Ga nanorods, CO2 conversion proceeds through the triboelectrochemical reaction on Ga, while the Ag&#8211;Ga rods ensure the system's sustainability. This is achieved at a remarkably low energy consumption and high efficiency.








Abstract
A green carbon capture and conversion technology offering scalability and economic viability for mitigating CO2 emissions is reported. The technology uses suspensions of gallium liquid metal to reduce CO2 into carbonaceous solid products and O2 at near room temperature. The nonpolar nature of the liquid gallium interface allows the solid products to instantaneously exfoliate, hence keeping active sites accessible. The solid co&#8208;contributor of silver&#8211;gallium rods ensures a cyclic sustainable process. The overall process relies on mechanical energy as the input, which drives nano&#8208;dimensional triboelectrochemical reactions. When a gallium/silver fluoride mix at 7:1 mass ratio is employed to create the reaction material, 92% efficiency is obtained at a remarkably low input energy of 230 kWh (excluding the energy used for dissolving CO2) for the capture and conversion of a tonne of CO2. This green technology presents an economical solution for CO2 emissions.

         <title>Manipulating Color Emission in 2D Hybrid Perovskites by Fine Tuning Halide Segregation: A Transparent Green Emitter</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlled halide substitution in low&#8208;dimensional hybrid perovskites is an effective strategy to vary the material bandgap, obtaining a palette of light emitters, whereby transparent thin films emitting in the green are realized. By fine&#8208;tuning the halide content, nanoscale phase segregation happens, resulting in a controlled nanoscale spatial distribution of recombination centers.








Abstract
Halide perovskite materials offer an ideal playground for easily tuning their color and, accordingly, the spectral range of their emitted light. In contrast to common procedures, this work demonstrates that halide substitution in Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskites not only progressively modulates the bandgap, but it can also be a powerful tool to control the nanoscale phase segregation&#8212;by adjusting the halide ratio and therefore the spatial distribution of recombination centers. As a result, thin films of chloride&#8208;rich perovskite are engineered&#8212;which appear transparent to the human eye&#8212;with controlled tunable emission in the green. This is due to a rational halide substitution with iodide or bromide leading to a spatial distribution of phases where the minor component is responsible for the tunable emission, as identified by combined hyperspectral photoluminescence imaging and elemental mapping. This work paves the way for the next generation of highly tunable transparent emissive materials, which can be used as light&#8208;emitting pixels in advanced and low&#8208;cost optoelectronics.

In contrast to common procedures, this work demonstrates that halide substitution in Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskites not only progressively modulates the bandgap, but it can also be a powerful tool to control the nanoscale phase segregation&#8212;by adjusting the halide ratio and therefore the spatial distribution of recombination centers. As a result, thin films of chloride-rich perovskite are engineered&#8212;which appear transparent to the human eye&#8212;with controlled tunable emission in the green. This is due to a rational halide substitution with iodide or bromide leading to a spatial distribution of phases where the minor component is responsible for the tunable emission, as identified by combined hyperspectral photoluminescence imaging and elemental mapping. This work paves the way for the next generation of highly tunable transparent emissive materials, which can be used as light-emitting pixels in advanced and low-cost optoelectronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Semiconducting mesocrystalline bulk polymer specimens are demonstrated exhibiting near&#8208;intrinsic properties using channel&#8208;die pressing. Predominant edge&#8208;on orientation is obtained for hole&#8208; and electron&#8208;transporting polymer semicnductors throughout 2 mm&#8208;thick/wide samples. This persistent mesocrystalline arrangement at macroscopic scales allows reliable evaluation of the electronic charge&#8208;transport anisotropy predicted along all three crystallographic axes, without the need to grow single crystals.








Abstract
Semiconducting mesocrystalline bulk polymer specimens that exhibit near&#8208;intrinsic properties using channel&#8208;die pressing are demonstrated. A predominant edge&#8208;on orientation is obtained for poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene&#8208;2,5&#8208;diyl) (P3HT) throughout 2 mm&#8208;thick/wide samples. This persistent mesocrystalline arrangement at macroscopic scales allows reliable evaluation of the electronic charge&#8208;transport anisotropy along all three crystallographic axes, with high mobilities found along the &#960;&#8208;stacking. Indeed, charge&#8208;carrier mobilities of up to 2.3 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 are measured along the &#960;&#8208;stack, which are some of the highest mobilities reported for polymers at low charge&#8208;carrier densities (drop&#8208;cast films display mobilities of maximum &#8776;10&#8722;3 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1). The structural coherence also leads to an unusually well&#8208;defined photoluminescence line&#8208;shape characteristic of an H&#8208;aggregate (measured from the surface perpendicular to the materials flow), rather than the typical HJ&#8208;aggregate feature usually found for P3HT. The approach is widely applicable: to electrical conductors and materials used in n&#8208;type devices, such as poly{[N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(2&#8208;octyldodecyl)&#8208;naphthalene&#8208;1,4,5,8&#8208;bis(dicarboximide)&#8208;2,6&#8208;diyl]&#8208;alt&#8208;5,5&#8242;&#8208;(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bithiophene)} (N2200) where the mesocrystalline structure leads to high electron transport along the polymer backbones (&#8776;1.3 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1). This versatility and the broad applicability of channel&#8208;die pressing signifies its promise as a straightforward, readily scalable method to fabricate bulk semiconducting polymer structures at macroscopic scales with properties typically accessible only by the tedious growth of single crystals.

         <title>Lead&#8208;Dominated Hyperfine Interaction Impacting the Carrier Spin Dynamics in Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Building up on the excellent optical properties of perovskite materials, the electron and hole spin dynamics provide fundamental insights into the carrier&#8211;nuclear spin system. In the model perovskite, bulk FA0.9Cs0.1PbI2.8Br0.2, Land&#233; factors, key spin relaxation times, and mechanisms are determined. Optically detected NMR reveals the dominance of the lead spin hyperfine interaction at the top of the valence band.








Abstract
The outstanding optical quality of lead halide perovskites inspires studies of their potential for the optical control of carrier spins as pursued in other materials. Entering largely uncharted territory, time&#8208;resolved pump&#8211;probe Kerr rotation is used to explore the coherent spin dynamics of electrons and holes in bulk formamidinium caesium lead iodine bromide (FA0.9Cs0.1PbI2.8Br0.2) and to determine key parameters characterizing interactions of their spins, such as the g&#8208;factors and relaxation times. The demonstrated long spin dynamics and narrow g&#8208;factor distribution prove the perovskites as promising competitors for conventional semiconductors in spintronics. The dynamic nuclear polarization via spin&#8208;oriented holes is realized and the identification of the lead (207Pb) isotope in optically detected nuclear magnetic resonance proves that the hole&#8211;nuclei interaction is dominated by the lead ions. A detailed theoretical analysis accounting for the specifics of the lead halide perovskite materials allows the evaluation of the underlying hyperfine interaction constants, both for electrons and holes. Recombination and spin dynamics evidence that at low temperatures, photogenerated electrons and holes are localized at different regions of the perovskite crystal, resulting in their long lifetimes up to 44&#160;&#956;s. The findings form the base for the tailored development of spin&#8208;optoelectronic applications for the large family of lead halide perovskites and their&#160;nanostructures.

         <title>Over 21% Efficiency Stable 2D Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pure formamidinum (FA)&#8208;based 2D perovskite solar cells (PSCs) achieve a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.07% (certified over 20%), the highest efficiency for low&#8208;dimensional PSCs (n&#160;&#8804; 10) reported to date, together with the improved device stability. The high&#8208;efficiency device exhibits a narrowed bandgap and unique 2D&#8211;3D intermixing phase distribution for improved light absorption and superior charge transport.








Abstract
Owing to their insufficient light absorption and charge transport, 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) perovskites show relatively low efficiency. In this work, methylammonium (MA), formamidinum (FA), and FA/MA mixed 2D perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are fabricated. Incorporating FA cations extends the absorption range and enhances the light absorption. Optical spectroscopy shows that FA cations substantially increase the portion of 3D&#8208;like phase to 2D phases, and X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) studies reveal that FA&#8208;based 2D perovskite possesses an oblique crystal orientation. Nevertheless, the ultrafast interphase charge transfer results in an extremely long carrier&#8208;diffusion length (&#8776;1.98&#160;&#181;m). Also, chloride additives effectively suppress the yellow &#948;&#8208;phase formation of pure FA&#8208;based 2D PSCs. As a result, both FA/MA mixed and pure FA&#8208;based 2D PSCs exhibit a greatly enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 20%. Specifically, the pure FA&#8208;based 2D PSCs achieve a record PCE of 21.07% (certified at 20%), which is the highest efficiency for low&#8208;dimensional PSCs (n&#160;&#8804; 10) reported to date. Importantly, the FA&#8208;based 2D PSCs retain 97% of their initial efficiency at 85&#160;&#176;C persistent heating after 1500&#160;h. The results unambiguously demonstrate that pure&#8208;FA&#8208;based 2D PSCs are promising for achieving comparable efficiency to 3D perovskites, along with a better device stability.

         <title>Coupling Spin Defects in a Layered Material to Nanoscale Plasmonic Cavities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of plasmonic gap cavities are used to enhance emission from spin defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). The cavities are silver nanocubes&#160;positioned on top of a gold mirror, encapsulating multilayer hBN with embedded boron vacancy spin defects. Nearly an order of magnitude enhancement is demonstrated at room temperature, associated with an efficient optically detected magnetic resonance readout.








Abstract
Spin defects in hexagonal boron nitride, and specifically the negatively charged boron vacancy (VB&#8208;) centers, are emerging candidates for quantum sensing. However, the VB&#8208; defects suffer from low quantum efficiency and, as a result, exhibit weak photoluminescence. In this work, a scalable approach is demonstrated to dramatically enhance the VB&#8208; emission by coupling to a plasmonic gap cavity. The plasmonic cavity is composed of a flat gold surface and a silver cube, with few&#8208;layer hBN flakes positioned in between. Employing these plasmonic cavities, two orders of magnitude are extracted in photoluminescence enhancement associated with a corresponding twofold enhancement in optically detected magnetic resonance contrast. The work will be pivotal to progress in quantum sensing employing 2D materials, and in realization of nanophotonic devices with spin defects in hexagonal boron nitride.

The cavities are silver nanocubes&#160;positioned on top of a gold mirror, encapsulating multilayer hBN with embedded boron vacancy spin defects. Nearly an order of magnitude enhancement is demonstrated at room temperature, associated with an efficient optically detected magnetic resonance readout.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spin defects in hexagonal boron nitride, and specifically the negatively charged boron vacancy (V&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;) centers, are emerging candidates for quantum sensing. However, the V&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; defects suffer from low quantum efficiency and, as a result, exhibit weak photoluminescence. In this work, a scalable approach is demonstrated to dramatically enhance the V&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; emission by coupling to a plasmonic gap cavity. The plasmonic cavity is composed of a flat gold surface and a silver cube, with few-layer hBN flakes positioned in between. Employing these plasmonic cavities, two orders of magnitude are extracted in photoluminescence enhancement associated with a corresponding twofold enhancement in optically detected magnetic resonance contrast. The work will be pivotal to progress in quantum sensing employing 2D materials, and in realization of nanophotonic devices with spin defects in hexagonal boron nitride.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Repeated cold rolling and folding is employed to fabricate a metallurgical composite of sodium&#8211;antimony&#8211;telluride Na2(Sb2/6Te3/6Vac1/6) dispersed in electrochemically active sodium metal, termed &#8220;NST&#8208;Na.&#8221; This new intermetallic has a vacancy&#8208;rich thermodynamically stable face&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic structure and enables state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrochemical performance in widely employed carbonate and ether electrolytes. NST&#8208;Na achieves 100% depth&#8208;of&#8208;discharge (DOD) in 1 m NaPF6 in G2, with 15 mAh cm&#8722;2 at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.4%, for 1000 h&#160;of plating/stripping. Sodium&#8208;metal batteries (SMBs) with NST&#8208;Na and Na3V2(PO4)3&#160;(NVP) or sulfur cathodes give significantly improved energy, cycling, and CE (&gt;99%). An anode&#8208;free battery with NST collector and NVP obtains 0.23% capacity decay per cycle. Imaging and tomography using conventional and cryogenic microscopy (Cryo&#8208;EM) indicate that the sodium metal fills the open space inside the self&#8208;supporting sodiophilic NST skeleton, resulting in dense (pore&#8208;free and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI)&#8208;free) metal deposits with flat surfaces. The baseline Na deposit consists of filament&#8208;like dendrites and &#8220;dead metal&#8221;, intermixed with pores and SEI. Density functional theory calculations show that the uniqueness of NST lies in the thermodynamic stability of the Na atoms (rather than clusters) on its surface that leads to planar wetting, and in its own stability that prevents decomposition during cycling.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Harsh&#8208;Environment&#8208;Resistant GaOX Solar&#8208;Blind Photodetectors via Defect and Doping Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Certain application situations of solar&#8208;blind photodetectors (SBPDs) inevitably face harsh conditions (e.g., high temperature/electronic&#8208;field/radiation). Gallium oxide with an ultrawide bandgap is regarded as one of the most promising materials for SBPDs. Defect and doping engineering, including Ga&#8208;rich design and doping compensation, has been demonstrated as an effective strategy for low&#8208;cost amorphous GaOX to force a way towards harsh&#8208;condition&#8208;resistant SBPDs.








Abstract
Gallium oxide (Ga2O3), with an ultrawide bandgap, is currently regarded as one of the most promising materials for solar&#8208;blind photodetectors (SBPDs), which are greatly demanded in harsh environment, such as space exploration and flame prewarning. However, realization of high&#8208;performance SBPDs with high tolerance toward harsh environments based on low&#8208;cost Ga2O3 material faces great challenges. Here, defect and doping (DD) engineering towards amorphous GaOX (a&#8208;GaOX) has been proposed to obtain ultrasensitive SBPDs for harsh condition application. Serious oxygen deficiency and doping compensation of the engineered a&#8208;GaOX film ensure the high response currents and low dark currents, respectively. Annealing item in nitrogen of DD engineering also incurs the recrystallization of material, formation of nanopores by oxygen escape, and suppression of sub&#8208;bandgap defect states. As a result, the tailored GaOX SBPD based on DD engineering not only harvests a record&#8208;high responsivity rejection ratio (R254 nm/R365 nm) of 1.8&#160;&#215;&#160;107, 102 times higher detectivity, and 2&#160;&#215;&#160;102 times faster decay speed than the control device, but also keeps a high responsivity, high photo&#8208;to&#8208;dark current ratio, and sharp imaging capability even at high temperature (280&#160;&#176;C) or high bias (100&#160;V). The proposed DD engineering provides an effective strategy towards highly harsh&#8208;environment&#8208;resistant GaOX SBPDs.

         <title>Self&#8208;Catalytic Small Interfering RNA Nanocarriers for Synergistic Treatment of Neurodegenerative Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;catalytic siRNA nanocarriers S/Ce&#8208;PABMS with a ceria (CeO2) nanozymes&#8208;mediated rough surface can catalyze the delivery process and amplify the cellular uptake efficiency. The CeO2 nanozymes catalyze excess reactive oxygen species scavenging and cooperate with siSNCA to reduce the formation of &#945;&#8208;syn aggregates in the treatment process. S/Ce&#8208;PABMS exhibit superior synergistic treatment effects and significantly improve dyskinesia of Parkinson's disease mice.








Abstract
Gene therapy has shown great potential for neurodegenerative diseases with complex pathology. However, its therapeutic effect is limited due to the delivery barriers and its own single function. Herein, self&#8208;catalytic small interfering RNA (siRNA) nanocarriers (S/Ce&#8208;PABMS) are developed to catalyze delivery process and treatment process for synergistic treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. On the one hand, the rough surface of the S/Ce&#8208;PABMS mediated by ceria (CeO2) nanozymes can catalyze cellular uptake in the delivery process, so that S/Ce&#8208;PABMS with acetylcholine analogs penetrate the blood&#8211;brain barrier and enter neurons more effectively. On the other hand, the CeO2 nanozymes can catalyze the treatment process by scavenging excess reactive oxygen species, and cooperate with siRNA&#8208;targeting SNCA to decrease the &#945;&#8208;synuclein (&#945;&#8208;syn) aggregation and alleviate the Parkinsonian pathology. Moreover, the S/Ce&#8208;PABMS treatment reduces the number of activated microglia and regulates the release of inflammatory cytokine, thereby relieving neuroinflammation. After treatment with S/Ce&#8208;PABMS, dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease model mice is significantly alleviated. The finding shows that the self&#8208;catalytic nanocarriers, S/Ce&#8208;PABMS, have great potential in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Enabled Phase Transition of Periodic Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strain&#8208;enabled phase transition of stretchable periodic metasurfaces between any two Bravais lattices, which reflect their symmetry, is demonstrated analytically and experimentally. Such transition offers a flexible way to engineer the resonance regime and dispersion relation of metasurfaces. In particular, the strain&#8208;induced symmetry lowering leads to linearly and circularly polarized dichroism, which is demonstrated for information decoding.

Phase transitions are universal in solid&#8208;state matters, as well as in periodic electromagnetic metasurfaces&#8212;the photonic analogues of crystals. Although such transitions dictate the properties of active metasurfaces, universal ways to describe the structure transition of periodic metasurfaces have not yet been established. Here, the authors report the strain&#8208;enabled phase transition (or lattice deformation) of stretchable metasurfaces with the crystallographic description. They analytically and experimentally demonstrate the phase transition of plasmonic lattices between two arbitrary 2D Bravais lattices under certain strain configurations. The strain&#8208;induced symmetry lowering of the structures gives rise to optical anisotropy upon polarization, namely, linearly and circularly polarized dichroism. They further demonstrate the potential of phase transition in information decoding with applied strain. Interpreting the phase transition of metasurfaces from a standpoint of symmetry would accelerate the discovery of emergent properties, and provide a generalizable approach to designing active metasurfaces.

     alt="Strain-Enabled Phase Transition of Periodic Metasurfaces"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strain-enabled phase transition of stretchable periodic metasurfaces between any two Bravais lattices, which reflect their symmetry, is demonstrated analytically and experimentally. Such transition offers a flexible way to engineer the resonance regime and dispersion relation of metasurfaces. In particular, the strain-induced symmetry lowering leads to linearly and circularly polarized dichroism, which is demonstrated for information decoding.

         <title>Investigation of the Effect of 3D Meniscus Geometry on Fluid Dynamics and Crystallization via In Situ Optical Microscopy&#8208;Assisted Mathematical Modeling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 3D geometrical model of the meniscus is attained using high&#8208;speed side&#8208;view and top&#8208;view in situ microscopy, within which a mathematical model for momentum and mass transport is developed. Utilizing 3D meniscus geometry, the underlying mechanism of dendritic growth of small molecule organic semiconductors is elucidated, which is widely applicable to various materials and coating systems.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;based thin&#8208;film solidification is a complex process involving various transport phenomena that are intricately dependent on multiple experimental parameters. The difficulty of analyzing this process experimentally or conducting exact numerical simulation make it challenging to understand, predict, and control the solidification process. In this work, a simple and effective technique to analyze the thin&#8208;film solidification process during solution shearing, based on 3D geometrical model of the meniscus, is proposed. The 3D meniscus geometry, which changes depending on the experimental parameters, is attained using high&#8208;speed side&#8208;view and top&#8208;view in situ microscopy. Thereafter, mass and momentum transport mathematical models are applied to obtain numerical solutions of transport phenomena within the meniscus. Utilizing these results, the underlying mechanism of dendritic growth of small molecule organic semiconductor is elucidated, which has previously been unknown. The 3D meniscus modeling is particularly important for this analysis, as dendrite formation is strongly dependent on the meniscus geometry near the contact line and mass transport variation perpendicular to the coating direction. This technique enables the study of complex relationship between experimental parameters and solidification process, which is widely applicable to various materials and coating systems; whereby, better understanding of thin&#8208;film growth and device performance optimization is possible.

         <title>Strongly Anisotropic Strain&#8208;Tunability of Excitons in Exfoliated ZrSe3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zirconium triselenide is a 2D semiconductor material with an interesting in&#8208;plane anisotropic crystal structure. Here, it is demonstrated that the excitons of this material are very sensitive to uniaxial strains and, interestingly, their tunability strongly depends on the direction along which the uniaxial strain is applied.








Abstract
The effect of uniaxial strain on the band structure of ZrSe3, a semiconducting material with a marked in&#8208;plane structural anisotropy, is studied. By using a modified three&#8208;point bending test apparatus, thin ZrSe3 flakes are subjected to uniaxial strain along different crystalline orientations monitoring the effect of strain on their optical properties through micro&#8208;reflectance spectroscopy. The obtained spectra show excitonic features that blueshift upon uniaxial tension. This shift is strongly dependent on the direction along which the strain is being applied. When the flakes are strained along the b&#8208;axis, the exciton peak shifts at &#8776;60&#8211;95 meV %&#8722;1, while along the a&#8208;axis, the shift only reaches &#8776;0&#8211;15 meV %&#8722;1. Ab initio calculations are conducted to study the influence of uniaxial strain, applied along different crystal directions, on the band structure and reflectance spectra of ZrSe3, exhibiting a remarkable agreement with the experimental results.

Bioprinting
In article number 2107038, Yu Shrike Zhang and co&#8208;workers develop a (bio)printing system based on Digital Light Processing to utilize the integration of a microfluidic mixer for the generation of either continual or discrete gradients of desired (bio)inks in real time. As such, the precisely controlled gradients are composable on&#8208;the&#8208;fly by facilely adjusting the (bio)ink flow ratios, supporting the potential of the platform in numerous biomedical applications.

&lt;p&gt;In article number &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202107038"&gt;2107038&lt;/a&gt;, Yu Shrike Zhang and co-workers develop a (bio)printing system based on Digital Light Processing to utilize the integration of a microfluidic mixer for the generation of either continual or discrete gradients of desired (bio)inks in real time. As such, the precisely controlled gradients are composable on-the-fly by facilely adjusting the (bio)ink flow ratios, supporting the potential of the platform in numerous biomedical applications.

Artificial Biomolecular Condensates
In article number 2104704, Huaimin Wang and co&#8208;workers report a general approach for constructing artificial biomolecular condensates of oligopeptide in living cells. The rationally designed aromatic&#8208;capped peptides can reversibly form a nanofibrous hydrogel with a change of the conformation and morphologies in the lysosome. The formed condensates undergo swelling in the lysosome, leading to lysosomal membrane permeabilization and re&#8208;direction of therapeutic drugs to the target.

Tadf Emitters
Circularly polarized thermally activated delayed fluorescence (CP&#8208;TADF) and multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) properties are integrated into new CPMR&#8208;TADF materials by Xiugang Wu, You&#8208;Xuan Zheng, Weiguo Zhu, Pi&#8208;Tai Chou, and co&#8208;workers, as described in article number 2105080. Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on these CPMR&#8208;TADF emitters attain a three&#8208;in&#8208;one advantage simultaneously: high efficiency, color purity, and circular polarized light.

Anode&#8208;Free Batteries
In article number 2106005, Hui Dong, David Mitlin, and co&#8208;workers report an intermetallic for anode&#8208;free batteries. The winter scene shows a birthday cake with lit candles that are melting: the cake represents the complex structure of a cycled sodium&#8208;metal anode with the protruding candles being the dendrites. A slice, obtained by cryogenic focused ion beam (FIB) microscopy, further reveals the underlying porosity that develops during repeated plating and stripping of the metal. The thick non&#8208;uniform red frosting on the cake represents the unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) that drives the dendrite growth.

Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes
Triplet exciton harvesting via triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation, is known to generate only 40% of the total radiative excitons in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) theoretically. In article number 2100161, Yun&#8208;Hi Kim, Jang&#8208;Joo Kim, and co&#8208;workers realize a total radiative exciton ratio of nearly 50% with a carefully designed anthracene derivative and device structure, breaking the theoretical efficiency limit of OLEDs based on anthracene derivatives.

Electro&#8208;Actuation
In article number 2105923, Manuel Brinker and Patrick Huber report laser cantilever bending experiments that show large and reversible electrosorption&#8208;induced deformation of wafer&#8208;scale nanoporous silicon in aqueous electrolytes (isotonic saline solution) at exceptionally small operation voltages. This paves the way for on&#8208;chip integrated actuation and stress generation, e.g.,  in (bio&#8208;)medical environments, as is illustrated by electro&#8208;mechanical stimulation of living cells.

&lt;p&gt;In article number &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202105923"&gt;2105923&lt;/a&gt;, Manuel Brinker and Patrick Huber report laser cantilever bending experiments that show large and reversible electrosorption-induced deformation of wafer-scale nanoporous silicon in aqueous electrolytes (isotonic saline solution) at exceptionally small operation voltages. This paves the way for on-chip integrated actuation and stress generation, e.g.,  in (bio-)medical environments, as is illustrated by electro-mechanical stimulation of living cells.

Tumor Therapy
In article number 2106606, Nan Qin, Tiger H. Tao, and co&#8208;workers report a heterogenous silk microneedle patch to spatiotemporally and sequentially deliver multiple therapeutic drugs for hemostasis, anti&#8208;angiogenesis, and apoptosis of brain tumor cells. Drug release kinetics are well&#8208;defined by tuning the crosslinking degree of the silk and applying a trigger of transcranial NIR&#8208;light irradiation. This biodegradable patch has potential applications for the clinical treatment of intracranial tumors.

Deep&#8208;UV Photodetectors
High&#8208;performance harsh&#8208;environment&#8208;resistant deep&#8208;UV (DUV) photodetectors have important applications in space exploration and flame prewarning. In article number 2106923, Xiaolong Zhao, Shibing Long, and co&#8208;workers tailor defect/doping engineering based on the low&#8208;cost GaOX to obtain high&#8208;performance DUV detectors. The defect/doping engineering induces recrystallization, doping compensation, and nanopore formation inside the material, giving it great potential for DUV detection in harsh conditions.

         <title>Tin Halide Perovskites: From Fundamental Properties to Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thorough overview is given on the fundamental properties of tin halide perovskites tailored to their application in solar cells. A detailed discussion of the crystal structure, electronic properties, photophysics, and thin&#8208;film crystallization of tin halide perovskites provides a foundation to highlight its exceptional properties and reveals research strategies to improve the performance of tin halide solar cells.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites have unique optical and electrical properties, which make them an excellent class of materials for a broad spectrum of optoelectronic applications. However, it is with photovoltaic devices that this class of materials has reached the apotheosis of popularity. High power conversion efficiencies are achieved with lead&#8208;based compounds, which are toxic to the environment. Tin&#8208;based perovskites are the most promising alternative because of their bandgap close to the optimal value for photovoltaic applications, the strong optical absorption, and good charge carrier mobilities. Nevertheless, the low defect tolerance, the fast crystallization, and the oxidative instability of tin halide perovskites currently limit their efficiency. The aim of this review is to give a detailed overview of the crystallographic, photophysical, and optoelectronic properties of tin&#8208;based perovskite compounds in their multiple forms from 3D to low&#8208;dimensional structures. At the end, recent progress in tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells are reviewed, mainly focusing on the detail of the strategies adopted to improve the device performances. For each subtopic, the current challenges and the outlook are discussed, with the aim to stimulate the community to address the most important issues in a concerted manner.

         <title>Processing of Self&#8208;Healing Polymers for Soft Robotics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Soft robots are inherently safe, but prone to various damage types. Self&#8208;healing polymers address this vulnerability. In this work, the variety of processing techniques of self&#8208;healing polymers for robotics in the literature is reviewed and limitations and opportunities are discussed. Two promising research fields are bridged, and a guide is given toward selecting suitable processing methods based on a self&#8208;healing polymer and the intended soft robotics application.








Abstract
Soft robots are, due to their softness, inherently safe and adapt well to unstructured environments. However, they are prone to various damage types. Self&#8208;healing polymers address this vulnerability. Self&#8208;healing soft robots can recover completely from macroscopic damage, extending their lifetime. For developing healable soft robots, various formative and additive manufacturing methods have been exploited to shape self&#8208;healing polymers into complex structures. Additionally, several novel manufacturing techniques, noted as (re)assembly binding techniques that are specific to self&#8208;healing polymers, have been created. Herein, the wide variety of processing techniques of self&#8208;healing polymers for robotics available in the literature is reviewed, and limitations and opportunities discussed thoroughly. Based on defined requirements for soft robots, these techniques are critically compared and validated. A strong focus is drawn to the reversible covalent and (physico)chemical cross&#8208;links present in the self&#8208;healing polymers that do not only endow healability to the resulting soft robotic components, but are also beneficial in many manufacturing techniques. They solve current obstacles in soft robots, including the formation of robust multi&#8208;material parts, recyclability, and stress relaxation. This review bridges two promising research fields, and guides the reader toward selecting a suitable processing method based on a self&#8208;healing polymer and the intended soft robotics&#160;application.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Driven Biomaterials Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The advancement of machine learning (ML) in materials science has progressed in leaps and bounds and has made a big impact into biomaterials research, ranging from discovery of bioactive chemical moieties, screening and optimization of material properties, to developing materials that interface better with biological systems. There is still untapped potential to integrate with ML for the next frontier in biomaterials.








Abstract
Biomaterials is an exciting and dynamic field, which uses a collection of diverse materials to achieve desired biological responses. While there is constant evolution and innovation in materials with time, biomaterials research has been hampered by the relatively long development period required. In recent years, driven by the need to accelerate materials development, the applications of machine learning in materials science has progressed in leaps and bounds. The combination of machine learning with high&#8208;throughput theoretical predictions and high&#8208;throughput experiments (HTE) has shifted the traditional Edisonian (trial and error) paradigm to a data&#8208;driven paradigm. In this review, each type of biomaterial and their key properties and use cases are systematically discussed, followed by how machine learning can be applied in the development and design process. The discussions are classified according to various types of materials used including polymers, metals, ceramics, and nanomaterials, and implants using additive manufacturing. Last, the current gaps and potential of machine learning to further aid biomaterials discovery and application are also discussed.

         <title>Recent Advances in Fluorinated Graphene from Synthesis to Applications: Critical Review on Functional Chemistry and Structure Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent advances in fluorinated graphene (FG) from the synthesis methods to the broad applications and the relationship between the structures and properties are reviewed in detail. Especially, rational structure engineering and the abundant functional chemistry are the significant directions which are further discussed for the future development of FG.








Abstract
Fluorinated graphene (FG), as an emerging member of the graphene derivatives family, has attracted wide attention on account of its excellent performances and underlying applications. The introduction of a fluorine atom, with the strongest electronegativity (3.98), greatly changes the electron distribution of graphene, resulting in a series of unique variations in optical, electronic, magnetic, interfacial properties and so on. Herein, recent advances in the study of FG from synthesis to applications are introduced, and the relationship between its structure and properties is summarized in detail. Especially, the functional chemistry of FG has been thoroughly analyzed in recent years, which has opened a universal route for the functionalization and even multifunctionalization of FG toward various graphene derivatives, which further broadens its applications. Moreover, from a particular angle, the structure engineering of FG such as the distribution pattern of fluorine atoms and the regulation of interlayer structure when advanced nanotechnology gets involved is summarized. Notably, the elaborated structure engineering of FG is the key factor to optimize the corresponding properties for potential applications, and is also an up&#8208;to&#8208;date research hotspot and future development direction. Finally, perspectives and prospects for the problems and challenges in the study of FG are put forward.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bimetallic Janus nanocrystals feature a side&#8208;by&#8208;side arrangement of two distinct metals divided by a heterogeneous interface. This unique structure allows one to present both metals on the same particle while tailoring the plasmonic coupling and electronic interaction between them, making the structure particularly viable for plasmonic, catalytic, and photocatalytic applications.








Abstract
Bimetallic Janus nanocrystals have received considerable interest in recent years owing to their unique properties and niche applications. The side&#8208;by&#8208;side distribution of two distinct metals provides a flexible platform for tailoring the optical and catalytic properties of nanocrystals. First, a brief introduction to the structural features of bimetallic Janus nanocrystals, followed by an extensive discussion of the synthetic approaches, is given. The strategies and experimental controls for achieving the Janus structure, as well as the mechanistic understandings, are specifically discussed. Then, a number of intriguing properties and applications enabled by the Janus nanocrystals are highlighted. Finally, this article is concluded with future directions and outlooks with respect to both syntheses and applications of this new class of functional nanomaterials.

         <title>Advanced Point&#8208;of&#8208;Care Testing Technologies for Human Acute Respiratory Virus Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The advanced rapid point&#8208;of&#8208;care tests (POCTs), including nucleic acid amplification, optical POCTs, electrochemistry, lateral flow assay, microfluidics, ELISA, and microarray&#8208;based platforms, act figuratively as the Great Wall to the widespread transmission of acute respiratory virus infections by enabling early and rapid detection of these pathogens, as is the case during the current pandemic.








Abstract
The ever&#8208;growing global threats to human life caused by the human acute respiratory virus (RV) infections have cost billions of lives, created a significant economic burden, and shaped society for centuries. The timely response to emerging RVs could save human lives and reduce the medical care burden. The development of RV detection technologies is essential for potentially preventing RV pandemic and epidemics. However, commonly used detection technologies lack sensitivity, specificity, and speed, thus often failing to provide the rapid turnaround times. To address this problem, new technologies are devised to address the performance inadequacies of the traditional methods. These emerging technologies offer improvements in convenience, speed, flexibility, and portability of point&#8208;of&#8208;care test (POCT). Herein, recent developments in POCT are comprehensively reviewed for eight typical acute respiratory viruses. This review discusses the challenges and opportunities of various recognition and detection strategies and discusses these according to their detection principles, including nucleic acid amplification, optical POCT, electrochemistry, lateral flow assays, microfluidics, enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assays, and microarrays. The importance of limits of detection, throughput, portability, and specificity when testing clinical samples in resource&#8208;limited settings is emphasized. Finally, the evaluation of commercial POCT kits for both essential RV diagnosis and clinical&#8208;oriented practices is included.

         <title>Fiber&#8208;Based Biopolymer Processing as a Route toward Sustainability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Plastics sustainability is a growing issue and structural biopolymers from nature (e.g., cellulose, chitin, silk) offer new, long&#8208;term solutions. Recent advances with thermoplastic processing, as well as fibrillation strategies, offer new routes to more competitive processing strategies than traditional solution approaches. Challenges remain with scaling, further insight into mechanisms, use of molecular modeling and plasticizer optimization.








Abstract
Some of the most abundant biomass on earth is sequestered in fibrous biopolymers like cellulose, chitin, and silk.&#160;These types of natural materials offer unique and striking mechanical and functional features that have driven strong interest in their utility for a range of applications, while also matching environmental sustainability needs.&#160;However, these material systems are challenging to process in cost&#8208;competitive ways to compete with synthetic plastics due to the limited options for thermal processing.&#160;This results in the dominance of solution&#8208;based processing for fibrous biopolymers, which presents challenges for scaling, cost, and consistency in outcomes. However, new opportunities to utilize thermal processing with these types of biopolymers, as well as fibrillation approaches, can drive renewed opportunities to bridge this gap between synthetic plastic processing and fibrous biopolymers, while also holding sustainability goals as critical to long&#8208;term successful outcomes.

         <title>Bioinspired and Biomimetic Delivery Platforms for Cancer Vaccines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>

Integration of biomimetic designs into delivery platforms for cancer vaccines can enhance efficacy while retaining good safety profiles, which contributes to expediting the clinical translation of cancer vaccines. A detailed overview of current progress, potential challenges, and future directions of bioinspired delivery platforms for cancer vaccines is provided here.








Abstract
Cancer vaccines aim at eliciting tumor&#8208;specific responses for the immune system to identify and eradicate malignant tumor cells while sparing the normal tissues. Furthermore, cancer vaccines can potentially induce long&#8208;term immunological memory for antitumor responses, preventing metastasis and cancer recurrence, thus presenting an attractive treatment option in cancer immunotherapy. However, clinical efficacy of cancer vaccines has remained low due to longstanding challenges, such as poor immunogenicity, immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, tumor heterogeneity, inappropriate immune tolerance, and systemic toxicity. Recently, bioinspired materials and biomimetic technologies have emerged to play a part in reshaping the field of cancer nanomedicine. By mimicking desirable chemical and biological properties in nature, bioinspired engineering of cancer vaccine delivery platforms can effectively transport therapeutic cargos to tumor sites, amplify antigen and adjuvant bioactivities, and enable spatiotemporal control and on&#8208;demand immunoactivation. As such, integration of biomimetic designs into delivery platforms for cancer vaccines can enhance efficacy while retaining good safety profiles, which contributes to expediting the clinical translation of cancer vaccines. Recent advances in bioinspired delivery platforms for cancer vaccines, existing obstacles faced, as well as insights and future directions for the field are discussed here.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Selectivity and &#8220;Order&#8208;in&#8208;Disorder&#8221; Engineering in Carbon for Durable and Fast Potassium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ defect&#8208;selectivity and &#8220;order&#8208;in&#8208;disorder&#8221; synergetic engineering in carbon materials via a self&#8208;template approach is developed to boost the K+&#8208;storage capacity, rate capability, and long&#8208;term cyclic stability simultaneously. In situ/ex situ characteristics and density functional theory (DFT) calculation demonstrate that carbon&#8208;vacancies possess higher reversibility and faster ion/electron migration kinetics than heteroatom&#8208;defects.








Abstract
Defect&#8208;rich carbon materials possess high gravimetric potassium storage capability due to the abundance of active sites, but their cyclic stability is limited because of the low reversibility of undesirable defects and the deteriorative conductivity. Herein, in situ defect&#8208;selectivity and order&#8208;in&#8208;disorder synergetic engineering in carbon via a self&#8208;template strategy is reported to boost the K+&#8208;storage capacity, rate capability and cyclic stability simultaneously. The defect&#8208;sites are selectively tuned to realize abundant reversible carbon&#8208;vacancies with the sacrifice of poorly reversible heteroatom&#8208;defects through the persistent gas release during pyrolysis. Meanwhile, nanobubbles generated during the pyrolysis serve as self&#8208;templates to induce the surface atom rearrangement, thus in situ embedding nanographitic networks in the defective domains without serious phase separation, which greatly enhances the intrinsic conductivity. The synergetic structure ensures high concentration of reversible carbon&#8208;vacancies and fast charge&#8208;transfer kinetics simultaneously, leading to high reversible capacity (425 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.05 A g&#8722;1), high&#8208;rate (237.4 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1), and superior cyclic stability (90.4% capacity retention from cycle 10 to 400 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1). This work provides a rational and facile strategy to realize the tradeoff between defect&#8208;sites and intrinsic conductivity, and gives deep insights into the mechanism of reversible potassium storage.

         <title>Electrode Engineering in Halide Perovskite Electronics: Plenty of Room at the Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Contact engineering is a prerequisite for achieving desirable functionality and performance of semiconductor electronics, which is particularly critical for organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid halide perovskites due to their ionic nature and highly reactive interfaces. Although the interfaces between perovskites and charge transporting layers have attracted lots of attention due to the photovoltaic and light&#8208;emitting diode applications, achieving reliable perovskite/electrode contacts for electronic devices such as transistors and memories remains as a bottleneck. Herein, we present a critical review on the elusive nature of perovskite/electrode interfaces with a focus on the interfacial electrochemistry effects. The basic guidelines of electrode selection are given for establishing non&#8208;polarized interfaces and optimal energy level alignment for perovskite materials. Furthermore, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategies on interface&#8208;related electrode engineering are reviewed and discussed, which aim at achieving Ohmic transport and eliminating hysteresis in perovskite devices. We also discuss the role and multiple functionalities of self&#8208;assembled monolayers that offer a unique approach toward improving perovskite/electrode contacts. The insights on electrode engineering pave the way to advancing stable and reliable perovskite devices in diverse electronic applications.

         <title>Unraveling Crystallization Mechanisms and Electronic Structure of Phase&#8208;Change Materials by Large&#8208;Scale Ab Initio Simulations</title>

Abstract
Ge&#8211;Sb&#8211;Te (&#8220;GST&#8221;) alloys are leading phase&#8208;change materials for digital memories and neuro&#8208;inspired computing. Upon fast crystallization, these materials form rocksalt&#8208;like phases with large structural and vacancy disorder, leading to an insulating phase at low temperature. Here, we provide a comprehensive description of crystallization, structural disorder, and electronic properties of GeSb2Te4 based on realistic, quantum&#8208;mechanically based (&#8220;ab initio&#8221;) computer simulations with system sizes of more than 1,000 atoms. We show how an analysis of the crystallization mechanism based on the Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP) kernel reveals the evolution of both geometrical and chemical order. We then study the connection between structural and electronic properties of the disordered, as&#8208;crystallized models, which are relevant to the transport properties of GST. Furthermore, we show how antisite defects and extended Sb&#8208;rich motifs can lead to Anderson localization in the conduction band. Beyond memory applications, our findings are therefore more generally relevant to disordered rocksalt&#8208;like chalcogenides that exhibit self&#8208;doping, since they can explain the origin of Anderson insulating behavior in both p&#8208; and n&#8208;doped chalcogenide materials.

         <title>Conductivity Mechanism in Ionic 2D Carbon Nitrides: From Hydrated Ion Motion to Enhanced Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dark and photoinduced charge transport in the metal (M)&#8208;intercalated 2D carbon nitride poly(heptazine imide) (M&#8208;PHI) is investigated, revealing predominantly ionic, humidity&#8208;assisted conductivity. A correlation between ionic conductivity and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity is revealed, which suggests efficient screening of photogenerated charges by mobile ions, leading to prolonged charge&#8208;carrier lifetimes.








Abstract
Carbon nitrides are among the most studied materials for photocatalysis; however, limitations arise from inefficient charge separation and transport within the material. Here, this aspect is addressed in the 2D carbon nitride poly(heptazine imide) (PHI) by investigating the influence of various counterions, such as M = Li+, Na+, K+, Cs+, Ba2+, NH4+, and tetramethyl ammonium, on the material's conductivity and photocatalytic activity. These ions in the PHI pores affect the stacking of the 2D layers, which further influences the predominantly ionic conductivity in M&#8208;PHI. Na&#8208;containing PHI outperforms the other M&#8208;PHIs in various relative humidity (RH) environments (0&#8211;42%RH) in terms of conductivity, likely due to pore&#8208;channel geometry and size of the (hydrated) ion. With increasing RH, the ionic conductivity increases by 4&#8211;5 orders of magnitude (for Na&#8208;PHI up to 10&#8208;5 S cm&#8208;1 at 42%RH). At the same time, the highest photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate is observed for Na&#8208;PHI, which is mirrored by increased photogenerated charge&#8208;carrier lifetimes, pointing to efficient charge&#8208;carrier stabilization by, e.g., mobile ions. These results indicate that also ionic conductivity is an important parameter that can influence the photocatalytic activity. Besides, RH&#8208;dependent ionic conductivity is of high interest for separators, membranes, or sensors.

         <title>Tin&#8208;Based Anode Materials for Stable Sodium Storage: Progress and Perspective</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) are now intensively studied to complement lithium&#8208;ion batteries in energy&#8208;storage markets. Recent advances in various high&#8208;capacity Sn&#8208;based anode materials for SIBs are summarized, with an emphasis on the reaction mechanisms, and the multiphase and multiscale structural optimizations for stable sodium storage. Cathode materials and electrolyte are also discussed from the perspective of full&#8208;cell construction.








Abstract
Because of concerns regarding shortages of lithium resources and the urgent need to develop low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;efficiency energy&#8208;storage systems, research and applications of sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) have re&#8208;emerged in recent years. Herein, recent advances in high&#8208;capacity Sn&#8208;based anode materials for stable SIBs are highlighted, including tin (Sn) alloys, Sn oxides, Sn sulfides, Sn selenides, Sn phosphides, and their composites. The reaction mechanisms between Sn&#8208;based materials and sodium are clarified. Multiphase and multiscale structural optimizations of Sn&#8208;based materials to achieve good sodium&#8208;storage performance are emphasized. Full&#8208;cell designs using Sn&#8208;based materials as anodes and further development of Sn&#8208;based materials are discussed from a commercialization perspective. Insights into the preparation of future high&#8208;performance Sn&#8208;based anode materials and the construction of sodium&#8208;ion full batteries with a high energy density and long service life are provided.

         <title>A ROS&#8208;Sensitive Nanozyme&#8208;Augmented Photoacoustic Nanoprobe for Early Diagnosis and Therapy of Acute Liver Failure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;sensitive nanozyme&#8208;augmented photoacoustic nanoprobe is developed for early diagnosis and therapy of acute liver failure (ALF). Deep&#8208;tissue detection of ROS in early ALF is achieved by the nanoprobe due to the synergy between nanocatalytic bubble generation and thermoelastic expansion. Meanwhile, nanozymes released from the nanoprobe can catalyze ROS into O2, allowing highly efficient therapy of ALF.








Abstract
Early diagnosis of acute liver failure (ALF) is critical for curable treatment of patients, because most existing ALF therapies have narrow therapeutic time windows after disease onset. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), which lead to the sequential occurrences of hepatocyte necrosis and the leakage of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), represent early biomarkers of ALF. Photoacoustic imaging is emerging as a powerful tool for in vivo imaging of ROS. However, high&#8208;performance imaging probes that can boost the photoacoustic signals of the short&#8208;lived ROS of ALF are yet to be developed, and there remains a great challenge for ROS&#8208;based imaging of ALF. Herein, a ROS&#8208;sensitive nanozyme&#8208;augmented photoacoustic nanoprobe for successful in vivo imaging of ALF is presented. The deep&#8208;penetrating photoacoustic signals of the nanoprobe can be activated by the overexpressed ROS in ALF due to the synergy between nanocatalytic bubbles generation and thermoelastic expansion. Impressively, the nanozyme&#8208;augmented ROS imaging enables earlier diagnosis of ALF than the clinical ALT method, and the ROS&#8208;activated catalytic activity of nanoprobe permits timely nanocatalytic therapy of ALF.

         <title>Dielectric&#8208;Modulated Biosensing with Ultrahigh&#8208;Frequency&#8208;Operated Graphene Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrolyte&#8208;gated graphene field&#8208;effect transistors (Gr&#8208;FETs) are configured in reflectometry mode at ultrahigh frequencies (UHF), where the conductivity of high&#8208;salt solutions, and thus the ionic screening is fully cancelled. By simultaneous characterization using field effect and UHF reflectometry, dielectric&#8208;modulated Gr&#8208;FET biosensors with high sensitivities are achieved.








Abstract
Owing to their excellent electrical properties and chemical stability, graphene field&#8208;effect transistors (Gr&#8208;FET) are extensively studied for biosensing applications. However, hinging on surface interactions of charged biomolecules, the sensitivity of Gr&#8208;FET is hampered by ionic screening under physiological conditions with high salt concentrations up to frequencies as high as MHz. Here, an electrolyte&#8208;gated Gr&#8208;FET in reflectometry mode at ultrahigh frequencies (UHF, around 2&#160;GHz), where the ionic screening is fully cancelled and the dielectric sensitivity of the device allows the Gr&#8208;FET to directly function in high&#8208;salt solutions, is configured. Strikingly, by simultaneous characterization using electrolyte gating and UHF reflectometry, the developed graphene biosensors offer unprecedented capability for real&#8208;time monitoring of dielectric&#8208;specified biomolecular/cell interactions/activities, with superior limit of detection compared to that of previously reported nanoscale high&#8208;frequency sensors. These achievements highlight the unique potential of ultrahigh&#8208;frequency operation for unblocking the true potential of graphene biosensors for point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnostic.

         <title>Honeycomb&#8208;Structure RuI3, A New Quantum Material Related to &#945;&#8208;RuCl3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Honeycomb&#8208;layer&#8208;structure RuI3 is synthesized at moderately high pressures. Preliminary characterization reveals metallic, paramagnetic behavior with no long&#8208;range magnetic order down to 0.35&#160;K, and an unusually large T&#8208;linear contribution to the heat capacity. This RuI3 phase with a layered honeycomb lattice and strong spin&#8211;orbit&#8208;coupling, may provide a new route for the characterization of quantum materials.








Abstract
The layered honeycomb lattice material &#945;&#8208;RuCl3 has emerged as a prime candidate for displaying the Kitaev quantum spin liquid state, and as such has attracted much research interest. Here a new layered honeycomb lattice polymorph of RuI3, a material that is strongly chemically and structurally related to &#945;&#8208;RuCl3 is described. The material is synthesized at moderately elevated pressures and is stable under ambient conditions. Preliminary characterization reveals that it is a metallic conductor, with the absence of long&#8208;range magnetic order down to 0.35 K and an unusually large T&#8208;linear contribution to the heat capacity. It is proposed that this phase, with a layered honeycomb lattice and strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling, provides a new route for the characterization of quantum materials.

         <dc:description>
The nanoparticle&#8208;based gene&#8208;delivery method is developed and advanced as the new gene&#8208;delivery system for plants, realizing transient/stable transformation, obtaining transgenic food, and resisting to plant abiotic/biotic stresses.








Abstract
Plant genetic engineering is essential for improving crop yield, quality, and resistance to abiotic/biotic stresses for sustainable agriculture. Agrobacterium&#8208;, biolistic bombardment&#8208;, electroporation&#8208;, and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)&#8208;mediated genetic&#8208;transformation systems are extensively used in plant genetic engineering. However, these systems have limitations, including species dependency, destruction of plant tissues, low transformation efficiency, and high cost. Recently, nanotechnology&#8208;based gene&#8208;delivery methods have been developed for plant genetic transformation. This nanostrategy shows excellent transformation efficiency, good biocompatibility, adequate protection of exogenous nucleic acids, and the potential for plant regeneration. However, the nanomaterial&#8208;mediated gene&#8208;delivery system in plants is still in its infancy, and there are many challenges for its broad applications. Herein, the conventional genetic transformation techniques used in plants are briefly discussed. After that, the progress in the development of nanomaterial&#8208;based gene&#8208;delivery systems is considered. CRISPR&#8208;Cas&#8208;mediated genome editing and its combined applications with plant nanotechnology are also discussed. The conceptual innovations, methods, and practical applications of nanomaterial&#8208;mediated genetic transformation summarized herein will be beneficial for promoting plant genetic engineering in modern agriculture.

         <title>Unraveling the Molar Mass Dependence of Shearing&#8208;Induced Aggregation Structure of a High&#8208;Mobility Polymer Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molar mass dependence on aggregation structure evolution and charge transport of TDPP&#8208;Se is thoroughly examined by neutron scattering and complementary techniques. The rod&#8208;like preaggregate with moderate length favors a highly aligned and ordered structure by bar coating. Hence, a reliable hole mobility up to &#8776;14 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 is recorded for thin&#8208;film transistors using diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;based polymers.








Abstract
Aggregation&#8208;structure formation of conjugated polymers is a fundamental problem in the field of organic electronics and remains poorly understood. Herein, the molar mass dependence of the aggregation structure of a high&#8208;mobility conjugated copolymer (TDPP&#8208;Se) comprising thiophene&#8208;flanked diketopyrrolopyrrole and selenophene is thoroughly shown. Five batches of TDPP&#8208;Se are prepared with the number&#8208;average molecular weights (Mn) varied greatly from 21 to 135&#160;kg mol&#8722;1. Small&#8208;angle neutron scattering and transmission electron microscopy are combined to probe the solution structure of these polymers, consistently using a deuterated solvent. All the polymers adopt 1D rod&#8208;like aggregation structures and the radius of the 1D rods is not sensitive to the Mn, while the length increases monotonically with Mn. By utilizing the ordered packing of the aggregated structure in solution, a highly aligned and ordered film is prepared and, thereafter, a reliable hole mobility of 13.8 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 is realized in organic thin&#8208;film transistors with the moderate Mn batch via bar coating. The hole mobility is among the highest values reported for diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;based polymers. This work paves the way to visualize the real aggregated structure of polymer semiconductors in solution and sheds light on the microstructure control of high&#8208;performance electronic devices.

Hence, a reliable hole mobility up to &#8776;14 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; is recorded for thin-film transistors using diketopyrrolopyrrole-based polymers.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aggregation-structure formation of conjugated polymers is a fundamental problem in the field of organic electronics and remains poorly understood. Herein, the molar mass dependence of the aggregation structure of a high-mobility conjugated copolymer (TDPP-Se) comprising thiophene-flanked diketopyrrolopyrrole and selenophene is thoroughly shown. Five batches of TDPP-Se are prepared with the number-average molecular weights (&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) varied greatly from 21 to 135&#160;kg mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Small-angle neutron scattering and transmission electron microscopy are combined to probe the solution structure of these polymers, consistently using a deuterated solvent. All the polymers adopt 1D rod-like aggregation structures and the radius of the 1D rods is not sensitive to the &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, while the length increases monotonically with &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;. By utilizing the ordered packing of the aggregated structure in solution, a highly aligned and ordered film is prepared and, thereafter, a reliable hole mobility of 13.8 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; is realized in organic thin-film transistors with the moderate &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; batch via bar coating. The hole mobility is among the highest values reported for diketopyrrolopyrrole-based polymers. This work paves the way to visualize the real aggregated structure of polymer semiconductors in solution and sheds light on the microstructure control of high-performance electronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>EG&#8208;like Brush Polymer Conjugate of RNA Aptamer that Shows Reversible Anticoagulant Activity and Minimal Immune Response</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Ribonucleic acid (RNA) therapeutics are an emerging class of drugs. RNA aptamers are of significant therapeutic and clinical interest because their activity can be easily reversed in vivo&#8212;a useful feature that is difficult to achieve using other therapeutic modalities. Despite their therapeutic promise, RNA aptamers are limited by their poor blood circulation. The attachment of polyethylene glycol (PEG) to RNA aptamers addresses this limitation. However, an RNA aptamer&#8208;PEG conjugate that is a reversible anticoagulant failed in a clinical trial due to the reactivity of the conjugate with pre&#8208;existing PEG antibodies, leading to anaphylactoid responses, and has cast a pall over PEGylation of aptamers and other biologics, despite its long history of utility in drug delivery. Here, we eliminated PEG antibody&#8208;reactivity of this RNA aptamer by conjugating it to a next generation PEG&#8208;like brush polymer&#8212;poly[(oligoethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate)] (POEGMA). The conjugate retained the drug's therapeutic action and the ability to be easily reversed. Importantly, this conjugate does not bind pre&#8208;existing PEG antibodies that are prevalent in humans as measured in vitro and does not induce a humoral immune response against the polymer itself in mice. These findings suggest a path to rescuing the PEGylation of RNA therapeutics and vaccines from the deleterious side&#8208;effects of PEG.

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Metal&#8208;Based Nanophotonic Structures for High&#8208;Performance SEIRA Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA) spectroscopy can provide label&#8208;free, non&#8208;destructive detection and identification of analytes with high sensitivity and specificity, and therefore has been widely used for various sensing applications. SEIRA sensors usually employ resonant nanophotonic structures, which can substantially enhance electric field and hence light&#8208;matter interactions by orders of magnitude in certain nanoscale hot spots of the devices. However, as ever smaller hot spots are employed to further enhance the field, the delivery of analytes into such hot spots becomes increasingly challenging. Here, we demonstrate high&#8208;performance nanophotonic SEIRA sensors based on nano&#8208;patch antennas with a liquid gallium ground plane, which not only lead to ultra&#8208;high field confinement and enhancement, but also allow for convenient and efficient delivery of analytes into nanometric hot spots by employing a simple procedure suitable for point&#8208;of&#8208;care applications. Our sensors exhibited superior sensitivity in the mid&#8208;infrared spectral region. Around 10% molecular vibrational signals (i.e., the modulation of a sensor's reflection spectrum owing to the molecular vibrational modes of the analytes) near 2900 cm&#8722;1 were achieved from sensing monolayer 1&#8208;octadecanethiol. Our cost&#8208;effective and reliable method for realizing liquid&#8208;metal&#8208;based nanophotonic structures provides a new strategy for developing high&#8208;performance sensors and other photonics applications in the infrared region.

         <title>Synergistic Disruption of Metabolic Homeostasis Through Hyperbranched Poly(ethylene glycol) Conjugates As Nanotherapeutics to Constrain Cancer Growth</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Combination therapy is a promising approach for effective treatment of tumors through synergistically regulating pathways. However, the synergistic effect is limited, likely by uncontrolled co&#8208;delivery of different therapeutic payloads in a single nanoparticle. Herein, we developed a combination nanotherapeutic by using two amphiphilic conjugates hyperbranched poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;pyropheophorbide&#8208;a (Ppa) (HP&#8208;P) and hyperbranched poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;doxorubicin (DOX) (HP&#8208;D) to construct co&#8208;assembly nanoparticles (HP&#8208;PD NPs) for controllably co&#8208;loading and co&#8208;delivering Ppa and DOX. In vitro and in vivo anti&#8208;tumor studies confirmed the synergistic effect of photodynamic therapy and chemotherapy from HP&#8208;PD NPs. Metabolic variations revealed that tumor suppression was associated with disruption of metabolic homeostasis, leading to reduced protein translation. Our study uncovers the manipulation of metabolic changes in tumor cells through disruption of cellular homeostasis using HP&#8208;PD NPs and provides a new insight into rational design of synergistic nanotherapeutics for combination therapy.

         <title>A Universal ternary&#8208;solvent&#8208;ink Strategy Towards Efficient inkjet&#8208;printed Perovskite Quantum Dot light&#8208;emitting Diodes</title>

Abstract
Towards next&#8208;generation electroluminescent quantum dot (QD) displays, inkjet printing technique has been convinced as one of the most promising low&#8208;cost and large&#8208;scale manufacturing of patterned quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs). The development of high&#8208;quality and stable QD inks is a key step to push this technology towards practical applications. Herein, a universal ternary&#8208;solvent&#8208;ink strategy is proposed for the cesium lead halides (CsPbX3) perovskite QDs and their corresponding inkjet&#8208;printed QLEDs. With this tailor&#8208;made ternary halogen&#8208;free solvent (naphthene, n&#8208;tridecane and n&#8208;nonane) recipe, a highly dispersive and stable CsPbX3 QD ink is obtained, which exhibits much better printability and film&#8208;forming ability than that of the binary solvent (naphthene and n&#8208;tridecane) system, leading to a much better qualitied perovskite QD thin film. Consequently, a record peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 8.54% and maximum luminance of 43883.39&#160;cd/m2 was achieved in inkjet&#8208;printed green perovskite QLEDs, which is much higher than that of the binary&#8208;solvent&#8208;system&#8208;based devices (EQE&#8764;2.26%). Moreover, the ternary&#8208;solvent&#8208;system exhibits a universal applicability in the inkjet&#8208;printed red and blue perovskite QLEDs as well as cadmium (Cd)&#8208;based QLEDs. This work demonstrates a new strategy for tailor&#8208;making a general ternary&#8208;solvent&#8208;QD&#8208;ink system for efficient inkjet&#8208;printed QLEDs as well as the other solution&#8208;processed electronic devices in the future.

         <title>Ultrahigh&#8208;flux Nanoporous Graphene Membrane for Sustainable Seawater Desalination Using Low&#8208;grade Heat</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Membrane distillation has attracted great attention in the development of sustainable desalination and zero&#8208;discharge processes because of its possibility to recover 100% water and the potential to integrate with low&#8208;grade heat such as solar energy. However, the conventional membrane structures and materials afford limited flux thus obstructing its practical application. Here we report ultrathin nanoporous graphene membranes by selectively forming thin graphene layers on the top edges of highly porous anodic alumina oxide support, which creates short and fast transport pathways for water vapor but not liquid. The process avoids the challenging pore&#8208;generation and substrate&#8208;transfer processes required to prepare regular graphene membranes. In the direct contact membrane distillation mode under a mild temperature pair of 65&#176;C&#160;/25&#176;C,&#160;the nanoporous graphene membranes show an average water flux of 421.7 Lm&#8722;2h&#8722;1 with over 99.8% salt rejection, which is an order of magnitude higher than any reported polymeric membranes. The mechanism for high water flux is revealed by detailed characterizations and theoretical modeling. Outdoor field tests using Red Sea water heated under direct sunlight radiation show that the membranes have an average water flux of 86.3 Lm&#8722;2h&#8722;1 from 8 am. to 8 pm., showing a great potential for real applications in seawater desalination.

&lt;p&gt;Membrane distillation has attracted great attention in the development of sustainable desalination and zero-discharge processes because of its possibility to recover 100% water and the potential to integrate with low-grade heat such as solar energy. However, the conventional membrane structures and materials afford limited flux thus obstructing its practical application. Here we report ultrathin nanoporous graphene membranes by selectively forming thin graphene layers on the top edges of highly porous anodic alumina oxide support, which creates short and fast transport pathways for water vapor but not liquid. The process avoids the challenging pore-generation and substrate-transfer processes required to prepare regular graphene membranes. In the direct contact membrane distillation mode under a mild temperature pair of 65&#176;C&#160;/25&#176;C,&#160;the nanoporous graphene membranes show an average water flux of 421.7 Lm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with over 99.8% salt rejection, which is an order of magnitude higher than any reported polymeric membranes. The mechanism for high water flux is revealed by detailed characterizations and theoretical modeling. Outdoor field tests using Red Sea water heated under direct sunlight radiation show that the membranes have an average water flux of 86.3 Lm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; from 8 am. to 8 pm., showing a great potential for real applications in seawater desalination.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>14&#160;GHz Schottky Diodes using a p&#8208;Doped Organic Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The low carrier mobility of organic semiconductors and the high parasitic resistance and capacitance often encountered in conventional organic Schottky diodes, hinder their deployment in emerging radio frequency (RF) electronics. Here we overcome these limitations by combining self&#8208;aligned asymmetric nanogap electrodes (&#8764;25&#160;nm) produced by adhesion&#8208;lithography, with a high mobility organic semiconductor and demonstrate RF Schottky diodes able to operate in the 5G frequency spectrum. We used C16IDT&#8208;BT, as the high hole mobility polymer, and studied the impact of p&#8208;doping on the diode performance. Pristine C16IDT&#8208;BT&#8208;based diodes exhibit maximum intrinsic and extrinsic cutoff frequencies (fC) of &gt;100&#160;and 6&#160;GHz, respectively. This extraordinary performance is attributed primarily to the planar nature of the nanogap channel and the diode's small junction capacitance (&lt; 2&#160;pF). Doping of C16IDT&#8208;BT with the molecular p&#8208;dopant C60F48, improves the diode's performance further by reducing the series resistance resulting to intrinsic and extrinsic fC of &gt;100&#160;and &#8764;14&#160;GHz respectively, while the DC output voltage of a RF rectifier circuit increases by a tenfold. Our work highlights the importance of the planar nanogap architecture and paves the way for the use of organic Schottky diodes in large&#8208;area radio frequency electronics of the future.

         <title>Fabrication of Stretchable Superamphiphobic Surfaces with Deformation&#8208;Induced Rearrangeable Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Stretchable superamphiphobic surfaces with a high deformation resistance are in demand to achieve liquid&#8208;repellent performance in flexible electronics, artificial skin and textile dressings. However, it is challenging to make mechanically robust superamphiphobic coatings, which maintain their super&#8208;liquid repellency in a highly stretched state. Here, we report a stretchable superamphiphobic surface on which the microstructures can rearrange during stretching to maintain a stable superamphiphobicity even in a high tensile strain. The surface is prepared by spray&#8208;coating silicone nanofilaments onto a pre&#8208;stretched substrate (e.g., cis&#8208;1,4&#8208;polyisoprene) with a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) layer as a binder. After subsequent fluorination, this surface keeps its superamphiphobicity to both water and n&#8208;hexadecane up to the tensile strain of at least 225%. The binding PDMS layer and rearrangeable structures maximize the deformation resistance of the surface during the stretching process. Superamphiphobicity and morphology of the surface are maintained even after 1000 stretch&#8208;release cycles. Taking advantage of the mentioned benefits, a liquid manipulation system was designed. It has the potential for fabricating reusable and low&#8208;cost platforms for biochemical detections and lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip systems.

         <title>A New Strategy for Microbial Taxonomic Identification through Micro&#8208;Biosynthetic Gold Nanoparticles and Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Microorganisms can serve as biological factories for the synthesis of inorganic nanomaterials. Under mild and environmentally friendly conditions, microorganisms can reduce inorganic ions to produce diverse nanoparticles that can become useful as nanocatalysts, energy harvesting&#8208;storage components, antibacterial agents, and biomedical materials. Herein, we develop the biosynthesis of inorganic nanomaterials into a simple, stable and accurate strategy for distinguishing microorganisms with classification hierarchy. This strategy can identify microorganisms from multiple classification levels (i.e., kingdom, order, genus and species) without gene amplification, biochemical testing, or target recognition. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) biosynthesized by different microorganisms differ in color of the solution, and their features can be characterized including the particle size, the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectra, and the surface potential. We exploit the interrelation between the features of micro&#8208;biosynthetic AuNPs and the classification of microorganisms at different levels through machine learning to establish a taxonomic model. This model well agrees with traditional classification methods that offers a new strategy for microbial taxonomic identification. The underlying mechanism of this strategy relates to the biomolecules produced by different microorganisms including glucose, glutathione, and NADPH&#8208;dependent reductase that regulate the features of micro&#8208;biosynthetic AuNPs. This work broadens the application of biosynthesis of inorganic materials through micro&#8208;biosynthetic AuNPs and machine learning, which holds great promise as a tool for biomedical research.

         <title>Nonvolatile ferroelectric domain wall memory embedded in complex topological domain structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The discovery and precise manipulation of atomic&#8208;size conductive ferroelectric domain walls offers new opportunities for a wide range of prospective electronic devices, and the emerging field of walltronics. Herein, we demonstrate a highly stable and fatigue&#8208;resistant nonvolatile memory device based on deterministic creation and erasure of conductive domain walls that are geometrically confined in a topological domain structure. By introducing a pair of delicately designed coaxial electrodes onto the epitaxial BiFeO3 film, one can easily create a centre&#8208;type quadrant topological domain with conductive charged domain walls. More importantly, reversible switching of the quadrant domain between the convergent state with highly conductive confined walls and the divergent state with insulating confined walls can be realised, resulting in an apparent resistance change with a large on/off ratio of &gt;&#160;104 and a technically preferred readout current (up to 40 nA). Owing to restrictions from the clamped quadrant ferroelastic domain, the device exhibited excellent restoration repeatability over 108 cycles and a long retention of over 12 days (&gt; 106&#160;s). These results provide a new pathway toward high&#8208;performance ferroelectric domain wall memory, which might spur extensive interest in exploring the immense potential in the emerging field of walltronics.

         <title>High&#8208;performance Memristors based on Ultrathin Two&#8208;dimensional Copper Chalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Copper chalcogenides represent a class of materials with unique crystal structures, high electrical conductivity and earth abundance, and has been recognized as promising candidates for next&#8208;generation green electronics. However, their two&#8208;dimensional (2D) structures and the corresponding electronic properties have rarely been touched. Herein, we have successfully synthesized a series of ultrathin copper chalcogenide nanosheets with thicknesses down to two unit cells, including layered Cu2Te, as well as nonlayered CuSe and Cu9S5, via van der Waals epitaxy, and investigated their nonvolatile memristive behavior for the first time. Benefiting from the highly active Cu ions with low migration barriers, the memristors based on ultrathin 2D copper chalcogenide crystals exhibit relatively small switching voltage (&#8764;0.4&#160;V), fast switching speed, high switching uniformity and wide operating temperature range (from 80 K to 420 K), as well as stable retention and good cyclic endurance. These results demonstrate their tangible applications in future low&#8208;power, cryogenic and high temperature harsh electronics.

         <title>Synthetic Matrix Scaffolds Engineer the in Vivo Tumor Immune Microenvironment for Immunotherapy Screening</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Immunotherapy has emerged as one of the most powerful anti&#8208;cancer therapy classes but is stymied by the limits of existing preclinical models with respect to disease latency and reproducibility. In addition, the influence of differing immune microenvironments within tumors observed clinically and associated with immunotherapeutic resistance cannot be tuned to facilitate drug testing workflows without changing model system or laborious genetic approaches. To address this testing platform gap in the immune oncology drug development pipeline, we deployed engineered biomaterials as a scaffold to increase tumor formation rate, decrease disease latency, and diminish variability of immune infiltrates into tumors formed from murine mammary carcinoma cell lines implanted into syngeneic mice. By altering synthetic gel formulations that reshaped infiltrating immune cells within the tumor, responsiveness of the same tumor model to varying classes of cancer immunotherapies, including in situ vaccination with a molecular adjuvant and immune checkpoint blockade, diverged. These results demonstrate the significant role the local immune microenvironment plays in immunotherapeutic response. These engineered tumor immune microenvironments therefore improve upon the limitations of current breast tumor models used for immune oncology drug screening to enable immunotherapeutic testing relevant to the variability in tumor immune microenvironments underlying immunotherapeutic resistance seen in human patients.

         <title>Harnessing the Quantum Behavior of Spins on Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The desire to control and measure individual quantum systems such as atoms and ions in a vacuum has led to significant scientific and engineering developments in the past decades that form the basis of today's quantum information science. Single atoms and molecules on surfaces, on the other hand, are heavily investigated by physicists, chemists, and material scientists in search of novel electronic and magnetic functionalities. These two paths crossed in 2015 when it was&#160;first clearly demonstrated that individual spins on a surface can be coherently controlled and read out in an all&#8208;electrical fashion. The enabling technique is a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and electron spin resonance (ESR), which offers unprecedented coherent controllability at the Angstrom length scale. This review aims to illustrate the essential ingredients that allow the quantum operations of single spins on surfaces. Three domains of applications of surface spins, namely quantum sensing, quantum control, and quantum simulation, are discussed with physical principles explained and examples presented. Enabled by the atomically&#8208;precise fabrication capability of STM, single spins on surfaces might one day lead to the realization of quantum nanodevices and artificial quantum materials at the atomic&#160;scale.

         <title>Electrolyte Modulators toward Polarization&#8208;Mitigated Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries for Sustainable Electric Transportation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D metal&#8211;organic framework is employed as an electrolyte modulator (MEM) for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIB). Such an MEM can afford electrolytes with high lithium&#8208;ion transference number and high ionic conductivity, as well as low&#8208;resistivity interface with electrodes and ability to suppress polarizations. The LIB operated under strenuous conditions demonstrates that the MEM dramatically improves the energy output, energy efficiency, and cycle lifespan.








Abstract
Electric vehicles (EVs) are being adopted to replace combustion engine vehicles to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate change; developing batteries with high energy efficiency and long lifespan, in the context of carbon footprint and cost, are essential to ensure the successful transition. Herein, an electrolyte modulator that can effectively mitigate the polarization of lithium&#8208;ion batteries, leading to dramatically improved energy efficiency and lifespan, is reported. Under a dynamic stress test that mimics the operations of EVs, commercial pouch cells with a low concentration of electrolyte modulator (0.2 wt% of the electrolyte) exhibit enhanced energy efficiency (87.5% vs 80.4% for the first 500 testing cycles) and prolonged lifespan (fourfold improvement based on 70% energy&#8208;output retention). This work provides a simple yet effective strategy toward sustainable electrification of vehicles.

         <title>Acoustophoretic Liquefaction for 3D Printing Ultrahigh&#8208;Viscosity Nanoparticle Suspensions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acoustophoretic&#8208;liquefaction Digital Light Processing (AL&#8208;DLP) permits manipulation of resin rheology during 3D printing. Acoustic transduction reduces the viscosity of nanopartice suspensions by up to three orders of magnitude to promote resin recirculation and reduce viscous adhesion. Consequently, AL&#8208;DLP improves resolution (&gt;25%), increases printable area (&#8776;50 &#215; ), and reduces build times (&gt;3 &#215; faster) when compared to conventional methods for printing composite.








Abstract
An acoustic liquefaction approach to enhance the flow of yield stress fluids during Digital Light Processing (DLP)&#8208;based 3D printing is reported. This enhanced flow enables processing of ultrahigh&#8208;viscosity resins (&#956;app&#160;&gt; 3700 Pa s at shear rates &#947;&#729;&#160;= 0.01 s&#8211;1) based on silica particles in a silicone photopolymer. Numerical simulations of the acousto&#8211;mechanical coupling in the DLP resin feed system at different agitation frequencies predict local resin flow velocities exceeding 100 mm s&#8211;1 at acoustic transduction frequencies of 110 s&#8211;1. Under these conditions, highly loaded particle suspensions (weight fractions, &#981;&#160;= 0.23) can be printed successfully in complex geometries. Such mechanically reinforced composites possess a tensile toughness 2000% greater than the neat photopolymer. Beyond an increase in processible viscosities, acoustophoretic liquefaction DLP (AL&#8208;DLP) creates a transient reduction in apparent viscosity that promotes resin recirculation and decreases viscous adhesion. As a result, acoustophoretic liquefaction Digital Light Processing (AL&#8208;DLP) improves the printed feature resolution by more than 25%, increases printable object sizes by over 50 times, and can build parts &gt;3 &#215; faster when compared to conventional methodologies.

         <title>Achieving Efficient NIR&#8208;II Type&#8208;I Photosensitizers for Photodynamic/Photothermal Therapy upon Regulating Chalcogen Elements</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window semiconducting polymers (SPs) for type&#8208;I photodynamic therapy (PDT) through generating O2&#8226;&#8722; for hypoxic oncotherapy have not previously been reported. Upon tuning of chalcogen elements, the first type&#8208;I PDT NIR&#8208;II SPs are achieved due to narrowed &#916;EST and enlarged spin&#8211;orbit coupling constant. The suitable lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy and &#916;G&#160;&lt;&#160;0 provides ideas for designing type&#8208;I photosensitizers.








Abstract
Second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window type&#8208;I photosensitizers have intrinsic advantages in photodynamic/photothermal therapy (PDT/PTT) of some malignant tumors with deep infiltration, large size, complicated location, and low possibility of surgery/radiotherapy. Herein, three chalcogen&#8208;element&#8208;based donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;type semiconducting polymers (poly[2,2&#8243;&#8208;((E)&#8208;4,4&#8243;&#8208;bis(2&#8208;octyldodecyl)&#8208;[6,6&#8243;&#8208;bithieno[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrolylidene]&#8208;5,5&#8243;(4H,4&#8243;H)&#8208;dione)&#8208;alt&#8208;2,5&#8208;(thiophene)] (PTS), poly[2,2&#8243;&#8208;((E)&#8208;4,4&#8243;&#8208;bis(2&#8208;octyldodecyl)&#8208;[6,6&#8243;&#8208;bithieno[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrolylidene]&#8208;5,5&#8243;(4H,4&#8243;H)&#8208;dione)&#8208;alt&#8208;2,5&#8208;(selenophene)] (PTSe), and poly[2,2&#8243;&#8208;((E)&#8208;4,4&#8243;&#8208;bis(2&#8208;octyldodecyl)&#8208;[6,6&#8243;&#8208;bithieno[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrolylidene]&#8208;5,5&#8243;(4H,4&#8242;H)&#8208;dione)&#8208;alt&#8208;2,5&#8208;(tellurophene)] (PTTe)) are synthesized and fully characterized, demonstrating strong absorption in the NIR&#8208;II region. Upon adjusting the chalcogen elements, the intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer characteristics and the heavy&#8208;atom effect are tuned to enhance the intersystem crossing rate, improving the photodynamic effect. Moreover, the energy levels and Gibbs free energies are tuned to facilitate the type&#8208;I photodynamic process. As a result, PTTe nanoparticles (NPs) produce superoxide anion radicals (O2&#8226;&#8722;) more efficiently and demonstrate higher photothermal conversion efficiency than PTS and PTSe NPs upon NIR&#8208;II (1064&#160;nm) laser irradiation, exhibiting unprecedented NIR&#8208;II type&#8208;I PDT/PTT performance in vitro and in vivo. This work provides ideas for achieving high&#8208;performance NIR&#8208;II type&#8208;I PDT/PTT semiconducting polymers for hypoxic oncotherapy.

&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt; and enlarged spin&#8211;orbit coupling constant. The suitable lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy and &#916;&lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;&#160;&amp;lt;&#160;0 provides ideas for designing type-I photosensitizers.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second near-infrared (NIR-II) window type-I photosensitizers have intrinsic advantages in photodynamic/photothermal therapy (PDT/PTT) of some malignant tumors with deep infiltration, large size, complicated location, and low possibility of surgery/radiotherapy. Herein, three chalcogen-element-based donor&#8211;acceptor-type semiconducting polymers (poly[2,2&#8243;-((&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-4,4&#8243;-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-[6,6&#8243;-bithieno[3,2-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;]pyrrolylidene]-5,5&#8243;(4&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;,4&#8243;&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;)-dione)-&lt;i&gt;alt&lt;/i&gt;-2,5-(thiophene)] (PTS), poly[2,2&#8243;-((&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-4,4&#8243;-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-[6,6&#8243;-bithieno[3,2-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;]pyrrolylidene]-5,5&#8243;(4&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;,4&#8243;&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;)-dione)-&lt;i&gt;alt&lt;/i&gt;-2,5-(selenophene)] (PTSe), and poly[2,2&#8243;-((&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-4,4&#8243;-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-[6,6&#8243;-bithieno[3,2-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;]pyrrolylidene]-5,5&#8243;(4&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;,4&#8242;&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;)-dione)-&lt;i&gt;alt&lt;/i&gt;-2,5-(tellurophene)] (PTTe)) are synthesized and fully characterized, demonstrating strong absorption in the NIR-II region. Upon adjusting the chalcogen elements, the intramolecular charge-transfer characteristics and the heavy-atom effect are tuned to enhance the intersystem crossing rate, improving the photodynamic effect. Moreover, the energy levels and Gibbs free energies are tuned to facilitate the type-I photodynamic process. As a result, PTTe nanoparticles (NPs) produce superoxide anion radicals (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8226;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) more efficiently and demonstrate higher photothermal conversion efficiency than PTS and PTSe NPs upon NIR-II (1064&#160;nm) laser irradiation, exhibiting unprecedented NIR-II type-I PDT/PTT performance in vitro and in vivo. This work provides ideas for achieving high-performance NIR-II type-I PDT/PTT semiconducting polymers for hypoxic oncotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Charge&#8208;Carrier Transport in Quasi&#8208;2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematic understanding of 2D perovskite's carrier transport mechanism is critical for the development of high&#8208;performance 2D perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The recent advances on the carrier behavior of 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper PSCs from the view of crystal structure, grain orientation, quantum&#8208;well width distribution, and device structure are summarized, and guidelines for successfully elevating carrier transports are provided.








Abstract
In recent years, 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (2DRP) perovskite materials have been explored as emerging semiconductor materials in solar cells owing to their excellent stability and structural diversity. Although 2DRP perovskites have achieved photovoltaic efficiencies exceeding 19%, their widespread use is hindered by their inferior charge&#8208;carrier transport properties in the presence of diverse organic spacer cations, compared to that of traditional 3D perovskites. Hence, a systematic understanding of the carrier transport mechanism in 2D perovskites is critical for the development of high&#8208;performance 2D perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, the recent advances in the carrier behavior of 2DRP PSCs are summarized, and guidelines for successfully enhancing carrier transport are provided. First, the composition and crystal structure of 2DRP perovskite materials that affect carrier transport are discussed. Then, the features of 2DRP perovskite films (phase separation, grain orientation, crystallinity kinetics, etc.), which are closely related to carrier transport, are evaluated. Next, the principal direction of carrier transport guiding the selection of the transport layer is revealed. Finally, an outlook is proposed and strategies for enhancing carrier transport in high&#8208;performance PSCs are rationalized.

         <title>Preconstructing Asymmetric Interface in Air Cathodes for High&#8208;Performance Rechargeable Zn&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries afford great potential towards next&#8208;generation sustainable energy storage. Nevertheless, the oxygen redox reactions at the air cathode are highly sluggish in kinetics to induce poor energy efficiency and limited cycling lifespan especially under high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity and high&#8208;current&#8208;density conditions. Air cathodes with asymmetric configurations significantly promote the electrocatalytic efficiency of the loaded electrocatalysts, whereas rational synthetic methodology to effectively fabricate asymmetric air cathodes remains insufficient. Herein, a strategy of asymmetric interface preconstruction is proposed to fabricate asymmetric air cathodes for high&#8208;performance rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries. Concretely, the asymmetric interface is preconstructed by introducing immiscible organic&#8211;water di&#8208;phases within the air cathode, at which the electrocatalysts are in&#8208;situ formed to achieve the asymmetric configuration. The as&#8208;fabricated asymmetric air cathodes demonstrate excellent performances regarding high working rates of 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, long cycling stability of 3400 cycles at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, and over 100 cycles under harsh conditions of 25&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 25 mAh cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the asymmetric interface preconstruction strategy is universal to many electrocatalytic systems and can be easily scaled up. This work provides an effective strategy towards advanced asymmetric air cathodes with high electrocatalytic efficiency and significantly promotes the performance of rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries for vast applications.

         <title>Smart Adhesive via Magnetic Actuation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Smart adhesives possess a wide range of applications owing to their reversibly and repeatedly switchable adhesion in transfer technology. Despite recent advances, it still remains a technical and scientific challenge to achieve strategies for rapidly tunable adhesion in a non&#8208;contact manner. In this study, a smart adhesive to achieve dynamically tunable adhesion is developed. Specifically, a mushroom&#8208;shaped adhesive with a magnetized tip is actuated to reversibly and rapidly transform the morphology via magnetic actuation. The smart adhesive has two working modes, namely selective pickup mode and pick&#8208;and&#8208;place mode. In the selective pickup mode, the external magnetic field is applied and the tip undergoes bending deformation. Changes in tip morphology allow for a reversible switch of the adhesion between &#8220;turn on&#8221; and &#8220;turn off&#8221;. In the pick&#8208;and&#8208;place mode, the external magnetic field is applied when the target object needs to be released. Upward bending deformation of the micro&#8208;beam, a part of the tip, creates an initial crack at the edge of the adhesion interface. The propagation of edge crack modulates the adhesion from strong to weak and the target object is instantly released. The proposed smart adhesive may be of interest for practical applications demanding high&#8208;precise and swiftly controlled movements.

         <title>Interlayer Excitons in Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Semiconductors for 2D Optoelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interlayer excitons in 2D transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenide heterostructures have attracted great attention recently, and are creating their identities and impacts. A brief overview of the enticing properties of interlayer excitons in strong quantum confinement, broadband and tunable spectrum, ultrafast dynamics, and electrical manipulation is given, illustrating the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art developments and their grand potential in ultralow&#8208;threshold lasing emission, broadband photodetection, valleytronics, and future excitonic transistors.








Abstract
Optoelectronic materials that allow on&#8208;chip integrated light signal emitting, routing, modulation, and detection are crucial for the development of high&#8208;speed and high&#8208;throughput optical communication and computing technologies. Interlayer excitons in 2D van der Waals heterostructures, where electrons and holes are bounded by Coulomb interaction but spatially localized in different 2D layers, have recently attracted intense attention for their enticing properties and huge potential in device applications. Here, a general view of these 2D&#8208;confined hydrogen&#8208;like bosonic particles and the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art developments with respect to the frontier concepts and prototypes is presented. Staggered type&#8208;II band alignment enables expansion of the interlayer direct bandgap from the intrinsic visible in monolayers up to the near&#8208; or even mid&#8208;infrared spectrum. Owing to large exciton binding energy, together with ultralong lifetime, room&#8208;temperature exciton devices and observation of quantum behaviors are demonstrated. With the rapid advances, it can be anticipated that future studies of interlayer excitons will not only allow the construction of all&#8208;exciton information processing circuits but will also continue to enrich the panoply of ideas on quantum phenomena.

         <title>Electronic Properties and Carrier Dynamics at the Alloy Interfaces of WS2xSe2&#8208;2x Spiral Nanosheets</title>

Abstract
Electronic properties at the interfaces between different&#8208;composition domains of two&#8208;dimensional (2D&#8208;) alloys are key for their optical, electronic, and optoelectronic applications. Understanding the interfacial electronic structures and carrier dynamics is essential for designing and fabricating devices that use these alloys. Here, WS2xSe2&#8208;2x spiral nanosheets were prepared using the physical vapor deposition method, and the nonlinear optical and electronic properties, as well as the carrier dynamics at the interfaces between the WS and WSe domains were studied. Second&#8208;harmonic generation tests demonstrated that these nanosheets exhibit a very strong layer&#8208;dependent nonlinear optical effect. Atomic&#8208;resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) measurements revealed that S and Se atoms are non&#8208;uniformly distributed, forming the WS domains, WSe domains, and defect&#8208;related areas. Atomic STM images and STS maps revealed enhanced local density of states by electron scattering at the WS/WSe interfaces, providing a detailed nanoscale interpretation of the S/Se ratio&#8208;dependent lifetimes observed in pump&#8208;probe spectroscopy measurements. This work provides valuable interfacial characterization of 2D&#8208; alloy materials, using state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods with high temporal and spatial resolutions. The obtained insights are likely to be useful for prospective applications.

         <title>High Photocatalytic Oxygen Evolution via Strong Built&#8208;in Electric Field induced by High Crystallinity of Perylene Imide Supramolecule</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
A highly crystalline perylene imide supramolecular photocatalyst (PDI&#8208;NH) is synthesized via imidazole solvent method. The catalyst shows a breakthrough oxygen evolution rate (40.6 mmolg&#8211;1h&#8211;1) with apparent quantum yield of 10.4% at 400&#160;nm, which is 1353 times higher than the low crystalline PDI&#8208;NH. The highly crystalline structure comes from the ordered self&#8208;assembly process in molten imidazole solvent via &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and hydrogen bonding. Further, the excellent performance ascribes to the robust built&#8208;in electric field induced by its high crystallinity, which greatly accelerates the charge separation and transfer. What's more, the PDI&#8208;NH is quite stable and can be reused over 50 hours without performance attenuation. Briefly, the crystalline PDI&#8208;NH with strong built&#8208;in electric field throws light on photocatalytic oxygen evolution, showing a new perspective for the design of organic photocatalysts.

         <title>Light&#8208;Triggered Efficient Sequential Drug Delivery of Biomimetic Nanosystem for Multimodal Chemo&#8208;, Antiangiogenic, and Anti&#8208;MDSC Therapy in Melanoma</title>

Abstract
In view of the multiple pathological hallmarks of tumors, nanosystems for the sequential delivery of various drugs whose targets are separately located inside and outside tumor cells are desired for improved cancer therapy. However, current sequential delivery is mainly achieved through enzyme&#8208; or acid&#8208;dependent degradation of the nanocarrier, which would be influenced by the heterogeneous tumor microenvironment, and unloading efficiency of the drug acting on the target outside tumor cells is usually unsatisfactory. Here, we developed a light&#8208;triggered sequential delivery strategy based on a liposomal formulation of doxorubicin (DOX)&#8208;loaded small&#8208;sized polymeric nanoparticles (DOX&#8208;NP) and free sunitinib in the aqueous cavity. The liposomal membrane was doped with photosensitizer porphyrin&#8208;phospholipid (PoP) and hybridized with red blood cell membrane to confer biomimetic features. Near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;induced membrane permeabilization triggered the &#8220;ultrafast&#8221; and &#8220;thorough&#8221; release of sunitinib (100% release in 5&#160;min) for antiangiogenic therapy and also MDSC inhibition to reverse the immunosuppressive tumor environment. Subsequently, the small&#8208;sized DOX&#8208;NP liberated from the liposomes was more easily uptaken by tumor cells for improved immunogenic chemotherapy. RNA sequencing and immune&#8208;related assay indicated therapeutic immune enhancement. This light&#8208;triggered sequential delivery strategy demonstrates the potency in cancer multimodal therapy against multiple targets in different spatial positions in tumor microenvironment.

         <title>Graphene on Chromia: A System for Beyond&#8208;Room&#8208;Temperature Spintronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
We provide evidence of robust spin&#8208;dependent transport in monolayer graphene, deposited on the (0001) surface of the antiferromagnetic (AFM)/magneto&#8208;electric oxide chromia (Cr2O3). Measurements performed in the non&#8208;local spin&#8208;Hall geometry reveal a robust signal that is present at zero external magnetic field, and which is significantly larger than any possible ohmic contribution. The spin&#8208;related signal persists well beyond the Neel temperature (&#8764;307 K) that defines the transition between the AFM and paramagnetic states, remaining visible at the highest studied temperature of close to 450 K. This robust character is consistent with prior theoretical studies of the graphene/Cr2O3 system, predicting that the lifting of sub&#8208;lattice symmetry in the graphene should induce an effective spin&#8208;orbit term of &#8764;40 meV. Overall, our results indicate that graphene&#8208;on&#8208;chromia heterostructures are a highly promising framework for the implementation of spintronic devices, capable of operation well&#8208;beyond room temperature.

         <title>Simultaneous Large Optical and Piezoelectric Effects Induced by Domain Reconfiguration Related to Ferroelectric Phase Transitions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In domain&#8208;engineered relaxor ferroelectric crystals of Pb(In1/2Nb1/2)O3&#8211;Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3&#8211;PbTiO3, reversible and repeatable phase transitions from the as&#8208;poled polydomain rhombohedral state to a monodomain monoclinic state can be stimulated by electric field or stress. These transitions lead to bimodal functionality&#8212;variable optical transparency as well as a giant effective piezoelectric effect.








Abstract
Electrical switching of ferroelectric domains and subsequent domain wall motion promotes strong piezoelectric activity, however, light scatters at refractive index discontinuities such as those found at domain wall boundaries. Thus, simultaneously achieving large piezoelectric effect and high optical transmissivity is generally deemed infeasible. Here, it is demonstrated that the ferroelectric domains in perovskite Pb(In1/2Nb1/2)O3&#8211;Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3&#8211;PbTiO3 domain&#8208;engineered crystals can be manipulated by electrical field and mechanical stress to reversibly and repeatably, with small hysteresis, transform the opaque polydomain structure into a highly transparent monodomain state. This control of optical properties can be achieved at very low electric fields (less than 1.5&#160;kV cm&#8722;1) and is accompanied by a large (&gt;10&#160;000 pm V&#8722;1) piezoelectric coefficient that is superior to linear state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art materials by a factor of three or more. The coexistence of tunable optical transmissivity and high piezoelectricity paves the way for a new class of photonic devices.

         <title>Material Evolution with Nanotechnology, Nanoarchitectonics, and Materials Informatics: What will be the Next Paradigm Shift in Nanoporous Materials?</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of functional materials has several complicated aspects. To accelerate material discovery, three key concepts, nanotechnology as a game changer, nanoarchitectonics as an integrator, and materials informatics as a super&#8208;accelerator, are discussed, starting from conceptual viewpoints and summing up with exemplifying recent developments, as the best integrated strategy for the development of functional materials, with a particular emphasis on nanoporous materials.








Abstract
Materials science and chemistry have played a central and significant role in advancing society. With the shift toward sustainable living, it is anticipated that the development of functional materials will continue to be vital for sustaining life on our&#160;planet. In the recent decades, rapid progress has been made in materials science and chemistry owing to the advances in experimental, analytical, and computational methods, thereby producing several novel and useful materials. However, most problems in material development are highly complex. Here, the best strategy for the development of functional materials via the implementation of three key concepts is discussed: nanotechnology as a game changer, nanoarchitectonics as an integrator, and materials informatics as a super&#8208;accelerator. Discussions from conceptual viewpoints and example recent developments, chiefly focused on nanoporous materials, are presented. It is anticipated that coupling these three strategies together will open advanced routes for the swift design and exploratory search of functional materials truly useful for solving real&#8208;world problems. These novel strategies will result in the evolution of nanoporous functional materials.

         <title>Generation and Control of Terahertz Spin Currents in Topology&#8208;Induced 2D Ferromagnetic Fe3GeTe2|Bi2Te3 Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Room&#8208;temperature 2D ferromagnetism is successfully realized in topological&#8208;insulator&#8208;induced van der Waals Fe3GeTe2, which is evidenced by ultrafast THz emission spectroscopy. Furthermore, the direction of the external magnetic field is rotated and the sample's front surface is reversed to probe the THz radiation symmetry. The results reveal that the spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion effect is the dominant THz radiation mechanism.








Abstract
Future information technologies for low&#8208;dissipation quantum computation, high&#8208;speed storage, and on&#8208;chip communication applications require the development of atomically thin, ultracompact, and ultrafast spintronic devices in which information is encoded, stored, and processed using electron spin. Exploring low&#8208;dimensional magnetic materials, designing novel heterostructures, and generating and controlling ultrafast electron spin in 2D magnetism at room temperature, preferably in the unprecedented terahertz (THz) regime, is in high demand. Using THz emission spectroscopy driven by femtosecond laser pulses, optical THz spin&#8208;current bursts at room temperature in the 2D van der Waals ferromagnetic Fe3GeTe2 (FGT) integrated with Bi2Te3 as a topological insulator are successfully realized. The symmetry of the THz radiation is effectively controlled by the optical pumping incidence and external magnetic field directions, indicating that the THz generation mechanism is the inverse Edelstein effect contributed spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion. Thickness&#8208;, temperature&#8208;, and structure&#8208;dependent nontrivial THz transients reveal that topology&#8208;enhanced interlayer exchange coupling increases the FGT Curie temperature to room temperature, which provides an effective approach for engineering THz spin&#8208;current pulses. These results contribute to the goal of all&#8208;optical generation, manipulation, and detection of ultrafast THz spin currents in room&#8208;temperature 2D magnetism, accelerating the development of atomically thin high&#8208;speed spintronic devices.

         <title>A High&#8208;Lift Micro&#8208;Aerial&#8208;Robot Powered by Low&#8208;Voltage and Long&#8208;Endurance Dielectric Elastomer Actuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;voltage, long&#8208;endurance, and power&#8208;dense dielectric elastomer actuator (DEA) based on novel multiple&#8208;layer fabrication methods and electrode&#8208;material optimization is presented. An insect&#8208;scale micro&#8208;aerial&#8208;vehicle (MAV) is designed with this DEA. The robot achieves the best&#8208;performing and longest hovering flight among sub&#8208;gram MAVs. This type of DEA shows promise in making next&#8208;generation agile soft robots.








Abstract
Dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) are a special class of artificial muscles that have been used to construct animal&#8208;like soft robotic systems. However, compared with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art rigid actuators such as piezoelectric bimorphs and electromagnetic motors, most DEAs require higher driving voltages, and their power density and lifetime remain substantially lower. These limitations pose significant challenges for developing agile and powered autonomous soft robots. Here, a low&#8208;voltage, high&#8208;endurance, and power&#8208;dense DEA based on novel multiple&#8208;layering techniques and electrode&#8208;material optimization, is reported. When operated at 400&#160;Hz, the 143&#160;mg DEA generates forces of 0.36 N and displacements of 1.15&#160;mm. This DEA is incorporated into an aerial robot to demonstrate high performance. The robot achieves a high lift&#8208;to&#8208;weight ratio of 3.7, a low hovering voltage of 500&#160;V, and a long lifetime that exceeds 2 million actuation cycles. With 20 s of hovering time, and position and attitude error smaller than 2.5&#160;cm and 2&#176;, respectively, the robot demonstrates the longest and best&#8208;performing flight among existing sub&#8208;gram aerial robots. This important milestone demonstrates that soft robots can outperform their state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art rigid counterparts, and it provides an important step toward realizing power autonomy in soft robotic flights.

         <title>A Minimalist Binary Vaccine Carrier for Personalized Postoperative Cancer Vaccine Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
In recent years, significant evolutions have been made in applying nanotechnologies for prophylactic and therapeutic cancer vaccine design. However, the clinical translation of nanovaccines is still limited owing to their complicated compositions and difficulties in the spatiotemporal coordination of antigen&#8208;presenting cell (APC) activation and antigen cross&#8208;presentation. Herein, we designed a minimalist binary nanovaccine (BiVax) that integrates innate stimulating activity into the carrier to elicit robust antitumor immunity. We started by making a series of azole molecules end&#8208;capped polyethylenimine (PEI&#8208;M), and we were surprised to find that over 60% of the PEI&#8208;M polymers had innate stimulating activity via activation of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway. PEI&#8208;4BImi, a PEI&#8208;M obtained from a series of polymers, elicited robust antitumor immune responses when used as a subcutaneously injected nanovaccine by simply mixing with ovalbumin (OVA) antigens, and this BiVax system performed much better than the traditional &#8220;ternary&#8221; vaccine system as well as commercialized aluminum&#8208;containing adjuvants. This system also enabled the fast preparation of personalized BiVax by compositing PEI&#8208;4BImi with autologous tumor cell membrane protein antigens, and a 60% postoperative cure rate was observed when combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors.

         <title>Oxide/ZIF&#8208;8 Hybrid Nanofiber Yarns: Heightened Surface Activity for Exceptional Chemiresistive Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Though highly promising as powerful gas sensors, oxide semiconductor chemiresistors have low surface reactivity, which limits their selectivity, sensitivity, and reaction kinetics, particularly at room&#8208;temperature (RT) operation. We propose that a hybrid design involving the nanostructuring of oxides and passivation with selective gas filtration layers can potentially overcome the issues with surface activity. Herein, we introduce unique bi&#8208;stacked heterogeneous layers, i.e., nanostructured oxides&#8208;covered by conformal nanoporous gas filters, on ultra&#8208;high density nanofiber yarns via sputter deposition with indium tin oxide (ITO) and subsequent self&#8208;assembly of zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF&#8208;8) nanocrystals. The nanofiber yarn composed of ZIF&#8208;8 coated ITO films could offer heightened surface activity at RT because of high porosity, large surface area, and effective screening of interfering gases. As a case study, our hybrid sensor demonstrated remarkable sensing performances characterized by high NO selectivity, fast response/recovery kinetics (&gt; 60&#8208;fold improvement), and large responses (12.8&#8208;fold improvement @ 1&#160;ppm) in comparison with pristine yarn@ITO, especially under highly humid condition. Molecular modeling revealed an increased penetration ratio of NO over O2 to ITO surface, indicating that NO oxidation was reliably prevented and that the secondary adsorption sites provided by ZIF&#8208;8 facilitated the adsorption/desorption of NO, both to and from ITO.

         <title>Molecular self&#8208;assembly Enables Tuning of Nanopores in Atomically Thin Graphene Membranes for Highly Selective Transport</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Atomically thin membranes comprising nanopores in a two&#8208;dimensional material promise to surpass the performance of polymeric membranes in several critical applications including water purification, chemical and gas separations, and energy harvesting. However, fabrication of membranes with precise pore size distributions that provide exceptionally high selectivity and permeance in a scalable framework remains an outstanding challenge. Circumventing these constraints, here we develop a platform technology that harnesses the ability of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes to self&#8208;assemble preferentially across larger, relatively leaky atomically thin nanopores by exploiting the lower steric hindrance of such larger pores to molecular interactions across the pore. By selectively tightening the pore size distribution in this manner, self&#8208;assembly of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes simultaneously introduced on opposite sides of nanoporous graphene membranes is demonstrated to discriminate between nanopores to seal non&#8208;selective transport channels, while minimally compromising smaller, water&#8208;selective pores, thereby remarkably attenuating solute leakage. This improved membrane selectivity enables desalination across centimeter&#8208;scale nanoporous graphene with 99.7% and &gt;90%&#160;rejection of MgSO4 and NaCl, respectively, under forward osmosis. These findings provide a versatile strategy to augment the performance of nanoporous atomically thin membranes and present intriguing possibilities of controlling reactions across two&#8208;dimensional materials via exclusive exploitation of pore size&#8208;dependent intermolecular interactions.

&lt;p&gt;Atomically thin membranes comprising nanopores in a two-dimensional material promise to surpass the performance of polymeric membranes in several critical applications including water purification, chemical and gas separations, and energy harvesting. However, fabrication of membranes with precise pore size distributions that provide exceptionally high selectivity and permeance in a scalable framework remains an outstanding challenge. Circumventing these constraints, here we develop a platform technology that harnesses the ability of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes to self-assemble preferentially across larger, relatively leaky atomically thin nanopores by exploiting the lower steric hindrance of such larger pores to molecular interactions across the pore. By selectively tightening the pore size distribution in this manner, self-assembly of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes simultaneously introduced on opposite sides of nanoporous graphene membranes is demonstrated to discriminate between nanopores to seal non-selective transport channels, while minimally compromising smaller, water-selective pores, thereby remarkably attenuating solute leakage. This improved membrane selectivity enables desalination across centimeter-scale nanoporous graphene with 99.7% and &amp;gt;90%&#160;rejection of MgSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and NaCl, respectively, under forward osmosis.

         <title>Two&#8208;dimensional FeP Nanoframe Superlattices via Space&#8208;Confined Topochemical Transformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled nanocrystal superlattices represent an emergent class of designer materials with potentially programmable functionalities. The ability to construct hierarchically structured nanocrystal superlattices with tailored geometry and porosity is critical for extending their applications. Here, two&#8208;dimensional (2D) superlattices comprised of monolayer FeP nanoframes are synthesized through a space&#8208;confined topochemical transformation approach induced by the Kirkendall effect, using carbon&#8208;coated Fe3O4 nanocube superlattices as a precursor. Both the particle shape and close&#8208;packed nature of Fe3O4 nanocubes as well as the interconnected carbon layer network contribute to the topochemical transformation process. The resulting 2D FeP nanoframe superlattices possess several unique and advantageous structural features that are unavailable in conventional 3D nanocrystal superlattices, which make them particularly attractive for catalytic applications. As a proof of concept, such 2D FeP nanoframe superlattices are harnessed as highly efficient and durable electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction, the performance of which is superior to that of most FeP&#8208;based catalysts reported previously. This topochemical transformation approach is scalable and general, representing a new route of designing hierarchical superlattices with highly open features that cannot be accessible by traditional self&#8208;assembly methods.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Insensitive Efficient Inorganic Perovskite Photovoltaics by Bulk Heterojunctions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Inorganic perovskite solar cells (IPSCs) emerge as ideal candidate for applications beyond terrestrial implementation due to their robustness. However, underlying mechanisms regarding their photovoltaic process at different temperatures remain unclear. Based on a stable absorber of CsPbI2.85(BrCl)0.15, we reveal considerable variation of corresponding device performance over temperature and further demonstrate a simple approach to an effective reduction of such variation. Interestingly, this absorber is found to be excitonic with poor carrier transport even at ambient temperature of 285 K and below. With a novel device configuration of PTB7&#8208;th/perovskite bulk heterojunction (BHJ), it facilitates exciton dissociation and carrier extraction. The resultant solar cell attains a best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.2% with the fill factor of 84%, which is the highest efficiency &#947;&#8208;phase IPSCs reported to date. Importantly, this device is less sensitive to operation temperature, wherein the PCE variation over the temperature range from 210 K to 360 K is 60% suppressed compared with the reference. The approach has been effectively extended to other IPSCs with different photo&#8208;active phase, which may shed light on realizing highly efficient IPSCs for specific scenarios such as polar regions, near space and exoplanet exploration.

         <title>Peritoneum&#8208;inspired Janus Porous Hydrogel with Anti&#8208;deformation, Anti&#8208;adhesion and Pro&#8208;healing Characteristics for Abdominal Wall Defect Treatment</title>

Abstract
Implantable meshes used in tension&#8208;free repair operation facilitate treatment of internal soft tissue defect. However, clinical meshes fail to achieve anti&#8208;deformation, anti&#8208;adhesion and pro&#8208;healing properties simultaneously, leading to undesirable surgery outcomes. Herein, inspired by peritoneum, a novel biocompatible Janus porous PVA hydrogel (JPVA hydrogel) is developed to achieve efficient repair of internal soft tissue defect by the facile yet efficient strategy based on top&#8208;down solvent exchange. The densely porous and smooth bottom&#8208;surface of JPVA hydrogel minimizes adhesion of fibroblasts and does not trigger any visceral adhesion, and its loose extracellular matrix&#8208;like porous and rough top&#8208;surface can significantly improve fibroblast adhesion and tissue growth, leading to superior abdominal wall defect treatment to commercially available PP and PCO meshes. With unique anti&#8208;swelling property (swelling ratio: 6.4%), our JPVA hydrogel has long&#8208;lasting anti&#8208;deformation performance and maintains high mechanical strength after immersing in PBS for 14 days, enabling tolerance to the maximum abdominal pressure in internal wet environment. By integrating visceral anti&#8208;adhesion and defect pro&#8208;healing with anti&#8208;deformation, JPVA hydrogel patch shows great prospect for efficient internal soft tissue defect repair.

         <title>Unraveling Heat Transport and Dissipation in Suspended MoSe2 from Bulk to Monolayer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Understanding heat flow in layered transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) crystals is crucial for applications exploiting these materials. Despite significant efforts, several basic thermal transport properties of TMDs are currently not well understood, in particular how transport is affected by material thickness and the material's environment. This combined experimental&#8208;theoretical study establishes a unifying physical picture of the intrinsic lattice thermal conductivity of the representative TMD MoSe2. Thermal conductivity measurements using Raman thermometry on a large set of clean, crystalline, suspended crystals with systematically varied thickness are combined with ab initio simulations with phonons at finite temperature. The results show that phonon dispersions and lifetimes change strongly with thickness, yet the thinnest TMD films exhibit an in&#8208;plane thermal conductivity that is only marginally smaller than that of bulk crystals. This is the result of compensating phonon contributions, in particular heat&#8208;carrying modes around &#8764;0.1&#160;THz in (sub)nanometer thin films, with a surprisingly long mean free path of several micrometers. This behavior arises directly from the layered nature of the material. Furthermore, out&#8208;of&#8208;plane heat dissipation to air molecules is remarkably efficient, in particular for the thinnest crystals, increasing the apparent thermal conductivity of monolayer MoSe2 by an order of magnitude. These results are crucial for the design of (flexible) TMD&#8208;based (opto&#8208;)electronic&#160;applications.

Abstract
Multilayer grating structures, such as those found on the wings of the butterfly Cynandra opis, are able to interact with light to generate structural coloration. When illuminated and viewed at defined angles, such structural color is characterized by exceptional purity and brightness. To provide further insight into the mechanism of structural coloration, we use two&#8208;photon laser lithography to fabricate bioinspired bigrating nanostructures, whose optical properties may be controlled by variation of the height and period of the grating features. Through the use of both spectral measurements and FEM simulations, we identify specific feature dimensions that due to the combined effects of multilayer interference and diffraction generate excellent spectral characteristics and high color purity over the entire visible range. Additionally, we demonstrate that variation of feature period and/or height plays a central role in controlling both hue and purity. Importantly, such tuneable bigrating structures are of significant utility in color filtering applications.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Oriented Antibody&#8208;Decorated Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanocrystals for Active&#8208;Targeting Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for the integration of oriented antibodies in MOFs is proposed. A synchrotron small angle X&#8208;ray scattering investigation demonstrates that the formation of the MOF (ZIF&#8208;C) is induced by the crystallizable fragment region (Fc) of antibodies, leaving the fragment antigen&#8208;binding (Fab) regions free to target antigens. ZIF&#8208;C*antibody particles are functionalized with fluorescent markers for active targeting and cancer cell imaging.








Abstract
Antibody (Ab)&#8208;targeted nanoparticles are becoming increasingly important for precision medicine. By controlling the Ab orientation, targeting properties can be enhanced; however, to afford such an ordered configuration, cumbersome chemical functionalization protocols are usually required. This aspect limits the progress of Abs&#8208;nanoparticles toward nanomedicine translation. Herein, a novel one&#8208;step synthesis of oriented monoclonal Ab&#8208;decorated metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanocrystals is presented. The crystallization of a zinc&#8208;based MOF, Zn2(mIM)2(CO3), from a solution of Zn2+ and 2&#8208;methylimidazole (mIM), is triggered by the fragment crystallizable (Fc) region of the Ab. This selective growth yields biocomposites with oriented Abs on the MOF nanocrystals (MOF*Ab): the Fc regions are partially inserted within the MOF surface and the antibody&#8208;binding regions protrude from the MOF surface toward the target. This ordered configuration imparts antibody&#8211;antigen recognition properties to the biocomposite and shows preserved target binding when compared to the parental antibodies. Next, the biosensing performance of the system is tested by loading MOF*Ab with luminescent quantum dots (QD). The targeting efficiency of the QD&#8208;containing MOF*Ab is again, fully preserved. The present work represents a simple self&#8208;assembly approach for the fabrication of antibody&#8208;decorated MOF nanocrystals with broad potential for sensing, diagnostic imaging, and targeted drug delivery.

         <title>Microstructurally Tailored Thin &#946;&#8208;Ag2Se Films toward Commercial Flexible Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ag can be quickly and directly converted into &#946;&#8208;Ag2Se at room temperature in aqueous solution. The fabricated flexible thin films show power factor and figure of merit (zT) values as high as 2590&#160;&#177; 414 &#181;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2 and 1.2&#160;&#177; 0.42, respectively. At &#8710;T&#160;= 30 K, a 4&#8208;leg flexible thermoelectric power generator shows high maximum output power density of 27.6&#160;&#177; 1.95 W m&#8722;2.








Abstract
Aiming to overcome both the structural and commercial limitations of flexible thermoelectric power generators, an efficient room&#8208;temperature aqueous selenization reaction that can be completed in air within less than 1&#160;min, to directly fabricate thin &#946;&#8208;Ag2Se films consisting of perfectly crystalline and large columnar grains with both in&#8208;plane randomness and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane [201] preferred orientation, is designed. A high power factor (PF) of 2590&#160;&#177; 414 &#181;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2 and a figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit (zT) of 1.2&#160;&#177; 0.42 are obtained from a sample with a thickness of &#8776;1&#160;&#181;m. The maximum output power density of the best 4&#8208;leg thermoelectric generator sample reach 27.6&#160;&#177; 1.95 and 124&#160;&#177; 8.78 W m&#8722;2 at room temperature with 30 and 60 K temperature differences, respectively, which may be useful in future flexible thermoelectric devices.

         <title>Capillary&#8208;Confinement Crystallization for Monolayer Molecular Crystal Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general solution procedure named the &#8220;soft&#8208;template&#8208;assisted&#8208;assembly method&#8221; is developed to prepare centimeter&#8208;scale monolayer molecular crystal (MMC) arrays with precise regulation over their size and location. The MMC&#8208;based field&#8208;effect transistors show extraordinary uniformity with the lowest coefficient of variation on record (4.4%). The direct observation and fluent simulations of the formation of MMCs show that the crystallization process is confined via capillary.








Abstract
Organic single&#8208;crystalline semiconductors are highly desired for the fabrication of integrated electronic circuits, yet their uniform growth and efficient patterning is a huge challenge. Here, a general solution procedure named the &#8220;soft&#8208;template&#8208;assisted&#8208;assembly method&#8221; is developed to prepare centimeter&#8208;scale monolayer molecular crystal (MMC) arrays with precise regulation over their size and location via a capillary&#8208;confinement crystallization process. It is remarkable that the field&#8208;effect mobility of the array is highly uniform, with variation less than 4.4%, which demonstrates the most uniform organic single&#8208;crystal arrays ever reported so far. Simulations based on fluid dynamics are carried out to understand the function mechanism of this method. Thanks to the ultrasmooth crystalline orientation surface of MMCs, high&#8208;quality p&#8211;n heterojunction arrays can be prepared by weak epitaxy growth of n&#8208;type material atop the MMC. The p&#8211;n heterojunction field&#8208;effect transistors show ambipolar characteristics and the corresponding inverters constructed by these heterojunctions exhibit a competitive gain of 155. This work provides a general strategy to realize the preparation and application of logic complementary circuits based on patterned organic single crystals.

         <title>A Mechanically Interlocking Strategy Based on Conductive Microbridges for Stretchable Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solderless stretchable interconnections (SLSIs) are developed to realize the assembly of individual soft devices toward multifunctional all&#8208;stretchable integrated platforms. This stretchable interconnection can effectively bridge interlayer conductivity with tight adhesion through regional functionality. SLSIs show promising stretchability up to a strain of 35% (R/R0&#160;&#8804; 5) and can be adopted to achieve an all&#8208;stretchable self&#8208;powered data acquisition platform.








Abstract
Stretchable electronics incorporating critical sensing, data transmission, display and powering functionalities, is crucial to emerging wearable healthcare applications. To date, methods to achieve stretchability of individual functional devices have been extensively investigated. However, integration strategies of these stretchable devices to achieve all&#8208;stretchable systems are still under exploration, in which the reliable stretchable interconnection is a key element. Here, solderless stretchable interconnections based on mechanically interlocking microbridges are developed to realize the assembly of individual stretchable devices onto soft patternable circuits toward multifunctional all&#8208;stretchable platforms. This stretchable interconnection can effectively bridge interlayer conductivity with tight adhesion through both conductive microbridges and selectively distributed adhesive polymer. Consequently, enhanced stretchability up to a strain of 35% (R/R0&#160;&#8804; 5) is shown, compared with conventional solder&#8208;assisted connections which lose electrical conduction at a strain of less than 5% (R/R0&#160;&#8776; 30). As a proof of concept, a self&#8208;powered all&#8208;stretchable data&#8208;acquisition platform is fabricated by surface mounting a stretchable strain sensor and a supercapacitor onto a soft circuit through solderless interconnections. This solderless interconnecting strategy for surface&#8208;mountable devices can be utilized as a valuable technology for the integration of stretchable devices to achieve all&#8208;soft multifunctional systems.

As a proof of concept, a self-powered all-stretchable data-acquisition platform is fabricated by surface mounting a stretchable strain sensor and a supercapacitor onto a soft circuit through solderless interconnections. This solderless interconnecting strategy for surface-mountable devices can be utilized as a valuable technology for the integration of stretchable devices to achieve all-soft multifunctional systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hysteresis&#8208;Free Nanoparticle&#8208;Reinforced Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly swollen, low&#8208;crosslinking&#8208;density polymer hydrogel reinforced with hyperbranched silica nanoparticles is absent of temporary entanglement and effectively avoids hysteresis during extensive cyclic tensile tests. This work provides a universal design principle for hysteresis&#8208;free hydrogels, leading to better antifatigue performances.








Abstract
The elastic storage and release of mechanical energy has been key to many developments throughout the history of mankind. Resilience, absent hysteresis, has been an elusive goal to achieve, particularly at large deformations. Using a low&#8208;crosslink&#8208;density polyacrylamide hydrogel at 96% water content having hyperbranched silica nanoparticles (HBSPs) as the major junction points, a hysteresis&#8208;free material is realized. The fatigue&#8208;free characteristic of these composite hydrogels is evidenced by the invariance of the stress&#8211;strain curves at strain ratios of 4, even after 5000 cycles. At a strain ratio of 7, only a 1.3% hysteresis is observed. A markedly increased strain&#8208;ratio&#8208;at&#8208;break of 11.5 is observed. The unique attributes of these resilient hydrogels are manifested in the high&#8208;fidelity detection of dynamic deformations under cyclic loading over a broad range of frequencies, difficult to achieve with other materials.

         <title>Engineering Metallic Heterostructure Based on Ni3N and 2M&#8208;MoS2 for Alkaline Water Electrolysis with Industry&#8208;Compatible Current Density and Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Alkaline water electrolysis is commercially desirable to realize large&#8208;scale hydrogen production. Although non&#8208;precious catalysts exhibit high electrocatalytic activity at low current density (10&#8208;50&#160;mA cm&#8211;2), it is still challenging to achieve industrially&#8208;required current density over 500&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 due to inefficient electron transport and competitive adsorption between hydroxyl and water. Herein, we design a novel metallic heterostructure based on nickel nitride and monoclinic molybdenum disulfide (Ni3N@2M&#8208;MoS2) for extraordinary water electrolysis. The Ni3N@2M&#8208;MoS2 composite with heterointerface provides two kinds of separated reaction sites to overcome the steric hindrance of competitive hydroxyl/water adsorption. The kinetically decoupled hydroxyl/water adsorption/dissociation and metallic conductivity of Ni3N@2M&#8208;MoS2 enable hydrogen production from Ni3N and oxygen evolution from the heterointerface at large current density. The metallic heterostructure is proved to be imperative for the stabilization and activation of Ni3N@2M&#8208;MoS2, which could efficiently regulate the active electronic states of Ni/N atoms around the Fermi&#8208;level through the charge transfer between the active atoms of Ni3N and Mo&#8208;Mo bonds of 2M&#8208;MoS2 to boost overall water splitting. The Ni3N@2M&#8208;MoS2 incorporated water electrolyzer requires ultralow cell voltage of 1.644 V@1000&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 with &#8764;100% retention over 300 h, far exceeding the commercial Pt/C&#9553;RuO2 (2.41 V@1000&#160;mA cm&#8211;2, 100 h, 58.2%).

         <title>Metal&#8208;organic framework glass anode with an exceptional cycling&#8208;induced capacity enhancement for lithium&#8208;ion batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) hold great promise as high&#8208;energy anode materials for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) due to their tunable chemistry, pore structure and abundant reaction sites. However, the pore structure of crystalline MOFs tends to collapse during lithium&#8208;ion insertion and extraction, and hence, their electrochemical performances are rather limited. As a critical breakthrough, a MOF glass anode for LIBs has been developed in the present work. In detail, it was fabricated by melt&#8208;quenching Cobalt&#8208;ZIF&#8208;62 (Co(Im)1.75(bIm)0.25) to glass, and then by combining glass with carbon black and binder. The derived anode exhibits high lithium storage capacity (306 mAh g&#8211;1 after 1000 cycles at of 2 A g&#8211;1), outstanding cycling stability and superior rate performance compared with the crystalline Cobalt&#8208;ZIF&#8208;62 and the amorphous one prepared by high&#8208;energy ball&#8208;milling. Importantly, it was found that the Li&#8208;ion storage capacity of the MOF glass anode continuously rises with charge&#8208;discharge cycling and even tripled after 1000 cycles. Combined spectroscopic and structural analyses, along with density functional theory calculations, revealed the origin of the unusual cycling&#8208;enhancement of the performances of the MOF glass anode, that is, increased distortion and local breakage of the Co&#8208;N coordination making the Li&#8208;ion intercalation sites more accessible.

         <title>Differential polymer chain scission enables free&#8208;standing microcavity laser arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Control over material architectures is essential to the performance of photonic devices and systems. Optical isolation of the photonic materials from substrates can significantly enhance their performance but suffers from complicated fabrication processes and limited applications. Here we propose a differential polymer chain scission strategy to fabricate free&#8208;standing photonic structures based on one&#8208;step electron&#8208;beam direct writing on polymer bilayers (EOB). The polymer molecular mass&#8208;dependent sensitivity to electron beam enables differential patterning of the two layers of polymers, leading to the direct formation of suspended optical microcavities. The EOB technique features high materials compatibility and design flexibility for the optical microcavities, which significantly expands the application scope of the suspended optical microcavities. As well as providing a versatile strategy for building high&#8208;performance photonic materials, our results provide a promising platform for innovative applications of optical microstructures.

&lt;p&gt;Control over material architectures is essential to the performance of photonic devices and systems. Optical isolation of the photonic materials from substrates can significantly enhance their performance but suffers from complicated fabrication processes and limited applications. Here we propose a differential polymer chain scission strategy to fabricate free-standing photonic structures based on one-step electron-beam direct writing on polymer bilayers (EOB). The polymer molecular mass-dependent sensitivity to electron beam enables differential patterning of the two layers of polymers, leading to the direct formation of suspended optical microcavities. The EOB technique features high materials compatibility and design flexibility for the optical microcavities, which significantly expands the application scope of the suspended optical microcavities. As well as providing a versatile strategy for building high-performance photonic materials, our results provide a promising platform for innovative applications of optical microstructures.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Metal&#8211;Phenolic&#8208;Network&#8208;Coated Dendrimer&#8211;Drug Conjugates for Tumor MR Imaging and Chemo/Chemodynamic Therapy via Amplification of Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;phenolic&#8208;network&#8208;coated dendrimer&#8211;drug conjugates are constructed as a novel theranostic nanoplatform based on endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) amplification. The generated nanocomplexes can responsively release the ERS drug toyocamycin in the tumor microenvironment, while the coated iron&#8211;tannic acid network can generate cytotoxic hydroxyl radicals, thus rendering ERS amplification for combined chemo/chemodynamic therapy of tumors under the guidance of magnetic resonance imaging.








Abstract
Amplification of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) to realize enhanced cancer therapy has been considered to be unique in current cancer nanomedicine design. Herein, the design of metal&#8211;phenolic&#8208;network&#8208;coated dendrimer&#8211;drug conjugates as a novel theranostic nanoplatform based on ERS amplification is reported. In the design, acetylated generation&#8208;5 poly(amidoamine) dendrimers are conjugated with an ERS drug, toyocamycin (Toy), through the attached phenylboronic acid moiety, and coated with an iron (Fe)&#8211;tannic acid (TF) network. The generated nanocomplexes with a size of 50.2&#160;nm are stable under the physiological environment, and can rapidly release Toy under the tumor microenvironment due to the pH&#8208; and reactive&#8208;oxygen&#8208;species&#8208;responsive boronic ester bonds to effectively inhibit the ERS&#8208;mediated cancer cell adaptation. Meanwhile, the coated TF network enables the nanocomplexes to generate cytotoxic hydroxyl radicals through a Fenton reaction, amplifying the ERS for improved chemo/chemodynamic therapy of cancer cells in vitro and a xenografted breast tumor model in vivo. Moreover, the coating of TF also renders the complexes with an eminent r1 relaxivity for in vivo T1&#8208;weighted tumor magnetic resonance imaging. The created intelligent nanocomplexes may represent an advanced nanomedicine formulation uniquely integrated with a metal&#8211;phenolic network and dendrimer nanotechnology for imaging&#8208;guided cancer therapy through ERS amplification.

         <title>Modulating Tumor Extracellular Matrix by Simultaneous Inhibition of Two Cancer Cell Receptors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The extracellular matrix (ECM) is involved in fundamental cellular processes and pathological progression of many diseases. While most research and current knowledge focuses on the processes of biological and mechanical changes in ECM signaling residing cancer cells to respond, little is known of the converse&#8211;of how cancer cells initiate the changes of ECM properties. Here, we report that blocking the cancer cell signaling leads to disruption of tumor ECM. Using recombinant proteins (RPs) and recombinant protein&#8208;drug conjugates (RPDCs) that simultaneously target both epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and integrin, we demonstrated that multi&#8208;receptor&#8208;mediated active modulation of tumor ECM (mRMM&#8208;ECM) can inhibit and even reverse tumor remodeling of the physiological and structural microenvironment. These results not only provide insights into the regulatory roles of cancer cells in developing a pro&#8208;tumoral microenvironment, but also introduce a new therapeutic platform or strategy to treat cancers.

         <title>Sunlight&#8208;coordinated high&#8208;performance Moisture Power in Natural Condition</title>

Abstract
It is of challenge to spontaneously harvest multiple clean sources from environment for upgraded energy converting system. The ubiquitous moisture and sunlight in the nature are attractive for sustainable power generation especially. We herein develop a high&#8208;performance light&#8208;coordinated moist&#8208;electric generator (LMEG) based on the rational combination of polyelectrolyte and phytochrome. By spontaneous adsorption of gaseous water molecules and simultaneous exposure to sunlight, a piece of 1 cm2 composite film with a thickness of 0.56&#160;mm offers an open circuit voltage of 0.92&#160;V and a considerable short&#8208;circuit&#8208;current density of up to 1.55&#160;mA cm&#8208;2. This record high current density is about two orders of magnitude improvement over that of most conventional moisture&#8208;enabled generation, which is caused by the moisture&#8208;induced charge separation companied with photoexcited carrier migration as confirmed by a dynamic Monte Carlo device simulation. Flexible devices with customizable size are available for large&#8208;scale integration to effectively work under the wide range of relative humidity (about 20%&#8210;100%), temperature (10&#8210;80&#160;&#176;C) and light intensity (30&#8210;200&#160;mW cm&#8210;2). The wearable and portable LMEGs provide ample power supply in the natural conditions for indoor and outdoor electricity consuming systems such as lighting and electrically&#8208;driven objects. This work opens a novel avenue to develop green and sustainable power generation through simultaneously collecting multi&#8208;types of natural energy by a single hybrid harvester.

         <title>Reshaping Tumor Immune Microenvironment Based on Light Activated Nano&#8208;Platform for Efficient Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) always cause poor antitumor immune efficacy, prone to relapse and metastasis. Herein, a novel polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) modified BiFeO3/Bi2WO6 (BFO/BWO) with p&#8208;n type heterojunction was constructed for reshaping immunosuppressive TME. Reactive oxygen species could be generated under light activation by the well separation of hole (h+)&#8208;electron (e&#8722;) pairs owing to the heterojunction in BFO/BWO&#8208;PVP NPs. Interestingly, the h+ can trigger the decomposition of H2O2 to generate O2 for alleviating tumor hypoxia, which not only sensitizes photodynamic therapy (PDT) and radiotherapy (RT), but also promotes the tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) polarization from M2 to M1 phenotype, beneficial to decrease the expression of HIF&#8208;1&#945;. Importantly, such a light activated nano&#8208;platform combing with RT could efficiently activate and recruit cytotoxic T lymphocytes to infiltrate in tumor tissues, as well as stimulate TAMs to M1 phenotype, dramatically reverse the immunosuppressive TME into the immunoactive one and further boost immune memory responses. Moreover, BFO/BWO&#8208;PVP NPs also present high performance of computed tomography imaging contrast. Taken together, this work offers a novel paradigm for achieving O2 self&#8208;supplement of inorganic nano&#8208;agent and reshaping tumor immune microenvironment to effective inhibition of cancer as well as metastasis and recurrence.

         <title>Ionic liquid treatment for highest&#8208;efficiency ambient printed stable all&#8208;inorganic CsPbI3 perovskite solar cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
All&#8208;inorganic cesium lead triiodide (CsPbI3) perovskite is well known for its unparalleled stability at high temperatures up to 500&#160;&#176;C and under oxidative chemical stresses. However, upscaling solar cells via ambient printing suffers from imperfect crystal quality and defects caused by uncontrollable crystallization. Herein, we report that the incorporation of a low concentration of novel ionic liquid is promising for managing defects in CsPbI3 film, interfacial energy alignment and device stability of solar cells fabricated via ambient blade&#8208;coating. Both theoretical simulations and experimental measurements reveal that the ionic liquid successfully regulates the perovskite thin&#8208;film growth to decrease perovskite grain boundaries, strongly coordinates with the undercoordinated Pb2+ to passivate iodide vacancy defects, aligns interface to decrease energy barrier at the electron transporting layer by 280 meV, and relaxes the lattice strain to effectively promote phase stability. Consequently, we achieved high&#8208;efficiency ambient printed CsPbI3 solar cells with PCE as high as 20.01% under 1 sun illumination (100&#160;mW cm&#8722;2) and 37.24% under indoor light illumination (1000 lux, 365 &#956;W cm&#8722;2), both are the highest for the printed all&#8208;inorganic cells for corresponding applications. Furthermore, the bare cells without any encapsulation showed an impressive long&#8208;term ambient stability with only &#8764;5% PCE degradation after 1000 h aging under ambient condition.

Both theoretical simulations and experimental measurements reveal that the ionic liquid successfully regulates the perovskite thin-film growth to decrease perovskite grain boundaries, strongly coordinates with the undercoordinated Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to passivate iodide vacancy defects, aligns interface to decrease energy barrier at the electron transporting layer by 280 meV, and relaxes the lattice strain to effectively promote phase stability. Consequently, we achieved high-efficiency ambient printed CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; solar cells with PCE as high as 20.01% under 1 sun illumination (100&#160;mW cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and 37.24% under indoor light illumination (1000 lux, 365 &#956;W cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), both are the highest for the printed all-inorganic cells for corresponding applications. Furthermore, the bare cells without any encapsulation showed an impressive long-term ambient stability with only &#8764;5% PCE degradation after 1000 h aging under ambient condition.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Rapid Identification of DNA Fragments through Direct Sequencing with Electro&#8208;Optical Zero&#8208;Mode Waveguides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
In contrast to sequence&#8208;specific techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), DNA sequencing does not require prior knowledge of the sample for surveying DNA. However, current sequencing technologies demand high inputs for a suitable library preparation, which typically necessitates DNA amplification, even for single&#8208;molecule sequencing methods. Here, we present electro&#8208;optical zero&#8208;mode waveguides (eZMWs), which can load DNA into the confinement of zero&#8208;mode waveguides with high efficiency and negligible DNA fragment length bias. Using eZMWs, we observe highly efficient voltage&#8208;induced loading of DNA fragments of various sizes from ultralow inputs (ng&#8208;to&#8208;pg levels). We demonstrate rapid DNA fragment identification by burst sequencing of short and long DNA molecules (260&#160;bp and 20000&#160;bp) loaded from an equimolar pM&#8208;level concentration mixture in just a few&#8208;minutes. Our device allows further studies in which low&#8208;input DNA capture is essential, for example, in epigenetics, where native DNA is required for obtaining modified base information.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;Up&#8208;Etching&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of Large&#8208;Scale Pure Monolayer Graphene on Cyclic&#8208;Polishing&#8208;Annealed Cu(111)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cyclic electrochemical polishing and thermal annealing approach that allows the effective conversion from commercial Cu to single&#8208;crystal Cu(111) foils is reported. Using Cu(111), a general &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8208;etching&#8221; method is developed for producing pure monolayer graphene film with high and uniform electronic quality. This work provides new ways and mechanisms to address these key issues.








Abstract
Synthesis of large&#8208;scale single&#8208;crystalline graphene monolayers without multilayers involves the fabrication of proper single&#8208;crystalline substrates and the ubiquitous formation of multilayered graphene islands during chemical vapor deposition. Here, a method of cyclic electrochemical polishing combined with thermal annealing, which allows the conversion of commercial polycrystalline Cu foils to single&#8208;crystal Cu(111) with an almost 100% yield, is presented. A global &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8208;etching&#8221; method that is capable of fabricating large&#8208;area pure single&#8208;crystalline graphene monolayers without multilayers through selectively etching bottom multilayered graphene underneath large area as&#8208;grown graphene monolayer on Cu(111) surface is demonstrated. Terahertz time&#8208;domain spectroscopy (THz&#8208;TDS) measurement of the pure monolayer graphene film shows a high average sheet conductivity of 2.8 mS and mean carrier mobility of 6903 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 over a large area. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the selective etching is induced by the much easier diffusion of hydrogen atoms than hydrocarbon radicals across the edges of the top graphene layer, and the simulated selective etching processes based on phase field modeling are well consistent with experimental observations. This work provides new ways toward the production of single&#8208;crystal Cu(111) and the synthesis of pure monolayer graphene with high electronic quality.

         <title>Monolithic All&#8208;Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells with Minimized Optical and Energetic Losses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Perovskite&#8208;based multijunction solar cells are a potentially cost&#8208;effective technology that can help surpass the efficiency limits of single&#8208;junction devices. However, both mixed&#8208;halide wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites and lead&#8208;tin narrow&#8208;bandgap perovskites suffer from non&#8208;radiative recombination due to the formation of bulk traps and interfacial recombination centers which limit the open&#8208;circuit voltage of sub&#8208;cells and consequently of the integrated tandem. Additionally, the complex optical stack in a multijunction solar cell can lead to losses stemming from parasitic absorption and reflection of incident light which aggravates the current mismatch between sub&#8208;cells, thereby limiting the short&#8208;circuit current density of the tandem. Here, we present an integrated all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cell that uses surface passivation strategies to reduce non&#8208;radiative recombination at the perovskite&#8208;fullerene interfaces, yielding a high open&#8208;circuit voltage. By using optically benign transparent electrode and charge&#8208;transport layers, absorption in the narrow&#8208;bandgap sub&#8208;cell is improved, leading to an improvement in current&#8208;matching between sub&#8208;cells. Collectively, these strategies allow the development of a monolithic tandem solar cell exhibiting a power&#8208;conversion efficiency of over 23%.

         <title>Machine Learning Guided Dopant Selection for Metal Oxide based Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting: The Case Study of Fe2O3 and CuO</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Doping is an effective strategy for tuning metal oxide based semiconductors for solar&#8208;driven photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. Despite decades of extensive research effort, the dopant selection is still largely dependent on a trial&#8208;and&#8208;error approach. Machine learning (ML) is promising in providing predictable insights on the dopant selection for high&#8208;performing PEC systems because it can uncover correlations from the seemingly ambiguous linkages between vast features of dopants and the PEC performance of doped photoelectrodes. Herein, we successfully build ML model to predict the doping effect of 17 metal dopants into hematite (Fe2O3), a prototype photoelectrode material. Our findings disclose the critical parameters from the 10 intrinsic features of each dopant. The model is further experimentally validated by the coherent prediction on Y and La dopants&#8217; behaviors. Further interpretation of the ML model suggests that the chemical state is the most significant selection criteria, meanwhile, dopants with higher metal&#8208;oxygen bond formation enthalpy and larger ionic radius are favored in improving the charge separation and transfer (CST) in the Fe2O3 photoanodes. The generic feature of this ML guided selection criteria has been further extended to CuO&#8208;based photoelectrodes showing improved CST by alkaline metal ions doping.

         <title>A Stiffness&#8208;Switchable, Biomimetic Smart Material Enabled by Supramolecular Reconfiguration</title>

Abstract
In nature, stiffness&#8208;changing behavior is essential for living organisms, which, however, is challenging to achieve in synthetic materials. Here, we report a stiffness&#8208;changing smart material by developing the interchangeable supramolecular configurations inspired from dermis of sea cucumber, which shows extreme, switchable mechanical properties. At hydrated state, the material, owning a stretched, double&#8208;stranded supramolecular network, showcases a soft&#8208;gel behaviour with a low stiffness and high pliability. Upon the stimulation of ethanol to transform into the coiled supramolecular configuration, it self&#8208;adjusts to be a hard matter with nearly 500&#8208;times enhanced stiffness from 0.51 to 243.6&#160;MPa, outstanding load&#8208;bearing capability (over 35,000 times its own weight), and excellent puncture/impact resistance with a specific impact strength of &#8764;116&#160;kJ m&#8722;2 (g cm&#8722;3)&#8722;1 (higher than some metals and alloys such as aluminum, and even comparable to the commercially available protective materials such as D3O and Kevlar). Moreover, this material demonstrates reconfiguration&#8208;dependent self&#8208;healing behavior and designable formability, holding great promise in advanced engineering fields that requires both high&#8208;strength durability and good formability. This work may open up a new perspective for the development of self&#8208;regulating materials from the supramolecular&#8208;scale configuration regulation.

         <title>Two&#8208;dimensional Materials for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Lithium Batteries</title>

Abstract
Although one of the most mature battery technologies, lithium&#8208;ion batteries still have many aspects that have not reached the desired requirements, such as energy density, current density, safety, environmental compatibility, and price. To solve these problems, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLB) based on lithium metal anodes with high energy density and safety have been proposed and become a research hotpot in recent years. Due to the advanced electrochemical properties of two&#8208;dimensional materials (2DM), they have been applied to mitigate some of the current problems of ASSLBs, such as high interface impedance and low electrolyte ionic conductivity. In this work, the background and fabrication method of 2DMs are reviewed initially. The improvement strategies of 2DMs are categorized based on their application in the three main components of ASSLBs: The anode, cathode, and electrolyte. Finally, to elucidate the mechanisms of 2DMs in ASSLBs, the role of in&#8208;situ characterization, synchrotron X&#8208;ray techniques and other advanced characterization are discussed.

         <title>Highly Transparent and Self&#8208;Healable Solar Thermal Anti&#8208;/De&#8208;Icing Surfaces: When Ultrathin MXene Multilayers Marry Solid Slippery Self&#8208;Cleaning Coating</title>

Abstract
Solar anti&#8208;/de&#8208;icing can solve icing problems by converting sunlight into heat. One of the biggest problems, which has long been plaguing the design of solar anti&#8208;/de&#8208;icing surfaces, is that photothermal materials are always lightproof and appear black, because of the mutual exclusiveness between generating heat and retaining transparency. Herein, we report a highly transparent and scalable solar anti&#8208;/de&#8208;icing surface, which enables the coated glass to exhibit high transparency (&gt;77% transmittance at 550&#160;nm) and meanwhile, causes a &gt;30&#176;C&#160;surface temperature increase relative to ambient under 1.0 sun illumination. Such a transparent anti&#8208;/de&#8208;icing surface can be fabricated onto a large class of substrates (e.g., glass, ceramics, metals, plastics), by applying a solid omniphobic slippery coating onto layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembled ultrathin MXene multilayers. Hence, the surface possesses self&#8208;cleaning ability to shed waterborne and oil&#8208;based liquids thanks to residue&#8208;free slipping motion. Passive anti&#8208;icing and active de&#8208;icing capabilities are, respectively, obtained on the solar thermal surface, which effectively prevents water from freezing and simultaneously melts pre&#8208;formed ice and thick frost. The self&#8208;cleaning effect enables residue&#8208;free removal of unfrozen water and interfacially melted ice/frost to boost the anti&#8208;/de&#8208;icing efficiency. Importantly, the surface is capable of self&#8208;healing under illumination to repair physical damage and chemical degradation.

Abstract
Photocatalysis is a green technology to use ubiquitous and intermittent sunlight. The emerging S&#8208;scheme heterojunction has demonstrated its superiority in photocatalysis. This article covers the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art progress and provides new insights into its general designing criteria. It starts with the challenges confronted by single photocatalyst from the perspective of energy dissipation by borrowing the common behaviors in the dye molecule. Subsequently, other problems faced by single photocatalyst are summarized. Then a viable solution for these problems is the construction of heterojunctions. To overcome the problems and mistakes of type&#8208;II and Z&#8208;scheme heterojunctions, S&#8208;scheme heterojunction is proposed and the underlying reaction mechanism is summarized. Afterward, the design principles for S&#8208;scheme heterojunction are proposed and four types of S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions are suggested. Following this, direct characterization techniques for testifying the charge transfer in S&#8208;scheme heterojunction are presented. Finally, different photocatalytic applications of S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions are summarized. Specifically, this work endeavors to clarify the critical understanding on curved Fermi level in S&#8208;schem2e heterojunction interface, which can help strengthen and advance the fundamental theories of photocatalysis. Moreover, the current challenges and prospects of the S&#8208;scheme heterojunction photocatalyst are critically discussed.

         <title>A New Durable Surface Nanoparticles&#8208;Modified Perovskite Cathode for Protonic Ceramic Fuel Cells from Selective Cation Exsolution under Oxidizing Atmosphere</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
A high&#8208;performance cathode of a protonic ceramic fuel cell (PCFC) should possess excellent oxygen reduction reactivity, high proton/oxygen&#8208;ion/electron conductivity, and sufficient operational stability, thus requiring a delicate tuning of both the bulk and surface properties of the electrode material. Although surface modification of perovskites with nanoparticles from reducing&#8208;atmosphere exsolution has been demonstrated effective at improving the electrochemical anodic oxidation, such nanoparticles would easily re&#8208;incorporate into the perovskite lattice causing a big challenge for their application as cathode. Here, we report a durable perovskite&#8208;based nanocomposite cathode for PCFC, which is facilely prepared via the exsolution of nanoparticles in an oxidizing atmosphere. Through composition and cation nonstoichiometry manipulation, a precursor with the nominal composition of Ba0.95(Co0.4Fe0.4Zr0.1Y0.1)0.95Ni0.05O3&#8208;&#948; (BCFZYN&#8208;095) is designed, synthesized, and investigated, which, upon calcination, gives rise to the formation of a perovskite&#8208;based nanocomposite comprising a major perovskite phase and a minor NiO phase enriched on the perovskite surface. The major perovskite phase enabled by the proper cation nonstoichiometry manipulation promotes bulk proton conduction while the NiO nanoparticles facilitate oxygen surface exchange process, leading to superior cathodic performance with a maximum peak power density of 1040&#160;mW cm&#8211;2 at 650&#176;C and an excellent operational stability of 400 h at 550&#176;C.

         <title>Escalating ferromagnetic order via Se&#8208;vacancy near vanadium in WSe2 monolayer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Magnetic order has been proposed to arise from a variety of defects including vacancies, anti&#8208;sites, and grain&#8208;boundaries, which are relevant in numerous electronics and spintronics applications. Nevertheless, its magnetism remains controversial due to the lack of structural analysis. We herein demonstrate the escalation of ferromagnetism in vanadium&#8208;doped WSe2 monolayer by tailoring complex configurations of Se vacancies via post heat&#8208;treatment.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnetic order has been proposed to arise from a variety of defects including vacancies, anti-sites, and grain-boundaries, which are relevant in numerous electronics and spintronics applications. Nevertheless, its magnetism remains controversial due to the lack of structural analysis. We herein demonstrate the escalation of ferromagnetism in vanadium-doped WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; monolayer by tailoring complex configurations of Se vacancies via post heat-treatment. Structural analysis of atomic defects was systematically performed using transmission electron microscopy, enabled by monolayer nature. Temperature-dependent magnetoresistance hysteresis ensures enhanced magnetic order after high-temperature heat-treatment, consistent with magnetic domain analysis from magnetic force microscopy. The vanadium &#8211; Se vacancy pairing is a key to promote ferromagnetism via spin-flip by electron transfer, predicted from density-functional-theory calculations. Our approach towards nano-defect engineering paves a way to overcome weak magnetic order in diluted magnetic semiconductors for renovating semiconductor spintronics.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Nanovesicle&#8208;mediated targeted delivery of immune checkpoint blockades to potentiate therapeutic efficacy and prevent side effects</title>

Abstract
Despite the clinically proven efficacies of immune checkpoint blockades, including anti&#8208;cytotoxic T lymphocyte&#8208;associated protein 4 antibody (&#945;CTLA&#8208;4), the low response rate and immune&#8208;related adverse events (irAEs) in cancer patients represent major drawbacks of the therapy. These drawbacks of &#945;CTLA&#8208;4 therapy are mainly due to the suboptimal activation of tumor&#8208;specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and the systemic non&#8208;specific activation of T cells. To overcome such drawbacks, &#945;CTLA&#8208;4 was delivered by dendritic cell&#8208;derived nanovesicles presenting tumor antigens (DCNV&#8208;TAs) that exclusively interact with tumor&#8208;specific T cells, leading to selective activation of tumor&#8208;specific CTLs. Compared to conventional &#945;CTLA&#8208;4 therapy, treatment with &#945;CTLA&#8208;4&#8208;conjugated DCNV&#8208;TAs significantly inhibited tumor growth and reduced irAEs in syngeneic tumor&#8208;bearing mice. This study demonstrates that the spatiotemporal presentation of both &#945;CTLA&#8208;4 and tumor antigens enables selective activation of tumor&#8208;specific T cells and potentiates the antitumor efficacy of &#945;CTLA&#8208;4 without inducing systemic irAEs.

         <title>Mass&#8208;Manufactured Beam&#8208;Steering Metasurfaces for High&#8208;Speed Full&#8208;Duplex Optical Wireless&#8208;Broadcasting Communications</title>

Assisted by an silicon&#8208;on&#8208;isolator&#8208;based metasurface that can be mass&#8208;manufactured by the complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) process, an ultracompact prototype for full&#8208;duplex metabroadcasting communications is demonstrated, which shows beam&#8208;steering angles up to &#177;40&#176;, 14 broadcasting channels with capacity for downstream and upstream links up to 100 and 10&#160;Gbps for each user channel, and three operating modes for flexible signal switching.








Abstract
Beam&#8208;steering devices, which are at the heart of optical wireless&#8208;broadcasting communication links, play an important role in data allocation and exchange. An ideal beam&#8208;steering device features large steering angles, arbitrary channel numbers, reconfigurability, and ultracompactness. However, these criteria have been achieved only partially with conventional beam&#8208;steering devices based on waveguides, micro&#8208;electricalmechanical systems, spatial light modulators, and gratings, which will substantially limit the application of optical wireless&#8208;broadcasting communication techniques. In this study, an ultracompact full&#8208;duplex metabroadcasting communication system is designed and experimentally demonstrated, which exhibits beam steering angles up to &#177;40&#176;, 14 broadcasting channels with capacity for downstream and upstream links up to 100 and 10&#160;Gbps for each user channel, three operating modes for flexible signal switching, and metadevice dimensions as small as 2&#160;mm&#160;&#215;&#160;2&#160;mm. In particular, the beam&#8208;steering metadevices are mass&#8208;manufactured by a complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) processing platform, which shows their potential for large&#8208;scale commercial applications. The demonstrated metabroadcasting communication system merges optical wireless&#8208;broadcasting communications and metasurfaces, which reduces the complexity of beam&#8208;steering devices while significantly increasing their performance, opening up a new avenue for high&#8208;quality optical wireless&#8208;broadcasting communications.

         <title>Rational Design of Covalent Heptazine Frameworks with Spatially Separated Redox Centers for High&#8208;Efficiency Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent heptazine frameworks (CHFs) with spatially separated redox centers are rationally designed from the molecular level. The spatial separation feature is critical for enhancing surface charge separation and achieving efficient H2O2 production. This study establishes a new foundation for the future development of metal&#8208;free polymer photocatalysts toward various photocatalytic overall reactions.








Abstract
The redox reaction centers in natural organisms conducting oxygenic photosynthesis are well arranged in a physically separated manner to convert sunlight into chemical energy efficiently. Mimicking natural photosynthesis via precisely constructing oxidative and reductive reaction centers within photocatalysts is ideal for enhancing catalytic performances in artificial photosynthesis. In this study, new covalent heptazine frameworks (CHFs) with spatially separated redox centers are rationally designed for photocatalytic production of H2O2 from water and oxygen without using any sacrificial agents. Both experimental and computational investigations indicate that the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction occurs on the heptazine moiety, whereas the two&#8208;electron water oxidation reaction occurs on the acetylene or diacetylene bond in the CHFs. This unique spatial separation feature is critical for enhancing charge separation and achieving efficient H2O2 production. Meanwhile, the measured exciton binding energy of the diacetylene&#8208;containing polymer is merely 24 meV. Under simulated solar irradiation, the rationally designed CHFs can achieve a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency of 0.78%, surpassing previously reported photocatalytic materials. This study establishes a molecular engineering approach to construct periodically arranged and spatially separated redox centers in single&#8208;component polymer photocatalysts, representing a hallmark to create more exciting polymer structures for photocatalysis moving forward.

         <title>Stabilization of Exposed Metal Nanocrystals in High&#8208;Temperature Heterogeneous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A partial oxide coating strategy is developed for the stabilization of exposed metal nanocrystals to enhance their performance in thermal reverse water gas shift (RWGS) catalysis particularly at high temperatures. This study opens a new avenue for the exploration of high&#8208;quality colloidal metal nanocrystals in high&#8208;temperature heterogeneous catalysis.








Abstract
Colloidal metal nanocrystals with uniform sizes, shapes, compositions, and architectures are ideal building blocks for constructing heterogeneous catalysts with well&#8208;defined characteristics toward the investigation of accurate structure&#8211;property relationships and better understanding of catalytic mechanism. However, their applications in high&#8208;temperature heterogeneous catalysis are often restricted by the difficulty in maintaining the high metal dispersity and easy accessibility to active sites under harsh operating conditions. Here, a partial&#8208;oxide&#8208;coating strategy is proposed to stabilize metal nanocrystals against sintering and meanwhile enable an effective exposure of active sites. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, controlled partial silica coating of colloidally prepared Pd0.82Ni0.18 nanocrystals with the size of 8 nm is demonstrated. This partially coated catalyst exhibits excellent activity, selectivity, and stability, outperforming its counterparts with fully coated and supported structures, in reverse water gas shift (RWGS) catalysis particularly at high operating temperatures. This study opens a new avenue for the exploration of colloidal metal nanocrystals in high&#8208;temperature heterogeneous catalysis.

As a proof-of-concept, controlled partial silica coating of colloidally prepared Pd&lt;sub&gt;0.82&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;0.18&lt;/sub&gt; nanocrystals with the size of 8 nm is demonstrated. This partially coated catalyst exhibits excellent activity, selectivity, and stability, outperforming its counterparts with fully coated and supported structures, in reverse water gas shift (RWGS) catalysis particularly at high operating temperatures. This study opens a new avenue for the exploration of colloidal metal nanocrystals in high-temperature heterogeneous catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Active and Passive Tuning of ultra&#8208;narrow Resonances in Polaritonic Nanoantennas</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Optical nanoantennas are of great importance for photonic devices and spectroscopy due to their capability to squeeze light at the nanoscale and enhance light&#8208;matter interactions. Among them, nanoantennas made of polar crystals supporting phonon polaritons (phononic nanoantennas) exhibit the highest quality factors. This is due to the low optical losses inherent in these materials, which, however, hinder the spectral tuning of the nanoantennas due to their dielectric nature. Here we realize active and passive tuning of ultra&#8208;narrow resonances in phononic nanoantennas over a wide spectral range (&#8764;35 cm&#8211;1, being the resonance linewidth &#8764;9 cm&#8211;1), monitored by near&#8208;field nanoscopy. To do that, we modify the local environment of a single nanoantenna made of hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) by placing it on different polar substrates, such as quartz (SiO2) and silicon carbide (4H&#8208;SiC), or covering it with layers of a high refractive&#8208;index van der Waals crystal (WSe2). Importantly, we demonstrate active tuning of the nanoantenna polaritonic resonances by placing it on top of a gated graphene monolayer in which we vary the Fermi energy. Our work presents the realization of tunable polaritonic nanoantennas with ultra&#8208;narrow resonances, which could find applications in active nanooptics and (bio)&#8208;sensing.

         <title>Enabling Anionic Redox Stability of P2&#8208;Na5/6Li1/4Mn3/4O2 by Mg Substitution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Oxygen&#8208;based anionic redox reactions have recently emerged as a lever to increase the capacity of Mn&#8208;rich layered oxide cathodes in addition to the charge compensation based on cationic redox reactions for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. Unfortunately, the irreversibility of anionic redox often aggravates irreversible structure change and poor cycling performance. Here, a stable anionic redox is achieved through substituting Na ions by Mg ions in P2&#8208;type Na0.83Li0.25Mn0.75O2. DFT calculations reveal that Mg substitution effectively decreases the oxygen chemical potential, causing an improvement in lattice oxygen stability. Moreover, at a highly desodiated state, Mg ions that remain in the lattice and interact with O 2p orbitals can decrease the undercoordinated oxygen and the non&#8208;bonded, electron&#8208;deficient O 2p states, facilitating the reversibility of oxygen redox. When cycled in the voltage range of 2.6&#8208;4.5&#160;V where only anionic redox is occurred for charge compensation, Na0.773Mg0.03Li0.25Mn0.75O2 presents a much better reversibility, giving a 4 times better cycle stability than that of Na0.83Li0.25Mn0.75O2. Experimentally, Na0.773Mg0.03Li0.25Mn0.75O2 exhibits a &#8764;1.1% volume expansion during sodium insertion/extraction, suggestive of a &#8220;zero&#8208;strain&#8221; cathode. Overall, our work opens a new avenue for enhancing anionic reversibility of oxygen&#8208;related Mn&#8208;rich cathodes.

         <title>KTaO3 &#8211; The New Kid on the Spintronics Block</title>

Abstract
Long after the heady days of high&#8208;temperature superconductivity, the oxides came back into the limelight in 2004 with the discovery of the two&#8208;dimensional electron gas in SrTiO3 and several heterostructures based on it. Not only do these materials exhibit interesting physics, they have opened up new vistas in oxide electronics and spintronics. However, much of the attention has recently shifted to KTaO3, a material with all the &#8220;good&#8221; properties of SrTiO3 (simple cubic structure, high mobility, etc.) but with the additional advantage of a much larger spin&#8208;orbit coupling. In this state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art review of the fascinating world of KTaO3, we attempt to cover the remarkable progress made, particularly in the last five years. We also indicate certain unsolved issues, while suggesting future research directions as well as potential applications. The range of physical phenomena associated with the two&#8208;dimensional electron gas trapped at the interfaces of KTaO3&#8208;based heterostructures include spin polarization, superconductivity, quantum oscillations in the magnetoresistance, spin&#8208;polarized electron transport, persistent photocurrent, Rashba effect, topological Hall effect, and inverse Edelstein Effect. We aim to discuss, on a single platform, the various fabrication techniques, the exciting physical properties and future application possibilities of this family of materials.

         <title>Reconfiguring Colors of Single Relief Structures by Directional Stretching</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Relief structures in an elastomer that exhibit reconfigurable colors from individual micro&#8208;/nanostructures are designed and experimentally demonstrated. Distinct from Bragg diffraction effects from periodic structures, individual trench segments can act as a single color pixel with high resolution. Multiple sets of colorful microprints are accessible from monolithic reliefs by directional strains and capillary effects.








Abstract
Color changes can be achieved by straining photonic crystals or gratings embedded in stretchable materials. However, the multiple repeat units and the need for a volumetric assembly of nanostructures limit the density of information content. Inspired by surface reliefs on oracle bones and music records as a means of information archival, here, surface&#8208;relief elastomers are endowed with multiple sets of information that are accessible by mechanical straining along in&#8208;plane axes. Distinct from Bragg diffraction effects from periodic structures, trenches that generate color due to variations in trench depth, enabling individual trench segments to support a single color, are reported. Using 3D printed cuboids, trenches of varying geometric parameters are replicated in elastomers. These parameters determine the initial color (or lack thereof), the response to capillary forces, and the appearance when strained along or across the trenches. Strain induces modulation in trench depth or the opening and closure of a trench, resulting in surface reliefs with up to six distinct states, and an initially featureless surface that reveals two distinct images when stretched along different axes. The highly reversible structural colors are promising in optical data archival, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and strain&#8208;sensing applications.

         <title>Organic&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid Cathode with Dual Energy&#8208;Storage Mechanism for Ultrahigh&#8208;Rate and Ultralong&#8208;Life Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual energy&#8208;storage mechanism is detected in an organic (ethylenediamine (EDA))&#8211;inorganic (vanadium oxide) hybrid cathode. Both the EDA ligand and the V&#8211;O layer can participate in Zn&#8208;ion storage synchronously. Benefiting from the advanced mechanism, this hybrid provides a high specific capacity, elevated voltage, and excellent long&#8208;term cycle stability.








Abstract
The exploitation of cathode materials with high capacity as well as high operating voltage is extremely important for the development of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs). Yet, the classical high&#8208;capacity materials (e.g., vanadium&#8208;based materials) provide a low discharge voltage, while organic cathodes with high operating voltage generally suffer from a low capacity. In this work, organic (ethylenediamine)&#8211;inorganic (vanadium oxide) hybrid cathodes, that is, EDA&#8208;VO, with a dual energy&#8208;storage mechanism, are designed for ultrahigh&#8208;rate and ultralong&#8208;life ZIBs. The embedded ethylenediamine (EDA) can not only increase the layer spacing of the vanadium oxide, with improved mobility of Zn ions in the V&#8211;O layered structure, but also act as a bidentate chelating ligand participating in the storage of Zn ions. This hybrid provides a high specific capacity (382.6&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 0.5 A g&#8722;1), elevated voltage (0.82&#160;V) and excellent long&#8208;term cycle stability (over 10&#160;000 cycles at 5 A g&#8722;1). Assistant density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate the cathode has remarkable electronic conductivity, with an ultralow diffusion barrier of 0.78&#160;eV for an optimal Zn&#8208;ion diffusion path in the EDA&#8208;VO.

     alt="Organic&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid Cathode with Dual Energy-Storage Mechanism for Ultrahigh-Rate and Ultralong-Life Aqueous Zinc-Ion Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A dual energy-storage mechanism is detected in an organic (ethylenediamine (EDA))&#8211;inorganic (vanadium oxide) hybrid cathode. Both the EDA ligand and the V&#8211;O layer can participate in Zn-ion storage synchronously. Benefiting from the advanced mechanism, this hybrid provides a high specific capacity, elevated voltage, and excellent long-term cycle stability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exploitation of cathode materials with high capacity as well as high operating voltage is extremely important for the development of aqueous zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs). Yet, the classical high-capacity materials (e.g., vanadium-based materials) provide a low discharge voltage, while organic cathodes with high operating voltage generally suffer from a low capacity. In this work, organic (ethylenediamine)&#8211;inorganic (vanadium oxide) hybrid cathodes, that is, EDA-VO, with a dual energy-storage mechanism, are designed for ultrahigh-rate and ultralong-life ZIBs. The embedded ethylenediamine (EDA) can not only increase the layer spacing of the vanadium oxide, with improved mobility of Zn ions in the V&#8211;O layered structure, but also act as a bidentate chelating ligand participating in the storage of Zn ions. This hybrid provides a high specific capacity (382.6&#160;mA h g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.5 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), elevated voltage (0.82&#160;V) and excellent long-term cycle stability (over 10&#160;000 cycles at 5 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). Assistant density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate the cathode has remarkable electronic conductivity, with an ultralow diffusion barrier of 0.78&#160;eV for an optimal Zn-ion diffusion path in the EDA-VO. This interesting idea of building organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid cathode materials with a dual energy-storage mechanism opens a new research direction toward high-energy secondary batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Two&#8208;Photon 3D Laser Printing Inside Synthetic Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;photon 3D laser printing inside of giant unilamellar lipid vesicles is reported. 2D and 3D hydrogel architectures with high precision and nearly arbitrary shape, including transmembrane pores, are realized within the confinement of a synthetic cell.








Abstract
Toward the ambitious goal of manufacturing synthetic cells from the bottom up, various cellular components have already been reconstituted inside lipid vesicles. However, the deterministic positioning of these components inside the compartment has remained elusive. Here, by using two&#8208;photon 3D&#160;laser printing, 2D and 3D hydrogel architectures are manufactured with high precision and nearly arbitrary shape inside preformed giant unilamellar lipid vesicles (GUVs). The required water&#8208;soluble photoresist is brought into the GUVs by diffusion in a single mixing step. Crucially, femtosecond two&#8208;photon printing inside the compartment does not destroy the GUVs. Beyond this proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle demonstration, early functional architectures are realized. In particular, a transmembrane structure acting as a pore is 3D&#160;printed, thereby allowing for the transport of biological cargo, including DNA, into the synthetic compartment. These experiments show that two&#8208;photon 3D laser microprinting can be an important addition to the existing toolbox of synthetic&#160;biology.

         <title>NIR&#8208;Responsive TiO2 Biometasurfaces: Toward In Situ Photodynamic Antibacterial Therapy for Biomedical Implants</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metasurface is constructed on a Ti alloy by a newly invented alkaline&#8211;acid bidirectional hydrothermal (aaBH) strategy, which manipulates the light&#8211;matter interaction and induces the strong adsorption of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light. The aaBH&#8208;treated Ti alloy implants show potent NIR&#8208;responsive antibacterial activity and possess a strong ability to promote the anchorage of human gingival fibroblasts on their surface.








Abstract
Implant&#8208;related microbial infection is a challenging clinical problem, and its treatment requires efficient eradication of the biofilm from the implant surface. Near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;responsive strategies are proposed as an emerging efficient antibacterial therapy. However, the utilization of photosensitizers or photocatalytic/photothermal nanomaterials in the available approach likely induces high potential risks of interfacial deterioration and biosafety compromise. Herein, a TiO2/TiO2&#8722;x metasurface with potent NIR&#8208;responsive antibacterial activity is produced on a Ti alloy implant by a newly invented topochemical conversion&#8208;based alkaline&#8211;acid bidirectional hydrothermal method (aaBH). Electromagnetic simulations prove that NIR absorption and near&#8208;field distribution of the metasurface can be tuned by the dimension and arrangement of the nanostructural unit. Promising antibacterial efficacy is proved by both in vitro and in vivo tests, with low&#8208;power NIR irradiation for 10 min. Besides, the designed nanostructure in the metasurface itself also shows excellence in enhancing the adhesion&#8208;related gene expression of human gingival fibroblasts that are exposed to 10 min of NIR irradiation, proving the potent nanostructure&#8208;induced biological effects. This work provides a biosafe and upscalable metasurfacing approach with extraordinary capacity of manipulating light adsorption, photocatalysis, and biological properties.

         <title>Anomalous Superconducting Proximity Effect in Bi2Se3/FeSe0.5Te0.5 Thin&#8208;Film Heterojunctions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anomalous superconducting proximity effect (SPE) is unveiled in topological insulator (TI)/superconductor Bi2Se3/FeSe0.5Te0.5 heterostructures. In contrast with the normal SPE that decays with thickness, such an effect occurs in momentum space regardless of the TI film thickness, as long as the topologically protected surface states are robust and form a continuous conduction loop.








Abstract
The superconducting proximity effect (SPE) induces a superconductivity transition in otherwise non&#8208;superconducting thin films in proximity with a superconductor. The SPE usually occurs in real space and decays exponentially with film thickness. Herein, an abnormal SPE in a topological insulator (TI)/superconductor heterostructure is unveiled, which is attributed to the topologically protected surface state. Surprisingly, such abnormal SPE occurs in momentum space regardless of the TI film thickness, as long as the topological surface states are robust and form a continuous conduction loop. Combining transport measurements and scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy techniques, the SPE in Bi2Se3/FeSe0.5Te0.5 heterostructures is explored, where Bi2Se3 is an ideal 3D topological insulator and FeSe0.5Te0.5 a typical iron&#8208;based superconductor. As the thickness of the Bi2Se3 thin film exceeds 400 nm, there still exists SPE&#8208;induced superconductivity on the surface of Bi2Se3 thin film with a transition temperature Tc not less than 10 K. Such an extraordinary behavior is induced by the unique properties of topologically protected surface states of Bi2Se3. This research deepens the understanding of the important role of topologically protected surface states in the SPE.

         <title>Paper without a Trail: Time&#8208;Dependent Encryption using Pillar[5]arene&#8208;Based Host&#8211;Guest Invisible Ink</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;erasing ink that can display information on time scales based on the incorporated photochromic spiropyran and host&#8211;guest crosslinkers is reported. Upon the addition of a competitive host or guest, disassembly of the crosslinks occurs. This reduces the extent of merocyanine aggregation and accelerates the decay periods that control the information displayed at various time points.








Abstract
A stimuli&#8208;responsive invisible ink for time&#8208;dependent encryption of information is reported. Consisting of a pillar[5]arene&#8208;based supramolecular network grafted with spiropyran moieties, these materials display time&#8208;dependent photochromic behavior with tailorable fading rates. Ultraviolet (UV) light results in isomerization of the colorless spiropyran to the corresponding colored merocyanine, while visible light or heat causes the reverse isomerization with a rate that is dependent on the density of host&#8211;guest crosslinks. The kinetics of discoloration are a function of merocyanine aggregation, which becomes more pronounced as the host&#8211;guest crosslink density is increased, leading to a reduced conversion rate and slower time&#8208;dependent fading. The degree of crosslinking, and hence the fading rate, may be modulated via the addition of unbound pillar[5]arene host or nitrile guest as competitors. Time&#8208;dependent information encryption is enabled by combining selective placement of host and guest competitors and UV patterning. UV patterning provides an initially &#8220;false&#8221; image that does not reveal the desired information, and it is only after a given time that the encrypted data appears. This work provides a unique approach to enhance the security of information storage associated with offline portable data encryption.

         <title>Perovskite&#8208;Type SrVO3 as High&#8208;Performance Anode Materials for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite SrVO3 is investigated as a Li&#8208;ion battery anode material. Thanks to the high intrinsic electronic and ionic conductivities, commercial thick and conducting additive&#8208;free perovskite SrVO3 electrodes are constructed and electrochemical performance with high gravimetric/areal/volumetric capacities, high&#8208;rate capability, and high cycling stability is delivered.








Abstract
Perovskite&#8208;type oxides, characterized by excellent multifunctional physical and chemical properties, are widely used in ferroelectric, piezoelectric, energy conversion, and storage applications. It is shown here that the perovskite&#8208;type SrVO3 can achieve excellent electrochemical performance as lithium&#8208;ion battery anodes thanks to its high electrically and ionically conductivity. Conducting additive&#8208;free SrVO3 electrodes can deliver a high specific capacity of 324 mAh g&#8722;1 at a safe and low average working potential of &#8776;0.9 V vs Li/Li+ together with excellent high&#8208;rate performance. A high areal capacity of &#8776;5.4 mAh cm&#8722;2 is obtained using an ultrathick (&#8776;120 &#956;m) electrode. Moreover, the fully lithiated SrVO3 electrode exhibits only 2.3% volume expansion that is explained by a simple solid&#8208;solution Li+&#8208;storage mechanism, resulting in good cycling stability of the electrode. This study highlights the perovskite&#8208;type SrVO3 as a promising Li+&#8208;storage anode and provides opportunities for exploring a variety of perovskite oxides as next&#8208;generation metal&#8208;ion battery anodes.

         <title>Biomimetic Trachea Engineering via a Modular Ring Strategy Based on Bone&#8208;Marrow Stem Cells and Atelocollagen for Use in Extensive Tracheal Reconstruction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chondroitin&#8208;sulfate&#8208;incorporating type&#8208;II atelocollagen scaffold repopulated with bone marrow stem cells for cartilaginous rings regeneration and type&#8208;I atelocollagen scaffold for vascularized fibrous tissue formation is fabricated; then, a modular ring strategy to develop a biomimetic trachea with cartilaginous rings alternately interspersed between the vascularized fibrous tissue architecture is adopted. The biomimetic trachea is used for extensive tracheal reconstruction.








Abstract
The fabrication of biomimetic tracheas with a architecture of cartilaginous rings alternately interspersed between vascularized fibrous tissue (CRVFT) has the potential to perfectly recapitulate the normal tracheal structure and function. Herein, the development of a customized chondroitin&#8208;sulfate&#8208;incorporating type&#8208;II atelocollagen (COL II/CS) scaffold with excellent chondrogenic capacity and a type&#8208;I atelocollagen (COL I) scaffold to facilitate the formation of vascularized fibrous tissue is described. An efficient modular ring strategy is then adopted to develop a CRVFT&#8208;based biomimetic trachea. The in vitro engineering of cartilaginous rings is achieved via the recellularization of ring&#8208;shaped COL II/CS scaffolds using bone marrow stem cells as a mimetic for native cartilaginous ring tissue. A CRVFT&#8208;based trachea with biomimetic mechanical properties, composed of bionic biochemical components, is additionally successfully generated in vivo via the alternating stacking of cartilaginous rings and ring&#8208;shaped COL I scaffolds on a silicone pipe. The resultant biomimetic trachea with pedicled muscular flaps is used for extensive tracheal reconstruction and exhibits satisfactory therapeutic outcomes with structural and functional properties similar to those of native trachea. This is the first study to utilize stem cells for long&#8208;segmental tracheal cartilaginous regeneration and this represents a promising method for extensive tracheal reconstruction.

         <title>Elaborate Size&#8208;Tuning of Silica Aerogel Building Blocks Enables Laser&#8208;Driven Lighting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silica aerogels with accurate building&#8208;block control are realized by adjusting the surfactant concentration during the synthesis process. The resulting silica aerogels, serving as a diffuser, show an incredibly promising application in laser&#8208;driven lighting.








Abstract
Silica aerogels with accurate building&#8208;block control are realized by adjusting the surfactant concentration during the synthesis process. The resulting silica&#8208;aerogel monolith with spherical building blocks of &#8776;24&#8211;40&#160;nm, together with a deliberately created hole along the incident light direction, shows an incredibly promising application in monochromatic laser&#8208;driven lighting. The resulting coefficient of illuminance variation is as low as 8.1%, significantly outperforming commercially available ground&#8208;glass diffusers (139.0%) and polymer diffusers (249.1%); the speckle contrast is lower, as well as better, than that can be recognized by the human eye (4%), and the illuminance uniformity in the range of 0.770&#8211;0.862 is much better (higher) than that indoor workplace lighting required by the International Organization for Standardization. Lighting with any color in the visible spectrum, including white, can be obtained by using three primary color lasers (450, 532, and 638&#160;nm) with different powers simultaneously as the light source. The resulting silica aerogel, which has excellent thermal stability, high laser&#8208;damage threshold, outstanding mechanical performance, and superhydrophobicity, can be further applied to long&#8208;distance and noncontact laser&#8208;driven lighting in rain or underwater without any additional encapsulation components.

         <title>Sodium&#8208;Doped Titania Self&#8208;Rectifying Memristors for Crossbar Array Neuromorphic Architectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Na&#8208;doped TiO2&#160;memristor is fabricated using in&#160;situ doping with a custom&#8208;designed NaOH reactant during atomic layer deposition growth, where the resulting resistive&#8208;switching mechanism is based on Na migration. By applying these self&#8208;rectifying Na&#8208;doped TiO2&#160;memristors to a 6&#160;&#215;&#160;6&#160;crossbar array, each of the 36&#160;devices are operated individually without crosstalk disturbance.








Abstract
Memristors integrated into a crossbar&#8208;array architecture (CAA) are promising candidates for nonvolatile memory elements in artificial neural networks. However, the relatively low reliability of memristors coupled with crosstalk and sneak currents in CAAs have limited the realization of the full potential of this technology. Here, high&#8208;reliability Na&#8208;doped TiO2&#160;memristors grown in&#160;situ by atomic layer deposition (ALD) are demonstrated, where reversible Na migration underlies the resistive&#8208;switching mechanism. By employing ALD growth with an aqueous NaOH reactant in deionized water, uniform implantation of Na dopants is achieved in the crystallized TiO2&#160;thin films at 250&#160;&#176;C without post&#8208;annealing. The resulting Na&#8208;doped TiO2&#160;memristors show electroforming&#8208;free and self&#8208;rectifying resistive&#8208;switching behavior, and they are ideally suited for selectorless CAAs. Effective addressing of selectorless nodes is demonstrated via electrical measurement of individual memristors in a 6&#160;&#215;&#160;6&#160;crossbar using a read current of less than 1&#160;&#181;A with negligible sneak current at or below the noise level of &#8776;100&#160;pA. Finally, the long&#8208;term potentiation and depression synaptic behavior from these Na&#8208;doped TiO2&#160;memristors achieves greater than 99.1% accuracy for image&#8208;recognition tasks using a convolutional neural network based on the selectorless of crossbar arrays.

Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are immobilized in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) by a general strategy with SnO2 as a mediator onto metal&#8211;oxo clusters via a two&#8208;step microwave&#8208;assisted modification approach. Remarkably, the H2 production efficiency of Pt1/SnO2/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 under visible light surpasses that of Cu1/SnO2/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 and Ni1/SnO2/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, surpassing that of their corresponding metal nanoparticles (NPs) by far.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are witnessing rapid development due to their high activity and selectivity toward diverse reactions. However, it remains a grand challenge in the general synthesis of SACs, particularly featuring an identical chemical microenvironment and on the same support. Herein, a universal synthetic protocol is developed to immobilize SACs in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). Significantly, by means of SnO2 as a mediator or adaptor, not only different single&#8208;atom metal sites, such as Pt, Cu, and Ni, etc., can be installed, but also the MOF supports can be changed (for example, UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, PCN&#8208;222, and DUT&#8208;67) to afford M1/SnO2/MOF architecture. Taking UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 as a representative, the Pt1/SnO2/MOF exhibits approximately five times higher activity toward photocatalytic H2 production than the corresponding Pt nanoparticles (&#8776;2.5&#160;nm) stabilized by SnO2/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2. Remarkably, despite featuring identical parameters in the chemical microenvironment and support in M1/SnO2/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, the Pt1 catalyst possesses a hydrogen evolution rate of 2167 &#181;mol g&#8211;1 h&#8211;1, superior to the Cu1 and Ni1 counterparts, which is attributed to the differentiated hydrogen binding free energies, as supported by density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations. This is thought to be the first report on a universal approach toward the stabilization of SACs with identical chemical microenvironment on an identical support.

         <title>Strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; Stacking Stabilized Nanophotosensitizers: Improving Tumor Retention for Enhanced Therapy for Large Tumors in Mice</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoparticles encapsulating BODIPY photosensitizers with strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking are prepared, demonstrating long tumor retention of up to 10 days. The nanoparticles can completely suppress regular test size tumors (100 mm3) in mice by one&#8208;time radiation. Importantly, the nanoparticles also allow treatment of large&#8208;size tumors (350 mm3) via single&#8208;dose injection and three&#8208;time light treatments, resulting in a 90% inhibition rate.








Abstract
Conventional photosensitizers (PSs) often show poor tumor retention and are rapidly cleared from the bloodstream, which is one of the key hindrances to guarantee precise and efficient photodynamic therapy (PDT) in vivo. In this work, a photosensitizer assembly nanosystem that sharply enhances tumor retention up to &#8776;10 days is present. The PSs are synthesized by meso&#8208;substituting anthracene onto a BODIPY scaffold (AN&#8208;BDP), which then self&#8208;assembles into stable nanoparticles (AN&#8208;BDP NPs) with amphiphilic block copolymers due to the strong intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction of the anthracene. Additionally, the incorporated anthracene excites the PSs, producing singlet oxygen under red&#8208;light irradiation. Although AN&#8208;BDP NPs can completely suppress regular test size tumors (&#8776;100 mm3) by one&#8208;time radiation, only 12% tumor growth inhibition rate is observed in the case of large&#8208;size tumors (&#8776;350 mm3) under the same conditions. Due to the long&#8208;time tumor retention, AN&#8208;BDP NPs allow single&#8208;dose injection and three&#8208;time light treatments, resulting in an inhibition rate over 90%, much more efficient than single&#8208;time radiation of conventional clinically used PSs including chlorin&#8208;e6 (Ce6) and porphyrin with poor tumor retention. The results reveal the importance of long tumor retention time of PSs for efficient PDT, which can accelerate the clinical development of nanophotosensitizers.

         <title>Controlling and Focusing In&#8208;Plane Hyperbolic Phonon Polaritons in &#945;&#8208;MoO3 with a Curved Plasmonic Antenna</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Launching, controlling, and focusing in&#8208;plane hyperbolic phonon polaritons in van der Waals &#945;&#8208;MoO3 are realized with geometrically designed curved gold plasmonic antennas. By engineering the curvature of the antenna extremity, it is able to tune the focal lengths and lateral sizes of the focal points. This study can open up new avenues for planar nanophotonic devices in the mid&#8208;IR region.








Abstract
Hyperbolic phonon polaritons (HPhPs) sustained in polar van der Waals (vdW) crystals exhibit extraordinary confinement of long&#8208;wave electromagnetic fields to the deep subwavelength scale. In stark contrast to uniaxial vdW hyperbolic materials, recently emerged biaxial hyperbolic materials, such as &#945;&#8208;MoO3 and &#945;&#8208;V2O5, offer new degrees of freedom for controlling light in two&#8208;dimensions due to their distinctive in&#8208;plane hyperbolic dispersions. However, the control and focusing of these in&#8208;plane HPhPs remain elusive. Here, a versatile technique is proposed for launching, controlling, and focusing in&#8208;plane HPhPs in &#945;&#8208;MoO3 with geometrically designed curved gold plasmonic antennas. It is found that the subwavelength manipulation and focusing behaviors are strongly dependent on the curvature of the antenna extremity. This strategy operates effectively in a broadband spectral region. These findings not only provide fundamental insights into the manipulation of light by biaxial hyperbolic crystals at the nanoscale but also open up new opportunities for planar nanophotonic applications.

Abstract
Enzyme immobilization in the confines of microfluidic chips, that promote enzyme activity and stability, has become a powerful strategy to enhance biocatalysis and biomass conversion. Here, based on a newly developed all&#8208;liquid microfluidic chip, fabricated by the interfacial assembly of nanoparticle surfactants (NPSs) in a biphasic system, a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly strategy to generate polysaccharide multilayers on the surface of a microchannel, greatly enhancing the mechanical properties of the microchannel and offering a biocompatible microenvironment for enzyme immobilization, is presented. Using horseradish peroxidase and glucose oxidase as model enzymes, all&#8208;liquid microfluidic enzymatic and cascade reactors have been constructed and the crucial role of polysaccharide multilayers on enhancing the enzyme loading and catalytic efficiency is demonstrated.

         <title>Polyprodrug Nanomedicines: An Emerging Paradigm for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyprodrug nanomedicines have great potential in cancer therapy owing to their well&#8208;controlled composition and high drug loading by direct polymerization of therapeutic monomers. Recent advances in the development of polyprodrug nanomedicines are summarized to provide deep insights into the design and preparation of polyprodrug nanomedicines for efficient cancer therapy.








Abstract
Nanomedicines have the potential to provide advanced therapeutic strategies in combating tumors. Polymer&#8208;prodrug&#8208;based nanomedicines are particularly attractive in cancer therapies owing to the maximum drug loading, prolonged blood circulation, and reduced premature leakage and side effects in comparison with conventional nanomaterials. However, the difficulty in precisely tuning the composition and drug loading of polymer&#8211;drug conjugates leads to batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch variations of the prodrugs, thus significantly restricting their clinical translation. Polyprodrug nanomedicines inherit the numerous intrinsic advantages of polymer&#8211;drug conjugates and exhibit well&#8208;controlled composition and drug loading via direct polymerization of therapeutic monomers, representing a promising nanomedicine for clinical tumor therapies. In this review, recent advances in the development of polyprodrug nanomedicines are summarized for tumor elimination.

     alt="Polyprodrug Nanomedicines: An Emerging Paradigm for Cancer Therapy"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polyprodrug nanomedicines have great potential in cancer therapy owing to their well-controlled composition and high drug loading by direct polymerization of therapeutic monomers. Recent advances in the development of polyprodrug nanomedicines are summarized to provide deep insights into the design and preparation of polyprodrug nanomedicines for efficient cancer therapy.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nanomedicines have the potential to provide advanced therapeutic strategies in combating tumors. Polymer-prodrug-based nanomedicines are particularly attractive in cancer therapies owing to the maximum drug loading, prolonged blood circulation, and reduced premature leakage and side effects in comparison with conventional nanomaterials. However, the difficulty in precisely tuning the composition and drug loading of polymer&#8211;drug conjugates leads to batch-to-batch variations of the prodrugs, thus significantly restricting their clinical translation. Polyprodrug nanomedicines inherit the numerous intrinsic advantages of polymer&#8211;drug conjugates and exhibit well-controlled composition and drug loading via direct polymerization of therapeutic monomers, representing a promising nanomedicine for clinical tumor therapies. In this review, recent advances in the development of polyprodrug nanomedicines are summarized for tumor elimination. Various types of polyprodrug nanomedicines and the corresponding properties are first summarized. The unique advantages of polyprodrug nanomedicines and their key roles in various tumor therapies are further highlighted. Finally, current challenges and the perspectives on future research of polyprodrug nanomedicines are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Defect&#8208;Free Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Membrane for Precise Ion/Solvent Separation toward Highly Stable Magnesium Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase enabled by an intact metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) membrane is constructed directly on Mg foils. Through precious solvent molecule/Mg ion sieve owing to the angstrom&#8208;sized aperture window, the MOF membrane suppresses the solvent reduction and enables a low migration barrier for Mg2+ transportation within this MOF&#8208;based solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase.








Abstract
Metallic magnesium batteries are promising candidates beyond lithium&#8208;ion batteries; however, a passive interfacial layer because of the electro&#8208;reduction of solvents on Mg surfaces usually leads to ultrahigh overpotential for the reversible Mg chemistry. Inspired by the excellent separation effect of permselective metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) at angstrom scale, a large&#8208;area and defect&#8208;free MOF membrane directly on Mg surfaces is here constructed. In this process, the electrochemical deprotonation of ligand can be facilitated to afford the self&#8208;correcting of intercrystalline voids until a seamless membrane formed, which can eliminate nonselective intercrystalline diffusion of electrolyte and realize selective Mg2+ transport but precisely separate the solvent molecules from the MOF channels. Compared with the continuous solvent reduction on bare Mg anode, the as&#8208;constructed MOF membrane is demonstrated to significantly stabilize the Mg electrode via suppressing the permeation of solvents, hence contributing to a low&#8208;overpotential plating/stripping in conventional electrolytes. The concept is demonstrated that membrane separation can serve as solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase, which would be widely applicable to other energy&#8208;storage systems.

         <title>Resolving Atomic&#8208;Scale Interactions in Nonfullerene Acceptor Organic Solar Cells with Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy, Crystallographic Modelling, and Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combined results from solid&#8208;state NMR, crystallography, and modelling techniques highlight key differences in the Y6 morphology in PM6:Y6 blends cast from different solvents, which lead to different power conversion efficiencies in solar cells. By interpreting the experimental data step&#8208;by&#8208;step and using the results from each step, a more complete understanding of the underlying fundamental processes is reached.








Abstract
Fused&#8208;ring core nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs), designated &#8220;Y&#8208;series,&#8221; have enabled high&#8208;performance organic solar cells (OSCs) achieving over 18% power conversion efficiency (PCE). Since the introduction of these NFAs, much effort has been expended to understand the reasons for their exceptional performance. While several studies have identified key optoelectronic properties that govern high PCEs, little is known about the molecular level origins of large variations in performance, spanning from 5% to 18% PCE, for example, in the case of PM6:Y6 OSCs. Here, a combined solid&#8208;state NMR, crystallography, and molecular modeling approach to elucidate the atomic&#8208;scale interactions in Y6 crystals, thin films, and PM6:Y6 bulk heterojunction (BHJ) blends is introduced. It is shown that the Y6 morphologies in BHJ blends are not governed by the morphology in neat films or single crystals. Notably, PM6:Y6 blends processed from different solvents self&#8208;assemble into different structures and morphologies, whereby the relative orientations of the sidechains and end groups of the Y6 molecules to their fused&#8208;ring cores play a crucial role in determining the resulting morphology and overall performance of the solar cells. The molecular&#8208;level understanding of BHJs enabled by this approach will guide the engineering of next&#8208;generation NFAs for stable and efficient OSCs.

         <title>Mechanochemistry Advances High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanochemical route to prepare stoichiometric&#8208;pure and air&#8208;stable &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3 powders is developed, which can be stored for more than 10 months in ambient environment. Redissolving the &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3 powders can generate a high concentration of large&#8208;sized polyiodide colloids, which can serve as nuclei to promote heterogeneous nucleation for perovskite films. As a result, a competitive solar cell efficiency of 24.22% is achieved.








Abstract
A prerequisite for commercializing perovskite photovoltaics is to develop a swift and eco&#8208;friendly synthesis route, which guarantees the mass production of halide perovskites in the industry. Herein, a green&#8208;solvent&#8208;assisted mechanochemical strategy is developed for fast synthesizing a stoichiometric &#948;&#8208;phase formamidinium lead iodide (&#948;&#8208;FAPbI3) powder, which serves as a high&#8208;purity precursor for perovskite film deposition with low defects. The presynthesized &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3 precursor possesses high concentration of micrometer&#8208;sized colloids, which are in favor of preferable crystallization by spontaneous nucleation. The resultant perovskite films own preferred crystal orientations of cubic (100) plane, which is beneficial for superior carrier transport compared to that of the films with isotropic crystal orientations using &#8220;mixture of PbI2 and FAI&#8221; as precursors. As a result, high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells with a maximum power conversion efficiency of 24.2% are obtained. Moreover, the &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3 powder shows superior storage stability for more than 10 months in ambient environment (40&#160;&#177; 10% relative humidity), being conducive to a facile and practical storage for further commercialization.
