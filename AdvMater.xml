         <title>Reinforced Perovskite&#8208;Substrate Interfaces via Multi&#8208;Sited and Dual&#8208;Sided Anchoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The perovskite&#8208;substrate interfaces are reinforced by using a dual&#8208;sided anchoring polymeric hole transporter, which enables significantly enhanced interfacial adhesion and defect passivation. The resulting inverted structured perovskite solar cells achieve 26.8% efficiency with excellent operational stability at 85&#160;&#176;C. This work demonstrates the critical role of interfacial stabilization for high&#8208;performance and stable perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Interfacial reliability is critical for the long&#8208;term stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), yet the perovskite&#8208;substrate interface represents the most vulnerable part in high&#8208;efficiency devices. Here, this interface, by incorporating a dual&#8208;sided anchoring polymeric hole&#8208;transporting interlayer is reinforced with abundant coordinating pyridyl units as side chains, which induces strong adhesion between the perovskite and substrate by forming multidimensional interactions with adjacent layers. This simultaneously enhances the mechanical strength through effective distribution and dissipation of mechanical stress and the electronic quality of the perovskite&#8208;substrate interface through defect passivation. The resulting PSCs exhibit a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.8% (certified at 26.6%). With a more robust perovskite composition, devices maintain 98% of their initial PCE of &#8776;26% after maximum&#8208;power&#8208;point tracking at 85&#160;&#176;C for 1500&#160;h. These devices exhibit excellent fatigue resistance under thermal cycling (&#8208;40 to 85&#160;&#176;C), retaining 93% efficiency after undergoing 900 cycles.

Topology fortified anode (TFA) materials, featuring a 3D lithiophilic Li5B4 skeleton combined with an ingeniously optimized fraction of electroactive lithium phase, along with broadened external pressure tolerance to enhance the electrochemical performance of ASSLBs. The TFA materials exhibit robust mechanical stability and fast lithium diffusivity, achieving near&#8208;zero volume changes along with a fivefold improvement in external pressure tolerance compared to Li&#176;.








Abstract
Despite its high theoretical capacity and the lowest electrode potential, the lithium metal (Li&#176;) anode possesses significant volume changes and narrow external pressure tolerance upon cycling, hindering its commercial applications in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs). Herein, the concept of topology fortified anode (TFA) materials is introduced, featuring a 3D lithiophilic Li5B4 skeleton combined with an ingeniously optimized fraction of electroactive lithium phase, along with broadened external pressure tolerance to synergistically enhance the electrochemical performance of ASSLBs. The unique topological design of the TFA materials empowers them with robust mechanical stability and fast lithium diffusivity, achieving near&#8208;zero volume changes along with a fivefold improvement in external pressure tolerance compared to Li&#176;. An archetypal TFA&#8208;based symmetric cell demonstrates 3.6&#8208;fold higher critical current density than its Li&#176;&#8208;based counterpart, sustaining stable cycling for &gt;6,000&#160;h at 2 mAh cm&#8722;2. When paired with a high&#8208;capacity of FeS2 cathode, the archetypal TFA&#8208;based full cells achieve 62% active lithium utilization (9.5 mAh cm&#8722;2), and &#8776;70% capacity retention after 800 cycles at a high current density of 3.07 mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. The findings provide a revolutionary design approach for high&#8208;energy anodes in ASSLBs, advancing not only their development but also battery technologies beyond lithium chemistry.

         <title>Novel Sulfide&#8208;Chloride Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes with Tunable Anion Ratio for Highly Stable Solid&#8208;State Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A new family of Na&#8208;Zr&#8208;S&#8208;Cl sulfide&#8208;chloride Na SSEs with tailored anion compositions is explored. A high ionic conductivity is realized for both Cl&#8208;rich and Cl&#8208;deficient structures, attributed to the unique chloride bridging structure and low Na&#8208;ion migration barrier. The Cl&#8208;deficient structure demonstrates excellent stability for solid&#8208;state Na&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state Na batteries (SSNBs) are among the most promising next&#8208;generation energy storage devices due to their high energy density, enhanced safety, and cost&#8208;efficiency. Achieving high&#8208;performance SSNBs depends on the development of solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) with excellent ionic conductivity, wide electrochemical windows, and robust mechanical properties. Sulfide and halide&#8208;based Na SSEs have been widely studied in recent years with their respective strengths and limitations. Herein for the first time, a new family of Na&#8208;Zr&#8208;S&#8208;Cl sulfide&#8208;chloride Na SSEs with tailored anion compositions is explored. A high ionic conductivity of 4.89 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 is realized with a Cl&#8208;rich structure, attributed to the unique chloride bridging structure and low Na&#8208;ion migration barrier. Furthermore, by tuning the ratio between sulfur and chloride anions, two different unique structures are obtained with different surface morphology, thermal stability, mechanical properties, and electrochemical stability. The Cl&#8208;deficient structure of Na2S&#8208;1.3ZrCl4 SSEs demonstrates excellent stability for solid&#8208;state Na&#8208;ion batteries, maintaining a high reversible capacity of over 90 mAh g&#8722;1 after 600 cycles at 0.1 C. This study offers insights into the design of new Na SSEs, advancing the development of safer and high&#8208;performance SSNBs.

         <title>High&#8208;Spin Cobalt Enables Strong Metal&#8208;Sulfur Orbital Hybridization for Accelerated Polysulfide Conversion in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrocatalyst (HSCo/TiO2&#8208;x) for Li&#8208;S batteries is reported, featuring undercoordinated TiO2&#8208;x nanosheets anchoring high&#8208;spin Co atoms. The unpaired 3d electrons of Co promote orbital hybridization with polysulfides, enhancing conversion kinetics, suppressing shuttle effects, and improving cycling stability under practical conditions.








Abstract
The development of electrocatalysts to mitigate polysulfide shuttling and enhance the kinetics of sulfur species conversion is pivotal for the advancement of lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries. In this study, the fabrication of porous, undercoordinated titanium dioxide nanosheets adorned with high&#8208;spin state cobalt atoms (HSCo/TiO2&#8208;x) as efficient electrocatalysts is presented. The undercoordinated TiO2&#8208;x nanosheets provide a profusion of edge active sites conducive to Co atom attachment, firmly embedded within the lattice structure, thereby ensuring heightened structural stability throughout repetitive cycling processes. Furthermore, the high&#8208;spin state Co atoms contribute abundant unpaired electrons, occupying distinct 3d orbitals. This configuration facilitates electron transfer and orbital hybridization upon interaction with polysulfides, leading to suppressed shutting effect and enhanced polysulfide conversion kinetics. Consequently, the Li&#8208;S cell equipped with an HSCo/TiO2&#8208;x modified separator exhibits an impressive capacity of 8.05 mAh cm&#8722;2 under elevated sulfur loading of 10.9 mg cm&#8722;2. Additionally, the fabricated Li&#8208;S pouch cell delivers a substantial initial discharge capacity of 0.47 Ah with a high energy density of 379.3 Wh kg&#8722;1. This study serves as a valuable reference for exploring the intricate relationship between spin state regulation and electrochemical performance, and holds great promise for the design of highly efficient future electrocatalysts.

         <title>Deep&#8208;Blue Narrowband OLEDs Achieve External Quantum Efficiency Over 40% and Blue Index of 422 by Synergistic &#960;&#8208;Extension and Heavy&#8208;Atom Effect</title>

A &#960;&#8208;extended, heavy&#8208;atom design enables multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters with an ultrafast reverse intersystem crossing rate of 3.0 &#215; 106 s&#8722;1 while preserving narrowband emission in the deep&#8208;blue region. The best&#8208;performing device achieves an emission maximum at 456 nm, a full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 18 nm, a record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency of 40.5%, and a Blue Index of 422, charting a promising route toward next&#8208;generation deep&#8208;blue display technologies.








Abstract
Multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters hold great promise for high&#8208;resolution OLEDs, yet achieving both ultranarrow emission and efficient triplet utilization in the deep&#8208;blue region remains challenging. Here, a synergistic molecular design is reported that combines &#960;&#8208;extension and heavy&#8208;atom incorporation to effectively reconcile the trade&#8208;off between color purity and fast reverse intersystem crossing (RISC). In this approach, &#960;&#8208;extension narrows the emission bandwidth and reduces the singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap, while the strategic introduction of chalcogen atoms selectively enhances spin&#8211;orbit coupling with minimal impact on the emission spectrum. As a result, the new emitter exhibits a peak emission at 453&#160;nm with an exceptionally narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 17&#160;nm and a high RISC rate constant of 3.0 &#215; 106&#8201;s&#8722;1. When incorporated into a non&#8208;sensitized OLED, the emitter meets the European Broadcast Union (EBU) deep&#8208;blue standard with CIE coordinates as low as (0.140,&#8201;0.059), and sustains a brightness exceeding 30,000&#8201;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2. Notably, the device achieves a record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 40.5% with minimal roll&#8208;off&#8212;retaining 38.4% and 28.2% at 100 and 1,000&#160;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, respectively&#8212;and attains a Blue Index (BI) of 422&#160;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1&#8201;CIEy&#8722;1. These findings highlight the effectiveness of our tactic in overcoming prior limitations where heavy&#8208;atom doping often compromises color purity, paving the way for next&#8208;generation emitters in advanced display and lighting applications.

         <title>Observation of Nonlinear Topological Corner States Originating from Different Spectral Charges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of higher&#8208;order topological insulator with hybrid edges supporting zero&#8208;dimensional corner states originating from different spectral charges is reported. Different spectral charges are manifested in different internal structure and localization properties of topological states, as we demonstrate experimentally in fs&#8208;laser written waveguide arrays. Such topological states give rise to rich families of topological corner solitons at high powers.









Abstract
Higher&#8208;order topological insulators (HOTIs) are unique topological materials supporting edge states with the dimensionality at least by two lower than the dimensionality of the underlying structure. HOTIs are observed on lattices with different symmetries, but only in geometries, where truncation of HOTI produces a finite structure with the same order of discrete rotational symmetry as that of the unit cell, thereby setting the geometry of insulator edge. Here, a new type of 2D HOTI based on the Kekul&#233;&#8208;patterned lattice is experimentally demonstrated, whose order of discrete rotational symmetry differs from that of the unit cells of the constituent honeycomb lattice, with hybrid boundaries that help to produce all three possible corners that support effectively 0D corner states of topological origin, especially the one associated with spectral charge 5/6. It is also shown that linear corner states give rise to rich families of stable hybrid nonlinear corner states bifurcating from them in the presence of focusing nonlinearity of the material. Such new types of nonlinear corner states are observed in hybrid HOTI inscribed in transparent nonlinear dielectric using fs&#8208;laser writing technique. The results complete the class of HOTIs and open the way to observation of topological states with new internal structure and&#160;symmetry.

         <title>Uni&#8208;Axial Densification of Slurry&#8208;Casted Li&#8326;PS&#8325;Cl Tapes: The Role of Particle Size Distribution and Densification Pressure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;state batteries&#160;promise high energy density and safety for electric vehicles. This study examines the densification of slurry&#8208;casted Li&#8326;PS&#8325;Cl separator tapes, highlighting the role of particle size distribution&#160;and uni&#8208;axial pressure. Wet milling refines particles while preserving conductivity, and a critical compaction threshold leads to superior performance. Structural defects, however, impact cycling stability, underscoring processing optimization needs.









Abstract
Solid&#8208;state batteries&#160;are transformative solutions for electric vehicles, offering superior energy density and safety. Sulfide&#8208;based solid electrolytes&#160;like Li&#8326;PS&#8325;Cl (LPSCl) combine high ionic conductivity and mechanical adaptability, but challenges remain in scaling up high&#8208;performance separator tapes due to particle size distribution (PSD) and processing constraints. This study investigates the uni&#8208;axial densification of slurry&#8208;casted LPSCl tapes, focusing on PSD refinement and compaction pressure. Wet milling has been identified to effectively reduce PSD to submicron levels while preserving structural integrity and near&#8208;pristine conductivity. A critical pressure threshold (&#8776;350&#160;MPa) for tape&#8208;casted LPSCl slurries (2.5% hydrated poly(acrylonitrile&#8208;co&#8208;butadiene)) is identified, where ionic conductivity peaks due to particle fusion and the formation of conductive networks. However, open porosity (&#8776;30%), particularly along the densification direction, and surface irregularities persist. These structural issues have significant implications for battery performance. For example, surface roughness and interfacial voids lead to localized current focusing, with current densities exceeding applied values by over 20 times. Percolating porosity accelerates dendritic failure modes, undermining stability and limiting cycling rates. This work underscores the need for optimized powder processing and densification techniques to enhance scalability and performance, advancing LPSCl&#8208;based separators for the practical adoption of solid&#8208;state batteries&#160;in electric vehicles&#160;and other high&#8208;energy applications.

         <title>Site Specific In3&#8314;&#8208;Alloying Unlocks Intense Photoluminescence and High Stability in Antimony Halide Hybrids for WLED and Anticounterfeiting Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, an In3+ alloyed antimony halide hybrid (C4H12N2)5[(SbCl5)2(InCl6)Cl4] exhibiting high stability, large stokes shift, and near unity photoluminescence quantum yield is successfully prepared, which is an excellent yellow phosphor for applications such as WLED lighting and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.








Abstract
While metal doping strategies have proven effective in regulating the bandgap and enhancing the photophysical properties of hybrid metal halides, site&#8208;specific atom alloying by mixing metals of different elements offers a new route for material modification. Here an antimony halide hybrid material with the formula of (C&#8324;H&#8321;&#8322;N&#8322;)&#8325;[(SbCl&#8325;)&#8322;(SbCl&#8326;)Cl&#8324;] (Py&#8208;SbCl) is shown with crystallographically independent alternating square pyramidal [SbCl&#8325;] and octahedral [SbCl&#8326;] sites sandwiched by organic layers. Interestingly, the octahedral site of the [SbCl&#8326;] can be fully replaced by the In3+ ions, forming the alloyed compound (C&#8324;H&#8321;&#8322;N&#8322;)&#8325;[(SbCl&#8325;)&#8322;(InCl&#8326;)Cl&#8324;] (Py&#8208;SbInCl). More importantly, the latter shows a near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield of 97%, which is &#8776;7 times of enhancement compared to the pristine Py&#8208;SbCl compound. This is mainly due to the much&#8208;enhanced Young's modulus, higher radiative decay rates and longer electron transient rates, presumably stemming from shorter In&#9472;Cl bond distances and higher dipole moments, as revealed by a cocktail study of X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal crystallography, density functional theory, femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and so on. In addition, it is shown that Py&#8208;SbInCl is an excellent yellow phosphor that can be used for white light&#8208;emitting diodes and other applications such as counterfeiting. Therefore, making site&#8208;specific alloying compounds may open a new design approach for functional bimetallic hybrid materials.

         <title>Self&#8208;Trapped Excitons Activate Pseudo&#8208;Inert Basal Planes of 2D Organic Semiconductors for Improved Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D organic semiconductors are widely believed to have uniformly active surfaces. This study reveals that their basal planes can be pseudo&#8208;inert due to anisotropic exciton migration. By inducing exciton self&#8208;trapping through dimensional reduction, these inert planes are activated, boosting hydrogen peroxide production by over 350%. The work uncovers key structure&#8211;property relationships for advanced photocatalyst design.









Abstract
2D organic semiconductors are widely considered superior photocatalysts due to their large basal planes, which host abundant and tunable reaction sites. However, here, it is discovered that these basal planes can be pseudo&#8208;inert, fundamentally challenging conventional design strategies that assume uniform activity on the surface of 2D organic semiconductors. Using 2D potassium&#8208;poly (heptazine imide) (KPHI) for hydrogen peroxide photocatalysis as a model, it is demonstrated that the pseudo&#8208;inertness of basal planes stems from preferential exciton transport to edges, instead of interlayer transport in highly ordered structures. Thus, their dimension reduction enables controlled localization of exciton due to the self&#8208;trapping mechanism, whereby the basal planes can transform from pseudo&#8208;inert state into active catalytic sites. With this knowledge, a modified 2D KPHI capable of generating 35 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 of H2O2, which is over 350% increase compared to pristine KPHI, is reported. More interestingly, the activated basal planes promote H2O2 production through a reaction pathway distinct from that of pseudo&#8208;inert basal planes. These findings establish fundamental principles connecting crystal structure, exciton dynamics, and reactive site distribution, providing new insights into the design of high&#8208;performance photocatalysts.

         <title>Revealing the Degradation Mechanism of Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries for Electric Aircraft</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
LIBs used for aviation exhibit rapid aging and shortened service life due to the harsh conditions of aviation, posing significant risks to flight safety. This study reveals the degradation mechanisms and quantifies the relative impact of temperature and pressure factors, providing critical insights for optimizing future electric aircraft battery designs.








Abstract
The widespread adoption of electric vehicles has spurred the exploration of airworthy lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) for electric&#8208;powered aircraft. However, LIBs used for aviation exhibit rapid aging and shortened service life due to the harsh conditions of aviation, posing significant risks to flight safety. In this study, a comprehensive analysis is conducted under simulated flight conditions to reveal the degradation mechanism of aviation batteries. Low&#8208;temperature and low&#8208;pressure lead to a sluggish kinetics and hinder thermodynamic process. As the reversibility of Li&#8208;ions insertion and extraction is deteriorates, residual Li&#8208;ions accumulate and plated&#8208;Li on the anode, accelerating the aging process and arising the issue of internal short circuits. Additionally, the interatomic distance of Ni&#8208;coordination induces significant stress variations, which drives an expanded occupation of porosity in the electrode under flight conditions, with 2.13% void spaces of cathode and 13.39% of anode. The formation and growth of cracks elongate the charge transfer pathway, increasing resistance and reducing rate capability. As a result, this study quantifies the degradation mechanisms of aviation batteries and establishes the relative impact weights of temperature and pressure factors, offering critical insights for optimizing future electric aircraft power battery designs.

         <title>Amidinium&#8208;Based 2D Spacer Cations Enhance Efficiency and High&#8208;Temperature Photostability of Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D/3D heterostructures have significantly advanced the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), but their long&#8208;term photostability at elevated temperatures remains a major challenge. This study introduces amidinium&#8208;based 2D spacer cations with high pKa values to improve both the photostability and efficiency of PSCs. Unlike traditional ammonium&#8208;based passivators, amidinium cations effectively prevent detrimental deprotonation reactions that occur at high temperatures, ensuring a stable interface between 2D and 3D perovskite phases. As a result, PSCs with amidinium passivation retain 90.6% of their initial efficiency after 1000&#160;h of operation at 85&#160;&#176;C. Furthermore, amidinium&#8208;based 2D perovskite films provide excellent bulk and surface passivation effects, enabling the highest PCE of 26.52% among all reported 2D/3D PSC devices. These findings offer a promising route toward developing more durable and efficient PSCs.








Abstract
2D/3D perovskite heterojunctions represent a promising approach to enhance the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the photostability at elevated temperatures of conventional 2D/3D heterostructures, employing ammonium&#8208;based spacer cations, is severely limited by deprotonation reactions, hindering their practical application. In this study, amidinium&#8208;based 2D spacer cations as an alternative, leveraging their higher acid dissociation constants, to mitigate deprotonation&#8208;induced instability while providing excellent defect passivation effect is introduced. Amidinium passivation not only facilitates formation of thermally stable 2D/3D heterostructures but also suppresses non&#8208;radiative recombination and enhances carrier transport dynamics. PSCs with amidinium&#8208;based bulk and surface passivation achieve a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art power conversion efficiency of 26.52% for 2D/3D PSCs and exhibit outstanding high&#8208;temperature photostability, retaining 90.6% of initial efficiency after 1000&#160;h of continuous illumination at maximum power point at 85&#160;&#176;C. This work offers valuable insights into designing high&#8208;performance, durable PSCs under challenging conditions.

         <title>Optogenetics&#8208;Inspired Nanofluidic Artificial Dendrite with Spatiotemporal Integration Functions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The optical&#8208;controlled nanofluidic artificial dendrite is demonstrated by embedding layered graphene oxide within polydimethylsiloxane elastomer. The dendritic spatial and temporal integrations are reproduced by applying light spike at different position and with varying temporal sequences, respectively. The hand withdrawal reflex neuromorphic system is demonstrated, which integrates pain sensing and brain controlling information for modulating&#160;different withdrawal state of mechanical arm.








Abstract
Dendrites play an essential role in processing functions by facilitating the integration of spatial and temporal information in biological system. Nanofluidic memristors, which harness ions for signal transmission within electrolyte solutions, closely resemble biological neuronal ion channels and hold the potential for the development of biorealistic neuromorphic devices. Herein, inspired by the optogenetic technique that utilized light to tune the ions dynamic, an optical&#8208;controlled nanofluidic artificial dendrite by embedding layered graphene oxide (GO) within a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomer is developed. Taking advantage of the confinement effect of ions in the nanochannel, it has demonstrated optically&#8208;modulated ionic currents, which can effectively replicate dendritic functions. The mechanism can be attributed to the migration of Na+ ions, driven by the electric potential difference light illumination. The dendritic spatial and temporal multiport integrations are realized, including the dendritic sublinear/superlinear integrations and spike&#8208;rate&#8208;dependent plasticity (SRDP). Moreover, the hand withdrawal reflex, as a crucial mode of neuroregulation governed by central nerve and brain control signals, is replicated in the nanofluidic dendrite&#8208;based neuromorphic system, capable of managing a range of withdrawal states of a mechanical arm. This work offers a new strategy for developing nanofluidic artificial dendrite and paves the way toward developing advanced neuromorphic sensorimotor systems.

         <title>Recent Progress on Liquid Superspreading and Its Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes current analysis on superspreading mechanisms through multiscale experiments/simulations/modeling, compares superspreading performance according to different scales of small structures, and highlights applications of superspreading in thermal management, functional films/membrane fabrication, real&#8208;time medical diagnostics, desalination, and liquid separation, etc.








Abstract
The dynamic spreading of liquids on solid surfaces is essential across numerous daily and industrial processes. Surfaces that enable liquid superspreading, characterized by rapid or extensive spreading, are particularly valuable due to their implications in functional film fabrication, heat management, liquid/liquid separation, and more. Recently, significant research is conducted on liquid superspreading surfaces, with microstructure&#8208;regulated surfaces gaining increasing attention. However, the deeper correlations between microstructural physical factors and the superspreading behaviors, along with the relevant applications, remain inadequately understood. This review aims to consolidate the existing knowledge from published results and stimulate further investigation by detailing structures, functionalities, and principles for constructing liquid superspreading surfaces. Examining is began by the energy balance between input and dissipation that underpins droplet spreading dynamics. Then current designs are reviewed for superspreading surfaces, with a focus on chemical and physical aspects, giving greater emphasis to the physical perspective. Additionally, several typical applications are categorized based on liquid superspreading behaviors across various fields. Finally, the prevailing challenges are highlighted and provide insights into future research directions.

&lt;p&gt;This review summarizes current analysis on superspreading mechanisms through multiscale experiments/simulations/modeling, compares superspreading performance according to different scales of small structures, and highlights applications of superspreading in thermal management, functional films/membrane fabrication, real-time medical diagnostics, desalination, and liquid separation, etc.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dynamic spreading of liquids on solid surfaces is essential across numerous daily and industrial processes. Surfaces that enable liquid superspreading, characterized by rapid or extensive spreading, are particularly valuable due to their implications in functional film fabrication, heat management, liquid/liquid separation, and more. Recently, significant research is conducted on liquid superspreading surfaces, with microstructure-regulated surfaces gaining increasing attention. However, the deeper correlations between microstructural physical factors and the superspreading behaviors, along with the relevant applications, remain inadequately understood. This review aims to consolidate the existing knowledge from published results and stimulate further investigation by detailing structures, functionalities, and principles for constructing liquid superspreading surfaces. Examining is began by the energy balance between input and dissipation that underpins droplet spreading dynamics. Then current designs are reviewed for superspreading surfaces, with a focus on chemical and physical aspects, giving greater emphasis to the physical perspective. Additionally, several typical applications are categorized based on liquid superspreading behaviors across various fields. Finally, the prevailing challenges are highlighted and provide insights into future research directions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Generational Frontal Curing and Chemical Recycling of Polydicyclopentadiene Thermosets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Frontal polymerization meets chemical recycling: repeated rapid frontal curing, deconstruction, and chemical regeneration of polydicyclopentadiene thermosets are enabled by a small amount of a cleavable additive, a &#8220;fuel&#8221; additive, and a one&#8208;pot deconstruction&#8208;functionalization method. High thermomechanical performance and recyclability are preserved across five life cycles, offering a scalable pathway toward sustainable high&#8208;performance thermoset materials.








Abstract
Polydicyclopentadiene (pDCPD) is a high&#8208;performance thermoset with lightweight and exceptional thermomechanical properties. However, its traditional thermal curing process is energy&#8208;intensive and lacks chemical recyclability. Frontal Ring&#8208;Opening Metathesis Polymerization (FROMP) is an energy&#8208;efficient curing process and allows additive manufacturing of pDCPD. 2,3&#8208;Dihydrofuran (DHF) has been shown as an effective comonomer to allow the deconstruction of pDCPD thermosets when incorporated at a small fraction in pDCPD. Herein, a simple strategy for chemical recycling of pDCPD thermosets is reported, and maintaining FROMP characteristics and thermomechanical properties of the thermosets over five life cycles. Norbornadiene (NBD) is a key additive in resins containing recycled pDCPD to enhance polymerization kinetics and sustain FROMP characteristics. A one&#8208;pot strategy is also developed to deconstruct pDCPD thermosets and simultaneously functionalize the chain ends with norbornenes for reincorporating deconstructed oligomers back to the next generation thermoset. Using these strategies, five generations of recycling pDCPD thermosets with invariable thermomechanical properties are demonstrated. This work highlights a scalable and energy&#8208;efficient process to produce chemically recyclable pDCPD thermosets, significantly improving the circularity of this class of high&#8208;performance thermosets.

         <title>An Interlayer Anchored NiMo/MoO2 Electrocatalyst for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction in Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis at High Current Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cost&#8208;effective and scalable method is developed to construct an interlayer&#8208;anchored heterostructured electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution at ampere&#8208;scale current densities. The noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free anion&#8208;exchange membrane water electrolysis device, utilizing this catalyst as the cathode, exhibits superior activity and stability. This study offers insights into the design of efficient and robust HER catalysts for industrial&#8208;scale hydrogen generation.








Abstract
Noble metal&#8208;free electrodes for anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEM&#8208;WE) operating at high current densities are critical for sustainable hydrogen production. However, the massive amount of bubbles resulted in insufficient mass transfer and unevenly distributed local stress, which poses a major challenge in designing an efficient and robust hydrogen evolution catalyst. Herein, a facile chemical corrosion method is developed to synthesize an interlayer&#8208;anchored NiMo/MoO2 catalyst on a nickel foam (NF) substrate (NiMo/Int/NF) with high hydrogen evolution activity (overpotential of 80.2 &#177; 3.53&#160;mV) and durability (stable for 5000&#160;h) at 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in 1&#160;m KOH. The interlayer tightly anchors the catalytic layer to the substrate, providing high compressive strength and strong adhesion to mitigate the bubble shock at a high current density. In situ Raman and X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses reveal that the heterostructural catalytic layer can accelerate the hydrogen evolution reaction with increased local pH and high component utilization. Using NiMo/Int/NF as the cathode, the assembled noble metal&#8208;free AEM&#8208;WE device exhibits a low cell voltage of 1.78&#160;V at 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 (significantly lower than that of a Pt/C&#8208;catalyzed cell (1.94&#160;V)) while also showing excellent stability for 3000&#160;h.

         <title>Ice&#8208;Confined Cryo&#8208;Polymerization of Sponge&#8208;Like Hydrogels with Self&#8208;Adapting Channel for Solar Water Purification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ice&#8208;confined cryo&#8208;polymerization method is proposed for the preparation of sponge&#8208;like hydrogels. By this method, strong interactions between polymer chains and orientation can be realized, and the hydrogels are endowed with ultrafast water transport capability. The spongy hydrogels are also able to self&#8208;regulate the pore size under different light intensities achieving ultra&#8208;high water evaporation rates.








Abstract
Polymer hydrogels are widely used in solar&#8208;driven water evaporation due to their controllable vaporization enthalpy, but the low water transport rates restrict their application. Here, a sponge&#8208;like polyacrylamide/carbon nanotube hydrogel is prepared by ice&#8208;confined cryo&#8208;polymerization, which possesses micro&#8208;size and non&#8208;swelling skeleton, and exhibits both hydrogel and sponge behaviors such as excellent squeezability and superior water transport capabilities about three orders of magnitude higher than that of conventional hydrogels. Moreover, the hydrogels can spontaneously regulate the size of internal channels to adjust the capillary force and thus they can support a water evaporation rate as high as 36.11&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 under collecting lens. Furthermore, the hydrogels show high water collection rate of 5.55&#160;g g&#8722;1 under fog flow and the collected water can be quickly released by squeezing. The ice&#8208;confined cryo&#8208;polymerization provides a new way to develop distinctive materials combining the advantage of both hydrogel and sponge.

         <title>Steering Yolk&#8211;Shell Nanostructures of 1D Unit&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks as Binder Modulators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A kind of 1D unit&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks with yolk&#8211;shell nanomorphology is prepared via a solvent&#8208;induced strategy that can be applied as binder modulators for Li&#8208;S batteries.








Abstract
Induced by their weak chain interactions, 1D unit&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (1D COFs) are favorable in molecular assembly, yet their exploration in morphology engineering and related energy storage applications are still rare. Here, a series of 1D COFs based nano&#8208;structures (i.e. yolk&#8211;shell spheres (YS&#8208;COF), hollow spheres (HS&#8208;COF) and solid spheres (SS&#8208;COF)) is prepared via a solvent&#8208;induced strategy that can be applied as binder modulators for Li&#8208;S batteries. Specifically, they can impart enhanced mechanical properties, more adaptability to volume change, and better ability in adsorbing/catalyzing lithium polysulfide intermediates (LiPSs) to traditional PVDF binder. Remarkably, the thus&#8208;assembled YS&#8208;COF&#8208;based cell displays an initial specific capacity of up to 1011 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 C, which is much higher than that of HS&#8208;COF, SS&#8208;COF, and PVDF&#8208;based Li&#8208;S batteries. Even at 4 C, it still maintains a discharge specific capacity of 962 mAh g&#8722;1 and can cycle for &gt;600 cycles. DFT calculations and finite element simulation reveal the important roles of nanomorphology and functional groups of YS&#8208;COF in promoting electrochemical redox kinetics to boost battery performances. This strategy might provide in&#8208;depth insights in the morphology engineering and performance optimization of 1D COFs for Li&#8208;S batteries.

         <title>4D&#8208;Printed Adaptive and Programmable Shape&#8208;Morphing Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adaptive programmable shape&#8208;morphing batteries are presented by chemically integrating covalently crosslinked zinc&#8208;ion microbatteries with shape&#8208;programmable liquid crystal elastomers through sequentially direct&#8208;ink&#8208;writing printing. Advanced shape&#8208;morphing battery systems capable of interactive communication and adaptive sensing can autonomously modulate their deployable configuration in response to environmental variations, which enables them to adaptively reconfigure morphology to accommodate different functionalities.









Abstract
Shape&#8208;morphing batteries that can reconfigure their shape to adapt to different tasks are highly desirable for emerging soft electronics in diverse fields. However, it is a challenging task to develop advanced shape&#8208;morphing batteries with on&#8208;demand programmability and adaptive responsiveness. Here, 4D&#8208;printed programmable shape&#8208;morphing batteries by sequentially direct&#8208;ink&#8208;writing of shape&#8208;programmable liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) and in&#8208;situ covalent crosslinked flexible zinc&#8208;ion microbatteries, where tough covalent bonding is built at the interface, are reported. The resulting shape&#8208;morphing batteries exhibit controllable, reversible, and programmable shape&#8208;morphing by controlling sophisticated molecular alignment of LCEs, which enables them to adaptively alter configurations to accommodate different functionalities. Importantly, diverse origami batteries with excellent spatiotemporal controllability are demonstrated by precisely designing active hinges to achieve adaptive transformations from folded to deployed configurations. The programmable shape&#8208;morphing mechanisms of the batteries are revealed by finite element analyses. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept illustration, adaptive shape&#8208;morphing battery systems capable of interactive communication and controllable sensing are developed through the incorporation of an elaborate all&#8208;MXene&#8208;printed near&#8208;field&#8208;communication antenna, which can adaptively tune its deployment configuration according to variations in environmental humidity or dust content. This work brings new insights for the development of next&#8208;generation shape&#8208;morphing power sources, human&#8208;machine interactive electronics, and swarm intelligence.

         <title>The Role of Lattice Distortion in Catalysis: Functionality and Distinctions from Strain</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review distinguishes between lattice distortion and strain, emphasizing their origins, characterization methods, and roles in catalysis. It highlights lattice distortion's contributions to catalytic functionality and reactivity via structural modulation, charge migration, surface chemistry, stability, adsorption, reaction pathways, active sites, and coupled effects, and outlines future challenges in multi&#8208;scale characterization and sustainable catalyst design.








Abstract
Achieving high&#8208;performance catalysts is imperative for clean energy and environmental applications. In this context, an expanding body of research underscores the critical significance of structural modifications, with lattice distortion emerging as an intrinsic reconfiguration of atomic arrangements that profoundly influences catalytic processes. By contrast, strain typically arises from interfacial mismatches or external forces. Building on these distinctions, this review systematically compares these concepts, examining their definitions, origins, criteria, characterization methods, and impacts on catalytic activity. Special emphasis is placed on the mechanistic roles of lattice distortion in catalysis, particularly its ability to enhance function through intrinsic structure modification, carrier migration dynamics modulation, surface chemistry modulation, and enhanced catalyst stability. Furthermore, the impact of lattice distortion on enhancing catalytic reactivity is elucidated by influencing molecular adsorption and activation, optimizing reaction pathways, tailoring active sites, and coupling with spin polarization effects to promote efficient catalytic performance. Finally, the remaining challenges and future outlook in the synergistic regulation of local distortion and strain, multi&#8208;scale dynamic in&#8208;situ characterization, and sustainable strategies for practical applications are discussed, offering valuable insights for advancing efficient and scalable chemical and energy transformation technologies.

         <title>Traceless Photopolymerization with Non&#8208;Pulsed Red Light Enables 3D&#8208;Printable Cell&#8208;Laden Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The paper presents a red&#8208;light&#8208;induced polymerization process, initiated by the FDA&#8208;approved dye methylene blue and the cytocompatible co&#8208;initiator triethanolamine, for fabricating hydrogels. This photopolymerization process is oxygen&#8208;tolerant, cytocompatible, and, most importantly, leaves no color traces, resulting in completely transparent scaffolds. The photoinitiating system is successfully applied for extrusion&#8208;based 3D (bio)printing of cell&#8208;laden hydrogels.








Abstract
Photocrosslinking of hydrogels with non&#8208;pulsed red light offers improved biocompatibility and deep tissue penetration in contrast to traditional UV&#8208;initiated methods. However, hydrogels fabricated upon red&#8208;light excitation are always colored by a photoinitiator, limiting their use in applications requiring high optical transparency, such as (bio)sensors, ophthalmological applications, or wound dressings. Additionally, the cytotoxicity of a photoinitiator is always a concern, especially in bioapplications. Herein, a photoinitiating system composed of an FDA&#8208;approved methylene blue photosensitizer and cytocompatible triethanolamine is introduced. The system can induce photopolymerization upon 625 nm irradiation and leaves no visible trace of the methylene blue color afterward, thus named &#8220;traceless&#8221;. With this approach, gelatine methacrylate hydrogel is successfully polymerized under ambient conditions. The hydrogel is permanently colorless with well&#8208;controlled stiffness due to the light&#8208;dependent nature of the polymerization process. The system is further successfully applied in extrusion&#8208;based 3D&#8208;bioprinting with NIH&#8208;3T3 fibroblasts, followed by photocuring to produce cell&#8208;laden 3D structures, indicating its potential for tissue engineering. Upon culturing the cell&#8208;laden constructs, the fibroblasts are able to proliferate and adhere to the hydrogel material. The red&#8208;light excitation enables polymerization through at least 5&#160;mm of biological tissue, projecting, inter alia, its use for transdermal photopolymerization in minimally invasive implantation.

         <title>Untying the Knot: A Fully Recyclable, Solvent&#8208;Free, Wide&#8208;Spectral Photocurable Thermoset Adhesive</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a solvent&#8208;free, recyclable adhesive that cures rapidly under visible light (400&#8211;650 nm) while maintaining robust adhesion across diverse substrates. Recyclable via simple microwave irradiation, it combines high performance with optical and bioadaptive potential, representing a significant advancement toward sustainable, circular&#8208;economy&#8208;compatible adhesive technologies.








Abstract
Adhesives are vital in industries ranging from aerospace to consumer electronics. However, their reliance on non&#8208;recyclable polymers makes them suitable for one&#8208;time use and results in significant economic and environmental challenges. Reversible adhesives, based on covalent adaptable networks, address these issues and open possibilities for applications, including recyclable multi&#8208;layer packaging, removable labels, and fully recyclable electronics &#8211; batteries, smartphones, etc. Despite progress in dynamic and reversible bonds, current solutions often compromise performance or the ability to detach from substrates. This study proposes reversible high&#8208;performance adhesives that can undergo cycles of bonding&#8208;debonding without commonly reported need to add solvent, high&#8208;temperature processing or use deep&#8208;UV irradiation while maintaining adhesives' functionality and reducing environmental impact. The bonding is done by rapid photocuring, which occurs within 30 seconds&#160;under irradiation at a wide range of visible wavelengths (400&#8211;650&#160;nm) while achieving constant adhesion strength across diverse substrates, including underwater adhesion. De&#8208;bonding is achieved using a simple household microwave. Furthermore, the adhesive's transparency and high refractive index enable its use in various optical applications, whereas its robustness in wet conditions expands its potential for bioadaptive or underwater systems. This adhesive represents a significant step toward sustainable adhesives that seamlessly integrate high performance with circular&#8208;economy principles.

         <title>Anisotropy Engineering for Constructing Gradient Electrodes with High&#8208;Efficiency Bi/C Catalyst In Situ for Iron&#8208;Chromium Flow Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work found the current density anisotropy at the negative electrode in the ICFB by multi&#8208;physical field simulation. Therefore, a strategy of anisotropy engineering for constructing gradient electrodes is carried out successfully. A high&#8208;efficiency carbon&#8208;loaded bismuth catalyst is fabricated and introduced on the electrode in situ with the assistance of PVP.








Abstract
Iron&#8208;chromium flow batteries (ICFBs) are regarded as one of the most potential large&#8208;scale energy storage devices. Nevertheless, the slow dynamics of the Cr3+/Cr2+ redox couples hinder the development of ICFBs. Here, a high&#8208;efficiency carbon&#8208;loaded bismuth (Bi/C) catalyst is fabricated and introduced on the electrode in situ to improve the dynamics with the assistance of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). To derive the greatest value, we explore the current density anisotropy in ICFB and design a strategy of anisotropy engineering to meet the requirements of the anisotropy for catalysts. In the work, the gradient electrode (G&#8208;PBiC/TCF) with a high&#8208;efficiency Bi/C catalyst is successfully prepared. In addition, the ICFB assembled with the G&#8208;PBiC/TCF(M/m, the side of more catalysts facing the Membrane side) shows excellent battery performance. It can run over 500 cycles with EE of 81.36% at 120 mA cm&#8722;2, which is the longest cycle life reported. Furthermore, the catalytic mechanism and the effect of the catalyst distribution on the performance are explained by the DFT calculation and multi&#8208;physical field simulation. This work provides a novel pathway to design that catalyst&#8208;supported gradient electrode with high performance and low cost.

         <title>CO2&#8208;Responsive Smart Wood Scaffold for Natural Organic Matter Removal without Secondary Pollution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CO2&#8208;responsive smart wood scaffold is developed for sustainable water purification, achieving efficient natural organic matter (NOM) removal and microbial disinfection without secondary pollution. The CO2&#8208;responsive polymer coating undergoes protonation upon CO2 exposure, enabling strong cation&#8722;&#960; interactions with NOM. This scalable and eco&#8208;friendly strategy provides a breakthrough solution for high&#8208;performance, chemical&#8208;free water treatment across diverse environmental conditions.








Abstract
Ensuring drinking water safety remains a critical challenge, particularly when treating complex water sources, due to secondary pollution caused by active chemical additives. Herein, a novel CO2&#8208;responsive smart wood scaffold that leverages non&#8208;toxic CO2 activation is developed to achieve highly efficient removal of carcinogenic natural organic matter (NOM) and broad&#8208;spectrum microbial disinfection without requiring additional chemical agents. Unlike conventional water purification techniques that face a safety&#8208;efficacy trade&#8208;off, the multi&#8208;stage CO2&#8208;responsive wood scaffold offers exceptional tunability in NOM abatement across diverse environmental conditions, including variable water chemistry, NOM composition, high salinity, and real&#8208;world water sources. The purified water meets stringent drinking water standards (e.g., UV254 reduction, dissolved organic carbon removal, and bacterial elimination). It is found that the highly efficient NOM adsorption mainly originates from the strong and stable CO2&#8208;triggered cation&#8722;&#960; interaction between the scaffold surface and aromatic NOM groups, as revealed via high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry and direct intermolecular force measurements. This ecofriendly and contamination&#8208;free CO2&#8208;responsive strategy provides a transformative approach to overcoming secondary pollution challenges in water purification, offering a scalable and sustainable platform for environmental applications and beyond.

         <title>Toward Zero&#8208;Excess Alkali Metal Batteries: Bridging Experimental and Computational Insights</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores zero&#8208;excess alkali metal batteries, highlighting anode&#8211;electrolyte interfaces, metal nucleation, dendrite growth, and SEI formation while comparing Li, Na, and K metals. It critically examines electrolyte and separator roles, emphasizing substrate design, electrolyte modifications, interfacial engineering, and solid&#8208;state electrolytes. Experimental and computational advancements are integrated to guide future developments.








Abstract
This review introduces alkali metal (Li, Na, and K) anode&#8208;less and anode&#8208;free batteries and conveys a synopsis of the current challenges regarding anode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces. The review focuses on a critical analysis of the fundamental understanding of the (eletro)chemical and (electro)physical processes occurring at the anode, including metal nucleation and dendrite growth, the properties of liquid and solid electrolytes, and their roles in the metal stripping/deposition process and the formation of solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase, and the properties of separators and their role in inhibiting dendrite growth. Solutions to tackle the challenges for anode&#8208;less and anode&#8208;free batteries are discussed extensively in the aspects of the modifications of the anode substrate, novel electrolyte solutions and SEI structures, interface design, and novel separators/solid&#8208;state electrolytes to enable stable battery performances. To highlight the importance of bridging experimental and computational insights, experimental progress derived from a range of advanced characterization techniques is analyzed in combination with the advancement in multi&#8208;scale theory and computational modeling. Finally, outlooks are provided from both experimental and computational points of view for the exciting field of zero&#8208;excess alkali metal batteries.

         <title>3D Printing of Auxetic Self&#8208;powered Mechanoluminescent Photonic Skins for Underwater Communication and Safety Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D&#8208;printed self&#8208;powered auxetic mechanoluminescent photonic skin for underwater communication and safety monitoring is introduced. Its auxetic structures, with a negative Poisson's ratio, ensure exceptional conformability to curved surfaces, enhancing adaptability to dynamic underwater environments. Encapsulated in silicone, it offers outstanding stretchability, brightness, and durability even in harsh conditions, enabling reliable deep&#8208;sea exploration.








Abstract
Stretchable mechanoluminescent (ML) photonic skin with strong and stable brightness holds great promise for underwater communication and safety monitoring. However, traditional film&#8208;based ML devices often lack the compliance needed to accommodate curved surfaces and face a trade&#8208;off between extensibility and luminescent intensity. This study introduces a 3D&#8208;printed self&#8208;powered auxetic ML photonic skin. By utilizing auxetic materials with a negative Poisson's ratio, we created a stretchable ML device that conforms to complex, curved surfaces, enhancing its applicability in dynamic underwater settings. By encapsulating the auxetic ML structure in silicone, simultaneous improvements in brightness uniformity and stretchability are achieved. The device exhibits remarkable durability, maintaining consistent light emission and mechanical performance over 10&#8201;000 cycles, and demonstrates the potential for real&#8208;time underwater communication and safety monitoring. Integrated into a glove, a swimming toy, and a gas tank, the photonic skin successfully transmitted Morse code signals and detected gas leaks, showcasing its versatility and robustness in harsh underwater conditions. These findings underscore the potential of this technology to improve safety and efficiency in marine exploration, paving the way for further advancements in underwater robotics and communication.

         <title>Multiplex Methionine Modulating Hydrogel for Cancer Metabolic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiplex methionine modulating hydrogel (3 M Gel) is fabricated as a type of dual&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive drug delivery system, enabling in situ triple intervention of intracellular methionine metabolism and extracellular methionine uptake. This multilayered methionine blockade strategy achieves superior antitumor efficacy without systemic side effects in breast, liver, and colorectal cancers, and effectively overcomes tumor resistance to immune checkpoint blockade therapy.








Abstract
The reliance on high levels of methionine by tumor cells provides an attractive target for cancer treatment. However, systemic methionine blockade may raise concerns about potential side effects given the broad and essential functions of methionine in cellular metabolism. Here, a combined drug delivery platform for multilayered constraint of methionine within tumor lesions is developed. Small molecule inhibitors PF9366 and adenosine dialdehyde are encapsulated by tumor cell&#8208;targeting nanoparticles (NPs) to achieve a cascaded blockage of intracellular methionine metabolism. These NPs are further co&#8208;loaded with the extracellular methionine uptake inhibitor JPH203 into a type of reactive oxygen species&#8208;sensitive hydrogel, assembling the multiplex methionine modulating hydrogel (3&#160;M Gel). In murine models of triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC), hepatocellular carcinoma, and colorectal cancer, the in situ formed 3&#160;M Gel exhibits superior efficacy in restricting S&#8208;adenosyl methionine generation and histone methylation, stimulating immunogenic cell death in tumor cells, thereby eliciting potent innate and adaptive immune responses to restrain tumor progression. Moreover, remodeling of the tumor microenvironment by 3&#160;M Gel overcomes immune checkpoint blockade resistance in TNBC. This study presents a localized triple regulation strategy and paves a new path for amino acid starvation&#8208;based cancer therapy.

         <title>Scaling Up Purcell&#8208;Enhanced Self&#8208;Assembled Nanoplasmonic Perovskite Scintillators into the Bulk Regime</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a scalable approach to enhancing bulk scintillators using nanoplasmonics. By integrating 100&#8208;nm silver nanoparticles with perovskite scintillator nanocrystals in a polymer matrix, significant improvements in light yield and decay rates via the Purcell effect are achieved. Experiments confirm up to 4.2&#8208;fold enhancements, offering a pathway for advanced radiation detection in medical imaging and security applications.









Abstract
Scintillators convert high&#8208;energy radiation into detectable photons and play a crucial role in medical imaging and security applications. The enhancement of scintillator performance through nanophotonics and nanoplasmonics, specifically using the Purcell effect, has shown promise but has so far been limited to ultrathin scintillator films because of the localized nature of this effect. This study introduces a method to expand the application of nanoplasmonic scintillators to the bulk regime. By integrating 100&#8208;nm&#8208;sized plasmonic spheroid and cuboid nanoparticles with perovskite scintillator nanocrystals, nanoplasmonic scintillators are enabled to function effectively within bulk&#8208;scale devices. Power and decay rate enhancements of up to (3.20 &#177; 0.20) and (4.20 &#177; 0.31) folds are experimentally demonstrated for plasmonic spheroid and cuboid nanoparticles, respectively, in a 5&#8208;mm thick CsPbBr3 nanocrystal&#8208;polymer scintillator at RT. Theoretical modeling also predicts similar enhancements of up to (2.26 &#177; 0.31) and (3.02 &#177; 0.69) folds for the same nanoparticle shapes and dimensions. Moreover, a (2.07 &#177; 0.39) fold increase in light yield under 241Am &#947;&#8208;excitation is demonstrated. These findings provide a viable pathway for utilizing nanoplasmonics to enhance bulk scintillator devices, advancing radiation detection&#160;technology.

Power and decay rate enhancements of up to (3.20 &#177; 0.20) and (4.20 &#177; 0.31) folds are experimentally demonstrated for plasmonic spheroid and cuboid nanoparticles, respectively, in a 5-mm thick CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanocrystal-polymer scintillator at RT. Theoretical modeling also predicts similar enhancements of up to (2.26 &#177; 0.31) and (3.02 &#177; 0.69) folds for the same nanoparticle shapes and dimensions. Moreover, a (2.07 &#177; 0.39) fold increase in light yield under &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am &#947;-excitation is demonstrated. These findings provide a viable pathway for utilizing nanoplasmonics to enhance bulk scintillator devices, advancing radiation detection&#160;technology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Iron Balance Dual&#8208;Drive Strategy (IBDS) Promotes Bone Regeneration in Smokers by Regulating Mitochondrial Iron Homeostasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cigarette smoke disrupts cellular iron balance, impairing bone healing in smokers. An iron balance dual&#8208;drive strategy combats this by removing harmful excess iron from &#8220;cell powerhouses&#8221; and boosting natural iron storage. This dual&#8208;action restores energy production, blocks cell death, and accelerates bone repair&#8212;a breakthrough approach for treating smoking&#8208;related bone defects and iron&#8208;overload diseases.








Abstract
Cigarette smoke (CS) disrupts mitochondrial iron homeostasis, causing excess free iron to generate reactive oxygen species, leading to oxidative stress and impairing tissue repair. For smokers undergoing bone defect repair, achieving precise control over the balance between mitochondrial free iron and stored iron, while simultaneously enhancing endogenous iron homeostasis, poses a considerable challenge. This study introduces the iron balance dual&#8208;drive strategy (IBDS), which efficiently chelates mitochondrial free iron and promotes ferritin synthesis to create a FerritinBank for iron deposition, thus optimizing endogenous iron homeostasis. IBDS is delivered through an injectable, biodegradable iron&#8208;capturing hydrogel (SilMA/gelMA/DPT). The released DPT selectively targets and chelates free iron within mitochondria, modulating mitochondrial dynamics to restore their function. This action is complemented by the promotion of ferritin synthesis, which serves to bolster endogenous iron homeostasis and suppress ferroptosis. Transcriptomic sequencing and experimental data suggest that DPT corrects energy metabolism abnormalities and promotes mitochondrial macromolecule synthesis. In vivo studies confirm that the iron&#8208;capturing hydrogel significantly improves the healing of smoking&#8208;induced calvarial bone defects. This is the first report of nanoparticles promoting ferritin synthesis to build an endogenous iron reservoir, highlighting the potential of the IBDS strategy for bone regeneration in smokers and other iron&#8208;overload&#8208;related conditions.

         <title>Mussel&#8208;Inspired Molecular Strategies for Fabricating Functional Materials With Underwater Adhesion and Self&#8208;Healing Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review systematically examines the nanomechanical mechanisms of mussel&#8208;inspired molecular interactions, primarily investigated by direct force measurement techniques such as surface forces apparatus and atomic force microscopy. The macroscopic adhesive and self&#8208;healing performances of mussel&#8208;inspired functional materials, including coacervates, coatings, and hydrogels, are correlated with the underlying reversible and dynamic molecular interactions.








Abstract
The exceptional underwater adhesion and self&#8208;healing capabilities of mussels have fascinated researchers for over two decades. Extensive studies have shown that these remarkable properties arise from a series of reversible and dynamic molecular interactions involving mussel foot proteins. Inspired by these molecular interaction strategies, numerous functional materials exhibiting strong underwater adhesion and self&#8208;healing performance have been successfully developed. This review systematically explores the nanomechanical mechanisms of mussel&#8208;inspired molecular interactions, mainly revealed&#160;by direct force measurement techniques such as surface forces apparatus and atomic force microscopy. The development of functional materials, including coacervates, coatings, and hydrogels, with underwater adhesion and self&#8208;healing properties, is then summarized. Furthermore, the macroscopic material&#160;performances are correlated with the underlying molecular mechanisms, providing valuable insights for the rational design of next&#8208;generation mussel&#8208;inspired functional materials with enhanced underwater adhesion and self&#8208;healing properties.

         <title>Tailoring Protein Adsorption at the Solid&#8211;Liquid Interface for Long&#8208;Term Superhemophobicity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conventional superhydrophobic surfaces struggle to repel blood long&#8208;term due to protein adsorption, disrupting the Cassie&#8211;Baxter state. Inspired by Salvinia, a heterogeneous superhemophobic surface is engineered by integrating protein&#8208;resistant hydrophilic molecules, significantly extending blood&#8208;repellency time&#8212;over 10 times longer than conventional superhydrophobic surfaces&#8212;thus maintaining robust superhemophobicity.








Abstract
Super&#8208;repellent surfaces with micro/nanoscale roughness can sustain blood in the Cassie&#8211;Baxter state and minimize the solid&#8211;liquid contact area, exhibiting potential for biomedical applications. Conventional superhydrophobic surfaces with hydrophobic solid&#8211;liquid interface are susceptible to protein adsorption under blood flow, leading to a transition to the Wenzel state and increasing the risk of thrombosis. Inspired by Salvinia, hydrophilic molecules are incorporated at the solid&#8211;liquid contact area based on the interaction between blood and the surface topography as well as chemistry, thereby engineering a chemically heterogeneous superhemophobic surface which effectively prevents protein adsorption and maintains a long&#8208;term Cassie&#8211;Baxter state. The blood&#8208;repellent time of the heterogeneous surface is greater than tenfold those of conventional superhydrophobic surfaces. In vivo rabbit blood circulation confirms sustained hemocompatibility and effective thrombosis resistance, demonstrating prolonged superhemophobicity for over 55&#160;h. The heterogeneous design ensures extended resistance to complex biological fluids and is promising for the development of blood&#8208;contacting devices, such as the gas&#8208;permeable blood&#8208;repellent membranes for extracorporeal membrane oxygenators.

The heterogeneous design ensures extended resistance to complex biological fluids and is promising for the development of blood-contacting devices, such as the gas-permeable blood-repellent membranes for extracorporeal membrane oxygenators.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Large Spin&#8208;Orbit Torque with Multi&#8208;Directional Spin Components in Ni4W</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni4W is theoretically proposed and experimentally verified as a promising unconventional spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT) material for generating multi&#8208;directional spins. Epitaxial Ni4W thin films with outstanding crystallinity are grown by magnetron sputtering. Multi&#8208;directional spins are observed by harmonic Hall measurements, and the conventional SOT efficiency is evaluated to be 0.73, marking the largest value reported for unconventional SOT materials to date.








Abstract
Spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT) offers an efficient mechanism for manipulating the magnetization of ferromagnetic materials in spintronics&#8208;based memory and logic devices. However, conventional SOT materials, such as heavy metals and topological insulators, are limited by high crystal symmetry to generating and injecting only in&#8208;plane spins into the ferromagnet. Low&#8208;symmetry materials and symmetry&#8208;breaking strategies have been employed to generate unconventional spin currents with out&#8208;of&#8208;plane spin polarization, enabling field&#8208;free deterministic switching of perpendicular magnetization. Despite this progress, the SOT efficiency of these materials has typically remained low. Here, a large SOT efficiency of 0.3 in the bulk Ni4W at room temperature is reported, as evaluated by second harmonic Hall measurements. In addition, due to the low crystal symmetry of Ni4W, unconventional SOT from the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane and Dresselhaus&#8208;like spin components are observed. Notably, a large SOT efficiency of 0.73 is observed in W/Ni4W (5&#160;nm), potentially resulting from additional interfacial contributions or extrinsic effects. Furthermore, field&#8208;free switching of perpendicular magnetization has been achieved using the multi&#8208;directional SOT of Ni4W, highlighting its potential as a low&#8208;symmetry SOT material for energy&#8208;efficient spintronic devices.

         <title>DNA&#8208;Engineered Modular Nanovaccines Featuring Precise Topology for Enhanced Immunogenicity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA&#8208;programmed topological assembly approach to prescribe the receptor&#8208;binding domain (RBD) from SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 with line&#8208;shaped and branched connection. It is found that branching&#8208;connected RBDs induced stronger humoral immunity than linear&#8208;connected RBDs, potentially due to enhanced antigen&#8208;B cell receptor synergistic interactions.








Abstract
Multivalent display of antigens can boost subunit vaccine immunogenicity. However, owing to the inherent difficulty in programmatically controlling the topology of multivalent antigens, its impact on antigen immunogenicity remains elusive. In this study, DNA&#8208;mediated modular precision assembly is employed to organize SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 receptor&#8208;binding domains (RBDs) with different topological connections while preserving their epitopes. It is found that branching&#8208;connected RBDs induced significantly higher IgG titers than linear&#8208;connected RBDs at higher antigen valency (&#8805;4). This increase in IgG response is associated with stronger B cell proliferation, likely due to enhanced antigen&#8208;receptor synergistic interactions leading to enhanced B cell receptor signaling. Branching&#8208;connected RBDs also provided superior humoral immunity in mice and stronger protection in SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8208;infected hamsters compared to adjuvanted RBD. This work highlights the role of antigen topology in vaccine design and offers a universal modular platform for producing more effective subunit vaccines.

         <title>Acid/Base&#8208;Responsive Circularly Polarized Luminescence Emitters with Configurationally Stable Nitrogen Stereogenic Centers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Circularly Polarized Luminescence (CPL) emitters based on Tr&#246;ger's base analogues bearing two peripheral fluorophores (anthracene, pyrene or 9,9&#8208;dimethylfluorene) are prepared following a straightforward and versatile synthetic approach from common precursors. The use of configurationally stable ethano&#8208;bridged Tr&#246;ger's base analogs leads to an acid/base&#8208;driven CPL switch.








Abstract
A way to prevent the fast configurational interconversion of tertiary amines is to invoke Tr&#246;ger's base analogs, which display methano&#8208; or ethano&#8208;bridged diazocine cores fused to aromatic rings. These derivatives are configurationally stable, even in acidic media when their structures bear ethylene bridges. Here, a two&#8208; to three&#8208;step synthesis is presented of methano&#8208; and ethano&#8208;bridged Tr&#246;ger's base analogs with two peripheral fluorophores, i.e., anthracene, pyrene, and 9,9&#8208;dimethylfluorene units. These compounds, possessing two nitrogen stereogenic centers, exhibit good circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) dissymmetry factors (|glum| up to 1.2 &#215; 10&#8722;3) and brightnesses (BCPL up to 26.3 M&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1), as well as excellent fluorescence quantum yields, demonstrating the Tr&#246;ger&#180;s base core to be a convenient scaffold to prepare CPL emitters upon functionalization with simple achiral fluorophores. Furthermore, the configurationally stable ethano&#8208;bridged Tr&#246;ger's base analogs are employed to modulate their CPL response, generating a CPL switch through their protonation/deprotonation by consecutive additions of acid and base. The reversibility of the switching process is demonstrated for two cycles without altering the CPL performance of the molecule. It is believed that this straightforward and efficient approach to building CPL emitters employing the Tr&#246;ger's base core could lead to its incorporation in CPL&#8208;based sensors and materials.

         <title>Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries with Superlong Cycle&#8208;Life in Wide Temperature Range via Interfacial Alkyl&#8208;Chain Sway</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work has designed a wide&#8208;temperature lithium&#8208;ion battery with a bionic&#8208;drive cathode interphase. The 15 nm ultrafine nano&#8208;Mg(OH)2 with Tween80 (nano&#8208;MHs@Tween80) are introduced into the LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2. The nano&#8208;MHs accelerate to form a stable inorganic CEI. The Tween80 molecules improve electrolyte flow and facilitate efficient lithium&#8208;ion transport by the alkyl&#8208;chain sway. The cycle&#8208;life of the battery is significantly prolonged in a wide temperature range.








Abstract
The cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase directly influences the wide&#8208;temperature performance of lithium&#8208;ion batteries, particularly long&#8208;term cycle performance. However, improving both high&#8208; and low&#8208;temperature properties of cathode often requires distinct approaches, making it challenging to unify these strategies. In this work, an interfacial&#8208;driven strategy on the cathode surface is designed with nano&#8208;Mg(OH)2 with Tween80 (nano&#8208;Mg(OH)2@Tween80). Tween80 serves as the framework of the weak&#8208;linked flexible confined space for preparing ultrafine nano&#8208;Mg(OH)2 and then adsorbs in situ onto the nano&#8208;Mg(OH)2. In the cell assembled with nano&#8208;Mg(OH)2@Tween80 modified LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2, the alkyl&#8208;chain sway of Tween80 molecules accelerates electrolyte diffusion on cathode surface. Hence, both the timely formation of a stable and conductive Mg&#8208;rich interphase layer and rapid lithium&#8208;ion transfer are achieved, leading to the co&#8208;improvement of high/low&#8208;temperature performances. The half&#8208;cell with the addition of nano&#8208;Mg(OH)2@Tween80, maintains over 70 mAh&#183;g&#8722;1 and 90% Coulombic efficiency after 1000 cycles at 60&#160;&#176;C, and keeps 80 mAh&#183;g&#8722;1 with 99% Coulombic efficiency after 500 cycles at &#8722;5&#160;&#176;C, even still very stable at &#8722;15&#160;&#176;C.

         <title>Built&#8208;in Electric Field in Ru/CoP Bifunctional Electrocatalyst Enhances Hydrazine&#8208;Assisted Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction of Ru/CoP heterostructure induces interfacial interaction, which mitigates the strong adsorption of *H on Ru sites while promoting hydrogen spillover and enhancing *H coverage on Co sites. Moreover, the adsorption of N2H4 is improved on Ru sites. This Ru/CoP heterostructure greatly improves the bifunctional electrocatalytic activity of HER and HzOR and realizes efficient and energy&#8208;saving hydrogen production.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic hydrazine&#8208;assisted water splitting, incorporating the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR), offers a promising avenue for hydrogen production. Herein, a Ru/CoP heterostructure is introduced, which enhances bifunctional catalytic activity through interfacial interaction induced by the built&#8208;in electric field between Ru nanoparticles and CoP nanosheets. This interaction optimizes the adsorption of intermediates and facilitates improved HER performances by weakening the strong adsorption of active hydrogen species (*H) on Ru and enhancing *H coverage on CoP through hydrogen spillover. Additionally, this electron interaction promotes the adsorption of N2H4 and its subsequent dehydrogenation, vital for HzOR activity. The heterostructure's significant reduction in required potentials for both reactions underscores its efficiency and potential economic benefits over traditional systems. Furthermore, the study validates the feasibility of using this approach for practical applications in sustainable hydrogen production, emphasizing its lower operational costs and enhanced catalytic stability and activity. This work not only showcases the practical applications of Ru/CoP but also underscores the broader applicability of heterostructure strategy in designing efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To shape the future course of research in reticular materials, this work reflects on the progress over the past 30 years, complemented by input from the community of 228 active researchers through a global, crowdsourced survey: ranging from demographics, how it works, publish and interact, to highlights on both academic and industrial milestones, as well as remaining challenges.








Abstract
The field of reticular materials, such as metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs), is expanding continuously &#8211; be it in terms of novel structures, advanced characterization techniques, or record&#8208;breaking physical properties for applications. This timeline review reflects on the progress over the past 30 years, complemented by input from the community of active researchers. Owing to a global, crowdsourced survey of 228 researchers that is conducted through an online questionnaire, recent insights into the demographics of the field are given. Besides revealing how it works, publish, and interact, the review highlights both academic and industrial milestones. The contemporary trends are described, both at the level of material development and their suitability for a range of applications. To pave the way for newcomers to the field, some remaining challenges and steps to overcome them are discussed. The findings from this contemplative review aim to shape the future course of research in this domain.

         <title>Versatile Superlubricity via Boronizing on Engineering Alloys: Insights into In Situ Passivation Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust and versatile solid&#8211;liquid superlubricity strategy for engineering alloys is achieved via the synergistic chemical of surface boronization and polyols lubricant. Experiments and MD simulations indicate that weak interactions between the polyol lubricant and the in situ generated &#8211;CxHy passivation layer minimize friction and heat dissipation. Experiments on OTS&#8208;modified surfaces further highlight the critical role of surface passivation in achieving superlubricity, and a &#8216;Passivation Driven SuperLubricity&#8217; (PDSL) design principle is proposed to describe this mechanism.








Abstract
Superlubricity with a friction coefficient &lt;0.01 holds great promise for reducing energy consumption and global CO2 emissions. However, current numerous innovative superlubricity techniques have persisted in specific materials, inert atmosphere or nano/micro&#8208;scale conditions. Here, a versatile and universal superlubricity strategy is demonstrated for common engineering alloys under atmospheric environment, and emphasize an innovative superlubricity design principle through surface passivation. Such superlubricity behavior is achieved by employing electrochemical boronizing surface treatment combined with liquid polyol/water mixture lubricants, revealing significant advances in terms of wide adaptability to traditional and newly&#8208;emerged alloy materials, high load capacity and high&#8208;temperature resistance (&#8776;125&#160;&#176;C). The atomistic simulations and experimental results demonstrate that the energy dissipation reduction and superlubricity are driven by the weak interaction between the confined lubricant molecules and &#9472;CxHy&#8208;terminated passivation tribofilm, which is in situ generated by the mechanochemical reaction between the boronized layer and the liquid lubricant. The role of passivation layer on driving superlubricity is further supported by the exceptionally super&#8208;low friction coefficient (COF&#8776;0.008) observed in octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) molecular layer coated surfaces. This advancement opens the door for developing industrial&#8208;scale superlubricity techniques and has the potential to accelerate their practical applications in engineering area.

         <title>Improving the Dynamic Stability of High&#8208;Efficiency Quantum Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes by Core&#8211;shell Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism behind the poor dynamic stability of quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes is revealed, and their dynamic stability is significantly improved through core&#8211;shell engineering of quantum dots. With over 10 000 voltage scanning cycles in the range of 0&#8211;2.6&#160;V, this advancement brings quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes closer to commercialization.








Abstract
Quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QD&#8208;LEDs) hold great potential for enabling ultra&#8208;clear and ultra&#8208;bright display technologies. Although the operational life of QD&#8208;LEDs under static conditions has reached commercial standards, their dynamic stability, i.e., performance consistency while being switched on and off, remains largely behind that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art III&#8208;V inorganic LEDs. In this work, the degradation mechanism of red&#8208;emitting CdZnSe/ZnSe QD&#8208;LEDs with high external quantum efficiency (EQE) and long static operating lifetime is studied. Surprisingly, it is found that the accelerated EQE decline is mainly due to the fast&#8208;increasing electron leakage into the organic hole transport layer (HTL) under continuous voltage scans. To improve the dynamic stability of QD&#8208;LEDs, these findings inspired us to refine the size and architecture of CdZnSe/ZnSe QDs by introducing a ZnSeS/ZnS outer shell, where the ZnS shell improves the electron confinement and the ZnSeS mitigates the lattice mismatch between ZnSe and ZnS. Consequently, the electron leakage into the HTL is significantly inhibited, leading to QD&#8208;LEDs with minimal EQE drop of &lt;4% after &gt;5000 voltage cycles within a 0&#160;&#8722;&#160;4.5&#160;V voltage range, while the devices still possessed excellent static stability, as their T95 at 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2 for over 61 000&#160;h.

         <title>Strong MXene Induced Conductive Silk Fibers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong MXene induced conductive silk fibers (MCSFs) are fabricated from inspiration of the core&#8208;sheath structure of Bombyx mori silks. The MCSFs with tensile strength of 1037.9 MPa and excellent electrical conductivity of 6400 S m&#8722;1, demonstrate multifunctional performance to monitor human pulse, body movements, and changes of ambient humidity in real time.








Abstract
Conductive silk fibers (CSFs) are attractive in the field of flexible wearable electronics and textiles, but it still exists a great challenge to simultaneously enhance the electrical conductivity and mechanical properties. Inspired by the core&#8208;sheath structure of Bombyx mori silks, a continuous strategy is demonstrated for the fabrication the strong MXene induced conductive silk fibers (MCSFs). The sericin sheath of silk fibers (SFs) is replaced by MXene/sodium alginate (MSA) layer, and the ultrathin sheath layer is tightly bridged with the core through strong interfacial interactions, including hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions. Therefore, the MCSFs show extraordinary tensile strength of 1037.9&#160;MPa and outstanding electrical conductivity of 6400 S m&#8722;1, which exhibits obvious advantages compared with the previous reported silk fibers modified by other methods. In addition, the MCSFs also have a high toughness of 194.9&#160;MJ m&#8722;3 and an ultra&#8208;sensitive gauge factor of 2269.3, resulting in their ability to monitor human pulse, body movements, and changes of ambient humidity in real time. The proposed bioinspired strategy for continuously fabricating ultra&#8208;strong and tough MCSFs provides an avenue for implementing functionalized silk fibers in next&#8208;generation wearable technologies, intelligent textiles, and human&#8208;machine interaction etc.

The MCSFs with tensile strength of 1037.9 MPa and excellent electrical conductivity of 6400 S m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, demonstrate multifunctional performance to monitor human pulse, body movements, and changes of ambient humidity in real time.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conductive silk fibers (CSFs) are attractive in the field of flexible wearable electronics and textiles, but it still exists a great challenge to simultaneously enhance the electrical conductivity and mechanical properties. Inspired by the core-sheath structure of &lt;i&gt;Bombyx mori&lt;/i&gt; silks, a continuous strategy is demonstrated for the fabrication the strong MXene induced conductive silk fibers (MCSFs). The sericin sheath of silk fibers (SFs) is replaced by MXene/sodium alginate (MSA) layer, and the ultrathin sheath layer is tightly bridged with the core through strong interfacial interactions, including hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions. Therefore, the MCSFs show extraordinary tensile strength of 1037.9&#160;MPa and outstanding electrical conductivity of 6400 S m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which exhibits obvious advantages compared with the previous reported silk fibers modified by other methods. In addition, the MCSFs also have a high toughness of 194.9&#160;MJ m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; and an ultra-sensitive gauge factor of 2269.3, resulting in their ability to monitor human pulse, body movements, and changes of ambient humidity in real time. The proposed bioinspired strategy for continuously fabricating ultra-strong and tough MCSFs provides an avenue for implementing functionalized silk fibers in next-generation wearable technologies, intelligent textiles, and human-machine interaction etc.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrafast Light&#8208;Driven Electronic and Structural Changes in LaFeO3 Perovskites Probed by Femtosecond X&#8208;Ray Absorption Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Femtosecond X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (fs&#8208;XAS) at PAL&#8208;XFEL captures ultrafast electronic and structural dynamics in epitaxial LaFeO3 thin films. Combined with DFT and multiplet calculations, the study reveals photoinduced ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer, followed by polaron formation and reduced oxygen 2p&#8208;iron 3d hybridization, explaining key spectral changes.








Abstract
Conducting real&#8208;time, element&#8208;specific studies of photo&#8208;excited systems is a long&#8208;standing challenge. The development of X&#8208;ray free&#8208;electron lasers (XFELs) has paved the way for the emergence of a promising technique: femtosecond X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (fs&#8208;XAS). This powerful technique reveals electronic and geometric characteristics, providing unprecedented insight into their dynamic interactions under nonequilibrium conditions. Herein, the&#160;fs&#8208;XAS technique is employed at PAL&#8208;XFEL to unravel light&#8208;driven ultrafast electronic and structural changes in epitaxial lanthanum iron oxide (LaFeO3) thin films. Density functional theory (DFT) and multiplet calculations are utilized to expound on the experimental results. The analyses reveal that photoexcitation initially induces high&#8208; and intermediate&#8208;spin Fe2+ states through ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT), followed by polaron formation. It is demonstrated that the reduced overlap between the oxygen 2p and iron 3d orbitals accounts for all experimental observations, including 1) the XAS shifts to lower energies, 2) the decrease in the crystal field splitting, and 3) the relatively larger shifts observed in the oxygen 1s XAS.

         <title>Explainable Artificial Intelligence Elucidates Synthesis&#8208;Structure&#8208;Property&#8208;Function Relationships in Nanostructured Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated data&#8208;driven and experimental workflow that maps synthesis&#8208;structure&#8208;property&#8208;function relationships in electrocatalytic oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution reactions is presented. The framework uncovers structural insights that reinforce established chemical principles and reveal properties beyond conventional understanding, highlighting the power of data science to find novel trends in catalytic data and guide experiments.








Abstract
Designing high&#8208;performance catalysts based on supported metal atoms and nanoparticles necessitates rigorous assembly control, which affects reactivity. Yet, attaining synthesis precision to discern catalyst speciation and properties remains challenging. This limitation is tackled by pioneering an eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methodology that combines a decision tree classifier and a random forest regressor sequentially to elucidate synthesis&#8208;structure&#8208;property&#8208;function relationships in nanostructured catalysts, exemplified for the oxygen evolution (OER) and hydrogen evolution (HER) reactions. The decision tree accurately predicts the formation of single atoms versus nanoparticles for 37 metals anchored on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon, identifying the metal's standard reduction potential and cohesive energy as determinants of speciation. The random forest regressor correlates the electrocatalytic performance of synthesized single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) to intrinsic properties, revealing a volcano&#8208;like relationship of current density with the electronegativity of the active site and metal&#8208;support interaction, providing insights beyond traditional adsorption energy descriptors. The integrated models are validated experimentally with an overall accuracy of over 80%, establishing user confidence. This XAI framework, adaptable to diverse synthetic protocols and material classes is a powerful tool to understand synthesis&#8208;structure&#8208;property&#8208;function relationships and promote data&#8208;informed experiments with reduced characterization efforts.

         <title>Polyanhydride&#8208;Based Microparticles for Programmable Pulsatile Release of Diphtheria Toxoid (DT) for Single&#8208;Injection Self&#8208;Boosting Vaccines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a polyanhydride&#8208;based delivery platform for single&#8208;injection, self&#8208;boosting vaccines. The system enables programmable, pulsatile release of diphtheria toxoid with high antigen recovery and is guided by machine learning for tunability. In vivo results show immune responses comparable to multi&#8208;dose regimens, highlighting its potential to improve vaccine accessibility and reduce under&#8208;immunization.








Abstract
Vaccination remains a critical tool in preventing infectious diseases, yet its effectiveness is undermined by under&#8208;immunization, particularly for vaccines requiring multiple doses that patients fail to complete. To address this challenge, the development of single&#8208;injection platforms delivering self&#8208;boosting vaccines has gained significant attention. Despite some advances, translating these platforms into clinical applications has been limited. In this study, a novel polyanhydride&#8208;based polymeric delivery platform is introduced, designed for single&#8208;injection self&#8208;boosting vaccines, replacing multiple doses. Over 20 polyanhydride polymers are synthesized and screened, ultimately down selecting to 6 for in vitro studies, and 2 for in vivo studies. Using diphtheria toxoid (DT) as a model antigen, programmed pulsatile release with a narrow window is demonstrated, ideal for self&#8208;boosting immunization. The platform effectively protects the pH&#8208;sensitive antigen before release, achieving recovery rate of 39.7% to 89.7%. The system's tunability is further enhanced by machine learning algorithms, which accurately predict release profiles, confirmed through experimental validation. In vivo studies in a mouse model reveals that the platform induces DT&#8208;specific antibody responses comparable to those generated by traditional multi&#8208;dose regimens. Collectively, these findings highlight the potential of this platform to deliver various vaccines, offering a potentially promising solution to the global challenge of under&#8208;immunization.

         <title>Radical TADF: Quartet&#8208;Derived Luminescence with Dark TEMPO</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of luminescent organic quantum materials is introduced, formed by attaching a stable radical to TADF chromophores. Due to ferromagnetic exchange coupling, a high&#8208;spin quartet state forms upon excitation, which can thermally access a bright state. &#8776;200&#160;nm tunability of the emission color is reported, and coherent spin manipulations with microwaves are achieved.








Abstract
High&#8208;spin states in organic molecules offer promising tuneability for quantum technologies. Photogenerated quartet excitons are an extensively studied platform, but their applications are limited by the absence of optical read&#8208;out via luminescence. Here, a new class of synthetically accessible molecules with quartet&#8208;derived luminescence is demonstrated, formed by appending a non&#8208;luminescent TEMPO radical to thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) chromophores previously used in OLEDs. The low singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap of the chromophore opens a luminescence channel from radical&#8208;triplet coupled states. A set of design rules is established by tuning the energetics in a series of compounds based on a naphthalimide (NAI) core. Generation of quartet states is observed and the strength of radical&#8208;triplet exchange is measured. In DMAC&#8208;TEMPO, up to 72% of detected photons emerge after reverse intersystem crossing from the quartet state repopulates the state with singlet character. This design strategy does not rely on a luminescent radical to provide an emission pathway from the high&#8208;spin state. The large library of TADF chromophores promises a greater pallet of achievable emission colours.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Soluble 1&#8208;Azaphenothiazine Additive Stabilizes High&#8208;Voltage LiCoO&#8322; for 500&#160;Wh Kg&#8722;1 Lithium Metal Pouch Cells</title>

The development of ultra&#8208;soluble 1&#8208;azaphenothiazine (1&#8208;APT) marks a significant advancement in additive chemistry for high&#8208;voltage LiCoO2 cathodes, surpassing traditional additives and facilitating large&#8208;scale battery production. Li||LiCoO2&#8208;1&#8208;APT pouch cells demonstrate impressive performance with specific energies of 515.7, 497.4, and 484.9 Wh kg&#8722;1 at discharge rates of 0.5C, 1C, and 2C, respectively.








Abstract
High&#8208;voltage LiCoO2 is a promising cathode candidate for achieving high&#8208;energy lithium metal pouch cells. However, further application is still hindered by irreversible structural degradation and severe interfacial side reactions that accelerate capacity decay. Herein, 1&#8208;Azaphenothiazine (1&#8208;APT) is incorporated as a cathode slurry additive (1&#160;g mL&#8722;1 in N&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyrrolidone) to promote the optimization of the LiCoO2 interface during the electrode coating process. The ultra&#8208;soluble 1&#8208;APT promotes the formation of inorganic&#8208;rich components within the cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase (CEI), mitigates the reaction of Co4+ with the electrolyte, and enhances the interfacial stability of LiCoO2, thereby enabling 4.7&#160;V LiCoO2 with an initial capacity of 229.8 mAh g&#8722;1 and 73.2% capacity retention after 200 cycles. More importantly, Li||LiCoO2&#8208;1&#8208;APT pouch cells exhibit remarkable electrochemical performance, achieving specific energies of 515.7&#160;, 497.4&#160;, and 484.9&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at discharge rates of 0.5C, 1C, and 2C, respectively. Notably, the 5 Ah pouch cell exhibited the capability to maintain an energy density of 411.4&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 after 100 cycles at 0.5C. This work presents a practical and effective strategy for optimizing cathode interfaces, thereby enabling the stabilization of high&#8208;voltage cathodes.

         <title>All&#8208;Optically Modulated In&#8208;Sensor Computing Device Based on Ionic&#8208;Conducting CuInP2Se6</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An all&#8208;optical in&#8208;sensor computing device is presented based on the unique optoelectronic and ion&#8208;conducting properties of two&#8208;dimensional material CuInP2Se6. Light intensity&#8208;adaptive modulation of ionic conductivity is achieved within the 400 to 700 nm wavelength range. This architecture provides a novel solution in RGB&#8208;noise image processing and recognition by leveraging the intricate ion&#8208;electron coupling effect.








Abstract
Inspired by the human visual system, in&#8208;sensor computing has emerged as a promising approach to address growing demands for real&#8208;time image processing while overcoming constraints in computational resources. However, existing in&#8208;sensor computing optoelectronic devices still face challenges such as complex heterostructures or limited optical modulation for operational efficiency, restricting their practical use. Here, a simple two&#8208;terminal optoelectronic device has been fabricated using the 2D material CuInP2Se6, achieving neuromorphic functionalities through all&#8208;optical modulation. The device exhibits a tunable photoresponse across the visible spectrum (400 to 700 nm) and enables bidirectional conductance modulation in response to light stimuli, driven by the interaction between Cu&#8314; ions and photogenerated electrons. It shows high linearity with 300 discrete conductance states under red, green, and blue light, enabling color&#8208;specific image feature extraction, processing, and recognition across three channels. This approach significantly enhances color image recognition accuracy by 4.6% when integrated with a three&#8208;channel convolutional neural network. Additionally, the bidirectional photoresponse allows for efficient noise suppression during color image preprocessing, leading to a 490% improvement in signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio. These findings highlight the potential of CuInP2Se6&#8208;based architecture for robust performance, paving the way for in&#8208;sensor neuromorphic vision systems in artificial intelligence and biomimetic computing.

         <title>Photothermal Nanotrigger Enables Rapid Gelation and Spatially&#8208;Programmable Printability Under Broad&#8208;Spectrum Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An original and generic concept of photothermal nanotrigger is proposed to transform inherently uncontrollable thermal initiation into spatially&#8208;programmable photoinitiation via the classic photothermal effect, conferring rapid gelation and spatially&#8208;programmable printability under broad&#8208;spectrum light. Unlike conventional small&#8208;molecule initiators that are normally consumed, photothermal nanotrigger can parasitize hydrogel networks as an additional functional medium to give some new functions or intensify the performance of hydrogels.








Abstract
Controllable and versatile manufacturing of nanocomposite hydrogels is highly desirable for attaining preferential performance and pushing their applications. However, the conventional thermal&#8208;initiated method suffers from sluggish and uncontrollable bulky gelation, whereas the photo&#8208;initiated method is controllable yet is limited by a special wavelength of light and is ineffective for hydrogel precursors containing light&#8208;absorbing conductive/magnetic nanomaterials. Herein, these limitations are fundamentally overcome, and a new concept of photothermal nanotrigger (PTNT) is discovered that leverages the classic photothermal effect of light&#8208;absorbing nanomaterials to transform uncontrollable thermal initiation into a new photo&#8208;controlled initiation. The design of PTNT is universal and can be extended for arbitrary photothermal nanomaterials from 2D nanosheets to 1D nanotubes and 0D nanoparticles, exhibiting high gelation efficiency and superior compatibility to broad&#8208;spectrum light from visible to ultraviolet and near&#8208;infrared. Intriguingly, the PTNT approach can be imparted with excellent spatially&#8208;programmable printability by introducing viscous and low thermally&#8208;conductive glycerol to confine the photothermal&#8208;generated heat and eliminate the diffusion of the formed free radicals to the unexposed region, enabling the manufacturing of high&#8208;resolution and heterogenous architecture. Moreover, in addition to the basic initiation function, the PTNT can parasitize the hydrogel network to find many additional applications in the fields of flexible electronics, light/magnetic&#8208;manipulated soft robotics, and beyond.

         <title>Multidimensional Modulation via&#160;Tailored Covalent Organic Frameworks Enables Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells with 26.21% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrazinelinked covalent organic framework (COF) is synthesized for the first time and integrated into perovskite for multidimensional regulation of crystallization, defect states, and charge separation, synergistically. Benefiting from the oriented crystallization, which eliminates defects, together with the optimized interfacial charge transfer, the optimal device achieves an excellent efficiency of 26.21% with greatly improved humidity, thermal, and illumination stabilities.








Abstract
Despite the remarkable advancements in inverted perovskite solar cells, their commercialization remains hindered by critical bottlenecks in efficiency and stability stemming from inadequate crystallization and unfavorable interfacial states. Herein, for the first time, a judiciously designed hydrazine&#8208;linked covalent organic framework (COF) with long alkane phosphate branch chains, named 12&#8208;SD&#8208;COF, is synthesized and integrated into the perovskite precursor to achieve multidimensional regulation of crystallization, defect states, and charge separation synergistically. It is found that the 12&#8208;SD&#8208;COF featuring periodic pores, large planar structure, and abundant binding groups is extruded from the precursor solution onto the buried interface, surface, and grain boundaries, facilitating oriented crystallization while eliminating defects of perovskites, thereby yielding high&#8208;quality crystals with suppressed non&#8208;radiative recombination. Simultaneously, the interfacial charge separation is synergistically facilitated by the p&#8208;type doping&#8208;optimized energy level alignment and the induced intramolecular electric field, ultimately achieving an exceptional power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.21%, the highest yet reported for COF&#8208;modified. Impressively, the non&#8208;encapsulated resultant device delivers greatly improved stabilities, with maintaining over 92% of initial PCE after being aged under 85&#160;&#176;C continuous heating stress for 800&#160;h, 1000&#160;h in 50&#177;3% relative humidity air, and 1200&#160;h under continuous 1&#8208;sun illumination, respectively.

         <title>Differential Optical Imaging of Antigen Presentation Machinery Using Molecular Optical Reporters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular optical reporters with fluorescence or chemiluminescence are synthesized to dynamically and noninvasively detect major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC&#8208;I) and MHC&#8208;II antigen presentations in lymph nodes. They are validated across cancer, bacterial, and viral models with high sensitivity and minimal signal crosstalk.








Abstract
Detection of antigen presentation is central to understanding immunological processes and developing therapeutics for cancer, infectious diseases, and allergies. However, methods with the ability to dynamically and noninvasively distinguish between major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC&#8208;I) and MHC&#8208;II antigen presentations remain lacking. Herein, we develop activatable molecular optical reporters (MORs) for real&#8208;time differential imaging of antigen presentations in lymph nodes (LNs). These MORs are engineered to passively target LNs and activated through proteolytic cleavage by key enzymes in the MHC&#8208;I and MHC&#8208;II pathways, the immunoproteasome (iP) and cathepsin S (CTSS), respectively, triggering their chemiluminescent or fluorescent signals. Coupled with minimized signal crosstalk and high sensitivity, MORs delineate the subtle differences in the antigen presentation machinery across various disease models, including cancer and bacterial or viral infection, a feat unattainable for existing imaging methods. After systemic administration, MORs also allow real&#8208;time visualization of antigen presentation in the tumor microenvironment. Besides, MORs are validated to have potential for preclinical application in immunotherapeutics screening and clinical application in tissue biopsy. Thus, our study not only presents the first example of real&#8208;time, in vivo differential imaging of antigen presentation pathways but also opens new avenues for optical probes in immune contexture analysis.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detection of antigen presentation is central to understanding immunological processes and developing therapeutics for cancer, infectious diseases, and allergies. However, methods with the ability to dynamically and noninvasively distinguish between major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) and MHC-II antigen presentations remain lacking. Herein, we develop activatable molecular optical reporters (MORs) for real-time differential imaging of antigen presentations in lymph nodes (LNs). These MORs are engineered to passively target LNs and activated through proteolytic cleavage by key enzymes in the MHC-I and MHC-II pathways, the immunoproteasome (iP) and cathepsin S (CTSS), respectively, triggering their chemiluminescent or fluorescent signals. Coupled with minimized signal crosstalk and high sensitivity, MORs delineate the subtle differences in the antigen presentation machinery across various disease models, including cancer and bacterial or viral infection, a feat unattainable for existing imaging methods. After systemic administration, MORs also allow real-time visualization of antigen presentation in the tumor microenvironment. Besides, MORs are validated to have potential for preclinical application in immunotherapeutics screening and clinical application in tissue biopsy.

         <title>Engineering Organic Photochromism with Photoactivated Phosphorescence: Multifunctional Smart Devices and Enhanced Four&#8208;Channel Data Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By engineering the interactions between the photochromic and phosphorescent components through covalent linking, the multifunctional device significantly enhances data storage density. Based on a pure organic film, the device exhibits exceptional flexibility and multifunctionality, enabling remote monitoring of acid gases and blue light radiation as well as the automatic control of blue light exposure.








Abstract
The development of organic photoresponsive materials with multiple responses is essential for advancing multichannel data storage systems. In this study, interactions between photochromic and phosphorescent components are engineered by covalently linking them to obtain NMC&#160;(the compound containing naphthalimide and merocyanine units), which converted into NSP (the compound containing naphthalimide and spiropyran units) upon blue light irradiation, resulting in a maximum decrease in absorption of more than 90%, a blueshift of the fluorescent emission peaks from 605 to 490&#160;nm, and an 84 fold enhancement in phosphorescence emission intensity. These significant optical changes across the three modes upon exposure to blue light are unprecedented. The conversion of optical signals to electrical signals enables the successful implementation of devices for remote monitoring of acid gas and blue light, as well as automatic control of blue light exposure. Furthermore, the data storage capacity of the device is significantly enhanced, increasing from 1 bit to log2(4n) bits per point in a four&#8208;channel data storage system. The design and synthesis of this compound present a promising approach for the development of sustainable, efficient, and flexible smart optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Cyclable Micron&#8208;Sized Silicon&#8208;Based Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries at &#8722;40 &#176;C Enabled by Temperature&#8208;Dependent Solvation Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The low&#8208;temperature cyclability of micron&#8208;sized silicon anodes is successfully achieved by leveraging temperature&#8208;adaptive ion&#8208;dipole interactions, where the remarkable CIPs&#8208;dominated solvation structure at low temperatures facilitates Li+ desolvation and the formation of a thin, robust SEI, thereby enabling an unprecedentedly high capacity of 786 mAh g&#8315;1 after 100 cycles at &#8211;40 &#176;C under 0.1 A g&#8315;1.









Abstract
Micron&#8208;sized silicon (&#181;Si) anodes hold great promise for high&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, the rechargeable cyclability of &#181;Si anodes at sub&#8208;zero Celsius, especially below &#8722;20 &#176;C remains challenging, caused by the severe volume change and cracking of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) during cycling. Here, the low&#8208;temperature cyclability of &#181;Si&#8208;based LIBs is realized by using an electrolyte featured with temperature&#8208;adaptive ion&#8208;dipole interactions. The synergistic effect of the methyl group as a weak electron donor and the electronegative fluorine atoms endows methyl difluoroacetate (MDFA) with a weak binding affinity for Li+. Moreover, the affinity between Li+ and the oxygen atoms in both MDFA and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) decreases at lower temperatures, accompanied by a temperature&#8208;responsive enhancement of Li+&#8208;anion coordination. Thus, the MDFA/FEC electrolyte exhibits an extraordinary contact ion pairs&#8208;dominated solvation structure at subzero temperatures, which facilitates Li+ desolvation and the formation of a thin, robust inorganic&#8208;rich SEI. As expected, &#181;Si anodes show a record&#8208;breaking capacity of 786 mAh g&#8722;1 after 100 cycles at &#8722;40 &#176;C under 0.1 A g&#8722;1, and &#181;Si&#8208;based full cells display impressive rechargeability at &#8722;40 &#176;C. This work paves the way for extending the applications of &#181;Si anodes to extreme cold conditions.

         <title>Ultrabroadband (Vis&#8208;NIR) Emission in Single&#8208;Component Perovskite LEDs via Tailored Multi&#8208;Exciton Energy Transfer Pathways</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A promising strategy is introduced by tailoring multi&#8208;exciton energy transfer pathways in Sb3&#8314;/Ln3&#8314; co&#8208;doped Cs&#8322;HfCl&#8326; nanocrystals to achieve ultrabroadband Vis&#8208;to&#8208;NIR emission. The resulting single&#8208;component Sb3&#8314;/Pr3&#8314; LED exhibits broadband emission up to &#8776;1200 nm, spectral quality (CRI &#8764;98.1, R9 &#8764;98), high PLQY (&gt;80%), and stable operation over 50 h.








Abstract
The development of ultrabroadband light sources spanning the visible (Vis) to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) range is of fundamental importance for cutting&#8208;edge applications in communication, metrology, and quantum technologies. Although phosphor&#8208;converted LEDs have extended emission, they still suffer from spectral gaps, inadequate color rendering, and constrained NIR output. Here, a promising approach is introduced by tailoring multi&#8208;exciton energy transfer pathways to realize ultrabroadband Vis&#8208;to&#8208;NIR emission in Sb3&#8314;/Ln3&#8314; co&#8208;doped vacancy&#8208;ordered Cs&#8322;HfCl&#8326; perovskite nanocrystals. By systematically optimizing Sb3&#8314; and Ln3&#8314; doping concentrations, excitation wavelengths, and lanthanide ion selection, the energy transfer pathways between singlet and triplet self&#8208;trapped exciton (STE) states and lanthanide energy levels are modulated. This design facilitates broad spectral tunability through energy distribution control among emission centers, improves radiative efficiency by reducing energy losses during transfer processes, and promotes stable performance by mitigating excessive energy accumulation. The resulting single&#8208;component LED based on Sb3&#8314;/Pr3&#8314; co&#8208;doped NCs delivers broadband emission extending to &#8776;1200 nm, high spectral quality (CRI &#8764; 98.1, R9 &#8764; 98), strong visible/NIR PLQY (&#8776;80%), and steady operation over 50 h. The findings provide insight into energy transfer engineering in low&#8208;dimensional perovskites and offer a viable route toward emerging ultrabroadband solid&#8208;state light sources.

         <title>Generalized Adaptive Cation&#8208;Selective Interfaces Exhibiting High Stability: Integrating Transduction Materials and Uniform Ion&#8208;Selective Membranes via One&#8208;Step Fabrication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An adaptive integrated interface structure coupling time&#8208;dependent solvent evaporation and spatial sedimentation of transduction material is customized using lipophilic molybdenum disulfide as ion&#8208;selective membrane (ISM) components, featuring a uniform ISM on top and transduction layers below. The interfacial mixed capacitance stability mechanism, driven by TFPB&#8722; surface adsorption, enhances the stability of general cation&#8208;selective electrodes and offers insights for sensing chip development.








Abstract
Rapidly advancing all&#8208;solid&#8208;state ion&#8208;selective electrodes are promising candidates as key components in intelligent biological and chemical sensors. Ionics sensing performance, essential for sensor stability and reliability, is influenced not only by interface compositions but by often&#8208;overlooked overall interface structures. This work develops a one&#8208;step adaptive integrated interface structure (AIIS) with high interfacial stability for analyzing general cations (K+, Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Pb2+, Cd2+, and Cu2+), showcasing exceptional near&#8208;Nernst response across wide linear ranges. AIIS, based on cetyltrimethylammonium&#8208;regulated lipophilic molybdenum disulfide (2.0 CTA&#8208;MoS2), forms single&#8208;piece ISM on top and bottom transduction layers over time due to THF volatilization in ISM solutions, ensuring performance adaptability. A kinetic model developed through electrochemical numerical simulation confirms the optimal theoretical stability of an AIIS based on maximum transduction layer charge current and minimal diffusion current. The mixed capacitive transduction mechanism driven by the adsorption of TFPB&#8722; on the 2.0 CTA&#8208;MoS2 surface is elucidated. Adaptive integrated cadmium ion&#8208;selective electrodes, as a case study, exhibit excellent interfacial stability (potential drift of 5.51 &#177; 0.32 &#181;V&#160;h&#8722;1 for 24&#160;h and sensitivity loss rate of 4.77% for 30 days) and selectivity. This study proposes a promising strategy for constructing extendable interface structures, providing valuable insights for advancing sensor chip development.

&lt;p&gt;An adaptive integrated interface structure coupling time-dependent solvent evaporation and spatial sedimentation of transduction material is customized using lipophilic molybdenum disulfide as ion-selective membrane (ISM) components, featuring a uniform ISM on top and transduction layers below. The interfacial mixed capacitance stability mechanism, driven by TFPB&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; surface adsorption, enhances the stability of general cation-selective electrodes and offers insights for sensing chip development.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rapidly advancing all-solid-state ion-selective electrodes are promising candidates as key components in intelligent biological and chemical sensors. Ionics sensing performance, essential for sensor stability and reliability, is influenced not only by interface compositions but by often-overlooked overall interface structures. This work develops a one-step adaptive integrated interface structure (AIIS) with high interfacial stability for analyzing general cations (K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Cd&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, and Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;), showcasing exceptional near-Nernst response across wide linear ranges. AIIS, based on cetyltrimethylammonium-regulated lipophilic molybdenum disulfide (2.0 CTA-MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), forms single-piece ISM on top and bottom transduction layers over time due to THF volatilization in ISM solutions, ensuring performance adaptability. A kinetic model developed through electrochemical numerical simulation confirms the optimal theoretical stability of an AIIS based on maximum transduction layer charge current and minimal diffusion current. The mixed capacitive transduction mechanism driven by the adsorption of TFPB&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; on the 2.0 CTA-MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; surface is elucidated. Adaptive integrated cadmium ion-selective electrodes, as a case study, exhibit excellent interfacial stability (potential drift of 5.51 &#177; 0.32 &#181;V&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for 24&#160;h and sensitivity loss rate of 4.77% for 30 days) and selectivity. This study proposes a promising strategy for constructing extendable interface structures, providing valuable insights for advancing sensor chip development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient Sn&#8208;Pb Perovskite Solar Cells Through Inhibiting Hole Accumulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here this study discovers that hole accumulation is an inevitable reason for Sn2+ oxidation in Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Basing on this, a non&#8208;planar hole transport layer of P3CT/Me&#8208;4PACz is designed. P3CT/Me&#8208;4PACz will form non&#8208;planar films with spikes penetrating perovskite bulk, inhibiting holes accumulation. Resulted PSCs exhibit &gt;24% efficiency with good stability, retaining 82% of initial efficiency after MPP tracking for 1000 h.








Abstract
Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite solar cells (PSCs) own the highest theoretical efficiency due to their ideal bandgap. However, the efficiency of Sn&#8208;Pb PSCs remains 22&#8211;23% at present, which is much lower than Pb&#8208;based PSCs. One key reason lies in the Sn2+ oxidation issue. Here, this study demonstrates that apart from well&#8208;known chemical environmental oxidation, photo&#8208;generated holes and their accumulation are also a critical factor for Sn2+ oxidation in Sn&#8208;Pb PSCs. To address this issue, a non&#8208;planar hole transport layer (HTL) of P3CT/Me&#8208;4PACz is designed through solution micelle regulation. P3CT/Me&#8208;4PACz will form a 3D HTL film with a spike&#8208;like structure penetrating Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite bulk to accelerate hole extraction, thus inhibiting holes accumulation and Sn2+ oxidation. Resulted Sn&#8208;Pb PSCs exhibit the highest efficiency of over 24% with good operational stability, retaining 82% of initial efficiency after continuous MPP tracking for 1000 h at an elevated temperature of 55&#160;&#176;C.

         <title>Recent Progress on Solar&#8208;Driven Interfacial Evaporation for Resource Recovery and Pollutant Removal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review systematically summarizes bioinspired solar&#8208;driven interfacial evaporation (SDIE) architectures that synergistically integrate membrane separation, adsorption, and photocatalytic processes. Beyond clean water production, the multifunctional SDIE expanded its potential as a pivotal platform for addressing interconnected challenges in resource reclamation and environmental sustainability.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven interfacial evaporation (SDIE) has emerged as a transformative technology for clean water generation by localizing solar&#8208;thermal energy conversion at the air&#8208;liquid interface. Beyond water production, recent advancements reveal its potential as a pivotal platform for addressing the challenges in resource reclamation and environmental sustainability. Drawing inspiration from plant transpiration mechanisms, particularly ion&#8208;selective absorption, long&#8208;distance transport, and bioactive enrichment, this review systematically examines bioinspired SDIE architectures that synergistically integrate membrane separation, adsorption, and photocatalytic processes. The recent progress is summarized across three tiers: 1) structural biomimetics replicating natural plants, 2) functional hybridization coupling complementary purification mechanisms, and 3) hierarchical integration of multi&#8208;process cascades. The review highlights the recent progress in material innovation and structure design to expand its function. Furthermore, implementation frameworks addressing interfacial engineering, process optimization, and system durability are proposed to bridge lab&#8208;scale prototypes with practical applications. The future prospects are also outlined for multifunctional SDIE technologies to address water&#8208;energy&#8208;resource interdependency, advancing their role in sustainable environmental management.

         <title>Decoding Chemo&#8208;Mechanical Failure Mechanisms of Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Battery Under Low Stack Pressure via Optical Fiber Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By FBG sensing the Li/electrolyte interfacial stress in solid&#8208;state battery, the Li metal anode failure reasons as dendrite&#8208;induced uneven stress distribution at electrode/electrolyte interface are disclosed. A Li&#8211;Sn composite anode is demonstrated effective in stabilizing the interface mechanics and the solid&#8208;state full cell performance at low stack pressures.








Abstract
All solid&#8208;state lithium (Li) metal batteries (ASSLBs) using ceramic&#8208;polymer hybrid solid electrolytes hold the promise for high&#8208;performance energy storage application, but they still suffer from the interfacial deterioration and dendritic Li penetration issues, particularly under low stack pressures. Therefore, understanding and mastering the underlying chemo&#8208;mechanical failure mechanisms become essential. Herein, the chemo&#8208;mechanical evolutions by operando monitoring the amplitude and heterogeneity of interfacial stress through an embedded optical fiber sensor are revealed. It is found that the uneven stripping/deposition of Li metal induces rapid and non&#8208;uniform stress growth at the interface, deteriorating interfacial contact with the Li&#8208;filament growth. Based on these insights, Li metal is replaced with an architectural lithium&#8208;tin anode, which demonstrates uniform stress and improved performance even under low stack pressure. This work not only offers a quantitative way to operando track the uniformity of interfacial stress but also provides critical insights into mastering the chemo&#8208;mechanics of ASSLBs.

         <title>In Situ Tailored Frustrated Lewis Pairs on Asymmetric Bi&#9472;Ov&#9472;In Motifs Domino&#8208;Direct High&#8208;Efficiency Urea Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A domino&#8208;oriented electrosynthesis strategy to access urea of unprecedented selectivity from CO2 and NO3&#8722; is implemented over a Bi&#8208;doped In2O3 catalyst with asymmetric Bi&#9472;Ov&#9472;In sites. The kinetically preferred NO3RR driving the tandem CO2 activation and C&#9472;N coupling by in situ tailored controllable SFLPs (Bi&#9472;Ov&#9472;In&#9472;NH2) to complete urea electrosynthesis does not involve CO2RR.








Abstract
The green urea synthesis via co&#8208;electrolysis of waste nitrate and CO2 is alluring but challenging, especially with insufficient selectivity caused by thermodynamic differences and kinetic mismatch between multi&#8208;step conversion processes. Here, a domino effect&#8208;oriented electrosynthesis strategy is showcased to steer cascade reactions in upgrading nitrate and CO2 toward urea of high selectivity on Bi&#8208;doped In2O3 with asymmetric oxygen vacancies (Ov). The conventionally arbitrary reaction mode can be vectored and re&#8208;customized by stable and cumulative *NH2 intermediates in situ derived from priority nitrate reduction reaction, which not only form surface frustrated Lewis pairs (SFLPs, Bi&#9472;Ov&#9472;In&#9472;NH2) with Bi Lewis acid sites to synergistically adsorb and activate CO2 but also provide more opportunities for sluggish C&#9472;N coupling, delivering an unprecedented urea Faradic efficiency of 80.2% and an impressive urea yield of 2.38 &#215; 103&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 mgcat.&#8722;1 at &#8722;0.4&#160;V versus RHE. The atomically dispersed Bi sites promote the protonation of *NO to form nucleophilic *NH2 intermediates, which can be stabilized in the electrophilic region mediated by asymmetric Ov, permitting two nucleophilic attacks to complete the C&#9472;N coupling. The domino modeling protocol via positioning a specific intermediate in situ tailors the parallel conversion process and may guide selectivity control of electrosynthesis.

         <title>Kg&#8208;Scale Synthesis of Ultrathin Single&#8208;Crystalline MOF/GO/MOF Sandwich Nanosheets with Elevated Electrochemical Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a scalable method for synthesizing ultrathin single&#8208;crystalline MOF/GO/MOF (MGM) sandwich nanosheets, utilizing graphene oxide (GO) as a structure&#8208;directing agent. The approach achieves kilogram&#8208;scale production with a 98.73% metal&#8208;based yield and demonstrates universality across various ligands. The optimized nanosheets exhibit superior electrochemical performance in aqueous basic zinc batteries, sodium&#8208;ion batteries, and oxygen evolution reactions.








Abstract
The scalable preparation of 2D ultrathin metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanosheets remains a significant challenge due to low stripping efficiency and susceptibility to agglomeration. Herein, a facile strategy is developed for the synthesis of 2D ultrathin single&#8208;crystal MOF/graphene oxide (GO)/MOF (MGM) sandwich&#8208;like nanosheets based on the Ni/Co&#8208;BDC MOF (BDC = 1,4&#8208;terephthalic acid), with GO serving as a structure&#8208;directing agent. Impressively, 1&#160;kg of MGM nanosheets can be obtained in a single batch with a metal&#8208;based yield of 98.73%. Furthermore, the universality of this strategy is implemented by the successful synthesis of three additional 2D ultrathin nanosheets: MGM7&#8208;ABDC, MGM7&#8208;FBDC, and MGM7&#8208;BPDC (metal = Ni, Co; ligands = 2&#8208;aminoterephthalic acid (2&#8208;ABDC), 2&#8208;fluoroterephthalic acid (2&#8208;FBDC), and 4,4&#8242;&#8208; biphenyl dicarboxylic acid (BPDC)). The as&#8208;prepared MGM7 nanosheets (Ni: Co ratio = 7:3) exhibit excellent electrochemical performance as the cathode for aqueous basic zinc battery (159.2&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1), anode for sodium&#8208;ion battery (SIB, 593.0&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 0.2 A g&#8722;1), and electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER, 224&#160;mV overpotential at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2), significantly outperforming both bulk MOFs and conventional MOF nanosheets. This work enables the scalable synthesis of 2D MOF nanosheets with enhanced properties for multiple applications.

         <title>Sandwich Engineering Advances Ductile Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative sandwich engineering is developed to realize n&#8208;type Ag2(S, Se)&#8208;Ag2Se ductile thermoelectric films, exhibiting a record&#8208;high thermoelectric performance near room&#8208;temperature among n&#8208;type ductile semiconductors. The as&#8208;fabricated in&#8208;plane F&#8208;TED achieves an exceptional power density of 26.5&#160;W m&#8722;2 at a temperature difference of 50 K, ranking among the highest for ductile TEDs, demonstrating promising application potential.








Abstract
Flexible thermoelectrics offer the possibility of utilizing human body heat to generate electricity, enabling self&#8208;powered wearable electronics. Ductile and plastic semiconductors are promising materials for flexible thermoelectrics due to their inherent ductility and tunable electrical properties. However, balancing ductility with high thermoelectric performance remains challenging, especially for n&#8208;type materials. Here, a novel n&#8208;type ductile Ag2(S, Se)&#8208;Ag2Se sandwich&#8208;like thermoelectric film is designed with different functional layers, where the Ag2(S, Se) core layer provides ductile deformation ability and low thermal conductivity, while epitaxially grown highly oriented Ag2Se shell layers ensure superior electrical transport performance. This architecture achieves a record high figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit near room&#8208;temperature range, 0.91 at 323 K, among n&#8208;type ductile semiconductors while preserving excellent flexibility. Additionally, a flexible in&#8208;plane device fabricated from this material delivers an exceptional power density of 26.5&#160;W m&#8722;2 at a temperature difference of 50 K, demonstrating its great application potential for wearable electronics. Importantly, such novel sandwich engineering can pave the way to alleviate the compromise between thermoelectric performance and ductility in inorganic semiconductors.

Geometric Design Strategy for Solid Electrolyte Interphase
In article number 2418773, Jong&#8208;Won Lee, Seungbum Hong, Nam&#8208;Soon Choi, and colleagues demonstrate that a solid electrolyte interphase enriched with small grains enhances Li+ ion transport by providing abundant pathways. Moreover, a soft&#8208;solvating environment improves the desolvation kinetics of solvated Li+ ions under fast&#8208;charging conditions. Additionally, replacing ethylene carbonate with isobutyronitrile enables a high discharge capacity during rapid charging while mitigating Li plating.

Interlocking Antiphase Boundary
In article number 2416616, Xi Shen, Jun Miao, Richeng Yu, and co&#8208;workers report a coupling phenomenon between the antiphase boundary (APB) and the 180&#176; ferroelectric domain wall in PbTiO3, which is referred to as the antiphase ferroelectric boundary (APFB). It also illustrates the potential applications of APFBs in PbTiO3 films due to the sharp, straight morphology and the coupling feature. AFPBs retain a high degree of similarity to conventional domain walls, which may serve as dividers of domains and could be used in promising strategy for miniaturizing ferroelectric devices.

         <title>Responsive Molecules for Organic Neuromorphic Devices: Harnessing Memory Diversification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Responsive molecules are essential for organic in&#8208;sensor computing devices. This Review highlights recent advances in thedesign, synthesis, and incorporation of electrically, optically, and magnetically responsive molecules in multifunctional synaptic perception devices endowedwith both nonvolatile and volatile memory diversification. By exploiting the multifunctional nature of molecular switches, complex logic operations can be accomplished, bringing molecule&#8208;based neuromorphic computing closer to become a real technology.








Abstract
In the brain, both the recording and decaying of memory information following external stimulus spikes are fundamental learning rules that determine human behaviors. The former is essential to acquire new knowledge and update the database, while the latter filters noise and autorefresh cache data to reduce energy consumption. To execute these functions, the brain relies on different neuromorphic transmitters possessing various memory kinetics, which can be classified as nonvolatile and volatile memory. Inspired by the human brain, nonvolatile and volatile memory electronic devices have been employed to realize artificial neural networks and spiking neural networks, respectively, which have emerged as essential tools in machine learning. Molecular switches, capable of responding to electrical, optical, electrochemical, and magnetic stimuli, display a disruptive potential for emulating information storage in memory devices. This Review highlights recent developments on responsive molecules, their interfacing with low&#8208;dimensional nanostructures and nanomaterials, and their integration into electronic devices. By capitalizing on these concepts, a unique account of neurotransmitter&#8208;transfer electronic devices based on responsive molecules with ad hoc memory kinetics is provided. Finally, future directions, challenges, and opportunities are discussed on the use of these devices to engineer more complex logic operations and computing functions at the hardware level.

         <title>Strategic Development of Memristors for Neuromorphic Systems: Low&#8208;Power and Reconfigurable Operation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review investigates technological trends in brain&#8208;inspired artificial reconfigurable memristors, as well as individual non&#8208;volatile and volatile devices, according to their operating principles and fabrication methods. It examines case studies of artificial neural network system implementations based on these devices, providing the latest comprehensive design guidelines from fundamentals to advanced systems.








Abstract
The ongoing global energy crisis has heightened the demand for low&#8208;power electronic devices, driving interest in neuromorphic computing inspired by the parallel processing of human brains and energy efficiency. Reconfigurable memristors, which integrate both volatile and non&#8208;volatile behaviors within a single unit, offer a powerful solution for in&#8208;memory computing, addressing the von Neumann bottleneck that limits conventional computing architectures. These versatile devices combine the high density, low power consumption, and adaptability of memristors, positioning them as superior alternatives to traditional complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (CMOS) technology for emulating brain&#8208;like functions. Despite their potential, studies on reconfigurable memristors remain sparse and are often limited to specific materials such as Mott insulators without fully addressing their unique reconfigurability. This review specifically focuses on reconfigurable memristors, examining their dual&#8208;mode operation, diverse physical mechanisms, structural designs, material properties, switching behaviors, and neuromorphic applications. It highlights the recent advancements in low&#8208;power&#8208;consumption solutions within memristor&#8208;based neural networks and critically evaluates the challenges in deploying reconfigurable memristors as standalone devices or within artificial neural systems. The review provides in&#8208;depth technical insights and quantitative benchmarks to guide the future development and implementation of reconfigurable memristors in low&#8208;power neuromorphic computing.

Abstract
Anisotropic microcarriers (AMs) have attracted increasing attention. Although significant efforts have been made to explore AMs with various morphologies, their full potential is yet to be realized, as most studies have primarily focused on materials or fabrication methods. A thorough analysis of the interactional and interdependent relationships between these factors is required, along with proposed countermeasures tailored for researchers from various backgrounds. These countermeasures include specific fabrication strategies for various morphologies and guidelines for selecting the most suitable AM for certain biomedical applications. In this review, a comprehensive summary of AMs, ranging from their fabrication methods to biomedical applications, based on the past two decades of research, is provided. The fabrication of various morphologies is investigated using different strategies and their corresponding biomedical applications. By systematically examining these morphology&#8208;dependent effects, a better utilization of AMs with diverse morphologies can be achieved and clear strategies for breakthroughs in the biomedical field are established. Additionally, certain challenges are identified, new frontiers are opened, and promising and exciting opportunities are provided for fabricating functional AMs with broad implications across various fields that must be addressed in biomaterials and biotechnology.

         <title>Cartilage&#8208;Adaptive Hydrogels via the Synergy Strategy of Protein Templating and Mechanical Training</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fabricated oriented chitosan nanofibrillar hydrogels (O&#8208;CN gels), via the synergy strategy of protein templating and mechanical training, achieve cartilage&#8208;like structure and mechanical performances, as well as high&#8208;water retention similar to cartilage. The resulting O&#8208;CN gels has excellent prospects in load&#8208;bearing cartilage engineering application.








Abstract
Cartilage, as a load&#8208;bearing tissue with high&#8208;water content, exhibits excellent elasticity and high strength. However, it is still a grand challenge to develop cartilage&#8208;adaptive biomaterials for replacement or regeneration of damaged cartilage tissue. Herein, protein templating and mechanical training is integrated to fabricate crystal&#8208;mediated oriented chitosan nanofibrillar hydrogels (O&#8208;CN gels) with similar mechanical properties and water content of cartilage. The O&#8208;CN gels with an &#8776;74 wt% water content exhibit high tensile strength (&#8776;15.4 MPa) and Young's modulus (&#8776;24.1 MPa), as well as excellent biocompatibility, antiswelling properties, and antibacterial capabilities. When implanted in the box defect of rat's tails, the O&#8208;CN gels seal the cartilage (annulus fibrosus) defect, maintain the intervertebral disc height and finally prevent the nucleus herniation. This synergy strategy of protein templating and mechanical training opens up a new possibility to design highly mechanical hydrogels, especially for the replacement and regeneration of load&#8208;bearing tissues.

         <title>Multimodal Finger&#8208;Shaped Tactile Sensor for Multi&#8208;Directional Force and Material Identification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A finger&#8208;shaped tactile sensor inspired by human fingers is developed, capable of simultaneous normal and shear force detection and 98.33% accurate material identification. Integrated into a robot hand and arm system, it enables real&#8208;time detection of gripping force, material identification, advancing haptic sensing in robotics.








Abstract
Multimodal tactile perception is crucial for advancing human&#8211;computer interaction, but real&#8208;time multidimensional force detection and material identification remain challenging. Here, a finger&#8208;shaped tactile sensor (FTS) based on the triboelectric effect is proposed, capable of multidirectional force sensing and material identification. The FTS is composed of an external material identification section and an internal force sensing section. Three materials are embedded into the surface of the silicone shell in the fingerpad, forming single&#8208;electrode sensors for material identification. In the force sensing section, the silicone shell's outer surface is coated with conductive silver paste as a shielding layer. The inner wall has four silicone microneedle arrays and a silicone bump, while five silver electrodes are coated on the internal polylactic acid skeleton. The components connect via interlocking structures near the fingernail, allowing localized contact and separation between the silicone shell and skeleton, enabling force direction detection through signals from the five electrodes. Additionally, the outer sensors achieve 98.33% accuracy in recognizing 12 materials. Furthermore, integrated into a robotic hand, the FTS enables real&#8208;time material identification and force detection in an intelligent sorting environment. This research holds great potential for applications in tactile perception for intelligent robotics.

         <title>Visible Periodic Piezoelectric Domains in Silk Fibroin for Neurite&#8208;Orientated Extension</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The piezoelectric SF film with visible periodic piezoelectric domains and excellent biocompatibility is fabricated through a feasible photochemical method with silver nanoparticles as the developer and mediator simultaneously. Consequently, the oriented piezoelectric electric field is achieved under ultrasound and effectively regulates the directional growth and length of neurite and neural gene expression.








Abstract
The development of visible periodic piezoelectric domains is highly attractive but challenging to overcome the homogeneous distribution and lack of visualization of the electric field on traditional piezopolymers. This work reports an in situ synthesis to create customized silver patterns with micron&#8208;level distinguishability. This method serves to form visible periodic piezoelectric domains and endows the silk fibroin (SF) piezoelectric generator with maximum root mean square current, energy density, and voltage of 5.1&#160;mA, 6.7&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;2 and 529.5&#160;mV, respectively, under an ultrasound intensity of 1.0&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2. The oriented piezoelectric electric field is periodically distributed into the SF film with ultrasound&#8208;driven assistance and remarkably regulates neurite directional growth, length, and gene expression. Additionally, these piezoelectric domains enable the direct and timely observation of the electric field's effect on neurites by biological microscopy. This approach paves the way for great potential in tailored electric stimulation for cell biology and medical engineering.

         <title>Eye&#8208;Drop Nano&#8208;Formulation of Catalase Self&#8208;Assembled with Thiolated Chitosan for Effective Treatment of Dry Eye Disease</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An eye&#8208;drop nano&#8208;formulation of catalase self&#8208;assembled with cysteine&#8208;modified chitosan is designed. The obtained nanoparticles after eye&#8208;drop administration could form disulfide bonds with the mucin layer of the team film to achieve enhanced precorneal adhesion, so as to continuously eliminate excessive reactive oxygen species accumulated in the ocular surface to suppress inflammation, resulting in effective treatment of dry eye disease.








Abstract
Dry eye disease (DED), the most prevalent ophthalmological condition worldwide, can cause severe ocular discomfort and even visual impairment. Effective yet safe therapeutics for severe DED are still highly demanded. Herein, considering the important role of excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) in triggering DED, an eye&#8208;drop nano&#8208;formulation of catalase (CAT) self&#8208;assembled with cysteine&#8208;modified chitosan (CS&#8208;Cys) is designed for DED treatment. Upon eye&#8208;drop administration of CS&#8208;Cys/CAT nanoparticles, CS&#8208;Cys can form disulfide bonds with abundant thiols in the mucin layer of the tear film, anchoring catalase to the corneal surface. Thus the excess ROS accumulated on the ocular surface can be effectively eliminated, resulting in a regulated tear microenvironment. In mouse and rabbit models, it is verified that CS&#8208;Cys/CAT eye drops can offer excellent therapeutic effects, especially in promoting the recovery of damaged epithelium and increasing tear secretion. Remarkably, CS&#8208;Cys/CAT eye drops showed notably better therapeutic performance than clinically used cyclosporin and dexamethasone, as well as several new DED drugs in clinical trials. Thus, the work presents a unique nanoparticulate eye&#8208;drop&#8208;based ocular delivery system to allow prolonged ocular retention of protein therapeutics, and such nanoformulation formulated by fully biocompatible/biodegradable components possesses significant translational potential for effective and safe DED treatment.

         <title>Magneto&#8208;Ionic Engineering of Antiferromagnetically RKKY&#8208;Coupled Multilayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Artificial antiferromagnetically coupled multilayered heterostructures with tailored interlayer exchange interactions and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy hold great promise for applications such as magnetic random&#8208;access memory, magnetic sensors, and spintronics. Voltage&#8208;driven ion migration (i.e., magneto&#8208;ionics) enables post&#8208;synthesis tuning of these magnetic stacks, allowing significant modulation of the various switching events and transitions between antiferromagnetic (AFM) and ferrimagnetic (FiM) states.








Abstract
Voltage&#8208;driven ion motion offers a powerful means to modulate magnetism and spin phenomena in solids, a process known as magneto&#8208;ionics, which holds great promise for developing energy&#8208;efficient next&#8208;generation micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;electronic devices. Synthetic antiferromagnets (SAFs), consisting of two ferromagnetic layers coupled antiferromagnetically via a thin non&#8208;magnetic spacer, offer advantages such as enhanced thermal stability, robustness against external magnetic fields, and reduced magnetostatic interactions in magnetic tunnel junctions. Despite its technological potential, magneto&#8208;ionic control of antiferromagnetic coupling in multilayers (MLs) has only recently been explored and remains poorly understood, particularly in systems free of platinum&#8208;group metals. In this work, room&#8208;temperature voltage control of Ruderman&#8211;Kittel&#8211;Kasuya&#8211;Yosida (RKKY) interactions in Co/Ni&#8208;based SAFs is achieved. Transitions between ferrimagnetic (uncompensated) and antiferromagnetic (fully compensated) states is observed, as well as significant modulation of the RKKY bias field offset, emergence of additional switching events, and formation of skyrmion&#8208;like or pinned domain bubbles under relatively low gating voltages. These phenomena are attributed to voltage&#8208;driven oxygen migration in the MLs, as confirmed through microscopic and spectroscopic analyses. This study underscores the potential of voltage&#8208;triggered ion migration as a versatile tool for post&#8208;synthesis tuning of magnetic multilayers, with potential applications in magnetic&#8208;field sensing, energy&#8208;efficient memories and spintronics.

         <title>A High&#8208;Rate and Ultrastable Ammonium Ion&#8208;Air Battery Enabled by the Synergy of ORR and NH4+ Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores the synergistic interplay between oxygen reduction reaction and NH4+ storage, and harnesses the synergy for the successful development of a high&#8208;rate and highly stable ammonium ion air battery (AIAB). The assembled AIAB demonstrates outstanding rate performance (89 mAh g&#8722;1 at 15 A g&#8722;1), high energy density (78 Wh kg&#8722;1 at 9369 W kg&#8722;1), and exceptional cycling stability at 10 A g&#8722;1.








Abstract
Ammonium ion batteries (AIBs) offer cost&#8208;effectiveness, nontoxicity, and eco&#8208;friendly attributes in energy storage technology. However, the constrained capacity and poor stability of conventional cathode materials have impeded their widespread adoption. Herein, a synergistic approach is introduced to overcome these challenges, by enhancing the air cathode with NH4+ and simultaneously leveraging atmospheric oxygen as a reservoir for NH4+ storage. Notably, NH4+ significantly enhances the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance in neutral environments. Through in situ Raman spectroscopy and quantum density functional theory calculations, it is elucidated how NH4+ can act as a proton donor, replacing H2O in neutral media and reducing energy barriers in the protonation of *O2&#8722; and *O, thereby accelerating ORR kinetics. The resulting ammonium ion&#8208;air battery, comprising an air cathode and a polymer (PNP) anode, showcases impressive metrics: high energy density of 78 Wh kg&#8722;1 and power density of 9369 W kg&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1, an initial capacity of 94.3 mAh g&#8722;1 and exceptional cycling stability (70.4% capacity retention after 12&#160;500 cycles) at 10 A g&#8722;1. This pioneering research highlights the synergistic relationship between ORR and NH4+ storage and opens up new avenues for the design and advancement of innovative, sustainable, and environment&#8208;friendly AIBs.

         <title>Interlocking Antiphase Boundary with 180&#176; Domain Wall in PbTiO3 &#8211; Antiphase Ferroelectric Boundary</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores the potential applications of antiphase ferroelectric boundaries (APFBs) in PbTiO3 films due to the sharp, straight morphology and the interlocking feature between antiphase boundaries and 180&#176; conventional domain walls. AFPBs retain a high degree of similarity to conventional domain walls, which may serve as dividers of domains and be used in promising strategy for miniaturizing ferroelectric devices.








Abstract
The ferroelectric domain wall, serving as the boundary between separate data carriers based on domains, has attracted widespread interest due to its distinctive physical properties. Although the domain walls in ferroelectric materials are narrower than those in magnetic materials due to their higher lattice anisotropy, they still account for a considerable proportion in ultrathin films, reducing storage efficiency to some extent. Here, ultrathin antiphase ferroelectric boundaries (APFBs) are presented and validated their feasibility as ferroelectric domain walls. The naturally formed APFB shows a sharp and straight morphology, with the characteristic of interlocking between the antiphase boundary (APB)&#160;and conventional 180&#176; domain wall. The calculations from the density functional theory demonstrate that the APFBs undergo a significant but localized change in electronic structure. They largely retain the characteristics that are consistent with those of conventional domain walls, such as enhanced conductivity, irregular oxygen vacancy trapping energy, and vacancy&#8208;tunable physical properties. Finally, as techniques for precisely controlling the nucleation of APB developing, configurations with out&#8208;of&#8208;plane APFBs used as dividers may provide a promising strategy for miniaturizing ferroelectric devices.

         <title>Twist&#8208;Angle Controllable Transfer of 2D Materials via Water Vapor Intercalation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This is a quasi&#8208;dry transfer technique assisted by water vapor intercalation (WVI), which can be effectively used to fabricate high&#8208;quality twisted heterostructures, including monolayer/few&#8208;layer graphene and 2D quasicrystal&#8208;like heterostructure. It also enables the fabrication of suspended 2DMs and high&#8208;performance devices. This technique features excellent scalability, advancing fundamental research on 2DMs, and the fabrication of quantum devices with outstanding performance.









Abstract
Transfer technique has become an indispensable process in the development of two&#8208;dimensional materials (2DMs) and their heterostructures, as it determines the quality of the interface and the performance of the resulting devices. However, how to flexibly and conveniently fabricate two&#8208;dimensional (2D) twisted heterostructures with high&#8208;quality interfaces has always been a formidable challenge. Here, a quasi&#8208;dry transfer technique assisted by water vapor intercalation (WVI) is developed, which can be flexibly used to fabricate twisted heterostructures. This method leverages a charged hydrophilic surface to facilitate WVI at the interface, enabling the clean and uniform detachment of 2DMs from the substrate. Using this method, the twisted monolayer/few&#8208;layer graphene and 2D quasicrystal&#8208;like WS2/MoS2, highlighting the surface/interface cleanness and angle&#8208;controlled transfer method is successfully fabricated. Besides, suspended structures of these 2DMs and heterostructures are fabricated, which offers substantial convenience for studying their intrinsic physical properties. Further, a high&#8208;performance hBN/graphene/hBN superlattice device with the mobility of &#8776;199,000&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 at room temperature is fabricated. This transfer technique ingeniously combines the advantages of dry transfer and wet transfer. Moreover, it features excellent scalability, providing crucial technical support for future research on the fundamental physical properties of 2DMs and the fabrication of quantum devices with outstanding performance.

         <title>Localized and Controllable Mineral Salts Crystallization Enabled by Dye Modified Gold Nanorods with Enhanced Photothermal Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid materials with enhanced photostability and photothermal properties are prepared by modifying gold nanorods with tailored organic dyes, where plasmonic thermalization and nonradiative relaxation are effectively combined. Using the materials as a reusable energy converter, localized, and controllable photothermal crystallization of biorelevant mineral salts, including NaCl, CaCO3, BaCO3, and SrCO3, is realized using 638 nm laser light.








Abstract
Well&#8208;designed nanomaterials with favorable photothermal performance are beneficial for exploring fascinating and prospective applications. Herein the facile and effective way is reported to enhance photothermal properties of gold nanorods (GNRs) through immobilizing tailored organic dyes around GNRs. Benefitting from the combination of plasmonic thermalization and nonradiative relaxation, the modified GNRs exhibit a temperature increase of &gt;100&#160;&#176;C under 638&#160;nm laser irradiation in film state, which is double of that of the bare GNRs&#8208;doped film under the same condition. The hybrid film also exhibits superior stability and reusability compared to the film only doped with the dyes. Surface temperature of the hybrid film can be adjusted from 31 to 116&#160;&#176;C by tunning either doping materials concentration or light power. Interestingly, the hybrid film serves as a reusable energy converter in confined and controllable photothermal crystallization of mineral salts. NaCl crystals can be arranged into different patterns by moving the laser probe during the crystallization. Microcrystals of CaCO3 (calcite, vaterite, and aragonite), BaCO3, and SrCO3 are successfully obtained. It is believed that the as&#8208;prepared materials as well as the demonstrated photothermal crystallization will contribute to the development of function&#8208;led photothermal materials.

         <title>Hetero&#8208;Trimetallic Atom Catalysts Enable Targeted ROS Generation and Redox Signaling for Intensive Apoptosis and Ferroptosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A typical paradigm to utilize hetero&#8208;trimetallic atom catalysts (CCF TACs@NVs) with a stable symmetrical pyramid structure for catalytic guided apoptosis and ferroptosis&#8208;induced cell death, which is provided by the multi&#8208;enzymes like abilities under effective tumor aggregation, highlighting the application prospects in the biomedical field.








Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play crucial roles in cellular metabolic processes by acting as primary intracellular chemical substrates and secondary messengers for cellular signal modulation. However, the artificial engineering of nanozymes to generate ROS is restricted by their low catalytic efficiency, high toxicity, and off&#8208;target consumption. Herein, hetero&#8208;trimetallic atom catalysts (TACs) anchored on a stable symmetrical pyramid structure are designed in the presence of N and P surface ligands from cross&#8208;linked polyphosphazene interlayer&#8208;coated MIL&#8208;101(Fe). The 3D network TACs with a uniform dispersion of Cu, Co, and Fe hetero&#8208;single atoms effectively tailor the active sites to avoid metal sintering, thereby providing sufficient catalytic activity for ROS blooms. Nanovesicle membranes facilitate the stable accumulation of nanozymes with homologous targeting, recognition, and endocytosis, effectively addressing the potentially high toxicity and off&#8208;target defects. Therefore, the outcome of the in situ ROS&#8208;bloom acts as a redox signal for directly regulating oxidative stress in the tumor microenvironment. Meanwhile, ROS intervene in the glutathione peroxidase 4, long&#8208;chain acyl&#8208;CoA synthetase 4, and cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase&#8208;3 pathways as second messengers, fostering the proclivity toward apoptosis and lipid peroxidation&#8208;regulated ferroptosis pathway concurrently, thereby highlighting the application prospects of TACs in the biomedical field.

         <title>Multicolor Rare&#8208;Earth Film with Ultra&#8208;Long Afterglow for Diverse Energy&#8208;Saving Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study fabricates a large&#8208;area multicolor rare&#8208;earth afterglow film via electrospinning, integrating ZnS and tricolor rare&#8208;earth phosphors to achieve ultra&#8208;long afterglow (&gt;30 h) and tunable emissions. The film exhibits thermoluminescence, environmental stability, and light&#8208;capturing capabilities, enabling applications in fire&#8208;rescue gear, greenhouses, and energy&#8208;efficient tunnel/garage lighting. Its scalable production and cost&#8208;effectiveness advance energy&#8208;saving technologies in agriculture, safety, and urban infrastructure.








Abstract
Rare&#8208;earth afterglow materials, with their unique light&#8208;storage properties, show great promise for diverse applications. However, their broader applicability is constrained by challenges such as poor solvent compatibility, limited luminescent efficiency, and monochromatic emissions. In this study, these limitations are addressed by blending ZnS with various rare&#8208;earth phosphors including (Sr0.75Ca0.25)S:Eu2+; SrAl2O4:Eu2+, Dy3+ and Sr2MgSi2O7:Eu2+, Dy3+ to modulate deep trap mechanisms and significantly enhance both the afterglow and light capture capabilities. Using electrospinning, a large&#8208;area (0.4&#160;m &#215; 3&#160;m) afterglow film is successfully fabricated with tunable colors and an extended afterglow duration exceeding 30 h. This film demonstrates thermoluminescence, enabling potential integration into fire&#8208;rescue protective clothing for enhanced emergency visibility. In greenhouse settings, it effectively supports chlorophyll synthesis and optimizes conditions for plant growth over a 24&#8208;h cycle. For tunnel and garage applications, the film captures and stores light from vehicle headlights at distances of up to 70 meters. The scalability and cost&#8208;effectiveness of this afterglow film underscore its considerable potential for real&#8208;world applications across multiple fields, marking a significant advancement in sustainable illumination technology.

         <title>Revisiting the &#8220;Stick&#8208;Slip&#8221; Process via Magnetism&#8208;Coupled Flexible Sensors with Bioinspired Ridge Architecture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sandwich&#8208;like device for stick&#8208;slip perception is developed, featuring a deformable bioinspired ridge layer with capability of lateral deformation and fast recovery. Coupled with magnetized functionality, the morphological transformation is capable to induce periodical electrical pulses which allows to revisit the stick&#8208;slip process when human fingertip scans across a specific surface.








Abstract
&#8220;Stick&#8208;slip&#8221; phenomenon that occurs when human fingertip scans across a specific surface is essential to perceive the interactions between skin and the surface. Understanding the &#8220;stick&#8208;slip&#8221; behavior is important for bionic flexible system in applications from advanced robotics to intelligent tactile sensors. However, it is often overlooked owing to the limitations to mimic the soft skin that can tangentially deform/recover with informative electrical feedback. Here, a sandwich&#8208;type device with deformable ridge&#8208;layer is proposed to analyze the characteristic of stick/slip states in &#8220;stick&#8208;slip&#8221; process. Specifically, it is observed that fast recovery of the sensing architecture is caused by dynamic slip phase that generates periodical signals based on principle of induction. The results experimentally show that periods of the electrical pulses are dependent on factors such as inherent properties (e.g., modulus and geometry) and operational parameters (e.g., scanning speed and normal load), which is consistent with the theoretical model. Furthermore, it is found that the transition between &#8220;stick&#8208;slip&#8221; and full slip could qualitatively reflect interfacial properties such as moisture, roughness, and topology. It is expected that the results can strengthen the understanding of &#8220;stick&#8208;slip&#8221; behavior when fingertip interacts with a surface and provide guidance of flexible sensor design to enrich the biomimetic perceptions.

         <title>Geometric Design of Interface Structures and Electrolyte Solvation Chemistry for Fast Charging Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small&#8208;grain&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) geometry can provide sufficient paths for excellent Li+ ion supply capacity, and a soft&#8208;solvating electrolyte can enhance the desolvation kinetics of solvated Li+ ions under fast charging conditions. Isobutyronitrile&#8208;based electrolytes provide high discharge capacity during fast charging cycles while mitigating lithium plating on the anode.








Abstract
The grain sizes of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and solvation structure of electrolytes can affect Li+ ion transport across SEI and control the desolvation kinetics of solvated Li+ ions during fast&#8208;charging of Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, the impact of the geometric structure of SEI grains on the fast charging capability of LIBs is rarely examined. Here, the correlation between the SEI grain size and fast charging characteristics of cells is explored, and the desolvation kinetics is controlled by replacing the strongly binding ethylene carbonate (EC) solvent with a weakly binding nitrile&#8208;based solvent under fast charging conditions. The evolution of small grains of SEI to provide sufficient paths for Li+ ion supply can be achieved by the modification of solvation structure in the electrolyte. Additionally, the less resistive SEI composition and low viscosity of isoBN&#8208;containing electrolyte enable a more rapid charging of LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2/graphite full cells by facilitating the SEI crossing of Li+ ions with less Li plating at a charging rate of 4 C at 25 &#176;C. This work sheds light on solvation structure and interface engineering to enhance the fast charging cycle stability of LIBs for tailorable adoption in transportation sectors.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;Up Selective Growth of Ultralong Organic Phosphorescence Nanocrystals with Optimized Crystal Forms for In Vivo Optical Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) nanocrystals have attracted great attention in the field of in vivo optical imaging due to their ability to effectively minimize the interference of fluorescence background from biological tissues. In this work, a bottom&#8208;up strategy is proposed for preparing UOP nanocrystals with different crystal forms for in vivo biological imaging.








Abstract
Ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) materials are valuable for biological imaging to avoid interference from fluorescence background signals because of their delayed emission property. Obtaining nanocrystals with high phosphorescence quantum yield is a critical factor to achieve high&#8208;quality UOP imaging. Herein, a pair of host&#8211;guest UOP doped system with variable crystal forms for the host is constructed. By exploring the relationship between the crystal form of the host and the UOP of the doped system, the importance of host crystal form is revealed to achieve high quantum yield UOP in doped systems. Furthermore, to overcome the low crystallinity and numerous defects faced by traditional bottom&#8208;up strategies for nanocrystal preparation, a strategy is proposed for the selective preparation of nanocrystals with the target crystal form. Through controlling the evaporation rate of the solvent, the ordered growth of crystals can be effectively regulated to obtain nanocrystals with different crystal forms for bioimaging applications.

         <title>Synthetic Active Liquid Crystals Powered by Acoustic Waves</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully synthetic active liquid crystal, energized by an acoustic field, is presented. This system exhibits active nematic behavior, tunable topological defect dynamics, and persistent hydrodynamic vortices at high activity levels. The material maintains stable properties while enabling precise activity control in a wide range.








Abstract
Active nematic materials combine orientational order with activity at the microscopic level. Current experimental realizations of active nematics include vibrating elongated particles, cell layers, suspensions of elongated bacteria, and a mixture of bio&#8208;filaments with molecular motors. The majority of active nematics are of biological origin. The realization of a fully synthetic active liquid crystal comprised of a lyotropic chromonic liquid crystal energized by ultrasonic waves, is reported. This synthetic active liquid crystal is free from biological degradation and variability, exhibits phenomenology associated with active nematics, and enables precise and rapid activity control over a significantly extended range. It is demonstrated that the energy of the acoustic field is converted into microscopic extensile stresses disrupting long&#8208;range nematic order and giving rise to an undulation instability and proliferation of topological defects. The emergence of unconventional free&#8208;standing persistent vortices in the nematic director field at high activity levels is revealed. The results provide a foundation for the design of externally energized active liquid crystals with stable material properties and tunable topological defect dynamics crucial for the realization of reconfigurable microfluidic&#160;systems.

         <title>1D Magnetic Topological Inorganic Electrides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of 1D stable magnetic inorganic electrides are identified by high throughput screening and experimental synthesis. Furthermore, these 1D inorganic electrides exhibit various applications, including spintronics, topological electronics, low work function, electron emission, and high&#8208;performance catalysts for NH3 reductions.








Abstract
Inorganic electrides, which are characterized by the presence of interstitial anionic electrons (IAEs) within distinct geometric cavities, exhibit unique properties and have garnered significant attention in various fields. Nevertheless, inorganic electrides face significant challenges in terms of their stability and magnetic topological states. To address these issues, a combination of high&#8208;throughput screening, first&#8208;principles calculations, and experimental synthesis is used to identify a series of stable 1D magnetic topological inorganic electrides with diverse properties and applications. Specifically, 17 ferromagnetic (FM) and 19 antiferromagnetic (AFM) 1D inorganic electrides, with different topological bulk and surface states are reported. Moreover, these 1D inorganic electrides exhibit lower work functions (&#8776;3&#160;eV) on the (001) surface, significantly enhancing their applications in ammonia synthesis. Further experimental synthesis and characterization suggested that 1D inorganic electrides exhibit extremely high stability owing to the strong hybridization between IAEs and atoms and the small surface area of IAEs. These findings involve the screening, investigation, preparation, and application of stable 1D magnetic topological inorganic electrides, heralding a new era in the study of 1D inorganic electrides in topological quantum science, spintronics, energy, and the corresponding interdisciplinary areas.

         <title>LiC6@Li as a Promising Substitution of Li Metal Counter Electrode for Low&#8208;Temperature Battery Evaluation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work developed a LiC6@Li counter electrode, as an alternative to Li metal for more precisely evaluating the electrochemical behavior of electrode materials at low temperatures. The low interfacial resistances facilitate preferential de&#8208;intercalation of Li+ from LiC6, resulting in a sharp decreased over&#8208;potential at low temperatures. Meanwhile, the rapid replenishment of Li+ through the solid&#8211;solid&#8208;connection reaction maintains stable LiC6@Li potential.








Abstract
Li metal, as a counter electrode, is widely used for electrode materials evaluation in coin type half&#8208;cells. However, whether this configuration is suitable for different working conditions has often been neglected. Herein, the large resistance and high cathodic/anodic over&#8208;potential of Li metal at low temperature are highlighted, revealing its incompetence as counter electrode on cryogenic condition. In view of this, a novel LiC6@Li composite electrode is developed as a promising substitution for electrode materials evaluation. In the LiC6@Li electrode, Li+ de&#8208;intercalated from LiC6 preferentially due to the low interface resistance of LiC6, presenting a cathodic/anodic over&#8208;potential of 0.05&#160;V (67&#160;&#181;A cm&#8722;2) at &#8722;20 &#176;C, which is ten times lower than that of Li metal. Moreover, the rapid lithium replenishment into LiC6 from Li metal enables a stable potential of LiC6@Li. Consequently, the LiC6@Li&#8208;based half&#8208;cells enabled more precise evaluation of the Li+ storage potential and specific capacities of a series of electrode materials at low temperature. As an extension, KC8@K is also successfully prepared as a superior counter electrode to K metal. This work proposes a suitable counter electrode for more accurately evaluating electrode materials at subfreezing scenarios, demonstrating the necessity of specialized electrode evaluation systems for particular operating conditions.

Moreover, the rapid lithium replenishment into LiC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; from Li metal enables a stable potential of LiC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;@Li. Consequently, the LiC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;@Li-based half-cells enabled more precise evaluation of the Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; storage potential and specific capacities of a series of electrode materials at low temperature. As an extension, KC&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;@K is also successfully prepared as a superior counter electrode to K metal. This work proposes a suitable counter electrode for more accurately evaluating electrode materials at subfreezing scenarios, demonstrating the necessity of specialized electrode evaluation systems for particular operating conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hot&#8208;Exciton&#8208;Involved Dual&#8208;Channel Stepwise Energy Transfer Enabling Efficient and Stable Blue OLEDs with Narrow Emission and High Luminance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tailor&#8208;made blue organic emitter with hot exciton and aggregation&#8208;induced emission characteristics serves as a sensitizer in the innovative sensitizing system with a dual&#8208;channel stepwise energy transfer feature. The established material and device approach enables efficient, stable blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes with narrow emission and low&#8208;efficiency roll&#8208;off at high luminance.








Abstract
Marching toward next&#8208;generation ultrahigh&#8208;definition and high&#8208;resolution displays, the development of high&#8208;performance blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with narrow emission and high luminance is essential and requires conceptual advancements in both molecular and device design. Herein, a blue organic emitter is reported that exhibits hot&#8208;exciton and aggregation&#8208;induced emission characteristics, and use it as a sensitizer in the proposed triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation (TTA)&#8208;assisted hot&#8208;exciton&#8208;sensitized fluorescence (HSF) device, abbreviated THSF. Results show that through dual&#8208;channel stepwise F&#246;rster and Dexter energy transfer processes, the THSF system can simultaneously enhance exciton utilization, accelerate exciton dynamics, and reduce the concentration of triplet excitons. The smooth management of excitons makes the overall performance of the THSF device superior to the control TTA fluorescence and HSF devices. Furthermore, a high&#8208;performance narrowband blue (CIEx,y = 0.13, 0.12) OLED is achieved using a two&#8208;unit tandem device design, providing an excellent maximum external quantum efficiency of 18.3%, a record&#8208;high L90% (the luminance where the &#414;ext drops to 90% of its peak value) of &#8776;20&#160;000&#160;cd m&#8722;2, and a long half&#8208;lifetime at 100&#160;cd m&#8722;2 initial luminance of &#8776;13&#160;256&#160;h. These results showcase the great potential of the THSF strategy in realizing efficient and stable blue OLEDs with narrow emission and high luminance.

         <dc:description>
This study presents an anisotropic inductive liquid metal sensor (AI&#8208;LMS) inspired by the biomechanical properties of human fingertips. The AI&#8208;LMS demonstrates superior performance in multidimensional pressure sensing, characterized by high linearity and stability.

Abstract
The advancement of robotic behavior and intelligence has led to an urgent demand for improving their sensitivity and interactive capabilities, which presents challenges in achieving multidimensional, wide&#8208;ranging, and reliable tactile sensing. Here an anisotropic inductive liquid metal sensor (AI&#8208;LMS) is introduced inspired by the human fingertip, which inherently possesses the capability to detect spatially multi&#8208;axis pressure with a wide sensing range, exceptional linearity, and signal stability. Additionally, it can detect very small pressures and responds swiftly to prescribed forces. Compared to resistive signals, inductive signals offer significant advantages. Further, integrated with a deep neural network model, the AI&#8208;LMS can decouple multi&#8208;axis pressures acting simultaneously upon it. Notably, the sensing range of Ecoflex and PDMS&#8208;based AI&#8208;LMS can be expanded by a factor of 4 and 9.5, respectively. For practical illustrations, a high&#8208;precision surface scanning reconstruction system is developed capable of capturing intricate details of 3D surface profiles. The utilization of biomimetic AI&#8208;LMS as robotic fingertips enables real&#8208;time discrimination of diverse delicate grasping behaviors across different fingers. The innovations and unique features in sensing mechanisms and structural design are expected to bring transformative changes and find extensive applications in the field of soft robotics.

         <title>Durable Proton Exchange Membrane Based on Polymers of Intrinsic Microporosity for Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel composite proton exchange membrane (PEM) design that leverages carboxylic acid&#8208;functionalized polymers of intrinsic microporosity (cPIM&#8208;1) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). Harnessing Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions enables the development of a synergistic microporous structure that confines phosphoric acid clusters, enhancing proton conductivity and durability. This work addresses critical challenges in PEM development, while proposing a solutionfor&#160;the design of next&#8208;generation membranes.









Abstract
High&#8208;temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cells (HT&#8208;PEMFCs) is regarded as a promising energy conversion system owing to simplified water management and enhanced tolerance to fuel impurities. However, phosphoric acid (PA) leaching remains a critical issue, diminishing energy density and durability, posing significant obstacle to the commercial development of HT&#8208;PEMFCs. To address this, composite membranes incorporating the carboxylic acid&#8208;modified polymer of intrinsic microporosity (cPIM&#8208;1) are designed as framework polymer, blended with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) for HT&#8208;PEMFCs. The Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions between cPIM&#8208;1 and PVP created an extensive hydrogen&#8208;bonding network, improving membrane compatibility. The optimized microporous structure and multiple anchoring sites gave rise to &#8220;domain&#8208;limited&#8221; PA clusters, enhancing the capillary effect. Simultaneously, improved hydrophobicity synergistically optimizes catalytic interface, promoting continuous and stable proton transfer. The HT&#8208;PEMFCs based on PVP/cPIM&#8208;1 composite membrane achieved a peak power density of 1090.0&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 160&#160;&#176;C, representing a 152% improvement compared to PVP/PES membrane. Additionally, it demonstrated excellent durability, with a voltage decay of 0.058&#160;mV&#160;h&#8722;1 over 210&#160;h of accelerated stress test corresponds to more than 5000&#160;h of constant current density durability test. This study presents a promising strategy for the development of high&#8208;performance and durable novel membranes in various energy conversion systems.

         <title>Critical Roles of Ultrafast Energy Funnelling and Ultrafast Singlet&#8208;Triplet Annihilation in Quasi&#8208;2D Perovskite Optical Gain Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrafast broadband photoluminescence spectroscopy provides insights into the lasing dynamics, energy transfer, and singlet&#8208;triplet annihilation in mixed&#8208;layer quasi&#8208;2D perovskites. Rapid energy funnelling to the sites of amplified spontaneous emission occurs within sub&#8208;picosecond timescales. However, the accumulation of triplet excitons effectively quenches incoming singlet excitons, creating a bottleneck in the energy cascade and hindering the development of population inversion.









Abstract
Quasi&#8208;2D (Q2D) perovskite possess considerable potential for light emission and amplification technologies. Recently, mixed films containing Q2D perovskite grains with varying layer thicknesses have shown great promise as carrier concentrators, effectively mitigating trap&#8208;mediated recombination. In this strategy, photo&#8208;excitations are rapidly funnelled down an energy gradient to the thickest grains, leading to amplified spontaneous emission (ASE). However, the quantum&#8208;confined Q2D slabs also stabilize the formation of unwanted triplet excitons, resulting in parasitic quenching of emissive singlet states. Here, a novel ultrafast photoluminescence spectroscopy is used to study photoexcitation dynamics in mixed&#8208;layer Q2D perovskites. By analysing spectra with high temporal and energy resolution, this is found that sub&#8208;picosecond energy transfer to ASE sites is accompanied by excitation losses due to triplet formation on grains with small and intermediate thicknesses. Further accumulation of triplets creates a bottleneck in the energy cascade, effectively quenching incoming singlet excitons. This ultrafast annihilation within 200 femtosecond outpaces energy transfer to ASE sites, preventing the build&#8208;up of population inversion. This study highlights the significance of investigating photoexcitation dynamics on ultrafast timescales, encompassing lasing dynamics, energy transfer, and singlet&#8208;triplet annihilation, to gain crucial insights into the photophysics of the optical gain process in Q2D perovskites.

Recently, mixed films containing Q2D perovskite grains with varying layer thicknesses have shown great promise as carrier concentrators, effectively mitigating trap-mediated recombination. In this strategy, photo-excitations are rapidly funnelled down an energy gradient to the thickest grains, leading to amplified spontaneous emission (ASE). However, the quantum-confined Q2D slabs also stabilize the formation of unwanted triplet excitons, resulting in parasitic quenching of emissive singlet states. Here, a novel ultrafast photoluminescence spectroscopy is used to study photoexcitation dynamics in mixed-layer Q2D perovskites. By analysing spectra with high temporal and energy resolution, this is found that sub-picosecond energy transfer to ASE sites is accompanied by excitation losses due to triplet formation on grains with small and intermediate thicknesses. Further accumulation of triplets creates a bottleneck in the energy cascade, effectively quenching incoming singlet excitons. This ultrafast annihilation within 200 femtosecond outpaces energy transfer to ASE sites, preventing the build-up of population inversion. This study highlights the significance of investigating photoexcitation dynamics on ultrafast timescales, encompassing lasing dynamics, energy transfer, and singlet-triplet annihilation, to gain crucial insights into the photophysics of the optical gain process in Q2D perovskites.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lignin&#8208;Based Separators for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries via a Dry Fibrillation Method</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Can lignin revolutionize lithium&#8208;ion battery separators? A single&#8208;layer lignin&#8208;based ultrathin separator (as thin as 15&#160;&#181;m) is fabricated using a dry fibrillation method, enabling exceptional thermal stability, low energy consumption, and full material utilization. Sulfonate functional groups enhance interfacial stability, significantly improving cycling in graphite||NMC811 and Si&#8208;Gr||NMC811 cells. This scalable, sustainable approach paves the way for next&#8208;generation functional separators.








Abstract
Separators are critical components in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), preventing internal short circuits, mitigating thermal runaway, and influencing rate capability and cycling performance. However, current polyolefin separators suffer from limitations, such as high thermal shrinkage, relatively poor wettability, and inadequate long&#8208;term stability, impacting safety and cycle life in critical applications like electric vehicles. Here, a single&#8208;layer lignin&#8208;based ultrathin separator (as thin as 15&#160;&#181;m) with exceptional intrinsic thermal stability and cycling performance is demonstrated. The separator is fabricated using lignosulfonate, a natural polymer derived as a byproduct of chemical pulping and biorefinery processes. By employing a dry fibrillation method, the process achieves low energy consumption and a 100% raw material conversion rate, highlighting its scalability and sustainability. Interfacial studies reveal the improved cycling performance in both graphite||NMC811 and Si&#8208;Gr||NMC811 cells is attributed to the abundant sulfonate functional groups in lignosulfonates, which promote the formation of a sulfur&#8208;rich cathode/solid electrolyte interphases (CEI/SEI) with low resistance in both the cathode and anode. The high thermal stability, manufacturing feasibility, battery performance, and low cost of such lignin&#8208;based separators offer new inspiration for developing next&#8208;generation, single&#8208;layer functional separators tailored for high&#8208;performance LIBs.

         <title>Universally Applicable and Ultra&#8208;Long Life Cyclic Power Generation Induced by Interfacial Ion&#8208;Oscillation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electric power generating cell is developed based on potential difference driven reversible ion migration, which generates ultra&#8208;long life electric output over 8&#8208;month with a high short&#8208;circuit of over 40&#160;mA and output power density of up to 6&#160;W m&#8722;2, surpassing the values reported for many other sorts of typical electricity generators.









Abstract
Sustainable energy supply without relying on external power sources is one of the bottlenecks in achieving self&#8208;supportive wearable electronics and Internet&#8208;of&#8208;things (IoT) systems. Here a new type of universally applicable and ultra&#8208;long life cyclic power generation is developed induced by interfacial redox reaction&#8208;mediated ion&#8208;oscillation, which can provide cycling electric energy in a self&#8208;charging manner without extra pre&#8208;charge. Based on asymmetric manganese dioxide and molybdenum disulfide electrode pairs, the proof&#8208;concept electric potential difference power generating cell (EPDC) offers ultra&#8208;long life electric output over 8&#8208;month testing period for tens of thousands of cycles. A layer&#8208;stacking EPDC unit supplies a high direct current of more than 40&#160;mA and a power density of &#8776;6&#160;W m&#8722;2. Such recyclable power&#8208;generating process mainly relies on reversible ion migration at an asymmetric interface in response to relative variation of electric potentials. The universal applicability of EPDC is validated by a combination of diverse electrode pairs. Large&#8208;scale manufacture of EPDCs is achievable by industry&#8208;compatible auto&#8208;blade coating technology with on&#8208;demand power output, providing a long&#8208;acting power supply platform for self&#8208;charging electronic systems.

         <title>Interfacial Adsorption Layers Based on Amino Acid Analogues to Enable Dual Stabilization toward Long&#8208;Life Aqueous Zinc Iodine Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interfacial adsorption layers based on N,N&#8208;bis(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl)glycine (BHEG) are constructed to inhibit Zn corrosion and polyiodide shuttle by employing an electrolyte additive strategy. These layers stabilize Zn anode via creating a &#8220;H2O&#8208;deficient&#8221; inner Helmholtz plane (IHP) and buffering the interfacial pH, while hindering polyiodide migration at the I2 cathode through ion&#8211;dipole interactions. Attributing to these benefits, a long&#8208;lasting aqueous Zn&#8211;I2 battery is realized.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8211;iodine (Zn&#8211;I2) batteries are promising candidates for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to the merits of low cost and high safety. However, their commercial application is hindered by Zn corrosion and polyiodide shuttle at I2 cathode. Herein, N,N&#8208;bis(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl)glycine (BHEG) based interfacial adsorption layers are constructed to stabilize Zn anodes and mitigate polyiodide shuttle according to ion&#8211;dipole interactions, by using a strategy of electrolyte additive. The tertiary amine (N(CH2)3) and carboxyl (&#9472;COO&#8722;) groups in the deprotonated BHEG can reversibly capture H+ and dynamically neutralize OH&#8722; ions, efficiently buffering the interfacial pH of Zn metal anodes and suppressing hydrogen evolution reactions. Additionally, the BHEG adsorption layers can repel 39.3% of H2O molecules at the Zn interface, creating a &#8220;water&#8208;deficient&#8221; inner Helmholtz plane and preventing Zn corrosion. Significantly, the N(CH2)3 groups in BHEG also inhibit polyiodide shuttle at the I2 cathode, which exhibits high adsorption energies of &#8722;0.88, &#8722;0.41, and &#8722;0.39&#160;eV for I&#8722;, I2, and I3&#8722;, respectively. Attributing to these benefits, the Zn&#8211;I2 battery can achieve a high areal capacity of 2.99 mAh cm&#8722;2 and an extended cycling life of 2,000 cycles, even at a high mass loading of I2 cathode (&#8776;21.5&#160;mg cm&#8722;2).

Abstract
Organohydrogels have significant applications in numerous fields. The current synthetic strategies generally rely on the intricate and complex design of lipophilic or hydrophilic polymers to achieve the goal of oil&#8208;water interpenetration. Herein, sub&#8208;nanowires organohydrogels with a dual&#8208;phase structure are fabricated by simply mixing hydroxyapatite sub&#8208;nanowires with organic solvent and aqueous phase. The sub&#8208;nanowires in the oil phase provide structural support, while surfactants in the sub&#8208;nanowires exist at the interface between oil and water, thus forming the water&#8208;in&#8208;oil structure. The organohydrogels possess commendable mechanical properties, an inherent self&#8208;healing ability, and a specific temperature&#8208;responsive behavior. Moreover, the organohydrogels are compatible with a variety of organic solvents and polymers, reserving the promise for wide&#8208;range applications in the future.

The current synthetic strategies generally rely on the intricate and complex design of lipophilic or hydrophilic polymers to achieve the goal of oil-water interpenetration. Herein, sub-nanowires organohydrogels with a dual-phase structure are fabricated by simply mixing hydroxyapatite sub-nanowires with organic solvent and aqueous phase. The sub-nanowires in the oil phase provide structural support, while surfactants in the sub-nanowires exist at the interface between oil and water, thus forming the water-in-oil structure. The organohydrogels possess commendable mechanical properties, an inherent self-healing ability, and a specific temperature-responsive behavior. Moreover, the organohydrogels are compatible with a variety of organic solvents and polymers, reserving the promise for wide-range applications in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nose&#8208;to&#8208;Brain Delivery of Circular RNA SCMH1&#8208;Loaded Lipid Nanoparticles for Ischemic Stroke Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and safe circular&#8208;RNA delivery system circSCMH1@LNP1 is developed for direct nose&#8208;to&#8208;brain delivery of circRNA SCMH1 to ischemic lesions. Experiments demonstrate that intranasally administrated circSCMH1@LNP1 significantly accumulates in the peri&#8208;infarct region of PT stroke mice, thereby improving functional recovery by enhancing synaptic plasticity, vascular repair, neuroinflammation relief, and myelin sheath formation.








Abstract
Ischemic stroke represents one of the leading cerebrovascular diseases with a high rate of mortality and disability globally. To date, there are no effective clinical drugs available to improve long&#8208;term outcomes for post&#8208;stroke patients. A novel nucleic acid agent circSCMH1 which can promote sensorimotor function recovery in rodent and nonhuman primate animal stroke models has been found. However, there are still delivery challenges to overcome for its clinical implementation. Besides, its effects on post&#8208;stroke cognitive functions remain unexplored. Herein, lipid nanoparticle circSCMH1@LNP1 is established to deliver circSCMH1 and explore its therapeutic efficacy comprehensively. Distribution experiments demonstrate that intranasal administration of circSCMH1@LNP1 significantly increases circSCMH1 distribution in the peri&#8208;infarct region and reduces its non&#8208;specific accumulation in other organs compared to intravenous injection. Therapeutic results indicate that circSCMH1@LNP1 promotes synaptic plasticity, vascular repair, neuroinflammation relief, and myelin sheath formation, thereby achieving enhanced sensorimotor and cognitive function recovery in post&#8208;stroke mice. In conclusion, this research presents a simple and effective LNP system for efficient delivery of circSCMH1 via intranasal administration to repair post&#8208;stroke brain injury. It is envisioned that this study may bridge a crucial gap between basic research and translational application, paving the way for clinical implementation of novel circSCMH1 in post&#8208;stroke patient management.

         <title>Self&#8208;Regulating the Local Conjugation of Tertiary Aniline toward Highly Stable Polymer Li Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermo&#8208;electrochemically compatible polymer electrolyte is proposed with a locally conjugated structure through self&#8208;regulation of paired tertiary anilines coupled with in situ polymerization, which significantly reconstructs an improved Li+ solvation and enhances electrode/electrolyte interfacial stability of LMBs. This concept provides an important theoretical basis and technical means for achieving practical high energy/power density LMBs.








Abstract
Pursuing high energy/power density lithium metal batteries (LMBs) with good safety and lifespan is essential for developing next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;storage devices. Nevertheless, the uncontrollable degradation of the electrolyte and the subsequent formation of inferior electrolyte/electrode interfaces present formidable challenges to this endeavor, especially when paring with transition metal oxide cathode. Herein, a fireproof polymeric matrix with a local conjugated structure is constructed by 4,4&#8242;&#8208;methylenebis (N, N&#8208;diglycidylaniline) (NDA) monomer via in situ polymerization, which promotes the use of ester&#8208;based liquid electrolyte for highly stable LMBs. The conjugated tertiary anilines in this PNDA electrolyte effectively tune the Li+ solvation sheath and generate conformal protective layers on the electrode surfaces, resulting in excellent compatibility with both high&#8208;voltage cathodes and Li&#8208;metal anodes. Moreover, the accumulated electron density endows PNDA with a powerful capability to seize and eliminate the corrosive hydrofluoric acid, which strikingly mitigates the irreversible structure transformation of LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC) particles. As a result, the PNDA&#8208;based Li||LiFePO4 and Li||NMC cells reach excellent electrochemical and safety performance. This study provides a promising strategy for the macromolecular design of electrolytes and emphasizes the importance of &#8220;local conjugation&#8221; within the polymers for LMBs.

         <title>A Strain Relaxation Modulation for Printing High&#8208;performance Flexible Pseudo&#8208;Planar Heterojunction Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rational toughening of photosensitive films is crucial for the development of flexible organic solar cells. Herein, a fine&#8208;grain strengthening strategy is demonstrated for mitigating the excessive aggregation or crystallization in small&#8208;molecule acceptor films, thereby suppressing the non&#8208;ideal thermodynamic behavior and residual&#8208;enriched state. Thus, these provide the potential for the synergistic enhancement of efficiency, mechanical and environmental stability in organic photovoltaics.








Abstract
The rational toughening of photosensitive films is crucial for the development of robust and flexible organic solar cells (F&#8208;OSCs), which are always influenced by mechanical strain and thermodynamic relaxation within the films. Nevertheless, the potential determinants of these properties and quantitative metrics modulating the overall performance of flexible devices have not been thoroughly defined. Herein, a fine&#8208;grain strengthening strategy is demonstrated for mitigating the excessive aggregation or crystallization in small&#8208;molecule acceptor films, the secondary thermal relaxation of side chains in polyethylene oxide (PEO) local motion restricts the free fluctuation volume through hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions, thereby suppressing the non&#8208;ideal thermodynamic behavior and residual&#8208;enriched state. These contribute to an increase in yield strength and a reduction in microcracks while enhancing the fracture energy at the donor/acceptor interface. Finally, the optimal F&#8208;OSCs demonstrate champion PCEs of 19.12% (0.04 cm2) and 16.92% (1.00 cm2), and maintain 80% of their initial efficiency after heating at 85 &#176;C for 2600&#160;h. Besides, the flexibility and mechanical robustness of devices are also optimized, the elastic modulus and stiffness are decreased by 50.68% and 5.71%. This work provides interesting references for the synergistic enhancement of efficiency, mechanical and environmental stability in flexible organic photovoltaics.

         <title>Solid Polymer Electrolyte with Compatible Cathode&#8208;Electrolyte Interfacial Design Enabling Lithium Metal Batteries Operation at 4.8&#160;V with Long Cycle Life</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduce a novel approach to enhancing cathode&#8208;SPE compatibility by utilizing the same poly(ionic liquid) (PolyIL)&#8208;based material in both the SPE and the cathode binder. A modified biomass&#8208;based PolyIL substrate, enriched with highly negatively charged C&#9552;O and &#9472;OH groups, is incorporated into the SPE to improve Li+ migration and strengthen its mechanical properties. The Li||LiFePO&#8324; cell, assembled via in situ photopolymerization, demonstrate stable cycling for over 1100 cycles, while the Li||NCM811 cell operated reliably at a high cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.8 V for 100 cycles.








Abstract
Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) with solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) offer higher energy density and enhance safety compared to the Li&#8208;ion batteries that use a graphite anode and organic electrolytes. However, achieving long cycle life for LMBs while enabling the use of high&#8208;voltage cathodes required the compatibility between cathode&#8208;SPE, rather than focusing solely on the individual components. This study presente a dual&#8208;functional poly(ionic liquid) (PolyIL)&#8208;based material that simultaneously serves as an SPE matrix and a cathode binder, constructing a cathode&#8208;SPE interface with exceptional (electro)chemical compatibility owing to the high ionic conductivity and wide electrochemical stability window. Additionally, a modified cellulose acetate (CA)&#8208;based PolyIL substrate, enriched with C&#9552;O and &#9472;OH groups, is designed rationally and incorporated to assist the Li+ migration, leveraging their highly negative charge, and enhancing the mechanical strength of the SPE. Furthermore, an in situ polymerization approach is employed to assemble the cells, improving the physical compatibility at the cathode&#8208;SPE interface. As a result, the Li||LFP cell demonstrate stable cycling beyond 1100 cycles, and the Li||NCM811 cell reliably operates at a high cut&#8208;off voltage of up to 4.8&#160;V.

         <title>2D Rhodium&#8208;Isocyanide Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rhodium&#8208;carbon coordination&#8208;based 2D metal&#8208;organic frameworks are rationally synthesized and exhibit ultra&#8208;narrow bandgaps (0.10&#8211;0.28&#160;eV) and intrinsic charge mobilities up to 560 &#177;&#160;46 cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 via time&#8208;resolved terahertz spectroscopy.








Abstract
2D metal&#8208;organic frameworks (2D MOFs) are emerging organic van der Waals materials with great potential in various applications owing to their structural diversity, and tunable optoelectronic properties. So far, most reported 2D MOFs rely on metal&#8208;heteroatom coordination (e.g., metal&#8211;nitrogen, metal&#8211;oxygen, and metal&#8211;sulfur); synthesis of metal&#8208;carbon coordination based 2D MOFs remains a formidable challenge. This study reports the rhodium&#8211;carbon (Rh&#8211;C) coordination&#8208;based 2D MOFs, using isocyanide as the ligand and Rh(I) as metal node. The synthesized MOFs show excellent crystallinity with quasi&#8208;square lattice networks. These MOFs show ultra&#8208;narrow bandgaps (0.1&#8211;0.28&#160;eV) resulting from the interaction between Rh(I) and isocyano groups. Terahertz spectroscopy demonstrates exceptional short&#8208;range charge mobilities up to 560 &#177;&#160;46 cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 in the as&#8208;synthesized MOFs. Moreover, these MOFs are used as electrocatalysts for nitrogen reduction reaction and show an excellent NH3 yield rate of 56.0 &#177;&#160;1.5&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1 and a record Faradaic efficiency of 87.1 &#177;&#160;1.8%. In situ experiments reveal dual pathways involving Rh(I) during the catalytic process. This work represents a pioneering step toward 2D MOFs based on metal&#8211;carbon coordination and paves the way for novel reticular materials with ultra&#8208;high carrier mobility and for versatile optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Revealing the Coordination and Mediation Mechanism of Arylboronic Acids Toward Energy&#8208;Dense Li&#8208;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Arylboronic acids are explored for use in the electrolyte engineering of Li&#9472;S batteries. The theoretically and experimentally verified coordination and mediation chemistry of arylboronic acids can not only stabilize the anode interface but also accelerate the sluggish sulfur conversion. 3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenylboronic acid (BPBA) is chosen as a suitable electrolyte modifier, significantly improving the electrochemical performance of Li&#9472;S batteries.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#9472;S) batteries offer a promising avenue for the next generation of energy&#8208;dense batteries. However, it is quite challenging to realize practical Li&#9472;S batteries under limited electrolytes and high sulfur loading, which may exacerbate problems of interface deterioration and low sulfur utilization. Herein, the coordination and mediation chemistry of arylboronic acids that enable energy&#8208;dense and long&#8208;term&#8208;cycling Li&#9472;S batteries is proposed. The coordination chemistry between NO3&#8722; and arylboronic acids breaks the resonance configuration of NO3&#8722; and thermodynamically promotes its reduction on the anode, contributing to a mechanically robust interface. The mediation chemistry between lithium arylborate and polysulfides distorts S&#9472;S/Li&#9472;S bonds, alters the rate&#8208;determining step from Li2S4&#8594;Li2S2 to Li2S6&#8594;Li2S4, and homogeneously accelerates the sulfur redox kinetics. Li&#9472;S batteries using 3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenylboronic acid (BPBA) show excellent cycling stability (1000 cycles with a low capacity decay rate of 0.033% per cycle) and a high energy density of 422&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 under aggressive chemical environments (high sulfur loading of 17.4&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 and lean electrolyte operation of 3.6&#160;mL gS&#8722;1). The basic mechanism of coordination and mediation chemistry can be extended to other arylboronic acids with different configurations and compositions, thus broadening the application prospect of arylboronic acids in the electrolyte engineering of Li&#9472;S batteries.

         <title>Unlocking Multimodal Nonlinear Microscopy for Deep&#8208;Tissue Imaging under Continuous&#8208;Wave Excitation with Tunable Upconverting Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a multimodal nonlinear microscopy approach using upconverting nanoparticles (UCNPs) under continuous&#8208;wave excitation. The UCNPs exhibit high&#8208;order nonlinear optical responses, enabling deep&#8208;tissue 3D imaging, video&#8208;rate wide&#8208;field imaging, and depth&#8208;selective photomodulation. High&#8208;resolution in vivo imaging of mouse cerebrovascular networks is demonstrated, highlighting the potential for cost&#8208;effective bioimaging and targeted phototherapy applications.








Abstract
Nonlinear microscopy provides excellent depth penetration and axial sectioning for 3D imaging, yet widespread adoption is limited by reliance on expensive ultrafast pulsed lasers. This work circumvents such limitations by employing rare&#8208;earth doped upconverting nanoparticles (UCNPs), specifically Yb3+/Tm3+ co&#8208;doped NaYF4 nanocrystals, which exhibit strong multimodal nonlinear optical responses under continuous&#8208;wave (CW) excitation. These UCNPs emit multiple wavelengths at UV (&#955; &#8776; 450 nm), blue (&#955; &#8776; 450 nm), and NIR (&#955; &#8776; 800 nm), whose intensities are nonlinearly governed by excitation power. Exploiting these properties, multi&#8208;colored nonlinear emissions enable functional imaging of cerebral blood vessels in deep brain. Using a simple optical setup, high resolution in vivo 3D imaging of mouse cerebrovascular networks at depths up to 800 &#181;mm is achieved, surpassing performance of conventional imaging methods using CW lasers. In vivo cerebrovascular flow dynamics is also visualized with wide&#8208;field video&#8208;rate imaging under low&#8208;powered CW excitation. Furthermore, UCNPs enable depth&#8208;selective, 3D&#8208;localized photo&#8208;modulation through turbid media, presenting spatiotemporally targeted light beacons. This innovative approach, leveraging UCNPs' intrinsic nonlinear optical characteristics, significantly advances multimodal nonlinear microscopy with CW lasers, opening new opportunities in bio&#8208;imaging, remote optogenetics, and photodynamic therapy.

         <title>Establishing Nanoscale Circuitry by Designing a Structure with Atomic Short&#8208;range Order for High&#8208;Rate Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microsized perovskite oxide Ce0.266W0.1Nb0.9O3 is engineered as an anode material for high&#8208;rate, long&#8208;life Li+ storage, demonstrating impressive performance by maintaining both high areal capacity and high rate capability, even at high mass loadings. This outstanding electrochemical behavior is primarily attributed to the nanoscale circuitry formed by an atomic&#8208;scale short&#8208;range order structure.








Abstract
High&#8208;rate materials necessitate the rapid transportation of both electrons and ions, a requirement that becomes especially challenging at practical mass loadings (&gt;10 mg cm2). To address this challenge, a material is designed with an architecture having atomic&#8208;scale short&#8208;range order. This design establishes internal nanoscale circuitry at the particle level, which facilitates rapid electronic and ionic transport within micrometer&#8208;sized niobium tungsten oxides. The architecture features alternating cerium&#8208;depleted and cerium&#8208;enriched regions. The continuous cerium&#8208;enriched regions with enhanced conductivity provide multilane highways for electron mobility by functioning as electron&#8208;conducting wires that significantly boost the overall conductivity. The cerium&#8208;depleted regions effectively mitigate electrostatic repulsion and promote rapid ion transport through ion&#8208;conducting channels. These structural characteristics provide a continuous network that supports both electrical migration and chemical diffusion to amplify the areal capacity and rate capability even at high mass loadings. These findings not only expand the fundamental understanding of the design of optimal host lattices for advanced energy storage systems but also of the practical application of microsized high&#8208;rate electrode materials.

&lt;p&gt;A microsized perovskite oxide Ce&lt;sub&gt;0.266&lt;/sub&gt;W&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Nb&lt;sub&gt;0.9&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is engineered as an anode material for high-rate, long-life Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; storage, demonstrating impressive performance by maintaining both high areal capacity and high rate capability, even at high mass loadings. This outstanding electrochemical behavior is primarily attributed to the nanoscale circuitry formed by an atomic-scale short-range order structure.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-rate materials necessitate the rapid transportation of both electrons and ions, a requirement that becomes especially challenging at practical mass loadings (&amp;gt;10 mg cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). To address this challenge, a material is designed with an architecture having atomic-scale short-range order. This design establishes internal nanoscale circuitry at the particle level, which facilitates rapid electronic and ionic transport within micrometer-sized niobium tungsten oxides. The architecture features alternating cerium-depleted and cerium-enriched regions. The continuous cerium-enriched regions with enhanced conductivity provide multilane highways for electron mobility by functioning as electron-conducting wires that significantly boost the overall conductivity. The cerium-depleted regions effectively mitigate electrostatic repulsion and promote rapid ion transport through ion-conducting channels. These structural characteristics provide a continuous network that supports both electrical migration and chemical diffusion to amplify the areal capacity and rate capability even at high mass loadings. These findings not only expand the fundamental understanding of the design of optimal host lattices for advanced energy storage systems but also of the practical application of microsized high-rate electrode materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regulating Interfacial H2O Activity and H2 Bubbles by Core/Shell Nanoarrays for 800 h Stable Alkaline Seawater Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To concurrently improve activity and stability for seawater electrolysis under high current densities, the problems of firm adherence and coverage of H2 bubbles with core/shell nanoarrays, addressed which further regulates the interfacial H2O activity to reduce overpotentials, hence highlighting its potential as a sustainable and economically feasible application for large&#8208;scale hydrogen production.








Abstract
The catalytic activity and stability under high current densities for hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) are impeded by firm adherence and coverage of H2 bubbles to the catalytic sites. Herein, we systematically synthesize core/shell nanoarrays to engineer bubble transport channels, which further remarkably regulate interfacial H2O activity, and swift H2 bubble generation and release. The self&#8208;supported catalyst holds uniform ultra&#8208;low Ru active sites of 0.38&#160;wt% and promotes the rapid formation of plentiful small H2 bubbles, which are rapidly released by the upright channels, mitigating the blockage of active sites and avoiding surface damage from bubble movements. As a result, these core/shell nanoarrays achieve ultralow overpotentials of 18 and 24 mV to reach 10 mA cm&#8722;2 for HER in 1 M KOH freshwater and seawater, respectively. Additionally, the assembled electrolyzer demonstrates stable durability over 800 hours with a high current density of 2 A cm&#8722;2 in 1 M KOH seawater. The techno&#8208;economic analysis (TEA) indicates that the unit cost of the hydrogen production system is nearly half of the DOE's (Department of Energy) 2026 target. Our work addresses the stability challenges of HER and highlights its potential as a sustainable and economically feasible solution for large&#8208;scale hydrogen production of seawater.

         <title>Linear Dielectric Polymers with Ferroelectric&#8208;Like Crystals for High&#8208;Temperature Capacitive Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reveals the pivotal role of ferroelectric&#8208;like crystals in boosting the high&#8208;temperature capacitive energy storage of polynorbornene dielectrics. This distinctive characteristic enables the polymers to exhibit an impressive high&#8208;temperature discharge energy density of 6.76 J cm&#8722;3, even under electric fields that are far below their Weibull breakdown strength.








Abstract
Achieving optimal capacitive energy storage performance necessitates the integration of high energy storage density, typical of ferroelectric dielectrics, with the low polarization loss associated with linear dielectrics. However, combining these characteristics in a single dielectric material is challenging due to the inherent contradictions between the spontaneous polarization of ferroelectric dielectrics and the adaptability of linear dielectrics to changes in the electric field. To address this issue, a linear isotactic sulfonylated polynorbornene dielectric characterized by ferroelectric&#8208;like crystals has been developed. The sulfonyl dipoles in the ferroelectric&#8208;like crystals are oriented in the same direction, thereby enabling this polymer to exhibit a considerable dielectric constant (7.5) at room temperature. Notably, when the operating temperature surpasses the polymer's glass transition temperature (Tg &#8776; 140 &#176;C), its dielectric constant rises to 12 with just minor changes in the dissipation factor. At 150 &#176;C, 90% efficiency of the discharge energy density reaches as high as 6.76 J&#160;cm&#8722;1 under a low electric field of 320 MV m&#8722;1, which is ten times that of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art, high&#8208;temperature, capacitor&#8208;grade polyetherimide. The enhancement of high&#8208;temperature capacitive performance, achieved by utilizing the crystallinity of isotactic polymers to form a polar structure, presents a new perspective for the design of high&#8208;temperature dielectric polymers.

         <title>TREM2 scFv&#8208;Engineering Escherichia coli Displaying Modulation of Macrophages to Boost Cancer Radio&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>

A novel ionizing radiation&#8208;responsive delivery system is designed for the precise expression of anti&#8208;TREM2 single&#8208;chain antibody fragments (scFv) using an engineered probiotic, Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN), to modulate immunotherapy.








Abstract
Preoperative neoadjuvant radio&#8208;chemotherapy is a cornerstone in the treatment of low rectal cancer, yet its effectiveness can be limited by the insensitivity of some patients, profoundly impacting their quality of life. Through preliminary research, it is found that TREM2+ macrophages play a pivotal role in the non&#8208;responsiveness to immunotherapy. To address this challenge, a novel ionizing radiation&#8208;responsive delivery system is developed for the precise expression of anti&#8208;TREM2 single&#8208;chain antibody fragments (scFv) using an engineered probiotic, Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN), to modulate immunotherapy. The released anti&#8208;TREM2 scFv can be precisely targeted and delivered to the tumor site via the engineered EcN outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), thereby reversing the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and enhancing tumor therapeutic efficiency when used in combination with the &#945;PD&#8208;L1 immune checkpoint inhibitor. Additionally, these engineered bacteria can be further modified to enhance the intestinal colonization capabilities through oral administration, thereby regulating the gut microbiota and its metabolic byproducts. Consequently, the ionizing radiation&#8208;responsive drug delivery system based on the engineered bacteria not only introduces a promising new therapeutic option for low rectal cancer but also showcases the potential to finely tune immune responses within the intricate tumor microenvironment, paving the way for innovative strategies in tumor radio&#8208;immunotherapy.

Implantable devices rely on batteries that demand surgical replacement, posing risks, and financial burdens. Ultrasound energy transfer (US&#8208;ET) offers a revolutionary wireless alternative but struggles with efficiency. The presented dielectric&#8208;ferroelectric&#8208;boosted US&#8208;TENG (US&#8208;TENGDF&#8208;B) is thin, flexible, and biocompatible that provides high&#8208;efficiency and stable power delivery in curved positions, fostering a future of noninvasive and sustainable wireless energy transfer solutions for biomedical applications.








Abstract
Wireless powering of rechargeable&#8208;implantable medical devices presents a challenge in developing reliable wireless energy transfer systems that meet medical safety and standards. Ultrasound&#8208;driven triboelectric nanogenerators (US&#8208;TENG) are investigated for various medical applications, including noninvasive percutaneous wireless battery powering to reduce the need for multiple surgeries for battery replacement. However, these devices often suffer from inefficiency due to limited output performance and rigidity. To address this issue, a dielectric&#8208;ferroelectric boosted US&#8208;TENG (US&#8208;TENGDF&#8208;B) capable of producing a high output charge with low&#8208;intensity ultrasound and a long probe distance is developed, comparatively. The feasibility and output stability of this deformable and augmented device is confirmed under various bending conditions, making it suitable for use in the body's curved positions or with electronic implants. The device achieved an output of &#8776;26&#160;V and &#8776;6.7&#160;mW output for remote charging of a rechargeable battery at a 35&#160;mm distance. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the output&#8208;augmented US&#8208;TENG for deep short&#8208;term wireless charging of implantable electronics with flexing conditions in curved devices such as future total artificial hearts.

         <title>Ultraviolet Optoelectronic Synapse Based on AlScN/p&#8208;i&#8208;n GaN Heterojunction for Advanced Artificial Vision Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Researchers have developed a two&#8208;terminal AlScN/p&#8208;i&#8208;n GaN heterojunction ferroelectric memristor with ultraviolet photoelectric synapse function, enabling nonvolatile memory and optoelectronic synaptic characteristics. This innovation achieves a high memory on/off ratio and a relatively low synaptic energy consumption, advancing optoelectronics and artificial vision systems with potential applications in on&#8208;chip sensing and computing.








Abstract
Ferroelectric materials represent a frontier in semiconductor research, offering the potential for novel optoelectronics. AlScN material is a kind of outstanding ferroelectric semiconductor with strong residual polarization, high Curie temperature, and mainstream semiconductor fabrication compatibility. However, it is challenging to realize multi&#8208;state optical responders due to their limited light sensitivity. Here, a two&#8208;terminal AlScN/p&#8208;i&#8208;n GaN heterojunction ultraviolet optoelectronic synapse is fabricated, overcoming this limitation by leveraging hole capture at the AlScN/p&#8208;GaN hetero&#8208;interface for multi&#8208;state modulation. The novel structure maintains excellent memristor characteristics based on the ferroelectric of AlScN, realizing an on/off ratio of 9.36&#160;&#215;&#160;105. More importantly, the device can mimic synaptic characteristics essential for artificial vision systems, achieving an image recognition accuracy of 93.7% with a weight evolution nonlinearity of 0.26. This approach not only extends the applications of AlScN in optoelectronics but also paves the way for advanced artificial vision systems with image preprocessing and recognition capabilities. The findings provide a step forward in the development of non&#8208;volatile memories with potential for on&#8208;chip sensing and computing.

         <title>Efficient Photoelectrocatalytic Synthesis of Ammonia by Superionic Conductor with Mixed Ion/Electron Conduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A van der Waals FePS2.66Li0.87 superionic conductor (SIC) with enhanced mixed electronic/ionic conductivity is applied for solar&#8208;driven nitrate conversion to ammonia. The migration of mobile lithium ions between layers significantly promotes the electronic conductivity of FePS2.66Li0.87 SIC, which achieves a remarkable ammonia synthesis yield (134.18&#160;&#181;mol cm&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1) under low bias voltage.








Abstract
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) nitrate reduction shows substantial potential for solar&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia (NH3) conversion. However, low electron density and disordered electron conduction of conventional catalysts result in limited performance and low Faraday efficiency. Herein, a FePS2.66Li0.87 superionic conductor (SIC) is developed by introducing lithium ions into van der Waals immobile layered of FePS3 catalyst. This layered crystal framework facilitates high&#8208;concentration lithium ions confinement and long&#8208;range diffusion at room temperature, transitioning the conduction mechanism from electronic to mixed ionic/electronic. The typical nanofluidic ion transport leads to a high ionic conductivity of 16.4 mS cm&#8722;1 at room temperature and enhanced electronic conductivity of 5 &#215; 10&#8722;6 S cm&#8722;1. Furthermore, mobile lithium ions within interlayers enhance the interaction between the low&#8208;lying 3dyz orbitals of Fe interacting with 2a2 empty antibonding orbitals of NO3&#8722;. An excellent PEC ammonia production of 134.18&#160;&#181;mol cm&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1 with 96.95% Faradaic efficiency is achieved, and the corresponding solar&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 efficiency of 57.13% offers a promising pathway toward sustainable ammonia production.

         <title>Hierarchically Structured Porous Polyamide&#8208;Imide Membrane for Switchable Emulsion Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel amphiphilic polymer Torlon&#8208;based membrane with switchable superwettability is developed using a simple one&#8208;step phase separation method. Its hierarchical porous structure and surface reorganization enable exceptional oil&#8208;water separation with ultrahigh permeance and efficiency. The membrane exhibits excellent antifouling, self&#8208;cleaning, and durability, offering a scalable solution for advanced oily wastewater treatment and beyond.








Abstract
The development of advanced membranes with switchable superwettability has attracted considerable attention for the efficient treatment of oily wastewater. However, challenges persist in designing and fabricating such membranes through straightforward methods. In this study, a novel strategy is presented to design switchable superwettable membranes based on micro/nano&#8208;structured porous surfaces and surface chemical composition reorganization. A commercial amphiphilic polymer, polyamide&#8208;imide (Torlon), is fabricated into a porous symmetric membrane with a hierarchical surface structure using a one&#8208;step non&#8208;solvent&#8208;induced phase separation method. By leveraging the surface reorganization capability of amphiphilic polymers and the hierarchically porous structure, the resulting membranes demonstrate exceptional superamphiphilicity in air, underwater superoleophobicity, and underoil superhydrophobicity. These properties enable ultrahigh permeance and separation efficiency for oil&#8208;in&#8208;water, water&#8208;in&#8208;oil, and crude oil/water emulsions through a gravity&#8208;driven process, eliminating the need for external energy. Furthermore, the membranes exhibit excellent antifouling and self&#8208;cleaning performance, maintaining stable operation over multiple cycles. This work provides an innovative and scalable approach to next&#8208;generation switchable superwettable membranes with broad potential applications in oily wastewater treatment and beyond.

         <title>A Natural Lignification Inspired Super&#8208;Hard Wood&#8208;Based Composites with Extreme Resilience</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Super&#8208;hard wood&#8208;based composites (WBC) are designed and developed inspired by the mesoscale homogeneous lignification process intrinsic to tree growth. This innovative hybrid structure is achieved by leveraging the infusion of low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight phenol formaldehyde resin into the cell walls of thin wood slices, followed by a unique multi&#8208;layer construction and high&#8208;temperature compression.








Abstract
The growing demand for high&#8208;strength, durable materials capable of enduring extreme environments presents a significant challenge, particularly in balancing performance with sustainability. Conventional materials such as alloys and ceramics are nonrenewable, expensive, and require energy&#8208;intensive production processes. Here, super&#8208;hard wood&#8208;based composites (WBC) inspired by the meso&#8208;scale homogeneous lignification process intrinsic to tree growth are designed and developed. This hybrid structure is achieved innovatively by leveraging the infusion of low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight phenol formaldehyde resin into the cell walls of thin wood slices, followed by a unique multi&#8208;layer construction and high&#8208;temperature compression. The resulting composite exhibits remarkable properties, including a Janka hardness of 24&#160;382&#160;N and a Brinell hardness of 40.7&#160;HB, along with exceptional antipiercing performance. The created super&#8208;hard, sustainable materials address the limitations of nonrenewable resources while providing enhanced protection, structural stability, and exceptional resilience. The WBC approach aligns with UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by offering extra values for improving personal safety and building integrity across various engineering applications.

Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries
In article number 2502894, Shaoming Huang, Wei Zhang, and co&#8208;workers reveal a novel self&#8208;catalytic conversion reaction mechanism of N&#8208;doped CoTe2 composites (N&#8208;CoTe2/LTTC) incorporating 3D low&#8208;tortuosity tunneling structure, self&#8208;catalytic N&#8208;Co bonds, and heterojunction. Acting as the anode in potassium&#8208;ion batteries, the N&#8208;CoTe2/LTTC composite accelerates the catalytic conversion kinetics of potassium polytellurides (K5Te3 and K2Te) and achieves an ultralong&#8208;lifespan potassium storage performance over 25000 cycles.

Dew Water Harvesting by Laser Micropatterning
A metallic surface micropatterned with a laser achieves self&#8208;cooling capacity when it faces the night sky thanks to its enhanced infrared emissivity, which triggers water condensation similar to natural dew on leaves. The patterned microgrooves promote condensation as a continuous film rather than dispersed droplets, enabling an efficient and autonomous harvesting of dew water. More details ban be found in article number 2419472 by Pablo Pou&#8208;&#193;lvarez and co&#8208;workers.

         <title>Recent Progress in Oxygen Reduction Reaction Toward Hydrogen Peroxide Electrosynthesis and Cooperative Coupling of Anodic Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on the recent advances and regulation strategies in the 2e&#8315; ORR and is systematically structured into three main sections: 1) the latest progress of 2e&#8722; ORR in different reaction environments, especially in the acidic and neutral media; 2) microenvironmental modulation, and 3) the coupling system with cathodic 2e&#8722; ORR and other anodic reactions. This review aims to shed light on the exploration of efficient catalysts for 2e&#8211; ORR and systems for building a green energy roadmap.








Abstract
Electrosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) is a promising alternative to the anthraquinone oxidation process. To improve the overall energy efficiency and economic viability of this catalytic process, one pathway is to develop advanced catalysts to decrease the overpotential at the cathode, and the other is to couple 2e&#8722; ORR with certain anodic reactions to decrease the full cell voltage while producing valuable chemicals on both electrodes. The catalytic performance of a 2e&#8722; ORR catalyst depends not only on the material itself but also on the environmental factors. Developing promising electrocatalysts with high 2e&#8722; ORR selectivity and activity is a prerequisite for efficient H2O2 electrosynthesis, while coupling appropriate anodic reactions with 2e&#8722; ORR would further enhance the overall reaction efficiency. Considering this, here a comprehensive review is presented on the latest progress of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts of 2e&#8722; ORR in different media, the microenvironmental modulation mechanisms beyond catalyst design, as well as electrocatalytic system coupling 2e&#8722; ORR with various anodic oxidation reactions.

     alt="Recent Progress in Oxygen Reduction Reaction Toward Hydrogen Peroxide Electrosynthesis and Cooperative Coupling of Anodic Reactions"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This review focuses on the recent advances and regulation strategies in the 2e&#8315; ORR and is systematically structured into three main sections: 1) the latest progress of 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR in different reaction environments, especially in the acidic and neutral media; 2) microenvironmental modulation, and 3) the coupling system with cathodic 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR and other anodic reactions. This review aims to shed light on the exploration of efficient catalysts for 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR and systems for building a green energy roadmap.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) via two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR) is a promising alternative to the anthraquinone oxidation process. To improve the overall energy efficiency and economic viability of this catalytic process, one pathway is to develop advanced catalysts to decrease the overpotential at the cathode, and the other is to couple 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR with certain anodic reactions to decrease the full cell voltage while producing valuable chemicals on both electrodes. The catalytic performance of a 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR catalyst depends not only on the material itself but also on the environmental factors. Developing promising electrocatalysts with high 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR selectivity and activity is a prerequisite for efficient H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrosynthesis, while coupling appropriate anodic reactions with 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR would further enhance the overall reaction efficiency. Considering this, here a comprehensive review is presented on the latest progress of the state-of-the-art catalysts of 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR in different media, the microenvironmental modulation mechanisms beyond catalyst design, as well as electrocatalytic system coupling 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR with various anodic oxidation reactions. This review also presents new insights regarding the existing challenges and opportunities within this rapidly advancing field, along with viewpoints on the future development of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrosynthesis and the construction of green energy roadmaps.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>3D Bioprinting Models for Glioblastoma: From Scaffold Design to Therapeutic Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The schematic representation highlights the essential components for developing a 3D bioprinted glioblastoma model. It includes key microenvironmental factors, biomaterials, and crosslinking techniques. The integration of bioprinting strategies with GBM&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip models enables the creation of dynamic, physiologically relevant models. A Quality&#8208;by&#8208;Design (QbD) roadmap can ensure consistent 3D bioprinting models focusing on critical bioprinting processes and material properties.









Abstract
Conventional in vitro models fail to accurately mimic the tumor in vivo characteristics, being appointed as one of the causes of clinical attrition rate. Recent advances in 3D culture techniques, replicating essential physical and biochemical cues such as cell&#8211;cell and cell&#8211;extracellular matrix interactions, have led to the development of more realistic tumor models. Bioprinting has emerged to advance the creation of 3D in vitro models, providing enhanced flexibility, scalability, and reproducibility. This is crucial for the development of more effective drug treatments, and glioblastoma (GBM) is no exception. GBM, the most common and deadly brain cancer, remains a major challenge, with a median survival of only 15 months post&#8208;diagnosis. This review highlights the key components needed for 3D bioprinted GBM models. It encompasses an analysis of natural and synthetic biomaterials, along with crosslinking methods to improve structural integrity. Also, it critically evaluates current 3D bioprinted GBM models and their integration into GBM&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip platforms, which hold noteworthy potential for drug screening and personalized therapies. A versatile development framework grounded on Quality&#8208;by&#8208;Design principles is proposed to guide the design of bioprinting models. Future perspectives, including 4D bioprinting and machine learning approaches, are discussed, along with the current gaps to advance the field further.

         <title>Leaf Vein&#8208;Inspired Programmable Superstructure Liquid Metal Photothermal Actuator for Soft Robots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by plant leaf veins and pulp, this work introduced superstructure (ordered grooves) into liquid metal photothermal actuators for the first time and prepared LM@PI/PDMS programmable photothermal actuators with excellent comprehensive performance utilizing laser etching, including rapid oscillation, rapid response, strong load&#8208;carrying capacity, and excellent stability, which can be utilized to create versatile smart devices and robots.








Abstract
Asymmetric&#8208;expansion photothermal actuators have attracted the attention of researchers owing to their simple structure, superior stability, rapid response, and precise controllability. However, their response speed, deformation capacity, and load&#8208;carrying capacity are mutually constrained by their thickness. Inspired by the veins and pulp in plant leaves, this study uses laser etching to apply a superstructure of ordered grooves to liquid metal (LM) photothermal actuators. The resulting LM@low&#8208;expansion polyimide (4.52&#160;ppm K&#8722;1)/polydimethylsiloxane (LM@PI/PDMS) programmable photothermal actuators demonstrate exceptional performance, including a load&#8208;carrying capacity of 190 times their weight, a rapid oscillation frequency of 19&#160;Hz, a response speed of 60.96 &#177; 3.08&#176;/ s, and a bending angle of 159.05 &#177; 2.52&#176;. Hence, the proposed design resolves the inherent conflict between the load&#8208;carrying capacity and response speed. Furthermore, incorporating LM microspheres into actuators increases their stability and allows them to endure more than 20&#160;800 cycles without damage. The actuators are used to create versatile smart devices and robots, such as photothermally actuated robotic dogs that can function across various terrains. This study provides a novel strategy for the design and fabrication of programmable photothermal actuators and highlights their potential for applications in advanced robotics, which paves the way for their integration into complex environments.

         <title>Achieving a Record Photoluminescence Quantum Yield in Green Light&#8208;Emitting Carbon&#8208;Centered Radicals with Nanosecond Emission Lifetimes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon&#8208;centered radicals derived from N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene, which exhibit hybrid local and charge transfer states, can inhibit the nonradiative channels and open the radiative channels, thereby achieving a record photoluminescence quantum yield with a nanosecond lifetime in green light&#8208;emitting carbon&#8208;centered radicals. This work may open new avenues for designing high&#8208;efficiency doublet emitters in the green range.








Abstract
Organic luminescent radicals possess considerable potential for applications in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs)&#8208;based visible light communication owing to their intrinsic advantages of nanosecond emission lifetimes and spin&#8208;allowed radiative transitions. However, the inherently narrow energy bandgap and multiple nonradiative channels of organic radicals make it difficult to achieve efficient green and blue light&#8208;emitting, which is not conducive to applying visible light communication in diverse fields. In this study, a series of carbon&#8208;centered radicals derived from N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes are designed and synthesized, some of which exhibiting hybrid local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) states that resulting in efficient green emission. The results of photophysical characterizations and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the luminescence efficiency is closely related to their emission states. This relationship inhibits the nonradiative channels while simultaneously opening the radiative channels of organic radicals exhibiting HLCT states but not those with locally excited states. Intriguingly, a high photoluminescence quantum yield value of up to 70.1% at 534 nm is observed, which is the highest among green light&#8208;emitting carbon&#8208;centered radicals reported to date. Based on this exceptional result, an OLED device is fabricated and achieved an external quantum efficiency of 8.8%. These results demonstrate its potential application in electroluminescent devices.

         <title>Field&#8208;Free Perpendicular Magnetization Switching Through Topological Surface State in Type&#8208;II Dirac Semimetal Pt3Sn</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A full&#8208;scale field&#8208;free perpendicular magnetization switching driven by spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT) is achieved by employing an ultrathin type&#8208;II Dirac semimetal, Pt3Sn. The generation of unconventional SOT is attributed to the spin texture of the topological surface state on the Pt3Sn (111) surface with a z&#8208;polarized spin component. This study positions the Dirac semimetals, such as Pt3Sn, as promising spin sources for integration into advanced spintronic devices.








Abstract
Spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT) induced by current is a promising approach for electrical manipulation of magnetization in advancing next&#8208;generation memory and logic technologies. Conventional SOT&#8208;driven perpendicular magnetization switching typically requires an external magnetic field for symmetry breaking, limiting practical applications. Recent research has focused on achieving field&#8208;free switching through out&#8208;of&#8208;plane SOT, with the key challenge being the exploration of new spin source materials that can generate z&#8208;polarized spins with high charge&#8208;to&#8208;spin conversion efficiency, structural simplicity, and scalability for large&#8208;scale production. This study demonstrates field&#8208;free perpendicular switching using an ultrathin type&#8208;II Dirac semimetal Pt3Sn layer with a topological surface state. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the unconventional SOT originates from a spin texture with C3v symmetry, leading to significant z&#8208;polarized spin accumulation in the Pt3Sn (111) surface, enabling the deterministic switching of perpendicular magnetization. These results highlight the potential of Dirac semimetals like Pt3Sn as scalable and efficient spin sources, facilitating the development of low&#8208;power, high&#8208;density spintronic memory and logic devices.

         <title>Improved Facet and Edge Passivation in Near&#8208;Infrared III&#8208;V Colloidal Quantum Dot Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Increasing InAs CQD size exposes diverse facets and edges, bringing challenges for effective passivation. This work introduces a mixed&#8208;halide passivation strategy to stabilize these facets and edges, doubling anti&#8208;oxidation ability and boosting mobility. The resulting photodetectors achieve 75% EQE, 10 ns response time, and 50&#160;h operational stability (10% loss) at 1140 nm, advancing InAs CQD photodetector performance.








Abstract
Lead&#8208;free III&#8208;V colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are of significant interest for their potential in near&#8208;infrared (NIR) to short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) photodetection. However, achieving effective surface passivation remains challenging, especially as larger CQD sizes introduce more complex surface facets and compositions while shifting the absorption peak from the NIR to the SWIR range. In this study, a mixed&#8208;halide passivation strategy is developed for large InAs CQDs, an approach that led to a doubling in anti&#8208;oxidation ability and achieves a hole mobility of 0.03 cm2&#160;Vs&#8722;1. These in turn led to a T90 lifetime of 50&#160;h and enhanced operating stability in photodetectors operating at 1140&#160;nm. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations and facet characterization indicate that exposed facets and edges are well passivated using a mixture of indium halides, which provide a stronger desorption energy compared to single&#8208;halide passivation. This approach yields photodetectors with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 75% and a response time of 10&#160;ns, an advance for InAs photodetectors operating at 1140&#160;nm.

         <title>Van der Waals Ferroelectric CuCrP2S6&#8208;Enabled Hysteresis&#8208;Free Negative Capacitance Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores 2D ferroelectric CuCrP2S6 for developing advanced NC&#8208;FET technology. Using MoS2 as the channel material, NC&#8208;FETs with optimized capacitance matching conditions achieve ultra&#8208;steep subthreshold swings (12 mV dec&#8722;1) and negligible hysteresis. A resistor&#8208;loaded inverter operating at 0.2 V with hysteresis&#8208;free characteristics highlights the potential of engineered 2D ferroelectrics for next&#8208;generation low&#8208;power electronics.








Abstract
The relentless pursuit of miniaturization and reduced power consumption in information technology demands innovative device architectures. Negative capacitance field&#8208;effect transistors (NC&#8208;FETs) offer a promising solution by harnessing the negative capacitance effect of ferroelectric materials to amplify gate voltage and achieve steep subthreshold swings (SS). In this work, 2D van der Waals (vdW) ferroelectric CuCrP2S6 (CCPS) is employed as the gate dielectric to realize hysteresis&#8208;free NC&#8208;FETs technology. Scanning microwave impedance microscopy (sMIM) is employed to investigate the dielectric property of CCPS, revealing a thickness&#8208;independent dielectric constant of &#8776;35. Subsequently, NC&#8208;FETs are fabricated with MoS2 channel, and the capacitance matching conditions are meticulously investigated. The optimized devices exhibit simultaneously ultra&#8208;steep SS (&#8776;12&#160;mV dec&#8722;1) and negligible hysteresis, with immunity to both voltage scan range and scan rate. Finally, a resistor&#8208;loaded inverter is demonstrated manifesting a low operation voltage down to 0.2&#160;V and hysteresis&#8208;free transfer characteristics. This work paves the way for the development of high&#8208;performance, low&#8208;power electronics by exploiting 2D vdW ferroelectric materials.

The miniaturized and portable bio&#8208;battery, fabricated by 3&#8208;D printing of living hydrogels containing electroactive Shewanella oneidensis MR&#8208;1 biofilms, represents a novel class of engineered living energy materials. The electricity generated by this device can be harnessed for nerve stimulation to enable precise control over bioelectrical stimulation and physiological blood pressure signals.








Abstract
Harnessing engineered living materials for energy application represents a promising avenue to sustainable energy conversion and storage, with bio&#8208;batteries emerging as a pivotal direction for sustainable power supply. Whereas, the realization of miniaturized and portable bio&#8208;battery orchestrating off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf devices remains a significant challenge. Here, this work reports the development of a miniaturized and portable bio&#8208;battery using living hydrogels containing conductive biofilms encapsulated in an alginate matrix for nerve stimulation. These hydrogels, which can be 3&#8208;D printed into customized geometries, retained biologically active characteristics, including electroactivity that facilitates electron generation and the reduction of graphene oxide. By fabricating the living hydrogel into a standard 2032 battery shell with a diameter of 20&#160;mm, this work successfully creates a miniaturized and portable bio&#8208;battery with self&#8208;charging performance. The device demonstrates remarkable electrochemical performance with a coulombic efficiency of 99.5% and maintains high cell viability exceeding 90% after operation. Notably, the electricity generated by the bio&#8208;battery can be harnessed for nerve stimulation to enable precise control over bioelectrical stimulation and physiological blood pressure signals. This study paves the way for the development of novel, compact, and portable bio&#8208;energy devices with immense potential for future advancements in sustainable energy technologies.

         <title>Creating Vacancy Strong Interaction to Enable Homogeneous High&#8208;Throughput Ion Transport for Efficient Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>

Creating sulfur&#8208;vacancy&#8208;rich tungsten sulfide into composite polymer electrolyte enables homogeneous high&#8208;throughput Li&#8208;ion transport (ultra&#8208;high ionic conductivity of 1.9 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 at 25 &#176;C) and uniform lithium deposition (ultra&#8208;long lifetime of over 5500 h in Li||Li cells). The sulfurized polyacrylonitrile||Li solid pouch cell exhibits an initial discharge&#8208;specific capacity of 1048 mAh g&#8722;1, resulting in a total capacity of 0.524 Ah.








Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes are emerging as a key component for solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries, offering a promising combination of large&#8208;scale processability and high safety. However, challenges remain, including limited ion transport and the unstable solid electrolyte interphase, which result in unsatisfactory ionic conductivity and uncontrollable lithium dendrite growth. To address these issues, a high&#8208;throughput Li&#8208;ion transport pathway is developed by incorporating tungsten sulfide enriched with sulfur vacancies (SVs) into a poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene)&#8208;based composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs). The SVs strong interaction in the CPEs facilitates homogeneous high&#8208;throughput Li&#8208;ion transport 1.9 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 at 25 &#176;C) by enhancing the dissociation of lithium salts and effectively creates ample interfaces with the polymer chains to reduce the formation of inner vacuities. Moreover, the SVs confine FSI&#8722; anions, while the electron&#8208;rich environment induced by sulfur atoms promotes the preferential degradation of bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide anions, ensuring uniform lithium deposition. This fosters the formation of inorganic nanocrystals on the lithium anode and effectively suppresses dendrite growth, enabling an ultra&#8208;long lifetime of over 5500 h in Li||Li symmetric cells. When paired with sulfurized polyacrylonitrile cathode, a pouch cell capacity of 0.524 Ah is achieved, demonstrating the effectiveness of a homogeneous, high&#8208;throughput Li&#8208;ions transport mechanism.

         <title>Efficient Autonomous Dew Water Harvesting by Laser Micropatterning: Superhydrophilic and High Emissivity Robust Grooved Metallic Surfaces Enabling Filmwise Condensation and Radiative Cooling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Laser micropatterning is presented as a promising technology in the search for autonomous dew water harvesting materials. Laser&#8208;grooved metallic surfaces achieve simultaneously high infrared emissivity and superhydrophilicity, which gives them self&#8208;cooling properties under atmospheric radiative deficit and the ability to condense water in an efficient filmwise fashion. An autonomous dew water harvesting system based on those surfaces yields remarkable results.








Abstract
The present work explores a unique yet unexplored synergy between the properties of laser micropatterned metallic surfaces and the requirements for an autonomous dew water harvesting candidate material. Laser&#8208;patterned aluminum surfaces achieved simultaneously high infrared emissivity (up to 0.95 in the atmospheric window) and superhydrophilic wettability (water contact angle of 0&#176;), key properties enabling passive radiative cooling and filmwise condensation dynamics respectively. The generation of micrometric&#8208;sized grooves during laser processing plays a fundamental role in both properties, as they provide a broadband enhancement of the emissivity based on multiscale topographies and oxide layers, while limiting the growth of the water film during condensation through strong capillary wicking forces. As a result, the patterned aluminum surfaces display self&#8208;cooling capacities under radiative deficit conditions as well as low water retention levels (three times lower than the untreated dropwise condensation counterparts). The promising results obtained lead to the construction and evaluation of a real size outdoors autonomous dew water harvesting system based on those surfaces, demonstrating the scalability of the technology. A 70% improvement in the collected dew water in comparison to a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art reference material is consistently measured during 1&#8208;year outdoor study, proving the robustness of the surfaces and their performance.

         <title>Stable and Efficient Indoor Photovoltaics Through Novel Dual&#8208;Phase 2D Perovskite Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The application of 2D perovskite materials in indoor photovoltaic field is studied. By constructing DJ/RP perovskite heterojunction, an optimal balance between defect passivation and carrier transport is achieved. Ultimately, the 2D PSCs attain a PCE of 30.30%, with working stability improved by a factor of 20 compared to 3D PSCs, demonstrating their significant potential in future indoor photovoltaic technology.








Abstract
2D perovskite materials are ideal candidates for indoor photovoltaic (IPV) applications due to their tunable bandgap, high absorption coefficients, and enhanced stability. However, attaining uniform crystallization and overcoming low carrier mobility remain key challenges for 2D perovskites, limiting their overall performance. In this study, a 2D perovskite light&#8208;absorbing layer is constructed using a Dion&#8211;Jacobson (DJ)&#8208;phase EDA(FA)4Pb5I16 (n = 5) and introduced butylammonium iodide (BAI) for interface modification, thereby creating a novel DJ/Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) dual 2D perovskite heterostructure. By adjusting the thickness of the BAI&#8208;based perovskite layer, the relationship between interfacial defect states and carrier mobility is investigated under varying indoor light intensities. The results indicate that, by achieving a balance between interfacial defect passivation and carrier transport, the optimized 2D perovskite device reaches a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 30.30% and an open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 936&#160;mV under 1000 lux (3000 K LED). 2D&#8208;DJ/RP perovskite IPV exhibits a twentyfold increase in T90 lifetime compared to 3D perovskite devices. It is the first time to systematically study 2D perovskites in IPV applications, demonstrating that rationally designed and optimized 2D perovskites hold significant potential for fabricating high&#8208;performance indoor PSCs.

         <title>Manipulating Interfacial Water Via Metallic Pt1Co6 Sites on Self&#8208;Adaptive Metal Phosphides to Enhance Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique electrocatalyst featuring singly dispersed Pt&#8211;Co sites in a fully metallic state on nanoporous Co2P, which confers exceptional activity and durability for the hydrogen evolution reaction, enabling high&#8208;performance anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane water electrolyser, is reported. Real&#8208;time monitoring reveals that these sites self&#8208;adaptively distort under operating conditions to form a Pt1Co6 configuration with strongly negative charge, optimizing reactant binding and reorganizing the interfacial water structure.








Abstract
Metallizing active sites to control the structural and kinetic dissociation of water at the catalyst&#8211;electrolyte interface, along with elucidating its mechanism under operating conditions, is a pivotal innovation for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, a design of singly dispersed Pt&#8211;Co sites in a fully metallic state on nanoporous Co2P, tailored for HER, is introduced. An anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane water electrolyzer equipped with this catalyst can achieve the industrial current densities of 1.0 and 2.0 A cm&#8722;2 at 1.71 and 1.85&#160;V, respectively. It is revealed that the singly dispersed Pt&#8211;Co sites undergo self&#8208;adaptive distortion under operating conditions, which form a Pt1Co6 configuration with a strongly negative charge that optimizes reactant binding and reorganizes the interfacial water structure, resulting in an improved concentration of potassium (K+) ions in the closest ion plane. The K+ ions interact cooperatively with H2O (K&#183;H2O), which strengthens the Pt&#8211;H binding interaction and facilitates the polarization of the H&#9472;OH bond, leading to improved HER activity. This study not only propels the advancement of cathodic catalysts for water electrolysis but also delineates a metallization strategy and an interface design principle, thereby enhancing electrocatalytic reaction rates.

         <title>Enhanced Reversibility of Iron Metal Anode with a Solid Electrolyte Interphase in Concentrated Chloride Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The low plating&#8208;stripping Coulombic efficiency of the iron metal anode is a major barrier for next&#8208;generation Fe&#8208;ion batteries. Introducing a high concentration of ZnCl2 to the FeCl2&#8208;based electrolyte makes the solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase&#8208;enabling dimethyl carbonate miscible to the electrolyte. The hybrid electrolyte exhibits an average Coulombic efficiency of 98.3% and a more stable cycle life.








Abstract
Iron is a promising candidate for a cost&#8208;effective anode for large&#8208;scale energy storage systems due to its natural abundance and well&#8208;established mass production. Recently, Fe&#8208;ion batteries (FeIBs) that use ferrous ions as the charge carrier have emerged as a potential storage solution. The electrolytes in FeIBs are necessarily acidic to render the ferrous ions more anodically stable, allowing a wide operation voltage window. However, the iron anode suffers severe hydrogen evolution reaction with a low Coulombic efficiency (CE) in an acidic environment, shortening the battery cycle life. Herein, a hybrid aqueous electrolyte that forms a solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer on the Fe anode surface is introduced. The electrolyte mainly comprises FeCl2 and ZnCl2 as cosalts, where the Zn&#8208;Cl anionic complex species of the concentrated ZnCl2 allows dimethyl carbonate (DMC) to be miscible with the aqueous ferrous electrolyte. SEI derived from DMC's decomposition passivates the iron surface, which leads to an average CE of 98.3% and much&#8208;improved cycling stability. This advancement shows the promise of efficient and durable FeIBs.

         <title>Binary Electrolyte Additive&#8208;Reinforced Interfacial Molecule Adsorption Layer for Ultra&#8208;Stable Zinc Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A natural binary electrolyte additive is designed to achieve an enhanced interfacial molecule adsorption layer for Zn protection via reshaping the electric double&#8208;layer structure. Consequently, the hydrogen evolution reaction is suppressed and a robust inorganic solid electrolyte interphase is constructed for dendrite&#8208;free Zn plating. The zinc ion hybrid capacitor with binary additive demonstrates an exceptional lifespan of over 100&#160;000 cycles.









Abstract
Aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs) face challenges due to the limited interface stability of Zn anode, which includes uncontrolled hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and excessive dendrite growth. In this study, a natural binary additive composed of saponin and anisaldehyde is introduced to create a stable interfacial adsorption layer for Zn protection via reshaping the electric double layer (EDL) structure. Saponin with rich hydroxyl and carboxyl groups serves as &#8220;anchor points&#8221;, promoting the adsorption of anisaldehyde through intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Meanwhile, anisaldehyde, with a unique aldehyde group, enhances HER suppression by preferentially facilitating electrocatalytic coupling with H* in the EDL, leading to the formation of a robust inorganic solid electrolyte interphase that prevents dendrite formation, and structural evolution of anisaldehyde during Zn deposition process is verified. As a result, the Zn||Zn symmetric cells present an ultra&#8208;long cycling lifespan of 3&#160;400&#160;h at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 1&#160;700&#160;h at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Even at the current density of 20&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, the cells demonstrate reversible operations for 450&#160;h. Furthermore, Zn&#8208;ion hybrid capacitors exhibit a remarkable lifespan of 100&#160;000 cycles. This work presents a simple synergetic strategy to enhance anode/electrolyte interfacial stability, highlighting its potential for Zn anode protection in high&#8208;performance AZIBs.

         <title>Ir/Mn Co&#8208;Mixing and Oxide&#8208;Support Interaction Modulation Through Plasma Promoted Asymmetric Oxygen Coupling for Stable Acidic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy that integrates the Ir/Mn co&#8208;mixing and the strong oxide&#8208;support interaction modulation through plasma defect engineering is used for the development of the catalysts that follow the oxide path mechanism for the oxygen&#8208;evolution reaction (OER). The obtained catalyst shows exceptional OER activity and remarkable stability in the acid media.








Abstract
Developing efficient and stable catalysts that facilitate the oxygen&#8208;evolution reaction (OER) through an oxide&#8208;path mechanism (OPM) is of considerable interest. However, it remains a significant challenge due to the stringent structural requirements of these catalysts. This work reports that using a strategy that integrates the Ir/Mn co&#8208;mixing and the strong oxide&#8208;support interaction (SOSI) modulation, efficient and stable Ir&#8208;based catalysts that follow the OPM for the acidic OER can be developed. The strategy mainly relies on optimizing the distance of oxygeneous intermediate adsorption sites by the Ir/Mn co&#8208;mixing and modulating the SOSI of the catalysts through plasma defect engineering to trigger the OPM pathway with a lower energy barrier. The density&#8208;functional&#8208;theory (DFT) calculations reveal a strong electronic coupling between Ir and Mn via the Ir&#9472;O&#9472;Mn bond and a ready coupling of oxygeneous adsorbed on the Ir site with those on the Mn site, leading to an asymmetric oxygen coupling for the OER. The developed catalyst merely requires an overpotential of 240&#160;mV to drive 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with the Ir mass&#8208;activity &gt;&#160;75 times higher than that of the IrO2. When used in the proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane water&#8208;electrolyzers, it shows high performance and excellent stability at an industrial&#8208;level current density of 1.0 A cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Molecular Stitching in Polysaccharide Precursor for Fabricating Hard Carbon with Ultra&#8208;High Plateau Capacity of Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work opens the avenue to molecular&#8208;level modulation in organic precursors for developing high&#8208;performance hard carbon in sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The highly cross&#8208;linked polymeric network in the precursor is constructed by unique molecular stitching strategy. The network evolves into highly twisted graphitic lattices with abundant&#160;closed ultramicro&#8208;pores (&lt;0.3 nm), thereby&#160;enabling the storage of massive sodium clusters in hard carbon.








Abstract
High energy density of sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) requires high low&#8208;voltage capacity and initial Coulombic efficiency for hard carbon. However, simultaneously achieving both characteristics is a substantial challenge. Herein, a unique molecular stitching strategy is proposed to edit the polymeric structure of common starch for synthesizing cost&#8208;effective hard carbon (STHC&#8208;MS). A mild air&#8208;heating treatment toward starch is employed to trigger the esterification reaction between carboxyl and hydroxy groups, which can effectively connect the branched polysaccharide chains thereby constructing a highly cross&#8208;linked polymeric network. In contrast with the pristine branched&#8208;chain starch, the cross&#8208;linking structured precursor evolves into highly twisted graphitic lattices creating a large population of closed ultramicro&#8208;pores (&lt;0.3&#160;nm) enabling the storage of massive sodium clusters. Resultantly, STHC&#8208;MS delivers a reversible capacity of 348 mAh g&#8722;1 with a remarkable low&#8208;voltage (below 0.1&#160;V) capacity of 294 mAh g&#8722;1, which becomes more attractive by combining the high initial Coulombic efficiency of 93.3%. Moreover, STHC&#8208;MS exhibits outstanding stability of 0.008% decay per cycle over 4800 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1. STHC&#8208;MS||Na3V2(PO3)4 full cells achieve an energy density of 266&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, largely surpassing the commercial hard carbon&#8208;based counterpart. This work opens the avenue of molecular&#8208;level modulation in organic precursors for developing high&#8208;performance hard carbon in SIBs.

         <title>Dynamic Bonding for In&#8208;Situ Welding of Multilayer Elastomers Enables High&#8208;Performance Wearable Electronics for Machine Learning&#8208;Assisted Active Rehabilitation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>

This work proposes an in&#8208;situ self&#8208;welding strategy that uses dynamic hydrogen bonds to integrate multilayer conductive elastomers into robust wearable electronics with superior structural stability and excellent pressure&#8208;sensing performance. The data reflecting resistance training are collected by the welded electronics and further analysed and classified by machine learning models, which enables home&#8208;based active rehabilitation.








Abstract
Patients with hand dysfunction require joint rehabilitation for functional restoration, and wearable electronics can provide physical signals to assess and guide the process. However, most wearable electronics are susceptible to failure under large deformations owing to instability in the layered structure, thereby weakening signal reliability. Herein, an in&#8208;situ self&#8208;welding strategy that uses dynamic hydrogen bonds at interfaces to integrate conductive elastomer layers into highly robust electronics is proposed. This strategy enables the interlocking of functional layers with different microstructures, achieving high interfacial toughness (e.g., &#8776;700&#160;J&#160;m&#8722;2 for micropyramid layer with the smallest welding areas) and preventing structural failure. The welded electronics exhibit excellent pressure&#8208;sensing performance, including high sensitivity, a wide sensing range, and excellent long&#8208;term stability, surpassing those of the unwelded electronics. This enables a reliable collection of comprehensive pressure signals during joint rehabilitation, which is beneficial for assessing the rehabilitation levels of a patient. Furthermore, a machine learning&#8208;assisted system using t&#8208;distributed stochastic neighbor embedding and artificial neural network models to facilitate home&#8208;based active rehabilitation is established, which reduces the need for frequent hospital visits. This system analyzes and quantifies rehabilitation levels in a timely manner, allowing patients to adjust training programs autonomously, thereby accelerating the rehabilitation process.

         <title>Shape&#8208;Controlled Reversible Li Plating&#8208;Stripping for Stable and High&#8208;Rate Anode&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A shape change&#8208;free and lithium&#8208;free anode composed of highly ordered hollow ZnO matrix with surface&#8208;protective LiPON layer is developed, which achieves a highly reversible Li plating/stripping inside the matrix cavity for long life&#8208;span anode&#8208;free lithium metal batteries with high energy density.









Abstract
Anode&#8208;free lithium metal batteries are promising toward high&#8208;energy&#8208;density power sources with low&#8208;cost, but their practical applications are challenged by poor cycling stability and low rate capability. Herein, a shape change&#8208;free and lithium&#8208;free anode that well controls the reversible Li plating&#8208;stripping is reported, which is composed of a highly&#8208;ordered hollow ZnO matrix with a surface&#8208;coated lithium&#8208;phosphorus&#8208;oxynitride (LiPON) layer. The ZnO matrix supplies sufficient cavities and lithiophilic sites to facilitate uniform Li plating/stripping within the hollow cavity, while the LiPON layer maintains stable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase from mechanical and electrochemical damage. As a result, lithium is constrained within the cavity and the overall anode shape is effectively controlled during long&#8208;term and high&#8208;rate cycling. The assembled half&#8208;cell stably works at 1.2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for 335 cycles with Coulombic efficiency of 98.8%. Without Li pre&#8208;deposition, full&#8208;cells using modified&#8208;LiFePO4 and LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 cathodes demonstrate 150&#8208;cycles lifespan and high energy density of 617&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at 2C rate.

         <title>Operando Magnetism on Oxygen Redox Process in Li&#8208;Rich Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ magnetism measurement is employed to investigate the magnetic/electronic structure evolution in the Li&#8208;rich cathode. The magnetization changes demonstrate that charge storage behavior originates from synergistic transition metal spin&#8208;state variation and &#960;&#8208;to&#8208;&#963; interaction evolution, and further elucidate the internal origin of capacity decay during cycling. The Mn&#9472;O orbital model provides potential criteria for oxygen redox, guiding rational design of anionic redox&#8208;based cathodes.








Abstract
Oxide ions in lithium&#8208;rich layered oxides can store charge at high voltage and offer a viable route toward the higher energy density batteries. However, the underlying oxygen redox mechanism in such materials still remains elusive at present. In this work, a precise in situ magnetism measurement is employed to monitor real&#8208;time magnetization variation associated with unpaired electrons in Li1.2Mn0.6Ni0.2O2 cathode material, enabling the investigation on magnetic/electronic structure evolution in electrochemical cycling. The magnetization gradually decreases except for a weak upturn above 4.6&#160;V during the initial charging process. According to the comprehensive analyses of various in/ex situ characterizations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the magnetization rebound can be attributed to the interaction evolution of lattice oxygen from &#960;&#8208;type delocalized Mn&#9472;O coupling to &#963;&#8208;type O&#9472;O dimerization bonding. Moreover, the magnetization amplitude attenuation after long&#8208;term cycles provides important evidence for the irreversible structure transition and capacity fading. The oxygen redox mechanism concluded by in situ magnetism characterization can be generalized to other electrode materials with an anionic redox process and provide pivotal guidance for designing advanced high&#8208;performance cathode materials.

         <title>Emergent Multiple Spin States From Baromagnetic Effect in Strongly Correlated Magnet Mn&#8323;GaC</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In kagome lattice magnet Mn&#8323;GaC, controllable multiple spin states with giant baro&#8208;magnetoresistance effect, which can enhance magnetic storage, are achieved by manipulating spin rotation within the spin&#8208;polarized plane through applied pressure. These multiple spin states originate from the synergistic mechanism between spin frustration and spin polarization.








Abstract
Strongly correlated magnets, exhibiting distinctive spin properties such as spin&#8208;orbit coupling, spin polarization, and chiral spin, are regarded as the next&#8208;generation high&#8208;density magnetic storage materials in spintronics. Nevertheless, owing to intricate spin interactions, realizing controllable spin arrangement and high&#8208;density magnetic storage remains a formidable challenge. Here, controllable multiple spin states induced by the baromagnetic effect in kagome lattice magnet Mn&#8323;GaC are first reported, achieved by manipulating spin rotation within the spin&#8208;polarized plane employing pressure. Neutron diffraction refinement and specific heat measurements under pressure, combined with first&#8208;principles calculations, demonstrate that multiple spin states are originating from the synergistic mechanism between spin frustration and spin polarization related to the lifting of degeneracy in electronic microstates. Electrical transport measurements under pressure reveal that multiple spin states exhibit giant baro&#8208;magnetoresistance effect, enabling enhanced storage density in spintronics via multi&#8208;logic state applications. Integrating the pressure response and microscopic behaviors of spins, a comprehensive p&#8208;T&#8208;H phase diagram is constructed, offering a novel and robust framework for multi&#8208;logic states. These findings provide critical insights into controllable spin states, opening a new avenue for high&#8208;density magnetic storage through multiple spin states.

         <title>Discovery of a New Cu&#8208;Based Chalcogenide with High zT Near Room Temperature: Low&#8208;Cost Alternative for the Bi2Te3&#8208;Based Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports the discovery of a stable &#947;&#8208;phase in Cu6Te3&#8208;xS1+x, achieving high thermoelectric performance with a Seebeck coefficient up to 200 &#181;VK&#8315;&#185; and ultralow thermal conductivity (&#8776;0.25 Wm&#8315;&#185;K&#8315;&#185;). The material eliminates phase transitions, exhibits a zT of &#8776;1.1 at 500 K, and offers a cost&#8208;effective, eco&#8208;friendly alternative for waste heat recovery and cooling applications.








Abstract
Copper&#8208;based chalcogenides are cost&#8208;effective and environmentally friendly thermoelectric (TE) materials for waste heat recovery. Despite demonstrating excellent thermoelectric performance, binary Cu2X (X&#160;=&#160;S, Se, and Te) chalcogenides undergo superionic phase transitions above room temperature, leading to microstructural evolution and unstable properties. In this work, a new &#947;&#8208;phase of Cu6Te3&#8208;xS1+x (0&#160;&lt;&#160;x &#8804;&#160;1) is discovered, a narrow&#8208;bandgap semiconductor with outstanding thermoelectric performance and high stability.

The &#947;&#8208;phase exhibits a significantly higher Seebeck coefficient of up to 200&#160;&#181;VK&#8722;1 compared to 8.8&#160;&#181;VK&#8722;1 for Cu6Te3S at room temperature due to optimized carrier concentration and increased effective mass. Cu6Te3&#8208;xS1+x materials also demonstrate ultralow thermal conductivity (&#8776;0.25 Wm&#8722;1K&#8722;1), which, in concert with improved power factors, enables a high zT of &#8776;1.1 at a relatively low temperature of 500&#160;K.

The developed Cu6Te3&#8208;xS1+x is a promising candidate for thermoelectric converters in waste heat recovery, and its potential can be further extended to cooling applications through carrier concentration tuning.

&lt;p&gt;Copper-based chalcogenides are cost-effective and environmentally friendly thermoelectric (TE) materials for waste heat recovery. Despite demonstrating excellent thermoelectric performance, binary Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;&#160;=&#160;S, Se, and Te) chalcogenides undergo superionic phase transitions above room temperature, leading to microstructural evolution and unstable properties. In this work, a new &#947;-phase of Cu&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3-&lt;/sub&gt;

         <title>Phase and Orbital Engineering Effectuating Efficient Adsorption and Catalysis toward High&#8208;Energy Lithium&#8722;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The c&#8208;B&#8208;Mo2C catalyst, constructed through a phase and orbital engineering strategy, significantly enhances its catalytic activity by restructuring the basal surface for the conversion of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. Consequently, c&#8208;B&#8208;Mo2C&#8208;based batteries exhibit elevated capacity, excellent rate capability, and stable cycling life.








Abstract
The delicate construction of electrocatalysts with high catalytic activity is a strategic method to enhance the kinetics of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs). Adjusting the local structure of the catalyst is always crucial for understanding the structure&#8211;activity relationship between atomic structure and catalyst performance. Here, in situ induction of electron&#8208;deficient B enables phase engineering Mo2C, realizing the transition from hexagonal (h&#8208;Mo2C) to cubic phase (c&#8208;B&#8208;Mo2C). Meanwhile, the empty sp3 orbital of B favors the effective bonding with electron&#8208;rich sulfur, creates a more valid orbital engineering available. Relying on the binary engineering via B doping, the adsorption and conversion of polysulfides are promoted. Hence, the c&#8208;B&#8208;Mo2C based cell achieves a low&#8208;capacity degradation of 0.04% with the coulombic efficiency exceeding 99.8% in 1000 cycles. Uniform Li+ transport is consistently achieved at 2 mA cm&#8722;2 for over 600 h. A 6.67Ah&#8208;c&#8208;B&#8208;Mo2C based pouch cell has a high energy density of up to 502.1 Wh kg&#8722;1 (E/S ratio of 2.4 &#181;L mg S&#8722;1), while the pouch cell of 2 Ah exhibits an energy density of 372 Wh kg&#8722;1 more than 100 cycles. This study takes advantage of the combined engineering method to provide a guiding approach for elevating the activity of the electrocatalysts rationally.

         <title>Traversing the Periodic Table through Phase&#8208;Separating Nanoreactors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Centimeter&#8208;scale arrays of single nanoparticles, generated through either Dip Pen Nanolithography or Polymer Pen Lithography, allow for the discovery of novel nanomaterials at an unprecedented scale. The development of phase&#8208;separating hydrophobic nanoreactors bypasses element&#8208;specific chemistry limitations, enabling the synthesis of polyelemental metal and metal oxide nanoparticle megalibraries from at least 52 metal elements with an almost infinite number of chemical combinations in a single experiment.








Abstract
Phase&#8208;separating nanoreactors, generated through either Dip Pen Nanolithography (DPN)&#160;or Polymer Pen Lithography (PPL) and capable of single nanoparticle formation, are compatible with almost every relevant element from the periodic table. This advance overcomes one of the most daunting limitations in high throughput materials discovery, specifically enabling the synthesis of broad swaths of the materials genome. Indeed, the platform is compatible with at least 52 metal elements of interest and almost an infinite number of combinations. In particular, it is discovered that surface&#8208;confined, attoliter&#8208;volume reactors made of polystyrene (PS) mixtures can be preloaded with metal salts spanning all but the alkali metals and subsequently transformed into single&#8208; or multi&#8208;component nanoparticles of well&#8208;defined dimensions. This is done in a three&#8208;step process, which initially involves the facilitation of precursor precipitation and localization with toluene vapor, followed by plasma treatment to remove the polymer reactor component, and then heating from 400&#8211;900&#160;&#176;C, depending upon precursor and desired end&#8208;state (degree of reduction and crystallinity). These phase&#8208;separating nanoreactors are used to produce metal and metal oxide nanoparticles, depending upon conditions, in a substrate&#8208;general manner.

         <title>Chiral Pseudogap Metal Emerging from a Disordered Van der Waals Mott Insulator 1T&#8208;TaS2 &#8722; xSex</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intriguing metal was discovered in a chiral charge density wave material, 1T&#8208;TaS2. The random substitution of S by Se induces a transition from an insulator to a metal with a strongly suppressed electron density at the Fermi energy. The pseudogap comes from electronic disorder on with substantial electron correlation and exhibits unprecedented chirality, which may induce exotic superconductivity. 








Abstract
The emergence of a pseudogap is a hallmark of anomalous electronic states formed through substantial manybody interaction but the mechanism of the pseudogap formation and its role in related emerging quantum states such as unconventional superconductivity remain largely elusive. Here, the emergence of an unusual pseudogap in a representative van der Waals chiral charge density wave (CDW) materials with strong electron correlation, 1T&#8208;TaS2 is reported, through isoelectronic substitute of S. The evolution of electronic band dispersions of 1T&#8208;TaS2 &#8722; xSex (0 &#10877; x &#10877; 2) is systematically investigated using angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). The results show that the Se substitution induces a quantum transition from an insulating to a pseudogap metallic phase with the CDW order preserved. Moreover, the asymmetry of the pseudogap spectral function is found, which reflects the chiral nature of CDW structure. The present observation is contrasted with the previous suggestions of a Mott transition driven by band width control or charge transfer. Instead, the pseudogap phase is attributed to a disordered Mott insulator in line with the recent observation of substantial lateral electronic disorder. These findings provide a unique electronic system with chiral pseudogap, where the complex interplay between CDW, chirality, disorder, and electronic correlation may lead to unconventional emergent&#160;physics.

         <title>Orbital Matching Mechanism&#8208;Guided Synthesis of Cu&#8208;Based Single Atom Alloys for Acidic CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple yet intuitive d&#8208;p orbital matching mechanism is proposed for assessing the atomic dispersion stability of Cu&#8208;based single atom alloys (SAAs). This theoretical framework offers electronic orbital insights into stability factors and is universally applicable for designing stable SAAs. The designed SAAs are experimentally demonstrated with enhanced mono&#8208;carbon product selectivity in a prototype reaction&#8212;acidic CO2 electroreduction.








Abstract
Recent advancements in alloy catalysis have yield novel materials with tailored functionalities. Among these, Cu&#8208;based single&#8208;atom alloy (SAA) catalysts have attracted significant attention in catalytic applications for their unique electronic structure and geometric ensemble effects. However, selecting alloying atoms with robust dispersion stability on the Cu substrate is challenging, and has mostly been practiced empirically. The fundamental bottleneck is that the microscopic mechanism that governs the dispersion stability is unclear, and a comprehensive approach for designing Cu&#8208;based SAA systems with simultaneous dispersion stability and high catalytic activity is still missing. Here, combining theory and experiment, a simple yet intuitive d&#8208;p orbital matching mechanism is discovered for rapid assessment of the atomic dispersion stability of Cu&#8208;based SAAs, exhibiting its universality and extensibility for screening effective SAAs across binary, ternary and multivariant systems. The catalytic selectivity of the newly designed SAAs is demonstrated in a prototype reaction&#8208;acidic CO2 electroreduction, where all SAAs achieve single&#8208;carbon product selectivity exceeding 70%, with Sb1Cu reaching a peak CO faradaic efficiency of 99.73 &#177; 2.5% at 200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. This work establishes the fundamental design principles for Cu&#8208;based SAAs with excellent dispersion stability and selectivity, and will boost the development of ultrahigh&#8208;performance SAAs for advanced applications such as electrocatalysis.

         <title>CNT&#8208;Supported RuNi Composites Enable High Round&#8208;Trip Efficiency in Regenerative Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
RuNi composites are constructed on surface&#8208;functionalized carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and demonstrated as a multifunctional electrocatalyst for both alkaline hydrogen and oxygen electrolysis. The exceptional catalytic activity and multifunctionality of the catalyst composites across all key reactions enable a regenerative fuel cell system to achieve high round&#8208;trip efficiency at industrial&#8208;level current densities.








Abstract
Regenerative fuel cells hold significant potential for efficient, large&#8208;scale energy storage by reversibly converting electrical energy into hydrogen and vice versa, making them essential for leveraging intermittent renewable energy sources. However, their practical implementation is hindered by the unsatisfactory efficiency. Addressing this challenge requires the development of cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts. In this study, a carbon nanotube (CNT)&#8208;supported RuNi composite with low Ru loading is developed as an efficient and stable catalyst for alkaline hydrogen and oxygen electrocatalysis, including hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution, hydrogen oxidation, and oxygen reduction reaction. Furthermore, a regenerative fuel cell using this catalyst composite is assembled and evaluated under practical relevant conditions. As anticipated, the system exhibits outstanding performance in both the electrolyzer and fuel cell modes. Specifically, it achieves a low cell voltage of 1.64&#160;V to achieve a current density of 1 A cm&#8722;2 for the electrolyzer mode and delivers a high output voltage of 0.52&#160;V at the same current density in fuel cell mode, resulting in a round&#8208;trip efficiency (RTE) of 31.6% without further optimization. The multifunctionality, high activity, and impressive RTE resulted by using the RuNi catalyst composites underscore its potential as a single catalyst for regenerative fuel cells.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Retina by Regulating Ion&#8208;Confined Transport in Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ion&#8208;confined transport strategy is developed to construct a bio&#8208;inspired retina that processes information through synaptic mechanisms, enabling precise modulation of optical signals. By integrating both inhibitory and excitatory artificial synapses, the system effectively processes various vision tasks, including image recognition, dynamic motion analysis, and path planning for robot vehicles.








Abstract
The effective and precise processing of visual information by the human eye primarily relies on the diverse contrasting functions achieved through synaptic regulation of ion transport in the retina. Developing a bio&#8208;inspired retina that uses ions as information carriers can more accurately replicate retina's natural signal processing capabilities, enabling high&#8208;performance machine vision. Herein, an ion&#8208;confined transport strategy is proposed to construct a bio&#8208;inspired retina by developing artificial synapses with inhibitory and excitatory contrasting functions. By fine&#8208;tuning the ionic hydrogel structures to control ion transport across the heterogeneous interfaces, inhibitory and excitatory synapses are realized to negatively or positively modulate the optical signal. The integration of these synapses facilitates advanced tasks such as image recognition and motion analysis. Moreover, as a proof of concept, guiding robot vehicles to perform path planning is demonstrated. This work offers a new idea for constructing the bio&#8208;inspired retina by precisely regulating ion transport, allowing it to reach a level closer to the biological retina.

         <title>Giant Non&#8208;Saturating Exchange Striction in a Noncollinear Antiferromagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;quality single crystals of the noncollinear antiferromagnet Mn3Sn are synthesized, and a non&#8208;saturating magnetostriction exceeding 400&#160;ppm under 57 T is observed, surpassing the giant magnetostriction materials such as FeGa. The theoretical analyses indicate that this pronounced non&#8208;saturating magnetostriction stems from an exotic exchange striction mechanism, which facilitates a linear relationship between strain output and applied magnetic field.








Abstract
Magnetostriction, discovered by Joule in 1842, refers to the mechanical strain that a material undergoes in the presence of a magnetic field. Conventionally, it originates from the spin&#8208;orbit coupling and has been predominantly explored in ferromagnets. In this work, a giant magnetostriction effect is reported in the high&#8208;quality single crystal of a noncollinear antiferromagnet Mn3Sn. Non&#8208;saturating magnetostriction exceeding 400&#160;ppm is obtained, which is even larger than the saturation values of the well&#8208;known Fe&#8208;based giant magnetostriction ferromagnetic materials such as FeGa. Theoretical calculations reveal that the large non&#8208;saturating magnetostriction results from a sophisticated exchange striction effect of the noncollinear antiferromagnetic spin structure, leading to a nearly linear dependence of the strain output on the applied magnetic field. This work provides an unprecedented strategy to design next&#8208;generation magnetoelastic materials with noncollinear compensated spin structures.

         <title>Ultrafast Superradiant Scintillation from Isolated Weakly Confined Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficiency and scintillation velocity are critical for high&#8208;energy and medical physics. These parameters, typically conflicting in conventional scintillators, are simultaneously optimized by exploiting the giant oscillator strength of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals, leading to radiatively accelerated (multi)excitonic emission with unity efficiency without detrimental light transport losses in polymeric nanocomposites. This opens up interesting developments in fast&#8208;timing radiation detection based on colloidal nanocrystals.








Abstract
Efficiency and emission rate are two traditionally conflicting parameters in radiation detection, and achieving their simultaneous maximization can significantly advance ultrafast time&#8208;of&#8208;flight (ToF) technologies. In this study, it is demonstrated that this goal is attainable by harnessing the giant oscillator strength (GOS) inherent to weakly confined perovskite nanocrystals, which enables superradiant scintillation under mildly cryogenic conditions that align seamlessly with ToF technologies. It is shown that the radiative acceleration due to GOS encompasses both single and multiple exciton dynamics arising from ionizing interactions, further enhanced by suppressed non&#8208;radiative losses and Auger recombination at 80 K. The outcome is ultrafast scintillation with 420&#160;ps lifetime and light yield of &#8776;10&#160;000 photons/MeV for diluted NC solutions, all without non&#8208;radiative losses. Temperature&#8208;dependent light&#8208;guiding experiments on test&#8208;bed nanocomposite scintillators finally indicate that the light&#8208;transport capability remains unaffected by the accumulation of band&#8208;edge oscillator strength due to GOS. These findings suggest a promising pathway toward developing ultrafast nanotechnological scintillators with optimized light output and timing performance.

These parameters, typically conflicting in conventional scintillators, are simultaneously optimized by exploiting the giant oscillator strength of CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanocrystals, leading to radiatively accelerated (multi)excitonic emission with unity efficiency without detrimental light transport losses in polymeric nanocomposites. This opens up interesting developments in fast-timing radiation detection based on colloidal nanocrystals.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efficiency and emission rate are two traditionally conflicting parameters in radiation detection, and achieving their simultaneous maximization can significantly advance ultrafast time-of-flight (ToF) technologies. In this study, it is demonstrated that this goal is attainable by harnessing the giant oscillator strength (GOS) inherent to weakly confined perovskite nanocrystals, which enables superradiant scintillation under mildly cryogenic conditions that align seamlessly with ToF technologies. It is shown that the radiative acceleration due to GOS encompasses both single and multiple exciton dynamics arising from ionizing interactions, further enhanced by suppressed non-radiative losses and Auger recombination at 80 K. The outcome is ultrafast scintillation with 420&#160;ps lifetime and light yield of &#8776;10&#160;000 photons/MeV for diluted NC solutions, all without non-radiative losses. Temperature-dependent light-guiding experiments on test-bed nanocomposite scintillators finally indicate that the light-transport capability remains unaffected by the accumulation of band-edge oscillator strength due to GOS. These findings suggest a promising pathway toward developing ultrafast nanotechnological scintillators with optimized light output and timing performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regulating Electron Distribution in Regioisomeric Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Solar&#8208;Driven Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two regioisomeric COFs incorporating the thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene moiety are synthesized for photocatalytic H2O2 production. The &#946;&#8208;isomer exhibits exceptional performance compared to the &#945;&#8208;isomeric counterpart due to optimized electron distribution, enhance charge transfer efficiency, and precise alignment of excited&#8208;state electrons with the ORR active site, demonstrating the great potential of leveraging regioisomerism in COF design.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are emerging as a transformative platform for photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production due to their highly ordered structures, intrinsic porosity, and molecular tunability. Despite their potential, the inefficient utilization of photogenerated charge carriers in COFs significantly restrains their photocatalytic efficiency. This study presents two regioisomeric COFs, &#945;&#8208;TT&#8208;TDAN COF and &#946;&#8208;TT&#8208;TDAN COF, both incorporating thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene moieties, to investigate the influence of regioisomerism on the excited electron distribution and its impact on photocatalytic performance. The &#946;&#8208;TT&#8208;TDAN COF demonstrates a remarkable solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency of 1.35%, outperforming its &#945;&#8208;isomeric counterpart, which is merely 0.44%. Comprehensive spectroscopic and computational investigations reveal the critical role of subtle substitution change in COFs on their electronic properties. This structural adjustment intricately connects molecular structure to charge dynamics, enabling precise regulation of electron distribution, efficient charge separation and transport, and localization of excited electrons at active sites. Moreover, this finely tuned interplay significantly enhances the efficiency of the oxygen reduction reaction. These findings establish a new paradigm in COF design, offering a molecular&#8208;level strategy to advance COFs and reticular materials toward highly efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion.

         <title>In Situ Repair and Reconstruction of Copper Surface Enhanced Its Anti&#8208;Oxidation Properties and Stability for Deep Learning&#8208;Powered Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting Labels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ repair and surface reconstruction of oxidized copper (Cu) (Cu foil, Cu nanowires, Cu nanoparticles) is achieved by solvothermal reaction. The experimental data and Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that (111) crystal&#8208;plane reconstruction enhances the oxidation resistance of the metal, and the method is equally applicable to the Ag nanomaterials (Ag nanowires, Ag nanocubes), which also exhibits good oxidation resistance.








Abstract
The in situ repair of oxidized copper (Cu) surfaces while constructing a superior protective layer is critical for sustainable development and the efficient utilization of metallic materials. Here, a simple solvothermal treatment is presented to repair oxidized Cu surfaces (Cu foils, nanowires, and nanocubes) and reconstruct an antioxidant layer with an ordered (111) crystal&#8208;plane (Cu&#8208;SC) in situ. Electrochemical measurements reveal that the corrosion rate of Cu&#8208;SC in 0.1&#160;m NaOH is reduced to 1.99 &#215; 10&#8722;3&#160;mm yr&#8722;&#185;, a fivefold improvement over pristine Cu (1.00 &#215; 10&#8722;2 mm yr&#8722;&#185;). Density functional theory calculations confirm that the reconstructed (111) surface reduces oxygen molecule adsorption, significantly hinders oxygen atom diffusion into the bulk and continuous adsorption on surface. Anti&#8208;counterfeiting labels fabricated from Cu&#8208;SC nanowires exhibit exceptional durability, retaining reliable authentication accuracy after 144&#160;h at 85&#160;&#176;C/85% relative humidity and 2000 bending cycles. The enhanced anti&#8208;oxidation properties of Cu&#8208;SC ensure the stability of its microstructures, which are critical for deep learning&#8208;based authentication, allowing precise feature extraction and accurate label verification even under extreme conditions. These results highlight the potential of (111) surface reconstruction for enhancing material stability, enabling advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications, and promoting the sustainable utilization of metallic materials.

         <title>Suspension Electrolytes with Catalytically Self&#8208;Expediating Desolvation Kinetics for Low&#8208;Temperature Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The CeO2&#8208;x&#8208;suspension electrolyte is initially proposed to regulate the Zn[(H2O)6]2+ solvation structure and alters the inner Helmholtz plane to accelerate Zn[(H2O)6]2+ desolvation, achieving a homogenized electric field and uniform ion flux kinetics. Consequently, the suspen sion electrolyte achieves a service life exceeding 6500 h at 0&#160;&#176;C and demonstrates outstanding rate performance at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C, highlighting its practical potential for AZMBs.








Abstract
The conventional electrolyte for rechargeable aqueous zinc metal batteries (AZMBs) breeds many problems such as Zn dendrite growth and side reaction of hydrogen evolution reaction, which are fundamentally attributed to the uneven ion flux owing to the high barriers of desolvation and diffusion of Zn[(H2O)6]2+ clusters. Herein, to modulate the [Zn(H2O)6]2+ solvation structure, the suspension electrolyte engineering employed with electron&#8208;delocalized catalytic nanoparticles is initially proposed to expedite desolvation kinetics. As a proof, the electron&#8208;density&#8208;adjustable CeO2&#8208;x is introduced into the commercial electrolyte and preferentially adsorbed on the Zn surface, regulating the Zn[(H2O)6]2+ structure. Meanwhile, the defect&#8208;rich CeO2&#8208;x redistributes the localized space electric field to uniformize ion flux kinetics and inhibits dendrite growth, as confirmed by a series of theoretical simulations, spectroscopical and experimental measurements. Encouragingly, the CeO2&#8208;x decorated suspension electrolyte enables a long stability over 1200 cycles at 5 mA cm&#8722;2 and an extended lifespan exceeding 6500 h with lower overpotentials of 34 mV under 0&#160;&#176;C. Matched with polyaniline cathodes, the full cells with suspension electrolyte exhibit a capacity&#8208;retention of 96.75% at 1 A g&#8722;1 under &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C as well as a long lifespan of up to 400 cycles in a large&#8208;areal pouch cell, showcasing promising potentials of suspension electrolyte for practical AZMBs.

         <title>Synergetic Oxidized Mg and Mo Sites on Amorphous Ru Metallene Boost Hydrogen Evolution Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sluggish water&#8208;splitting step hinders the advancement of alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), making the design of efficient water&#8208;splitting active sites critical. The MgOx and MoOy on the atomically thin Ru metallene can cooperatively promote the adsorption&#8211;dissociation of water molecules, greatly promoting the efficiency of alkaline HER.








Abstract
Ruthenium (Ru) is considered as a promising catalyst for the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), yet its weak water adsorption ability hinders the water splitting efficiency. Herein, a concept of introducing the oxygenophilic MgOx and MoOy species onto amorphous Ru metallene is demonstrated through a simple one&#8208;pot salt&#8208;templating method for the synergic promotion of water adsorption and splitting to greatly enhance the alkaline HER electrocatalysis. The atomically thin MgOx and MoOy species on Ru metallene (MgOx/MoOy&#8208;Ru) show a 15.3&#8208;fold increase in mass activity for HER at the potential of 100&#160;mV than that of Ru metallene and an ultralow overpotential of 8.5&#160;mV at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. It is further demonstrated that the MgOx/MoOy&#8208;Ru&#8208;based anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer can achieve a high current density of 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at a remarkably low cell voltage of 1.55&#160;V, and exhibit excellent durability of over 60&#160;h at a current density of 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. In situ spectroscopy and theoretical simulations reveal that the co&#8208;introduction of MgOx and MoOy enhances interfacial water adsorption and splitting by promoting adsorption on oxidized Mg sites and lowering the dissociation&#160;energy barrier on oxidized Mo sites.

         <title>Controlled Modulation of Intrinsic Electron Response in C/CoxTy Nanoplates Toward Multispectral Excitation Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the C/CoxTy nanoplates with high&#8208;efficiency and tunable electromagnetic properties are successfully prepared by customizing Co&#8208;based nanoparticles. Relying on these C/CoxTy nanoplates, a series of multispectral electromagnetic functional devices are developed, opening up a new era of multispectral electromagnetic devices.








Abstract
Electromagnetic materials with adjustable dielectric and magnetic properties are constantly sought after in electronic and industrial fields. In this study, an innovative strategy that customizes anchored Co&#8208;based nanoparticles to optimize the electronic behaviors is proposed for the first time, enabling a controllable and high&#8208;efficiency evolution of the macroscopic electromagnetic response of Co&#8208;based (C/CoxTy) nanoplates across the X&#8208;ray, light in the solar band and gigahertz band. Specifically, in the gigahertz band, the C/Co and C/Co3Se4 nanoplates with high&#8208;power loss capabilities can effectively attenuate and convert electromagnetic energy into heat energy, which not only prevents space electromagnetic radiation but also powers energy for various electromagnetic devices such as thermoelectric generators and microwave actuators. Moreover, multiband antennas and ultra&#8208;wideband bandstop filters are successfully achieved and flexibly tuned. Meanwhile, C/CoxTy nanoplates photo&#8208; and X&#8208;ray detectors are constructed successfully. Additionally, the C/CoTe nanoplate X&#8208;ray detector, featuring remarkable stability, sensitivity and penetrability, is successfully utilized to construct the interaction system integrating communication and imaging. In summary, this work offers an effective way for flexible regulation of multispectral electromagnetic response, significantly advancing the development of multispectral electromagnetic functional devices.

         <title>Non&#8208;Invasive Diagnosis of Early Colorectal Cancerization via Amplified Sensing of MicroRNA&#8208;21 in NIR&#8208;II Window</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>

An amplified sensing strategy is reported in the second near&#8208;infrared long&#8208;wavelength (NIR&#8208;II&#8208;L, 1500&#8211;1900 nm) window for non&#8208;invasivel in situ visualization of early cancerization biomarker miRNA&#8208;21, providing a promising alternative for early diagnosis of cancerization and a guidance for therapeutic management.








Abstract
Accurate, sensitive, and in situ visualization of aberrant expression level of low&#8208;abundant biomolecules is crucial for early colorectal cancer (CRC) detection ahead of tumor morphology change. However, the clinical used colonoscopy and biopsy methods are invasive and lack of sensitivity at early&#8208;stage of cancerization. Here, an amplified sensing strategy is developed in the second near&#8208;infrared long&#8208;wavelength subregion (NIR&#8208;II&#8208;L, 1500&#8211;1900&#160;nm) by integrating DNAzyme&#8208;triggered signal amplification technology and lanthanide&#8208;dye hybrid system. In the early&#8208;stage of CRC, the overexpressed biomarker microRNA&#8208;21 initiates the NIR&#8208;II&#8208;L luminescence ratiometric signal amplification of the CRCsensor. The high sensitivity with a limit of detection (LOD) of 1.26 pm allows non&#8208;invasive visualization of orthotopic colorectal cancerization via rectal administration, which achieves early and accurate in situ diagnosis at 2 weeks ahead of the in vitro histological results. This innovative approach offers a promising tool for early diagnosis and long&#8208;term monitoring of carcinogenesis progression, with potential applications in other cancer&#8208;related biomarkers.

         <title>Residual Al Adatoms Driven Epitaxy of AlGaN QWs for High&#8208;Performance UV LEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative strategy is proposed for the atomic&#8208;level controllable growth of composition&#8208;engineered AlGaN quantum wells (QWs) with residual Al adatom&#8208;assisted incorporation&#8208;enhanced epitaxy (RAIE) strategy, enabling the achievement of high&#8208;efficiency and long&#8208;lifetime ultraviolet light&#8208;emitting diodes (UV LEDs) with tunable wavelengths spanning the efficiency gap region from 276 to 329&#160;nm in the UV band.








Abstract
AlGaN&#8208;based ultraviolet (UV) light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) experience a notable reduction in efficiency within the 280&#8211;330&#160;nm wavelength range, known as the &#8220;UVB gap&#8221;. Given the extensive applications of UV LEDs in this wavelength range, it is imperative to bridge this efficiency gap. In this study, a strategy facilitated by the presence of residual Al adatoms is introduced to simultaneously improve the integration of Ga&#8208;adatoms and the migration of Al/Ga&#8208;adatoms during the growth of low&#8208;Al&#8208;composition AlGaN quantum wells (QWs) even at high temperatures comparable to those used for high&#8208;Al&#8208;composition AlGaN quantum barriers. This growth strategy enables the epitaxy of high&#8208;quality AlGaN QWs with a wide tunable emission wavelength range across the UVB gap. Utilizing this approach, high&#8208;efficiency UV LEDs that effectively bridge the UVB gap are developed. Furthermore, benefiting from this QWs growth configuration, these UV LEDs exhibit an exceptionally long L70 lifetime, marking a significant step forward in the growth technology of AlGaN QWs and expanding the application possibilities of UV LEDs.

         <dc:description>
Strategically engineered Ru0.8Ir0.2Ox ultrathin nanosheets with high&#8208;density grain boundaries exhibit enhanced oxygen evolution reaction performance in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers. This design optimizes Ru&#8208;Ir interactions and charge distribution, reducing overpotential to 189 mV for 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and maintaining stability for &gt;1000 h at industrial&#8208;scale current density. This advancement offers a pathway to efficient, cost&#8208;effective green hydrogen production.








Abstract
The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWE) has long stood as a formidable challenge for green hydrogen sustainable production, hindered by sluggish kinetics, high overpotentials, and poor durability. Here, these barriers are transcended through a novel material design: strategic engineering of high&#8208;density grain boundaries within solid&#8208;solution Ru0.8Ir0.2Ox ultrathin nanosheets. These carefully tailored grain boundaries and synergistic Ir&#9472;Ru interactions, reduce the coordination of Ru atoms and optimize the distribution of charge, thereby enhancing both the catalytic activity and stability of the nanosheets, as verified by merely requiring an overpotential of 189 mV to achieve 10 mA cm&#8722;2 in acidic electrolyte. In situ electrochemical techniques, complemented by theoretical calculations, reveal that the OER follows an adsorption evolution mechanism, demonstrating the pivotal role of grain boundary engineering and electronic modulation in accelerating reaction kinetics. Most notably, the Ru0.8Ir0.2Ox exhibits outstanding industrial&#8208;scale performance in PEMWE, reaching 4.0 A cm&#8722;2 at 2 V and maintaining stability for &gt;1000 h at 500 mA cm&#8722;2. This efficiency reduces hydrogen production costs to $0.88 kg&#8722;1. This work marks a transformative step forward in designing efficient, durable OER catalysts, offering a promising pathway toward hydrogen production technologies and advancing the global transition to sustainable energy.

         <title>An n&#8208;Doped Organic Cross&#8208;Linked Electron Transport Layer with High Electrical Conductivity for High&#8208;Efficiency Tandem Organic Photovoltaics</title>

An n&#8208;doped ETL, that is c&#8208;NDI&#8208;Br:PEI with high electrical conductivity, strong work function modification ability and good solvent resistance, is developed via a simple in situ cross&#8208;linking reaction. The tandem OPVs, with the all&#8208;solution&#8208;processed organic/organic ICL (m&#8208;PEDOT:PSS/c&#8208;NDI&#8208;Br:PEI) achieve 20.06% efficiency under solar radiation, and 38.50% efficiency under 808 nm laser. This study provides a new method to design high&#8208;perfoimance ICLs.








Abstract
With merits of good solution processability, intrinsic flexibility, etc, organic/organic interconnecting layers (ICLs) are highly desirable for tandem organic photovoltaics (OPVs). Herein, an n&#8208;doped cross&#8208;linked organic electron transport layer (ETL), named c&#8208;NDI&#8208;Br:PEI is developed, via a simple in situ quaternization reaction between bromopentyl&#8208;substituted naphthalene diimide derivative (NDI&#8208;Br) and polyethylenimine (PEI). Due to strong self&#8208;doping, c&#8208;NDI&#8208;Br:PEI films exhibit a high electrical conductivity (0.06 S&#160;cm&#8722;1), which is important for efficient hole and electron reombination in ICL of tandem OPVs. In addition, the cross&#8208;linked ETLs show strong work function modulation ability, and good solvent&#8208;resistance. The above features enable c&#8208;NDI&#8208;Br:PEI to function as an efficient ETL not only for single&#8208;junction OPVs, but also for tandem devices without any metal layer in ICL. Under solar radiation, the single&#8208;junction device with c&#8208;NDI&#8208;Br:PEI as ETL achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.18%, surpassing the ZnO&#8208;based device (17.09%). The homo&#8208; and hetero&#8208;tandem devices with m&#8208;PEDOT:PSS:c&#8208;NDI&#8208;Br:PEI as ICL exhibit remarkable PCEs of 19.06% and 20.06%, respectively. Under 808&#160;nm laser radiation with a photon flux of 57&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, the homo&#8208;tandem device presents a superior PCE of 38.5%. This study provides a new ETL for constructing all&#8208;solution&#8208;processed organic/organic ICL, which can be integrated in flexible and wearable devices.

         <title>An Air&#8208;Operated, High&#8208;Performance Fe&#8208;Ion Secondary Battery Using Acidic Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The air&#8208;operated assembly of aqueous Fe&#8208;ion batteries is realized by a very unexpected finding when excess acid is introduced into the traditional aqueous FeSO4 electrolyte. A proton/O2 competitive mechanism for the as&#8208;detected ultra&#8208;low dissolved O2 and reduced coordinated O2 in the Fe2+ solvated shell is revealed.








Abstract
Fe2+ have emerged as the ideal charge carriers to construct aqueous batteries as one of the most competitive candidates for next&#8208;generation low&#8208;cost and safe energy storage. Unfortunately, the fast oxidation of Fe2+ into Fe3+ at ambient conditions inevitably requires the assembly process of the cells in an oxygen&#8208;free glovebox. Up to date, direct air assembly of aqueous Fe&#8208;ion battery remains very desirable yet highly challenge. Here oxidation of Fe2+ is found at ambient condition and is completely inhibited in an acidic electrolyte. A proton/O2 competitive mechanism in the acidic electrolyte is revealed with reduced coordinated O2 in the Fe2+ solvated shell for this unexpected finding. Based on this surprise, for the first time, air&#8208;operated assembly of iron&#8208;ion batteries is realized. Meanwhile, it is found that the acidic environment induces the in situ growth of active &#945;&#8208;FeOOH derivate on the VOPO4&#183;2H2O surface. Strikingly, the acidic electrolyte enables an air&#8208;operated Fe&#8208;ion battery with a high specific capacity of 192 mAh g&#8722;1 and ultrastable cycling stability over 1300 cycles at 0.1 A g&#8722;1. This work makes a break through on the air&#8208;assembly of Fe&#8208;ion battery without oxygen&#8208;free glovebox. It also reveals previously unknown proton/O2 competitive mechanisms in the Fe2+ solvated shell and cathode surface chemistry for aqueous Fe2+ storage.

         <title>Grains &gt; 2&#160;&#181;m with Regulating Grain Boundaries for Efficient Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite and All&#8208;Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
A simple and effective approach to grain boundary growth optimization: Incorporating a KTFB polyfluorinated additive into the antisolvent to regulate grain boundary growth, eliminate excessive halide lead and defects, and form wide&#8208;bandgap (1.78&#160;eV) perovskite films with grain size over 2&#160;&#181;m, enabling the realization of efficient two&#8208;terminal and four&#8208;terminal all&#8208;perovskite tandem devices.









Abstract
Tandem perovskite solar cells represent a significant avenue for the future development of perovskite photovoltaics. Despite their promise, wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites, essential for constructing efficient tandem structures, have encountered formidable challenges. Notably, the high bromine content (&gt;40%) in these 1.78 eV bandgap perovskites triggers rapid crystallization, complicating the control of grain boundary growth and leading to films with smaller grain sizes and higher defect density than those with narrower bandgaps. To address this, potassium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate molecules are incorporated into the antisolvent, employing a crystallographic orientation&#8208;tailored strategy to optimize grain boundary growth, thereby achieving wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite films with grains exceeding 2&#160;&#181;m and effectively eliminating surplus lead halide and defects at the grain boundaries. As a result, remarkable efficiency is achieved in single&#8208;junction wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite devices, with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.7%, and in all&#8208;perovskite tandem devices, with a two&#8208;terminal PCE of 28.3% and a four&#8208;terminal PCE of 29.1%, which all rank among the highest reported values in the literature. Moreover, the stability of these devices has been markedly improved. These findings offer a novel perspective for driving further advancements in the perovskite solar cell domain.

         <title>Tailoring Self&#8208;Catalytic N&#9472;Co Bonds into Heterostructure Architectures: Deciphering Polytellurides Conversion Mechanism Toward Ultralong&#8208;Lifespan Potassium Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;doped CoTe2 composites, incorporating 3D low&#8208;tortuosity tunneling structure, self&#8208;catalytic N&#9472;Co bonds, and heterojunction, have been successfully fabricated to accelerate the catalytic conversion of potassium polytellurides. Benefiting from the synergistic effects of unique architecture and superior conversion kinetics, the composites deliver an ultralong&#8208;lifespan potassium storage performance over 25&#160;000 cycles with an ultra&#8208;low capacity decay rate of only 0.0019%.








Abstract
Transition metal tellurides (TMTes) are promising anodes for potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) due to their high theoretical specific capacity and impressive electronic conductivity. Nevertheless, TMTes suffer from persistent capacity degradation due to the large volume expansion, high ion&#8208;diffusion energy barriers, and the dissolution/shuttle of potassium polytellurides (KxTey). Herein, a heterostructured CoTe2 composite equipped with a self&#8208;catalytic center (N&#8208;CoTe2/LTTC) is developed, exploiting its low&#8208;tortuosity tunneling, chemical tunability, and self&#8208;catalytic properties to elevate cycling stability to new heights. Systematic experiments have verified that the elaborate N&#8208;CoTe2/LTTC provides a short&#8208;range and efficient electron/ion transport path, accelerates K+ diffusion kinetics, and suppresses huge volume distortion. Notably, the N&#9472;Co bonds self&#8208;catalytic center can promote the adsorption capabilities and accelerate the conversion kinetics for KxTey under the synergistic effect of heterojunction. Consequently, the optimized N&#8208;CoTe2/LTTC electrode delivers an ultralong&#8209;lifespan cyclability (over 25 000 cycles at 2.0 A g&#8722;1, only 0.0019% capacity decay rate per cycle), outperforming those of reported Te&#8208;based anodes. Finally, the N&#8208;CoTe2/LTTC//PTCDA@450 full cell manifests impressive stability (over 4300 cycles at 2.0 A g&#8722;1). This work uncovers the impact of catalytic centers on the conversion of KxTey and provides valuable insights for rationally designing ultralong&#8208;lifespan TMTes anodes for PIBs.

This work proposed an efficient Yb3+&#8208;doped PEA2Cs2Pb3Br10 quasi 2D layered metal halide perovskites (2D&#8208;LMHPs)&#160;film and revealed the microscopic energy transfer process of the complex system. Moreover, an efficient and super&#8208;stable 990 nm NIR PeLED with the external quantum efficiency (EQE)&#160;up to 8.8% and a record operational lifetime of 1274 min is obtained. These findings will expand the optical properties and application potential of quasi 2D&#8208;LMHPs materials.








Abstract
Quasi 2D layered metal halide perovskites (2D&#8208;LMHPs) with natural quantum wells (QWs) structure have garnered significant attention due to their excellent optoelectronic properties. Doping rare earth (RE) ions with 4fn inner shell emission levels can largely expand their optical and optoelectronic properties and realize diverse applications, but has not been reported yet. Herein, an efficient Yb3+&#8208;doped PEA2Cs2Pb3Br10 quasi 2D&#8208;LMHPs is fabricated and directly identified the Yb3+ ions in the quasi 2D&#8208;LMHPs at the atomic scale using aberration electron microscopy. The interaction between different n phases and Yb3+ ions is elucidated using ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy and luminescent dynamics, which demonstrated efficient, different time scales and multi&#8208;channel energy transfer processes. Finally, through phase distribution manipulation and surface passivation, the optimized film exhibits a photoluminescence quantum yield of 144%. This is the first demonstration of quantum cutting emission in pure Br&#8208;based perovskite material, suppressing defect states and ion migration. The efficient and stable near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;emitting diodes (NIR LED) is fabricated with a peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 8.8% at 990&#160;nm and the record lifetime of 1274&#160;min. This work provides fresh insight into the interaction between RE ions and quasi 2D&#8208;LMHPs and extend the function and application of quasi 2D&#8208;LMHPs materials.

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Assisted Ni 3d&#8211;S 3p Hybridization within Targeted In&#8211;S Layer for Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic layer modulation is instrumental in optimizing catalytic kinetics for obtaining highly active photocatalysts. A precise atomic layer regulation strategy is proposed to realize the individual modulation of the surface In&#8211;S layer in ZnIn2S4, which creates deeper hybridized electronic states of Ni 3d&#8211;S 3p to optimize H* adsorption/desorption and maximize surface catalytic benefits for the hydrogen evolution reaction.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven hydrogen production is significant for achieving carbon neutrality but is limited by unsatisfactory surface catalytic reaction kinetics. Layer regulation can impact carrier transmission or catalytic behavior, but the specific effects on the oxygen or hydrogen evolution reaction (OER or HER) remain unclear, and atomic layer level modulation for maxing HER is challenging. Here the distinct roles of modulated Zn&#8211;S or In&#8211;S surface layers in ZnIn2S4 (ZIS) for the OER and HER, respectively, are disentangled. Moreover, the extensive characterizations and computational results demonstrate that stressful environments enable individual modulation and introduce Ni into the surface In&#8211;S layer rather than the easily alterable Zn&#8211;S layer, creating deeper hybridized electronic states of Ni 3d&#8211;S 3p, optimizing H* adsorption/desorption, and maximizing surface catalytic benefits for the HER. Consequently, the optimized ZIS exhibited a photocatalytic hydrogen production rate of up to 18.19&#160;mmol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1, &#8776;32 times higher than pristine ZIS. This investigation expands the application scenarios of ultrasonic technology and inspires other precise control types, such as defects and crystal plane engineering, etc.

         <title>Lithium Bond&#8208;Mediated Molecular Cascade Hydrogel for Injury&#8208;Free and Repositionable Adhesive Bioelectronic Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible bioelectronic interfaces with adhesive properties are essential for advancing modern medicine and human&#8208;machine interactions.

Abstract
Flexible bioelectronic interfaces with adhesive properties are essential for advancing modern medicine and human&#8208;machine interactions. However, achieving both stable adhesion and non&#8208;damaging detachment remains a significant challenge. In this study, a lithium bond&#8208;mediated molecular cascade hydrogel (LMCH) for bioelectronic interfaces is designed, which facilitates robust adhesion at the tissue level and permits atraumatic detachment for repositioning as required. By integrating the adhesive properties of the molecular cascade structure with the elastic characteristics of the hydrogel interface, the LMCH interface not only achieved a high adhesion strength (197&#160;J&#160;m&#8722;2) on the skin, but also significantly extended the cracking cycles on the tissue surface during the peeling process from 4 to 380, marking an enhancement of nearly two orders of magnitude. Furthermore, with Young's modulus similar to that of human tissue (25&#160;kPa), exceptional stretchability (1080%), and high ionic conductivity (7.14&#160;S&#160;m&#8722;1), the LMCH interface demonstrates outstanding tissue compatibility, biocompatibility, and stable detection capabilities for electrocardiogram (ECG) and electromyogram (EMG) signals. This study presents new insights and potential for advancing bioelectronics and implantable interface technologies.

By integrating the adhesive properties of the molecular cascade structure with the elastic characteristics of the hydrogel interface, the LMCH interface not only achieved a high adhesion strength (197&#160;J&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) on the skin, but also significantly extended the cracking cycles on the tissue surface during the peeling process from 4 to 380, marking an enhancement of nearly two orders of magnitude. Furthermore, with Young's modulus similar to that of human tissue (25&#160;kPa), exceptional stretchability (1080%), and high ionic conductivity (7.14&#160;S&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), the LMCH interface demonstrates outstanding tissue compatibility, biocompatibility, and stable detection capabilities for electrocardiogram (ECG) and electromyogram (EMG) signals. This study presents new insights and potential for advancing bioelectronics and implantable interface technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Peptide&#8208;Oligonucleotide Nanohybrids Designed for Precise Gene Therapy of Rheumatoid Arthritis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The peptide&#8208;oligonucleotide (PON) nanohybrids can be readily fabricated by the bioorthogonal click reaction between PEG5&#8208;P7&#8208;R9&#8208;(G&#8208;DOPA)4&#8208;HPGGPQ&#8208;H8&#8208;C&#8208;DBCO and miRNA&#8208;124&#8208;A5&#8208;(CH2)6&#8208;Azido, which achieve targeted delivery to the lesion sites, robust penetration through cell membrane, efficient scavenging of intracellular ROS, as well as timely escape from the endolysosomes of macrophages, inhibiting proinflammatory M1 polarization and osteoclast differentiation, eventually attenuating arthritic bone destruction and systemic osteoporosis.









Abstract
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by excessive inflammation, pathological bone resorption, and systemic osteoporosis. It lacks effective treatment due to the complex pathogenesis. Gene therapy, especially targeted oligonucleotide (ON) delivery therapy, offers a new prospect for the precise treatment of RA. Nevertheless, the clinical application of ON delivery therapy still faces various challenges such as the rapid enzymolysis by RNAse, the lack of tissue targeting ability, difficulty in cell membrane penetration, and the incapability of endolysosomal escape. To address these issues, a novel kind of engineered peptide and oligonucleotide (PON) nanohybrids are designed and fabricated, which provide various advantages including good biosafety, inflammatory region&#8208;targeted delivery, cell membrane penetration, reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging, and endolysosomal escape. The PON nanohybrids produce promising effects in suppressing inflammatory responses and osteoclastogenesis of macrophages via multiple signaling pathways. In vivo administration of PON nanohybrids not only ameliorates local joint bone destruction and systemic osteoporosis in the pathological state, but also demonstrates good prophylactic effects against the rapid progression of RA disease. In conclusion, the study presents a promising strategy for precise RA treatment and broadens the biomedical applications of gene therapy based on delivery system.

         <title>Resolving Dynamic Behavior of Electrocatalysts via Advances of Operando X&#8208;Ray Absorption Spectroscopies: Potential Artifacts and Practical Guidelines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Resolving dynamically fine structure of electrocatalysts is realized by advanced X&#8208;ray spectroscopies. Based on a case study of operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy at various beamlines, potential artifacts generated by X&#8208;ray irradiation are validated and it is identified whether the dynamic behaviors are electrochemical reaction related. A practical protocol is proposed for conducting reliable&#160;X&#8208;ray spectroscopic measurements for accurate spectra interpretation.








Abstract
Although numerous techniques are developed to enable real&#8208;time understanding of dynamic interactions at the solid&#8211;liquid interface during electrochemical reactions, further progress in the development of these methods over the last several decades has faced challenges. With the rapid development of high&#8208;brilliance synchrotron sources, operando X&#8208;ray spectroscopies have become increasingly popular for revealing interfacial features and catalytic mechanisms in electrocatalysis. Nevertheless, the resulting spectra are highly sensitive to factors such as X&#8208;ray radiation, reaction environment, and acquisition procedures, all of which may potentially introduce artifacts that are often overlooked, leading to misinterpretations of electrocatalytic behaviors. In this perspective, several emerging hard X&#8208;ray spectroscopies used in electrocatalysis research are reviewed, highlighting their electronic transition processes, detection modes, and functional complementarity. Significantly, based on a case study of operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy at various beamlines, potential artifacts generated by X&#8208;ray irradiation are systematically investigated through photon&#8208;flux density&#8208;, dose&#8208;, and time&#8208;dependent studies of typical copper electrocatalysts. Accordingly, a practical protocol for conducting reliable X&#8208;ray spectroscopic measurements in operando electrocatalytic studies to minimize potential artifacts that can affect the resulting X&#8208;ray spectra, thereby ensuring accurate interpretation and a deeper understanding of interfacial interactions and electrocatalytic mechanisms, is established.
