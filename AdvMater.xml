         <title>Towards Perfect Optical Diffusers: Dielectric Huygens' Metasurfaces with Critical Positional Disorder</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Conventional optical diffusers, such as thick volume scatterers (Rayleigh scattering) or microstructured surface scatterers (geometric scattering), lack the potential for on&#8208;chip integration and are thus incompatible with next&#8208;generation photonic devices. Dielectric Huygens' metasurfaces, on the other hand, consist of two&#8208;dimensional arrangements of resonant dielectric nanoparticles and therefore constitute a promising material platform for ultra&#8208;thin and highly efficient photonic devices. When the nanoparticles are arranged in a random but statistically specific fashion, diffusers with exceptional properties are expected to come within reach. In this contribution, we&#160;explore how dielectric Huygens' metasurfaces can be used to implement wavelength&#8208;selective diffusers with negligible absorption losses and nearly&#8208;Lambertian scattering profiles that are largely independent of the angle and polarization of incident waves. We&#160;show that the combination of tailored positional disorder with a carefully&#8208;balanced electric and magnetic response of the nanoparticles is an integral requirement for the operation as a diffuser. We&#160;experimentally and numerically characterize the directional scattering performance of the proposed metasurfaces and highlight their usability in wavefront&#8208;shaping applications. Since our&#160;metasurfaces operate on the principles of Mie scattering and are embedded in a glassy environment, they may easily be incorporated in integrated photonic devices, fiber optics, or mechanically robust augmented reality&#160;displays.

         <title>Oxygen Vacancy Injection as a Pathway to Enhancing Electromechanical Response in Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Since their discovery in late 1940s, perovskite ferroelectric materials have become one of the central objects of condensed matter physics and materials science due to the broad spectrum of functional behaviors they exhibit, including electro&#8208;optical phenomena and strong electromechanical coupling. In such disordered materials, the static properties of defects such as oxygen vacancies is well explored, but the dynamic effects are less understood. In this work, we report the first observation of enhanced electromechanical response in BaTiO3 thin films driven via dynamic local oxygen vacancy control in piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM). We explicitly demonstrate a persistence in peizoelectricity past the bulk Curie temperature, and an enhanced electromechanical response due to a created internal electric field that further enhances the intrinsic electrostriction. Our findings are supported by a series of temperature dependent band excitation PFM in ultra&#8208;high vacuum and a combination of modeling techniques including finite element modeling, Reactive Force Field (ReaxFF), and Density Functional Theory (DFT). This study shows the pivotal role that dynamics of vacancies in complex oxides can play in determining functional properties, and thus provides a new route towards achieving enhanced ferroic response with higher functional temperature windows in ferroelectrics and other ferroic materials.

         <title>Smart Chemical Engineering&#8208;based Lightweight and Miniaturized Attachable Systems for Advanced Drug Delivery and Diagnostics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Smart attachable systems have attracted much attention owing to their capabilities in terms of body performance evaluation, disease diagnostics, and drug delivery. Recent advances in chemical and engineering techniques provide many opportunities to improve device fabrication and applications owing to the advantages of being lightweight and easy to control as well as their battery absence and functional diversity. This review highlights the latest developments in the field of chemical engineering&#8208;based lightweight and miniaturized attachable systems, which are mainly inspired by the natural world. Their applications for real&#8208;time monitoring, point&#8208;of&#8208;care sampling, biomarker detection, and controlled release are discussed thoroughly with respect to specific products/prototypes. The perspectives of the field, including persistence guarantee, burden reduction, and personality improvement, are also discussed. It is believed that chemical engineering&#8208;based lightweight and miniaturized attachable systems have good potential in both clinical and industrial fields, indicating a large potential to improve human lives in the near future.

         <title>Surface Chemistry Engineering of Perovskite Quantum Dots: Strategies, Applications, and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The presence of surface ligands not only plays a key role in keeping colloidal integrity and non&#8208;defective surface of metal halide perovskite quantum dots (PQDs), but also serve as a knob to tune their optoelectronic properties for a variety of exciting applications including solar cells and light&#8208;emitting diodes. However, these indispensable surface ligands may also deteriorate the stability and key properties of PQDs due to their highly dynamic binding and insulating nature. To address these issues, a number of innovative surface engineering approaches have been developed in the past few years. Based on an in&#8208;depth fundamental understanding in the surface atomistic structure and surface defect formation in the tiny nanoparticles, this review presents a critical overview focusing on surface chemistry engineering of PQDs including advanced colloidal synthesis, in&#8208;situ surface passivation, and solution&#8208;phase/solid&#8208;state ligand exchange, before highlighting their unprecedented achievements in photovoltaics and other optoelectronics. The practical hurdles and future directions are cirtically discussed to inspire more rational surface design towards efficient and reliable next generation PQD technologies.

         <title>Large Tunneling Magnetoresistance in van der Waals Ferromagnet/Semiconductor Heterojunctions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A large tunneling magnetoresistance is observed in all van der Waals spin valves based on a Fe3GeTe2/InSe/Fe3GeTe2 (ferromagnet/semiconductor/ferromagnet) heterojunction. Devices with the same thickness of the InSe layer reveal either a tunneling or a metallic transport behavior due to pinholes. This finding suggests opportunities for further development of this spin valve as a platform for nonvolatile memories and spin&#8208;logic applications.








Abstract
2D layered chalcogenide semiconductors have been proposed as a promising class of materials for low&#8208;dimensional electronic, optoelectronic, and spintronic devices. Here, all&#8208;2D van der Waals vertical spin&#8208;valve devices, that combine the 2D layered semiconductor InSe as a spacer with the 2D layered ferromagnetic metal Fe3GeTe2 as spin injection and detection electrodes, are reported. Two distinct transport behaviors are observed: tunneling and metallic, which are assigned to the formation of a pinhole&#8208;free tunnel barrier at the Fe3GeTe2/InSe interface and pinholes in the InSe spacer layer, respectively. For the tunneling device, a large magnetoresistance (MR) of 41% is obtained under an applied bias current of 0.1 &#181;A at 10 K, which is about three times larger than that of the metallic device. Moreover, the tunneling device exhibits a lower operating bias current but a more sensitive bias current dependence than the metallic device. The MR and spin polarization of both the metallic and tunneling devices decrease with increasing temperature, which can be fitted well by Bloch's law. These findings reveal the critical role of pinholes in the MR of all&#8208;2D van der Waals ferromagnet/semiconductor heterojunction devices.

         <title>A Regioselectively Oxidized 2D Bi/BiOx Lateral Nano&#8208;Heterostructure for Hypoxic Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bismuthene/bismuth oxide (Bi/BiOx)&#8208;based lateral nano&#8208;heterostructure is fabricated to effectively generate 1O2 under normoxia but produce cytotoxic &#8226;OH and H2 under hypoxia, which synergistically enhances photodynamic therapy. Furthermore, this Bi/BiOx nano&#8208;heterostructure is biocompatible and biodegradable, and, with surface molecular engineering, it improves tumor tissue penetration and increases cellular uptake, yielding excellent oxygen&#8208;independent tumor ablation.








Abstract
Optoelectronic science and 2D nanomaterial technologies are currently at the forefront of multidisciplinary research and have numerous applications in electronics and photonics. The unique energy and optically induced interfacial electron transfer in these nanomaterials, enabled by their relative band alignment characteristics, can provide important therapeutic modalities for healthcare. Given that nano&#8208;heterostructures can facilitate photoinduced electron&#8211;hole separation and enhance generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), 2D nano&#8208;heterostructure&#8208;based photosensitizers can provide a major advancement in photodynamic therapy (PDT), to overcome the current limitations in hypoxic tumor microenvironments. Herein, a bismuthene/bismuth oxide (Bi/BiOx)&#8208;based lateral nano&#8208;heterostructure synthesized using a regioselective oxidation process is introduced, which, upon irradiation at 660&#160;nm, effectively generates 1O2 under normoxia but produces cytotoxic &#8226;OH and H2 under hypoxia, which synergistically enhances PDT. Furthermore, this Bi/BiOx nano&#8208;heterostructure is biocompatible and biodegradable, and, with the surface molecular engineering used here, it improves tumor tissue penetration and increases cellular uptake during in vitro and in vivo experiments, yielding excellent oxygen&#8208;independent tumor ablation with 660&#160;nm irradiation, when compared with traditional PDT agents.

         <title>Piezo&#8208;Photocatalysis over Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks: Promoting Photocatalytic Activity by Piezoelectric Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, two isostructural metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with distinctly different piezoelectric responses are used in piezo&#8208;photocatalysis for the first time. Remarkably, the H2 production efficiency of Hf&#8208;MOF is 2.2 times that of Zr&#8208;MOF under simultaneous light and ultrasonic irradiation. The role of piezoelectric effect can be distinguished owing to their similar pore features and mass transfer behaviors.








Abstract
The built&#8208;in electric field can be generated in the piezoelectric materials under mechanical stress. The resulting piezoelectric effect is beneficial to charge separation in photocatalysis. Meanwhile, the mechanical stress usually gives rise to accelerated mass transfer and enhanced catalytic activity. Unfortunately, it remains a challenge to differentiate the contribution of these two factors to catalytic performance. Herein, for the first time, isostructural metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), i.e., UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2(Zr) and UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2(Hf), are adopted for piezo&#8208;photocatalysis. Both MOFs, featuring the same structures except for diverse Zr/Hf&#8208;oxo clusters, possess distinctly different piezoelectric properties. Strikingly, UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2(Hf) exhibits &#8776;2.2 times of activity compared with that of UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2(Zr) under simultaneous light and ultrasonic irradiation, though both MOFs display similar activity in the photocatalytic H2 production without ultrasonic irradiation. Given their similar pore features and mass transfer behaviors, the activity difference is unambiguously assignable to the piezoelectric effect. As a result, the contributions of the piezoelectric effect to the piezo&#8208;photocatalysis can be clearly distinguished owing to the stronger piezoelectric property of UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2(Hf).

         <title>Elimination of Interfacial&#8208;electrochemical&#8208;reaction&#8208;induced Polarization in Perovskite Single Crystals for Ultra&#8208;sensitive and Stable X&#8208;ray Detector Arrays</title>

Abstract
Organic&#8208;inorganic halide perovskites have exhibited bright prospects in high sensitivity X&#8208;ray detection. However, they generally suffer from the severe field&#8208;driven polarization issue that remarkably deteriorates the detection performance. Here, we demonstrate that the interfacial electrochemical reaction between Au electrodes and halogen in MAPbI3 single crystals (SCs) is the major source of the dark current polarization in the metal&#8208;semiconductor&#8208;metal (MSM) structured perovskite X&#8208;ray detectors at the initial stage of biasing. By introducing the p&#8208; and n&#8208;type charge transport layers to isolate the electrodes from contacting the SC surface, we are able to fully eliminate the polarization under a large electric field up to 1000&#160;V cm&#8211;1. Moreover, the resultant lateral p&#8208;i&#8208;n heterojunction suppresses the dark current of the devices by nearly three orders of magnitude as compared to the MSM counterparts and therefore enables a high sensitivity of 5.2&#215;106 &#956;C Gy&#8211;1air cm&#8211;2 and a record low X&#8208;ray detection limit down to 0.1 nGyair s&#8211;1. The excellent biasing stability and sensitivity of the devices allow us to prepare the linear detector arrays for X&#8208;ray imaging applications.

Abstract
Materials science and chemistry have played a central and significant role in advancing our society. With the shift toward sustainable living, it is anticipated that the development of functional materials will continue to be vital for sustaining life on our planet. In the recent decades, rapid progress has been made in materials science and chemistry owing to the advances in experimental, analytical, and computational methods, thereby producing several novel and useful materials. However, most problems in material development are highly complex. In this review article, we discuss the best strategy for the development of functional materials via the implementation of three key concepts: nanotechnology as a game changer, nanoarchitectonics as an integrator, and materials informatics as a super accelerator. Discussions from conceptual viewpoints and exemplified recent developments, chiefly focused on nanoporous materials, are presented. We anticipate that coupling these three strategies together will open advanced routes for the swift designing and exploratory search of functional materials truly useful for solving real&#8208;world problems. These novel strategies will result in the evolution of nanoporous functional materials.

         <title>An Engineered Pseudo&#8208;Macrophage for Rapid Treatment of Bacteria&#8208;Infected Osteomyelitis via Microwave&#8208;Excited Anti&#8208;Infection and Immunoregulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 41, October 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineered pseudo&#8208;macrophage M&#8208;Fe3O4/Au therapeutic nanoparticles (NPs) that can be locally accumulated at infection sites through double targeting of proteins and magnets and that can mitigate the inflammatory response by immunoregulation through an electromagnetic field produced by microwave (MW) irradiation and neutralizing inflammatory cytokine, are developed; the Fe3O4/Au NPs can generate O2&#8722; and heat by MW assistance.








Abstract
Preventing deep bacterial infection and simultaneously enhancing osteogenic differentiation are in great demand for osteomyelitis. Microwave (MW) dynamic therapy is attracting attention due to its excellent penetration ability, but the mechanism of MW&#8208;induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) is still unknown. Herein, MW&#8208;responsive engineered pseudo&#8208;macrophages (M&#8208;Fe3O4/Au nanoparticles (NPs)) are fabricated to clear Staphylococcus aureus infections and induce M2 polarization of macrophages to improve osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) under MW irradiation. Fe3O4/Au NPs can generate &#183;O2&#8722; and heat under MW irradiation in a saline solution, and the mechanism is put forward via finite element modeling and density functional theory calculations. Due to the gap plasmon, electromagnetic hotspots are produced at Fe3O4&#8211;Au interface at 2.45&#160;GHz. Because of these induced electromagnetic hotspots, the sodium species is field&#8208;ionized and subsequently reacts with oxygen to produce &#183;O2&#8722;. Meanwhile, the Fe3O4/Au NPs have a stronger ability than Fe3O4 NPs to fix oxygen, favoring the production of ROS. Additionally, MW&#8208;treated macrophages diminish to secrete inflammatory cytokines, resulting in the decrease of ROS production in MSCs and thus enhancing their osteogenic differentiation. These engineered pseudo&#8208;macrophages will be promising for effectively treating bacterial infections and promoting osteoblast differentiation simultaneously in deep tissues under MW irradiation.

Due to the gap plasmon, electromagnetic hotspots are produced at Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;Au interface at 2.45&#160;GHz. Because of these induced electromagnetic hotspots, the sodium species is field-ionized and subsequently reacts with oxygen to produce &lt;b&gt;&#183;&lt;/b&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. Meanwhile, the Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/Au NPs have a stronger ability than Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; NPs to fix oxygen, favoring the production of ROS. Additionally, MW-treated macrophages diminish to secrete inflammatory cytokines, resulting in the decrease of ROS production in MSCs and thus enhancing their osteogenic differentiation. These engineered pseudo-macrophages will be promising for effectively treating bacterial infections and promoting osteoblast differentiation simultaneously in deep tissues under MW irradiation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Smoothing the Sodium&#8208;Metal Anode with a Self&#8208;Regulating Alloy Interface for High&#8208;Energy and Sustainable Sodium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 41, October 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;regulating alloy interface, which contains chemically sodiophilic yet electron&#8208;hindered semiconducting Na3Sb nanoislands and a sodiophobic yet electron&#8208;favored conductive Ni matrix, is reported. Benefiting from the unique self&#8208;regulating mechanism and textile&#8208;structured current collector, full cells paired with high&#8208;capacity cathode deliver a ultrahigh energy density exceeding 200&#160;Wh kg&#8211;1 with ultrahigh energy efficiency of 95.8%.








Abstract
Because of the large abundance of sodium (Na) as a source material and the easy fabrication of Na&#8208;containing compounds, the sodium (Na) battery is a more environmentally friendly and sustainable technology than the lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB). Na&#8208;metal batteries (SMBs) are considered promising to realize a high energy density to overtake the cost effectiveness of LIBs, which is critically important in large&#8208;scale applications such as grid energy storage. However, the cycling stability of the Na&#8208;metal anode faces significant challenges particularly under high cycling capacities, due to the complex failure models caused by the formation of Na dendrites. Here, a universal surface strategy, based on a self&#8208;regulating alloy interface of the current collector, to inhibit the formation of Na dendrites is reported. High&#8208;capacity (10 mAh cm&#8722;2) Na&#8208;metal anodes can achieve stable cycling for over 1000 h with a low overpotential of 35&#160;mV. When paired with a high&#8208;capacity Na3V2(PO4)2F3 cathode (7 mAh cm&#8722;2), the SMB delivers an unprecedented energy density (calculated based on all the cell components) over 200&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 with flooded electrolyte, or over 230&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 with lean electrolyte. The dendrite&#8208;free SMB also shows high cycling stability with a capacity retention per cycle over 99.9% and an ultrahigh energy efficiency of 95.8%.

         <title>Video Speed Switching of Plasmonic Structural Colors with High Contrast and Superior Lifetime</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 41, October 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electronic paper technologies are essential for reducing the energy consumption in future display devices. The first example of video speed switching of structural colors over the whole visible region is shown, while retaining high contrast. This is achieved with polarization&#8208;insensitive metasurfaces and conjugated polymers, not liquid crystals. The lifetime is shown to be over ten million cycles.








Abstract
Reflective displays or &#8220;electronic paper&#8221; technologies provide a solution to the high energy consumption of emissive displays by simply utilizing ambient light. However, it has proven challenging to develop electronic paper with competitive image quality and video speed capabilities. Here, the first technology that provides video speed switching of structural colors with high contrast over the whole visible is shown. Importantly, this is achieved with a&#160;broadband&#8208;absorbing polarization&#8208;insensitive electrochromic polymer instead of liquid crystals, which makes it possible to maintain high reflectivity. It is shown that promoting electrophoretic ion transport (drift motion) improves the switch speed. In combination with new nanostructures that have high surface curvature, this enables video speed switching (20&#160;ms) at high contrast (50% reflectivity change). A detailed analysis of the optical signal during switching shows that the polaron formation starts to obey first order reaction kinetics in the video speed regime. Additionally, the system still operates at ultralow power consumption during video speed switching (&lt;1&#160;mW cm&#8722;2) and has negligible power consumption (&lt;1 &#181;W cm&#8722;2) in bistability mode. Finally, the fast switching increases device lifetime to at least 107 cycles, an order of magnitude more than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art.

         <title>Tailor&#8208;Made Polyhydroxyalkanoates by Reconstructing Pseudomonas Entomophila</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 41, October 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performing bacterial platform for customized SCL&#8208;co&#8208;MCL/LCL PHA synthesis is developed via rational fine&#8208;tuning approaches, based on which, a series of P(3HB&#8208;co&#8208;MCL/LCL 3HA) copolymers are generated with 3HA ranging from 9 to 18 carbon atoms. The PHA copolymer family is thus further expanded, generating various novel material properties and broader prospects for value&#8208;added applications.








Abstract
Microbial polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) containing short&#8208; and medium/long&#8208;chain&#8208;length monomers, abbreviated as SCL&#8208;co&#8208;MCL/LCL PHAs, generate suitable thermal and mechanical properties. However, SCL&#8208;co&#8208;MCL/LCL PHAs with carbon chain longer than nine are difficult to synthesize due to the low specificity of PHA synthase PhaC and the lack of either SCL&#8208; or MCL/LCL monomer precursor fluxes. This study succeeds in reprogramming a &#946;&#8208;oxidation weakened Pseudomonas entomophila containing synthesis pathways of SCL 3&#8208;hydroxybutyryl&#8208;CoA (3HB) from glucose and MCL/LCL 3&#8208;hydroxyalkanoyl&#8208;CoA from fatty acids with carbon chain lengths from 9 to 18, respectively, that are polymerized under a low specificity PhaC61&#8208;3 to form P(3HB&#8208;co&#8208;MCL/LCL 3HA) copolymers. Through rational flux&#8208;tuning approaches, the optimized recombinant P. entomophila accumulates 55 wt% poly&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxybutyrate in 8.4&#160;g L&#8722;1 cell dry weight. Combined with weakened &#946;&#8208;oxidation, a series of novel P(3HB&#8208;co&#8208;MCL/LCL 3HA) copolymers with over 60 wt% PHA in 9&#160;g L&#8722;1 cell dry weight have been synthesized for the first time. P. entomophila has become a high&#8208;performing platform to generate tailor&#8208;made new SCL&#8208;co&#8208;MCL/LCL PHAs.

         <title>Stretchable Thin Film Mechanical&#8208;Strain&#8208;Gated Switches and Logic Gate Functions Based on a Soft Tunneling Barrier</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 41, October 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanical&#8208;strain&#8208;gated electric switches play a key role in sensing, soft robotics, and stretchable electronics, which typically operate an &#8220;off&#8208;switch&#8221; function&#8212;exhibiting a decrease in conductivity upon an applied strain. A thin&#8208;film architecture that features the inverse behavior, &#8220;on&#8208;switch&#8221;: a strain&#8208;induced transition from insulating to metallic conductivity, spanning nine orders of magnitude in conductivity, is demonstrated.








Abstract
Mechanical&#8208;strain&#8208;gated switches are cornerstone components of material&#8208;embedded circuits that perform logic operations without using conventional electronics. This technology requires a single material system to exhibit three distinct functionalities: strain&#8208;invariant conductivity and an increase or decrease of conductivity upon mechanical deformation. Herein, mechanical&#8208;strain&#8208;gated electric switches based on a thin&#8208;film architecture that features an insulator&#8208;to&#8208;conductor transition when mechanically stretched are demonstrated. The conductivity changes by nine orders of magnitude over a wide range of tunable working strains (as high as 130%). The approach relies on a nanometer&#8208;scale sandwiched bilayer Au thin film with an ultrathin poly(dimethylsiloxane) elastomeric barrier layer; applied strain alters the electron tunneling currents through the barrier. Mechanical&#8208;force&#8208;controlled electric logic circuits are achieved by realizing strain&#8208;controlled basic (AND and OR) and universal (NAND and NOR) logic gates in a single system. The proposed material system can be used to fabricate material&#8208;embedded logics of arbitrary complexity for a wide range of applications including soft robotics, wearable/implantable electronics, human&#8211;machine interfaces, and Internet of Things.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mechanical-strain-gated switches are cornerstone components of material-embedded circuits that perform logic operations without using conventional electronics. This technology requires a single material system to exhibit three distinct functionalities: strain-invariant conductivity and an increase or decrease of conductivity upon mechanical deformation. Herein, mechanical-strain-gated electric switches based on a thin-film architecture that features an insulator-to-conductor transition when mechanically stretched are demonstrated. The conductivity changes by nine orders of magnitude over a wide range of tunable working strains (as high as 130%). The approach relies on a nanometer-scale sandwiched bilayer Au thin film with an ultrathin poly(dimethylsiloxane) elastomeric barrier layer; applied strain alters the electron tunneling currents through the barrier. Mechanical-force-controlled electric logic circuits are achieved by realizing strain-controlled basic (AND and OR) and universal (NAND and NOR) logic gates in a single system. The proposed material system can be used to fabricate material-embedded logics of arbitrary complexity for a wide range of applications including soft robotics, wearable/implantable electronics, human&#8211;machine interfaces, and Internet of Things.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Quantum Oscillations in Ferromagnetic (Sb, V)2Te3 Topological Insulator Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 41, October 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematic study of electric transport in Sb2&#8722;xVxTe3 films demonstrates the coexistence of topological surface states and long&#8208;range ferromagnetism evidenced by Shubnikov&#8211;de Haas oscillations. Vanadium doping acts as an efficient tuning parameter for the Fermi surface size. This opens up a new route for the investigation of the crossover between different topological states based on this material class.








Abstract
An effective way of manipulating 2D surface states in magnetic topological insulators may open a new route for quantum technologies based on the quantum anomalous Hall effect. The doping&#8208;dependent evolution of the electronic band structure in the topological insulator Sb2&#8722;xVxTe3 (0&#160;&#8804;&#160;x&#160;&#8804;&#160;0.102) thin films is studied by means of electrical transport. Sb2&#8722;xVxTe3 thin films were&#160;prepared by molecular beam epitaxy, and Shubnikov&#8211;de Hass (SdH) oscillations are observed in both the longitudinal and transverse transport channels. Doping with the 3d element, vanadium, induces long&#8208;range ferromagnetic order with enhanced SdH oscillation amplitudes. The doping effect is systematically studied in various films depending on thickness and bottom gate voltage. The angle&#8208;dependence of the SdH oscillations reveals their 2D nature, linking them to topological surface states as their origin. Furthermore, it is shown that vanadium doping can efficiently modify the band structure. The tunability by doping and the coexistence of the surface states with ferromagnetism render Sb2&#8722;xVxTe3 thin films a promising platform for energy band engineering. In this way, topological quantum states may be manipulated to crossover from quantum Hall effect to quantum anomalous Hall effect, which opens an alternative route for the design of quantum electronics and spintronics.

         <title>Selective Thrombosis of Tumor for Enhanced Hypoxia&#8208;Activated Prodrug Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 41, October 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional nanoplatform is developed by encapsulating coagulation&#8208;inducing protease thrombin and a hypoxia&#8208;activated prodrug tirapazamine into metal&#8211;organic framework nanoparticles with a tumor&#8208;homing ligand, which can selectively activate platelet aggregation at a tumor to induce thrombosis and vascular obstruction therapy. Meanwhile, the thrombus can cut off the blood oxygen supply and potentiate the hypoxia level to enhance the prodrug therapy.








Abstract
One of the main challenges for tumor vascular infarction in combating cancer lies in failing to produce sustained complete thrombosis. Inspired by the capability of vascular infarction in blocking the delivery of oxygen to aggravate tumor hypoxia, the performance of selective tumor thrombus inducing hypoxia activation therapy to improve the therapeutic index of coagulation&#8208;based tumor therapy is presented. By encapsulating coagulation&#8208;inducing protease thrombin and a hypoxia&#8208;activated prodrug (HAP) tirapazamine into metal&#8211;organic framework nanoparticles with a tumor&#8208;homing ligand, the obtained nanoplatform selectively activates platelet aggregation at the tumor to induce thrombosis and vascular obstruction therapy by the exposed thrombin. Meanwhile, the thrombus can cut off the blood oxygen supply and potentiate the hypoxia levels to enhance the HAP therapy. This strategy not only addresses the dissatisfaction of vascular therapy, but also conquers the dilemma of inadequate hypoxia in HAP treatment. Since clinical operations such as surgery can be used to induce coagulation, coagulation&#8208;based synergistic therapy is promising for translation into a clinical combination regimen.

         <title>Synergistic Effect of Atomically Dispersed Ni&#8211;Zn Pair Sites for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 41, October 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic effect induced by electronic interactions is observed on novel atomically dispersed Ni&#8211;Zn pair sites with superior activity and outstanding selectivity for CO2 electroreduction; better yet, the origin of this synergistic effect is revealed, both in the thermodynamic pathway and kinetic pathway.








Abstract
Dual&#8208;atom catalysts have the potential to outperform the well&#8208;established single&#8208;atom catalysts for the electrochemical conversion of CO2. However, the lack of understanding regarding the mechanism of this enhanced catalytic process prevents the rational design of high&#8208;performance catalysts. Herein, an obvious synergistic effect in atomically dispersed Ni&#8211;Zn bimetal sites is observed. In situ characterization combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveals that heteronuclear coordination modifies the d&#8208;states of the metal atom, narrowing the gap between the d&#8208;band centre (&#949;d) of the Ni (3d) orbitals and the Fermi energy level (EF) to strengthen the electronic interaction at the reaction interface, resulting in a lower free energy barrier (&#916;G) in the thermodynamic pathway and a reduced activation energy (Ea) as well as fortified metal&#8211;C bonding in the kinetic pathway. Consequently, a CO faradaic efficiency of &gt;90% is obtained across a broad potential window from &#8722;0.5 to &#8722;1.0&#160;V (vs RHE), reaching a maximum of 99% at &#8722;0.8&#160;V, superior to that of the Ni/Zn single&#8208;metal sites.

         <title>Sub&#8208;Monolayer YOx/MoOx on Ultrathin Pt Nanowires Boosts Alcohol Oxidation Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 41, October 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of sub&#8208;monolayer YOx/MoOx&#8208;surface&#8208;co&#8208;decorated ultrathin platinum (Pt) nanowires is demonstrated to effectively boost alcohol oxidation electrocatalysis. The surface Y and Mo atoms make the free energies of CO* and COOH* be decoupled on the nanowire surfaces, lowering the energy barriers for the oxidation of CO* into COOH*.








Abstract
A crucial issue restricting the application of direct alcohol fuel cells (DAFCs) is the low activity of Pt&#8208;based electrocatalysts for alcohol oxidation reaction caused by the reaction intermediate (CO*) poisoning. Herein, a new strategy is demonstrated for making a class of sub&#8208;monolayer YOx/MoOx&#8208;surface co&#8208;decorated ultrathin platinum nanowires (YOx/MoOx&#8211;Pt NWs) to effectively eliminate the CO poisoning for enhancing methanol oxidation electrocatalysis. By adjusting the amounts of YOx and MoOx decorated on the surface of ultrathin Pt NWs, the optimized 22% YOx/MoOx&#8211;Pt NWs achieve a high specific activity of 3.35&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a mass activity of 2.10 A mgPt&#8722;1, as well as the enhanced stability. In situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and CO stripping studies confirm the contribution of YOx and MoOx to anti&#8208;CO poisoning ability of the NWs. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further reveal that the surface Y and Mo atoms with oxidation states allow COOH* to bind the surface through both the carbon and oxygen atoms, which can lower the free energy barriers for the oxidation of CO* into COOH*. The optimal NWs also show the superior activities toward the electro&#8208;oxidation of ethanol, ethylene glycol, and glycerol.

&lt;/i&gt;&#8211;Pt NWs achieve a high specific activity of 3.35&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a mass activity of 2.10 A mg&lt;sub&gt;Pt&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, as well as the enhanced stability. In situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and CO stripping studies confirm the contribution of YO&lt;i&gt;

&lt;/i&gt; to anti-CO poisoning ability of the NWs. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further reveal that the surface Y and Mo atoms with oxidation states allow COOH* to bind the surface through both the carbon and oxygen atoms, which can lower the free energy barriers for the oxidation of CO* into COOH*. The optimal NWs also show the superior activities toward the electro-oxidation of ethanol, ethylene glycol, and glycerol.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ambulatory Cardiovascular Monitoring Via a Machine&#8208;Learning&#8208;Assisted Textile Triboelectric Sensor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 41, October 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A waterproof textile&#8208;based wearable cardiovascular monitoring system is developed via systematic integration of a triboelectric sensor, a signal processing circuit, a Bluetooth module, and a customized user&#8208;friendly app interface. With the assistance of machine&#8208;learning algorithms, this system can perform continuous blood pressure monitoring against body motion and perspiration.








Abstract
Wearable bioelectronics for continuous and reliable pulse wave monitoring against body motion and perspiration remains a great challenge and highly desired. Here, a low&#8208;cost, lightweight, and mechanically durable textile triboelectric sensor that can convert subtle skin deformation caused by arterial pulsatility into electricity for high&#8208;fidelity and continuous pulse waveform monitoring in an ambulatory and sweaty setting is developed. The sensor holds a signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio of 23.3 dB, a response time of 40 ms, and a sensitivity of 0.21 &#181;A kPa&#8722;1. With the assistance of machine learning algorithms, the textile triboelectric sensor can continuously and precisely measure systolic and diastolic pressure, and the accuracy is validated via a commercial blood pressure cuff at the hospital. Additionally, a customized cellphone application (APP) based on built&#8208;in algorithm is developed for one&#8208;click health data sharing and data&#8208;driven cardiovascular diagnosis. The textile triboelectric sensor enabled wireless biomonitoring system is expected to offer a practical paradigm for continuous and personalized cardiovascular system characterization in the era of the Internet of Things.

         <title>Pangolin&#8208;Inspired Stretchable, Microwave&#8208;Invisible Metascale</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 41, October 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pangolin&#8208;inspired metascale is developed to simultaneously realize stretchable and microwave&#8208;invisible functions. The elastomeric matrix endows the metascale with high stretchability, and therefore nondevelopable surface conformality. The overlapping arrangement of electromagnetic dissipative scales ensures the metascale has robust microwave&#8208;absorbing capacity under the interference of mechanical deformation and also plays significant role in resisting out&#8208;of&#8208;plane puncture damage.








Abstract
Microwave&#8208;invisible devices are emerging as a valuable technology in various applications, including soft robotics, shape&#8208;morphing structures, and textural camouflages, especially in electronic countermeasures. Unfortunately, conventional microwave&#8208;absorbing metastructures and bulk absorbers are stretching confined, limiting their application in deformable or special&#8208;shaped targets. To overcome such limitations, a conceptually novel soft&#8211;rigid&#8208;connection strategy, inspired by the pangolin, is proposed. Pangolin&#8208;inspired metascale (PIMS), which is a kind of stretchable metamaterial consisting of an electromagnetic dissipative scale (EMD&#8208;scale) and elastomer, is rationally designed. Such a device exhibits robust microwave&#8208;absorbing capacity under the interference of 50% stretching. Besides, profiting from the covering effect and size&#8208;confined effect of EMD&#8208;scale, the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane indentation failure force of PIMS is at least 5 times larger than conventional device. As a proof of concept, the proposed device is conformally pasted on nondevelopable surfaces. For a spherical dome surface, the maximum radar cross&#8208;section (RCS) reduction of PIMS is 6.3&#160;dB larger than that of a conventional device, while for a saddle surface, the bandwidth of 10&#160;dB RCS reduction exhibits an increase of 83%. In short, this work provides a conceptually novel platform to develop stretchable, nondevelopable surface conformable functional devices.

         <title>A Pyrite Iron Disulfide Cathode with a Copper Current Collector for High&#8208;Energy Reversible Magnesium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 41, October 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Effective Mg&#8208;ion storage of an apyrite FeS2 cathode is realized by introducing a redox couple of cuprous sulfide and copper, originating from the copper current collector. An impressive energy density of 714&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 dominated by a four&#8208;electron conversion reaction (Fe2+/Fe and S22&#8722;/S2&#8722;) and good cycling stability over 1000 cycles of the as&#8208;prepared FeS2 nanomaterial cathode are achieved.








Abstract
Owing to its low cost, high theoretical capacity, and environmentally friendly characteristics, pyrite FeS2 demonstrates promise as a cathode material for high&#8208;energy metal&#8208;anode&#8208;based rechargeable batteries. When it is used in a rechargeable magnesium battery (RMB), the electrode couple exhibits an extremely low theoretical volume change upon full discharge. However, its electrochemical Mg&#8208;ion storage is considerably hindered by slow reaction kinetics. In this study, a high&#8208;performance FeS2 cathode for RMBs using a copper current collector is reported, which is involved in cathode reactions via a reversible redox process between copper and cuprous sulfide. This phase transformation with the formation of copper nanowires during discharge activates the redox reactions of FeS2 via a two&#8208;step and four&#8208;electron Mg&#8208;ion transfer that dominates the cathode reactions. As a result, the as&#8208;prepared FeS2 nanomaterial cathode delivers a significantly enhanced reversible capacity of 679 mAh g&#8722;1 at 50&#160;mA g&#8722;1. The corresponding energy density of 714&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 is superior to those of all previously reported metal chalcogenide cathodes in RMBs or hybrid batteries using a Mg metal anode. Notably, the as&#8208;assembled FeS2&#8211;Mg battery can operate over 1000 cycles with a good capacity retention at 400&#160;mA g&#8722;1.

         <title>Designing New&#8208;Generation Piezoelectric Transducers by Embedding Superior Graphene&#8208;Based Thermal Regulators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 41, October 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient multidirectional heat&#8208;escape channels are constructed via synthesizing a brand&#8208;new chemical&#8208;vapor&#8208;deposition&#8208;derived 3D/2D graphene homojunction on an AlN&#8208;thermosensitive&#8208;ceramic template. New&#8208;generation cascaded&#8208;piezoelectric&#8208;transducers are designed and constructed via embedding the 3D/2D&#8208;graphene/AlN&#8208;ceramic&#8208;based thermal regulators, which can simultaneously uniformize, transmit, and release heat. The self&#8208;heating&#8208;caused temperature rise is substantially reduced by &#8776;60%, along with dramatically enhanced electroacoustic&#8208;energy&#8208;conversion efficiency and amplitude.








Abstract
Cascaded&#8208;piezoelectric&#8208;transducers (CPETs) is a key component in modern energy&#8208;conversion fields, possessing versatile applications in ultrasonic scalpels, acoustic levitation, and sonar. However, serious self&#8208;heating inevitably occurs inside high&#8208;power CPETs, severely limiting their practical applications in broader fields. To tackle this, multidirectional heat&#8208;escape channels of multidimensional (multi&#8208;D, 3D/2D) graphene films are introduced in designing new&#8208;type thermal regulators. A porous AlN&#8208;ceramic thermal&#8208;sink is creatively selected as a template for directly synthesizing graphene via a two&#8208;step chemical vapor deposition strategy. This perfect combination of 3D/2D&#8208;graphene and the AlN ceramic can integrate their complementary advantages in uniformizing, transmitting, and releasing heat. Amazingly, in the new&#8208;generation CPETs embedded with these graphene&#8208;based thermal regulators, the self&#8208;heating&#8208;induced temperature rise can be substantially reduced by &#8776;60% (far exceeding actual demand standard). As another kernel parameter, electroacoustic&#8208;energy&#8208;conversion efficiency is dramatically improved in the new&#8208;generation CPETs. Briefly, this research realizes the first synthesis of a novel multi&#8208;D&#8208;graphene/AlN&#8208;ceramic hybrid, and propels its brand&#8208;new application directions in new&#8208;generation energy&#8208;conversion&#8208; and thermal&#8208;management&#8208;related territories.

Amazingly, in the new-generation CPETs embedded with these graphene-based thermal regulators, the self-heating-induced temperature rise can be substantially reduced by &#8776;60% (far exceeding actual demand standard). As another kernel parameter, electroacoustic-energy-conversion efficiency is dramatically improved in the new-generation CPETs. Briefly, this research realizes the first synthesis of a novel multi-D-graphene/AlN-ceramic hybrid, and propels its brand-new application directions in new-generation energy-conversion- and thermal-management-related territories.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Injectable Meta&#8208;Biomaterial: From Design and Simulation to In Vivo Shaping and Tissue Induction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 41, October 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metamaterials gain unusual properties through their microstructure rather than specific chemistry. An elastic, porous, and injectable (EPI) microscaffold metamaterial is simulated and designed. The EPI provides experimental proof to the conjecture of elastic strain softening in microgel suspensions. Initially shapeable, it dynamically matches the local tissue mechanics, and templates long&#8208;term soft tissue colonization and vascularization.








Abstract
A novel type of injectable biomaterial with an elastic softening transition is described. The material enables in&#160;vivo shaping, followed by induction of 3D stable vascularized tissue. The synthesis of the injectable meta&#8208;biomaterial is instructed by extensive numerical simulation as a suspension of irregularly fragmented, highly porous sponge&#8208;like microgels. The irregular particle shape dramatically enhances yield strain for in&#160;vivo stability against deformation. Porosity of the particles, along with friction between internal surfaces, provides the elastic softening transition. This emergent metamaterial property enables the material to reversibly change stiffness during deformation, allowing native tissue properties to be matched over a wide range of deformation amplitudes. After subcutaneous injection in mice, predetermined shapes can be sculpted manually. The 3D shape is maintained during excellent host tissue integration, with induction of vascular connective tissue that persists to the end of one&#8208;year follow&#8208;up. The geometrical design is compatible with many hydrogel materials, including cell&#8208;adhesion motives for cell transplantation. The injectable meta&#8208;biomaterial therefore provides new perspectives in soft tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.

         <title>Hybrid Dielectric Films of Inkjet&#8208;Printable Core&#8211;Shell Nanoparticles</title>

A new type of core&#8211;shell nanoparticle dielectric that is suitable for inkjet printing is presented. Gold cores are covalently grafted with polystyrene. The resulting inks are used to spin&#8208;coat and inkjet&#8208;print dielectric films. The covalently attached shell prevents percolation and ensures high dielectric constants without the risk of dielectric breakdown.








A new type of hybrid core&#8211;shell nanoparticle dielectric that is suitable for inkjet printing is introduced. Gold cores (dcore&#160;&#8776; 4.5 nm diameter) are covalently grafted with thiol&#8208;terminated polystyrene (Mn&#160;= 11000 Da and Mn&#160;= 5000 Da) and used as inks to spin&#8208;coat and inkjet&#8208;print dielectric films. The dielectric layers have&#160;metal volume fractions of 5 to 21 vol% with either random or face&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic structures depending on the polymer length and grafting density. Films with 21 vol% metal have&#160;dielectric constants of 50@1 Hz. Structural and electrical characterization using transmission electron microscopy, small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, and impedance spectroscopy indicates that classical random capacitor&#8211;resistor network models partially describe this hybrid material but fail at high metal fractions, where the covalently attached shell prevents percolation and ensures high dielectric constants without the risk of dielectric breakdown. A comparison of disordered to ordered films indicates that the network structure affects dielectric properties less than the metal content. The applicability of the new dielectric material is demonstrated by formulating inkjet inks and printing devices. An inkjet&#8208;printed capacitor with an area of 0.79 mm2 and a 17 nm thick dielectric had&#160;a capacitance of 2.2&#177;0.1&#8201;nF@1&#8201;kHz.

         <title>Dilute Aqueous&#8208;Aprotic Hybrid Electrolyte Enabling a Wide Electrochemical Window through Solvation Structure Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 41, October 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dilute aqueous&#8208;aprotic hybrid electrolyte is developed with broad electrochemical window. The introduced aprotic solvent can regulate the solvation structures of the electrolyte and the water molecules are strongly confined around the Na cations. As a result, in such a hybrid electrolyte, the decomposition of water is suppressed and the electrochemical window of the water is broadened.








Abstract
The application of superconcentrated aqueous electrolytes has shown great potential in developing high&#8208;voltage electrochemical double&#8208;layer capacitors (EDLCs). However, the broadening of the electrochemical window of such superconcentrated electrolytes is at the expense of their high cost, low ionic conductivity, high density, and narrow operating temperature range. Herein, the electrochemical window of water (&gt;3&#160;V) at low salt concentration (3 m) is expanded by using an aprotic solvent, i.e., trimethyl phosphate (TMP), to regulate the solvation structure of the electrolyte. Benefiting from the low salt concentration, such electrolyte is simultaneously featured with high ionic conductivity, low density, and wide temperature compatibility. Based on the dilute hybrid electrolyte, EDLCs constructed by using porous graphene electrodes are able to operate within an enlarged voltage range of 0&#8211;2.4&#160;V at a wide range of temperatures from &#8722;20 to 60&#160;&#176;C. They also present excellent rate capability and cycle stability, i.e., 83% capacitance retention after 100&#160;000 cycles. Density functional theory calculations verify that TMP induces a significant electronic modulation for the bonding environment of the electrolyte. This enables the stronger binding of Na+&#8211;H2O with freely migrating TMP to expand the voltage window to exceed the potential limitation of aqueous electrolytes.

         <title>Electrode&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Healed Monolayer MoS2 for High Performance Transistors and Phototransistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 41, October 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel sulfide electrode system allows sulfur&#8208;vacancy self&#8208;healing in 2D MoS2. Ultrathin CuS electrode heals defects in the MoS2 channel spontaneously upon mild thermal annealing. The self&#8208;healed CuS/MoS2 transistors and phototransistors show impressive device performance.








Abstract
Contact engineering for monolayered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) is considered to be of fundamental challenge for realizing high&#8208;performance TMDCs&#8208;based (opto) electronic devices. Here, an innovative concept is established for a device configuration with metallic copper monosulfide (CuS) electrodes that induces sulfur vacancy healing in the monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) channel. Excess sulfur adatoms from the metallic CuS electrodes are donated to heal sulfur vacancy defects in MoS2 that surprisingly improve the overall performance of its devices. The electrode&#8208;induced self&#8208;healing mechanism is demonstrated and analyzed systematically using various spectroscopic analyses, density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and electrical measurements. Without any passivation layers, the self&#8208;healed MoS2 (photo)transistor with the CuS contact electrodes show outstanding room temperature field effect mobility of 97.6 cm2 (Vs)&#8722;1, On/Off ratio &gt; 108,&#160;low subthreshold swing of 120&#160;mV per decade, high photoresponsivity of 1 &#215; 104&#160;A W&#8722;1, and detectivity of 1013 jones, which are the best among back&#8208;gated transistors that employ 1L MoS2. Using ultrathin and flexible 2D CuS and MoS2, mechanically flexible photosensor is also demonstrated, which shows excellent durability under mechanical strain. These findings demonstrate a promising strategy in TMDCs or other 2D material for the development of high performance and functional devices including self&#8208;healable sulfide electrodes.

         <title>Fully Bottom&#8208;Up Waste&#8208;Free Growth of Ultrathin Silicon Wafer via Self&#8208;Releasing Seed Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 41, October 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully bottom&#8208;up technique for fabricating a self&#8208;releasing ultrathin silicon wafer without sacrificing any of the substrate is presented, whereas conventional technologies waste large amounts of such material. A plasma&#8208;assisted epitaxially grown silicon seed layer with a self&#8208;organized nanogap is a key for the realization of the fully bottom&#8208;up process. The results represent a technological breakthrough in advanced silicon microelectronics and photovoltaics.








Abstract
The fabrication of ultrathin silicon wafers at low cost is crucial for advancing silicon electronics toward stretchability and flexibility. However, conventional fabrication techniques are inefficient because they sacrifice a large amount of substrate material. Thus, advanced silicon electronics that have been realized in laboratories cannot move forward to commercialization. Here, a fully bottom&#8208;up technique for producing a self&#8208;releasing ultrathin silicon wafer without sacrificing any of the substrate is presented. The key to this approach is a self&#8208;organized nanogap on the substrate fabricated by plasma&#8208;assisted epitaxial growth (plasma&#8208;epi) and subsequent hydrogen annealing. The wafer thickness can be independently controlled during the bulk growth after the formation of plasma&#8208;epi seed layer. In addition, semiconductor devices are realized using the ultrathin silicon wafer. Given the high scalability of plasma&#8208;epi and its compatibility with conventional semiconductor process, the proposed bottom&#8208;up wafer fabrication process will open a new route to developing advanced silicon electronics.

         <title>Pathologically Responsive Mitochondrial Gene Therapy in an Allotopic Expression&#8208;Independent Manner Cures Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 41, October 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pathologically responsive mitochondrial gene therapy referred to as &#8220;TISUH&#8221; in an allotopic expression&#8208;independent manner achieves accurately in situ mitochondrial gene delivery. It is a novel nanomedicine harnessing pathological characteristics to import exogenous gene into mitochondria for Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy treatment, a capability that has potential to model mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutated disorders and correct genetic abnormalities in other mtDNA mutated diseases.








Abstract
Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) is a rare inherited blindness caused by mutations in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). The disorder is untreatable and tricky, as the existing chemotherapeutic agent Idebenone alleviates symptoms rather than overcoming the underlying cause. Although some studies have made progress on allotopic expression for LHON, in situ mitochondrial gene therapy remains challenging, which may simplify delivery procedures to be a promising therapeutic for LHON. LHON becomes more difficult to manage in the changed mitochondrial microenvironment, including increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreasing mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Herein, a pathologically responsive mitochondrial gene delivery vector named [triphenylphosphine&#8208;terminated poly(sulfur&#8208;containing thioketal undecafluorohexylamine histamine) and Ide&#8208;terminated poly(sulfur&#8208;containing thioketal undecafluorohexylamine histamine)] (TISUH) is reported to facilitate commendable in situ mitochondrial gene therapy for LHON. TISUH directly targets diseased mitochondria via triphenylphosphine and fluorination addressing the decreasing MMP. In addition, TISUH can be disassembled by high mitochondrial ROS levels to release functional genes for enhancing gene transfection efficiency and fundamentally correcting genetic abnormalities. In both traditional and gene&#8208;mutation&#8208;induced LHON mouse models, TISUH&#8208;mediated gene therapy shows satisfactory curative effect through the sustained therapeutic protein expression in vivo. This work proposes a novel pathologically responsive in situ mitochondrial delivery platform and provides a promising approach for refractory LHON as well as other mtDNA mutated diseases treatments.

         <title>Triple&#8208;Jump Photodynamic Theranostics: MnO2 Combined Upconversion Nanoplatforms Involving a Type&#8208;I Photosensitizer with Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Characteristics for Potent Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 41, October 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A triple&#8208;jump photodynamic theranostics protocol is explored for high&#8208;efficacy cancer treatment, by establishing an intelligent glutathione&#8208;depleting and NIR&#8208;regulated theranostic nanoplatform comprising a MnO2 nanoshell, upconversion nanoparticles, and aggregation&#8208;induced emission&#8208;active Type&#8208;I photosensitizers.








Abstract
The development of multifunctional nanoplatforms has been recognized as a promising strategy for potent photodynamic theranostics. Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) photosensitizers undergoing Type&#8208;I reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation pathway appear as potential candidates due to their capability of hypoxia&#8208;tolerance, efficient ROS production, and fluorescence imaging navigation. To further improve their performance, a facile and universal method of constructing a type of glutathione (GSH)&#8208;depleting and near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;regulated nanoplatform for dual&#8208;modal imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy (PDT) is presented. The nanoplatforms are obtained through the coprecipitation process involving upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) and AIE&#8208;active photosensitizers, followed by in situ generation of MnO2 as the outer shell. The introduction of UCNPs actualizes the NIR&#8208;activation of AIE&#8208;active photosensitizers to produce &#183;OH as a Type&#8208;I ROS. Intracellular upregulated GSH&#8208;responsive decomposition of the MnO2 shell to Mn2+ realizes GSH&#8208;depletion, which is a distinctive approach for elevating intracellular &#183;OH. Meanwhile, the generated Mn2+ can implement T1&#8208;weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in specific tumor sites, and mediate the conversion of intracellular H2O2 to &#183;OH. These outputs reveal a triple&#8208;jump &#183;OH production, and this approach brings about distinguished performance in FLI&#8208;MRI&#8208;guided PDT with high&#8208;efficacy, which presents great potential for future clinical translations.

         <title>Variability and Yield in h&#8208;BN&#8208;Based Memristive Circuits: The Role of Each Type of Defect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 41, October 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large (up to 10 kbit) crossbar arrays of nano&#8208;memristors (down to 320&#160;nm &#215; 420&#160;nm) using hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) are fabricated, and their yield and variability are studied. The atomic defects in h&#8208;BN lead to deviations of the electrical characteristics of the devices, while wrinkles, polymer residues, thicker islands, and gaps with the substrate have no remarkable effect.








Abstract
In the race of fabricating solid&#8208;state nano/microelectronic devices using 2D layered materials (LMs), achieving high yield and low device&#8208;to&#8208;device variability are the two main challenges. Electronic devices that drive currents in&#8208;plane and homogeneously along the 2D&#8208;LMs (i.e., transistors, memtransistors) are strongly affected by local defects (i.e., grain boundaries, wrinkles, thickness fluctuations, polymer residues), as they create inhomogeneities and increase the device&#8208;to&#8208;device variability, resulting in a poor performance at the circuit level. Here, it is shown that memristors are insensitive to most types of defects in 2D&#8208;LMs, even when fabricated in academic laboratories that do not meet industrial standards. The reason is that the currents produced in these devices, which flow out&#8208;of&#8208;plane across the 2D&#8208;LM, are always driven locally by the most conductive locations. Consequently, it is concluded that it is much easier to fabricate 2D&#8208;LMs&#8208;based solid&#8208;state nano/microelectronic circuits using memristors than using transistors or memtransistors, not only due to the inherent simpler fabrication process (i.e., less lithography steps) but also because the local defects do not degrade the yield and variability of memristors considerably.

         <title>Sub&#8208;Picosecond Non&#8208;Equilibrium States in the Amorphous Phase of GeTe Phase&#8208;Change Material Thin Films</title>

         <dc:description>
The sub&#8208;picosecond response of amorphous GeTe thin film to femtosecond laser excitation is investigated using frequency&#8208;domain interferometry and ab initio molecular dynamics. The results shed a new light on the optically highly excited states in chalcogenide materials involved in both important processes: phase&#8208;change materials in memory devices and ovonic threshold switching phenomenon induced by a static field.








Abstract
The sub&#8208;picosecond response of amorphous germanium telluride thin film to a femtosecond laser excitation is investigated using frequency&#8208;domain interferometry and ab initio molecular dynamics. The time&#8208;resolved measurement of the surface dynamics reveals a shrinkage of the film with a dielectric properties&#8217; response faster than 300 fs. The systematic ab initio molecular dynamics simulations in non&#8208;equilibrium conditions allow the atomic configurations to be retrieved for ionic temperature from 300 to 1100 K and width of the electron distribution from 0.001 to 1.0 eV. Local order of the structures is characterized by in&#8208;depth analysis of the angle distribution, phonon modes, and pair distribution function, which evidence a transition toward a new amorphous electronic excited state close in bonding/structure to the liquid state. The results shed a new light on the optically highly excited states in chalcogenide materials involved in both important processes: phase&#8208;change materials in memory devices and ovonic threshold switching phenomenon induced by a static&#160;field.

         <title>High Antibacterial Activity and Selectivity of the Versatile Polysulfoniums that Combat Drug Resistance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 41, October 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel type of polypeptoid sulfoniums prepared by ring&#8208;opening polymerization and post&#8208;polymerization functionalization exhibit high selectivity and potent in vitro and in vivo antibacterial efficacy with negligible antibacterial resistance. The polymers also show great efficiency in inhibiting Staphylococcus aureus biofilm formations, as well as in further eradicating the mature biofilms.








Abstract
Sulfonium&#8208;ion&#8208;containing polymers exhibit significant potential benefits for various applications. An efficient strategy to synthesize a type of antibacterial sulfonium&#8208;ion&#8208;bearing polypeptoids via a combination of ring&#8208;opening polymerization and a post&#8208;polymerization functionalization with various functional epoxides is presented. A systematic investigation is further performed in order to explore the influence of the overall hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance on the antimicrobial activity and selectivity of the prepared polysulfoniums. Notably, those chlorepoxypropane&#8208;modified polysulfoniums with an optimized amphiphilic balance show higher selectivity toward both Gram&#8208;negative Escherichia coli and Gram&#8208;positive Staphylococcus aureus, than to red blood cells. The polymers also show great efficiency in inhibiting S. aureus biofilm formations, as well as in further eradicating the mature biofilms. Remarkably, negligible antibacterial resistance and cross&#8208;resistance to commercial antibiotics is shown in these polymers. The polysulfoniums further show their potent in vivo antimicrobial efficacy in a multidrug&#8208;resistant S. aureus infection model that is developed on mouse skin. Similar to the antimicrobial peptides, the polysulfoniums are demonstrated to kill bacteria through membrane disruption. The obtained polypeptoid sulfoniums, with high selectivity and potent antibacterial property, are excellent candidates for antibacterial treatment and open up new possibilities for the preparation of a class of innovative antimicrobials.

         <title>Stretchable and Highly Permeable Nanofibrous Sensors for Detecting Complex Human Body Motion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 41, October 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design and fabrication of stretchable and highly permeable nanofibrous sensors made from polyaniline is reported. The device produces an intimate connection with solid or living objects and has a very precise performance in discriminating between bending and twisting stimuli at different angles and speeds, as well as in the detection of complex human&#8208;body motions.








Abstract
Wearable strain sensors have been attracting special attention in the detection of human posture and activity, as well as for the assessment of physical rehabilitation and kinematics. However, it is a challenge to fabricate stretchable and comfortable&#8208;to&#8208;wear permeable strain sensors that can provide highly accurate and continuous motion recording while exerting minimal constraints and maintaining low interference with the body. Herein, covalently grafting nanofibrous polyaniline (PANI) onto stretchable elastomer nanomeshes is reported to obtain a freestanding ultrathin (varying from 300 to 10 000&#160;nm) strain sensor that has high gas permeability (10&#8211;33&#160;mg h&#8211;1). The sensor demonstrates a low weight and can be directly laminated onto the dynamic human skin for long periods of time. The sensor, which produces an intimate connection with solid or living objects, has a stable performance with excellent sustainability, linearity, durability, and low hysteresis. It exibits excellent performance for continuous interrogation of complex movements, mimicking muscle activities, and resembling brain activity. This includes a very precise discrimination of bending and twisting stimuli at different angles (1&#8211;180&#176;) and speeds (3&#8211;18&#160;rpm) and very low exertion of counter&#8208;interference. These results imply the utility of this appraoch for advanced developments of robotic e&#8208;skins or e&#8208;muscles.

         <title>Design of Aligned Porous Carbon Films with Single&#8208;Atom Co&#8211;N&#8211;C Sites for High&#8208;Current&#8208;Density Hydrogen Generation</title>

         <dc:description>
A film electrode consisting of atomic Co&#8211;N&#8211;C sites dispersed on vertically aligned porous nanocarbon is designed, with merits of high intrinsic activity, enriched number of active sites, and efficient mass transport of both the liquid reactant and the gaseous product, enabling it to be used for high&#8208;current&#8208;density hydrogen generation with high activity and stability.








Abstract
Metal&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (M&#8211;N&#8211;C) materials as a unique class of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have increasingly attracted attention as the replacement of platinum for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER); however, their employment as HER electrodes at high current densities of industrial level remains a grand challenge. Herein, an aligned porous carbon film embedded with single&#8208;atom Co&#8211;N&#8211;C sites of exceptional activity and stability at high current densities is designed. Within the film, the atomic CoNx moieties exhibit high intrinsic activity, while the multiscale porosity of the carbon frameworks with vertically aligned microchannels afford facilitated mass transfer under the conditions of high production rate and ultrathick electrodes. Moreover, the superwetting properties of the film promote electrolyte wetting and ensure the timely removal of the evolving H2 gas bubbles. The as&#8208;designed film can work as an efficient HER electrode to deliver 500 and 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in acid at overpotentials of 272 and 343&#160;mV, respectively, and can operate uninterruptedly and stably at 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for at least 32 h under static conditions. These findings pave the road toward the rational design of SACs with improved activity and stability at high current densities in gas&#8208;evolving electrocatalytic processes.

         <title>Carbon Nanotube&#8211;Hydrogel Composites Facilitate Neuronal Differentiation While Maintaining Homeostasis of Network Activity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 41, October 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new, versatile method for the preparation of carbon nanotube&#8211;poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogel composites is developed. The effects of the composites on neuronal differentiation and activity of pheochromocytoma 12 (PC12) cells, adult neural stem cells, and primary hippocampal neurons are investigated. It is demonstrated that the composites can serve as effective scaffolds promoting neuronal differentiation while maintaining network activity homeostasis.








Abstract
It is often assumed that carbon nanotubes (CNTs) stimulate neuronal differentiation by transferring electrical signals and enhancing neuronal excitability. Given this, CNT&#8211;hydrogel composites are regarded as potential materials able to combine high electrical conductivity with biocompatibility, and therefore promote nerve regeneration. However, whether CNT&#8211;hydrogel composites actually influence neuronal differentiation and maturation, and how they do so remain elusive. In this study, CNT&#8211;hydrogel composites are prepared by in situ polymerization of poly(ethylene glycol) around a preformed CNT meshwork. It is demonstrated that the composites facilitate long&#8208;term survival and differentiation of pheochromocytoma 12 cells. Adult neural stem cells cultured on the composites show an increased neuron&#8208;to&#8208;astrocyte ratio and higher synaptic connectivity. Moreover, primary hippocampal neurons cultured on composites maintain morphological synaptic features as well as their neuronal network activity evaluated by spontaneous calcium oscillations, which are comparable to neurons cultured under control conditions. These results indicate that the composites are promising materials that could indeed facilitate neuronal differentiation while maintaining neuronal homeostasis.

&lt;p&gt;A new, versatile method for the preparation of carbon nanotube&#8211;poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogel composites is developed. The effects of the composites on neuronal differentiation and activity of pheochromocytoma 12 (PC12) cells, adult neural stem cells, and primary hippocampal neurons are investigated. It is demonstrated that the composites can serve as effective scaffolds promoting neuronal differentiation while maintaining network activity homeostasis.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is often assumed that carbon nanotubes (CNTs) stimulate neuronal differentiation by transferring electrical signals and enhancing neuronal excitability. Given this, CNT&#8211;hydrogel composites are regarded as potential materials able to combine high electrical conductivity with biocompatibility, and therefore promote nerve regeneration. However, whether CNT&#8211;hydrogel composites actually influence neuronal differentiation and maturation, and how they do so remain elusive. In this study, CNT&#8211;hydrogel composites are prepared by in situ polymerization of poly(ethylene glycol) around a preformed CNT meshwork. It is demonstrated that the composites facilitate long-term survival and differentiation of pheochromocytoma 12 cells. Adult neural stem cells cultured on the composites show an increased neuron-to-astrocyte ratio and higher synaptic connectivity. Moreover, primary hippocampal neurons cultured on composites maintain morphological synaptic features as well as their neuronal network activity evaluated by spontaneous calcium oscillations, which are comparable to neurons cultured under control conditions. These results indicate that the composites are promising materials that could indeed facilitate neuronal differentiation while maintaining neuronal homeostasis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Evolving Devil's Staircase Magnetization from Tunable Charge Density Waves in Nonsymmorphic Dirac Semimetals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 41, October 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fractionally quantized Hall plateaus originate from translational symmetry breaking in 2D systems. It is also possible to observe similar quantization of other physical properties in bulk materials in the presence of coupled collective excitations. Such a state is realized and tuned by changing the electron count in CeSbTe. It also creates an idealized nonsymmorphic Dirac semimetal state in this compound.








Abstract
While several magnetic topological semimetals have been discovered in recent years, their band structures are far from ideal, often obscured by trivial bands at the Fermi energy. Square&#8208;net materials with clean, linearly dispersing bands show potential to circumvent this issue. CeSbTe, a square&#8208;net material, features multiple magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;controllable topological phases. Here, it is shown that in this material, even higher degrees of tunability can be achieved by changing the electron count at the square&#8208;net motif. Increased electron filling results in structural distortion and formation of charge density waves (CDWs). The modulation wave&#8208;vector evolves continuously leading to a region of multiple discrete CDWs and a corresponding complex &#8220;Devil's staircase&#8221; magnetic ground state. A series of fractionally quantized magnetization plateaus is observed, which implies direct coupling between CDW and a collective spin&#8208;excitation. It is further shown that the CDW creates a robust idealized nonsymmorphic Dirac semimetal, thus providing access to topological systems with rich&#160;magnetism.

         <title>Single&#8208;Junction Organic Photovoltaic Cell with 19% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 41, October 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
By designing new donor/acceptor materials and combining a ternary blending strategy, a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.0% (certified value of 18.7%) in single&#8208;junction organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells is achieved. It is demonstrated that finely tuning the light utilization and photophysical processes of the active layer has great potential for further improving the PCEs of OPV cells.








Abstract
Improving power conversion efficiency (PCE) is important for broadening the applications of organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells. Here, a maximum PCE of 19.0% (certified value of 18.7%) is achieved in single&#8208;junction OPV cells by combining material design with a ternary blending strategy. An active layer comprising a new wide&#8208;bandgap polymer donor named PBQx&#8208;TF and a new low&#8208;bandgap non&#8208;fullerene acceptor (NFA) named eC9&#8208;2Cl is rationally designed. With optimized light utilization, the resulting binary cell exhibits a good PCE of 17.7%. An NFA F&#8208;BTA3 is then added to the active layer as a third component to simultaneously improve the photovoltaic parameters. The improved light unitization, cascaded energy level alignment, and enhanced intermolecular packing result in open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.879&#160;V, short&#8208;circuit current density of 26.7&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, and fill factor of 0.809. This study demonstrates that further improvement of PCEs of high&#8208;performance OPV cells requires fine tuning of the electronic structures and morphologies of the active layers.

         <title>Enhanced Thermopower of Saturated Molecules by Noncovalent Anchor&#8208;Induced Electron Doping of Single&#8208;Layer Graphene Electrode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 41, October 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Saturated molecules are not preferred in the research of organic thermoelectrics because of intrinsically wide bandgaps and poor thermopower. Graphene electrodes are demonstrated to be able to enhance thermopower of monolayers of saturated compounds. A noncovalent amine anchor induces the creation of in&#8208;gap states and n&#8208;type doping of graphene, thereby leading to an increased Seebeck coefficient relative to analogous covalent gold&#8211;thiolate monolayers.








Abstract
Enhancing thermopower is a key goal in organic and molecular thermoelectrics. Herein, it is shown that introducing noncovalent contact with a single&#8208;layer graphene (SLG) electrode improves the thermopower of saturated molecules as compared to the traditional gold&#8211;thiolate covalent contact. Thermoelectric junction measurements with a liquid&#8208;metal technique reveal that the value of Seebeck coefficient in large&#8208;area junctions based on n&#8208;alkylamine self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) on SLG is increased up to fivefold compared to the analogous junction based on n&#8208;alkanethiolate SAMs on gold. Experiments with Raman spectroscopy and field&#8208;effect transistor analysis indicate that such enhancements benefit from the creation of new in&#8208;gap states and electron doping through noncovalent interaction between the amine anchor and the SLG electrode, which leads to a reduced energy offset between the Fermi level and the transport channel. This work demonstrates that control of interfacial bonding nature in molecular junctions improves the Seebeck effect in saturated molecules.

         <title>2D Ti3C2Tx MXenes: Visible Black but Infrared White Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 41, October 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultralow infrared emissivity of the 2D Ti3C2Tx MXene is experimentally demonstrated. First&#8208;principles calculations confirm this discovery and reveal other MXenes such as Ti2CTx, Nb2CTx, and V2CTx are also low&#8208;emissivity materials. Such intrinsically visible black but infrared white materials that are rare in nature show great potential in solar&#8211;thermal conversion, multispectral camouflage, thermal insulation, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications.








Abstract
Black inorganic materials with low infrared absorption/emission (or IR white) are rare in nature but highly desired in numerous areas, such as solar&#8211;thermal energy harvesting, multispectral camouflage, thermal insulation, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. Due to the lack of spectral selectivity in intrinsic materials, such counter&#8208;intuitive properties are generally realized by constructing complicated subwavelength metamaterials with costly nanofabrication techniques. Here, the intrinsically low mid&#8208;IR emissivity (down to 10%) of the 2D Ti3C2Tx MXene is reported. Associated with a high solar absorptance (up to 90%), it embraces the best spectral selectivity among the reported intrinsic black solar&#8208;absorbing materials. Its appealing potential in several of the aforementioned areas is experimentally demonstrated. First&#8208;principles calculations reveal that the IR emissivity of MXene relies on both the nanoflake orientations and terminal groups, indicating great tunability. The calculations also suggest more potential low&#8208;emissivity MXenes including Ti2CTx, Nb2CTx, and V2CTx. This work opens the avenue to further exploration of a family of intrinsically low&#8208;emissivity materials with over 70 members.

         <title>Supersaturation&#8208;Controlled Growth of Monolithically Integrated Lead&#8208;Free Halide Perovskite Single&#8208;Crystalline Thin Film for High&#8208;Sensitivity Photodetectors</title>

A lead&#8208;free halide perovskite Cs3Bi2I9 single&#8208;crystalline thin film, with adjustable thickness and millimeter size, is directly integrated on various substrates including Si wafer, through a supersaturation&#8208;controlled method. Benefiting from the incommensurate lattice match and suitable thinness, this silicon&#8208;compatible perovskite photodetector is superior to most reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art lead&#8208;free halide perovskite photodetectors.








Abstract
Monolithical integration of the promising optoelectronic material with mature and inexpensive silicon circuitry contributes to simplifying device geometry, enhancing performance, and expanding new functionalities. Herein, a lead&#8208;free halide perovskite Cs3Bi2I9 single&#8208;crystalline thin film (SCTF), with thickness ranging from 900&#160;nm to 4.1&#160;&#181;m and aspect ratio up to 1666, is directly integrated on various substrates including Si wafer, through a facile and low&#8208;temperature solution&#8208;processing method. The growth kinetics of the lead&#8208;free halide perovskite SCTF are elucidated by in situ observation, and the solution supersaturation is controlled to reduce the inverse&#8208;temperature crystallization nucleation density and elongate the evaporation growth. The excellent lattice match and band alignment between Si(111) and Cs3Bi2I9(001) facets promote photogenerated charge dissociation and extraction, resulting in boosting the photoelectric sensitivity by 10&#8211;200 times compared with photodetectors based on other substrates. More importantly, this silicon&#8208;compatible perovskite SCTF photodetector exhibits a high switching ratio of 3000 and a fast response of 1.5 &#181;s, which are higher than most reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art lead&#8208;free halide perovskite photodetectors. This work not only gives an in&#8208;depth understanding of the perovskite precursor solution chemistry, but also demonstrates the great potential of monolithical integration of lead&#8208;free halide perovskite SCTF with a silicon wafer for high&#8208;performance photodetectors.

         <title>Exceptionally Robust Face&#8208;Sharing Motifs Enable Efficient and Durable Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 41, October 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 1D 5H&#8208;polytype Ba5Bi0.25Co3.75FeO14&#8722;&#948; oxide with high&#8208;valence face&#8208;sharing motifs is developed as a highly efficient and stable electrocatalyst for oxygen&#8208;evolving reaction. This exceptional face&#8208;sharing structure can be maintained even under high anodic potentials and accelerates the deprotonation step (*OOH&#160;+&#160;OH&#8722;&#160;=&#160;*OO&#160;+&#160;H2O&#160;+&#160;e&#8722;) via a steric inductive effect to promote lattice&#8208;oxygen participation.








Abstract
Corner&#8208;sharing oxides usually suffer from structural reconstruction during the bottleneck oxygen&#8208;evolution reaction (OER) in water electrolysis. Therefore, introducing dynamically stable active sites in an alternative structure is urgent but challenging. Here, 1D 5H&#8208;polytype Ba5Bi0.25Co3.75FeO14&#8722;&#948; oxide with face&#8208;sharing motifs is identified as a highly active and stable candidate for alkaline OER. Benefiting from the stable face&#8208;sharing motifs with three couples of combined bonds, Ba5Bi0.25Co3.75FeO14&#8722;&#948; can maintain its local structures even under high OER potentials as evidenced by fast operando spectroscopy, contributing to a negligible performance degradation over 110&#160;h. Besides, the higher Co valence and smaller orbital bandgap in Ba5Bi0.25Co3.75FeO14&#8722;&#948; endow it with a much better electron transport ability than its corner&#8208;sharing counterpart, leading to a distinctly reduced overpotential of 308&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in 0.1&#160;m KOH. Further mechanism studies show that the short distance between lattice&#8208;oxygen sites in face&#8208;sharing Ba5Bi0.25Co3.75FeO14&#8722;&#948; can accelerate the deprotonation step (*OOH&#160;+&#160;OH&#8722;&#160;=&#160;*OO&#160;+&#160;H2O&#160;+&#160;e&#8722;) via a steric inductive effect to promote lattice&#8208;oxygen participation. In this work, not only is a new 1D face&#8208;sharing oxide with impressive OER performance discovered, but also a rational design of dynamic stable and active sites for sustainable energy systems is inaugurated.

         <title>Passivation of the Buried Interface via Preferential Crystallization of 2D Perovskite on Metal Oxide Transport Layers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 41, October 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interfacial nonradiative recombination limits the open&#8208;circuit voltage of perovskite solar cells. A buried interface passivation strategy is developed that can be used across metal oxide transport layers. Perovskite precursors containing large organic cations with high affinity for the substrate spontaneously form a 2D passivation layer on the underlying metal oxides, which reduces interfacial recombination by 72%.








Abstract
The open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) of perovskite solar cells is limited by non&#8208;radiative recombination at perovskite/carrier transport layer (CTL) interfaces. 2D perovskite post&#8208;treatments offer a means to passivate the top interface; whereas, accessing and passivating the buried interface underneath the perovskite film requires new material synthesis strategies. It is posited that perovskite ink containing species that bind strongly to substrates can spontaneously form a passivating layer with the bottom CTL. The concept using organic spacer cations with rich &#63743;NH2 groups is implemented, where readily available hydrogens have large binding affinity to under&#8208;coordinated oxygens on the metal oxide substrate surface, inducing preferential crystallization of a thin 2D layer at the buried interface. The passivation effect of this 2D layer is examined using steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy: the 2D interlayer suppresses non&#8208;radiative recombination at the buried perovskite/CTL interface, leading to a 72% reduction in surface recombination velocity. This strategy enables a 65&#160;mV increase in Voc for NiOx based p&#8211;i&#8211;n devices, and a 100&#160;mV increase in Voc for SnO2&#8208;based n&#8211;i&#8211;p devices. Inverted solar cells with 20.1% power conversion efficiency (PCE) for 1.70&#160;eV and 22.9% PCE for 1.55&#160;eV bandgap perovskites are demonstrated.

Strain&#8208;Gated Switching
Mechanical&#8208;strain&#8208;gated electric switches play a key role in sensing, soft robotics, and stretchable electronics. They typically operate with an &#8220;off&#8208;switch&#8221; function, and exhibit a decrease in conductivity upon an applied strain. In article number 2104769, Soosang Chae, Andreas Fery, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate a thin&#8208;film architecture that features the inverse behavior: &#8220;on&#8208;switch&#8221;: a strain&#8208;induced transition from insulating to metallic conductivity, spanning nine orders of magnitude in conductivity.

Self&#8208;Healing Devices
An innovative concept of a self&#8208;healed electrode&#8208;channel system employing ultrathin metallic copper monosulfide (CuS) and monolayered molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is demonstrated by  John Hong, SeungNam Cha, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2102091 for the design of defect&#8208;curable transistors and phototransistors. Excess sulfur adatoms from the CuS electrode spontaneously heal the defect sites in the MoS2 channel for record&#8208;high transistor and phototransistor performance.

Perovskite Thin Films
In article number 2103010, Xiaosheng Fang and co&#8208;workers report a supersaturation&#8208;controlled growth method for growing lead&#8208;free halide perovskite single&#8208;crystalline thin film on target substrates to realize facile monolithical integration. The sufficient thinness and incommensurate lattice matching contribute to high&#8208;sensitivity silicon&#8208;compatible photodetectors, better than advanced lead&#8208;free halide perovskite optoelectronic devices.

Strain Sensors
In article number 2102488, Weiwei Wu, Hossam Haick, and co&#8208;workers describe covalent grafting of polyaniline onto stretchable elastomer nanomeshes to obtain free&#8208;standing and highly permeable ultrathin strain sensors that can be directly laminated onto the dynamic human skin for long periods of time. The reported device produces intimate connection with objects and can be used for the continuous interrogation of complex movements, mimicking muscle activities, and resembling brain activity.

         <title>Anchoring Sites Engineering in Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Highly Efficient Electrochemical Energy Conversion Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 41, October 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with isolated metal atoms stabilized on various supports by surrounding atoms have emerged as a new frontier. The atomic structure and composition of anchoring sites significantly influence the catalytic performance of SACs. An overview of  the correlation between the property of anchoring points and catalytic performance to guide the design of SACs is provided.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have been at the frontier of research field in catalysis owing to the maximized atomic utilization, unique structures and properties. The atomically dispersed and catalytically active metal atoms are necessarily anchored by surrounding atoms. As such, the structure and composition of anchoring sites significantly influence the catalytic performance of SACs even with the same metal element. Significant progress has been made to understand structure&#8211;activity relationships at an atomic level, but in&#8208;depth understanding in precisely designing highly efficient SACs for the targeted reactions is still required. In this review, various anchoring sites in SACs are summarized and classified into five different types (doped heteroatoms, defect sites, surface atoms, metal sites, and cavity sites). Then, their impacts on catalytic performance are elucidated for electrochemical reactions based on their distance from the metal center (first coordination shell and beyond). Further, SACs anchored on two typical types of hosts, carbon&#8208; and metal&#8208;based materials, are highlighted, and the effects of anchoring points on achieving the desirable atomic structure, catalytic performance, and reaction pathways are elaborated. At last, insights and outlook to the SAC field based on current achievements and challenges are presented.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 41, October 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent developments of catalytic nitrogen fixation are presented, digging deep into the atomic&#8208;scale insight of the reaction mechanism to clarify the ambiguity, listing powerful methods for enhancing the nitrogen fixation performance, and combining theory predictions with experimental results, all from a chemical bond perspective, which could facilitate deeper pondering and further  exploration in the nitrogen fixation field.








Abstract
Ammonia (NH3) and nitrates are essential for human society because of their widespread utilization for producing medicines, fibers, fertilizers, etc. In recent years, the development on nitrogen fixation under mild reaction conditions has attracted much attention. However, the very low conversion efficiency and ambiguous catalytic mechanism remain the major hurdles for the research of nitrogen fixation. This review aims to clarify the role of chemical bond in catalytic nitrogen fixation by summarizing and analyzing the recent development of nitrogen fixation research. In detail, the atomic&#8208;scale mechanism of nitrogen fixation reaction, the various methods to improve the nitrogen fixation performance, and the computational investigation of nitrogen fixation are discussed, all from a chemical bond perspective. It is hoped that this review could trigger more profound pondering and deeper exploration in the field of catalytic nitrogen fixation.

         <title>Physical Disruption of Solid Tumors by Immunostimulatory Microrobots Enhances Antitumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Micromotors coated with bacterial membrane are utilized for combinatorial cancer therapy. Upon intratumoral administration, the micromotors induce irreversible physical damage to the tumor tissue, while the immunostimulatory membrane recruits host immune cells to process tumor antigens in situ. Treatment of solid tumors using this platform results in robust antitumor immunity that can also control the growth of distant secondary tumors.








Abstract
The combination of immunotherapy with other forms of treatment is an emerging strategy for boosting antitumor responses. By combining multiple modes of action, these combinatorial therapies can improve clinical outcomes through unique synergisms. Here, a microrobot&#8208;based strategy that integrates tumor tissue disruption with biological stimulation is shown for cancer immunotherapy. The microrobot is fabricated by loading bacterial outer membrane vesicles onto a self&#8208;propelling micromotor, which can react with water to generate a propulsion force. When administered intratumorally to a solid tumor, the disruption of the local tumor tissue coupled with the delivery of an immunostimulatory payload leads to complete tumor regression. Additionally, treatment of the primary tumor results in the simultaneous education of the host immune system, enabling it to control the growth of distant tumors. Overall, this work introduces a distinct application of microrobots in cancer immunotherapy and offers an attractive strategy for amplifying cancer treatment efficacy when combined with conventional therapies.

         <title>Thermoplastic Elastomer Tunes Phase Structure and Promotes Stretchability of High&#8208;Efficiency Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strategy of introducing low&#8208;cost commercial thermoplastic elastomer in the active layer is put forward to address the long&#8208;standing challenge of mechanical properties improvement of organic solar cells. Meanwhile, the morphology and mechanical performance of ternary blend films are effectively modulated and characterized with advanced scattering and microscopic techniques. This approach is effective to many kinds of high&#8208;efficiency polymer:nonfullerene systems.








Abstract
Top&#8208;performance organic solar cells (OSCs) consisting of conjugated polymer donors and nonfullerene small molecule acceptors (NF&#8208;SMAs) deliver rapid increases in efficiencies. Nevertheless, many of the polymer donors exhibit high stiffness and small molecule acceptors are very brittle, which limit their applications in wearable devices. Here, a simple and effective strategy is reported to improve the stretchability and reduce the stiffness of high&#8208;efficiency polymer:NF&#8208;SMA blends and simultaneously maintain the high efficiency by incorporating a low&#8208;cost commercial thermoplastic elastomer, polystyrene&#8208;block&#8208;poly(ethylene&#8208;ran&#8208;butylene)&#8208;block&#8208;polystyrene (SEBS). The microstructure, mechanical properties, and photovoltaic performance of PM6:N3 with varied SEBS contents and the molecular weight dependence of SEBS on microstructure and mechanical properties are thoroughly characterized. This strategy for mechanical performance improvement exhibits excellent applicability in some other OSC blend systems, e.g., PBQx&#8208;TF:eC9&#8208;2Cl and PBDB&#8208;T:ITIC. More crucially, the elastic modulus of such complex ternary blends can be nicely predicted by a mechanical model. Therefore, incorporating thermoplastic elastomers is a widely applicable and cost&#8208;effective strategy to improve mechanical properties of nonfullerene OSCs and beyond.

         <title>Tuning the p&#8208;Orbital Electron Structure of s&#8208;Block Metal Ca Enables a High&#8208;Performance Electrocatalyst for Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalyst of s&#8208;block metal Ca&#8208;based single atom is realized by tuning the p&#8208;orbital electron structure of Ca active centers through coordinated N and O atoms, which exhibits excellent oxygen reduction reaction activity and durability, superior to a series of catalysts.








Abstract
Most previous efforts are devoted to developing transition metals as electrocatalysts guided by the d&#8208;band center model. The&#160;metals&#160;of&#160;the&#160;s&#8208;block&#160;of&#160;the&#160;periodic table have so far received little attention in the application of oxygen reduction reactions (ORR). Herein, a carbon catalyst with calcium (Ca) single atom coordinated with N and O is reported, which displays exceptional ORR activities in both acidic condition (E1/2&#160;= 0.77 V,&#160;0.1 m&#160;HClO4)&#160;and alkaline condition (E1/2&#160;= 0.90 V,&#160;0.1 m&#160;KOH).&#160;The Ca&#63743;N, O/C exhibits remarkable performance in zinc&#8211;air battery with a maximum power density of 218&#160;mW cm&#8211;2, superior to a series of catalysts reported so far. X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge structure (XANES) characterization confirms the formation of N&#8208; and O&#8208;atom&#8208;coordinated Ca in the carbon matrix. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the high catalytic activity of main&#8208;group Ca is ascribed to the fact that its p&#8208;orbital electron structure is regulated by N and O coordination so that the highest peak (EP) of the projected density of states (PDOS) for the Ca atom is moved close to the Fermi level, thereby facilitating the adsorption of ORR intermediates and electron transfer.

         <title>Realization of an Artificial Visual Nervous System using an Integrated Optoelectronic Device Array</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sol&#8211;gel&#8208;derived neurotransistors integrated with perovskite&#8208;based photodetectors are designed to serve as an artificial optoelectronic device array, which experimentally demonstrate the emulation of the dynamic adaptation process of the biological visual nervous system. The fundamental properties of biological adaptation, such as accuracy and desensitization behaviors, are characterized. These results enable postsynaptic responses to be manipulated to obtain external&#8208;environment&#8208;dependent encoded images.








Abstract
Human behavior (e.g., the response to any incoming information) has very complex forms and is based on the response to consecutive external stimuli entering varied sensory receptors. Sensory adaptation is an elementary form of the sensory nervous system known to filter out irrelevant information for efficient information transfer from consecutive stimuli. As bioinspired neuromorphic electronic system is developed, the functionality of organs shall be emulated at a higher level than the cell. Because it is important for electronic devices to possess sensory adaptation in spiking neural networks, the authors demonstrate a dynamic, real&#8208;time, photoadaptation process to optical irradiation when repeated light stimuli are presented to the artificial photoreceptor. The filtered electrical signal generated by the light and the adapting signal produces a specific range of postsynaptic states through the neurotransistor, demonstrating changes in the response according to the environment, as normally perceived by the human brain. This successfully demonstrates plausible biological sensory adaptation. Further, the ability of this circuit design to accommodate changes in the intensity of bright or dark light by adjusting the sensitivity of the artificial photoreceptor is demonstrated. Thus, the proposed artificial photoreceptor circuits have the potential to advance neuromorphic device technology by providing sensory adaptation capabilities.

         <title>Predictably Engineering the Viscoelastic Behavior of Dynamic Hydrogels via Correlation with Molecular Parameters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular parameters of dynamic covalent hydrogels are independently varied to investigate their effects on the viscoelastic behavior of hydrogels. Universal correlations are identified to quantitatively predict the viscoelastic properties of dynamic hydrogels with different network topologies based on the exchange rate of crosslinks and the number of effective crosslinks per polymer chain.








Abstract
Rational design of dynamic hydrogels with desirable viscoelastic behaviors relies on an in&#8208;depth understanding of the principles correlating molecular parameters and macroscopic properties. To quantitatively elucidate such principles, a series of dynamic covalent hydrogels crosslinked via hydrazone bonds is designed. The exchange rate of the hydrazone bond is tuned by varying the concentration of an organic catalyst, while maintaining the crosslinking density unchanged. This strategy of independently tuning exchange dynamics of crosslinks and crosslinking density allows unambiguous analysis of the viscoelastic response of the dynamic hydrogels as a function of their network parameters. It is found that the terminal relaxation time of the dynamic hydrogels is primarily determined by two factors: the exchange rate of crosslinks and the number of effective crosslinks per polymer chain, and is independent of the network architecture. Furthermore, a universal correlation is identified between the terminal relaxation time determined from stress relaxation and the exchange rate determined via reaction kinetics, which can be generalized to any viscoelastic hydrogel network, in principle. This quantitative correlation facilitates the development of dynamic hydrogels with a variable desired viscoelastic response based on molecular design.

         <title>Vertically Stacked Full Color Quantum Dots Phototransistor Arrays for High&#8208;Resolution and Enhanced Color&#8208;Selective Imaging</title>

Abstract
Color&#8208;selective multi&#8208;functional and multiplexed photodetectors have attracted considerable interest with the increasing demand for color filter free optoelectronics which can simultaneously process multispectral signal via minimized system complexity. The low efficiency of color&#8208;filter technology and conventional laterally pixelated photodetector array structures often limit opportunities for widespread realization of high&#8208;density photodetectors. Here, we develop low&#8208;temperature solution&#8208;processed vertically stacked full color quantum dot (QD) phototransistor arrays on plastic substrates for high&#8208;resolution color&#8208;selective photosensor applications. Particularly, the three different&#8208;sized/color (RGB) QDs were vertically stacked and pixelated via direct photo&#8208;patterning using a unique chelating chalcometallate ligand functioning both as solubilizing component and, after photoexposure, a semiconducting cement creating robust, insoluble, and charge&#8208;efficient QD layers localized in the a&#8208;IGZO transistor region, resulting in efficient wavelength&#8208;dependent photo&#8208;induced charge transfer. Thus, high&#8208;resolution vertically stacked full color QD photodetector arrays were successfully implemented with the density of 5,500 devices cm&#8211;2 on ultrathin flexible polymeric substrates with highly photosensitive characteristics such as photoresponsivity (1.1&#215;104 AW&#8211;1) and photodetectivity (1.1&#215;1018 Jones) as well as wide dynamic&#8208;ranges (&gt; 150&#160;dB).

         <title>Uncommon Behavior of Li Doping Suppresses Oxygen Redox in P2&#8208;type Manganese&#8208;Rich Sodium Cathodes</title>

Abstract
Utilizing both cationic and anionic oxygen redox reactions is regarded as an important approach to exploit high&#8208;capacity layered cathode materials with earth abundant elements. It has been popular strategies to effectively elevate the oxygen redox activities by Li&#8208;doping to introduce unhybridized O 2p orbitals in NaxMnO2&#8208;based chemistries or enabling high covalency transition metals in P2&#8208;Na0.66MnxTM1&#8208;xO2 (TM = Fe, Cu, Ni) materials. Here, we investigated the effect of Li doping on regulating the oxygen redox activities P2&#8208;structured Na0.66Ni0.25Mn0.75O2 materials. Systematic X&#8208;ray characterizations and ab initio simulations have shown that the doped Li has uncommon behavior in modulating the density of states of the neighboring Ni, Mn and O, leading to the suppression of the existing oxygen and Mn redox reactivities and the promotion of the Ni redox. The findings provide a complementary scenario to current oxygen redox mechanisms and shed lights on developing new routes for high&#8208;performance cathodes.

         <title>Deterministic Shallow Dopant Implantation in Silicon with Detection Confidence Upper&#8208;Bound to 99.85% by Ion&#8208;Solid Interactions</title>

Abstract
Silicon chips containing arrays of single dopant atoms could be the material of choice for both classical and quantum devices that exploit single donor spins. For example, group&#8208;V&#8208;donors implanted in isotopically purified 28Si crystals are attractive for large&#8208;scale quantum computers. Useful attributes include long nuclear and electron spin lifetimes of 31P, hyperfine clock transitions in 209Bi or electrically controllable 123Sb nuclear spins. Promising architectures require the ability to fabricate arrays of individual near&#8208;surface dopant atoms with high yield. Here we employ an on&#8208;chip detector electrode system with 70&#160;eV r.m.s. noise (&#8764;20 electrons) to demonstrate near room temperature implantation of single 14&#160;keV 31P+ ions. The physics model for the ion&#8208;solid interaction shows an unprecedented upper&#8208;bound single ion detection confidence of 99.85&#177;0.02% for near&#8208;surface implants. As a result, the practical controlled silicon doping yield is limited by materials engineering factors including surface gate oxides in which detected ions may stop. For a device with 6&#160;nm gate oxide and 14&#160;keV 31P+ implants we demonstrate a yield limit of 98.1%. Thinner gate oxides allow this limit to converge to the upper&#8208;bound. Deterministic single ion implantation can therefore be a viable materials engineering strategy for scalable dopant architectures in silicon&#160;devices.

         <title>A novel porous Ti&#8208;squarate as efficient photocatalyst in the overall water splitting reaction under simulated sunlight irradiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
A new porous titanium(IV) squarate metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF), denoted as IEF&#8208;11, having a never reported titanium secondary building unit has been successfully synthesized and fully characterized. IEF&#8208;11 not only exhibits a permanent porosity, but also an outstanding chemical stability. Further, as a consequence of combining the photoactive Ti(IV) and the electroactive squarate, IEF&#8208;11 presents relevant optoelectronic properties, applied here to the photocatalytic overall water splitting reaction. Remarkably, IEF&#8208;11 as a photocatalyst is able to produce record H2 amounts for MOF&#8208;based materials under simulated sunlight (up to 672 &#956;mol&#183;gcatalyst in 22 h) without any activity loss during at least 10 days.

         <title>Highly Selective and Sensitive Detection of Volatile Sulfur Compounds by Ionically Conductive Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
High selectivity to specific analyte is essential for chemical sensors but difficult to achieve. For most chemical sensors, although the response to the target analyte can be more significant than interference analytes, they still show obvious responses to the interference analytes. Here we develop highly selective chemical sensors with negligible responses to other interference vapors. Instead of the widely investigated electronically conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (EC&#8208;MOFs), ionically conductive MOFs (IC&#8208;MOFs) are used as the sensing materials, and the unique interaction between the ion charge carrier and the analyte is utilized to achieve high sensing selectivity. Through the modulation of the metal nodes (Cu, Co, Ni, Zn, Mg) and organic ligands (H2TCPP, H2THPP, H4BTEC), sensor arrays based on a set of IC&#8208;MOF are fabricated and achieve highly selective detection toward volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs). H2S and CH3SH can be selectively detected at concentrations down to 1 ppb and 1&#160;ppm, respectively. The facile preparation and low cost endow the device with disposability. These results suggest new approaches for the development of highly selective chemical sensors.

         <title>Strain&#8208;enabled Phase Transition of Periodic Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Phase transitions are universal in solid&#8208;state matters, as well as in periodic electromagnetic metasurfaces &#8211; the photonic analogues of crystals. Although such transitions dictate the properties of active metasurfaces, universal ways to describe the structure transition of periodic metasurfaces have not yet been established. Here, we report the strain&#8208;enable phase transition (or lattice deformation) of stretchable metasurfaces with the crystallographic description. We analytically and experimentally demonstrate the phase transition of plasmonic lattices between two arbitrary two&#8208;dimensional (2D) Bravais lattices under certain strain configurations. The strain&#8208;induced symmetry lowering of the structures gives rise to optical anisotropy upon polarization, namely, linearly and circularly polarized dichroism. We further demonstrate the potential of phase transition in information decoding with applied strain. Interpreting the phase transition of metesurfaces from a standpoint of symmetry would accelerate the discovery of emergent properties, and provide a generalizable approach to designing active metasurfaces.

         <title>Amine Functionalized Carbon Nanodots Electrocatalysts Converting Carbon Dioxide to Methane</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The electrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) to methane (CH4), which can be used not only as fuel but also as a hydrogen carrier, has drawn great attention for use in supporting carbon capture and utilization. The design of active and selective electrocatalysts with exceptional CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion efficiency is highly desirable; however, it remains a challenge. Here we present a molecular tuning strategy&#8722;in&#8208;situ amine functionalization of nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene quantum dots (GQDs) for highly efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion. Amine functionalized nitrogen&#8208;doped GQDs achieve a CH4 Faradic efficiency (FE) of 63% and 46%, respectively, at CH4 partial current densities of 170 and 258&#160;mA cm&#8211;2, approximating to or even outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Cu&#8208;based catalysts. These GQDs also convert CO2 to C2 products mainly including C2H4 and C2H5OH with a maximum FE of &#8764;10%. A systematic analysis reveals that the CH4 yield varies linearly with amine group content, whereas the C2 production rate is positively dependent on pyridinic N dopant content. This work provides insight into the rational design of carbon catalysts with CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion efficiency at the industrially relevant level.

Abstract
Collective optoelectronic phenomena such as plasmons and phonon polaritons can drive processes in many branches of nanoscale science. Classical physics predicts that a perfect thermal emitter operates at the black body limit. Numerous experiments have shown that surface phonon polaritons allow emission two orders of magnitude above the limit at a gap distance of &#8764; 50&#160;nm. This work shows that a supported multilayer graphene structure improves the state of the art by around one order of magnitude with a &#8764; 1129 fold&#8208;enhancement at a gap distance of &#8764; 55&#160;nm. Coupled surface plasmon polaritons at mid&#8208; and far&#8208;infrared frequencies allow for near&#8208;unity photon tunneling across a broad swath of k&#8208;space enabling the improved result. Electric tuning of the Fermi&#8208;level allows for the detailed characterization and optimization of the colossal nanoscale heat transfer.

         <title>Stretchable Soft Composites with strain&#8208;induced Architectured Color</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Colors enable interaction and communication between living species in a myriad of biological and artificial environments. While living organisms feature low&#8208;power mechanisms to dynamically control color in soft tissues, man&#8208;made color&#8208;changing devices remain predominantly rigid and energy&#8208;intensive. Here, we report soft architectured composites that display striking color changes when stretched in selective directions under ambient light with minimum power input. The orientation&#8208;dependent color change results from the rotation of reflective coated platelets that are embedded in a soft polymer matrix and pre&#8208;aligned in a well&#8208;defined architecture. The light reflected by the platelets generates structural color defined by the oxide coating on the platelet surface. By magnetically programming the initial orientation and spatial distribution of selected platelets within the soft matrix, we create composites with strain&#8208;modulated color&#8208;changing effects that cannot be achieved using state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art technologies. The proposed concept of strain&#8208;induced architectured color can be harnessed to develop low&#8208;power smart stretchable displays, tactile synthetic skins and autonomous soft robotic devices that undergo fast and reversible color changes through the mechano&#8208;optic coupling programmed within their soft composite architecture.

         <title>Interface&#8208;mediated Twinning&#8208;induced Plasticity in A Fine Hexagonal Microstructure Generated By Additive Manufacturing

Abstract
The grain size is a determinant microstructural feature to enable the activation of deformation twinning in hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp) metals. Although deformation twinning is one of the most effective mechanisms for improving the strength&#8208;ductility trade&#8208;off of structural alloys, its activation is reduced with decreasing grain size. This work reports the discovery of the activation of deformation twinning in a fine&#8208;grained hcp microstructure by introducing ductile body&#8208;centered cubic (bcc) nano&#8208;layer interfaces. The fast solidification and cooling conditions of laser&#8208;based additive manufacturing are exploited to obtain a fine microstructure that, coupled with an intensified intrinsic heat treatment, permits to generate the bcc nano&#8208;layers. In situ high&#8208;energy synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction allows tracking the activation and evolution of mechanical twinning in real&#8208;time. The findings obtained show the potential of ductile nano&#8208;layering for the novel design of hcp damage tolerant materials with improved life spans.

         <title>Green Recycling Methods to Treat Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries E&#8208;Waste: A Circular Approach to Sustainability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Emerging green recycling processes for spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) are covered here, including bioleaching, waste&#8208;for&#8208;waste, and electrochemical methods that employ environmentally friendly sustainable technologies. It also highlights methods to regenerate recovered elements from spent LIB. The circular economy approach toward closed&#8208;loop LIB recycling is elaborated through approaches to reprocess recovered elements into electrodes and reusing them to fabricate new LIBs.








Abstract
E&#8208;waste generated from end&#8208;of&#8208;life spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) is increasing at a rapid rate owing to the increasing consumption of these batteries in portable electronics, electric vehicles, and renewable energy storage worldwide. On the one hand, landfilling and incinerating LIBs e&#8208;waste poses environmental and safety concerns owing to their constituent materials. On the other hand, scarcity of metal resources used in manufacturing LIBs and potential value creation through the recovery of these metal resources from spent LIBs has triggered increased interest in recycling spent LIBs from e&#8208;waste. State of the art recycling of spent LIBs involving pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy processes generates considerable unwanted environmental concerns. Hence, alternative innovative approaches toward the green recycling process of spent LIBs are essential to tackle large volumes of spent LIBs in an environmentally friendly way. Such evolving techniques for spent LIBs recycling based on green approaches, including bioleaching, waste for waste approach, and electrodeposition, are discussed here. Furthermore, the ways to regenerate strategic metals post leaching, efficiently reprocess extracted high&#8208;value materials, and reuse them in applications including electrode materials for new LIBs. The concept of &#8220;circular economy&#8221; is highlighted through closed&#8208;loop recycling of spent LIBs achieved through green&#8208;sustainable approaches.

         <title>Intracellular Condensates of Oligopeptide for Targeting Lysosome and Addressing Multiple Drug Resistance of Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lysosome selective construction of biomolecular hydrogel with emerging biological functions provides a novel strategy for controlling cancer cell fates by inducing lysosomal&#8208;membrane permeabilization and addressing multidrug resistance in a tumor&#8208;bearing mouse model.








Abstract
Biomolecular condensates have been demonstrated as a ubiquitous phenomenon in biological systems and play a crucial role in controlling cellular functions. However, the spatiotemporal construction of artificial biomolecular condensates with functions remains challenging and has been less explored. Herein, a general approach is reported to construct biomolecular condensates (e.g., hydrogel) in the lysosome of living cells for cancer therapy and address multiple drug resistance induced by lysosome sequestration. Aromatic&#8208;motif&#8208;appended pH&#8208;responsive hexapeptide (LTP) derived from natural insulin can be uptaken by cancer cells mainly through caveolae&#8208;dependent endocytosis, ensuring the proton&#8208;triggered phase transformation (solution to hydrogel) of LTP inside the lysosome specifically. Lysosomal hydrogelation further leads to enlargement of the lysosome in cancer cells and increases the permeability of the lysosome, resulting in cancer cell death. Importantly, lysosomal assemblies can significantly improve the efficiency of current chemotherapy drugs toward multidrug resistance (MDR) cells in vitro and in xenograft tumor models. As an example of functional artificial condensates in lysosomes, this work provides a new strategy for controlling functional condensates formation precisely in the organelles of living cells and addressing MDR in cancer therapy.

         <title>Self&#8208;Supporting 3D Carbon Nitride with Tunable n &#8594; &#960;* Electronic Transition for Enhanced Solar Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;supporting 3D (SSD) polymeric carbon nitride (PCN), with tunable n &#8594; &#960;* electronic transition, is successfully synthesized via a facile stepwise pyrolytic strategy. The synergistic optimization of the SSD structure and n &#8594; &#960;* electronic transition in PCN significantly advance the exciton dissociation and optical absorption, leading to enhanced visible&#8208;light H2 evolution activity in the spectral region above 500&#160;nm.








Abstract
Self&#8208;supporting 3D (SSD) carbon nitrides (UCN&#8208;X, X&#160;= 600&#8211;690; where X represents the pyrolytic temperature) consisting of curved layers, with plenty of wrinkles and enlarged size, are synthesized via a facile stepwise pyrolytic strategy. Such unique features of the SSD structure exhibiting dramatically improved charge mobility, extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated aromatic system, and partial distortion of heptazine&#8208;based skeleton can not only keep the easier activation of the intrinsic &#960;&#160;&#8594; &#160;&#960;* electronic transition but also awaken the n &#8594; &#960;* electronic transition in carbon nitride. The n &#8594; &#960;* electronic transition of UCN&#8208;X can be controllably tuned through changing the pyrolytic temperature, which can greatly extend the photoresponse range to 600&#160;nm. More importantly, the change regularity of H2 evolution rates is highly positive, correlated with the change tendency of n &#8594; &#960;* electronic transition in UCN&#8208;X, suggesting the positive contribution of n &#8594; &#960;* electronic transition to enhancing photocatalytic activity. The UCN&#8208;670, with optimal structural and optical properties, presents enhanced H2 evolution rate up to 9230&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 (Pt 1.1 wt%). This work realizes the synergistic optimization of optical absorption and exciton dissociation via fabricating an SSD structure. It offers a new strategy for the development of novel carbon nitride materials for efficient photocatalytic reactions.

The synergistic optimization of the SSD structure and n &#8594; &#960;* electronic transition in PCN significantly advance the exciton dissociation and optical absorption, leading to enhanced visible-light H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution activity in the spectral region above 500&#160;nm.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-supporting 3D (SSD) carbon nitrides (UCN-&lt;i&gt;X, X&lt;/i&gt;&#160;&lt;b&gt;=&lt;/b&gt; 600&#8211;690; where &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt; represents the pyrolytic temperature) consisting of curved layers, with plenty of wrinkles and enlarged size, are synthesized via a facile stepwise pyrolytic strategy. Such unique features of the SSD structure exhibiting dramatically improved charge mobility, extended &#960;-conjugated aromatic system, and partial distortion of heptazine-based skeleton can not only keep the easier activation of the intrinsic &#960;&#160;&lt;b&gt;&#8594;&lt;/b&gt; &#160;&#960;* electronic transition but also awaken the n &lt;b&gt;&#8594;&lt;/b&gt; &#960;* electronic transition in carbon nitride. The n &lt;b&gt;&#8594;&lt;/b&gt; &#960;* electronic transition of UCN-&lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt; can be controllably tuned through changing the pyrolytic temperature, which can greatly extend the photoresponse range to 600&#160;nm. More importantly, the change regularity of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution rates is highly positive, correlated with the change tendency of n &lt;b&gt;&#8594;&lt;/b&gt; &#960;* electronic transition in UCN-&lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;, suggesting the positive contribution of n &lt;b&gt;&#8594;&lt;/b&gt; &#960;* electronic transition to enhancing photocatalytic activity. The UCN-670, with optimal structural and optical properties, presents enhanced H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution rate up to 9230&#160;&#181;mol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (Pt 1.1 wt%). This work realizes the synergistic optimization of optical absorption and exciton dissociation via fabricating an SSD structure. It offers a new strategy for the development of novel carbon nitride materials for efficient photocatalytic reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Elastomeric Nanodielectrics for Soft and Hysteresis&#8208;Free Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Elastomeric nanodielectrics are fabricated by the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly of oppositely charged polyurethanes in aqueous solutions, showing high area capacitances, low leakage currents, high humidity immunity, and low densities of charge traps. These robust nanodielectrics are demonstrated in stretchable capacitors and flexible low&#8208;voltage and hysteresis&#8208;free field&#8208;effect transistors with uniform performance and fatigue resistance.








Abstract
Elastomeric dielectrics are crucial for reliably governing the carrier densities in semiconducting channels during deformation in soft/stretchable field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs). Uncontrolled stacking of polymeric chains renders elastomeric dielectrics poorly insulated at nanoscale thicknesses, thereby thick films are usually required, leading to high voltage or power consumption for on/off operations of FETs. Here, layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly is exploited to build 15&#8208;nm&#8208;thick elastomeric nanodielectrics through alternative adsorption of oppositely charged polyurethanes (PUs) for soft and hysteresis&#8208;free FETs. After mild thermal annealing to heal pinholes, such PU multilayers offer high areal capacitances of 237&#160;nF cm&#8722;2 and low leakage current densities of 3.2 &#215; 10&#8722;8 A cm&#8722;2 at 2&#160;V. Owing to the intrinsic ductility of the elastomeric PUs, the nanofilms possess excellent dielectric properties at a strain of 5% or a bending radius of 1.5&#160;mm, while the wrinkled counterparts show mechanical stability with negligible changes of leakage currents after repeated stretching to a strain of 50%. Besides, these nanodielectrics are immune to high humidity and conserve their properties when immersed into water, despite their assembly occurs aqueously. Furthermore, the PU dielectrics are implemented in carbon nanotube FETs, demonstrating low&#8208;voltage operations (&lt; 1.5&#160;V) and negligible hysteresis without any encapsulations.

         <title>Unraveling Strain Gradient Induced Electromechanical Coupling in Twisted Double Bilayer Graphene Moir&#233; Superlattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intrinsic flexoelectricity in twisted double bilayer graphene moir&#233; superlattices is presented. First, threefold symmetric polarizations are predicated based on density function theory and finite element analysis. Then, strain gradient induced polarizations are captured by piezoelectric force microscopy at room temperature with superior resolution. Finally, the 180&#176; phase change is determined using vector analysis which matches well with theoretical predication.








Abstract
Moir&#233; superlattices of 2D materials with a small twist angle are thought to exhibit appreciable flexoelectric effect, though unambiguous confirmation of their flexoelectricity is challenging due to artifacts associated with commonly used piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM). For example, unexpectedly small phase contrast (&#8776;8&#176;) between opposite flexoelectric polarizations is reported in twisted bilayer graphene (tBG), though theoretically predicted value is 180&#176;. Here a methodology is developed to extract intrinsic moir&#233; flexoelectricity using twisted double bilayer graphene (tDBG) as a model system, probed by lateral PFM. For small twist angle samples, it is found that a vectorial decomposition is essential to recover the small intrinsic flexoelectric response at domain walls from a large background signal. The obtained threefold symmetry of commensurate domains with significant flexoelectric response at domain walls is fully consistent with the theoretical calculations. Incommensurate domains in tDBG with relatively large twist angles can also be observed by this technique. A general strategy is provided here for unraveling intrinsic flexoelectricity in van der Waals moir&#233; superlattices while providing insights into engineered symmetry breaking in centrosymmetric materials.

         <title>2D Molecular Sheets of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks for Ultrastable Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;dimensional molecular sheets of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks are prepared using diaminotriazole linkers to form multi&#8208;site hydrogen bonds. The product has excellent chemical stability and diminished solubility in common organic solvents, and can enable superstable sodium ion storage for 10,000 cycles.








Abstract
There has been growing research interest in hydrogen bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) by virtue of their great structural crystallinity, large surface areas and porosity. Their potential in electrochemical applications, unfortunately, remains elusive because weak hydrogen bonds would dissociate in solution that eventually compromises the structural integrity. Herein, it is demonstrated that this issue may be overcome by designing and introducing multisite hydrogen bonding within HOFs. 2D molecular sheets are prepared using diaminotriazole as the linkers for the first time. In spite of the molecular thickness (&#8776;1 nm), they are chemically stable and mechanically robust, and have diminished solubility in most polar or nonpolar organic solvents. This solution&#8208;stable HOF exhibits an excellent electrochemical performance for Na+ ion storage. In particular, it enables an exceptional cycle life of &gt;10&#160;000 cycles at 1 A g&#8208;1, which is far superior to most other organic electrode materials. Theoretical simulations indicate that the activation barrier for the intralayer or interlayer diffusion of Na+ ions within the organic frameworks is small.

Gradient alloyed CdSe/ZnxCd1&#8722;xS/ZnS and CdSe/CdS/ZnS core/shell/shell quantum&#8208;rod downconverters showing high&#8208;efficacy light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) covering a wide color gamut are reported. The engineered shell thickness suppresses energy transfer and Auger recombination and maintains the high quantum yield in the solid&#8208;state (81%). These LEDs show luminous efficacy of 149&#160;lm&#160;W&#8722;1 and wide color gamut.








Abstract
Efficient white light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) with an efficacy of 200&#160;lm&#160;W&#8722;1 are much desirable for lighting and displays. The phosphor&#8208;based LEDs in use today for display applications offer poor color saturation. Intensive efforts have been made to replace the phosphor with quantum&#8208;dot&#8208;based downconverters, but the efficiency and stability of these devices are still in their infancy. Quantum rods (QRs), nanoparticles with an elongated shape, show superior properties such as relatively larger Stokes shifts, polarized emission, and high light out&#8208;coupling efficiency in the solid&#8208;state. However, these QRs usually suffer from poor optical quality for PL wavelengths &lt;&#160;550&#160;nm. Herein, a gradient alloyed CdSe/ZnxCd1&#8722;xS/ZnS and CdSe/CdS/ZnS core/shell/shell QR downconverters showing high efficacy LEDs covering a wide color gamut are reported. These QRs show high stability and a precisely tunable photoluminescence peak. The engineered shell thickness suppresses energy transfer and thus maintains the high quantum yield in the solid&#8208;state (81%). These QR&#8208;based LEDs attain an efficacy of 149&#160;lm&#160;W&#8722;1 (@10mA) and&#160;wide color gamut (118% NTSC), which is exceedingly higher than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art quantum dots and phosphor&#8208;based on&#8208;chip LEDs.

&lt;/i&gt;S/ZnS and CdSe/CdS/ZnS core/shell/shell QR downconverters showing high efficacy LEDs covering a wide color gamut are reported. These QRs show high stability and a precisely tunable photoluminescence peak. The engineered shell thickness suppresses energy transfer and thus maintains the high quantum yield in the solid-state (81%). These QR-based LEDs attain an efficacy of 149&#160;lm&#160;W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (@10mA) and&#160;wide color gamut (118% NTSC), which is exceedingly higher than state-of-the-art quantum dots and phosphor-based on-chip LEDs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Quinoxaline&#8208;Based D&#8211;A Copolymers for the Applications as Polymer Donor and Hole Transport Material in Polymer/Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent developments of the quinoxaline&#8208;based D&#8211;A copolymers for the applications as polymer donor in polymer solar cells and as hole transport material in perovskite solar cells are reviewed.








Abstract
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have achieved great progress recently, benefiting from the rapid development of narrow bandgap small molecule acceptors and wide bandgap conjugated polymer donors. Among the polymer donors, the D&#8211;A copolymers with quinoxaline (Qx) as A&#8208;unit have received increasing attention since the report of the low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance D&#8211;A copolymer donor based on thiophene D&#8208;unit and difluoro&#8208;quinoxalline A&#8208;unit in 2018. In addition, the weak electron&#8208;deficient characteristic and the multiple substitution positions of the Qx unit make it an ideal A&#8208;unit in constructing the wide bandgap polymer donors with different functional substitutions. In this review article, recent developments of the Qx&#8208;based D&#8211;A copolymer donors, including synthetic method of the Qx unit, backbone modulation, side chain optimization, and functional substitution of the Qx&#8208;based D&#8211;A copolymers, are summarized and discussed. Furthermore, the application of the Qx&#8208;based D&#8211;A copolymers as hole transport material in perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs) is also introduced. The focus mainly on the molecular design strategies and structure&#8211;properties relationship of the Qx&#8208;based D&#8211;A copolymers, aiming to provide a guideline for developing high&#8208;performance Qx&#8208;based D&#8211;A copolymers for the applications as donor in PSCs and as hole transport material in pero&#8208;SCs.

         <title>Deep&#8208;Red Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Based on One&#8208;Step&#8208;Formed &#947;&#8208;CsPbI3 Cuboid Crystallites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile one&#8208;step method to in situ deposit &#947;&#8208;phase 3D CsPbI3 films consisting of cuboid crystallites is achieved by introducing 1,3&#8208;propanediamine dihydriodide (PDAI). The PDAI&#8208;perovskite light&#8208;emitting diode (PeLED) can reach a record efficiency of 15.03% for 3D CsPbI3 PeLEDs and a peak efficiency of 10.30% of a 9 cm2 PeLED.








Abstract
Inorganic CsPbI3 perovskite with high chemical stability is attractive for efficient deep&#8208;red perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) with high color purity. Compared to PeLEDs based on ex&#8208;situ&#8208;synthesized CsPbI3 nanocrystals/quantum dots suffering from low conductivity and efficiency droop under high current densities, in situ deposited 3D CsPbI3 films from precursor solutions can maintain high conductivity but show high trap density. Here, it is demonstrated that introducing diammonium iodide can increase the size of colloids in the precursor solution, retard the phase&#8208;transition rate, and passivate trap states of the in&#8208;situ&#8208;formed cuboid crystallites. The PeLED based on the one&#8208;step&#8208;formed 3D CsPbI3 cuboid crystallite films shows a peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) value up to 15.03% because of the high conductivity and reduced trap states. Furthermore, this one&#8208;step method also has a wide processing window, which is attractive for flow&#8208;line production of large&#8208;area PeLED modules. The fabrication of a 9 cm2 PeLED that exhibits a peak EQE of 10.30% is successfully demonstrated.

         <title>Microbially Catalyzed Biomaterials for Bone Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Urease&#8208;producing haloalkalophilic&#160;bacteria can be used as biocatalyst adhered to the surface of bioceramics to form a biomineral layer: urea as the substrate is converted to carbonate by bacterial catalysis, and the subsequently increased CO32&#8722; reacts with the Ca2+ existing around the bacterial cells, leading to the formation of micro/nanostructures on the biomaterials. The newly generated micro/nanostructures facilitated by bacteria promote bone&#8208;forming bioactivity.








Abstract
Bone is a complex mineralized tissue composed of various organic (proteins, cells) and inorganic (hydroxyapatite, calcium carbonate) substances with micro/nanoscale structures. To improve interfacial bioactivity of bone&#8208;implanted biomaterials, extensive efforts are being made to fabricate favorable biointerface via surface modification. Inspired by microbially catalyzed mineralization, a novel concept to biologically synthesize the micro/nanostructures on bioceramics, microbial&#8208;assisted catalysis, is presented. It involves three processes: bacterial adhesion on biomaterials, production of CO32&#8722; assisted by bacteria, and nucleation and growth of CaCO3 nanocrystals on the surface of bioceramics. The microbially catalyzed biominerals exhibit relatively uniform micro/nanostructures on the surface of both 2D and 3D &#945;&#8208;CaSiO3 bioceramics. The topographic and chemical cues of the grown micro/nanostructures present excellent in vitro and in vivo bone&#8208;forming bioactivity. The underlying mechanism is closely related to the activation of multiple biological processes associated with bone regeneration. The study offers a microbially catalytic concept and strategy of fabricating micro/nanostructured biomaterials for tissue regeneration.

         <title>A Bioinspired Adhesive&#8208;Integrated&#8208;Agent Strategy for Constructing Robust Gas&#8208;Sensing Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An adhesive&#8208;integrated&#8208;agent strategy enabled by integrating the adhesive unit with the gas&#8208;sensing unit into one chemistry entity for constructing ultra&#8208;robust gas sensors to essentially solve the challenge of sensor stability at the molecular level is proposed. The fabricated sensors possess extremely strong interfacial adhesion and efficient gas sensitivity for outputting stable and reliable sensing signals even under harsh conditions.








Abstract
Gas sensors based on organic molecules are attractive for their tailored molecular structures and controllable functions, but weak interfacial adhesion between sensing materials and supporting substrates has severely hampered their practical applications, particularly in harsh environments. Here, inspired by the combined anchoring&#8208;recognizing feature of natural olfactory systems, an adhesive&#8208;integrated&#8208;agent strategy to integrate the adhesive unit (poly(dimethylsiloxane)) with the sensing unit (organoplatinum(II)) into one chemistry entity, creating robust and sensitive nanobelt array gas sensors is demonstrated. Systematic theoretical and experimental studies reveal that incorporating adhesive units significantly enhances the interfacial adhesion of the array sensors and gas&#8208;bridged super&#8208;exchange electronic couplings of sensing units ensure their efficient gas&#8208;sensing performance. The high shear strength of &#8776;7.05 &#215; 106 N m&#8722;2 allows these arrays to resist aggressive ultrasonication, tape peeling, or repeated bending without compromising their sensing performance. This molecular engineering strategy opens a new guideline to develop robust gas sensors.

Ripples are strongly coupled with ferroic orders in 2D ferroics. Take monolayer ferroelectric&#8208;ferroelastic GeSe as an example, it is shown that rippling ferroic phase transition and domain switching can render ultrahigh piezoelectric performance over a broad temperature range in 2D materials. It provides valuable guidance for ripple engineering in 2D materials with potential applications in 2D flexible electronics.








Abstract
Ripples are a class of native structural defects widely existing in 2D materials. They originate from the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane flexibility of 2D materials introducing spatially evolving electronic structure and friction behavior. However, the effect of ripples on 2D ferroics has not been reported. Here a molecular dynamics study of the effect of ripples on the temperature&#8208;induced ferroic phase transition and stress&#8208;induced ferroic domain switching in ferroelastic&#8208;ferroelectric monolayer GeSe is presented. Ripples stabilize the short&#8208;range ferroic orders in the high&#8208;temperature phase with stronger ferroicity and longer lifetime, thereby increasing the transition temperature upon cooling. In addition, ripples significantly affect the domain switching upon loading, changing it from a highly correlated process into a ripple&#8208;driven localized one where ripples act as source of dynamical random stress. These results reveal the fundamental role of ripples on 2D ferroicity and provide theoretical guidance for ripple engineering of controlled phase transition and domain switching with potential applications in flexible 2D electronics.

         <title>Utilizing the Built&#8208;in Electric Field of p&#8211;n Junctions to Spatially Propel the Stepwise Polysulfide Conversion in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel hierarchical and defect&#8208;rich Co3O4/TiO2 p&#8211;n junctions with built&#8208;in electric field are designed as the host materials of sulfur electrodes for Li&#8211;S batteries. The elaborate p&#8211;n junctions not only induce the directional migration of lithium polysulfides to suppress the dissolution of sulfur intermediates into the electrolyte but also implement the spatially sequential catalysis to ensure the superior utilization of sulfur.








Abstract
Integrating sulfur cathodes with effective catalysts to accelerate polysulfide conversion is a suitable way for overcoming the serious shuttling and sluggish conversion of polysulfides in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. However, because of the sharp differences in the redox reaction kinetics and complicated phase transformation of sulfur, a single&#8208;component catalyst cannot consistently accelerate the entire redox process. Herein, hierarchical and defect&#8208;rich Co3O4/TiO2 p&#8211;n junctions (p&#8208;Co3O4/n&#8208;TiO2&#8208;HPs) are fabricated to implement the sequential catalysis of S8(solid)&#160;&#8594; Li2S4(liquid)&#160;&#8594; Li2S(solid). Co3O4 sheets physiochemically immobilize the pristine sulfur and ensure the rapid reduction of S8 to Li2S4, while TiO2 dots realize the effective precipitation of Li2S, bridged by the directional migration of polysulfides from p&#8208;type Co3O4 to n&#8208;type TiO2 attributed to the interfacial built&#8208;in electric field. As a result, the sulfur cathode coupled with p&#8208;Co3O4/n&#8208;TiO2&#8208;HPs delivers long&#8208;term cycling stability with a low capacity decay of 0.07% per cycle after 500 cycles at 10 C. This study demonstrates the synergistic effect of the built&#8208;in electric field and heterostructures in spatially enhancing the stepwise conversion of polysulfides, which provides novel insights into the interfacial architecture for rationally regulating the polysulfide redox reactions.

         <title>A Morphologically Stable Li/Electrolyte Interface for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries Enabled by 3D&#8208;Micropatterned Garnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Morphological degradation at the Li/solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) interface is a prevalent issue causing performance fading of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries. A novel 3D&#8208;micropatterned SSE that can stabilize the morphology of the Li/SSE interface under relatively high current density and limited stack pressure is reported. The stabilization is achieved by utilizing the synergistic effect of electrochemical and mechanical modifications at the Li/SSE interface.








Abstract
Morphological degradation at the Li/solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) interface is a prevalent issue causing performance fading of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs). To maintain the interfacial integrity, most ASSBs are operated under low current density with considerable stack pressure, which significantly limits their widespread usage. Herein, a novel 3D&#8208;micropatterned SSE (3D&#8208;SSE) that can stabilize the morphology of the Li/SSE interface even under relatively high current density and limited stack pressure is reported. Under the pressure of 1.0&#160;MPa, the Li symmetric cell using a garnet&#8208;type 3D&#8208;SSE fabricated by laser machining shows a high critical current density of 0.7&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 and stable cycling over 500 h under 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8211;2. This excellent performance is attributed to the reduced local current density and amplified mechanical stress at the Li/3D&#8208;SSE interface. These two effects can benefit the flux balance between Li stripping and creep at the interface, thereby preventing interfacial degradation such as void formation and dendrite growth.

         <title>Spacer Cation Alloying in Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Perovskites for Efficient Red Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Precisely Tunable Wavelengths</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and general strategy of spacer cation alloying is developed to modulate the thickness distribution of quantum wells in Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskite films. Based on this method, efficient perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes with tunable emissions between pure red (626&#160;nm) and deep red (671&#160;nm) are achieved with peak external quantum efficiencies up to 11.5%.








Abstract
Perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) have recently shown significant progress with external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) exceeding 20%. However, PeLEDs with pure&#8208;red (620&#8722;660&#160;nm) light emission, an essential part for full&#8208;color displays, remain a great challenge. Herein, a general approach of spacer cation alloying is employed in Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskites (RPPs) for efficient red PeLEDs with precisely tunable wavelengths. By simply tuning the alloying ratio of dual spacer cations, the thickness distribution of quantum wells in the RPP films can be precisely modulated without deteriorating their charge&#8208;transport ability and energy funneling processes. Consequently, efficient PeLEDs with tunable emissions between pure red (626&#160;nm) and deep red (671&#160;nm) are achieved with peak EQEs up to 11.5%, representing the highest values among RPP&#8208;based pure&#8208;red PeLEDs. This work opens a new route for color tuning, which will spur future developments of pure&#8208;red or even pure&#8208;blue PeLEDs with high performance.

         <title>Ionic Covalent Organic Frameworks for Energy Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionic covalent organic frameworks (iCOFs) are porous crystalline polymeric materials where the backbone is composed of 100% covalent bonds and on which ionic groups are functionalized. iCOFs can transport ions rapidly and reliably through the pores. Thus, they are ideal materials for solid electrolytes. Examples proved iCOFs showed excellent performance to make all&#8208;solid&#8208;state and single&#8208;ion conducting Li&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a class of porous crystalline materials whose facile preparation, functionality, and modularity have led to their becoming powerful platforms for the development of molecular devices in many fields of (bio)engineering, such as energy storage, environmental remediation, drug delivery, and catalysis. In particular, ionic COFs (iCOFs) are highly useful for constructing energy devices, as their ionic functional groups can transport ions efficiently, and the nonlabile and highly ordered all&#8208;covalent pore structures of their backbones provide ideal pathways for long&#8208;term ionic transport under harsh electrochemical conditions. Here, current research progress on the use of iCOFs for energy devices, specifically lithium&#8208;based batteries and fuel cells, is reviewed in terms of iCOF backbone&#8208;design strategies, synthetic approaches, properties, engineering techniques, and applications. iCOFs are categorized as anionic COFs or cationic COFs, and how each of these types of iCOFs transport lithium ions, protons, or hydroxides is illustrated. Finally, the current challenges to and future opportunities for the utilization of iCOFs in energy devices are described. This review will therefore serve as a useful reference on state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art iCOF design and application strategies focusing on energy devices.

In particular, ionic COFs (iCOFs) are highly useful for constructing energy devices, as their ionic functional groups can transport ions efficiently, and the nonlabile and highly ordered all-covalent pore structures of their backbones provide ideal pathways for long-term ionic transport under harsh electrochemical conditions. Here, current research progress on the use of iCOFs for energy devices, specifically lithium-based batteries and fuel cells, is reviewed in terms of iCOF backbone-design strategies, synthetic approaches, properties, engineering techniques, and applications. iCOFs are categorized as anionic COFs or cationic COFs, and how each of these types of iCOFs transport lithium ions, protons, or hydroxides is illustrated. Finally, the current challenges to and future opportunities for the utilization of iCOFs in energy devices are described. This review will therefore serve as a useful reference on state-of-the-art iCOF design and application strategies focusing on energy devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Co2&#8211;N6 and Fe&#8211;N4 Costructures Boost Oxygen Reduction Reaction in Both Alkaline and Acidic Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ternary&#8208;atom electrocatalyst, in which atomically dispersed Co2&#8211;N6 and Fe&#8211;N4 sites are coanchored on N&#8208;doped carbon hosts (derived from reaction with ZIF&#8208;8), is synthesized. Synergistic effect is explicitly unraveled that induces higher filling degree of Fe&#8211;d orbitals and outstanding oxygen reduction reaction activity in both alkaline and acidic media.








Abstract
Polynary transition&#8208;metal atom catalysts are promising to supersede platinum (Pt)&#8208;based catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Regulating the local configuration of atomic catalysts is the key to catalyst performance enhancement. Different from the previously reported single&#8208;atom or dual&#8208;atom configurations, a new type of ternary&#8208;atom catalyst, which consists of atomically dispersed, nitrogen&#8208;coordinated Co&#8211;Co dimers, and Fe single sites (i.e., Co2&#8211;N6 and Fe&#8211;N4 structures) that are coanchored on highly graphitized carbon supports is developed. This unique atomic ORR catalyst outperforms the catalysts with only Co2&#8211;N6 or Fe&#8211;N4 sites in both alkaline and acid conditions. Density functional theory calculations clearly unravels the synergistic effect of the Co2&#8211;N6 and Fe&#8211;N4 sites, which can induce higher filling degree of Fe&#8211;d orbitals and favors the binding capability to *OH intermediates (the rate determining step). This ternary&#8208;atom catalyst may be a promising alternative to Pt to drive the cathodic ORR in zinc&#8211;air batteries.

         <title>Light&#8208;Motivated SnO2/TiO2 Heterojunctions Enabling the Breakthrough in Energy Density for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoaccelerated rechargeable lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) employing SnO2/TiO2 heterojunction nanoarrays as a multifunctional anode is demonstrated. The lithiation kinetics and reversibility are greatly enhanced, leading to 1.8 times increase in areal specific capacity without attenuation even for 100 cycles. This finding exhibits a feasible pathway to break the energy density of LIBs by conversion and storage of solar energy.








Abstract
Powering lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) by light&#8208;irradiation will bring a paradigm shift in energy&#8208;storage technologies. Herein, a photoaccelerated rechargeable LIB employing SnO2/TiO2 heterojunction nanoarrays as a multifunctional anode is developed. The electron&#8211;hole pairs generated by the LixTiO2 (x&#160;&#8805; 0) under light irradiation synergistically enhance the lithiation kinetics and electrochemical reversibility of both SnO2 and TiO2. Specifically, the electrons can quickly pour into the SnO2 and the generated Sn due to the more positive conduction band potentials (vs TiO2), and mean while the holes also promote the intercalation of Li+ into TiO2 by reaching charge balance. A remarkable increase in areal specific capacity is therefore achieved from 1.91 to 3.47 mAh cm&#8722;2 at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. More impressively, there is no capacity loss even through 100 cycles, which is the best report for photorechargeable LIBs to date, owing to the strong and stable photoresponse current. This finding exhibits a feasible pathway to break the limitation in the energy density of LIBs by the efficient conversion and storage of solar energy.

Conjugated polyelectrolytes are characterized by an electronically delocalized backbone bearing ionic functionalities. These features lead to properties relevant for use in energy&#8208;storing pseudocapacitor devices, including ionic conductivity, water processability, gel formation, and formation of polaronic species stabilized by electrostatic interactions.

Abstract
Conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) are characterized by an electronically delocalized backbone bearing ionic functionalities. These features lead to properties relevant for use in energy&#8208;storing pseudocapacitor devices, including ionic conductivity, water processability, gel&#8208;formation, and formation of polaronic species stabilized by electrostatic interactions. In this Perspective, the basis for evaluating the figures of merit for pseudocapacitors is provided, together with the techniques used for their evaluation. The general utility and challenges encountered with neutral conjugated polymers are then discussed. Finally, recent advances on the use of CPEs in pseudocapacitor devices are reviewed. The article is concluded by discussing how their miscibility in aqueous media permits the incorporation of CPEs in living materials that are capable of switching function from extraction of energy from bacterial metabolic pathways to pseudocapacitor energy storage.

         <title>Dynamically Tuneable Reflective Structural Coloration with Electroactive Conducting Polymer Nanocavities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemically tuneable structural coloration is demonstrated based on an optical cavity with a conducting polymer based on thienothiophene as electroactive spacer layer. Synergistic effects of optical properties and thickness changes enable low voltage tuning of the structural color across the whole visible range with high and similar reflectance for all the redox states.








Abstract
Dynamic control of structural colors across the visible spectrum with high brightness has proven to be a difficult challenge. Here, this is addressed with a tuneable reflective nano&#8208;optical cavity that uses an electroactive conducting polymer (poly(thieno[3,4&#8208;b]thiophene)) as spacer layer. Electrochemical doping and dedoping of the polymer spacer layer provides reversible tuning of the cavity's structural color throughout the entire visible range and beyond. Furthermore, the cavity provides high peak reflectance that varies only slightly between the reduced and oxidized states of the polymer. The results indicate that the polymer undergoes large reversible thickness changes upon redox tuning, aided by changes in optical properties and low visible absorption. The electroactive cavity concept may find particular use in reflective displays, by opening for tuneable monopixels that eliminate limitations in brightness of traditional subpixel&#8208;based systems.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zinc Batteries Based on Organic/Organic Cathodes Integrating Multi&#8208;Redox Centers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Organic cathode materials with redox&#8208;active sites and flexible structure are promising for developing aqueous zinc ion batteries with high capacity and large output power. However, the energy storage of most organic hosts relies on the coordination/incoordination reaction between Zn2+/H+ and a single functional group, which result in the inferior capacity, low discharge platform, and structural instability. Here, we take the lead in in&#8208;situ electrodepositing stable poly(1,5&#8208;naphthalenediamine, 1,5&#8208;NAPD) as interlayer and excellent conductive poly(para&#8208;aminophenol, pAP) skin onto nanoporous carbon in sequence for the structural optimization of organic/organic cathodes, designated as C@multi&#8208;layer polymer. In&#8208;situ analyses, electrochemical measurements, and theoretical calculation prove that both C = O and C = N active groups can display the strong electron donor as well as Zn2+ host during the discharging process. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of the double organic layers, C@multi&#8208;layer polymer delivers with high capacity, long lifespan, and excellent capacity reservation even at large discharge current and commercial mass loading (&gt; 10&#160;mg cm&#8208;2). Introducing multi redox centers into one organic composites will provide new insights into designing advanced Zn&#8208;organic batteries.

However, the energy storage of most organic hosts relies on the coordination/incoordination reaction between Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and a single functional group, which result in the inferior capacity, low discharge platform, and structural instability. Here, we take the lead in in-situ electrodepositing stable poly(1,5-naphthalenediamine, 1,5-NAPD) as interlayer and excellent conductive poly(para-aminophenol, pAP) skin onto nanoporous carbon in sequence for the structural optimization of organic/organic cathodes, designated as C@multi-layer polymer. In-situ analyses, electrochemical measurements, and theoretical calculation prove that both C = O and C = N active groups can display the strong electron donor as well as Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; host during the discharging process. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of the double organic layers, C@multi-layer polymer delivers with high capacity, long lifespan, and excellent capacity reservation even at large discharge current and commercial mass loading (&amp;gt; 10&#160;mg cm-&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Introducing multi redox centers into one organic composites will provide new insights into designing advanced Zn-organic batteries.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Developing the non&#8208;developable: Creating curved&#8208;surface electronics from non&#8208;stretchable devices</title>

Abstract
The incorporation of electronics onto curved surfaces promises to bring new levels of intelligence to the ergonomic, aesthetic, aerodynamic, and optical surfaces that are ever&#8208;present in our lives. However, since many of these surfaces have two&#8208;dimensional (i.e., non&#8208;developable) curvature, they cannot be formed from the deformation of a flat non&#8208;stretchable sheet. This means that curved electronics cannot capitalize on the rapid technological advances taking place in the field of ultrathin electronics, since ultrathin devices, though ultra&#8208;flexible, are not stretchable. In this work, we present a shrink&#8208;based paradigm to apply such thin&#8208;film electronics to non&#8208;developable surfaces, expanding the capabilities of current non&#8208;developable electronics, and linking future developments in thin&#8208;film technology to similar developments in curved devices. We examine the wrinkling of parylene&#8208;based devices and the effects of shrinkage on common electrical components, culminating in shrinkable touch sensors and organic photovoltaics, laminated to various non&#8208;developable surfaces without loss of performance.

         <title>Fe3O4/Ag/Bi2MoO6 Photoactivatable Nanozyme for Self&#8208;replenishing and Sustainable Cascaded Nanocatalytic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Catalytic cancer therapy based on nanozymes has recently attracted much interest. But the types of the current nanozymes are limited and their efficiency is usually compromised and not sustainable in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Therefore, combination therapy involving additional therapeutics is often necessary and the resulting complication may jeopardize the practical feasibility. Herein, an unprecedented &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; Fe3O4/Ag/Bi2MoO6 nanoparticle (FAB NP) is rationally devised to achieve synergistic chemodynamic, photodynamic, photothermal therapy with guidance by magnetic resonance, photoacoustic, and photothermal imaging. Based on its manifold nanozyme activities (mimicking peroxidase, catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione oxidase) and photodynamic property, cascaded nanocatalytic reactions are enabled and sustained in TME for outstanding therapeutic outcomes. The working mechanisms underlying the intraparticulate interactions, sustainability, and self&#8208;replenishment arising from the coupling between the nanocatalytic reactions and nanozyme activities are carefully revealed, providing new insights into the design of novel nanozymes for nanocatalytic therapy with high efficiency, good specificity, and low side effects.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Harsh&#8208;Environment&#8208;Resistant GaOX Solar&#8208;Blind Photodetectors via Defect and Doping Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Gallium oxide (Ga2O3), with an ultrawide bandgap, is currently regarded as one of the most promising materials for solar&#8208;blind photodetectors (SBPDs), which are greatly demanded in harsh environment, such as the situations of space exploration and flame prewarning. However, realization of high&#8208;performance SBPDs with high tolerance towards harsh environments based on low&#8208;cost Ga2O3 material faces great challenges. Here, defect and doping (DD) engineering towards amorphous GaOX (a&#8208;GaOX) has been proposed to obtain ultrasensitive SBPDs for harsh condition application. Serious oxygen deficiency and doping compensation of the engineered a&#8208;GaOX film ensure the high response currents and low dark currents, respectively. Annealing item in nitrogen of DD engineering also incurs the recrystallization of material, formation of nanopores by oxygen escape, and suppression of sub&#8208;bandgap defect states. As a result, the tailored GaOX SBPD based on DD engineering not only harvests a record&#8208;high responsivity rejection ratio (R254 nm/R365 nm) of 1.8&#215;107, 102 times higher detectivity, and 2&#215;102 times faster decay speed than the control device, but also keeps a high responsivity, high photo&#8208;to&#8208;dark current ratio, and sharp imaging capability even at high temperature (280&#176;C) or high bias (100&#160;V). The proposed DD engineering provides an effective strategy towards highly harsh&#8208;environment&#8208;resistant GaOX SBPDs.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8211;liquid host&#8211;guest composites have featured the ease of fabrication, long&#8208;term stability, and a broad spectrum of unprecedented properties, which cannot be fully met by conventional solid&#8211;solid composites or liquid&#8211;liquid composites. They have greatly evolved in a myriad of emerging applications. With new concepts in mind and persistent efforts, new functions and applications of the solid&#8211;liquid host&#8211;guest composites will appear.








Abstract
Composite materials can provide remarkable improvements over the individual constituents. Especially, with a liquid component introduced into a solid porous host, solid&#8211;liquid host&#8211;guest composites have recently come to the forefront with exceptional functions that promise them for a wealth of applications. Combining the unprecedented dynamic, transparent, omniphobic, self&#8208;healing, diffusive and adaptive nature of functional liquid with inherent solid host's property, solid&#8211;liquid host&#8211;guest composites can realize the ease of fabrication, long&#8208;term stability, and a broad spectrum of enhanced properties, which cannot be fully met by conventional solid&#8211;solid composites or liquid&#8211;liquid composites. This review presents the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art progress in solid&#8211;liquid host&#8211;guest composites. Initially, the concept, classification, design strategy, as well as fabrication methods as a path forward to develop the composites are unraveled, and further it is elaborated on how the functionality of porous solid and functional liquid can be harnessed to create composites with a broad range of unique properties, especially, the optical, thermal, electric, mechanical, sorption, and separation properties. With these fascinating properties, a myriad of emerging applications such as optical devices, thermal management, electromagnetic&#8208;interference shielding, soft electronics, gas capture and release, and multiphase separations are touched upon, inspiring more frontier researches in materials science, interfacial chemistry, membrane science, engineering, and multidisciplinary. Finally, this review provides the perspective on the future directions of solid&#8211;liquid host&#8211;guest composites and assesses the challenges and opportunities ahead.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Dependent Intermediate Adsorption Modulation on Iridium&#8208;Modified Black Phosphorus Electrocatalysts for Efficient pH&#8208;Universal Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient iridium&#8208;modified 2D black phosphorus electrocatalyst is rationally designed to achieve the desired adsorption energies toward catalytic intermediates, and the resultant catalyst demonstrates outstanding pH&#8208;universal water splitting performances, surpassing the commercially dominate catalysts. Furthermore, an interesting surface&#8208;dependent activity enhancement mechanism is identified.








Abstract
2D black phosphorus (BP) is one promising electrocatalyst toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysis. The too strong adsorption of oxygen intermediates during OER, while the too weak adsorption of hydrogen intermediate during HER, however, greatly compromise its practical water splitting applications with overpotentials as high as 450&#160;mV for OER and 420&#160;mV for HER to achieve 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 under alkaline conditions. Herein, by rationally introducing the nanosized iridium (Ir) modifier together with optimized exposing surface toward electrolytes, an efficient Ir&#8208;modified BP electrocatalyst with much favorable adsorption energies toward catalytic intermediates possesses an outstanding pH&#8208;universal water splitting performance, surpassing the nearly all reported BP&#8208;based catalysts and the commercial noble&#8208;metal catalysts. The Ir&#8208;modified BP catalyst with the optimized exposed surfaces only requires an overall cell voltage of 1.54 and 1.57&#160;V to achieve 10 mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in acidic and alkaline electrolysers, respectively.

     alt="Surface-Dependent Intermediate Adsorption Modulation on Iridium-Modified Black Phosphorus Electrocatalysts for Efficient pH-Universal Water Splitting"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An efficient iridium-modified 2D black phosphorus electrocatalyst is rationally designed to achieve the desired adsorption energies toward catalytic intermediates, and the resultant catalyst demonstrates outstanding pH-universal water splitting performances, surpassing the commercially dominate catalysts. Furthermore, an interesting surface-dependent activity enhancement mechanism is identified.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2D black phosphorus (BP) is one promising electrocatalyst toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysis. The too strong adsorption of oxygen intermediates during OER, while the too weak adsorption of hydrogen intermediate during HER, however, greatly compromise its practical water splitting applications with overpotentials as high as 450&#160;mV for OER and 420&#160;mV for HER to achieve 10&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; under alkaline conditions. Herein, by rationally introducing the nanosized iridium (Ir) modifier together with optimized exposing surface toward electrolytes, an efficient Ir-modified BP electrocatalyst with much favorable adsorption energies toward catalytic intermediates possesses an outstanding pH-universal water splitting performance, surpassing the nearly all reported BP-based catalysts and the commercial noble-metal catalysts. The Ir-modified BP catalyst with the optimized exposed surfaces only requires an overall cell voltage of 1.54 and 1.57&#160;V to achieve 10 mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in acidic and alkaline electrolysers, respectively. This design uncovers the potential applications of 2D BP in practical electrocatalysis fields via decreasing reaction intermediate adsorption energy barriers and promoting the interfacial electron coupling for heterostructured catalysts, and offers new insights into the surface-dependent activity enhancement mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Advanced Point&#8208;of&#8208;Care Testing Technologies for Human Acute Respiratory Virus Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The advanced rapid point&#8208;of&#8208;care tests (POCTs), including nucleic acid amplification, optical POCTs, electrochemistry, lateral flow assay, microfluidics, ELISA, and microarray&#8208;based platforms, act figuratively as the Great Wall to the widespread transmission of acute respiratory virus infections by enabling early and rapid detection of these pathogens, as is the case during the current pandemic.








Abstract
The ever&#8208;growing global threats to human life caused by the human acute respiratory virus (RV) infections have cost billions of lives, created a significant economic burden, and shaped society for centuries. The timely response to emerging RVs could save human lives and reduce the medical care burden. The development of RV detection technologies is essential for potentially preventing RV pandemic and epidemics. However, commonly used detection technologies lack sensitivity, specificity, and speed, thus often failing to provide the rapid turnaround times. To address this problem, new technologies are devised to address the performance inadequacies of the traditional methods. These emerging technologies offer improvements in convenience, speed, flexibility, and portability of point&#8208;of&#8208;care test (POCT). Herein, recent developments in POCT are comprehensively reviewed for eight typical acute respiratory viruses. This review discusses the challenges and opportunities of various recognition and detection strategies and discusses these according to their detection principles, including nucleic acid amplification, optical POCT, electrochemistry, lateral flow assays, microfluidics, enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assays, and microarrays. The importance of limits of detection, throughput, portability, and specificity when testing clinical samples in resource&#8208;limited settings is emphasized. Finally, the evaluation of commercial POCT kits for both essential RV diagnosis and clinical&#8208;oriented practices is included.

         <dc:description>
Ischemic microenvironment (IME)&#8208;responsive therapeutic modalities are defined in the present review. Fundamental principles and basic features of ischemic microenvironment are overviewed. Promising ischemic microenvironment&#8208;responsive therapeutic strategies are introduced and summarized. Perspectives toward the clinical practices based on the ischemic microenvironment&#8208;responsive biomaterials are outlooked.








Abstract
Cardiovascular diseases caused by ischemia are attracting considerable attention owing to its high morbidity and mortality worldwide. Although numerous agents with cardioprotective benefits have been identified, their clinical outcomes are hampered by their low bioavailability, poor drug solubility, and systemic adverse effects. Advances in nanoscience and nanotechnology provide a new opportunity to effectively deliver drugs for treating ischemia&#8208;related diseases. In particular, cardiac ischemia leads to a characteristic pathological environment called an ischemic microenvironment (IME), significantly different from typical cardiac regions. These remarkable differences between ischemic sites and normal tissues have inspired the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive systems for the targeted delivery of therapeutic drugs to damaged cardiomyocytes. Recently, many biomaterials with intelligent properties have been developed to enhance the therapeutic benefits of drugs for the treatment of myocardial ischemia. Strategies for stimuli&#8208;responsive drug delivery and release based on IME include reactive oxygen species, pH&#8208;, hypoxia&#8208;, matrix metalloproteinase&#8208;, and platelet&#8208;inspired targeting strategies. In this review, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art IME&#8208;responsive biomaterials for the treatment of myocardial ischemia are summarized. Perspectives, limitations, and challenges are also discussed for the further development of innovative and effective approaches to treat ischemic diseases with high effectiveness and biocompatibility.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Palladium&#8208;Based Nanocrystals with Different Crystal Phases and a Comparison of Their Catalytic Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
There is a strong interest in developing phase&#8208;controlled metal nanocrystals to enhance their catalytic activity. Herein, template&#8208;directed growth is used to synthesize Ru@Pd nanocrystals with the Pd shells in either an fcc or hcp phase, and their catalytic properties are compared.








Abstract
A relatively unexplored aspect of noble&#8208;metal nanomaterials is polymorphism, or their ability to crystallize in different crystal phases. Here, a method is reported for the facile synthesis of Ru@Pd core&#8211;shell nanocrystals featuring polymorphism, with the core made of hexagonally close&#8208;packed (hcp)&#8208;Ru while the Pd shell takes either an hcp or face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) phase. The polymorphism shows a dependence on the shell thickness, with shells thinner than &#8776;1.4&#160;nm taking the hcp phase whereas the thicker ones revert to fcc. The injection rate provides an experimental knob for controlling the phase, with one&#8208;shot and drop&#8208;wise injection of the Pd precursor corresponding to fcc&#8208;Pd and hcp&#8208;Pd shells, respectively. When these nanocrystals are tested as catalysts toward formic acid oxidation, the Ru@Pdhcp nanocrystals outperform Ru@Pdfcc in terms of both specific activity and peak potential. Density functional theory calculations are also performed to elucidate the origin of this performance enhancement.

         <title>Superior High&#8208;Temperature Strength in a Supersaturated Refractory High&#8208;Entropy Alloy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural materials with exceptional high&#8208;temperature strengths are highly desirable for high&#8208;temperature applications. Here, three alloy&#8208;design principles of the large atomic&#8208;size and elastic&#8208;modulus mismatches, the insensitive temperature&#8208;dependence of elastic properties, and the dominance of non&#8208;screw dislocations are used to design a CrMoNbV refractory high&#8208;entropy alloy, which exhibits outperforming high&#8208;temperature strengths.








Abstract
Refractory high&#8208;entropy alloys (RHEAs) show promising applications at high temperatures. However, achieving high strengths at elevated temperatures above 1173K is still challenging due to heat softening. Using intrinsic material characteristics as the alloy&#8208;design principles, a single&#8208;phase body&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (BCC) CrMoNbV RHEA with high&#8208;temperature strengths (beyond 1000&#160;MPa at 1273 K) is designed, superior to other reported RHEAs as well as conventional superalloys. The origin of the high&#8208;temperature strength is revealed by in situ neutron scattering, transmission&#8208;electron microscopy, and first&#8208;principles calculations. The CrMoNbV's elevated&#8208;temperature strength retention up to 1273 K arises from its large atomic&#8208;size and elastic&#8208;modulus mismatches, the insensitive temperature dependence of elastic constants, and the dominance of non&#8208;screw character dislocations caused by the strong solute pinning, which makes the solid&#8208;solution strengthening pronounced. The alloy&#8208;design principles and the insights in this study pave the way to design RHEAs with outstanding high&#8208;temperature strength.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
When enzymes with deep, narrow active sites are embedded inside of plastics, chain&#8208;end&#8208;mediated processive depolymerization is realized. However, polymer additives can induce bending in crystalline lamellae, which causes chain ends to preferentially segregate at the crystal/amorphous interface where they are inaccessible for enzyme binding. Synergistic enzyme mechanisms can be exploited to create new chain ends and facilitate near&#8208;complete depolymerization.








Abstract
Embedding catalysts inside of plastics affords accelerated chemical modification with programmable latency and pathways. Nanoscopically embedded enzymes can lead to near&#8208;complete degradation of polyesters via chain&#8208;end mediated processive depolymerization. The overall degradation rate and pathways have a strong dependence on the morphology of semicrystalline polyesters. Yet, most studies to date focus on pristine polymers instead of mixtures that contain additives and other components despite their nearly universal use in plastic production. Here, additives are introduced to purposely change the morphology of polycaprolactone (PCL) by increasing the bending and twisting of crystalline lamellae. These morphological changes immobilize chain ends preferentially at the crystalline/amorphous interfaces and limit chain&#8208;end accessibility by the embedded processive enzyme. This chain&#8208;end redistribution reduces the polymer&#8208;to&#8208;monomer conversion from &gt;95%&#160;to less than 50%, causing formation of highly crystalline plastic pieces, including microplastics. By synergizing both random chain scission and processive depolymerization, it is feasible to navigate morphological changes in polymer/additive blends and to achieve near&#8208;complete depolymerization. The random scission enzymes in the amorphous domains create new chain ends that are subsequently bound and depolymerized by processive enzymes. Present studies further highlight the importance to consider how the host polymer's morphologies affect the reactions catalyzed by embedded catalytic species.

         <title>N&#8208;Type Surface Design for p&#8208;Type CZTSSe Thin Film to Attain High Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An n&#8208;type surface is realized successfully on the p&#8208;type CZTSSe thin film by controlling the Ag distribution using Ag2ZnSnS4/Al2O3/CZTS precursors. The photo&#8208;generated charge collection is improved and the interface recombination is suppressed, thus significantly improving the conversion efficiency of the CZTSSe solar cells.








Abstract
As a low&#8208;cost substitute that uses no expensive rare&#8208;earth elements for the high&#8208;efficiency Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 solar cell, the Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) solar cell has borrowed optimization strategies used for its predecessor to improve its device performance, including a profiled band gap and surface inversion. Indeed, there have been few reports of constructing CZTSSe absorber layers with surface inversion to improve efficiency. Here, a strategy that designs the CZTSSe absorber to attain surface modification by using n&#8208;type Ag2ZnSnS4 is demonstrated. It has been discovered that Ag plays two major roles in the kesterite thin film devices: surface inversion and front gradient distribution. It has not only an excellent carrier transport effect and reduced probability of electron&#8208;hole recombination but also results in increased carrier separation by increasing the width of the depletion region, leading to much improved VOC and JSC. Finally, a champion CZTSSe solar cell renders efficiency as high as 12.55%, one of the highest for its type, with the open&#8208;circuit voltage deficit reduced to as low as 0.306&#160;V (63.2% Shockley&#8208;Queisser limit). The band engineering for surface modification of the absorber and high efficiency achieved here shine a new light on the future of the CZTSSe solar cell.

         <title>High&#8208;Speed Fabrication of All&#8208;Inkjet&#8208;Printed Organometallic Halide Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes on Elastic Substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inkjet&#8208;printing approaches are used to fabricate flexible organometallic halide perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes on elastic substrates from the bottom anode to the top cathode under ambient conditions. The fabrication time is significantly shortened by at least tenfold. The device has a novel simplified 4&#8208;layer structure without conventional electron&#8208; and hole&#8208;transport&#8208;layer, but still exhibiting extremely high performance even under aggressive bending tests.








Abstract
Halide perovskites have great potential for use in high&#8208;performance light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) and displays. Here, a perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs) fabricated directly on an elastomer substrate, in which every single layer in the device from bottom anode to top cathode is patterned solely using a highly scalable inkjet printing process, is reported. Compared to PeLEDs made using conventional microfabrication processes, the printing process significantly shortens the fabrication time by at least tenfold (from over 5 h to less than 25 min). The all&#8208;printed PeLEDs have a novel 4&#8208;layer structure (bottom electrode, perovskite emissive layer, buffer layer, top electrode) without separate electron or hole transporting layers. For flexible PeLEDs printed directly in ambient conditions, a turn&#8208;on voltage, maximum luminance intensity, and maximum current efficiency of 3.46&#160;V, 10227&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, and 2.01&#160;cd&#160;A&#8722;1, respectively, is achieved. The devices also exhibit excellent robustness and stability even when bent to a curvature radius of 2.5&#160;mm. The reported device structure and fabrication processes can enable high&#8208;performance flexible PeLEDs to be manufactured over a larger area at extremely low cost and fast speed, which can facilitate the adoption of the promising PeLED technology in the emerging foldable displays, smart wearables, and many other applications.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An antipulverization and high&#8208;continuity lithium metal anode comprising a small number of solid&#8208;state electrolyte nanoparticles as conformal/sacrificial fillers and a copper foil as supporting current collector is proposed to improve the lithium electrode stability and extend the cyclability of batteries.








Abstract
Lithium metal is one of the most promising anode candidates for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy batteries. Nevertheless, lithium pulverization and associated loss of electrical contact remain significant challenges. Here, an antipulverization and high&#8208;continuity lithium metal anode comprising a small number of solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) nanoparticles as conformal/sacrificial fillers and a copper (Cu) foil as the supporting current collector is reported. Guiding by the SSE, this new anode facilitates lithium nucleation, contributing to form a roundly shaped, micro&#8208;sized, and dendrite&#8208;free electrode during cycling, which effectively mitigates the lithium dendrite growth. The embedded Cu current collector in the hybrid anode not only reinforces the mechanical strength but also improves the efficient charge transfer among active lithium filaments, affording good electrode structural integrity and electrical continuity. As a result, this antipulverization and high&#8208;continuity lithium anode delivers a high average Coulombic efficiency of &#8776;99.6% for 300 cycles under a current density of 1 mA cm&#8722;2. Lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (elemental sulfur or sulfurized polyacrylonitrile cathodes) equipped with this anode show high&#8208;capacity retentions in their corresponding ether&#8208;based or carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes, respectively. This new electrode provides important insight into the design of electrodes that may experience large volume variation during operations.

         <title>Conductive CuCo&#8208;Based Bimetal Organic Framework for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conductive bimetal&#8208;based catecholate (CAT) nanorod arrays show excellent hydrogen evolution reaction activities in both alkaline and neutral electrolyte, comparable to that of the benchmark Pt/C. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the incorporation of Co not only optimize the &#916;GH* and the adsorption energy of water (&#916;EH2O) of Cu&#8208;CAT, but also increase the electrical conductivity of Cu&#8208;CAT.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with intrinsically porous structures and well&#8208;dispersed metal sites are promising candidates for electrocatalysis; however, the catalytic efficiencies of most MOFs are significantly limited by their impertinent adsorption/desorption energy of intermediates formed during electrocatalysis and very low electrical conductivity. Herein, Co is introduced into conductive Cu&#8208;catecholate (Cu&#8208;CAT) nanorod arrays directly grown on a flexible carbon cloth for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Electrochemical results show that the Co&#8208;incorporated Cu&#8208;CAT nanorod arrays only need 52 and 143&#160;mV overpotentials to drive a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in alkaline and neutral media for HER, respectively, much lower than most of the reported non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts and comparable to the benchmark Pt/C electrocatalyst. Density functional theory calculations show that the introduction of Co can optimize the adsorption energy of hydrogen (&#916;GH*) of Cu sites, almost close to that of Pt (111). Furthermore, the adsorption energy of water (&#916;EH2O) of Co sites in the CuCo&#8208;CAT is significantly lower than that of Cu sites upon coupling Cu with Co, effectively accelerating the Volmer step in the HER process. The findings, synergistic effect of bimetals, open a new avenue for the rational design of highly efficient MOF&#8208;based electrocatalysts.

&lt;sub&gt;H*&lt;/sub&gt; and the adsorption energy of water (&#916;EH2O) of Cu-CAT, but also increase the electrical conductivity of Cu-CAT.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with intrinsically porous structures and well-dispersed metal sites are promising candidates for electrocatalysis; however, the catalytic efficiencies of most MOFs are significantly limited by their impertinent adsorption/desorption energy of intermediates formed during electrocatalysis and very low electrical conductivity. Herein, Co is introduced into conductive Cu-catecholate (Cu-CAT) nanorod arrays directly grown on a flexible carbon cloth for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Electrochemical results show that the Co-incorporated Cu-CAT nanorod arrays only need 52 and 143&#160;mV overpotentials to drive a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in alkaline and neutral media for HER, respectively, much lower than most of the reported non-noble metal-based electrocatalysts and comparable to the benchmark Pt/C electrocatalyst. Density functional theory calculations show that the introduction of Co can optimize the adsorption energy of hydrogen (&#916;&lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;H*&lt;/sub&gt;) of Cu sites, almost close to that of Pt (111). Furthermore, the adsorption energy of water (&#916;EH2O) of Co sites in the CuCo-CAT is significantly lower than that of Cu sites upon coupling Cu with Co, effectively accelerating the Volmer step in the HER process. The findings, synergistic effect of bimetals, open a new avenue for the rational design of highly efficient MOF-based electrocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fe&#8208;Ion Bolted VOPO4&#8729;2H2O as an Aqueous Fe&#8208;Ion Battery Electrode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron ion batteries are promising for grid energy storage due to their low cost and compatibility with aqueous electrolytes. This work demonstrates vanadium oxyphosphate as a capable cathode to host Fe2+. Vanadium oxyphosphate exhibits structural stability favoring Fe2+ to Zn2+ due to the bolting effect by the pre&#8208;intercalated Fe3+ before battery cycling.








Abstract
Iron ion batteries using Fe2+ as a charge carrier have yet to be widely explored, and they lack high&#8208;performing Fe2+ hosting cathode materials to couple with the iron metal anode. Here, it is demonstrated that VOPO4&#8729;2H2O can reversibly host Fe2+ with a high specific capacity of 100 mAh g&#8722;1 and stable cycling performance, where 68% of the initial capacity is retained over 800 cycles. In sharp contrast, VOPO4&#8729;2H2O's capacity of hosting Zn2+ fades precipitously over tens of cycles. VOPO4&#8729;2H2O stores Fe2+ with a unique mechanism, where upon contacting the electrolyte by the VOPO4&#8729;2H2O electrode, Fe2+ ions from the electrolyte get oxidized to Fe3+ ions that are inserted and trapped in the VOPO4&#8729;2H2O structure in an electroless redox reaction. The trapped Fe3+ ions, thus, bolt the layered structure of VOPO4&#8729;2H2O, which prevents it from dissolution into the electrolyte during (de)insertion of Fe2+. The findings offer a new strategy to use a redox&#8208;active ion charge carrier to stabilize the layered electrode materials.

         <title>Multifunctional Macroassembled Graphene Nanofilms with High Crystallinity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly crystalline macroassembled graphene nanofilms prepared by a camphor&#8208;assisted cooling&#8211;contraction strategy show excellent physical properties and advantages in high&#8208;performance electronic and optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
A &#8220;cooling&#8211;contraction&#8221; method to separate large&#8208;area (up to 4.2&#160;cm in lateral size) graphene oxide (GO)&#8208;assembled films (of nanoscale thickness) from substrates is reported. Heat treatment at 3000&#160;&#176;C of such free&#8208;standing macroscale films yields highly crystalline &#8220;macroassembled graphene nanofilms&#8221; (nMAGs) with 16&#8211;48&#160;nm thickness. These nMAGs present tensile strength of 5.5&#8211;11.3&#160;GPa (with &#8776;3&#160;&#181;m gauge length), electrical conductivity of 1.8&#8211;2.1 MS m&#8722;1, thermal conductivity of 2027&#8211;2820 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1, and carrier relaxation time up to &#8776;23&#160;ps. As a demonstration application, an nMAG&#8208;based sound&#8208;generator shows a 30 &#181;s response and sound pressure level of 89&#160;dB at 1 W cm&#8722;2. A THz metasurface fabricated from nMAG has a light response of 8.2% for 0.159 W mm&#8722;2 and can detect down to 0.01&#160;ppm of glucose. The approach provides a straightforward way to form highly crystallized graphene nanofilms from low&#8208;cost GO sheets.

         <title>Managing Growth and Dimensionality of Quasi 2D Perovskite Single&#8208;Crystalline Flakes for Tunable Excitons Orientation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Centimeter&#8208;sized quasi 2D&#8208;perovskites with tunable number of inorganic layers are synthesized by an innovative synthetic approach based on the use of a reactant, potassium iodide, that can modulate the supersaturation levels of the perovskite precursors solution without being part of the final products. Excitons orientation is changed from &#8220;in&#8208;plane&#8221; to &#8220;out&#8208;of&#8208;plane&#8221; by increasing the &#8220;n&#8221; value.








Abstract
Hybrid perovskites are among the most promising materials for optoelectronic applications. Their 2D crystalline form is even more interesting since the alternating inorganic and organic layers naturally forge a multiple quantum&#8208;well structure, leading to the formation of stable excitonic resonances. Nevertheless, a controlled modulation of the quantum well width, which is defined by the number of inorganic layers (n) between two organic ones, is not trivial and represents the main synthetic challenge in the field. Here, a conceptually innovative approach to easily tune n in lead iodide perovskite single&#8208;crystalline flakes is presented. The judicious use of potassium iodide is found to modulate the supersaturation levels of the precursors solution without being part of the final products. This allows to obtain a fine tuning of the n value. The excellent optical quality of the as synthesized flakes guarantees an in&#8208;depth analysis by Fourier&#8208;space microscopy, revealing that the excitons orientation can be manipulated by modifying the number of inorganic layers. Excitonic out&#8208;of&#8208;plane component, indeed, is enhanced when &#8220;n&#8221; is increased. The combined advances in the synthesis and optical characterization fill in the picture of the exciton behavior in low&#8208;dimensional perovskite, paving the way to the design of materials with improved optoelectronic characteristics.

         <title>The importance of surface adsorbates in solution&#8208;processed thermoelectric materials: the case of SnSe</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Solution synthesis of particles emerged as an alternative to prepare thermoelectric materials with less demanding processing conditions than conventional solid&#8208;state synthetic methods. However, solution synthesis generally involves the presence of additional molecules or ions belonging to the precursors or added to enable solubility and/or regulate nucleation and growth. These molecules or ions can end up in the particles as surface adsorbates and interfere in the material properties. This work demonstrates that ionic adsorbates, in particular Na&#8314; ions, are electrostatically adsorbed in SnSe particles synthesized in water and play a crucial role not only in directing the material nano/microstructure but also in determining the transport properties of the consolidated material. In dense pellets prepared by sintering SnSe particles, Na&#160;remains within the crystal lattice as dopant, in dislocations, precipitates, and forming grain boundary complexions. These results highlight the importance of considering all the possible unintentional impurities to establish proper structure&#8208;property relationships and control material properties in solution&#8208;processed thermoelectric materials.

         <title>Tin Halide Perovskites: From Fundamental Properties to Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Metal halide perovskites have unique optical and electrical properties, which make them an excellent class of materials for a broad spectrum of optoelectronic applications. However, it is with photovoltaic devices that this class of materials has reached the apotheosis of popularity, and is the massive interests of a large community of researchers that has led to a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.5% only after 10 years from their first use. Nevertheless, such high performance is achieved with Pb&#8208;based compounds, which are toxic to the environment. Therefore, in the last years a considerable research effort has been focused to substitute Pb with other less toxic group IVA metals. Sn&#8208;based perovskites are the most promising alternative because of their band&#8208;gap close to the optimal value for photovoltaic applications, the strong optical absorption, and the good charge carrier mobilities. Nevertheless, the low defect tolerance, the fast crystallization, and the oxidative instability of tin halide perovskites has confined till now the power conversion efficiency to much lower values of the one obtained with Pb&#8208;based perovskites. We believe that fundamental understanding of the electronic properties and of the film formation process is imperative to bring Sn&#8208;based devices at the level of Pb&#8208;based one. With this review we aim to give a detailed overview of the crystallographic, photophysical, and optoelectronic properties of Sn&#8208;based perovskite compounds in their multiple forms from the 3D systems till low dimensional structures. At the end, recent progresses in Sn&#8208;based perovskite solar cells are reviewed, mainly focusing on the detail of the strategies adopted to improve the device performances. For each sub&#8208;topic the current challenges and the outlook are discussed, with the aim to stimulate the community to address the most important issues in a concerted manner.

         <title>Enzymatically Transformable Polymersome&#8208;Based Nanotherapeutics to Eliminate Minimal Relapsable Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzymatically transformable nanotherapeutics is presented to improve the targeted delivery of old drugs&#8212;MMP inhibitor and colchicine&#8212;into minimal relapsable cancer. This distinct combination therapy not only ensures direct killing of residual cancer cells but also disrupts the premetastatic microenvironment to prevent distant seeding/outgrowth, which radically reduces metastatic and local&#8208;regional recurrence after surgery.








Abstract
Prevention of metastatic and local&#8208;regional recurrence of cancer after surgery remains difficult. Targeting postsurgical premetastatic niche and microresiduals presents an excellent prospective opportunity but is often challenged by poor therapeutic delivery into minimal residual tumors. Here, an enzymatically transformable polymer&#8208;based nanotherapeutic approach is presented that exploits matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) overactivation in tumor&#8208;associated tissues to guide the codelivery of colchicine (microtubule&#8208;disrupting and anti&#8208;inflammatory agent) and marimastat (MMP inhibitor). The dePEGylation of polymersomes catalyzed by MMPs not only exposes the guanidine moiety to improve tissue/cell&#8208;targeting/retention to increase bioavailability, but also differentially releases marimastat and colchicine to engage their extracellular (MMPs) and intracellular (microtubules) targets of action, respectively. In primary tumors/overt metastases, the vasculature&#8208;specific targeting of nanotherapeutics can function synchronously with the enhanced permeability and retention effect to deter malignant progression of metastatic breast cancer. After the surgical removal of large primary tumors, nanotherapeutic agents are localized in the premetastatic niche and at the site of the postsurgical wound, disrupting the premetastatic microenvironment and eliminating microresiduals, which radically reduces metastatic and local&#8208;regional recurrence. The findings suggest that nanotherapeutics can safely widen the therapeutic window to resuscitate colchicine and MMP inhibitors for other inflammatory disorders.

         <title>ZnS@BSA Nanoclusters Potentiate Efficacy of Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ZnS@BSA (bovine serum albumin) nanoclusters can promote reactive oxygen species accumulation and activate cyclic guanosine monophosphate&#8208;adenosine monophosphate synthase/interferon gene stimulator signals in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), further suppressing tumor growth with more immune cells infiltration, which can serve as a new strategy for immunotherapy of HCC.








Abstract
Although immunotherapy such as immune checkpoint inhibitors has shown promising efficacy in cancer treatment, the responsiveness among patients is relatively limited. Activation of the cyclic guanosine monophosphate&#8208;adenosine monophosphate synthase/interferon gene stimulator (cGAS/STING) signaling pathway to upregulate innate immunity has become an emerging strategy for enhancing tumor immunotherapy. Herein, ZnS@BSA (bovine serum albumin) nanoclusters synthesized via a self&#8208;assembly approach are reported, where the released zinc ions under acidic tumor microenvironment significantly enhance cGAS/STING signals. Meanwhile, intracellular zinc ions can produce reactive oxygen species, which is further facilitated by the generated H2S gas from ZnS@BSA via specifically inhibiting catalase in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. It is found that the nanoclusters activate the cGAS/STING signals in mice, which promotes the infiltration of CD8+ T cells at the tumor site and cross&#8208;presentation of dendritic cells, leading to an improved immunotherapy efficacy against hepatocellular carcinoma.

         <title>A Critical Outlook for the Pursuit of Lower Contact Resistance in Organic Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Though organic transistors have long been considered as a potential cornerstone technology for flexible electronics applications, their widespread commercialization in high&#8208;frequency circuits has been substantially impeded by high contact resistance. A review of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art reveals the pivotal role of the organic&#8208;semiconductor morphology and the key challenges now to be overcome, such as Fermi&#8208;level pinning and low charge&#8208;carrier densities.








Abstract
To take full advantage of recent and anticipated improvements in the performance of organic semiconductors employed in organic transistors, the high contact resistance arising at the interfaces between the organic semiconductor and the source and drain contacts must be reduced significantly. To date, only a small portion of the accumulated research on organic thin&#8208;film transistors (TFTs) has reported channel&#8208;width&#8208;normalized contact resistances below 100 &#937;cm, well above what is regularly demonstrated in transistors based on inorganic semiconductors. A closer look at these cases and the relevant literature strongly suggests that the most significant factor leading to the lowest contact resistances in organic TFTs so far has been the control of the thin&#8208;film morphology of the organic semiconductor. By contrast, approaches aimed at increasing the charge&#8208;carrier density and/or reducing the intrinsic Schottky barrier height have so far played a relatively minor role in achieving the lowest contact resistances. Herein, the possible explanations for these observations are explored, including the prevalence of Fermi&#8208;level pinning and the difficulties in forming optimized interfaces with organic semiconductors. An overview of the research on these topics is provided, and potential device&#8208;engineering solutions are discussed based on recent advancements in the theoretical and experimental work on both organic and inorganic semiconductors.

         <title>Transformation Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transformation optics and metamaterials are useful and interesting techniques to control wave propagation at will. A comprehensive overview on manipulation of wave propagation based on coordinate transformation method and metamaterials is provided. Selected experimental fabrications for diverse waves, such as electromagnetic waves and stationary fields, are presented to demonstrate frontiers of transformation metamaterials.








Abstract
Based on the form&#8208;invariance of Maxwell's equations under coordinate transformations, mathematically smooth deformation of space can be physically equivalent to inhomogeneous and anisotropic electromagnetic (EM) medium (called a transformation medium). It provides a geometric recipe to control EM waves at will. A series of examples of achieving transformation media by artificially structured units from conventional materials is summarized here. Such concepts are firstly implemented for EM waves, and then extended to other wave dynamics, such as elastic waves, acoustic waves, surface water waves, and even stationary fields. These shall be cataloged as transformation metamaterials. In addition, it might be conceptually attractive and practically useful to control diverse waves for multi&#8208;physics designs.

         <title>Intrinsic Linear Dichroism of Organic Single Crystals toward High&#8208;Performance Polarization&#8208;Sensitive Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A superior organic semiconductor, 2,6&#8208;diphenyl anthracene (DPA), is selected to develop polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors. High&#8208;quality DPA crystals exhibit strong anisotropic nature. Their photodetectors show remarkable polarization sensitivity with a dichroic ratio up to &#8776;1.9. It is revealed that intrinsic linear dichroism is responsible for the observed polarization sensitivity. This work demonstrates the potential of developing efficient polarization&#8208;sensitive organic photodetectors for diverse applications.








Abstract
The ability to detect light in photodetectors is central to practical optoelectronic applications, which has been demonstrated in inorganic semiconductor devices. However, so far, the study of polarization&#8208;sensitive organic photodetectors, which have unique applications in flexible and wearable electronics, has not received much attention. Herein, the construction of polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors based on the single crystals of a superior optoelectronic organic semiconductor, 2,6&#8208;diphenyl anthracene (DPA), is demonstrated. The systematic characterization of two&#8208;dimensionally grown DPA crystals with various techniques definitely show their strong anisotropy in molecular vibration, optical reflectance and optical absorption. In terms of polarization sensitivity, DPA&#8208;crystal based photodetectors exhibit a linear dichroic ratio up to &#8776;1.9. Theoretical calculations confirm that intrinsic linear dichroism, originated from the anisotropic in&#8208;plane crystal structure, is responsible for the polarization sensitivity of DPA crystals. This work opens up a new door for exploiting organic semiconductors for developing highly compact polarization photodetectors and providing new functionalities in novel flexible optical and optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Carbon Superstructures Achieving Ultra&#8208;Stable and Fast Proton&#8208;Coupled Charge Storage Kinetics</title>

Complementary acceptor&#8208;donor molecules of 2,4,6&#8208;trichloro&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine and 2,6&#8208;diaminoanthraquinone form a porous organic polymer with &#8220;protic salt&#8221;&#8208;type rigid skeleton linked by &#8722;NH2+Cl&#8722;&#8722; &#8220;rivets&#8221;, which offers the cornerstone for H&#8208;bonding self&#8208;assembly of the organic backbone to carbon superstructures by &#960;&#8722;&#960; plane stacking. The superstructures achieve ultra&#8208;stable and fast proton&#8208;coupled charge storage kinetics, giving unprecedented lifespan (1&#160;000&#160;000 cycles) and high energy&#8208;density for carbon (zinc) supercapacitors.








Abstract
Designing ingenious and stable carbon nanostructures is critical but still challenging for use in energy storage devices with superior electrochemistry kinetics, durable capacitive activity, and high rate survivability. To pursue the objective, a simple self&#8208;assembly strategy is developed to access carbon superstructures built of nanoparticle embedded plates. The carbon precursors, 2,4,6&#8208;trichloro&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine and 2,6&#8208;diaminoanthraquinone can form porous organic polymer with &#8220;protic salt&#8221;&#8208;type rigid skeleton linked by &#8722;NH2+Cl&#8722;&#8722; &#8220;rivets&#8221;, which provides the cornerstone for hydrogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;guided self&#8208;assembly of the organic backbone to superstructures by &#960;&#8722;&#960; plane stacking. The ameliorative charge density distribution and decreased adsorption energy in as&#8208;fabricated carbon superstructures allow the high accessibility of the build&#8208;in protophilic sites and efficient ion diffusion with a low energy barrier. Such superstructures thus deliver ultra&#8208;stable charge storage and fast proton&#8208;coupled kinetics at the structural&#8722;chemical defects, contributing to unprecedented lifespan (1&#160;000&#160;000 cycles), high&#8208;rate capability (100 A g&#8722;1) for carbon&#8208;based supercapacitors, and an ultrahigh energy density (128&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1) for Zn&#8208;ion hybrid supercapacitors. The self&#8208;assembled carbon superstructures significantly improve the all&#8208;round electrochemical performances, and hold great promise for efficient energy storage.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Single&#8208;Atom Tailoring with Bifunctional Integration for High&#8208;Performance CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co&#8211;Ru dual&#8208;atoms inside conjugated porous carbon nitride polymer are designed for regulation of outstanding synergistic photocatalysis during light&#8208;driven CO2 conversion, of which the bi&#8208;functionalized Co&#8211;Ru sites feature atom&#8208;specific functions with Co for dynamic carrier mobility and Ru for selective CO2 surface&#8208;boundinteraction.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom photocatalysis has been demonstrated as a novel strategy to promote heterogeneous reactions. There is a diversity of monoatomic metal species with specific functions; however, integrating representative merits into dual&#8208;single&#8208;atoms and regulating cooperative photocatalysis remain a pressing challenge. For dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom catalysts, enhanced photocatalytic activity would be realized through integrating bifunctional properties and tuning the synergistic effect. Herein, dual&#8208;single&#8208;atoms supported on conjugated porous carbon nitride polymer are developed for effective photocatalytic CO2 reduction, featuring the function of cobalt (Co) and ruthenium (Ru). A series of in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations are conducted for quantitative analysis of structure&#8211;performance correlation. It is concluded that the active Co sites facilitate dynamic charge transfer, while the Ru sites promote selective CO2 surface&#8208;bound interaction during CO2 photoreduction. The combination of atom&#8208;specific traits and the synergy between Co and Ru lead to the high photocatalytic CO2 conversion with corresponding apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 2.8% at 385&#160;nm, along with a high turnover number (TON) of more than 200 without addition of any sacrificial agent. This work presents an example of identifying the roles of different single&#8208;atom metals and regulating the synergy, where the two metals with unique properties collaborate to further boost the photocatalytic performance.

         <title>Towards High Performance Li&#8211;S Batteries via Sulfonate&#8208;Rich COF&#8208;Modified Separator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An all&#8208;in&#8208;one strategy of sulfonate&#8208;rich COF&#8208;modified separator is proposed for Li&#8211;S batteries, which provides a solution for tackling the issues of polysulfide shuttling and dendrite growth simultaneously. Benefiting from the chemical merits of strong electronegativity and large interlayer spacing for SCOF&#8208;2, the capacity and stability of rechargeable Li&#8211;S batteries are greatly improved.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries are held great promise for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density devices; however, polysulfide shuttle and Li&#8208;dendrite growth severely hinders their commercial production. Herein, a sulfonate&#8208;rich COF (SCOF&#8208;2) is designed, synthesized, and used to modify the separator of Li&#8211;S batteries, providing a solution for the above challenges. It is found that the SCOF&#8208;2 features stronger electronegativity and larger interlayer spacing than that of none/monosulfonate COFs, which can facilitate the Li+ migration and alleviate the formation of Li&#8208;dendrites. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and in situ Raman analysis demonstrate that the SCOF&#8208;2 possesses a narrow bandgap and strong interaction on sulfur species, thereby suppressing self&#8208;discharge behavior. As a result, the modified batteries deliver an ultralow attenuation rate of 0.047% per cycle over 800 cycles at 1 C, and excellent anti&#8208;self&#8208;discharge performance by a low&#8208;capacity attenuation of 6.0% over one week. Additionally, even with the high&#8208;sulfur&#8208;loading cathode (3.2&#8211;8.2 mgs cm&#8208;2) and lean electrolyte (5&#160;&#181;L&#160;mgs&#8208;1), the batteries still exhibit &#8776;80% capacity retention over 100 cycles, showing great potential for practical application.

         <title>Self&#8208;Powered InP Nanowire Photodetector for Single&#8208;Photon Level Detection at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;powered InP nanowire array photodetector is reported that can achieve single&#8208;photon level light detection at room temperature without an external bias. This is enabled by an optimized radial p&#8208;n heterojunction nanowire array design to realize near&#8208;ideal broadband absorption, extremely low dark current, and highly efficient charge carrier separation.








Abstract
Highly sensitive photodetectors with single&#8208;photon level detection are one of the key components to a range of emerging technologies, in particular the ever&#8208;growing field of optical communication, remote sensing, and quantum computing. Currently, most of the single&#8208;photon detection technologies require external biasing at high voltages and/or cooling to low temperatures, posing great limitations for wider applications. Here, InP nanowire array photodetectors that can achieve single&#8208;photon level light detection at room temperature without an external bias are demonstrated. Top&#8208;down etched, heavily doped p&#8208;type InP nanowires and n&#8208;type aluminium&#8208;doped zinc oxide (AZO)/zinc oxide (ZnO) carrier&#8208;selective contact are used to form a radial p&#8211;n junction with a built&#8208;in electric field exceeding 3 &#215; 105&#160;V cm&#8722;1&#160;at 0&#160;V. The device exhibits broadband light sensitivity and can distinguish a single photon per pulse from the dark noise at 0&#160;V, enabled by its design to realize near&#8208;ideal broadband absorption, extremely low dark current, and highly efficient charge carrier separation. Meanwhile, the bandwidth of the device reaches above 600&#160;MHz with a timing jitter of 538&#160;ps. The proposed device design provides a new pathway toward low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;sensitivity, self&#8208;powered photodetectors for numerous future applications.

         <title>Silk microneedle patch capable of on&#8208;demand multi&#8208;drug delivery to the brain for glioblastoma treatment</title>

Abstract
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor, and it is associated with poor prognosis because of invasive growth. To date, surgery followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy remains the standard treatment strategy for GBM after the exact location of the tumor has been confirmed. However, challenges still exist for many GBM patients when surgery is difficult or impossible; in many cases, surgery cannot remove the tumor completely, because the tumor tends to spread into surrounding tissues. Herein, we report the design, fabrication and application of a heterogenous silk fibroin microneedle (SMN) patch for circumventing the blood&#8208;brain barrier and releasing multiple drugs directly to the tumor site for drug combination treatment. The biocompatible and biodegradable SMN patch can dissolve slowly over time, allowing the sustained release of multiple drugs at different concentrations over an extended period of time. Furthermore, it can be triggered remotely to induce rapid drug delivery at a designated stage after implantation. In the GBM mouse models with and without tumor resection in distinct cell lines, two clinically relevant chemotherapeutic agents(thrombin and temozolomide)and targeted drug (bevacizumab) were loaded into the SMN patch at different doses and with individually controlled release profiles. The drugs were spatiotemporally and sequentially delivered to the tumor site in the mouse brain during the dissolution of the SMN patch and maintained at levels above those effective for hemostasis, anti&#8208;angiogenesis and apoptosis of tumor cells. Device application was non&#8208;toxic and resulted in both decreased tumor volume and increased survival rate in mice. The SMN patch with on&#8208;demand multi&#8208;drug delivery has potential applications for the combined administration of multiple therapeutic drugs for the clinical treatment of brain tumors when other methods are insufficient.

         <title>Controllable SiOx Nanorod Memristive Neuron for Probabilistic Bayesian Inference</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Modern artificial neural network technology using a deterministic computing framework is faced with a critical challenge in dealing with massive genuine data that are largely unstructured and ambiguous. This challenge demands the advances of an elementary physical device for tackling the uncertainties inherent to natural data, which can be a stepping stone for realizing probabilistic neural networks. Here, we designed and fabricated a SiOx nanorod memristive device by employing the glancing angle deposition (GLAD) technique, suggesting a controllable stochastic artificial neuron that can mimic the fundamental integrate&#8208;and&#8208;fire signaling and stochastic dynamics of a biological neuron. The SiOx nanorod structure provides the random distribution of multiple nanopores all across the active area, capable of forming a multitude of Si switching filaments at many SiOx nanorod edges after the electromigration process, leading to a stochastic switching event with a very high dynamic range (up to &#8764;5.15 &#215; 1010) and low energy (up to &#8764; 4.06 pJ) for firing. Different probabilistic activation (ProbAct) functions in a sigmoid form are implemented, showing its controllability with low variation by manufacturing and electrical programming schemes. Furthermore, as an application prospect, based on the suggested memristive neuron, we demonstrated the self&#8208;resting neural operation with the local circuit configuration and revealed probabilistic Bayesian inferences for genetic regulatory networks with low normalized mean squared errors (&lt; &#8764;2.41 &#215; 10&#8722;2) and its robustness to the ProbAct variation.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Driven Biomaterials Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The advancement of machine learning (ML) in materials science has progressed in leaps and bounds and has made a big impact into biomaterials research, ranging from discovery of bioactive chemical moieties, screening and optimization of material properties, to developing materials that interface better with biological systems. There is still untapped potential to integrate with ML for the next frontier in biomaterials.








Abstract
Biomaterials is an exciting and dynamic field, which uses a collection of diverse materials to achieve desired biological responses. While there is constant evolution and innovation in materials with time, biomaterials research has been hampered by the relatively long development period required. In recent years, driven by the need to accelerate materials development, the applications of machine learning in materials science has progressed in leaps and bounds. The combination of machine learning with high&#8208;throughput theoretical predictions and high&#8208;throughput experiments (HTE) has shifted the traditional Edisonian (trial and error) paradigm to a data&#8208;driven paradigm. In this review, each type of biomaterial and their key properties and use cases are systematically discussed, followed by how machine learning can be applied in the development and design process. The discussions are classified according to various types of materials used including polymers, metals, ceramics, and nanomaterials, and implants using additive manufacturing. Last, the current gaps and potential of machine learning to further aid biomaterials discovery and application are also discussed.

         <title>High&#8208;Specificity In Vivo Tumor Imaging Using Bioorthogonal NIR&#8208;IIb Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioorthogonal lanthanide&#8208;based nanoprobes are developed for deep&#8208;tissue NIR&#8208;IIb imaging and MRI with high tumor&#8208;targeting specificity. These bioorthogonal nanoprobes offer a 20&#8208;fold increase in the NIR&#8208;IIb imaging signal and a 2&#8208;fold increase in the MRI signal, compared with non&#8208;orthogonal probes.








Abstract
Lanthanide&#8208;based NIR&#8208;IIb nanoprobes are ideal for in vivo imaging. However, existing NIR&#8208;IIb nanoprobes often suffer from low tumor&#8208;targeting specificity, limiting their widespread use. Here the application of bioorthogonal nanoprobes with high tumor&#8208;targeting specificity for in vivo NIR&#8208;IIb luminescence imaging and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is reported. These dual&#8208;modality nanoprobes can enhance NIR&#8208;IIb emission by 20&#8208;fold and MRI signal by twofold, compared with non&#8208;bioorthogonal nanoprobes in murine subcutaneous tumors. Moreover, these bioorthogonal probes enable orthotopic brain tumor imaging. Implementation of bio&#8208;orthogonal chemistry significantly reduces the nanoprobe dose and hence cytotoxicity, providing a paradigm for real&#8208;time in vivo visualization of tumors.

Abstract
Solution&#8208;based thin&#8208;film solidification is a complex process involving various transport phenomena that are intricately dependent on multiple experimental parameters. The difficulty of analyzing this process experimentally or conducting exact numerical simulation make it challenging to understand, predict, and control the solidification process. In this work, we propose a simple and effective technique to analyze the thin&#8208;film solidification process during solution shearing, based on 3D geometrical model of the meniscus. The 3D meniscus geometry, which changes depending on the experimental parameters, was attained using high&#8208;speed side&#8208;view and top&#8208;view in situ microscopy. Thereafter, mass and momentum transport mathematical models were applied to obtain numerical solutions of transport phenomena within the meniscus. Utilizing these results, the underlying mechanism of dendritic growth of small molecule organic semiconductor was elucidated, which has previously been unknown. The 3D meniscus modeling was particularly important for this analysis, as dendrite formation is strongly dependent on the meniscus geometry near the contact line and mass transport variation perpendicular to the coating direction. Our technique enables the study of complex relationship between experimental parameters and solidification process, which is widely applicable to various materials and coating systems; whereby, better understanding of thin&#8208;film growth and device performance optimization is possible.

         <title>Gas&#8208;Phase Fluorination of Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has received much attention in recent years as a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) dielectric material with potential applications ranging from catalysts to electronics. hBN is a stable covalent compound with a planar hexagonal lattice and is relatively unreactive to most chemical environments, making the chemical functionalization of hBN challenging. Here, we report a simple, scalable strategy to fluorinate hBN using a direct gas&#8208;phase fluorination technique. The nature of fluorine bonding to the hBN lattice and their chemical coordination are described based on various characterization studies and theoretical models. The fluorine functionalized hBN shows a bandgap reduction and displays a semiconducting behavior due to the fluorination process. Additionally, the fluorinated hBN shows significant improvement in its thermal and friction properties, which could be substantial in applications such as lubricants and thermal fluids. Theory and simulations reveal that the enhanced friction properties of fluorinated hBN result from reduced inter&#8208;planar interaction energy by electrostatic repulsion of intercalated fluorine atoms between hBN layers without significant disruption of the in&#8208;plane lattice. This technique paves the way for the fluorination of several other 2D structures for various applications such as magnetism and functional nanoscale electronic devices.

         <title>Insights into Redox Processes and Correlated Performance of Organic Carbonyl Electrode Materials in Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic carbonyl compounds have been considered as promising electrode materials for high&#8208;performance rechargeable batteries. However, their redox processes and performance need to be fully understood. An in&#8208;depth understanding on redox processes and the correlated electrochemical performance of organic carbonyl electrode materials is provided, with the aim of promoting their practical applications in the foreseeable future.








Abstract
Organic carbonyl electrode materials have shown great prospects for rechargeable batteries in view of their high capacity, flexible designability, and sustainable production. However, organic carbonyl electrode materials still suffer from unsatisfactory electrochemical performance, which is highly relevant to their redox processes. Herein, an in&#8208;depth understanding on redox processes and the correlated electrochemical performance of organic carbonyl electrode materials is provided. The redox processes discussed mainly involve molecular structure evolution (intermediates), crystal structure evolution (phase transition), and charge storage mechanisms. The properties of intermediates can affect voltage, cycling stability, reversible capacity, and rate performance of batteries. Moreover, the reversible capacity/cycling stability and rate performance would be also influenced by phase transition and charge storage mechanisms (diffusion&#8208; or surface&#8208;controlled), respectively. To accelerate the practical applications of organic carbonyl electrode materials, future work should focus on developing more in situ or operando characterization techniques and further understanding the intrinsic relationships between redox processes and performance. It is hoped that the work discussed herein will stimulate more attention to the detailed redox processes and their correlations with the performance of organic carbonyl electrode materials in rechargeable batteries.

         <title>Simultaneously blocking chemical crosstalk and internal short circuit via gel&#8208;stretching derived nanoporous non&#8208;shrinkage separator for safe lithium&#8208;ion batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Separator, an ionic permeable and electronic insulating membrane between cathode and anode, plays a crucial role in the electrochemical and safety performance of batteries. However, the commercial polyolefin separators not only suffer from inevitable thermal shrinkage at elevated temperature, but also fail to inhibit the hidden chemical crosstalk of reactive gases such as O2, leading to often reported thermal runaway (TR) and hence preventing large&#8208;scale implementation of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, a nanoporous non&#8208;shrinkage separator (GS&#8208;PI) was fabricated via a novel gel&#8208;stretching orientation approach to eliminate TR. In situ synchrotron small angle X&#8208;ray scattering during heating clearly showed that the as&#8208;prepared thin GS&#8208;PI separator exhibits superior mechanical tolerance at high temperature, thus effectively preventing internal short circuit. Meanwhile, the unique nanoporous structure design further blocks chemical crosstalk and the associated exothermic reactions. Accelerating Rate Calorimetry test revealed that the practical 1 Ah LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 (NCM622)/graphite pouch cell using GS&#8208;PI nanoporous separator show a maximum temperature rise (dT/dtmax) of only 3.7&#160;&#176;C s&#8722;1 compared to 131.6&#160;&#176;C s&#8722;1 in the case of Al2O3@PE macroporous separator. Moreover, despite the reduced pore size, the GS&#8208;PI separator demonstrates better cycling stability than conventional Al2O3@PE separator at high temperature without sacrificing specific capacity and rate capability.

         <title>Ultrarobust and High&#8208;Performance Rotational Hydrodynamic Triboelectric Nanogenerator Enabled by Automatic Mode Switch and Charge Excitation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is an emerging technology for the ambient mechanical energy harvesting, which provides a possibility to realize the wild environment monitor by self&#8208;powered sensing systems. However, TENG is limited in some practical applications as a result of low output performance (low charge density) and mechanical durability (material abrasion). Herein, an ultrarobust and high&#8208;performance rotational TENG enabled by automatic mode switch (contact mode in low speed and non&#8208;contact in high speed) and charge excitation is proposed. It displays excellent stability maintaining 94% electrical output after 72,000 cycles, much higher than that of the normal contact mode TENG (30%). Due to its high electrical stability and large electrical output, this TENG powers 944 green LEDs to brightness in series. Furthermore, by harvesting the water flow energy, various commercial capacitors can be charged fast, and the self&#8208;powered fire alarm, and self&#8208;powered temperature and humidity detection are realized. This work provides an ideal scheme for enhancing the mechanical durability, broadening the range of working frequency and improving the electrical output of TENG. In addition, the high performance hydrodynamic triboelectric nanogenerator demonstrated in this work would have great applications for Internet of Things in remote area.

However, TENG is limited in some practical applications as a result of low output performance (low charge density) and mechanical durability (material abrasion). Herein, an ultrarobust and high-performance rotational TENG enabled by automatic mode switch (contact mode in low speed and non-contact in high speed) and charge excitation is proposed. It displays excellent stability maintaining 94% electrical output after 72,000 cycles, much higher than that of the normal contact mode TENG (30%). Due to its high electrical stability and large electrical output, this TENG powers 944 green LEDs to brightness in series. Furthermore, by harvesting the water flow energy, various commercial capacitors can be charged fast, and the self-powered fire alarm, and self-powered temperature and humidity detection are realized. This work provides an ideal scheme for enhancing the mechanical durability, broadening the range of working frequency and improving the electrical output of TENG. In addition, the high performance hydrodynamic triboelectric nanogenerator demonstrated in this work would have great applications for Internet of Things in remote area.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Interfacial Manipulation via In Situ Grown ZnSe Cultivator toward Highly Reversible Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Zn metal anode has garnered growing scientific and industrial interest owing to its appropriate redox potential, low cost and high safety. Nevertheless, the instability of Zn anode caused by dendrite formation, hydrogen evolution and side reactions has greatly hampered its commercialization. Herein, an in situ grown ZnSe overlayer is crafted over one side of commercial Zn foil via chemical vapor deposition in a scalable manner, aiming to achieve optimized electrolyte/Zn interfaces with large&#8208;scale viability. Impressively, thus&#8208;derived ZnSe coating functions as a cultivator to guide oriented growth of Zn (002) plane at the infancy stage of stripping/plating cycles, thereby inhibiting the formation of Zn dendrites and the occurrence of side reactions. As a result, high cyclic stability (1530 h at 1.0&#160;mA cm&#8211;2/1.0 mAh cm&#8722;2; 172 h at 30.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2/10.0 mAh cm&#8722;2) in symmetric cells is harvested. Meanwhile, when paired with V2O5 based cathode, assembled full cell achieves an outstanding capacity (194.5 mAh g&#8211;1) and elongated lifespan (a capacity retention of 84% after 1000 cycles) at 5.0 A g&#8211;1. Our reversible Zn anode enabled by the interfacial manipulation strategy via ZnSe cultivator is anticipated to satisfy the demand of commercial use.

         <title>Engineering Polysaccharide&#8208;Based Hydrogel Photonic Constructs: From Multiscale Detection to the Biofabrication of Living Optical Fibers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polysaccharide&#8208;based, multilayered hydrogel fibers in the photonics arena are explored. Natural ionic&#8208;crosslinking hydrogels are leveraged for developing a hydrogel fiber fusion splicing method and combined with nanoplasmonic&#8208;based photonics for detecting biotargets such as SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. The integration of living entities in the cytocompatible light&#8208;guiding core enables the digitalization and quantification of complex 3D biological events, such as cancer invasive proliferation.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state optics has been the pillar of modern digital age. Integrating soft hydrogel materials with micro/nanooptics could expand the horizons of photonics for bioengineering. Here, wet&#8208;spun multilayer hydrogel fibers are engineered through ionic&#8208;crosslinked natural polysaccharides that serve as multifunctional platforms. The resulting flexible hydrogel structure and reversible crosslinking provide tunable design properties such as adjustable refractive index and fusion splicing. Modulation of the optical readout via physical stimuli, including shape, compression, and multiple optical inputs/outputs is demonstrated. The unique permeability of the hydrogels is also combined with plasmonic nanoparticles for molecular detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 in fiber&#8208;coupled biomedical swabs. A tricoaxial 3D printing nozzle is then employed for the continuous fabrication of living optical fibers. Light interaction with living cells enables the quantification and digitalization of complex biological phenomena such as 3D cancer progression and drug susceptibility. These fibers pave the way for advances in biomaterial&#8208;based photonics and biosensing platforms.

Organic single crystals based on 9,10&#8208;bis([N,N&#8208;diphenyl]&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;phenylethynyl)anthracene (TPA&#8208;An) and 9,10&#8208;bis([1&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;diphenyl]&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;phenylethynyl)anthracene (TBA&#8208;An) exhibit high photoluminescence quantum yields close to 100% and ultrahigh hole mobilities of 0.45 and 0.15&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 in single&#8208;crystal organic field&#8208;effect transistors.Simultaneously, the TPA&#8208;An&#8208;based and TBA&#8208;An&#8208;based single&#8208;crystal phototransistors have ultrahigh sensitive to 370&#160;nm UV light.








Abstract
Organic single crystals with excellent optical and electrical properties are critical for the development of organic optoelectronics. Herein, two compounds 9,10&#8208;bis([N,N&#8208;diphenyl]&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;phenylethynyl)anthracene (TPA&#8208;An) and 9,10&#8208;bis([1&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;diphenyl]&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;phenylethynyl)anthracene (TBA&#8208;An) are synthesized by introducing two different luminescent groups, triphenylamine and 1,3&#8208;diphenylbenzene, at the 9,10 positions of anthracene via triple bond connection. Single crystals based on TPA&#8208;An and TBA&#8208;An with a ribbon morphology obtained through the slow solvent&#8208;evaporation method exhibit high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of 98% and 99% at room temperature, and remarkable hole mobilities of 0.45 and 0.15 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 in single&#8208;crystal organic field&#8208;effect transistors (SC&#8208;OFETs). Furthermore, UV phototransistors based on the two single crystals obtain photosensitivities of 1.03 &#215; 103 and 3.45 &#215; 104, ultrahigh photoresponsivities of 7.19 &#215; 105 and 1.50&#160;&#215; 105 A W&#8722;1, and the detectivities exceeding 1.40 &#215; 1016 and 1.60 &#215; 1017 Jones.

         <title>Photocatalytic Z&#8208;Scheme Overall Water Splitting: Recent Advances in Theory and Experiments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solar&#8208;driven water splitting has attracted substantial attention over the past decades as it not only provides a clean and sustainable fuel but also promises to dramatically reduce CO2 emissions. The utmost possible form of artificial photosynthesis is a two&#8208;step photoexcitation known as &#8220;Z&#8208;scheme&#8221;, which mimics the natural photosystem, and considerably enhances the stability and efficiency of overall water splitting.








Abstract
Photocatalytic water splitting is considered one of the most important and appealing approaches for the production of green H2 to address the global energy demand. The utmost possible form of artificial photosynthesis is a two&#8208;step photoexcitation known as &#8220;Z&#8208;scheme&#8221;, which mimics the natural photosystem. This process solely relies on the effective coupling and suitable band positions of semiconductors (SCs) and redox mediators for the purpose to catalyze the surface chemical reactions and significantly deter the backward reaction. In recent years, the Z&#8208;scheme strategies and their key role have been studied progressively through experimental approaches. In addition, theoretical studies based on density functional theory have provided detailed insight into the mechanistic aspects of some breathtakingly complex problems associated with hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction. In this context, this critical review gives an overview of the fundamentals of Z&#8208;scheme photocatalysis, including both theoretical and experimental advancements in the field of photocatalytic water splitting, and suggests future perspectives.

         <title>Interactions of Metal Nanoclusters with Light: Fundamentals and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal nanoclusters have recently emerged as a promising class of optical materials. How they interact with light is a key consideration in the design of high&#8208;quality optical materials based on nanoclusters. The basic principles of the interactions between light and nanoclusters and highlights their optical applications are discussed.








Abstract
The interactions of materials with light determine their applications in various fields. In the past decade, ultrasmall metal nanoclusters (NCs) have emerged as a promising class of optical materials due to their unique molecular&#8208;like properties. Herein, the basic principles of optical absorption and photoluminescence of metal NCs, their interactions with polarized light, and light&#8208;induced chemical reactions, are discussed, highlighting the roles of the core and protecting ligands/motifs of metal NCs in their interactions with light. The metal core and protecting ligands/motifs determine the electronic structures of metal NCs, which are closely related to their optical properties. In addition, the protecting ligands/motifs of metal NCs contribute to their photoluminescence and chiral origin, further promoting the interactions of metal NCs with light through various pathways. The fundamentals of light&#8211;NC interactions provide guidance for the design of metal NCs in optical applications, which are discussed in the second part. In the last section, some strategies are proposed to further understand light&#8211;NC interactions, highlighting the challenges and opportunities. It is hoped that this work will stimulate more research on the optical properties of metal NCs and their applications in various fields.

         <title>Photoinduced Halide Segregation in Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper 2D Mixed Halide Perovskite Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D mixed halide perovskites with bandgap tunability and increased stability are employed in photovoltaics, light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), and optoelectronics. Inherent halide ion mobility (instability) of mixed halides drives photoinduced halide ion segregation. The important role of dimensionality across 3D to 2D perovskites governs the excited&#8208;state dynamics and the kinetics of halide segregation and dark recovery.








Abstract
2D lead halide perovskites, which exhibit bandgap tunability and increased chemical stability, have been found to be useful for designing optoelectronic devices. Reducing dimensionality with decreasing number of layers (n&#160;=&#160;10&#8211;1) also imparts resistance to light&#8208;induced ion migration as seen from the halide ion segregation and dark recovery in mixed halide (Br:I&#160;=&#160;50:50) perovskite films. The light&#8208;induced halide ion segregation efficiency, as determined from difference absorbance spectra, decreases from 20% to &lt;1%&#160;as the dimensionality is decreased for 2D perovskite film from n&#160;=&#160;10 to 1. The segregation rate constant (ksegregation), which decreases from 5.9&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3&#160;s&#8722;1 (n&#160;=&#160;10) to 3.6&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4&#160;s&#8722;1 (n&#160;=&#160;1), correlates well with nearly an order of magnitude decrease observed in charge&#8208;carrier lifetime (&#964;average&#160;=&#160;233&#160;ps for n&#160;=&#160;10&#160;vs &#964;avg&#160;=&#160;27&#160;ps for n&#160;=&#160;1). The tightly bound excitons in 2D perovskites make charge separation less probable, which in turn decreases the halide mobility and resulting phase segregation. The importance of controlling the dimensionality of the 2D architecture in suppressing halide ion mobility is discussed.

         <title>Ultrafast Thermal Imprinting of Plasmonic Hotspots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Plasmonic heating ordinarily leads to isotropic heating of the material. However, through nanoparticle shaping, pulsed illumination, and the right choice of material (e.g., HfN), plasmonic absorption hotspots can be directly imprinted on the lattice as heat. This approach results in extreme thermal hotspots, lasting hundreds of ps, which can boost the chemical reactivity of catalytic nanoreactors by orders of magnitude.








Abstract
Plasmonic photochemistry is driven by a rich collection of near&#8208;field, hot charge carrier, energy transfer, and thermal effects, most often accomplished by continuous wave illumination. Heat generation is usually considered undesirable, because noble metal nanoparticles heat up isotropically, losing the extreme energy confinement of the optical resonance. Here it is demonstrated through optical and heat&#8208;transfer modelling that the judicious choice of nanoreactor geometry and material enables the direct thermal imprint of plasmonic optical absorption hotspots onto the lattice with high fidelity. Transition metal nitrides (TMNs, e.g., TiN/HfN) embody the ideal material requirements, where ultrafast electron&#8211;phonon coupling prevents fast electronic heat dissipation and low thermal conductivity prolongs the heat confinement. The extreme energy confinement leads to unprecedented peak temperatures and internal heat gradients (&gt;10 K nm&#8722;1) that cannot be achieved using noble metals or any current heating method. TMN nanoreactors consequently yield up to ten thousand times more product in pulsed photothermal chemical conversion compared with noble metals (Ag, Au, Cu). These findings open up a completely unexplored realm of nano&#8208;photochemistry, where adjacent reaction centers experience substantially different temperatures for hundreds of picoseconds, long enough for bond breaking to occur.

         <title>Cycloruthenated Self&#8208;Assembly with Metabolic Inhibition to Efficiently Overcome Multidrug Resistance in Cancers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In this study we report the synthesis and the evaluation of the efficacy of a cycloruthenated complex, RuZ, to overcome multi&#8208;drug resistance (MDR) in cancer cells. RuZ could self&#8208;assemble into nanoaggregates in the cell culture medium and resulted in a high intracellular concentration of RuZ in MDR cancer cells. The self&#8208;assembly significantly decreased oxygen consumption and inhibited glycolysis, which decreased cellular ATP levels. The reduction in ATP levels and its low affinity for the ABCB1 and ABCG2 transporters (which mediate MDR) significantly increased the retention of RuZ by MDR cancer cells. Furthermore, RuZ increased cellular oxidative stress, inducing DNA damage, and in combination with the aforementioned effects of RuZ, increased the apoptosis of cancer cells. Proteomic profiling analysis suggested that the RuZ primarily decreased the expression of proteins that mediate glycolysis and aerobic mitochondrial respiration and increased the expression of proteins involved in apoptosis. RuZ inhibited the proliferation of 35 cancer cell lines, of which 7 cell lines were resistant to clinical drugs. It was also active in doxorubicin&#8208;resistant MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231/Adr mouse tumor xenograft. To the best of our knowledge, our results are the first to show that self&#8208;assembled cycloruthenated complexes are efficacious in inhibiting the growth of MDR cancer cells.

         <title>2D Cu9S5/PtS2/WSe2 Double Heterojunction Bipolar Transistor with High Current Gain</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Bipolar junction transistor (BJT), one important circuit element in the integrated circuits, is now widely used in high&#8208;speed computation and communication for its capability of high&#8208;power signal amplification. 2D materials and their heterostructures are promising in building high&#8208;amplification and high&#8208;frequency BJTs because they can be naturally thin and highly designable in tailoring components properties. However, currently the low emitter injection efficiency results in only moderate current gain achieved in the pioneer researches, severely restraining its future development. Herein, we show an elaborately designed double heterojunction bipolar transistor (DHBT) can greatly promote the injection efficiency, improving the current gain by order of magnitude. In this DHBT we use high&#8208;doping&#8208;density wide&#8208;bandgap 2D Cu9S5 as emitter and narrow&#8208;bandgap PtS2 as base. This heterostructure efficiently suppress the current ratio of reverse electron flux from base and increase the injection efficiency. By exploiting this high injection efficiency, our DHBT experimentally achieves an excellent common&#8208;base current gain (&#945; = ~0.996) and common&#8208;emitter current gain (&#946; = ~910). This work systematically explores the electrical behavior of 2D materials based DHBT, and provides deep insight of the architecture design for building high gain DHBT, which may promote the applications of 2D&#8208;materials based heterojunctions in the fields of integrated circuits.

         <title>Mesenchymal Stem Cell&#8208;derived Extracellular Vesicles with High PD&#8208;L1 Expression for Autoimmune Diseases Treatment</title>

Abstract
Autoimmune diseases are the third most common disease influencing the quality of life of many patients. Here, we develop a PD&#8208;L1+ mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) derived extracellular vesicles (MSC&#8208;sEVs&#8208;PD&#8208;L1) using lentivirus&#8208;mediated gene transfection technology for reconfiguration of the local immune microenvironment of affected tissue in autoimmune diseases. MSC&#8208;sEVs&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 exhibits an impressive ability to regulate various activated immune cells to an immunosuppressed state in vitro. More importantly, in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)&#8208;induced ulcerative colitis (UC) and imiquimod&#8208;induced psoriasis mouse models, we observe a significantly high accumulation of MSC&#8208;sEVs&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 in the inflamed tissues compared to the PD&#8208;L1+ MSCs. Therapeutic efficiency in both UC and psoriasis mouse disease models is demonstrated using MSC&#8208;sEVs&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 to reshape the inflammatory ecosystem in the local immune context. We develop a technology using MSC&#8208;sEVs&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 as a natural delivery platform for autoimmune diseases treatment with high clinical potential.

         <title>Liquid metal&#8208;enabled Mechanical energy&#8208;induced CO2 Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
We report a green carbon capture and conversion technology offering scalability and economic viability for mitigating CO2 emissions. The technology uses suspensions of gallium liquid metal to reduce CO2 into carbonaceous solid products and O2 at near room temperature. The nonpolar nature of the liquid gallium interface allows the solid products to instantaneously exfoliate, hence keeping active sites accessible. The solid co&#8208;contributor of silver&#8208;gallium rods ensures a cyclic sustainable process. The overall process relies on mechanical energy as the input, which drives nano dimensional triboelectrochemical reactions. When a gallium/silver fluoride mix at 7:1 mass ratio is employed to create the reaction material, 92% efficiency was obtained at the remarkably low input energy of 230 kW&#8729;h for the capture and conversion of a tonne of CO2. This green technology presents an economical solution for CO2 emissions.

         <title>Design Quasi&#8208;MOF Nanospheres as Dynamic Electrocatalyst toward Accelerated Sulfur Reduction Reaction for High Performance Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Lithium sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries have been considered as one of the most promising next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries owing to its high energy density and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, the sluggish kinetics of the sulfur reduction reaction process, which is so far insufficiently explored, still impedes its practical application.&#160;Metal organic frameworks (MOF) are widely investigated as&#160;sulfur immobilizer, but the interactions and catalytic activity of lithium polysulfides (LiPs) on metal nodes are weak due to the presence of organic ligands. Herein, we present a strategy to design Quasi&#8208;MOF nanospheres, which has a transition&#8208;state structure between MOF and metal oxide, via controlled ligand exchange strategy to serve as sulfur electrocatalyst. The Quasi&#8208;MOF not only inherits the porous structure of MOF, but also exposes abundant metal nodes to act as active sites, rendering strong LiPs absorbability. The reversible deligandation/ligandation of Quasi&#8208;MOF and its impact on the durability of catalyst over the course of electrochemical process has been acknowledged, which confers a remarkable catalytic activity. Attributed to these structural advantages, Quasi&#8208;MOF delivers a decent discharge capacity and low capacity fading rate over long&#8208;term cycling. This work not only offers insight into the rational design of Quasi&#8208;MOF based composite, but also provides guidance for the application in Li&#8208;S batteries.

         <title>Conversion&#8208;type Non&#8208;metal Elemental Tellurium Anode with High Utilization for Mild/alkaline Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Zinc ion batteries (ZIBs), generally established on an excessive metallic Zn anode and aqueous electrolytes, suffer from severe dendrites and gassing issues at Zn side, resulting in poor cycling life. Substituting Zn metal anode with non&#8208;Zn ones is a promising strategy for solving these problems, whereas this is still restricted by the limited anode alternatives. Herein, by replacing metal Zn with chalcogen element tellurium (Te), we reported a conversion&#8208;type Te based ZIB that can work in both mild and alkaline electrolytes. As expected, the as&#8208;assembled mild Te/MnO2 and alkaline Te/Ni(OH)2 cells deliver remarkable capacities up to 106 and 161 mAh g&#8211;1anode+cathode, respectively, with a high utilization of anode (50.1% for the Te/MnO2 and 38.9% for the Te/Ni(OH)2), which surpass all ZIBs. Ultra&#8208;long cycling life (over 75% capacity retention after 5000 cycles) was achieved in the two systems, benefiting from the stable conversion mechanisms (mild: Te to ZnTe2 to ZnTe; alkaline: ZnTe to Te to TeO2) with thoroughly eliminated dendrites and gassing. Moreover, high gravimetric energy density of ZIBs was also achieved, which are 176.3&#160;Wh kg&#8211;1anode+cathdoe (Te/Ni(OH)2) and 81&#160;Wh Kg&#8211;1anode+cathode (Te/MnO2), respectively. This work sheds light on the development of advanced conversion&#8208;type anode for high&#8208;performance batteries with superior stability.

         <title>Viologen&#8208;Immobilized Two&#8208;Dimensional Polymer Film Enabling Highly Efficient Electrochromic Device for Solar&#8208;Powered Smart Window</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Electrochromic devices (ECDs) have emerged as a unique class of optoelectronic devices for the development of smart windows. However, current ECDs typically suffer from low coloration efficiency (CE) and high energy consumption, which have thus hindered their practical applications, especially as components in solar&#8208;powered EC windows. Here, we demonstrate the high&#8208;performance ECDs with a fully crystalline viologen&#8208;immobilized 2D polymer (V2DP) thin film as the color&#8208;switching layer. The high density of vertically oriented pore channels (pore size, &#8764;4.5&#160;nm; pore density, &#8764;5.8 &#215; 1016 m&#8722;2) in the synthetic V2DP film enables high utilization of redox&#8208;active viologen moieties and benefits for Li+ ion diffusion/transport. As a result, the as&#8208;fabricated ECDs achieve a rapid switching speed (coloration, 2.8 s; bleaching, 1.2 s), and a high CE (989 cm2 C&#8722;1), and low energy consumption (21.1 &#956;W cm&#8722;2). Moreover, we manage to fabricate transmission&#8208;tunable, self&#8208;sustainable EC window prototypes by vertically integrating the V2DP ECDs with transparent solar cells. This work sheds light on designing electroactive 2D polymers with molecular precision for optoelectronics and paves a practical route toward developing self&#8208;powered EC windows to offset the electricity consumption of buildings.

         <title>Asymmetric Elimination Reaction on Chiral Metal Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The production of enantiopure materials and molecules is of uttermost relevance in research and industry in numerous contexts, ranging from non&#8208;linear optics to asymmetric synthesis. In the context of the latter, we have investigated dehalogenation, which is an essential reaction step for a broad class of chemical reactions. Specifically, dehalogenation of prochiral 5&#8208;bromo&#8208;7&#8208;methylbenz(a)anthracene (BMA) on prototypical, chiral, intermetallic PdGa{111} surfaces under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. Enantioselective halogen elimination is demonstrated by combining temperature&#8208;programmed x&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning probe microscopy, and density functional theory. On the PdGa{111} surfaces, the difference in debromination temperatures for the two BMA surface enantiomers amounts up to unprecedented 46 K. The significant dependence of the dehalogenation temperature of the BMA surface enantiomers on the atomic termination of the PdGa{111} surfaces, implies that the ensemble effect is pronounced in this reaction step. These findings evidence enantiospecific control and hence promote intrinsically chiral crystals for asymmetric on&#8208;surface synthesis.

         <title>Dense Silicon Nanowire Networks Grown on a Stainless Steel Fiber Cloth: A Flexible and Robust Anode for Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Silicon nanowires (Si NWs) have great promise as an anode material for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) due to their very high specific capacity. Achieving adequate mass loadings for binder&#8211;free Si NWs have been restricted by low surface area, mechanically unstable and poorly conductive current collectors (CC), as well as complicated and expensive fabrication routes. Herein, we report a tunable mass loading and dense Si NW growth on a highly conductive, flexible, fire&#8208;resistant and mechanically robust interwoven stainless steel fiber cloth (SSFC) using a simple glassware setup. The SSFC CC facilitates dense growth of Si NWs where its open structure allows a buffer space for expansion/contraction during Li&#8211;cycling. The Si NWs@SSFC anode displays a stable performance for 500 cycles with an average Coulombic efficiency of more than 99.5%. Galvanostatic cycling of the Si NWs@SSFC anode with a mass loading of 1.32&#160;mg.cm&#8211;2 achieves a stable areal capacity of &#8764;2 mAh.cm&#8211;2 at 0.2C after 200 cycles. Si NWs@SSFC anodes with different mass loadings were characterized before and after cycling by SEM and TEM to examine the effects of Li&#8211;cycling on the morphology. Notably, our approach allows the large&#8211;scale fabrication of robust and flexible binder&#8211;free Si NWs@SSFC architectures, which makes it viable for practical applications in high energy density LIBs.

         <title>Design and Demystify the Lithium Metal Interface towards Highly Reversible Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The reversible lithium (Li) plating/stripping is essentially required for building practical high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries based on Li metal chemistry, which unfortunately remains a severe challenge yet. In this contribution, we demonstrate that through the rational regulation of strong Li+&#8722;anion coordination structures in a highly compatible low&#8208;polarity solvent, 2&#8208;methyl tetrahydrofuran (MeTHF), the Li plating/stripping assisted by a nucleation modulation procedure delivers a remarkably high average Coulombic efficiency (CE) under rather demanding conditions (99.7% and 99.5% under 1.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, 3.0 mAh cm&#8722;2 and 3.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, 3.0 mAh cm&#8722;2, respectively). The exceedingly reversible cycling obtained herein is fundamentally correlated with the flattened Li deposition and minimized SEI generation/reconstruction in the customized condition, which notably restrains the growth rates of both dead Li0 (0.0120 mAh/cycle) and SEI&#8208;Li+ (0.0191 mAh/cycle) during consecutive cycles. Benefiting from the efficient Li plating/stripping manner, the assembled anode&#8208;free Cu|LiFePO4 (2.7 mAh cm&#8722;2) coin and pouch cells exhibit impressive capacity retention of 43.8% and 41.6% after 150 cycles, respectively, albeit no optimization on the test conditions. This work provides guidelines into the targeted interfacial design of high&#8208;efficiency working Li anode, aiming to pave the way for the practical deployment of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li metal batteries.

         <title>Processing of Self&#8208;healing Polymers for Soft Robotics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Soft robots are, due to their softness, inherently safe and adapt well to unstructured environments. However, they are prone to various damage types. Self&#8208;healing polymers address this vulnerability. Self&#8208;healing soft robots can recover completely from macroscopic damage, extending their lifetime. For developing healable soft robots, various formative and additive manufacturing methods have been exploited to shape self&#8208;healing polymers into complex structures. Additionally, several novel manufacturing techniques, noted as (re)assembly binding techniques that are specific to self&#8208;healing polymers, have been created. This paper reviews the wide variety of processing techniques of self&#8208;healing polymers for robotics available in literature, and thoroughly discusses limitations and opportunities. Based on defined requirements for soft robots, these techniques are critically compared and validated. A strong focus is drawn to the reversible covalent and (physico)chemical cross&#8208;links present in the self&#8208;healing polymers that do not only endow healability to the resulting soft robotic components, but are also beneficial in many manufacturing techniques. They solve current obstacles in soft robots, including the formation of robust multi&#8208;material parts, recyclability and stress relaxation. This review bridges two promising research fields, and guides the reader towards selecting a suitable processing method based on a self&#8208;healing polymer and the intended soft robotics&#160;application.

         <title>Compensating electronic effect enables fast site&#8208;to&#8208;site electron transfer over ultrathin RuMn nanosheet branches toward highly electroactive and stable water splitting</title>

Abstract
To improve the electroactivity and stability of electrocatalysts, various modulation strategies have been applied in nanocatalysts. Among different methods, heteroatom doping has been considered as an effective method, which modifies the local bonding environments and the electronic structures. Meanwhile, the design of novel two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanostructures also offers new opportunities for achieving efficient electrocatalysts. In this work, Mn&#8208;doped ultrathin Ru nanosheet branches (RuMn NSBs), a newly reported 2D nanostructure, has been synthesized. With the ultrathin and naturally abundant edges, the RuMn NSBs have exhibited bifunctionalities of hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction with high electroactivity and durability in different electrolytes. Experimental characterizations have revealed that Ru&#8208;O bonds are shortened due to Mn doping, which is the key factor that leads to improved electrochemical performances. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have confirmed that the introduction of Mn enables flexible modulations on the valence states of Ru sites. The inversed redox state evolutions of Ru and Mn sites not only improve the electroactivity for the water splitting but also the long&#8208;term stability due to the pinning effect of Ru sites. This work has provided important inspirations for the design of future advanced Ru&#8208;based electrocatalysts with high performances and durability.

Abstract
The rational design of catalysts&#8217; spatial structure is vitally important to boost the catalytic performance through exposing the active sites, enhancing the mass transfer, and confining the reactants. Herein, a dual&#8208;linker zeolitic tetrazolate framework&#8208;engaged strategy is developed to construct assembled hollow plates (AHP) of N&#8208;rich carbon (NC), which is loaded with single&#8208;Ni atoms to form a highly efficient electrocatalyst (designated as Ni&#8208;NC(AHP)). In the carbonization process, the thermally unstable linker (5&#8208;aminotetrazole) serves as the self&#8208;sacrificial template and the other linker (2&#8208;methylimidazole) mainly serves as the carbon and nitrogen source to form hollow NC matrix. The formed Ni&#8208;NC(AHP) catalyst possesses enhanced mesoporosity and more available surface area, thus promoting mass transport and affording abundant accessible single&#8208;Ni sites. These features contribute to remarkable performance for electrochemical CO2 reduction with exceptionally high selectivity of nearly 100% towards CO in a wide potential range and dramatically enhanced CO partial current density.

         <title>Optoelectronic Properties of Low&#8208;Bandgap Halide Perovskites for Solar Cell Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;bandgap tin&#8208;containing halide perovskites have recently demonstrated impressive photovoltaic performances owing to their unique optoelectronic properties, which are yet to be fully explored. A perspective on the absorption, carrier generation, recombination, and transport phenomena in these materials is provided, underscoring an interesting interplay between doping, defects, and degradation that needs to be controlled for future optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
Riding on the coat tails of rapid developments in single&#8208;junction halide perovskite solar cells, all&#8208;perovskite multijunction solar cells have recently garnered significant attention, with the highest power&#8208;conversion efficiency already reaching 25.6%. Much of this progress has been fueled by the rapid rise in the photovoltaic performance of low&#8208;bandgap halide perovskite absorbers, materials, which, to date, have only been achievable by the partial or complete substitution of lead with tin. However, much room still exists to develop a more critical understanding of key material properties in these low&#8208;bandgap perovskites. Herein, the key optoelectronic properties of absorption, carrier generation, recombination, and transport in these tin&#8208;containing perovskites are discussed, showing that intrinsic doping distinctively impacts many of these properties, thereby rendering this class of halide perovskites unique within the family. Current understanding of the mechanisms that degrade optoelectronic performance in these materials and the corresponding devices are also summarized. These collective results highlight an important interplay between doping, defects, and degradation that will need to be controlled. Finally, the current gaps in understanding of these low&#8208;bandgap perovskites are outlined, thereby providing guidelines for further research, which will unlock their full potential for realizing a plethora of high&#8208;performance optoelectronic devices.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Powered Piezo&#8208;Bioelectric Device Regulates Tendon Repair&#8208;Associated Signaling Pathways through Modulation of Mechanosensitive Ion Channels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under physiological conditions, ion&#8208;channels activity limit membrane depolarization and regulate ion concentration&#8208;dependent signaling cascades. In response to injury or mechanical loading, the activity and expression of the ion&#8208;channels increases, and unspecific tissue&#8208;repair signaling pathways activate, resulting in ectopic calcification. By modulating the mechanosensitive ion&#8208;channels&#8217; expression, electromechanical stimulation regulates specific signaling pathways activation to promote tendon over bone formation processes.








Abstract
Tendon disease constitutes an unmet clinical need and remains a critical challenge in the field of orthopaedic surgery. Innovative solutions are required to overcome the limitations of current tendon grafting approaches, and bioelectronic therapies show promise in treating musculoskeletal diseases, accelerating functional recovery through the activation of tissue regeneration&#8208;specific signaling pathways. Self&#8208;powered bioelectronic devices, particularly piezoelectric materials, represent a paradigm shift in biomedicine, negating the need for battery or external powering and complementing existing mechanotherapy to accelerate the repair processes. Here, the dynamic response of tendon cells to a piezoelectric collagen&#8208;analogue scaffold comprised of aligned nanoscale fibers made of the ferroelectric material poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;trifluoroethylene) is shown. It is demonstrated that motion&#8208;powered electromechanical stimulation of tendon tissue through piezo&#8208;bioelectric device results in ion channel modulation in vitro and regulates specific tissue regeneration signaling pathways. Finally, the potential of the piezo&#8208;bioelectronic device in modulating the progression of tendinopathy&#8208;associated processes in vivo, using a rat Achilles acute injury model is shown. This study indicates that electromechanical stimulation regulates mechanosensitive ion channel sensitivity and promotes tendon&#8208;specific over non&#8208;tenogenic tissue repair processes.

         <title>Electrochemistry&#8208;Induced Improvements of Mechanical Strength, Self&#8208;Healing, and Interfacial Adhesion of Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemistry strategy to enable functional improvements of hydrogels is reported. In comparison with an untreated one, the mechanical strength can be improved by 7.37 times, the interfacial adhesion energy to 1400 J m&#8722;2, and the healing efficiency to 100%, showing a general feature for the rapid generation of multifunctional hydrogels for biomedical and engineering applications.








Abstract
Hydrogels have demonstrated great potential in biomedical and engineering areas. To improve the physical performance, development of efficient physical/chemical protocols is essential. Herein, an electrochemistry functionalization strategy that is capable of enabling the functional improvements of hydrogel is reported. The electrochemistry functionalization is demonstrated on a hydrogel model of polyacrylamide (PAAm)@&#954;&#8208;carrageenan. The electrochemistry reaction generates metal ions (Fe3+) that migrate and coordinate with the sulfate groups of &#954;&#8208;carrageenan resulting in the prominent function improvements. In comparison with untreated PAAm@&#954;&#8208;carrageenan hydrogel, it can improve the mechanical strength by 7.37 times, and can increase the interfacial adhesion energy of the hydrogel on a glass surface from 0 to 1400 J m&#8722;2, stronger than the bonding strength of tendons (adhesion energy: &#8776;800 J m&#8722;2). Two pieces of hydrogel strips integrate into an intact structure by the electrochemistry functionalization, where the healing efficiency reaches 100% in comparison to the untreated hydrogel. The most significant development is that it enables functional patterning on the hydrogel by the electrode assembly, which provides the hydrogel with modular sensitivity to external pressure. Therefore, it can be a general protocol for rapid generation of multifunctional hydrogels for biomedical and engineering developments.

         <title>Large&#8208;Sized Graphene Oxide Nanosheets Increase DC&#8211;T&#8208;Cell Synaptic Contact and the Efficacy of DC Vaccines against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel material&#8208;based method of regulating dendritic cell (DC)&#8211;T&#8208;cell synaptic contact for adoptive DC vaccine engineering is reported. Graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets serve as a &#8220;nanozipper&#8221; or &#8220;double&#8208;sided tape&#8221; facilitating the formation and aggregation of DC&#8211;T&#8208;cell immune synapses to elicit robust cytotoxic T cell immune responses against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infection. Cytoskeleton&#8208;dependent membrane&#8208;positioning of intercellular cell adhesion molecule&#8208;1 (ICAM&#8208;1) might be the underlying mechanism.








Abstract
Dendritic cell (DC) vaccines are used for cancer and infectious diseases, albeit with limited efficacy. Modulating the formation of DC&#8211;T&#8208;cell synapses may greatly increase their efficacy. The effects of graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets on DCs and DC&#8211;T&#8208;cell synapse formation are evaluated. In particular, size&#8208;dependent interactions are observed between GO nanosheets and DCs. GOs with diameters of &gt;1 &#181;m (L&#8208;GOs) demonstrate strong adherence to the DC surface, inducing cytoskeletal reorganization via the RhoA&#8208;ROCK&#8208;MLC pathway, while relatively small GOs (&#8776;500 nm) are predominantly internalized by DCs. Furthermore, L&#8208;GO treatment enhances DC&#8211;T&#8208;cell synapse formation via cytoskeleton&#8208;dependent membrane positioning of integrin ICAM&#8208;1. L&#8208;GO acts as a &#8220;nanozipper,&#8221; facilitating the aggregation of DC&#8211;T&#8208;cell clusters to produce a stable microenvironment for T cell activation. Importantly, L&#8208;GO&#8208;adjuvanted DCs promote robust cytotoxic T cell immune responses against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike 1, leading to &gt;99.7% viral RNA clearance in mice infected with a clinically isolated SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 strain. These findings highlight the potential value of nanomaterials as DC vaccine adjuvants for modulating DC&#8211;T&#8208;cell synapse formation and provide a basis for the development of effective COVID&#8208;19 vaccines.

L-GO acts as a &#8220;nanozipper,&#8221; facilitating the aggregation of DC&#8211;T-cell clusters to produce a stable microenvironment for T cell activation. Importantly, L-GO-adjuvanted DCs promote robust cytotoxic T cell immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 spike 1, leading to &amp;gt;99.7% viral RNA clearance in mice infected with a clinically isolated SARS-CoV-2 strain. These findings highlight the potential value of nanomaterials as DC vaccine adjuvants for modulating DC&#8211;T-cell synapse formation and provide a basis for the development of effective COVID-19 vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reproducible X&#8208;ray Imaging with a Perovskite Nanocrystal Scintillator Embedded in a Transparent Amorphous Network Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;limited growth strategy is proposed to construct CsPbBr3 nanocrystals, which features X&#8208;imaging with excellent resolution (16.8&#160;lp&#160;mm&#8722;1). More importantly, the blurred X&#8208;ray images of the damaged perovskite NCs, due to irradiation at high dose rate, are well refreshed by a thermal treatment. This discovery broadens the research and application of the scintillators and opens a new chapter.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites are emerging scintillator materials in X&#8208;ray detection and imaging. However, the vulnerable structure of perovskites triggers unreliable performance when they are utilized in X&#8208;ray detectors under cumulative dose irradiation. Herein, a self&#8208;limited growth strategy is proposed to construct CsPbBr3 nanocrystals that are embedded in a transparent amorphous network structure, featuring X&#8208;imaging with excellent resolution (&#8776;16.8&#160;lp&#160;mm&#8722;1), and fast decay time (&#964;&#160;=&#160;27&#160;ns). Interestingly, it is found that the performance degradation of the scintillator, caused by the damage from high&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray irradiation, can be fully recovered after a facile thermal treatment process. This indicates a superior recycling behavior of the explored perovskites scintillator for practical applications. The recoverability of the as&#8208;explored scintillator is attributed to the low atom&#8208;migration rate in the amorphous network with high&#8208;viscosity (1&#160;&#215;&#160;1014&#160;cP). This result highlights the practical settlement of the promising perovskites for long&#8208;term, cost&#8208;effective scintillator devices.

         <title>Adaptive Cylindrical Wireless Metasurfaces in Clinical Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metasurface with homogeneous field distribution and nonlinear resonant modes is proposed. Adaptability is achieved using nonlinear elements, enabling the metasurface to be applicable to all clinical sequences without any parameters modified, also allowing two to four times signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio enhancement. The proposed design paves the way for the clinical applications of metasurfaces in magnetic resonance imaging.








Abstract
The signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (SNR) is one of the most important criteria for evaluating the image quality in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and metasurfaces with unique electromagnetic properties provide a novel method for SNR improvement. However, their applications in clinical MRI are highly restricted by the inhomogeneous enhancement of the magnetic field and interference in the radio frequency (RF) transmitting field. In this study, an adaptive cylindrical wireless metasurface (ACWM) with homogeneous field enhancement and adaptive resonant modes is reported. The ACWM automatically switches its resonant modes between the partial (transmitting period) and whole (receiving period) resonance, which enables it to not only eliminate the interference in RF transmitting field, but also greatly enhance the SNR. Its adaptability also makes the ACWM applicable to all common clinical sequences without any modifications in the scan parameters. The SNR of MRI images of the human wrist, acquired with ACWM, is two to four times compared with the conventional coil. This work offers a practical control method to fill the scientific knowledge gaps between the preclinical research and medical applications for metasurfaces, and suggests a novel and powerful tool for diagnosing and evaluating human diseases.

         <title>Cell&#8208;Membrane&#8208;Derived Nanoparticles with Notch&#8208;1 Suppressor Delivery Promote Hypoxic Cell&#8211;Cell Packing and Inhibit Angiogenesis Acting as a Two&#8208;Edged Sword</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cell&#8208;derived nanoparticles (CMNPs) promote physical tightening of cell&#8211;cell interactions and cell packing, thereby inducing hypoxia as a favorable setting for cancer progression and cartilage development. The conjugation of aptamers to CMNPs suppresses Notch&#8208;1 signaling&#8208;mediated angiogenesis with consequent activation of anti&#8208;cancer and chondroprotective effects (&#8220;two&#8208;edged sword&#8221;) in a xenograft model of human laryngeal cancer.








Abstract
Cell&#8211;cell interactions regulate intracellular signaling via reciprocal contacts of cell membranes in tissue regeneration and cancer growth, indicating a critical need of membrane&#8208;derived tools in studying these processes. Hence, cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;derived nanoparticles (CMNPs) are produced using tonsil&#8208;derived mesenchymal stem cells (TMSCs) from children owing to their short doubling time. As target cell types, laryngeal cancer cells are compared to&#160;bone&#8208;marrow&#8208;derived MSCs (BMSCs) because of their cartilage damaging and chondrogenic characteristics, respectively. Treating spheroids of these cell types with CMNPs exacerbates&#160;interspheroid&#160;hypoxia with robust maintenance of the cell&#8211;cell interaction signature for 7 days. Both cell types prefer a hypoxic environment, as opposed to blood vessel formation that is absent in cartilage but is required for cancer growth. Hence, angiogenesis is inhibited by displaying the Notch&#8208;1 aptamer on CMNPs. Consequently, laryngeal cancer growth is suppressed efficiently in contrast to improved chondroprotection observed in a series of cell and animal experiments using a xenograft mouse model of laryngeal cancer.&#160;Altogether, CMNPs execute&#160;a two&#8208;edged sword function of&#160;inducing hypoxic cell&#8211;cell packing, followed by suppressing angiogenesis to promote&#160;laryngeal cancer death and chondrogenesis&#160;simultaneously.&#160;This study presents a previously unexplored therapeutic strategy for anti&#8208;cancer and chondroprotective treatment using CMNPs.

         <title>Exceptionally High Blocking Temperature of 17 K in a Surface&#8208;Supported Molecular Magnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sub&#8208;monolayers of Dy2@C80(CH2Ph) dimetallofullerene single&#8208;molecule magnets are prepared on a graphene monolayer by electrospray deposition. Magnetic hysteresis and relaxation time measurements show that the magnetic moment remains stable for 100 s at 17 K, marking the blocking temperature TB(100), being not only in excellent agreement with that of the bulk but also representing by far the highest one detected for a surface&#8208;supported single&#8208;molecule magnet.








Abstract
Single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) are among the most promising building blocks for future magnetic data storage or quantum computing applications, owing to magnetic bistability and long magnetic relaxation times. The practical device integration requires realization of 2D surface assemblies of SMMs, where each magnetic unit shows magnetic relaxation being sufficiently slow at application&#8208;relevant temperatures. Using X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray magnetic circular dichroism, it is shown that sub&#8208;monolayers of Dy2@C80(CH2Ph) dimetallofullerenes prepared on graphene by electrospray deposition exhibit magnetic behavior fully comparable to that of the bulk. Magnetic hysteresis and relaxation time measurements show that the magnetic moment remains stable for 100 s at 17 K, marking the blocking temperature TB(100), being not only in excellent agreement with that of the bulk sample but also representing by far the highest one detected for a surface&#8208;supported single&#8208;molecule magnet. The reported findings give a boost to the efforts to stabilize and address the spin degree of freedom in molecular magnets aiming at the realization of SMM&#8208;based spintronic units.

         <title>Evaporation&#8208;Induced rGO Coatings for Highly Sensitive and Non&#8208;Invasive Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer in the PSA Gray Zone</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A circulating tumor cell (CTC)&#8208;chip based on evaporation&#8208;induced wrinkled reduced graphene oxide coating can achieve highly sensitive and non&#8208;invasive diagnosis of prostate cancer in the prostate&#8208;specific antigen (PSA) gray zone. Compared with the low diagnostic sensitivity (58.3%) of regular PSA&#8208;based tests, a combination of CTC detection and PSA&#8208;based tests via machine&#8208;learning analysis can greatly upgrade the diagnostic sensitivity of this disease to 91.7%.








Abstract
The prostate&#8208;specific antigen (PSA) has been widely used for the early diagnosis of prostate cancer during routine check&#8208;ups. However, the low sensitivity of regular PSA tests in the PSA gray zone often means that patients are required to undergo further invasive needle biopsy for the diagnosis of prostate cancer, which may lead to potential overdiagnosis and overtreatment. In this study, a circulating tumor cell (CTC)&#8208;chip based on an evaporation&#8208;induced reduced graphene oxide (rGO) coating is presented, which enables a highly specific and non&#8208;invasive diagnosis of prostate cancer in the PSA gray zone. During the evaporation process of the rGO dispersion, the Marangoni effect induces the self&#8208;assembly of a hierarchical micro/nanowrinkled rGO coating, which can capture CTCs after subsequent surface modification of capture agents. Compared to the low diagnostic sensitivity (58.3%) of regular PSA tests, a combination of CTC detection and PSA&#8208;based hematological tests via machine&#8208;learning analysis can greatly upgrade the diagnostic sensitivity of this disease to 91.7% in clinical trial. Therefore, this study provides a non&#8208;invasive alternative with high sensitivity for the diagnosis of prostate cancer in the PSA gray zone.

         <title>Fused&#8208;Silica 3D Chiral Metamaterials via Helium&#8208;Assisted Microcasting Supporting Topologically Protected Twist Edge Resonances with High Mechanical Quality Factors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel helium&#8208;assisted microcasting approach is introduced to fabricate 3D fused&#8208;silica microstructures. For a 3D chiral fused&#8208;silica metamaterial beam, the existence of topologically protected twist&#8208;edge resonances with large mechanical quality factors of 2850 is demonstrated. The microcasting approach can likely be translated to many other materials, and to complex architectures that are not amenable to direct 3D laser printing.








Abstract
It is predicted theoretically that a 1D diatomic chain of 3D chiral cells can support a topological bandgap that allows for translating a small time&#8208;harmonic axial movement at one end of the chain into a resonantly enhanced large rotation of an edge state at the other end. This edge state is topologically protected such that an arbitrary mass of a mirror at the other end does not shift the eigenfrequency out of the bandgap. Herein, this complex 3D laser&#8208;beam&#8208;scanner microstructure is realized in fused&#8208;silica form. A novel microcasting approach is introduced that starts from a hollow polymer cast made by standard 3D laser nanoprinting. The cast is evacuated and filled with helium, such that a highly viscous commercial glass slurry is sucked in. After UV curing and thermal debinding of the polymer, the fused&#8208;silica glass is sintered at 1225&#160;&#176;C under vacuum. Detailed optical measurements reveal a mechanical quality factor of the twist&#8208;edge resonance of 2850 at around 278&#160;kHz resonance frequency under ambient conditions. The microcasting approach can likely be translated to many other glasses, to metals and ceramics, and to complex architectures that are not or not yet amenable to direct 3D laser printing.

         <title>Manipulating the Local Coordination and Electronic Structures for Efficient Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bimetallic Ni&#8211;Fe selenide&#8208;derived (oxy)hydroxide nanocage electrocatalysts are in situ generated by inheriting the structure of the pre&#8208;catalyst. The successful manipulation of the local coordination and electronic structures of the electrocatalyst enables superior electrocatalytic activity and stability for the oxygen evolution reaction.








Abstract
Non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based nanomaterials can exhibit extraordinary electrocatalytic performance toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by harnessing the structural evolution during catalysis and the synergistic effect between elements. However, the structure of active centers in bimetallic/multimetallic catalysts is under long&#8208;time debate in the catalysis community. Here, an efficient bimetallic Ni&#8211;Fe selenide&#8208;derived OER electrocatalyst is reported and the structure&#8211;activity correlation during the OER evolution studied. By combining experiments and theoretical calculations,&#160;a conceptual advance is provided, in that the local coordination structure distortion and disordering of active sites inherited from the pre&#8208;catalyst and post&#8208;formed by a further reconstruction are responsible for boosting the OER performance. The active center is identified on Ni sites showing moderate bindings with oxygenous intermediates rather than Fe sites with strong and poisonous adsorptions. These findings provide crucial understanding in manipulating the local coordination and electronic structures toward rational design and fabrication of efficient OER electrocatalysts.

         <title>Optimizing Electronic Quality Factor toward High&#8208;Performance Ge1&#8722;x&#8722;yTaxSbyTe Thermoelectrics: The Role of Transition Metal Doping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nexus between electronic quality factor and thermoelectric figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;doped GeTe, which can serve as a facile yet efficient descriptor for high&#8208;throughput screening of good thermoelectric materials, is explained. To clarify this point, Ta&#8208;doped GeTe is designed with optimized electronic quality factor, rendering a figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit over 2.0 and a conceptional efficiency over 15%.








Abstract
Owing to high intrinsic figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit implemented by multi&#8208;band valleytronics, GeTe&#8208;based thermoelectric materials are promising for medium&#8208;temperature applications. Transition metals are widely used as dopants for developing high&#8208;performance GeTe thermoelectric materials. Herein, relevant work is critically reviewed to establish a correlation among transition metal doping, electronic quality factor, and figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit of GeTe. From first&#8208;principle calculations, it is found that Ta, as an undiscovered dopant in GeTe, can effectively converge energy offset between light and heavy conduction band extrema to enhance effective mass at high temperature. Such manipulation is verified by the increased Seebeck coefficient of synthesized Ge1&#8722;x&#8722;yTaxSbyTe samples from 160 to 180 &#181;V K&#8722;1 at 775 K upon doping Ta, then to 220 &#181;V K&#8722;1 with further alloying Sb. Characterization using electron microscopy also reveals the unique herringbone structure associated with multi&#8208;scale lattice defects induced by Ta doping, which greatly hinder phonon propagation to decrease thermal conductivity. As a result, a figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit of &#8776;2.0 is attained in the Ge0.88Ta0.02Sb0.10Te sample, reflecting a maximum heat&#8208;to&#8208;electricity efficiency up to 17.7% under a temperature gradient of 400 K. The rationalized beneficial effects stemming from Ta doping is an important observation that will stimulate new exploration toward high&#8208;performance GeTe&#8208;based thermoelectric materials.

A powerful one&#8208;step puffing carbonization technology is proposed to synthesize versatile multiscale carbon&#8208;based composites (e.g. carbon/metal oxides, carbon/metal carbides, carbon/metal sulfides, carbon/metals, metal/semiconductors, etc.) with controlled morphology, adjustable dimensions and tunable composition on a large scale. As a representative example, a sulfur&#8208;doped cross&#8208;linked puffed carbon (SCPC)/Li2S electrode shows extraordinary performance with superior rate capability and ultrastable cycling life.








Abstract
Carbon materials play a critical role in the advancement of electrochemical energy storage and conversion. Currently, it is still a great challenge to fabricate versatile carbon&#8208;based composites with controlled morphology, adjustable dimension, and tunable composition by a one&#8208;step synthesis process. In this work, a powerful one&#8208;step maltose&#8208;based puffing carbonization technology is reported to construct multiscale carbon&#8208;based composites on large scale. A quantity of composite examples (e.g., carbon/metal oxides, carbon/metal nitrides, carbon/metal carbides, carbon/metal sulfides, carbon/metals, metal/semiconductors, carbon/carbons) are prepared and demonstrated with required properties. These well&#8208;designed composites show advantages of large porosity, hierarchical porous structure, high conductivity, tunable components, and proportion. The formation mechanism of versatile carbon composites is attributed to the puffing&#8208;carbonization of maltose plus in situ carbothermal reaction between maltose and precursors. As a representative example, Li2S is in situ implanted into a hierarchical porous cross&#8208;linked puffed carbon (CPC) matrix to verify its application in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. The designed S&#8208;doped CPC/Li2S cathode shows superior electrochemical performance with higher rate capacity (621 mAh g&#8211;1 at 2 C), smaller polarization and enhanced long&#8208;term cycles as compared to other counterparts. The research provides a general way for the construction of multifunctional component&#8208;adjustable carbon composites for advanced energy storage and conversion.

         <title>Rational Design of Highly Stable and Active MXene&#8208;Based Bifunctional ORR/OER Double&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni1/Ni2&#8208; and Fe1/Ni2&#8208;modified MXene&#8208;based double&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) show the most promising bifunctional oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)/oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic performances. The bifunctional catalytic activities of DACs improve with increasing strain. Theoretical models are presented for plotting the polarization curves of OER/ORR catalysis to demonstrate the bifunctional catalytic performance of the studied catalysts.








Abstract
Designing highly active and bifunctional oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts has attracted great interest toward metal&#8211;air batteries. Herein, an efficient solution to the search for MXene&#8208;based bifunctional catalysts is proposed by introducing non&#8208;noble metals such as Fe/Co/Ni at the surfaces. These results indicate that the ultrahigh activities in Ni1/Ni2&#8208; and Fe1/Ni2&#8208;modified MXene&#8208;based double&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) for bifunctional ORR/OER are better than those of well&#8208;known unifunctional catalysts with low overpotentials, such as Pt(111) for the ORR and IrO2(110) for the OER. Strain can profoundly regulate the catalytic activities of MXene&#8208;based DACs, providing a novel pathway for tunable catalytic behavior in flexible MXenes. An electrochemical model, based on density functional theory and theoretical polarization curves, is proposed to reveal the underlying mechanisms, in agreement with experimental results. Electronic structure analyses indicate that the excellent catalytic activities in the MXene&#8208;based DACs are attributed to the electron&#8208;capturing capability and synergistic interactions between Fe/Co/Ni adsorbents and MXene substrate. These findings not only reveal promising candidates for MXene&#8208;based bifunctional ORR/OER catalysts but also provide new theoretical insights into rationally designing noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free bifunctional DACs.

         <title>Orbital Angular Momentum from Self&#8208;Assembled Concentric Nanoparticle Rings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Concentric rings of plasmonic nanoparticles are fabricated by self&#8208;assembling supramolecular nanocomposites on lithographically patterned surfaces. After assembly, the arrays of concentric rings generate high&#8208;quality orbital angular momentum (OAM). Due to their unique ability to self&#8208;regulate the distribution of each building block, supramolecular nanocomposites are a robust assembly platform. In this work, they accommodate variations in pattern dimension, nanoparticle loading, and nanoparticle ring size.








Abstract
Ring&#8208;shaped nanostructures can focus, filter, and manipulate electromagnetic waves, but are challenging to incorporate into devices using standard nanofabrication techniques. Directed self&#8208;assembly (DSA) of block copolymers (BCPs) on lithographically patterned templates has successfully been used to fabricate concentric rings and spirals as etching masks. However, this method is limited by BCP phase behavior and material selection. Here, a straightforward approach to generate ring&#8208;shaped nanoparticle assemblies in thin films of supramolecular nanocomposites is demonstrated. DSA is used to guide the formation of concentric rings with radii spanning 150&#8211;1150&#160;nm and ring widths spanning 30&#8211;60&#160;nm. When plasmonic nanoparticles are used, ring nanodevice arrays can be fabricated in one step, and the completed devices produce high&#8208;quality orbital angular momentum (OAM). Nanocomposite DSA simplifies and streamlines nanofabrication by producing metal structures without etching or deposition steps; it also introduces interparticle coupling as a new design axis. Detailed analysis of the nanoparticle ring assemblies confirms that the supramolecular system self&#8208;regulates the spatial distribution of its components, and thus exhibits a degree of flexibility absent in DSA of BCPs alone, where structures are determined by polymer&#8208;pattern incommensurability. The present studies also provide guidelines for developing self&#8208;regulating DSA as an alternative to incommensurability&#8208;driven methods.

         <title>A Supramolecular Antidote to Macromolecular Toxins Prepared through Coassembly of Macrocyclic Amphiphiles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular detoxification is an emerging strategy for treating poisoning; however, developing supramolecular therapeutic materials as an antidote to macromolecular toxins is challenging. To overcome this challenge, a heteromultivalent coassembling material (CCA&#8208;CD) comprising macrocyclic amphiphiles is developed. The CCA&#8208;CD binds with melittin strongly and selectively, and significantly alleviates its toxicity, serving as a novel supramolecular antidote used for melittin poisoning treatment.








Abstract
Poisoning is a leading cause of admission to medical emergency departments and intensive care units. Supramolecular detoxification, which involves injecting supramolecular receptors that bind with toxins to suppress their biological activity, is an emerging strategy for poisoning treatment; it has few requirements and a broad application scope. However, it is still a formidable challenge to design supramolecular therapeutic materials as an antidote to macromolecular toxins, because the large size, flexible conformation, and presence of multiple and diverse binding sites of biomacromolecules hinder their recognition. Herein, a supramolecular antidote to macromolecular toxins is developed through the coassembly of macrocyclic amphiphiles, relying on heteromultivalent recognition between the coassembled components and toxic macromolecules. The coassembly of amphiphilic cyclodextrin and calixarene strongly and selectively captures melittin, a toxin studied herein; this imparts various therapeutic effects such as inhibiting the interactions of melittin with cell membranes, alleviating melittin cytotoxicity and hemolytic toxicity, reducing the mortality rate of melittin&#8208;poisoned mice, and mitigating damage to major organs. The use of the proposed antidote overcomes the limitation of supramolecular detoxification applicability to only small&#8208;molecular toxins. The antidote can also detoxify other macromolecular toxins as long as selective and strong binding is achieved because of the coassembling tunability.

         <title>3D Temporary&#8208;Magnetized Soft Robotic Structures for Enhanced Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a mechanically guided, compressive&#8208;buckling process, a set of judiciously engineered 3D soft robotic structures can be developed based on magnetic materials. Under the precise control of the external magnetic&#8208;field, the temporary&#8208;magnetized 3D structures can achieve various tethered locomotion. Further integration with functional devices (piezoelectric energy harvester, solar cell) allows for enhanced energy harvesting, and potentially multimodal sensing and robotic interfaces.








Abstract
The advent of functional materials offers tremendous potential in a broad variety of areas such as electronics, robotics, and energy devices. Magnetic materials are an attractive candidate that enable multifunctional devices with capabilities in both sensing and actuation. However, current magnetic devices, especially those with complex motion modalities, rely on permanently magnetized materials with complicated, non&#8208;uniform magnetization profiles.

&lt;p&gt;Through a mechanically guided, compressive-buckling process, a set of judiciously engineered 3D soft robotic structures can be developed based on magnetic materials. Under the precise control of the external magnetic-field, the temporary-magnetized 3D structures can achieve various tethered locomotion. Further integration with functional devices (piezoelectric energy harvester, solar cell) allows for enhanced energy harvesting, and potentially multimodal sensing and robotic interfaces.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advent of functional materials offers tremendous potential in a broad variety of areas such as electronics, robotics, and energy devices. Magnetic materials are an attractive candidate that enable multifunctional devices with capabilities in both sensing and actuation. However, current magnetic devices, especially those with complex motion modalities, rely on permanently magnetized materials with complicated, non-uniform magnetization profiles. Here, based on magnetic materials with temporary-magnetization, a mechanically guided assembly process successfully converts laser-patterned 2D magnetic materials into judiciously engineered 3D structures, with dimensions and geometries ranging from mesoscale 3D filaments, to arrayed centimeter-scale 3D membranes. With tailorable mechanical properties and highly adjustable geometries, 3D soft structures can exhibit various tethered locomotions under the precise control of magnetic fields, including local deformation, unidirectional tilting, and omnidirectional rotation, and can serve as dynamic surfaces for further integration with other functional materials or devices.

         <title>Sweet Electronics: Honey&#8208;Gated Complementary Organic Transistors and Circuits Operating in Air</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of edible electronics devices requires unconventional solutions, in particular, the use of functional food&#8208;based materials in the design. An inherently safe and nutritive compound, honey, is hereby proposed as an effective gating medium for the realization of air&#8208;stable complementary organic transistors and circuits operating at low voltage (&lt;1&#160;V) and featuring other distinctive electronic functionalities.








Abstract
Sustainable harnessing of natural resources is key moving toward a new&#8208;generation electronics, which features a unique combination of electronic functionality, low cost, and absence of environmental and health hazards. Within this framework, edible electronics, of which transistors and circuits are a fundamental component, is an emerging field, exploiting edible materials that can be safely ingested, and subsequently digested after performing their function. Dielectrics are a critical functional element of transistors, often constituting their major volume. Yet, to date, there are only scarce examples of electrolytic food&#8208;based materials able to provide low&#8208;voltage operation of transistors at ambient conditions. In this context, a cost&#8208;effective and edible substance, honey, is proposed to be used as an electrolytic gate viscous dielectric in electrolyte&#8208;gated organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs). Both n&#8208; and p&#8208;type honey&#8208;gated OFETs (HGOFETs) are demonstrated, with distinctive features such as low voltage (&lt;1 V)&#160;operation, long&#8208;term shelf life and operation stability in air, and compatibility with large&#8208;area fabrication processes, such as inkjet printing on edible tattoo&#8208;paper. Such complementary devices enable robust honey&#8208;based integrated logic circuits, here exemplified by inverting logic gates and ring oscillators. A marked device responsivity to humidity provides promising opportunities for sensing applications, specifically, for moisture control of dried or dehydrated food.

         <title>Hierarchical Self&#8208;Assembly of Organic Core/Multi&#8208;Shell Microwires for Trichromatic White&#8208;Light Sources</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>

Through regulating the noncovalent interactions between organic semiconductor molecules (|ECT, DgpC&#8208;TCNB = &#8722;18.35&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1|&#160;&gt;&#160;|ECT, DgpC&#8208;TFP = &#8722;13.45&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1|&#160;&gt;&#160;|E&#960;&#8211;&#960;, DgpC = &#8722;6.81&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1|), a hierarchical self&#8208;assembly approach of horizontal epitaxial&#8208;growth is demonstrated for the precise synthesis of organic core/double&#8208;shell microwires with radial red&#8211;green&#8211;blue (RGB) substructures for miniaturized white&#8208;light sources (CIE [0.34, 0.36]).








Abstract
White&#8208;light&#8208;emissive organic micro/nanostructures hold exotic potential applications in full&#8208;color displays, on&#8208;chip wavelength&#8208;division multiplexing, and backlights of portable display devices, but are rarely realized in organic core/shell heterostructures. Herein, through regulating the noncovalent interactions between organic semiconductor molecules, a hierarchical self&#8208;assembly approach of horizontal epitaxial&#8208;growth is demonstrated for the fine synthesis of organic core/mono&#8208;shell microwires with multicolor emission (red&#8211;green, red&#8211;blue, and green&#8211;blue) and especially organic core/double&#8208;shell microwires with radial red&#8211;green&#8211;blue (RGB) emission, whose components are dibenzo[g,p]chrysene (DgpC)&#8208;based charge&#8208;transfer (CT) complexes. In fact, the desired lattice mismatching (&#8776;2%) and the excellent structure compatibility of these CT complexes facilitate the epitaxial&#8208;growth process for the facile synthesis of organic core/shell microwires. With the RGB&#8208;emissive substructures, these core/double&#8208;shell organic microwires are microscale white&#8208;light sources (CIE [0.34, 0.36]). Besides, the white&#8208;emissive core/double&#8208;shell microwires demonstrate the fascinating full&#8208;spectrum light transportation from 400 to 700&#160;nm. This work indeed opens up a novel avenue for the accurate construction of organic core/shell heterostructures, which provides an attractive platform for the organic integrated optoelectronics.

         <title>Time&#8211;Temperature Integrating Optical Sensors Based on Gradient Colloidal Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A colloidal stopband&#8208;based time&#8211;temperature integrator is introduced, which can monitor the thermal history of a specific system over an adjustable time and temperature range. The fabrication of a binary colloidal crystal gradient comprising same&#8208;sized, monodisperse particles with distinct glass transition temperatures are the key components for this type of integrating sensor.








Abstract
Manipulation&#8208;free and autonomous recording of temperature states for extended periods of time is of increasing importance for food spoilage and battery safety assessment. An optical readout is preferred for low&#8208;tech visual inspection. Here, a concept for time&#8211;temperature integrators based on colloidal crystals is introduced. Two unique features in this class of advanced materials are combined: 1) the film&#8208;formation kinetics can be controlled by orders of magnitude based on mixtures of particles with distinct glass transition temperatures. 2) A gradual variation of the particle mixture along a linear gradient of the colloidal crystal enables local readout. Tailor&#8208;made latex particles of identical size but different glass transition temperatures provide a homogenous photonic stopband. The disappearance of this opalescence is directly related to the local particle ratio and the exposure to a time and temperature combination. This sensing material can be adjusted to report extended intermediate and short excessive temperature events, which makes it specifically suitable for long&#8208;term tracing and threshold applications.

         <title>3D Printing of Elastomeric Bioinspired Complex Adhesive Microstructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D&#8208;printing&#8208;based fabrication approach is utilized for creating complex elastomeric microstructural adhesives directly. Two hybrid bioinspired structure designs are demonstrated, combining the strengths of gecko&#8208;inspired microfiber adhesives with springtail&#8208; and octopus&#8208;inspired microstructures to enable complex adhesives toward various real&#8208;world applications.








Abstract
Bioinspired elastomeric structural adhesives can provide reversible and controllable adhesion on dry/wet and synthetic/biological surfaces for a broad range of commercial applications. Shape complexity and performance of the existing structural adhesives are limited by the used specific fabrication technique, such as molding. To overcome these limitations by proposing complex 3D microstructured adhesive designs, a 3D elastomeric microstructure fabrication approach is implemented using two&#8208;photon&#8208;polymerization&#8208;based 3D printing. A custom aliphatic urethane&#8208;acrylate&#8208;based elastomer is used as the 3D printing material. Two designs are demonstrated with two combined biological inspirations to show the advanced capabilities enabled by the proposed fabrication approach and custom elastomer. The first design focuses on springtail&#8208; and gecko&#8208;inspired hybrid microfiber adhesive, which has the multifunctionalities of side&#8208;surface liquid super&#8208;repellency, top&#8208;surface liquid super&#8208;repellency, and strong reversible adhesion features in a single fiber array. The second design primarily centers on octopus&#8208; and gecko&#8208;inspired hybrid adhesive, which exhibits the benefits of both octopus&#8208; and gecko&#8208;inspired microstructured adhesives for strong reversible adhesion on both wet and dry surfaces, such as skin. This fabrication approach could be used to produce many other 3D complex elastomeric structural adhesives for future real&#8208;world applications.

The first design focuses on springtail- and gecko-inspired hybrid microfiber adhesive, which has the multifunctionalities of side-surface liquid super-repellency, top-surface liquid super-repellency, and strong reversible adhesion features in a single fiber array. The second design primarily centers on octopus- and gecko-inspired hybrid adhesive, which exhibits the benefits of both octopus- and gecko-inspired microstructured adhesives for strong reversible adhesion on both wet and dry surfaces, such as skin. This fabrication approach could be used to produce many other 3D complex elastomeric structural adhesives for future real-world applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Crosslinked Dynamic Hydrogel Incorporating {Mo154} with pH and NIR Responsiveness for Chemo&#8208;Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual pH&#8208; and near infra&#8208;red (NIR)&#8208;responsive hydrogel is developed composed of benzylaldehyde functionalized poly(ethylene glycol), poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) functionalized chitosan, and a polyoxometalate {Mo154}. Crosslinked by Schiff base and electrostatic interactions, the hydrogel has dynamic networks, injectability, and fast self&#8208;healing properties. Combining doxorubicin and NIR laser irradiation, the hydrogel shows thermal ablation of cancer cells and simultaneous release of drugs for chemo&#8208;photothermal therapy.








Abstract
Polyoxometalates are an emerging class of molecular clusters, with well&#8208;defined structures and chemical compositions that are produced through simple, low&#8208;cost, and highly reproducible methods. In particular, the wheel&#8208;shaped cluster {Mo154} is a promising photothermal agent due to its intervalence charge transfer transitions. However, its toxicity hinders its systemic administration, being the development of a localized delivery system still incipient. Herein, an injectable and self&#8208;healing hydrogel of easy preparation and administration is developed, incorporating both {Mo154} and doxorubicin for synergistic photothermal and chemotherapy applications. The hydrogel is composed of benzylaldehyde functionalized polyethylene glycol, poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) functionalized chitosan and {Mo154}. The gelation occurs within 60&#160;s at room temperature, and the dual crosslinking by Schiff base and electrostatic interactions generates a dynamic network, which enables self&#8208;healing after injection. Moreover, the hydrogel delivers chemotherapeutic drugs, with a release triggered by dual near infra&#8208;red (NIR) radiation and pH changes. This stimuli&#8208;responsive release system along with the photothermal conversion ability of the hydrogel allows the simultaneous combination of photothermal and chemotherapy. This synergic system efficiently ablates the cancer tumor in vivo with no systemic toxicity. Overall, this work paves the way for the development of novel {Mo154}&#8208;based systems, incorporated in self&#8208;healing and injectable hydrogels for dual chemo&#8208;photothermal therapy.

         <title>Antibacterial Gel Coatings Inspired by the Cryptic Function of a Mussel Byssal Peptide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In addition to its role in wet adhesion, it is discovered that a peptide (Mfp&#8208;529&#8208;47) derived from the foot pad of mussels exhibits cryptic antibacterial activity. This discovery inspires the design of antibacterial adhesive hydrogels that kill bacteria by two mechanisms: surface&#8208;contact membrane disruption and oxidative killing. The lead material, MIKA2, inhibits bacterial colonization on titanium implants in mice.








Abstract
Although the adhesive and cohesive nature of mussel byssal proteins have long served to inspire the design of materials embodying these properties, their characteristic amino acid compositions suggest that they might also serve to inspire an unrelated material function not yet associated with this class of protein. Herein, it is demonstrated that a peptide derived from mussel foot protein&#8208;5, a key protein in mussel adhesion, displays antibacterial properties, a yet unreported activity. This cryptic function serves as inspiration for the design of a new class of peptide&#8208;based antibacterial adhesive hydrogels prepared via self&#8208;assembly, which are active against drug&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. The gels exert two mechanisms of action, surface&#8208;contact membrane disruption and oxidative killing affected by material&#8208;produced H2O2. Detailed studies relating amino acid composition and sequence to material mechanical adhesion/cohesion and antibacterial activity affords the MIKA2 adhesive gel, a material with a superior activity that is shown to inhibit colonization of titanium implants in mice.

         <title>Monte Carlo Simulations Reveal New Design Principles for Efficient Nanoradiosensitizers Based on Nanoscale Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive Monte Carlo simulation study reveals nanoscale metal&#8211;organic frameworks (nMOFs) as superior radiosensitizers over non&#8208;porous nanoparticles. The porous lattice model shows improved radiosensitization regardless of radiation source and lattice size. An optimal dose enhancement can be achieved by tuning the geometry of the lattice, providing the theoretical basis for the design of nMOFs for radiotherapy.








Abstract
Nanoscale metal&#8211;organic frameworks (nMOFs) have recently been shown to provide better radiosensitization than solid nanoparticles (NPs) when excited with X&#8208;rays. Here, a Monte Carlo simulation of different radiosensitization effects by NPs and nMOFs using a lattice model consisting of 3D arrays of nanoscale secondary building units (SBUs) is reported. The simulation results reveal that lattices outperform solid NPs regardless of radiation sources or particle sizes via enhanced scatterings of photons and electrons within the lattices. Optimum dose enhancement can be achieved by tuning SBU size and inter&#8208;SBU distance.

         <title>Cactus&#8208;Spine&#8208;Inspired Sweat&#8208;Collecting Patch for Fast and Continuous Monitoring of Sweat</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sweat&#8208;collecting patch with high sweat&#8208;collection efficiency is developed. The patch uses cactus&#8208;spine&#8208;inspired wedge&#8208;shaped wettability&#8208;patterned channels, which induce a unidirectional Laplace pressure that transports the sweat to the sensing&#8208;area spontaneously without leaving it inside the channel. A sensor based on the patch responds quickly to biochemicals in sweat and the patch enables the continuous monitoring of biochemical changes in sweat.








Abstract
A sweat sensor is expected to be the most appropriate wearable device for noninvasive healthcare monitoring. However, the practical use of sweat sensors is impeded by irregular and low sweat secretion rates. Here, a sweat&#8208;collecting patch that can collect sweat efficiently for fast and continuous healthcare monitoring is demonstrated. The patch uses cactus&#8208;spine&#8208;inspired wedge&#8208;shaped wettability&#8208;patterned channels on a hierarchical microstructured/nanostructured surface. The channel shape, in combination with the superhydrophobic/superhydrophilic surface materials, induces a unidirectional Laplace pressure that transports the sweat to the sensing area spontaneously even when the patch is aligned vertically. The patch demonstrates superior sweat&#8208;collecting efficiency and reduces the time required to fill the sensing area by transporting sweat almost without leaving it inside the channel. Therefore, a sensor based on the patch responds quickly to biochemicals in sweat, and the patch enables the continuous monitoring of changes in sweat biochemicals according to their changes in the wearer's blood.

         <title>Engineered Extracellular Matrices with Integrated Wireless Microactuators to Study Mechanobiology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in vitro biomimetic platform that provides independent control over geometry, mechanics, and structure over extracellular matrices is introduced. Remote application of forces using robotically controlled magnetic microactuators triggers native mechanobiology responses including intracellular signaling and directed migration. A digital twin complements the platform by reporting stresses generated upon actuation.








Abstract
Mechanobiology explores how forces regulate cell behaviors and what molecular machinery are responsible for the sensing, transduction, and modulation of mechanical cues. To this end, probing of cells cultured on planar substrates has served as a primary experimental setting for many decades. However, native extracellular matrices (ECMs) consist of fibrous protein assemblies where the physical properties spanning from the individual fiber to the network architecture can influence the transmission of forces to and from the cells. Here, a robotic manipulation platform that allows wireless, localized, and programmable deformation of an engineered fibrous ECM is introduced. A finite&#8208;element&#8208;based digital twin of the fiber network calibrated against measured local and global parameters enables the calculation of deformations and stresses generated by different magnetic actuation schemes across a range of network properties. Physiologically relevant mechanical forces are applied to cells cultured on the fiber network, statically or dynamically, revealing insights into the effects of matrix&#8208;borne forces and deformations as well as force&#8208;mediated matrix remodeling on cell migration and intracellular signaling. These capabilities are not matched by any existing approach, and this versatile platform has the potential to uncover fundamental mechanisms of mechanobiology in settings with greater relevance to living tissues.

     alt="Engineered Extracellular Matrices with Integrated Wireless Microactuators to Study Mechanobiology"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An in vitro biomimetic platform that provides independent control over geometry, mechanics, and structure over extracellular matrices is introduced. Remote application of forces using robotically controlled magnetic microactuators triggers native mechanobiology responses including intracellular signaling and directed migration. A digital twin complements the platform by reporting stresses generated upon actuation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mechanobiology explores how forces regulate cell behaviors and what molecular machinery are responsible for the sensing, transduction, and modulation of mechanical cues. To this end, probing of cells cultured on planar substrates has served as a primary experimental setting for many decades. However, native extracellular matrices (ECMs) consist of fibrous protein assemblies where the physical properties spanning from the individual fiber to the network architecture can influence the transmission of forces to and from the cells. Here, a robotic manipulation platform that allows wireless, localized, and programmable deformation of an engineered fibrous ECM is introduced. A finite-element-based digital twin of the fiber network calibrated against measured local and global parameters enables the calculation of deformations and stresses generated by different magnetic actuation schemes across a range of network properties. Physiologically relevant mechanical forces are applied to cells cultured on the fiber network, statically or dynamically, revealing insights into the effects of matrix-borne forces and deformations as well as force-mediated matrix remodeling on cell migration and intracellular signaling. These capabilities are not matched by any existing approach, and this versatile platform has the potential to uncover fundamental mechanisms of mechanobiology in settings with greater relevance to living tissues.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Promoting Energy Transfer via Manipulation of Crystallization Kinetics of Quasi&#8208;2D Perovskites for Efficient Green Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A homogeneous distribution of different&#8208;n phases and more efficient energy transfer is realized in quasi&#8208;2D perovskites. The origin is found to be the manipulation of the crystallization kinetics, where the addition of potassium restricts the nucleation of high&#8208;n phases and allows the growth of low&#8208;n phases, resulting in an external quantum efficiency of 18.15%.








Abstract
Quasi&#8208;2D (Q&#8208;2D) perovskites are promising materials applied in light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) due to their high exciton binding energy and quantum confinement effects. However, Q&#8208;2D perovskites feature a multiphase structure with abundant grain boundaries and interfaces, leading to nonradiative loss during the energy&#8208;transfer process. Here, a more efficient energy transfer in Q&#8208;2D perovskites is achieved by manipulating the crystallization kinetics of different&#8208;n phases. A series of alkali&#8208;metal bromides is utilized to manipulate the nucleation and growth of Q&#8208;2D perovskites, which is likely associated with the Coulomb interaction between alkali&#8208;metal ions and the negatively charged PbBr64&#8211; frames. The incorporation of K+ is found to restrict the nucleation of high&#8208;n phases and allows the subsequent growth of low&#8208;n phases, contributing to a spatially more homogeneous distribution of different&#8208;n phases and promoted energy transfer. As a result, highly efficient green Q&#8208;2D perovskites LEDs with a champion EQE of 18.15% and a maximum brightness of 25 800&#160;cd m&#8211;2 are achieved. The findings affirm a novel method to optimize the performance of Q&#8208;2D perovskite LEDs.

         <title>An Optogenetics&#8208;Inspired Flexible van der Waals Optoelectronic Synapse and its Application to a Convolutional Neural Network</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible van der Waals (vdW) optoelectronic synapse fabricated on 2D vdW layered rhenium disulfide, which features an inherent photosensitive memory nature derived from the persistent photoconductivity effect, is proposed. Following in&#8208;depth analysis including density functional theory calculations on rhenium disulfide, its feasibility for hardware neural networks with learning ability is demonstrated using a convolutional neural network composed of vdW optoelectronic synapses.








Abstract
Optogenetics refers to a technique that uses light to modulate neuronal activity with a high spatiotemporal resolution, which enables the manipulation of learning and memory functions in the human brain. This strategy of controlling neuronal activity using light can be applied for the development of intelligent systems, including neuromorphic and in&#8208;memory computing systems. Herein, a flexible van der Waals (vdW) optoelectronic synapse is reported, which is a core component of optogenetics&#8208;inspired intelligent systems. This synapse is fabricated on 2D vdW layered rhenium disulfide (ReS2) that features an inherent photosensitive memory nature derived from the persistent photoconductivity (PPC) effect, successfully mimicking the dynamics of biological synapses. Based on first&#8208;principles calculations, the PPC effect is identified to originate from sulfur vacancies in ReS2 that have an inherent tendency to form shallow defect states near the conduction band edges and under optical excitation lead to large lattice relaxation. Finally, the feasibility of applying the synapses in optogenetics&#8208;inspired intelligent systems is demonstrated via training and inference tasks for the CIFAR&#8208;10 dataset using a convolutional neural network composed of vdW optoelectronic synapse devices.

         <title>Spontaneous Topological Magnetic Transitions in NdCo5 Rare&#8208;Earth Magnets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spontaneous magnetic biskyrmion lattices and the successive transformation into enclosed in&#8208;plane domains over a broad temperature range of 120&#8211;282 K is directly observed by in situ cooling a hexagonal rare&#8208;earth NdCo5 alloy in Lorentz TEM. The ability to manipulate topological magnetization by anisotropy invites application exploration of novel topological magnetic spin textures and physical mechanisms in rare&#8208;earth magnets.








Abstract
Particle&#8208;like magnetic textures with nanometric sizes, such as skyrmions, are potentially suitable for designing high&#8208;efficiency information bits in future spintronics devices. In general, the Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interactions and dipolar interactions are the dominant factors for generating nonlinear spin configurations. However, to stabilize the topological skyrmions, an external magnetic field is usually required. In this study, the spontaneous emergence of skyrmions is directly observed, together with the unique successive topological domain evolution during the spin reorientation transition in a neodymium&#8211;cobalt (NdCo5) rare&#8208;earth magnet. On decreasing the temperature, nanometric skyrmion lattices evolve into enclosed in&#8208;plane domains (EIPDs) similar to mini bar&#8208;magnets with size below 120&#160;nm. The internal magnetization rotates with magnetic anisotropy, demonstrating the ability to manipulate the mini bar&#8208;magnets. The nanoscale EIPD lattices remain robust over the wide temperature range of 241&#8211;167 K, indicating the possibility of high&#8208;density in&#8208;plane magnetic information storage. The generation of spontaneous magnetic skyrmions and the successive domain transformation in the traditional NdCo5 rare&#8208;earth magnet may prompt application exploration for topological magnetic spin textures with novel physical mechanisms in versatile magnets.

         <title>Self&#8208;Induced Type&#8208;I Band Alignment at Surface Grain Boundaries for Highly Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultralow surface temperature on perovskite films is constructed, then surface perovskite lattice is etched by the condensed moisture. Therefore, PbI2 is produced and type&#8208;I band alignment at the upper surface grain boundaries is formed, which significantly reduces the interface loss of carriers and improves the efficiency of perovskite solar cells to 23.2%.








Abstract
The open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is reported to be significantly weakened by carrier loss at the film surface. Here, the moisture condensation at only the upper surface of perovskite films is controlled by constructing an ultralow surface temperature. Then, type&#8208;I band alignment can be formed at the surface grain boundaries due to the etching effect of trace amounts of condensed moisture. The beneficially constructed surface type&#8208;I band alignment can effectively repel carriers and return them to the inside of the grain, significantly avoiding the carrier loss at films surface. As a result, a superior carrier lifetime exceeding 2.5&#160;&#181;s is obtained and the VOC of PSC is remarkably boosted from 1.07 to 1.17&#160;V. The minimum VOC deficit of only 0.39&#160;V enables a substantial gain in power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 20.2% to 22.4% in one&#8208;step spin&#8208;coating methods. Moreover, this innovation is versatile and a champion PCE of 23.2% is also achieved in two&#8208;step spin&#8208;coating methods.

         <title>Reversible Dendritic&#8208;Crystal&#8208;Reinforced Polymer Gel for Bioinspired Adaptable Adhesive</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crystal&#8208;fiber&#8208;reinforced polymer gel adhesive is prepared by introducing room&#8208;temperature crystallizable solvent into the polymer network, realizing ultrastrong adhesion strength and universal interface adaptability. The adhesive ensures the high adhesion strength to the hard interface and excellent peeling toughness to soft biological tissues and can be adjusted via external stimuli, which achieves superior detachability and recycling performance.








Abstract
High&#8208;strength and reversible adhesion technology, which is a universal phenomenon in nature but remains challenging for artificial synthesis, is essential for the development of modern science. Existing adhesive designs without interface versatility hinder their application to arbitrary surfaces. Bioinspired by creeper suckers, a crystal&#8208;fiber reinforced polymer gel adhesive with ultrastrong adhesion strength and universal interface adaptability is creatively prepared via introducing a room&#8208;temperature crystallizable solvent into the polymer network. The gel adhesive formed by hydrogen bonding interaction between crystal fibers and polymer network can successfully realize over 9.82&#160;MPa reversible adhesion strength for rough interface and 406.87 J m&#8722;2 peeling toughness for skin tissue. In situ anchoring is achieved for adapting to different geometrical surfaces. The adhesion performance can be significantly improved with the further increase of the interfacial roughness and hydrophilicity, whose dissipation mechanism is simulated by finite element analysis. The melting&#8211;crystallization equilibrium of the crystal fibers is proved by synchrotron radiation scattering. Accordingly, reversible phase&#8208;transition triggered by light and heat can realize the controlled adhere&#8211;detach recycle. Later adjustments to the monomers or crystals are expected to broaden its applications to various fields such as bioelectronics, electronic processing, and machine handling.

         <title>A Micrometer&#8208;Sized Silicon/Carbon Composite Anode Synthesized by Impregnation of Petroleum Pitch in Nanoporous Silicon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A micrometer&#8208;sized silicon/carbon composite anode developed by facile and scalable impregnation of petroleum pitch that stabilizes nanoporous Si against sintering at high temperature is reported. The composite anode including single nanometer&#8208;sized primary particles shielded by pitch&#8208;derived carbon exhibits outstanding battery performance such as 80% capacity retention after 450 cycles in the full cell system.








Abstract
Porous silicon (Si)/carbon nanocomposites have been extensively explored as a promising anode material for high&#8208;energy lithium (Li)&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, shrinking of the pores and sintering of Si in the nanoporous structure during fabrication often diminishes the full benefits of nanoporous Si. Herein, a scalable method is reported to preserve the porous Si nanostructure by impregnating petroleum pitch inside of porous Si before high&#8208;temperature treatment. The resulting micrometer&#8208;sized Si/C composite maintains a desired porosity to accommodate large volume change and high conductivity to facilitate charge transfer. It also forms a stable surface coating that limits the penetration of electrolyte into nanoporous Si and minimizes the side reaction between electrolyte and Si during cycling and storage. A Si&#8208;based anode with 80% of pitch&#8208;derived carbon/nanoporous Si enables very stable cycling of a Si||Li(Ni0.5Co0.2Mn0.3)O2 (NMC532) battery (80% capacity retention after 450 cycles). It also leads to low swelling in both particle and electrode levels required for the next generation of high&#8208;energy LIBs. The process also can be used to preserve the porous structure of other nanoporous materials that need to be treated at high temperatures.

         <title>Lithiation&#8208;Enabled High&#8208;Density Nitrogen Vacancies Electrocatalyze CO2 to C2 Products</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical CO2 reduction to produce C2 products is attractive but is still challenged by low activity and poor selectivity. A Cu3Nx catalyst with abundant nitrogen vacancies induced by lithiation/delithiation presents a much&#8208;improved Faradaic efficiency of &#8776;82% for C2 products due to the lower energy barriers of the key C2 pathway intermediates.








Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction to produce valuable C2 products is attractive but still suffers with relatively poor selectivity and stability at high current densities, mainly due to the low efficiency in the coupling of two *CO intermediates. Herein, it is demonstrated that high&#8208;density nitrogen vacancies formed on cubic copper nitrite (Cu3Nx) feature as efficient electrocatalytic centers for CO&#8211;CO coupling to form the key OCCO* intermediate toward C2 products. Cu3Nx with different nitrogen densities are fabricated by an electrochemical lithium tuning strategy, and density functional theory calculations indicate that the adsorption energies of CO* and the energy barriers of forming key C2 intermediates are strongly correlated with nitrogen vacancy density. The Cu3Nx catalyst with abundant nitrogen vacancies presents one of the highest Faradaic efficiencies toward C2 products of 81.7&#160;&#177; 2.3% at &#8722;1.15&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (without ohmic correction), corresponding to the partial current density for C2 production as &#8722;307&#160;&#177; 9 mA cm&#8722;2. An outstanding electrochemical stability is also demonstrated at high current densities, substantially exceeding CuOx catalysts with oxygen vacancies. The work suggests an attractive approach to create stable anion vacancies as catalytic centers toward multicarbon products in electrochemical CO2 reduction.

         <title>Truth and Myth of Phase Coexistence in Methylammonium Lead Iodide Perovskite Thin Film via Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites have attracted substantial interest as the most favorable prospective material for efficient photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices. However, their extreme sensitivity to electron beam radiation makes it difficult to obtain their intrinsic structure by transmission electron microscopy and can even lead to significant misidentifications. In 2018, the coexistence of methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) in the cubic and tetragonal phase using electron microscopy and electron diffraction techniques was reported in article &#8220;Self&#8208;Organized Superlattice and Phase Coexistence inside Thin Film Organometal Halide Perovskite&#8221;. Herein, however, that claim is challenged by comparing their experimental data to simulated diffraction patterns and arguing that their perovskite samples may have been damaged due to excessive electron beam irradiation. Consequently, true phase coexistence was not observed in that previously reported work, rather merely the decomposition products of MAPbI3.

Abstract
In response to the Comment on article &#8220;Self&#8208;Organized Superlattice and Phase Coexistence inside Thin Film Organometal Halide Perovskite&#8221;, it is suggested that the facts that the existence of hexagonal PbI2 is discrepant in 3D crystallographic interpretation and that observation of (01&#175;0) and (100) reflections occurs in general, together make the challenges that were raised in the published Comment less convincing. In addition, a new transmission electron microscopy method using direction&#8208;selective electron beam damage of the organometal halide perovskite is disclosed.

Photothermal Materials
In article number 2007761, Shiqi Wang, H&#233;lder Santos, and co&#8208;workers introduce a polyoxometalate {Mo154}&#8208;incorporating, dual&#8208;crosslinked dynamic hydrogel (Mo154Gel) formed by Schiff base and electrostatic interactions. Mo154Gel shows exceptional photothermal conversion, and pH&#8208; and near&#8208;infrared&#8208;laser&#8208;triggered drug release. This work paves the way for the development of novel {Mo154}&#8208;based platforms incorporated in self&#8208;healing and injectable hydrogels for combinatorial chemo&#8208;photothermal cancer therapy.

Cancer Therapy
A two&#8208;edged&#8208;sword strategy for anticancer and chondroprotective treatment is approached by combining two key players, as reported by Mi&#8208;Lan Kang, Hak&#8208;Joon Sung, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2101558. Cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;derived nanoparticles (CMNPs) induce hypoxic cell&#8211;cell packing seen commonly in cancer growth and chondrogenesis. Notch&#8208;1 suppressor display on CMNPs inhibits angiogenesis efficiently, thereby promoting anticancer growth and prochondrogenesis simultaneously. This study suggests an unprecedented therapeutic strategy for laryngeal cancer which damages cartilage progressively.

Tendon Repair
Piezoelectricity is present in all living beings and provides the basis for mechanisms of tissue regeneration. In article number 2008788, Marc A. Fernandez&#8208;Yague, Manus J. Biggs, and co&#8208;workers show that tendon cell function can be controlled by electrical stimulation and introduce a new implantable stimulator device powered by body movement paving the way for a new class of regenerative electrical therapies without the use of drugs or external stimulation.

Optoelectronic Synapses
In article number 2102980, a flexible optoelectronic synapse fabricated on 2D van der Waals (vdW) layered rhenium disulfide, which features an inherent photosensitive memory nature derived from the persistent photoconductivity effect, is presented by Yong&#8208;Hoon Kim, Jin&#8208;Hong Park, and co&#8208;workers. After in&#8208;depth analysis including density functional theory calculations on rhenium disulfide, its feasibility for a hardware neural network with learning ability is also demonstrated using a convolutional neural network composed of vdW optoelectronic synapses.

The wedge&#8208;shaped wettability patterns of the patch are inspired by spines of cacti; the channel shape, in combination with the superhydrophobic/superhydrophilic surface materials, induces a unidirectional Laplace pressure that transports the sweat to the sensing&#8208;area fast and spontaneously.

Collodial Gradient Materials
Colloidal gradient materials introduce local variation of the physical properties to well&#8208;established colloidal crystals. In article number 2101948, Markus Retsch and co&#8208;workers describe a method to fabricate such colloidal gradient materials. Using such structures as time&#8211;temperature integrating sensors is just one application that showcases the potential of this materials class.

         <title>Polymorphic Phases of Metal Chlorides in the Confined 2D Space of Bilayer Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Unprecedented two&#8208;dimensional (2D) metal chloride structures were grown between sheets of bilayer graphene through intercalation of metal and chlorine atoms. Numerous spatially confined 2D phases of AlCl3 and CuCl2 distinct from their typical bulk forms were found, and the transformations between these new phases under the electron beam were directly observed by in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). Our density functional theory calculations confirmed the metastability of the atomic structures derived from the STEM experiments and provided insights into the electronic properties of the phases, which range from insulators to semimetals. Additionally, the co&#8208;intercalation of different metal chlorides was found to create completely new hybrid systems; in&#8208;plane quasi&#8208;1D AlCl3/CuCl2 heterostructures were obtained. The existence of polymorphic phases hints at the unique possibilities for fabricating new types of 2D materials with diverse electronic properties confined between graphene sheets.

         <title>Gradient H&#8208;bonding Binder Enables Stable High&#8208;Areal&#8208;Capacity Si&#8208;Based Anodes in Pouch Cells</title>

Abstract
Alleviating large stress is critical for high&#8208;energy batteries with large volume change upon cycling, yet this still presents a challenge. Here, we report a gradient hydrogen&#8208;bonding binder for high&#8208;capacity silicon&#8208;based anodes that are highly desirable for the next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The well&#8208;defined gradient hydrogen bonds, with a successive bond energy of &#8211;2.88 &#8764; &#8211;10.04&#160;kcal mol&#8211;1, can effectively release the large stress of silicon via the sequential bonding cleavage. This can avoid recurrently abrupt structure fracture of traditional binder due to lack of gradient energy dissipation. Certainly, this regulated binder endows stable high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity silicon&#8208;based electrodes &gt;3&#160;mAh cm&#8211;2. Beyond proof of concept, this work demonstrates a 2 Ah silicon&#8208;based pouch cell with an impressive capacity retention of 80.2% after 700 cycles (0.028% decay/cycle) based on this gradient hydrogen&#8208;bonding binder, making it more promising for practical application.

         <title>Digital Light Processing&#8208;based Bioprinting with Composable Gradients</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recapitulation of complex tissues signifies a remarkable challenge and, to date, only few approaches have emerged that can efficiently reconstruct necessary gradients in three&#8208;dimensional (3D) constructs. This is true even though mimicry of these gradients is of great importance to establish the functionality of engineered tissues and devices. Here, a composable&#8208;gradient digital light processing (DLP)&#8208;based (bio)printing system is developed for the first time, utilizing the unprecedented integration of a microfluidic mixer for the generation of either continual or discrete gradients of desired (bio)inks in real time. Notably, the precisely controlled gradients are composable on&#8208;the&#8208;fly by facilely adjusting the (bio)ink flow ratios. In addition, this setup is designed in such a way that no washing steps are needed when exchanging the gradient (bio)inks, further enhancing our time&#8208; and (bio)ink&#8208;saving strategy. Various planar and 3D structures exhibiting continual gradients of materials, of cell densities, of growth factor concentrations, of hydrogel stiffness, and of porosities in horizontal and/or vertical direction, are exemplified. The composable fabrication of multifunctional gradients strongly support the potential of our unique bioprinting system in numerous biomedical applications.

         <title>Solution&#8208;Processed Perovskite Field&#8208;Effect Transistor Artificial Synapses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Metal halide perovskites are distinctive semiconductors that exhibit both ionic and electronic transport and are promising for artificial synapses. However, developing a 3&#8208;terminal transistor artificial synapse with the perovskite channel remains elusive due to the lack of a proper technique to regulate mobile ions in a non&#8208;volatile manner. Here, we report solution&#8208;processed perovskite transistor for artificial synapses through the implementation of a ferroelectric gate. The ferroelectric polarisation provides a non&#8208;volatile electric field on the perovskite, leading to fixation of the mobile ions and hence modulation of the electronic conductance of the channel. Multi&#8208;state channel conductance is realized by partial ferroelectric polarisation. The ferroelectric&#8208;gated perovskite transistor is successfully used as an artificial synapse that emulates basic synaptic functions such as long&#8208;term plasticity with excellent linearity, short&#8208;term as well as spike&#8208;timing&#8208;dependent plasticity. Our strategy to regulate ion dynamics in the perovskites using the ferroelectric gate suggests a generic route to employ perovskites for synaptic electronics.

         <title>Facet&#8208;dependent Surface Charge and Hydration of Semiconducting Nanoparticles at Variable pH</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Understanding structure and function of solid&#8208;liquid interfaces is essential for the development of nanomaterials for various applications including heterogeneous catalysis in liquid phase processes and water splitting for storage of renewable electricity. The characteristic anisotropy of crystalline nanoparticles is believed to be essential for their performance but remains poorly understood and difficult to characterize. We use dual scale Atomic Force Microscopy to measure electrostatic and hydration forces of faceted semiconducting SrTiO3 nanoparticles in aqueous electrolyte at variable pH. We demonstrate (i) the ability to quantify strongly facet&#8208;dependent surface charges yielding isoelectric points of the dominant {100} and {110} facets that differ by as much as 2&#160;pH units, ii) facet&#8208;dependent accumulation of oppositely charged (SiO2) particles, and iii) that atomic scale defects can be resolved but are in fact rare for the samples investigated. Atomically resolved images and facet&#8208;dependent oscillatory hydration forces suggest a microscopic charge generation mechanism that explains colloidal scale electrostatic forces.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding structure and function of solid-liquid interfaces is essential for the development of nanomaterials for various applications including heterogeneous catalysis in liquid phase processes and water splitting for storage of renewable electricity. The characteristic anisotropy of crystalline nanoparticles is believed to be essential for their performance but remains poorly understood and difficult to characterize. We use dual scale Atomic Force Microscopy to measure electrostatic and hydration forces of faceted semiconducting SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles in aqueous electrolyte at variable pH. We demonstrate (i) the ability to quantify strongly facet-dependent surface charges yielding isoelectric points of the dominant {100} and {110} facets that differ by as much as 2&#160;pH units, ii) facet-dependent accumulation of oppositely charged (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) particles, and iii) that atomic scale defects can be resolved but are in fact rare for the samples investigated. Atomically resolved images and facet-dependent oscillatory hydration forces suggest a microscopic charge generation mechanism that explains colloidal scale electrostatic forces.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Lead&#8208;Dominated Hyperfine Interaction Impacting the Carrier Spin Dynamics in Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
The outstanding optical quality of lead halide perovskites inspires studies of their potential for the optical control of carrier spins as pursued in other materials. Entering largely uncharted territory, time&#8208;resolved pump&#8208;probe Kerr rotation is used to explore the coherent spin dynamics of electrons and holes in bulk FA0.9Cs0.1PbI2.8Br0.2 and to determine key parameters characterizing their spins interactions, such as the g&#8208;factors and relaxation times. The demonstrated long spin dynamics and narrow g&#8208;factor distribution prove the perovskites as promising competitors for conventional semiconductors in spintronics. The dynamic nuclear polarization via spin&#8208;oriented holes is realized and the identification of the 207Pb isotope in optically&#8208;detected nuclear magnetic resonance proves that the hole&#8208;nuclei interaction is dominated by the lead ions. A detailed theoretical analysis accounting for the specifics of the lead halide perovskite materials allows the evaluation of the underlying hyperfine interaction constants, both for electrons and holes. Recombination and spin dynamics evidence that at low temperatures photogenerated electrons and holes are localized at different regions of the perovskite crystal, resulting in their long lifetimes up to 44&#160;&#956;s. Our&#160;findings form the base for the tailored development of spin&#8208;optoelectronic applications for the large family of lead halide perovskites and their&#160;nanostructures.

         <title>Training the Polarization in Integrated La0.15Bi0.85FeO3&#8208;Based Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
The functionalities of BiFeO3&#8208;based magnetoelectric multiferroic heterostructures rely on the controlled manipulation of its ferroelectric domains and of the corresponding net in&#8208;plane polarization, as this aspect guides the voltage&#8208;controlled magnetic switching. Chemical substitution has emerged as a key to push the energy dissipation of the BiFeO3 into the attojoule range but appears to result in a disordered domain configuration. Using non&#8208;invasive optical second&#8208;harmonic generation on heavily La&#8208;substituted BiFeO3 films, we show that a weak net in&#8208;plane polarization remains imprinted in the pristine films despite the apparent domain disorder. We find that this ingrained net in&#8208;plane polarization can be trained with out&#8208;of&#8208;plane electric fields compatible with applications. Operando studies on capacitor heterostructures treated in this way show the full restoration of the domain configuration of pristine BiFeO3 along with a giant net in&#8208;plane polarization enhancement. Thus, our experiments reveal a surprising robustness of the net in&#8208;plane polarization of BiFeO3 against chemical modification, an important criterion in ongoing attempts to integrate magnetoelectric materials into energy&#8208;efficient devices.

         <title>3D Printing Scaffold Vaccine for Antitumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cancer vaccine platform has attracted great interest in the field of cancer immunotherapy. Here, we developed a 3D printed scaffolds loaded with immunoregulators for enhanced cancer immunotherapy. The rapid manufacturing and precise molding based on 3D printing can realize the mass manufacturing of cancer vaccines and personalized design. Meanwhile, compared to the traditional hydrogel, the 3D&#8208;scaffold with porous structure endowed it similar functions compared with real lymphoid organs by recruitment of a great number of immune cells, leading to the formation of &#8220;artificial tertiary lymphoid structures (aTLS)&#8221;, where is a promising site to enhance both humoral and cellular immune responses. Efficient anticancer immunity is induced when combined with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) to inhibit the tumor growth. We further demonstrate personalized anti&#8208;tumor scaffold vaccines for filling of tumor site after surgery to prevent cancer metastasis. Taken together, these results promise the 3D printing scaffold vaccine as the potential strategy for cancer vaccine therapy in the future.

         <title>Acoustophoretic Liquefaction For 3D Printing Ultrahigh Viscosity Nanoparticle Suspensions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
An acoustic liquefaction approach to enhance the flow of yield stress fluids during digital light processing (DLP) based 3D printing is reported. This enhanced flow enables processing of ultrahigh viscosity resins (&#956;app &gt;&#160;3700 Pa&#183;s at shear rates &#947; = 0.01 s&#8211;1) based on silica particles in a silicone photopolymer. Numerical simulations of the acousto&#8208;mechanical coupling in the DLP resin feed system at different agitation frequencies predicts local resin flow velocities exceeding 100 mm&#183;s&#8211;1 at acoustic transduction frequencies of 110 s&#8211;1. Under these conditions, highly loaded particle suspensions (weight fractions, f = 0.23) can be printed successfully in complex geometries. Such mechanically reinforced composites possess a tensile toughness 2000% greater than the neat photopolymer. Beyond an increase in processible viscosities, acoustophoretic liquefaction DLP (AL&#8208;DLP) creates a transient reduction in apparent viscosity that promotes resin recirculation and decreases viscous adhesion. As a result, AL&#8208;DLP improves the printed feature resolution by more than 25%, increases printable object sizes by over 50 times, and can build parts &gt;&#160;3 &#215; faster when compared to conventional methodologies.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Thermal Switching of Individual Plasmonically Activated Spin Crossover Nanoparticle Imaged by Ultrafast Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin Crossover (SCO) is a promising switching phenomenon when implemented in electronic devices as molecules, thin films or nanoparticles. Among the properties modulated along this phenomenon, optically induced mechanical changes are of tremendous importance as they can work as fast light&#8208;induced mechanical switches or allow to investigate and control microstructural strains and fatigability. The development of characterization techniques probing nanoscopic behaviour with high spatio&#8208;temporal resolution allows to trigger and visualize such mechanical changes of individual nanoscopic objects. Here we use Ultrafast Transmission Electron Microscopy (UTEM) to precisely probe the length changes of individual switchable nanoparticles induced thermally by nanosecond laser pulses. This allows us to reveal the mechanisms of spin switching, leading to the macroscopic expansion of SCO materials. This study was conducted on individual pure SCO nanoparticles and SCO nanoparticles encapsulating gold nanorods that serve for plasmonic heating under laser pulses. Length changes are compared with time&#8208;resolved optical measurements performed on an assembly of these particles.

Gene therapy has shown great potential for neurodegenerative diseases with complex pathology. However, its therapeutic effect is limited due to the delivery barriers and its own single function. Herein, self&#8208;catalytic small interfering RNA (siRNA) nanocarriers (S/Ce&#8208;PABMS) are developed to catalyze delivery process and treatment process for synergistic treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. On the one hand, the rough surface of S/Ce&#8208;PABMS mediated by ceria (CeO2) nanozymes can catalyze cellular uptake in the delivery process, so that S/Ce&#8208;PABMS with acetylcholine analogs penetrate the blood&#8208;brain barrier and enter neurons more effectively. On the other hand, CeO2 nanozymes can catalyze the treatment process by scavenging excess reactive oxygen species, and cooperate with siRNA targeting SNCA to decrease the &#945;&#8208;synuclein (&#945;&#8208;syn) aggregation and alleviate the parkinsonian pathology. Moreover, the S/Ce&#8208;PABMS treatment reduces the number of activated microglia and regulates the release of inflammatory cytokine, thereby relieving neuroinflammation. After treatment with S/Ce&#8208;PABMS, dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease model mice has been significantly alleviated. The finding shows that the self&#8208;catalytic nanocarriers S/Ce&#8208;PABMS have great potential in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

         <title>Coupling Spin Defects in a Layered Material to Nanoscale Plasmonic Cavities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin defects in hexagonal boron nitride, and specifically the negatively charged boron vacancy (VB&#8211;) centres, are emerging candidates for quantum sensing. However, the VB&#8211; defects suffer from low quantum efficiency and as a result exhibit weak photoluminescence. In this work, we demonstrate a scalable approach to dramatically enhance the VB&#8211; emission by coupling to a plasmonic gap cavity. The plasmonic cavity is composed of a flat gold surface and a silver cube, with few&#8208;layer hBN flakes positioned in between. Employing these plasmonic cavities, we extracted two orders of magnitude in photoluminescence enhancement associated with a corresponding 2&#8208;fold enhancement in optically detected magnetic resonance contrast. The work will be pivotal to progress in quantum sensing employing 2D materials, and realisation of nanophotonic devices with spin defects in hexagonal boron nitride.

         <title>Low&#8208;bandgap Organic Bulk&#8208;heterojunction Enabled Efficient and Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lead halide perovskite and organic solar cells (PSCs and OSCs) are considered as the prime candidates currently for clean energy applications due to their solution and low&#8208;temperature processibility. Nevertheless, the substantial photon loss in near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region and relatively large photovoltage deficit need to be improved to enable their uses in high&#8208;performance solar cells. To mitigate these disadvantages, we integrate low&#8208;bandgap organic bulk&#8208;heterojunction (BHJ) layer into inverted PSCs to construct facile hybrid solar cells (HSCs). By optimizing the BHJ components, we achieve an excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.80%, with a decent open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.146&#160;V and extended photo&#8208;response over 950&#160;nm for rigid HSCs. The resultant devices also exhibit superior long&#8208;term (over 1000 h) ambient&#8208; and photo&#8208;stability compared to those from single&#8208;component PSCs and OSCs. More importantly, a champion PCE of 21.73% and excellent mechanical durability can also be achieved in flexible HSCs, which is the highest efficiency reported for flexible solar cells to date. Taking advantage of these impressive device performance, we have successfully integrated flexible HSCs into a power source for wearable sensors to demonstrate real&#8208;time temperature monitoring.

         <title>Synthesis of Pd3Sn and PdCuSn Nanorods with L12 Phase for Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic Ethanol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystal phase of nanomaterials is one of the key parameters to determine their physicochemical property and performance in various applications. However, it still remains a great challenge to synthesize nanomaterials with different crystal phases while maintaining the same composition, size and morphology. Here, we report a facile, one&#8208;pot, wet&#8208;chemical method to synthesize Pd3Sn nanorods with the comparable size and morphology but different crystal phases, i.e., the ordered intermetallic and disordered alloy with the L12 and face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) phases, respectively. The crystal phase of the as&#8208;synthesized Pd3Sn nanorods is easily tuned by altering the types of tin precursors and solvents. Moreover, our approach can also be used to synthesize ternary PdCuSn nanorods with the L12 crystal phase. When used as electrocatalysts, the L12 Pd3Sn nanorods exhibit superior electrocatalytic performance towards the ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) compared to their fcc counterpart. Impressively, compared to the L12 Pd3Sn nanorods, the ternary L12 PdCuSn nanorods exhibit more enhanced electrocatalytic performance towards EOR, yielding a high mass current density up to 6.22 A mgPd&#8211;1, which are superior to the commercial Pd/C catalyst and among the best reported Pd&#8208;based EOR electrocatalysts.

         <title>Quantifying Anionic Diffusion in Two&#8208;Dimensional Halide Perovskites Lateral Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anionic diffusion strongly impacts the stability of halide perovskite materials, but it is still not well&#8208;understood. Here, we report a quantitative investigation of in&#8208;plane thermally driven anionic inter&#8208;diffusion in a series of novel 2D and quasi&#8208;2D halide perovskites lateral heterostructures. The calculated diffusion coefficients (D) reveal the inhibition of Br&#8208;I inter&#8208;diffusion with bulky &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic cations compared with short&#8208;chain aliphatic organic cations. Furthermore, halide diffusion was found to be faster in quasi&#8208;2D (n &gt;&#160;1) than 2D perovskites (n = 1). The increment becomes less apparent as the &#8220;n&#8221; number increases, akin to the quantum confinement effect observed for band gaps. These trends are rationalized by molecular dynamics simulations of free energy barriers for halide diffusion that reveal mechanisms for suppressing diffusion. This work provides important fundamental insights on the anionic migration and diffusion process in halide perovskite materials.

         <title>Chirality Bias Tissue Homeostasis By Manipulating Immunological Response</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
The physiological chirality of extracellular environments is substantially affected by pathological diseases. However, how this stereochemical variation drives host immunity remains poorly understood. Here, we report that pathology&#8208;mimetic M&#8208;nanofibrils&#8212;but not physiology&#8208;mimetic P&#8208;nanofibrils&#8212;act as a defense mechanism that helps to restore tissue homeostasis by manipulating immunological response. Quantitative multi&#8208;omics in vivo and in vitro showed that M&#8208;nanofibrils significantly inhibited inflammation and promoted tissue regeneration by upregulating M2 macrophage polarization and downstream immune signaling compared with P&#8208;nanofibrils. Molecular analysis and theoretical simulation demonstrated that M&#8208;chirality displayed higher stereo&#8208;affinity to cellular binding, which induced higher cellular contractile stress and activated mechanosensitive ion channel PIEZOl to conduct Ca2+ influx. In turn, the nuclear transfer of STAT was biased by Ca2+ influx to promote M2 polarization. These findings underscore the structural mechanisms of disease, providing design basis for immunotherapy with bionic functional materials.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Molybdenum Carbide MXenes for Enhanced Selective Detection of Humidity in Air</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;dimensional transition metal carbides and nitrides (MXenes) open up novel opportunities in gas sensing with high sensitivity at room temperature. Herein, we have successfully synthesized 2D Mo2CTx flakes with high aspect ratio. We study the chemiresistive effect in a sub&#8208;&#956;m MXene multilayer for different organic vapors and humidity at 101&#8211;104&#160;ppm in dry air. Reasonably, the low&#8208;noise resistance signal allows the detection of H2O down to 10&#160;ppm. Moreover, humidity suppresses the response of Mo2CTx to organic analytes due to the blocking of adsorption active sites. By measuring the impedance of MXene layers as a function of ac frequency in the 10&#8722;2&#8208;106&#160;Hz range, we show that operation principle of the sensor is dominated by resistance change rather than capacitance variations. The sensor transfer function allows us to conclude that the Mo2CTx chemiresistance is mainly originating from electron transport through inter&#8208;flake potential barriers with heights up to 0.2&#160;eV. DFT calculations, elucidating the Mo2C surface interaction with organic analytes and H2O, explain the experimental data as an energy shift of the density of states under the analyte's adsorption which induces increasing electrical resistance.

         <title>Ten Years of Progress in the Synthesis and Development of MXenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transition metal carbides and nitrides (MXenes) are among the largest 2D material families. MXenes&#8217; unique properties, such as their metal&#8208;like electrical conductivity, render them quite useful in a large number of applications including energy storage, optoelectronic, biomedical, communications, and environmental. A brief historical overview of the first 10 years of MXene research and a perspective on their synthesis and future development are provided.








Abstract
Since their discovery in 2011, the number of 2D transition metal carbides and nitrides (MXenes) has steadily increased. Currently more than 40 MXene compositions exist. The ultimate number is far greater and in time they may develop into the largest family of 2D materials known. MXenes&#8217; unique properties, such as their metal&#8208;like electrical conductivity reaching &#8776;20&#160;000 S cm&#8722;1, render them quite useful in a large number of applications, including energy storage, optoelectronic, biomedical, communications, and environmental. The number of MXene papers and patents published has been growing quickly. The first MXene generation is synthesized using selective etching of metal layers from the MAX phases, layered transition metal carbides and carbonitrides using hydrofluoric acid. Since then, multiple synthesis approaches have been developed, including selective etching in a mixture of fluoride salts and various acids, non&#8208;aqueous etchants, halogens, and molten salts, allowing for the synthesis of new MXenes with better control over their surface chemistries. Herein, a brief historical overview of the first 10 years of MXene research and a perspective on their synthesis and future development are provided. The fact that their production is readily scalable in aqueous environments, with high yields bodes well for their commercialization.

         <title>Micropatterns Fabricated by Photodimerization&#8208;Induced Diffusion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward yet powerful strategy to fabricate micropatterns on film surfaces is developed by spatially regulating the photodimerization and mass transport of maleimide. This technology integrates the characteristics of top&#8208;down and bottom&#8208;up methods, providing a versatile basis for applications in microfluidic channels, composite gratings, devices, and functional systems.








Abstract
Pattern technology plays an important role in the generation of microstructures with different functionalities and morphologies. In this report, a straightforward and versatile strategy is presented for spatially regulating the growth of a microstructure on a surface by the photodimerization of maleimide (MI). Upon exposure of ultraviolet (UV) light, photodimerization of MI in a film comprising furan&#8208;grafted polymer and bismaleimide (BMI) produces a chemical gradient, which can drive the diffusion of BMI from the unexposed to the exposed region and from the bottom to the surface, resulting in the growth of micropatterns. Sequential crosslinking induced by the Diels&#8211;Alder reaction between MI and furan maintains the stability of pattern shape. Theoretical modeling with reaction&#8208;diffusion equations reveal that as photodimerization moves the system far from thermodynamic equilibrium, the formation of a chemical potential gradient requires the redistribution of matter, resulting in the formation of topographies. Directional molecular motion induced by UV light can generate complex morphology, and produce materials with unique optical functions, such as charming&#8208;ordered gratings. This straightforward method of fabricating micropatterns by photodimerization&#8208;induced diffusion is successfully applied to patterned curved surfaces, microfluidic channels and encapsulation of integrated light emitting diode chips.

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Covalent Organic Framework Cathodes for Enhanced Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precise molecular manipulation of redox&#8208;active groups in covalent organic framework (COF) units shows that quinone&#8208;functionalized COFs significantly enhance the specific capacity, elevate the discharge potential, and improve the competitiveness of Zn2+ against H+ intercalation through a stronger coordination bond between cations and C&#63742;O/C&#63742;N groups.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are potentially promising electrode materials for electrochemical charge storage applications thanks to their pre&#8208;designable reticular chemistry with atomic precision, allowing precise control of pore size, redox&#8208;active functional moieties, and stable covalent frameworks. However, studies on the mechanistic and practical aspects of their zinc&#8208;ion storage behavior are still limited. In this study, a strategy to enhance the electrochemical performance of COF cathodes in zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) by introducing the quinone group into 1,4,5,8,9,12&#8208;hexaazatriphenylene&#8208;based COFs is reported. Electrochemical characterization demonstrates that the introduction of the quinone groups in the COF significantly pushes up the Zn2+ storage capability against H+ and elevates the average (dis&#8208;)charge potential in aqueous ZIBs. Computational and experimental analysis further reveals the favorable redox&#8208;active sites that host Zn2+/H+ in COF electrodes and the root cause for the enhanced electrochemical performance. This work demonstrates that molecular engineering of the COF structure is an effective approach to achieve practical charge storage performance.

         <title>Synergistic Effects of Eu&#8208;MOF on Perovskite Solar Cells with Improved Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Eu&#8208;MOF is introduced to the field of perovskite solar cells. Both Eu ions and organic ligands reduce the defect concentration. More over, due to the F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer effect, Eu&#8208;MOF improves the light utilization. Meanwhile, it also turns tensile strain to compressive strain. Finally, the device performance, in efficiency and stability, is increased dramatically due to the synergetic effects.








Abstract
Enhancing device lifetime is one of the essential challenges in perovskite solar cells. The ultrathin Eu&#8208;MOF layer is introduced at the interface between the electron&#8208;transport layer and the perovskite absorber to improve the device stability. Both Eu ions and organic ligands in the MOF can reduce the defect concentration and improve carrier transport. Moreover, due to the F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer effect, Eu&#8208;MOF in perovskite films can improve light utilization and reduce the decomposition under ultraviolet light. Meanwhile, Eu&#8208;MOF also turns tensile strain to compressive strain in the perovskite films. As a result, the corresponding devices achieve a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.16%. In addition, the devices retain 96% of their original PCE after 2000 h under the relative humidity of 30% and 91% of their original PCE after 1200 h after continuous 85&#160;&#176;C aging condition in N2.

More over, due to the F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer effect, Eu-MOF improves the light utilization. Meanwhile, it also turns tensile strain to compressive strain. Finally, the device performance, in efficiency and stability, is increased dramatically due to the synergetic effects.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enhancing device lifetime is one of the essential challenges in perovskite solar cells. The ultrathin Eu-MOF layer is introduced at the interface between the electron-transport layer and the perovskite absorber to improve the device stability. Both Eu ions and organic ligands in the MOF can reduce the defect concentration and improve carrier transport. Moreover, due to the F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer effect, Eu-MOF in perovskite films can improve light utilization and reduce the decomposition under ultraviolet light. Meanwhile, Eu-MOF also turns tensile strain to compressive strain in the perovskite films. As a result, the corresponding devices achieve a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.16%. In addition, the devices retain 96% of their original PCE after 2000 h under the relative humidity of 30% and 91% of their original PCE after 1200 h after continuous 85&#160;&#176;C aging condition in N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bitter Flavored, Soft Composites for Wearables Designed to Reduce Risks of Choking in Infants</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bitter&#8208;flavored formulations in soft encapsulating layers and hydrogel adhesives for skin&#8208;interfaced wireless devices reduce risks of choking with infants. A bitter dopant, denatonium benzoate, integrated into soft silicone elastomers and hydrogels triggers a reflexive response when dissolved in saliva. Demonstrations in a variety of devices for physiological monitoring highlight the compatibility of these unusual composite materials in clinical&#8208;grade wearables.








Abstract
Wireless, skin&#8208;integrated devices for continuous, clinical&#8208;quality monitoring of vital signs have the potential to greatly improve the care of patients in neonatal and pediatric intensive&#8208;care units. These same technologies can also be used in the home, across a broad spectrum of ages, from beginning to end of life. Although miniaturized forms of such devices minimize patient burden and improve compliance, they represent life&#8208;threatening choking hazards for infants. A materials strategy is presented here to address this concern. Specifically, composite materials are introduced as soft encapsulating layers and gentle adhesives that release chemical compounds designed to elicit an intense bitter taste when placed in the mouth. Reflexive reactions to this sensation strongly reduce the potential for ingestion, as a safety feature. The materials systems described involve a non&#8208;toxic bitterant (denatonium benzoate) as a dopant in an elastomeric (poly(dimethylsiloxane)) or hydrogel matrix. Experimental and computational studies of these composite materials and the kinetics of release of the bitterant define the key properties. Incorporation into various wireless skin&#8208;integrated sensors demonstrates their utility in functional systems. This simple strategy offers valuable protective capabilities, with broad practical relevance to the welfare of children monitored with wearable devices.

         <title>A Highly Compressible and Stretchable Carbon Spring for Smart Vibration and Magnetism Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous spring&#8208;like all&#8208;carbon material achieving both elastic compressibility and stretchability at large strain from &#8722;80% to 80% is obtained when a unique long&#8208;range lamellar multi&#8208;arch microstructure is designed. The excellent mechanical performance combined with the intrinsic advantages of carbon makes it a promising platform for making smart vibration and magnetism sensors that can work at extreme temperatures.








Abstract
Porous carbon materials demonstrate extensive applications for their attractive characteristics. Mechanical flexibility is an essential property guaranteeing their durability. After decades of research efforts, compressive brittleness of porous carbon materials is well resolved. However, reversible stretchability remains challenging to achieve due to the intrinsically weak connections and fragile joints of the porous carbon networks. Herein, it is presented that a porous all&#8208;carbon material achieving both elastic compressibility and stretchability at large strain from &#8722;80% to 80% can be obtained when a unique long&#8208;range lamellar multi&#8208;arch microstructure is introduced. Impressively, the porous all&#8208;carbon material can maintain reliable structural robustness and durability under loading condition of cyclic compressing&#8211;stretching process, similar to a real metallic spring. The unique performance renders it as a promising platform for making smart vibration and magnetism sensors, even capable of operating at extreme temperatures. Furthermore, this study provides valuable insights for creating highly stretchable and compressible porous materials from other neat inorganic components for diverse applications in future.

         <title>Hollow InVO4 Nanocuboid Assemblies toward Promoting Photocatalytic N2 Conversion Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The InVO4 superstructure with a cube&#8208;shaped skeleton and hollow interior is synthesized. The closely ordered assembly of nanocuboids improves the separation of electron&#8211;hole pairs through promoted charge transfer among neighboring building blocks. This promising charge mobility feature contributes to the pronounced photocatalytic performance of InVO4 superstrucure toward N2 fixation into NH3.








Abstract
The unique InVO4 mesocrystal superstructure, particularly with cubical skeleton and hollow interior, which consists of numerous nanocube building blocks, closely stacking by stacking, aligning by aligning, and sharing the same crystallographic orientations, is successfully fabricated. The synergy of a reaction&#8208;limited aggregation and an Ostwald ripening process is reasonably proposed for the growth of this unique superstructure. Both single&#8208;particle surface photovoltage and confocal fluorescence spectroscopy measurements demonstrate that the long&#8208;range ordered mesocrystal superstructures can significantly retard the recombination of electron&#8211;hole pairs through the creation of a new pathway for anisotropic electron flow along the inter&#8208;nanocubes. This promising charge mobility feature of the superstructure greatly contributes to the pronounced photocatalytic performance of the InVO4 mesocrystal toward fixation of N2 into NH3 with the quantum yield of 0.50% at wavelength of 385&#160;nm.

         <title>Ultrafast Bubble Bursting by Superamphiphobic Coatings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superamphiphobic surfaces for ultrafast bubble bursting are introduced. Liquid flame spray is fast and scalable, and allows tuning of the nano&#8208; and micrometer&#8208;scale architecture of hierarchical surface structures. Bubbles burst rapidly upon contact and the gas is absorbed into the surface structures. The recorded rates are enhanced by a factor of 3 relative to previously reported results.








Abstract
Controlling bubble motion or passively bursting bubbles using solid interfaces is advantageous in numerous industrial applications including flotation, catalysis, electrochemical processes, and microfluidics. Current research has explored the formation, dissolution, pinning, and rupturing of bubbles on different surfaces. However, the ability to tune and control the rate of bubble bursting is not yet achieved. Scaling down surface&#8208;induced bubble bursting to just a few milliseconds is important for any application. In this work, the hierarchical structure of superamphiphobic surfaces is tuned in order to rapidly rupture contacting bubbles. Surfaces prepared using liquid flame spray show ultrafast bubble bursting (down to 2&#160;ms) and superior durability. The coatings demonstrate excellent mechanical and chemical stability even in the presence of surface&#8208;active species. Air from the ruptured bubble is absorbed into the aerophilic Cassie&#8208;state. Long&#8208;term applicability is demonstrated by preventing the accumulation of air in the plastron via a connection of the plastron to the environment. The times recorded for bubble rupture and complete reorganization of air are reduced by approximately a factor of 3 compared to previously reported values. The concept is utilized to passively control surfactant&#8208;rich foam in froth flotation. Material collection efficiency increased by more than 60&#160;times compared to controls.

         <title>Synaptic Plasticity Powering Long&#8208;Afterglow Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synaptic indium&#8208;gallium&#8208;zinc&#8208;oxide (IGZO) layer is integrated into a novel organic light&#8208;emitting transistor (OLET) device. The UV&#8208;light&#8208;driven photoinduced synaptic effect is used to power a persistent bright afterglow emission in an organic light&#8208;emitting material. The unique OLETs are integrated in active&#8208;matrix light&#8208;emitting arrays operating as visual UV sensors capable of long&#8208;lifetime green&#8208;light emission in the irradiated regions.








Abstract
Long&#8208;lasting luminescence in optoelectronic devices is highly sought after for applications in optical data storage and display technology. While in light&#8208;emitting diodes this is achieved by exploiting long&#8208;afterglow organic materials as active components, such a strategy has never been pursued in light&#8208;emitting transistors, which are still rather unexplored and whose technological potential is yet to be demonstrated. Herein, the fabrication of long&#8208;afterglow organic light&#8208;emitting transistors (LAOLETs) is reported whose operation relies on an unprecedented strategy based on a photoinduced synaptic effect in an inorganic indium&#8208;gallium&#8208;zinc&#8208;oxide (IGZO) semiconducting channel layer, to power a persistent electroluminescence in organic light&#8208;emitting materials. Oxygen vacancies in the IGZO layer, produced by irradiation at &#955;&#160;= 312&#160;nm, free electrons in excess yielding to a channel conductance increase. Due to the slow recombination kinetics of photogenerated electrons to oxygen vacancies in the channel layer, the organic material can be fueled by postsynaptic current and displays a long&#8208;lived light&#8208;emission (hundreds of seconds) after ceasing UV irradiation. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the LAOLETs are integrated in active&#8208;matrix light&#8208;emitting arrays operating as visual UV sensors capable of long&#8208;lifetime green&#8208;light emission in the irradiated regions.

         <title>A Zwitterionic Polyurethane Nanoporous Device with Low Foreign&#8208;Body Response for Islet Encapsulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A zwitterionic nanofibrous islet encapsulation device made of sulfobetaine&#8208;modified polyurethane is reported. The device is mechanically robust, effective in preventing cell entrance or escape, hydrophilic with facile mass transfer, and biocompatible with low levels of fibrotic deposition in mice, dogs, and pigs. These attributes make it an attractive candidate for safe delivery of insulin&#8208;producing cells to treat type 1 diabetes.








Abstract
Encapsulation of insulin&#8208;producing cells is a promising strategy for treatment of type 1 diabetes. However, engineering an encapsulation device that is both safe (i.e., no cell escape and no breakage) and functional (i.e., low foreign&#8208;body response (FBR) and high mass transfer) remains a challenge. Here, a family of zwitterionic polyurethanes (ZPU) with sulfobetaine groups in the polymer backbone is developed, which are fabricated into encapsulation devices with tunable nanoporous structures via electrospinning. The ZPU encapsulation device is hydrophilic and fouling&#8208;resistant, exhibits robust mechanical properties, and prevents cell escape while still allowing efficient mass transfer. The ZPU device also induces a much lower FBR or cellular overgrowth upon intraperitoneal implantation in C57BL/6 mice for up to 6 months compared to devices made of similar polyurethane without the zwitterionic modification. The therapeutic potential of the ZPU device is shown for islet encapsulation and diabetes correction in mice for &#8776;3 months is demonstrated. As a proof of concept, the scalability and retrievability of the ZPU device in pigs and dogs are further demonstrated. Collectively, these attributes make ZPU devices attractive candidates for cell encapsulation therapies.

         <title>High&#8208;Strength and Nonfouling Zwitterionic Triple&#8208;Network Hydrogel in Saline Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective strategy is developed to achieve both high mechanical strength and excellent nonfouling properties in saline environments, important for biomedical and engineering applications, by constructing a pure zwitterionic triple&#8208;network hydrogel. Strong chain entanglement and electrostatic interactions provide effective energy dissipation to improve the mechanical strength and toughness of the hydrogel.








Abstract
Zwitterionic hydrogels have received great attention due to their excellent nonfouling and biocompatible properties, but they suffer from weak mechanical strength in the saline environments important for biomedical and engineering applications due to the &#8220;anti&#8208;polyelectrolyte&#8221; effect. Conventional strategies to introduce hydrophobic or non&#8208;zwitterionic components to increase mechanical strength compromise their nonfouling properties. Here, a highly effective strategy is reported to achieve both high mechanical strength and excellent nonfouling properties by constructing a pure zwitterionic triple&#8208;network (ZTN) hydrogel. The strong electrostatic interaction and network entanglement within the triple&#8208;network structure can effectively dissipate energy to toughen the hydrogel and achieve high strength, toughness, and stiffness in saline environments (compressive fracture stress 18.2 &#177; 1.4&#160;MPa,&#160;toughness 1.62 &#177; 0.03&#160;MJ m&#8211;3,&#160;and modulus 0.66 &#177; 0.03&#160;MPa&#160;in seawater environments). Moreover, the ZTN hydrogel is shown to strongly resist the attachment of proteins, bacteria, and cells. The results provide a fundamental understanding to guide the design of tough nonfouling zwitterionic hydrogels for a broad range of applications.

         <title>Modular Assembly of Tumor&#8208;Penetrating and Oligomeric Nanozyme Based on Intrinsically Self&#8208;Assembling Protein Nanocages</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
It remains challenging to precisely control and reproducibly formulate nanomedicines. A nanomaterial&#8208;based synthetic biology strategy is established for tailoring oligomeric nanostructures and a series of artificial metalloenzymes in a precisely controlled manner, which offers an option for tailored anticancer nanomedicines that have a high degree of control over both geometry and valency.








Abstract
Biomimetic design of nanomaterials with enzyme&#8208;like characteristics has emerged as a promising method for the generation of novel therapeutics. However, synthesis of nanomaterials while maintaining a high degree of control over both geometry and valency poses a prominent challenge. Herein, the authors introduce a nanomaterial&#8208;based synthetic biology strategy for accurate and quantitative tailoring of high&#8208;ordered nanostructures that uses a &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; hierarchical incorporation of protein building blocks. The assembled nano&#8208;oligomers possessed tunable protein motifs and multivalent binding domains, which facilitated prolonged blood circulation time, accumulation within tumor cells through direct targeting of cell receptors, and deep tumor tissue penetration via a transcytosis mechanism. Using these protein/protein nano&#8208;oligomers as scaffolds, the authors created a new series of artificial nano&#8208;scaled metalloenzymes (nanozymes) by the in situ incorporation of metal nanoclusters within the cavity of the protein nanocages. Nanozymes were&#160;capable of mimicking peroxidase&#8208;like activity and generated cytotoxic free radicals. Compared to nanozyme alone, the systemic delivery of oligomeric nanozymes demonstrated significantly enhanced therapeutic and anti&#8208;tumor benefits. This study shows a new insight into nanotechnology by taking advantage of synthetic biotechnology.

         <title>Hydrophilicity&#8208;Hydrophobicity Transformation, Thermoresponsive Morphomechanics, and Crack Multifurcation Revealed by AIEgens in Mechanically Strong Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The direct visualization of microphase separation and easy differentiation of hydrophilicity&#8211;hydrophobicity transformation is achieved in a facile, high&#8208;contrast, and noninvasive manner by using luminogens with aggregation&#8208;induced emission as fluorescent indicators. Based on the morphological observation and mechanical study, the concept of morphomechanics with a comprehensive mechanism clarification is proposed.








Abstract
Biomimetic exploration of stimuli&#8208;responsive and crack&#8208;resistant hydrogels is of great academic and practical significance, although the rational design of tough hydrogels is limited by insufficient mechanism study due to the lack of imaging techniques to &#8220;see&#8221; hydrogels at mesoscale level. A series of composite hydrogels with compartmentalized thermal response is designed by incorporating aggregation&#8208; and polarity&#8208;sensitive fluorescent probes in a poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) network grafted with poly(N,N&#8208;dimethylacrylamide) side&#8208;chains. The fluorescence technique is explored as a powerful tool to directly visualize their hydrophilicity&#8208;hydrophobicity transformation and the composition&#8208;dependent microphase separation. Based on the morphological observation and mechanical measurements, the concept of morphomechanics with a comprehensive mechanism clarification is proposed. In this regard, the thermoresponsive toughening is attributed to the formation of multiple noncovalent interactions and the conformational changes of PNIPAM chains. The enhanced fracture energy by crack multifurcation is related to the tearing&#8208;like disruption of weak interfaces between the separated phases.

Based on the morphological observation and mechanical measurements, the concept of morphomechanics with a comprehensive mechanism clarification is proposed. In this regard, the thermoresponsive toughening is attributed to the formation of multiple noncovalent interactions and the conformational changes of PNIPAM chains. The enhanced fracture energy by crack multifurcation is related to the tearing-like disruption of weak interfaces between the separated phases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metavalent Bonding in Crystalline Solids: How Does It Collapse?</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metavalent bonding in solids is shown to differ significantly from covalent bonding, as demonstrated by pronounced property changes for optical, vibrational, electronic, and structural properties upon the transition from covalent to metavalent bonding. This insight and the resulting map showing trends in chemical bonding and material properties can be used to design and tailor materials.








Abstract
The chemical bond is one of the most powerful, yet much debated concepts in chemistry, explaining property trends in solids. Recently, a novel type of chemical bonding was&#160;identified in several higher chalcogenides, characterized by a unique property portfolio, unconventional bond breaking, and sharing of about one electron between adjacent atoms. This metavalent bond is a fundamental type of bonding in solids, besides covalent, ionic, and metallic bonding, raising the pertinent question as to whether there is a well&#8208;defined transition between metavalent and covalent bonds. Here, three different pseudo&#8208;binary lines, namely, GeTe1&#8722;xSex, Sb2Te3(1&#8722;x)Se3x, and Bi2&#8722;2xSb2xSe3, are studied, and a sudden change in several properties, including optical absorption &#949;2(&#969;), optical dielectric constant &#949;&#8734;, Born effective charge Z*, electrical conductivity, as well as bond breaking behavior for a critical Se or Sb concentration, is evidenced. These findings provide a blueprint to experimentally explore the influence of metavalent bonding on attractive properties of phase&#8208;change materials and thermoelectrics. Particularly important is its impact on optical properties, which can be tailored by the amount of electrons shared between adjacent atoms. This correlation can be used to design optoelectronic materials and to explore systematic changes in chemical bonding with stoichiometry and atomic arrangement.

         <title>Photonic Bandgap in Achiral Liquid Crystals&#8212;A Twist on a Twist</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photonic bandgap phenomenon is observed in a liquid crystalline phase built of achiral molecules, in which a tendency to twist is caused by steric interactions between strongly bent molecules. A selective reflection of visible light appears due to unwinding of the helical structure at the transition between two smectic phases having a single&#8208; and double&#8208;helical structure.








Abstract
Achiral mesogenic molecules are shown to be able to spontaneously assemble into liquid crystalline smectic phases having either simple or double&#8208;helical structures. At the transition between these phases, the double&#8208;helical structure unwinds. As a consequence, in some temperature range, the pitch of the helix becomes comparable to the wavelength of visible light and the selective reflection of light in the visible range is observed. The photonic bandgap phenomenon is reported for achiral liquid crystals.

         <title>A Sustainable and Flexible Microbrush&#8208;Faced Triboelectric Generator for Portable/Wearable Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microbrush&#8208;faced triboelectric nanogenerator featuring high robustness, outstanding sustainability, and excellent durability displays remarkable capability for mechanical energy harvesting in separate working modes. Human&#8208;being&#8208;interactive triboelectrification with this device reveals outstanding power generation and durability, suggesting that it can serve as a power source for various types of handheld electronics.








Abstract
Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) are put forward as a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art energy&#8208;scavenging technology for self&#8208;powered electronics, but their severe wear and degradation driven by inevitable friction can pose significant durability and sustainability concerns. Here, an array of microfibers is reported that functions as a robust and sustainable TENG in both in&#8208;plane sliding and vertical contact&#8208;separation modes, with excellent electrical potential as high as 20&#160;V and a high cyclability of 3000. The design flexibility of this microbrush TENG (MB&#8208;TENG) on the counter materials facilitates the further improvement of electrical outputs, benefiting numerous applications of human&#8208;interactive triboelectrification. Significantly, these MB&#8208;TENGs offer sufficient output power for successfully driving a smartwatch as well as an electromyography module. This technology uses a simple and cost&#8208;effective manner to provide a robust and reliable monolithic TENG module, which is expected to serve as a promising energy&#8208;harvesting source for self&#8208;powered electronics in the near future.

         <title>Laser&#8208;Induced Cooperative Transition in Molecular Electronic Crystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A major challenge in a supramolecular electronic crystal is switchable control of its hidden phase. The cooperative tuning of K&#8208;TCNQ through a pulsed electromagnetic field into an emergent electronic disorder state, enabling access to a long&#8208;lived (over 400 days) hidden conducting phase, is found. A switchable magneto&#8208;electronic bistability is realized in a broad temperature range from 2 to 360 K.








Abstract
The competing and non&#8208;equilibrium phase transitions, involving dynamic tunability of cooperative electronic and magnetic states in strongly correlated materials, show great promise in quantum sensing and information technology. To date, the stabilization of transient states is still in the preliminary stage, particularly with respect to molecular electronic solids. Here, a dynamic and cooperative phase in potassium&#8208;7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane (K&#8208;TCNQ) with the control of pulsed electromagnetic excitation is demonstrated. Simultaneous dynamic and coherent lattice perturbation with 8 ns&#160;pulsed laser (532&#160;nm, 15 MW&#160;cm&#8722;2, 10 Hz)&#160;in such a molecular electronic crystal initiates a stable long&#8208;lived (over 400 days) conducting paramagnetic state (&#8776;42 &#937;cm), showing the charge&#8211;spin bistability over a broad temperature range from 2 to 360 K. Comprehensive noise spectroscopy, in situ high&#8208;pressure measurements, electron spin resonance (ESR), theoretical model, and scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) studies provide further evidence that such a transition is cooperative, requiring a dedicated charge&#8211;spin&#8211;lattice decoupling to activate and subsequently stabilize nonequilibrium phase. The cooperativity triggered by ultrahigh&#8208;strain&#8208;rate (above 106 s&#8722;1) pulsed excitation offers a collective control toward the generation and stabilization of strongly correlated electronic and magnetic orders in molecular electronic solids and offers unique electro&#8208;magnetic phases with technological promises.

         <title>Daratumumab Immunopolymersome&#8208;Enabled Safe and CD38&#8208;Targeted Chemotherapy and Depletion of Multiple Myeloma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Immuno&#8208;nanomedicines are emerging targeted cancer therapeutics that might reshape the clinical treatment scheme. Novel fabrication of small and smart daratumumab immunopolymersomes is presented carrying vincristine sulfate that induce extraordinary potency and selectivity while mitigating systemic toxicity toward orthotopic multiple myeloma in vivo.








Abstract
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a second ranking hematological malignancy. Despite the fast advancement of new treatments such as bortezormib and daratumumab, MM patients remain incurable and tend to eventually become relapsed and drug&#8208;resistant. Development of novel therapies capable of depleting MM cells is strongly needed. Here, daratumumab immunopolymersomes carrying vincristine sulfate (Dar&#8208;IPs&#8208;VCR) are reported for safe and high&#8208;efficacy CD38&#8208;targeted chemotherapy and depletion of orthotopic MM in vivo. Dar&#8208;IPs&#8208;VCR made by postmodification via strain&#8208;promoted click reaction holds tailored antibody density (2.2, 4.4 to 8.7 Dar per IPs), superb stability, small size (43&#8211;49&#160;nm), efficacious VCR loading, and glutathione&#8208;responsive VCR release. Dar4.4&#8208;IPs&#8208;VCR induces exceptional anti&#8208;MM activity with an IC50 of 76 &#215; 10&#8722;12 m to CD38&#8208;positive LP&#8208;1&#160;MM cells, 12&#8208; and 20&#8208;fold enhancement over nontargeted Ps&#8208;VCR and free VCR controls, respectively. Intriguingly, mice bearing orthotopic LP&#8208;1&#8208;Luc MM following four cycles of i.v. administration of Dar4.4&#8208;IPs&#8208;VCR at 0.25&#160;mg VCR equiv. kg&#8722;1 reveal complete depletion of LP&#8208;1&#8208;Luc cells, superior survival rate to all controls, and no body weight loss. The bone and histological analyses indicate bare bone and organ damage. Dar&#8208;IPs&#8208;VCR appears as a safe and targeted treatment for CD38&#8208;overexpressed hematological malignancies.

         <title>Improving the Stability of Non&#8208;Noble&#8208;Metal M&#8211;N&#8211;C Catalysts for Proton&#8208;Exchange&#8208;Membrane Fuel Cells through M&#8211;N Bond Length and Coordination Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective and universal strategy is developed to improve the stability of M&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts in half&#8208;cell and H2&#8211;O2/air fuel cells by accurately regulating the M&#63743;N bond length/coordination. Interestingly, the Fe&#63743;N bond length/coordination of the catalysts are strongly dependent on the binding constant of Fe3+ and polymer in the precursors, which can be linked with their performance degradation in fuel cells.








Abstract
An effective and universal strategy is developed to enhance the stability of the non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal M&#8211;Nx/C catalyst in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) by improving the bonding strength between metal ions and chelating polymers, i.e., poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) homopolymer and poly(acrylic acid&#8211;maleic acid) (P(AA&#8208;MA)) copolymer with different AA/MA ratios. M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) reveal that the optimal P(AA&#8208;MA)&#8211;Fe&#8211;N catalyst with a higher Fe3+&#8211;polymer binding constant possesses longer Fe&#63743;N bonds and exclusive Fe&#8211;N4/C moiety compared to PAA&#8211;Fe&#8211;N, which consists of &#8776;15% low&#8208;coordinated Fe&#8211;N2/N3 structures. The optimized P(AA&#8208;MA)&#8211;Fe&#8211;N catalyst exhibits outstanding ORR activity and stability in both half&#8208;cell and PEMFC cathodes, with the retention rate of current density approaching 100% for the first 37 h at 0.55&#160;V in an H2&#8211;air fuel cell. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the Fe&#8211;N4/C site could optimize the difference between the adsorption energy of the Fe atoms on the support (Ead) and the bulk cohesive energy (Ecoh) relative to Fe&#8211;N2/N3 moieties, thereby strongly stabilizing Fe centers against demetalation.

         <title>Al&#8211;Ge&#8211;Al Nanowire Heterostructure: From Single&#8208;Hole Quantum Dot to Josephson Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly tunable superconducting&#8211;semiconducting hybrid junction based on intrinsic germanium (i&#8208;Ge) nanowires is revealed. Low&#8208;temperature transport measurements of ultrascaled monolithic Al&#8211;Ge&#8211;Al nanowire heterostructures featuring monocrystalline Al leads and abrupt Al&#8211;Ge interfaces demonstrate that such i&#8208;Ge quantum dot devices can be tuned to access three distinct regimes: single&#8208;hole&#8208;filling quantum dots, an intermediate sub&#8208;gap states regime, and a superconducting regime.








Abstract
Superconductor&#8211;semiconductor&#8211;superconductor heterostructures are attractive for both fundamental studies of quantum phenomena in low&#8208;dimensional hybrid systems as well as for future high&#8208;performance low power dissipating nanoelectronic and quantum devices. In this work, ultrascaled monolithic Al&#8211;Ge&#8211;Al nanowire heterostructures featuring monocrystalline Al leads and abrupt metal&#8211;semiconductor interfaces are used to probe the low&#8208;temperature transport in intrinsic Ge (i&#8208;Ge) quantum dots. In particular, demonstrating the ability to tune the Ge quantum dot device from completely insulating, through a single&#8208;hole&#8208;filling quantum dot regime, to a supercurrent regime, resembling a Josephson field effect transistor with a maximum critical current of 10 nA at a temperature of 390 mK. The realization of a Josephson field&#8208;effect transistor with high junction transparency provides a mechanism to study sub&#8208;gap transport mediated by Andreev states. The presented results reveal a promising intrinsic Ge&#8208;based architecture for hybrid superconductor&#8211;semiconductor devices for the study of Majorana zero modes and key components of quantum computing such as gatemons or gate tunable superconducting quantum interference devices.

         <title>Anisotropic Iridescence and Polarization Patterns in a Direct Ink Written Chiral Photonic Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by natural examples of patterned iridescence, an ink based on a chiral nematic liquid crystal that can be processed with a direct ink writer 3D printer is shown. Tuning the writing direction and speed leads to the programmed formation of a slanted photonic axis that exhibits atypical iridescence and polarization selectivity.








Abstract
The iridescence of structural color and its polarization characteristics originate from the nanoscale organization of materials. A major challenge in materials science is generating the bright, lustrous hues seen in nature through nanoscale engineering, while simultaneously controlling interaction of the material with different light polarizations. In this work, a suitable chiral nematic liquid crystal elastomer ink is synthesized for direct ink writing, which self&#8208;assembles into a chiral photonic structure. Tuning the writing direction and speed leads to the programmed formation of a slanted photonic axis, which exhibits atypical iridescence and polarization selectivity. After crosslinking, a freely programmable, chiroptical photonic polymer material is obtained. The strongly perspective&#8208;dependent appearance of the material can function as specialized anticounterfeit markers, as optical elements in decorative iridescent coatings, or, as demonstrated here, in optically based signaling features.

         <title>Dynamic Symmetry Breaking in Chiral Magnetic Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel domain growth behaviors are observed with respect to in&#8208;plane magnetic fields in [Co/Ni/Pt] multilayers with chiral N&#233;el&#8208;type domain walls (DWs), including growth perpendicular to the in&#8208;plane field axis. Accounting for steady&#8208;state DW dynamics, the reported model successfully predicts the magnetization and energetic profiles that promote these asymmetries. These results expand the utility of DW motion in probing chiral magnetism.








Abstract
The Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction (DMI) in magnetic systems stabilizes spin textures with preferred chirality, applicable to next&#8208;generation memory and computing architectures. In perpendicularly magnetized heavy&#8208;metal/ferromagnet films, the interfacial DMI originating from structural inversion asymmetry and strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling favors chiral N&#233;el&#8208;type domain walls (DWs) whose energetics and mobility remain at issue. Here, a new effect is characterized in which domains expand unidirectionally in response to a combination of out&#8208;of&#8208;plane and in&#8208;plane magnetic fields, with the growth direction controlled by the in&#8208;plane field strength. These growth directionalities and symmetries with applied fields cannot be understood from static treatments alone. The authors theoretically demonstrate that perpendicular field torques stabilize steady&#8208;state magnetization profiles highly asymmetric in elastic energy, resulting in a dynamic symmetry breaking consistent with the experimental findings. This phenomenon sheds light on the mechanisms governing the dynamics of N&#233;el&#8208;type DWs and expands the utility of field&#8208;driven DW motion to probe and control chiral DWs.

&lt;p&gt;Novel domain growth behaviors are observed with respect to in-plane magnetic fields in [Co/Ni/Pt] multilayers with chiral N&#233;el-type domain walls (DWs), including growth perpendicular to the in-plane field axis. Accounting for steady-state DW dynamics, the reported model successfully predicts the magnetization and energetic profiles that promote these asymmetries. These results expand the utility of DW motion in probing chiral magnetism.

         <title>Reduced Intrinsic Non&#8208;Radiative Losses Allow Room&#8208;Temperature Triplet Emission from Purely Organic Emitters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The substitution of a hydrogen atom with an N&#8208;phenyl ring is demonstrated to convert an organic material without phosphorescence emission into a molecular system exhibiting efficient and ultralong afterglow phosphorescence at room temperature, originating from a reduction of intrinsic non&#8208;radiative molecular relaxations, which can be used for data safety applications.








Abstract
Persistent luminescence from triplet excitons in organic molecules is rare, as fast non&#8208;radiative deactivation typically dominates over radiative transitions. This work demonstrates that the substitution of a hydrogen atom in a derivative of phenanthroimidazole with an N&#8208;phenyl ring can substantially stabilize the excited state. This stabilization converts an organic material without phosphorescence emission into a molecular system exhibiting efficient and ultralong afterglow phosphorescence at room temperature. Results from systematic photophysical investigations, kinetic modeling, excited&#8208;state dynamic modeling, and single&#8208;crystal structure analysis identify that the long&#8208;lived triplets originate from a reduction of intrinsic non&#8208;radiative molecular relaxations. Further modification of the N&#8208;phenyl ring with halogen atoms affects the afterglow lifetime and quantum yield. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, an anticounterfeiting device is demonstrated with a time&#8208;dependent Morse code feature for data encryption based on these emitters. A fundamental design principle is outlined to achieve long&#8208;lived and emissive triplet states by suppressing intrinsic non&#8208;radiative relaxations in the form of molecular vibrations or rotations.

         <title>54 cm2 Large&#8208;Area Flexible Organic Solar Modules with Efficiency Above 13%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient large&#8208;area flexible solar cells and modules are demonstrated based on a printable, transparent, low&#8208;surface&#8208;roughness, flexible electrode (silver nanowires:zinc&#8208;chelated polyethylenimine). A power conversion efficiency of 13.2% is obtained for a 54 cm2 solar module. The flexible electrode is also demonstrated in high&#8208;performance flexible quantum&#8208;dot light&#8208;emitting diodes.








Abstract
Development of large&#8208;area flexible organic solar cells (OSCs) is highly desirable for their practical applications. However, the efficiency of the large&#8208;area flexible OSCs severely lags behind small&#8208;area devices. Here, efficient large&#8208;area flexible single cells with power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.1% and 12.6% for areas of 6 and 10 cm2, and flexible modules with a PCE of 13.2% (54 cm2) based on poly(ethylene terephthalate)/Ag grid/silver nanowires (AgNWs):zinc&#8208;chelated polyethylenimine (PEI&#8208;Zn) composite electrodes are reported. The solution&#8208;processed flexible transparent electrode of AgNWs:PEI&#8208;Zn shows low surface roughness and good optoelectronic and mechanical properties. PEI&#8208;Zn is conductive and optically transparent. It can adhere to and wrap the AgNWs under electrostatic interaction between the negatively charged surface (AgNWs) and positively charged protonated amine groups (in PEI&#8208;Zn). It wraps the AgNWs networks and fills the void space to achieve a smooth surface. The flexible electrode is validated in both flexible OSCs and flexible quantum&#8208;dots light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs). Small&#8208;area flexible OSCs show a PCE of 16.1%, and flexible QLEDs show an external quantum efficiency of 13.3%. In the end, a flexible module is demonstrated to charge a mobile phone as a flexible power source (shown in Video S1, Supporting Information).

         <title>A Bioresorbable Dynamic Pressure Sensor for Cardiovascular Postoperative Care</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioresorbable electronics that can be absorbed and become part of the organism after their service life are a new trend to avoid secondary invasive surgery. A flexible bioresorbable triboelectric pressure sensor is demonstrated based on the triboelectric effect. It can overcome the material limitations caused by the working principle. This device is expected to be applied in postoperative care.








Abstract
Bioresorbable electronics that can be absorbed and become part of the organism after their service life are a new trend to avoid secondary invasive surgery. However, the material limitation is a significant challenge. There are fewer biodegradable materials with pressure&#8208;sensitive properties. Here, a pressure sensor based on the triboelectric effect between bioabsorbable materials is reported. This effect is available in almost all materials. The bioresorbable triboelectric sensor (BTS) can directly convert ambient pressure changes into electrical signals. This device successfully identifies abnormal vascular occlusion events in large animals (dogs). The service life of the BTS reaches 5 days with a high service efficiency (5.95%). The BTS offers excellent sensitivity (11 mV&#160;mmHg&#8722;1), linearity (R2&#160;= 0.993), and good durability (450&#160;000 cycles). The antibacterial bioresorbable materials (poly(lactic acid)&#8211;(chitosan 4%)) for the BTS can achieve 99% sterilization. Triboelectric devices are expected to be applied in postoperative care as bioresorbable electronics.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Halide Perovskite Field&#8208;Effect Transistors by Ion Transport Mitigation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Realization of solution&#8208;processed halide perovskites transistors is challenging due to the presence of mobile ions. A generic strategy is demonstrated that can be applied for regulating ions in mixed ionic&#8211;electronic semiconductors and that enables the demonstration of perovskite transistors working at room&#8208;temperature by fixation of the mobile ions through ferroelectric polarization. 








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed halide perovskites have emerged as excellent optoelectronic materials for applications in photovoltaic solar cells and light&#8208;emitting diodes. However, the presence of mobile ions in the material hinders the development of perovskite field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) due to screening of the gate potential in the nearby perovskite channel, and the resulting impediment to achieving gate modulation of an electronic current at room temperature. Here, room&#8208;temperature operation is demonstrated in cesium lead tribromide (CsPbBr3) perovskite&#8208;based FETs using an auxiliary ferroelectric gate of poly(vinylidenefluoride&#8208;co&#8208;trifluoroethylene) [P(VDF&#8208;TrFE)], to electrostatically fixate the mobile ions. The large interfacial polarization of the ferroelectric gate attracts the mobile ions away from the main nonferroelectric gate interface, thereby enabling modulation of the electronic current through the channel by the main gate. This strategy allows for realization of the p&#8208;type CsPbBr3 channel and revealing the thermally activated nature of the hole charge transport. The proposed strategy is generic and can be applied for regulating ions in a variety of ionic&#8211;electronic mixed semiconductors.

&lt;p&gt;Realization of solution-processed halide perovskites transistors is challenging due to the presence of mobile ions. A generic strategy is demonstrated that can be applied for regulating ions in mixed ionic&#8211;electronic semiconductors and that enables the demonstration of perovskite transistors working at room-temperature by fixation of the mobile ions through ferroelectric polarization. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solution-processed halide perovskites have emerged as excellent optoelectronic materials for applications in photovoltaic solar cells and light-emitting diodes. However, the presence of mobile ions in the material hinders the development of perovskite field-effect transistors (FETs) due to screening of the gate potential in the nearby perovskite channel, and the resulting impediment to achieving gate modulation of an electronic current at room temperature. Here, room-temperature operation is demonstrated in cesium lead tribromide (CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) perovskite-based FETs using an auxiliary ferroelectric gate of poly(vinylidenefluoride-&lt;i&gt;co&lt;/i&gt;-trifluoroethylene) [P(VDF-TrFE)], to electrostatically fixate the mobile ions. The large interfacial polarization of the ferroelectric gate attracts the mobile ions away from the main nonferroelectric gate interface, thereby enabling modulation of the electronic current through the channel by the main gate. This strategy allows for realization of the p-type CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; channel and revealing the thermally activated nature of the hole charge transport. The proposed strategy is generic and can be applied for regulating ions in a variety of ionic&#8211;electronic mixed semiconductors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Tandem Organic Photovoltaic Cell with 19.6% Efficiency Enabled by Light Distribution Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
By fine&#8208;tuning the optical field distribution and employing photovoltaic materials with low energy losses in tandem photovoltaic cell, a power conversion efficiency of 19.64% is achieved.








Abstract
Despite more potential in realizing higher photovoltaic performance, the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of tandem organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells still lags behind that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art single&#8208;junction cells. In this work, highly efficient double&#8208;junction tandem OPV cells are fabricated by optimizing the photoactive layers with low voltage losses and developing an effective method to tune optical field distribution. The tandem OPV cells studied are structured as indium tin oxide (ITO)/ZnO/bottom photoactive layer/interconnecting layer (ICL)/top photoactive layer/MoOx/Ag, where the bottom and top photoactive layers are based on blends of PBDB&#8208;TF:ITCC and PBDB&#8208;TF:BTP&#8208;eC11, respectively, and ICL refers to interconnecting layer structured as MoOx/Ag/ZnO:PFN&#8208;Br. As these results indicate that there is not much room for optimizing the bottom photoactive layer, more effort is put into fine&#8208;tuning the top photoactive layer. By rationally modulating the composition and thickness of PBDB&#8208;TF:BTP&#8208;eC11 blend films, the 300 nm&#8208;thick PBDB&#8208;TF:BTP&#8208;eC11 film with 1:2 D/A ratio is found to be an ideal photoactive layer for the top sub&#8208;cell in terms of photovoltaic characteristics and light distribution control. For the optimized tandem cell, a PCE of 19.64% is realized, which is the highest result in the OPV field and certified as 19.50% by the National Institute of Metrology.

         <title>Magnetization Signature of Topological Surface States in a Non&#8208;Symmorphic Superconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly anomalous surface superconductivity is reported in a non&#8208;symmorphic superconductor, In2Bi, where the nontrivial band structure results in the existence of topologically protected surface states (TSS). The near&#8208;perfect screening of low&#8208;frequency magnetic fields well above the upper critical field is explained by proximity superconductivity of TSS. Detecting TSS via macroscopic magnetization provides a new tool for identification of topological superconductors.








Abstract
Superconductors with nontrivial band structure topology represent a class of materials with unconventional and potentially useful properties. Recent years have seen much success in creating artificial hybrid structures exhibiting the main characteristics of 2D topological superconductors. Yet, bulk materials known to combine inherent superconductivity with nontrivial topology remain scarce, largely because distinguishing their central characteristic&#8212;the topological surface states&#8212;has proved challenging due to a dominant contribution from the superconducting bulk. In this work, a highly anomalous behavior of surface superconductivity in topologically nontrivial 3D superconductor In2Bi, where the surface states result from its nontrivial band structure, itself a consequence of the non&#8208;symmorphic crystal symmetry and strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling, is reported. In contrast to smoothly decreasing diamagnetic susceptibility above the bulk critical field, Hc2, as seen in conventional superconductors, a near&#8208;perfect, Meissner&#8208;like screening of low&#8208;frequency magnetic fields well above Hc2 is observed. The enhanced diamagnetism disappears at a new phase transition close to the critical field of surface superconductivity, Hc3. Using theoretical modeling, the anomalous screening is shown to be consistent with modification of surface superconductivity by the topological surface states. The possibility of detecting signatures of the surface states using macroscopic magnetization provides a new tool for the discovery and identification of topological superconductors.

         <title>Homogeneous Carbon/Potassium&#8208;Incorporation Strategy for Synthesizing Red Polymeric Carbon Nitride Capable of Near&#8208;Infrared Photocatalytic H2 Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solid&#8208;salt&#8208;induced homogeneous incorporation strategy realizes red carbon/potassium&#8208;incorporated polymeric carbon nitride, which exhibits highly efficient H2 evolution from water and in situ hydrogen gas (drug&#8208;free) cancer therapy excited by near&#8208;infrared light.








Abstract
The efficient utilization of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light for photocatalytic hydrogen generation is vitally important to both solar hydrogen energy and hydrogen medicine, but remains a challenge at present, owing to the strict requirement of the semiconductor for high NIR responsiveness, narrow bandgap, and suitable redox potentials. Here, an NIR&#8208;active carbon/potassium&#8208;doped red polymeric carbon nitride (RPCN) is achieved for by using a similar&#8208;structure dopant as the melamine (C3H6N6) precursor with the solid KCl. The homogeneous and high incorporation of carbon and potassium remarkably narrows the bandgap of carbon nitride (1.7&#160;eV) and endows RPCN with a high NIR&#8208;photocatalytic activity for H2 evolution from water at the rate of 140 &#181;mol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 under NIR irradiation (700 nm &#8804; &#955;&#160;&#8804; 780&#160;nm), and the apparent quantum efficiency is high as 0.84% at 700 &#177; 10&#160;nm (and 13% at 500 &#177; 10&#160;nm). A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiment on a tumor&#8208;bearing mouse model verifies RPCN as being capable of intratumoral NIR&#8208;photocatalytic hydrogen generation and simultaneous glutathione deprivation for safe and high&#8208;efficacy drug&#8208;free cancer therapy. The results shed light on designing efficient photocatalysts to capture the full spectrum of solar energy, and also pioneer a new pathway to develop NIR photocatalysts for hydrogen therapy of major diseases.

         <title>Engineering Endogenous Tumor&#8208;Associated Macrophage&#8208;Targeted Biomimetic Nano&#8208;RBC to Reprogram Tumor Immunosuppressive Microenvironment for Enhanced Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>

         <dc:description>
An endogenous tumor&#8208;associated macrophage (TAM)&#8208;targeted biomimetic nano red blood cell (nano&#8208;RBC) system is engineered via self&#8208;assembly of a hemoglobin&#8211;poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone) (Hb&#8211;PCL) conjugate for enhanced cancer chemo&#8208;immunotherapy. The doxorubicin (DOX)&#8208;loaded nano&#8208;RBC (V(Hb)@DOX) can innately target to decrease the number of immunosuppressive TAMs. Moreover, the O2 released from nano&#8208;RBC relieves tumor hypoxia, which further reprograms the immunosuppressive state to stimulate antitumor responses. The synergistic chemo&#8208;immunotherapy effectively suppresses tumor growth, inhibits metastasis, and prevents autologous tumor recurrence.








Abstract
Immunotherapy has shown encouraging results in various cancers, but the response rates are relatively low due to the complex tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment (TIME). The presence of tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) and tumor hypoxia correlates significantly with potent immunosuppressive activity. Here, a hemoglobin&#8211;poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone) (Hb&#8211;PCL) conjugate self&#8208;assembled biomimetic nano red blood cell (nano&#8208;RBC) system (V(Hb)) is engineered to deliver chemotherapeutic doxorubicin (DOX) and oxygen for reprogramming TIME. The Hb moiety of V(Hb)@DOX can bind to endogenous plasma haptoglobin (Hp) and specifically target the M2&#8208;type TAMs via the CD163 surface receptor, and effectively kill the cells. In addition, the O2 released by the Hb alleviates tumor hypoxia, which further augments the antitumor immune response by recruiting fewer M2&#8208;type macrophages. TAM&#8208;targeting depletion and hypoxia alleviation synergistically reprogram the TIME, which concurrently downregulate PD&#8208;L1 expression of tumor cells, decrease the levels of immunosuppressive cytokines such as IL&#8208;10 and TGF&#8208;&#946;, elevate the immunostimulatory IFN&#8208;&#947;, enhance cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response, and boost a strong memory response. The ensuing TAM&#8208;targeted chemo&#8208;immunotherapeutic effects markedly inhibit tumor metastasis and recurrence. Taken together, the engineered endogenous TAM&#8208;targeted biomimetic nano&#8208;RBC system is a highly promising tool to reprogram TIME for cancer chemo&#8208;immunotherapy.

The doxorubicin (DOX)-loaded nano-RBC (V(Hb)@DOX) can innately target to decrease the number of immunosuppressive TAMs. Moreover, the O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; released from nano-RBC relieves tumor hypoxia, which further reprograms the immunosuppressive state to stimulate antitumor responses. The synergistic chemo-immunotherapy effectively suppresses tumor growth, inhibits metastasis, and prevents autologous tumor recurrence.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immunotherapy has shown encouraging results in various cancers, but the response rates are relatively low due to the complex tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment (TIME). The presence of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and tumor hypoxia correlates significantly with potent immunosuppressive activity. Here, a hemoglobin&#8211;poly(&#949;-caprolactone) (Hb&#8211;PCL) conjugate self-assembled biomimetic nano red blood cell (nano-RBC) system (V(Hb)) is engineered to deliver chemotherapeutic doxorubicin (DOX) and oxygen for reprogramming TIME. The Hb moiety of V(Hb)@DOX can bind to endogenous plasma haptoglobin (Hp) and specifically target the M2-type TAMs via the CD163 surface receptor, and effectively kill the cells. In addition, the O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; released by the Hb alleviates tumor hypoxia, which further augments the antitumor immune response by recruiting fewer M2-type macrophages. TAM-targeting depletion and hypoxia alleviation synergistically reprogram the TIME, which concurrently downregulate PD-L1 expression of tumor cells, decrease the levels of immunosuppressive cytokines such as IL-10 and TGF-&#946;, elevate the immunostimulatory IFN-&#947;, enhance cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response, and boost a strong memory response. The ensuing TAM-targeted chemo-immunotherapeutic effects markedly inhibit tumor metastasis and recurrence. Taken together, the engineered endogenous TAM-targeted biomimetic nano-RBC system is a highly promising tool to reprogram TIME for cancer chemo-immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Atomic Layers of Transition&#8208;Metal Carbides (MXenes)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;entropy atomic layers of transition&#8208;metal carbide (HE&#8208;MXene) are produced via selectively etching a high&#8208;entropy MAX phase, in which five transition&#8208;metal species are homogeneously dispersed into one MX slab, giving rise to stable transition&#8208;metal carbide in the atomic layers. The resultant HE&#8208;MXene has distinct lattice distortions and strains, efficiently guiding the nucleation and uniform growth of lithium.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy materials (HEMs) have great potential for energy storage and conversion due to their diverse compositions, and unexpected physical and chemical features. However, high&#8208;entropy atomic layers with fully exposed active sites are difficult to synthesize since their phases are easily segregated. Here, it is demonstrated that high&#8208;entropy atomic layers of transition&#8208;metal carbide (HE&#8208;MXene) can be produced via the selective etching of novel high&#8208;entropy MAX (also termed Mn+1AXn (n&#160;= 1, 2, 3), where M represents an early transition&#8208;metal element, A is an element mainly from groups 13&#8211;16, and X stands for C and/or N) phase (HE&#8208;MAX) (Ti1/5V1/5Zr1/5Nb1/5Ta1/5)2AlC, in which the five transition&#8208;metal species are homogeneously dispersed into one MX slab due to their solid&#8208;solution feature, giving rise to a stable transition&#8208;metal carbide in the atomic layers owing to the high molar configurational entropy and correspondingly low Gibbs free energy. Additionally, the resultant high&#8208;entropy MXene with distinct lattice distortions leads to high mechanical strain into the atomic layers. Moreover, the mechanical strain can efficiently guide the nucleation and uniform growth of dendrite&#8208;free lithium on HE&#8208;MXene, achieving a long cycling stability of up to 1200 h and good deep stripping&#8211;plating levels of up to 20 mAh cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Wavelength&#8208;Selective Softening of Hydrogel Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly selective photochemical behavior of three chromophores with distinct degradation wavelengths is exploited for the construction of selectively degradable hydrogels. Specifically, hydrogel softening can be achieved in a stepwise fashion according to the chromophores&#8217; activation wavelength, enabling fine control over the hydrogel's mechanical properties.








Abstract
Photoresponsive hydrogels hold key potential in advanced biomedical applications including tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, and drug delivery, as well as intricately engineered functions such as biosensing, soft robotics, and bioelectronics. Herein, the wavelength&#8208;dependent degradation of bio&#8208;orthogonal poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogels is reported, using three selective activation levels. Specifically, three chromophores are exploited, that is, ortho&#8208;nitrobenzene, dimethyl aminobenzene, and bimane, each absorbing light at different wavelengths. By examining their photochemical action plots, the wavelength&#8208;dependent reactivity of the photocleavable moieties is determined. The wavelength&#8208;selective addressability of individual photoreactive units is subsequently translated into hydrogel design, enabling wavelength&#8208;dependent cleavage of the hydrogel networks on&#8208;demand. Critically, this platform technology allows for the fabrication of various hydrogels, whose mechanical properties can be fine&#8208;tuned using different colors of light to reach a predefined value, according to the chromophore ratios used. The softening is shown to influence the spreading of pre&#8208;osteoblastic cells adhering to the gels as a demonstration of their potential utility. Furthermore, the materials and photodegradation processes are non&#8208;toxic to cells, making this platform attractive for biomaterials engineering.

Chiral Photonic Polymers
In article number 2103309, Albertus P. H. J. Schenning, Michael G. Debije, and co&#8208;workers show that using direct ink writing, unconventional chiral nematic objects can be generated, which show a bright iridescent color from normal incidence, or only from sharp angles of observation depending on the writing speed. The cover is a polarized optical microscopy image showing a detail from the free&#8208;standing Morpho&#8208;inspired print.

MXenes
In article number 2103393, Michael Naguib,  Michel W.

Cancer Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy
In article number 2103497, Yubin Huang, Dongfang Zhou, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate an engineered endogenous tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs)&#8208;targeting biomimetic nano&#8208;red&#8208;blood&#8208;cell (RBC) system to deliver chemotherapeutic doxorubicin and oxygen for enhanced cancer chemo&#8208;immunotherapy. TAMs&#8208;targeting depletion and hypoxia alleviation synergistically reprogram the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment. The ensuing TAMs&#8208;targeted chemo&#8208;immunotherapeutic effects markedly inhibit tumor metastasis and recurrence.

Supramolecular Electronic Crystals
The cooperative tuning of a supramolecular electronic crystal enables access to a long&#8208;lived hidden conducting phase with a broad temperature range from 2 to 360 K, through a pulsed electromagnetic field. In article number 2103000, Shenqiang Ren and co&#8208;workers demonstrate a a dynamic and cooperative phase in K&#8208;TCNQ, with the control of pulsed electromagnetic excitation. A dedicated charge&#8211;spin&#8211;lattice decoupling is required to activate and subsequently stabilize the non&#8208;equilibrium phase.

         <title>Advances in the Synthesis of 2D MXenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent progress of MXenes synthesis strategies, including etching, intercalation, and delamination, is summarized. The large&#8208;scale preparation methods for MXenes and their derivates, such as flexible membranes and fibers, are discussed. Moreover, the understanding of the oxidation stability of MXenes and stable storage strategies are also addressed.








Abstract
2D transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides, also known as MXenes, are versatile materials due to their adjustable structure and rich surface chemistry. The physical and chemical diversity has recognized MXenes as a potential 2D material with a wide spectrum of application domains. Since the discovery of MXenes in 2011, a wide variety of synthetic routes has been proposed with advancement toward large&#8208;scale preparing methods for MXene nanosheets and derivative products. Herein, the critical synthesis aspects and the operating conditions that influence the physical and chemical characteristics of MXenes are discussed in detail. The emerging etching methods including HF etching methods, in situ HF&#8208;forming etching methods, electrochemical etching methods, alkali etching methods, and molten salt etching methods, as well as delamination strategies are discussed. Considering the future developments and practical applications, the large&#8208;scale synthesis routes and the antioxidation strategies of MXenes are also summarized. In summary, a generalized overview of MXenes synthesis protocols with an outlook for the current challenges and promising technologies for large&#8208;scale preparation and stable storage is provided.

         <dc:description>
State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art micro/nanomaterials and schemes for multimodal reconfigurable micro/nanomachines, their dynamic assemblies, and swarming/collective behaviors are reviewed. Potential new materials and working principles are discussed along with their challenges and perspectives.








Abstract
Mechanically programmable, reconfigurable micro/nanoscale materials that can dynamically change their mechanical properties or behaviors, or morph into distinct assemblies or swarms in response to stimuli have greatly piqued the interest of the science community due to their unprecedented potentials in both fundamental research and technological applications. To date, a variety of designs of hard and soft materials, as well as actuation schemes based on mechanisms including chemical reactions and magnetic, acoustic, optical, and electric stimuli, have been reported. Herein, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art micro/nanostructures and operation schemes for multimodal reconfigurable micro/nanomachines and swarms, as well as potential new materials and working principles, challenges, and future perspectives are discussed.

         <title>Rational Design of Immunomodulatory Hydrogels for Chronic Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quality and duration of the healing process can be regulated via modulation of immune responses to tissue injury. Specifically, controlling pro&#8208;inflammatory phenotype&#8211;anti&#8208;inflammatory phenotype progression is a crucial step to ensure a conversion from the inflammatory to the healing stage. In this regard, immunomodulatory hydrogels with specific chemistry and surface properties can influence immune cell polarization and the chronic wound healing process.








Abstract
With all the advances in tissue engineering for construction of fully functional skin tissue, complete regeneration of chronic wounds is still challenging. Since immune reaction to the tissue damage is critical in regulating both the quality and duration of chronic wound healing cascade, strategies to modulate the immune system are of importance. Generally, in response to an injury, macrophages switch from pro&#8208;inflammatory to an anti&#8208;inflammatory phenotype. Therefore, controlling macrophages&#8217; polarization has become an appealing approach in regenerative medicine. Recently, hydrogels&#8208;based constructs, incorporated with various cellular and molecular signals, have been developed and utilized to adjust immune cell functions in various stages of wound healing. Here, the current state of knowledge on immune cell functions during skin tissue regeneration is first discussed. Recent advanced technologies used to design immunomodulatory hydrogels for controlling macrophages&#8217; polarization are then summarized. Rational design of hydrogels for providing controlled immune stimulation via hydrogel chemistry and surface modification, as well as incorporation of cell and molecules, are also dicussed. In addition, the effects of hydrogels&#8217; properties on immunogenic features and the wound healing process are summarized. Finally, future directions and upcoming research strategies to control immune responses during chronic wound healing are highlighted.
