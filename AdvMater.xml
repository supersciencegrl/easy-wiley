         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Annealing&#8208;Free Gold Printing via Anion&#8208;Assisted Photochemical Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile anion&#8208;assisted photochemical deposition&#8208;based gold patterning method, which can&#160;direct print highly conductive gold patterns (1.08 &#215; 107 S m&#8722;1) under ambient conditions without post annealing is presented. The technique combines Digital Light Processing&#8208;based projection lithography with specific ion effects. The high conductivity and excellent conformability of the printed Au is demonstrated, with reliable performance in electrophysiological signal transductions.








Abstract
Metal patterning via additive manufacturing has been phasing&#8208;in to broad applications in many medical, electronics, aerospace, and automotive industries. While previous efforts have produced various promising metal&#8208;patterning strategies, their complexity and high cost have limited their practical application in rapid production and prototyping. Herein, a one&#8208;step gold printing technique based on anion&#8208;assisted photochemical deposition (APD), which can directly print highly conductive gold patterns (1.08 &#215; 107 S m&#8722;1) under ambient conditions without post&#8208;annealing treatment, is introduced. Uniquely, the APD uses specific ion effects with projection lithography to pattern Au nanoparticles and simultaneously sinter them into tunable porous gold structures. The significant influence of kosmotropic or chaotropic anions in the precursor ink on tuning the morphologies and conductivities of the printed patterns by employing a series of different ions, including Cl&#8722; ions, in the printing process is presented. Additionally, the resistance stabilities and the electrochemical properties of the APD&#8208;printed gold patterns are carefully investigated. The high conductivity and excellent conformability of the printed Au electrodes are demonstrated with reliable performance in electrophysiological signal delivery and acquisition for biomedical applications. This work exploits the potential of photochemical&#8208;deposition&#8208;based metal patterning in flexible electronic manufacturing.

         <title>Accessing Excitation&#8208; and Time&#8208;Responsive Afterglows from Aqueous Processable Amorphous Polymer Films through Doping and Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Smart luminescent materials with tunable multicolor afterglows in response to excitation and delay time can be facilely constructed with aqueous processable polymers through physical doping. The afterglow colors can further be finely modulated by the variation of the doping concentration, co&#8208;doping, and the triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet F&#246;rster resonance energy&#8208;transfer process.








Abstract
Smart afterglow materials in response to excitation and delay time, including crystals, polymeric films, and carbon dots, have attracted considerable attention on account of their fundamental value in photophysics and promising applications in optoelectronics. However, the fabrication of amorphous and flexible polymer films with fine control remains underexplored. Herein, new doped polymer films based on sodium alginate and aromatic carboxylates are developed, which demonstrate following advantages: (i) easy and fast fabrication through the aqueous solution process, (ii) flexible, transparent, and re&#8208;dissolvable characteristics, (iii) multi&#8208;tunable afterglow colors from blue to red and even white with fine control. Specifically, even better controllability can be achieved through co&#8208;doping and triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (TS&#8208;FRET). Multimode advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting of these materials is demonstrated using their excitation&#8208; and time&#8208;dependent as well as TS&#8208;FRET&#8208;mediated afterglow colors.

         <title>Nonhalogenated Dual&#8208;Slot&#8208;Die Processing Enables High&#8208;Efficiency Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and effective strategy of dual&#8208;slot&#8208;die sequential processing (DSDS)&#160;is developed. Highly efficient nonhalogenated organic solar cells are fabricated by slot&#8208;die coating by the DSDS strategy without additives and complex post&#8208;treatments.








Abstract
Organic solar cells (OSCs) are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation photovoltaic technologies, with their power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) reaching 19%. However, the typically used spin&#8208;coating method, toxic halogenated processing solvents, and the conventional bulk&#8208;heterojunction (BHJ), which causes excessive charge recombination, hamper the commercialization and further efficiency promotion of OSCs. Here, a simple but effective dual&#8208;slot&#8208;die sequential processing (DSDS) strategy is proposed to address the above issues by achieving a continuous solution supply, avoiding the solubility limit of the nonhalogen solvents, and creating a graded&#8208;BHJ morphology. As a result, an excellent PCE of 17.07% is obtained with the device processed with o&#8208;xylene in an open&#8208;air environment with no post&#8208;treatment required, while a PCE of over 14% is preserved in a wide range of active&#8208;layer thickness. The unique film&#8208;formation mechanism is further identified during the DSDS processing, which suggests the formation of the graded&#8208;BHJ morphology by the mutual diffusion between the donor and acceptor and the subsequent progressive aggregation. The graded&#8208;BHJ structure leads to improved charge transport, inhibited charge recombination, and thus an excellent PCE. Therefore, the newly developed DSDS approach can effectively contribute to the realm of high&#8208;efficiency and eco&#8208;friendly OSCs, which can also possibly be generalized to other organic photoelectric devices.

         <title>Engineering Grain Boundaries in Two&#8208;dimensional Electronic Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Engineering the boundary structures in two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials provides an unprecedented opportunity to program the physical properties of the materials with extensive tunability and realize innovative devices with advanced functionalities. However, structural engineering technology is still in its infancy, and creating artificial boundary structures with high reproducibility remains difficult. In this review, we discuss about various emergent properties of 2D materials with different grain boundaries, and the current techniques to control the structures. We also discuss the remaining challenges for scalable and reproducible structure control and our outlook on the future directions of the related techniques.

         <title>High&#8208;efficiency Magnon&#8208;mediated Magnetization Switching in All&#8208;oxide Heterostructures with Perpendicular Magnetic Anisotropy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The search for efficient approaches to realize local switching of magnetic moments in spintronic devices has attracted extensive attention. One of the most promising approaches is the electrical manipulation of magnetization through electron&#8208;mediated spin torque. However, the Joule heat generated via electron motion unavoidably causes substantial energy dissipation and potential damage to spintronic devices. Here, all&#8208;oxide heterostructures of SrRuO3/NiO/SrIrO3 were&#160; epitaxially grown on SrTiO3 single&#8208;crystal substrates following the order of the ferromagnetic transition metal oxide SrRuO3 with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, insulating and antiferromagnetic NiO, and metallic transition metal oxide SrIrO3 with strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling. We&#160; demonstrate that instead of the electron spin torques, the magnon torques present in the antiferromagnetic NiO layer could&#160; directly manipulate the perpendicular magnetization of the ferromagnetic layer. This magnon mechanism may significantly reduce the electron motion&#8211;related energy dissipation from electron&#8208;mediated spin currents. Interestingly, the threshold current density to generate a sufficient magnon current to manipulate the magnetization was&#160; one order of magnitude smaller than that in conventional metallic systems. These findings suggest a route for developing highly efficient all&#8208;oxide spintronic devices operated by magnon current.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Iron Anchored Tubular g&#8208;C3N4 Catalysts for Ultrafast Fenton&#8208;Like Reaction: Roles of High&#8208;Valency Iron&#8208;Oxo Species and Organic Radicals</title>

         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersing Fe(III) sites into fine&#8208;tuned nitrogen&#8208;rich graphitic carbon nitride nanotubes are designed for peracetic acid activation and further for Fenton&#8208;like reactions. This work opens a new avenue to develop heterogenous catalytic systems with higher reactivity and better durability using a double engine mechanism.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts have emerged as an efficient oxidant activator for eliminating organic pollutants in Fenton&#8208;like systems. However, the complex preparation, single active site, lack of understanding of the fundamental mechanism, and harsh pH conditions currently limit their practical applications. In this work, single&#8208;atom iron anchored nitrogen&#8208;rich g&#8208;C3N4 nanotubes (FeCNs) are designed and synthesized by a facile approach, and eco&#8208;friendly peracetic acid (PAA) is selected as the oxidant for Fenton&#8208;like reactions. The constructed heterogenous system achieves an enhanced degradation of various organic contaminants over a wide pH range of 3.0&#8211;9.0, exhibiting an ultrahigh and stable catalytic activity, outperforming equivalent quantities of pristine g&#8208;C3N4 by 75 times. The 18O isotope&#8208;labeling technique, probe method, and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the efficient catalytic activity relies on the high&#8208;valency iron&#8208;oxo species coupled with organic radicals generated by PAA. An increase in electron transport from the contaminant to the formed &#8220;metastable PAA/FeCN catalyst surface complex&#8221; is detected. A double driving mechanism for the tubular g&#8208;C3N4 regulated by a single Fe site and PAA activation is proposed. This work opens an avenue for developing novel catalysts with the coexistence of multiple active units and providing opportunities for significantly improving catalytic efficiency.

         <title>Graphene&#8208;Based Intrinsically Stretchable 2D&#8208;Contact Electrodes for Highly Efficient Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A protocol to fabricate highly efficient organic light&#8208;emitting diodes that use an intrinsically stretchable 2D&#8208;contact electrode topped with graphene is reported. As a benefit of the fast carrier mobility with complete 2D contact with the organic material and the tunable work function of the 2D&#8208;contact stretchable electro (TCSE), the limited charge injection of the widely used silver&#8208;nanowire&#8208;based stretchable electrode is solved.








Abstract
Intrinsically stretchable organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (ISOLEDs) are becoming essential components of wearable electronics. However, the efficiencies of ISOLEDs have been highly inferior compared with their rigid counterparts, which is due to the lack of ideal stretchable electrode materials that can overcome the poor charge injection at 1D metallic nanowire/organic interfaces. Herein, highly efficient ISOLEDs that use graphene&#8208;based 2D&#8208;contact stretchable electrodes (TCSEs) that incorporate a graphene layer on top of embedded metallic nanowires are demonstrated. The graphene layer modifies the work function, promotes charge spreading, and impedes inward diffusion of oxygen and moisture. The work function (WF) of 3.57&#160;eV is achieved by forming a strong interfacial dipole after deposition of a newly designed conjugated polyelectrolyte with crown ether and anionic sulfonate groups on TCSE; this is the lowest value ever reported among ISOLEDs, which overcomes the existing problem of very poor electron injection in ISOLEDs. Subsequent pressure&#8208;controlled lamination yields a highly efficient fluorescent ISOLED with an unprecedently high current efficiency of 20.3&#160;cd A&#8722;1, which even exceeds that of an otherwise&#8208;identical rigid counterpart. Lastly, a 3 inch five&#8208;by&#8208;five passive matrix ISOLED is demonstrated using convex stretching. This work can provide a rational protocol for designing intrinsically stretchable high&#8208;efficiency optoelectronic devices with favorable interfacial electronic structures.

         <title>Sugar&#8208;Derived Isotropic Nanoscale Polycrystalline Graphite Capable of Considerable Plastic Deformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sugar&#8208;derived isotropic nanoscale polycrystalline graphite (SINPG) is prepared from colloidal organization of nanocapsules to nanograins by gel&#8208;casting in a non&#8208;pressure environment. SINPG exhibits ultrahigh strength, unprecedent plasticity, and excellent deformation, acting as a metallic material in compression tests. The cleavage associated with typical van der Waals materials is avoided with SINPG.








Abstract
Obtaining large plastic deformation in polycrystalline van der Waals (vdW) materials is challenging. Achieving such deformation is especially difficult in graphite because it is highly anisotropic. The development of sugar&#8208;derived isotropic nanostructured polycrystalline graphite (SINPG) is discussed herein. The structure of this material preserves the high in&#8208;plane rigidity and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane flexibility of graphene layers and enables prominent plasticity by activating the rotation of nanoscale (5&#8211;10&#160;nm) grains. Thus, micrometer&#8208;sized SINPG samples demonstrate enhanced compressive strengths of up to 3.0&#160;GPa and plastic strains of 30&#8211;50%. These findings suggest a new pathway for enabling plastic deformation in otherwise brittle vdW materials. This new class of nanostructured carbon materials is suitable for use in a broad range of fields, from semiconductor to aerospace applications.

         <title>A Skin&#8208;Inspired Design Integrating Mechano&#8211;Chemical&#8211;Thermal Robustness into Superhydrophobic Coatings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A skin&#8208;inspired triple&#8208;layered coating (STC) concept is proposed. The STC solves the contradiction between the superhydrophobicity and other functionalities (such as abrasion resistance, adhesion, and flame retardancy). Based on a step&#8208;by&#8208;step spraying process and feasible control of the components of each layer, continuous interfaces within layers are achieved, endowing the integration of excellent overall performances into one coating.








Abstract
Designing scalable coatings with a wide spectrum of functions such as liquid repellency, anticorrosion, and antiflaming and a high level of mechano&#8211;chemical&#8211;thermal robustness is crucial in real&#8208;life applications. However, these individual functionalities and robustness are coupled together or even have conflicting requirements on the interfacial or bulky properties of materials, and&#160;thus,&#160;simultaneously integrating all these individual features into one coating has proved challenging. Herein, an integral skin&#8208;inspired triple&#8208;layered coating (STC) that resolves conflicting demands imposed by individual features on the structural, chemical, mechanical, and thermal properties of materials is proposed. Specifically, the rational design of multiple gradients in roughness, wetting, strength, and flame retardancy and the formation of continuous interfaces along its triple layers endow a sustained liquid repellency, anticorrosion, and flame retardancy even under harsh environments, as well as strong antiabrasion on surfaces and adhesion with the substrate. Such an all&#8208;in&#8208;one design enhances the durability and lifetime of coatings and reduces the maintenance and repair, thereby contributing to cost and energy saving. Together with a facile spraying fabrication process, this STC provides a feasible and sustainable strategy for constructing energy and resource&#8208;saving materials.

         <dc:description>
Quantum conductance effects in memristive devices are reviewed, from fundamentals of electrochemical phenomena underlying memristive functionalities to ballistic electronic conduction transport in atomic&#8208;sized conductive filaments. Related challenges in nanoscale metrology for the characterization of memristive phenomena at the nanoscale are analyzed together with opportunities and envisioned applications for memristive devices working in the quantum regime.








Abstract
Quantum effects in novel functional materials and new device concepts represent a potential breakthrough for the development of new information processing technologies based on quantum phenomena. Among the emerging technologies, memristive elements that exhibit resistive switching, which relies on the electrochemical formation/rupture of conductive nanofilaments, exhibit quantum conductance effects at room temperature. Despite the underlying resistive switching mechanism having been exploited for the realization of next&#8208;generation memories and neuromorphic computing architectures, the potentialities of quantum effects in memristive devices are still rather unexplored. Here, a comprehensive review on memristive quantum devices, where quantum conductance effects can be observed by coupling ionics with electronics, is presented. Fundamental electrochemical and physicochemical phenomena underlying device functionalities are introduced, together with fundamentals of electronic ballistic conduction transport in nanofilaments. Quantum conductance effects including quantum mode splitting, stability, and random telegraph noise are analyzed, reporting experimental techniques and challenges of nanoscale metrology for the characterization of memristive phenomena. Finally, potential applications and future perspectives are envisioned, discussing how memristive devices with controllable atomic&#8208;sized conductive filaments can represent not only suitable platforms for the investigation of quantum phenomena but also promising building blocks for the realization of integrated quantum systems working in air at room temperature.

         <title>Programming Cellular Alignment in Engineered Cardiac Tissue via Bioprinting Anisotropic Organ Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aligned cardiac tissues are produced by 3D bioprinting a densely cellular ink composed of anisotropic organ building blocks (aOBBs). The aOBBs undergo shear&#8208;induced alignment along the print path when extruded through a tapered nozzle. This method enables programmable control over cardiac tissue alignment across multiple scales.








Abstract
The ability to replicate the 3D myocardial architecture found in human hearts is a grand challenge. Here, the fabrication of aligned cardiac tissues via bioprinting anisotropic organ building blocks (aOBBs) composed of human induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC&#8208;CMs) is reported. A bioink composed of contractile cardiac aOBBs is first generated and aligned cardiac tissue sheets with linear, spiral, and chevron features are printed. Next, aligned cardiac macrofilaments are printed, whose contractile force and conduction velocity increase over time and exceed the performance of spheroid&#8208;based cardiac tissues. Finally, the ability to spatially control the magnitude and direction of contractile force by printing cardiac sheets with different aOBB alignment is highlighted. This research opens new avenues to generating functional cardiac tissue with high cell density and complex cellular alignment.

         <title>Obstructed Surface States as the Descriptor for Predicting Catalytic Active Sites in Inorganic Crystalline Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsic obstructed surfaces states can be a descriptor for the fast and precise identification of catalytic active sites. High&#8208;performance catalysts can be predicted by simply counting the density of obstructed Wannier charge centers under the framework of classic d band theory.








Abstract
The discovery of new catalysts that are efficient and sustainable is a major research endeavor for many industrial chemical processes. This requires an understanding and determination of the catalytic origins, which remains a challenge. Here, a novel method to identify the position of active sites based on searching for crystalline symmetry&#8208;protected obstructed atomic insulators (OAIs) that have metallic surface states is described. The obstructed Wannier charge centers (OWCCs) in OAIs are pinned by symmetries at some empty Wyckoff positions so that surfaces that accommodate these sites are guaranteed to have metallic obstructed surface states (OSSs). It is proposed and confirmed that the OSSs are the catalytic activity origins for crystalline materials. The theory on 2H&#8208;MoTe2, 1T&#8242;&#8208;MoTe2, and NiPS3 bulk single crystals is verified, whose active sites are consistent with the calculations. Most importantly, several high&#8208;efficiency catalysts are successfully identified just by considering the number of OWCCs and the symmetry. Using the real&#8208;space&#8208;invariant theory applied to a database of 34 013 topologically trivial insulators, 1788 unique OAIs are identified, of which 465 are potential high&#8208;performance catalysts. The new methodology will facilitate and accelerate the discovery of new catalysts for a wide range of heterogeneous redox reactions.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes utilizing a Europium&#8208;Activated Calcium Oxide Phosphor with External Quantum Efficiency of up to 54.7%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photoluminescence quantum efficiency of a CaO:Eu NIR phosphor is significantly improved and stabilized at high temperature. By utilizing GeO2 decomposition, the oxygen vacancies in the CaO lattice are effectively repaired. A record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency of 54.7% at 740 nm is obtained with a thermal stability greatly improved from 57% to 90% at 125&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) luminescence materials with broadband emissions are necessary for the development of light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) based light sources. However, most known NIR&#8208;emitting materials are limited by their low external quantum efficiency. This work demonstrates how the photoluminescence quantum efficiency of europium&#8208;activated calcium oxide (CaO:Eu) NIR phosphor can be significantly improved and stabilized at operating temperatures of LEDs. A carbon paper wrapping technology is innovatively developed and used during the solid&#8208;state sintering to promote the reduction of Eu3+ into Eu2+. In parallel, the oxygen vacancies in the CaO lattice are repaired utilizing GeO2 decomposition. Through this process, a record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency of 54.7% at 740 nm is obtained with a thermal stability greatly improved from 57% to 90% at 125&#160;&#176;C. The as&#8208;fabricated NIR&#8208;LEDs reach record photoelectric efficiency (100 mA@23.4%) and output power (100 mA&#8202;@&#8202;319.5 mW). This discovery of high&#8208;performance phosphors will open new research avenues for broadband NIR LED light sources in a variety of photonics applications.

         <title>Reinforced Layered Double Hydroxide Oxygen&#8208;Evolution Electrocatalysts: A Polyoxometallic Acid Wet&#8208;Etching Approach and Synergistic Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multiskilled polyoxometallic acid etching approach to ingeniously reconstructing nickel&#8211;iron&#8208;based layered double hydroxides through morphology optimization, active site synergistic regulation, and defect regulation as a promising electrode post&#8208;treatment technique toward industrial anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane electrolyzer applications is reported.








Abstract
Nickel&#8211;iron&#8208;based layered double hydroxides (NiFe LDHs) have attracted tremendous research and industrial interests for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysis. However, methodologies on simultaneous regulation of performance&#8208;influencing factors remain scarce and their real synergistic effects are not clear enough. Herein, a versatile polyoxometallic acids (POMs) etching approach is reported to ingeniously reconstruct NiFe LDH, including 3D morphological nanotailoring, Fe3+ and &#945;&#8208;Ni(OH)2 active species reconfiguration, creation of multiple Ni, Fe, and O vacancies, and intercalation of POM polyanionic clusters. The experimental and theoretical data collaboratively unveil that control of the key performance&#8208;influencing factors and their multiple synergistic mechanisms dominantly contribute to the step&#8208;like OER performance enhancement. The reinforced electrocatalyst is further produced with low cost and high performance up to &#1060;180 mm in diameter, showing its feasibility and advancement of the promising configuration of NiFe LDH&#8208;PMo12(+) II Ni@NiFe LDH(&#8722;) for alkaline anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane electrode stack cells. Furthermore, to mathematically evaluate the evolution, a novel empirical formula is proposed for quantitative identification of structure&#8211;activity correlations, which offers an opportunity for first and fast reliability on materials screening.

         <title>Molybdenum Carbide Electrocatalyst In Situ Embedded in Porous Nitrogen&#8208;Rich Carbon Nanotubes Promotes Rapid Kinetics in Sodium&#8208;Metal&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The charge&#8208;storage kinetics of a sulfur&#8208;based sodium&#8208;metal battery are accelerated by incorporating highly redox&#8208;active MoC/Mo2C nanoparticles at the cathode. First&#8208;principle calculations shed fundamental insight on the source of this electrocatalytic enhancement. The resultant Na&#8211;S cells deliver among the most promising rate performance and cycling stabilities in the literature.








Abstract
This is the first report of molybdenum carbide&#8208;based electrocatalyst for sulfur&#8208;based sodium&#8208;metal batteries. MoC/Mo2C is in situ grown on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes in parallel with formation of extensive nanoporosity. Sulfur impregnation (50 wt%&#160;S)&#160;results in unique triphasic architecture termed molybdenum carbide&#8211;porous carbon nanotubes host (MoC/Mo2C@PCNT&#8211;S). Quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state phase transformation to Na2S is promoted in carbonate electrolyte, with in situ time&#8208;resolved Raman, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and optical analyses demonstrating minimal soluble polysulfides. MoC/Mo2C@PCNT&#8211;S cathodes deliver among the most promising rate performance characteristics in the literature, achieving 987 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1, 818 mAh g&#8722;1 at 3 A g&#8722;1, and 621 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 A g&#8722;1. The cells deliver superior cycling stability, retaining 650 mAh g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles at 1.5 A g&#8722;1, corresponding to 0.028% capacity decay per cycle. High mass loading cathodes (64 wt%&#160;S,&#160;12.7&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) also show cycling stability. Density functional theory demonstrates that formation energy of Na2Sx (1 &#8804; x&#160;&#8804; 4) on surface of MoC/Mo2C is significantly lowered compared to analogous redox in liquid. Strong binding of Na2Sx (1 &#8804; x&#160;&#8804; 4) on MoC/Mo2C surfaces results from charge transfer between the sulfur and Mo sites on carbides&#8217; surface.

         <title>Optimally&#8208;Tailored Spinodal Architected Materials for Multiscale Design and Manufacturing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spinodal architected materials with tunable anisotropy directly target stiffness and lightweightness in optimal design and indirectly promote biological functions via microscale porosity and randomness. Their functional representation is also exploited for scalable multiscale manufacturing. As an example, a multiscale craniofacial implant is designed to support masticatory forces and microscale porosity is tailored upon manufacturing to promote bone regeneration and repair.








Abstract
Spinodal architected materials with tunable anisotropy unify optimal design and manufacturing of multiscale structures. By locally varying the spinodal class, orientation, and porosity during topology optimization, a large portion of the anisotropic material space is exploited such that material is efficiently placed along principal stress trajectories at the microscale. Additionally, the bicontinuous, nonperiodic, unstructured, and stochastic nature of spinodal architected materials promotes mechanical and biological functions not explicitly considered during optimization (e.g., insensitivity to imperfections, fluid transport conduits). Furthermore, in contrast to laminated composites or periodic, structured architected materials (e.g., lattices), the functional representation of spinodal architected materials leads to multiscale, optimized designs with clear physical interpretation that can be manufactured directly, without special treatment at spinodal transitions. Physical models of the optimized, spinodal&#8208;embedded parts are manufactured using a scalable, voxel&#8208;based strategy to communicate with a masked stereolithography (m&#8208;SLA) 3D&#160;printer.

         <title>Coupling Lipid Nanoparticle Structure and Automated Single&#8208;Particle Composition Analysis to Design Phospholipase&#8208;Responsive Nanocarriers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structured lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are characterized using Raman, X&#8208;ray, and neutron scattering to quantify the activity of the enzyme phospholipase D (PLD). Combining single&#8208;particle and bulk analysis for static and dynamic systems enables a label&#8208;free dynamic monitoring of PLD activity in LNPs. This demonstrates that particle structure drives the interaction of lipid nanocarriers with PLD.








Abstract
Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are versatile structures with tunable physicochemical properties that are ideally suited as a platform for vaccine delivery and RNA therapeutics. A key barrier to LNP rational design is the inability to relate composition and structure to intracellular processing and function. Here Single Particle Automated Raman Trapping Analysis (SPARTA) is combined with small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray and neutron scattering (SAXS/SANS) techniques to link LNP composition with internal structure and morphology and to monitor dynamic LNP&#8211;phospholipase D (PLD) interactions. This analysis demonstrates that PLD, a key intracellular trafficking mediator, can access the entire LNP lipid membrane to generate stable, anionic LNPs. PLD activity on vesicles with matched amounts of enzyme substrate is&#160;an order of magnitude lower, indicating that the LNP lipid membrane structure can be used to control enzyme interactions. This represents an opportunity to design enzyme&#8208;responsive LNP solutions for stimuli&#8208;responsive delivery and diseases where PLD is dysregulated.

         <title>Salt&#8208;Assisted 2H&#8208;to&#8208;1T&#8242; Phase Transformation of Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Common metal salts are used to realize the controlled phase transformation of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) from the conventional thermodynamically stable 2H phase to unconventional metastable 1T&#8242; phase. This work not only paves the way to prepare high&#8208;quality and high&#8208;purity unconventional metastable 1T&#8242;&#8208;TMDs for fundamental and practical investigations, but also greatly simplifies the procedure for the large&#8208;scale production of 1T&#8242;&#8208;TMDs.








Abstract
Phase engineering of nanomaterials (PEN) has demonstrated great potential in the fields of catalysis, electronics, energy storage and conversion, and condensed matter physics. Recently, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) with unconventional metastable phases (e.g., 1T and 1T&#8242;) have attracted increasing research interest due to their unique and appealing physicochemical properties. However, there is still a lack of a simple, universal, and controlled method for the preparation of large&#8208;scale and high&#8208;purity unconventional&#8208;phase TMD crystals, restricting their further fundamental study and practical applications. Here, a facile, one&#8208;step salt&#8208;assisted general strategy is reported for the controlled phase transformation of commercially available TMDs with conventional 2H phase, yielding a large amount of metastable 1T&#8242;&#8208;phase TMDs, including WS2, WSe2, MoS2, and MoSe2. It is found that the easily accessible metal salts, such as K2C2O4&#183;H2O, K2CO3, Na2CO3, Rb2CO3, Cs2CO3, KHCO3, NaHCO3, and NaC2O4, can be used to assist the 2H&#8208;to&#8208;1T&#8242; phase transformation, greatly simplifying the synthetic process for producing metastable 1T&#8242;&#8208;TMDs. Importantly, this method can also be used to prepare 1T&#8242;&#8208;TMD alloys, such as 1T&#8242;&#8208;WS2xSe2(1&#8722;x). This newly developed strategy is robust and highly effective, which can also be used for the phase engineering of other materials with various polymorphs.

         <title>Powering &#8776;50 &#181;m Motion by a Molecular Event in DNA Crystals</title>

A major challenge in material design is to translate molecular events to macroscale properties. In this work, self&#8208;assembled DNA crystals are shown to reversibly expand and contract over 50 &#956;m in response to versatile stimuli.








Abstract
A major challenge in material design is to couple nanoscale molecular and supramolecular events into desired chemical, physical, and mechanical properties at the macroscopic scale. Here, a novel self&#8208;assembled DNA crystal actuator is reported, which has reversible, directional expansion and contraction for over 50 &#956;m in response to versatile stimuli, including temperature, ionic strength, pH, and redox potential. The macroscopic actuation is powered by cooperative dissociation or cohesion of thousands of DNA sticky ends at the designed crystal contacts. The increase in crystal porosity and cavity in the expanded state dramatically enhances the crystal capability to accommodate/encapsulate nanoparticles/proteins, while the contraction enables a &#8220;sponge squeezing&#8221; motion for releasing nanoparticles. This crystal actuator is envisioned to be useful for a wide range of applications, including powering self&#8208;propelled robotics, sensing subtle environmental changes, constructing functional hybrid materials, and working in drug controlled&#8208;release systems.

         <title>Catalytic Mechanism of Oxygen Vacancies in Perovskite Oxides for Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compared with the perovskite Sr0.9TiO3&#8722;&#948;, the perovskite Sr0.9Ti0.7Mn0.3O3&#8722;&#948; (STMn0.3) with a higher concentration of oxygen vacancies exhibits superior adsorptive&#8208;catalytic performance of lithium polysulfides, and improves the utilization of sulfur. The STMn0.3 battery still delivers a superior initial specific capacity of 780&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;and a decay rate of 0.032% per cycle after 1500&#160;cycles at 2 C, enabling a high&#8208;efficiency lithium&#8211;sulfur battery.








Abstract
Defective materials have been demonstrated to possess adsorptive and catalytic properties in lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries, which can effectively solve the problems of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) shuttle and sluggish conversion kinetics during charging and discharging of Li&#8211;S batteries. However, there is still a lack of research on the quantitative relationship between the defect concentration and the adsorptive&#8208;catalytic performance of the electrode. In this work, perovskites Sr0.9Ti1&#8722;xMnxO3&#8722;&#948; (STMnx) (x&#160;=&#160;0.1&#8211;0.3) with different oxygen&#8208;vacancy concentrations are quantitatively regulated as research models. Through a series of tests of the adsorptive property and electrochemical performance, a quantitative relationship between oxygen&#8208;vacancy concentration and adsorptive&#8208;catalytic properties is established. Furthermore, the catalytic mechanism of oxygen vacancies in Li&#8211;S batteries is investigated using density functional theory calculations and in&#160;situ experiments. The increased oxygen vacancies can effectively increase the binding energy between perovskite and LiPSs, reduce the energy barrier of LiPSs decomposition reaction, and promote LiPSs conversion reaction kinetics. Therefore, the perovskite STMn0.3&#160;with high oxygen&#8208;vacancy concentrations exhibits excellent LiPSs adsorptive and catalytic properties, realizing high&#8208;efficiency Li&#8211;S batteries. This work is helpful to realize the application of the quantitative regulation strategy of defect engineering in Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Effective Passivation with Self&#8208;Organized Molecules for Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small molecules with a planar molecular skeleton exhibit effective defect&#8208;passivation capability for perovskite photovoltaics, contributed by their ordered intermolecular arrangement and well&#8208;matched size with the perovskite lattice. The passivators spontaneously form a uniform passivation network adherent to the bottom surface of perovskite films during a top&#8208;down crystallization via liquid medium annealing, which enables the best device yield in&#8208;lab efficiency of 25.05%.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding 25% over the past decade and effective passivation for the interface with high trap density plays a significant role in this process. Here, two organic molecules are studied as passivators, and it is demonstrated that an advantageous molecular geometry and intermolecular ordering, aside from the functional moieties, are of great significance for effective and extensive passivation. Besides, the passivation molecules spontaneously form a uniform passivation network adjacent to the bottom surface of perovskite films during a top&#8208;down crystallization via liquid medium annealing, which greatly reduces defect&#8208;assisted recombination throughout the whole perovskite/SnO2 interface. The champion device yields an in&#8208;lab PCE of 25.05% (certified 24.39%). The investigation provides a more comprehensive understanding of passivation and a new avenue to achieve effective bottom&#8208;interface engineering for perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>Real&#8208;Space Crystal Structure Analysis by Low&#8208;Dose Focal&#8208;Series TEM Imaging of Organic Materials with Near&#8208;Atomic Resolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) methodology, low&#8208;dose focal&#8208;series reconstruction (LD&#8208;FSR), enables near&#8208;atomic resolution of 1.6 &#197;. This method allows the distinction between co&#8208;existing organic polymorphs, and observation of crystal defects and atoms. Moreover, a new copper phthalocyanine polymorph (&#955;&#8208;CuPc) is identified using LD&#8208;FSR, resulting in real&#8208;space crystal structure elucidation.








Abstract
Structural analysis of beam&#8208;sensitive materials by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) represents a significant challenge, as high&#8208;resolution TEM (HRTEM) requires high electron doses that limit its applicability to stable inorganic materials. Beam&#8208;sensitive materials, e.g., organic crystals, must be imaged under low dose conditions, leading to problematic contrast interpretation and loss of fine structural details. Here, HRTEM imaging of organic crystalline materials with near&#8208;atomic resolution of up to 1.6 &#197; is described, which enables real&#8208;space studies of crystal structures, as well as observation of co&#8208;existing polymorphs, crystal defects, and atoms. This is made possible by a low&#8208;dose focal&#8208;series reconstruction methodology, which provides HRTEM images where contrast reflects true object structure and can be performed on contemporary cryo&#8208;EM instruments available to many research institutions. Copper phthalocyanine (CuPc), a perchlorinated analogue of CuPc, and indigo crystalline films are imaged. In the case of indigo crystals, co&#8208;existing polymorphs and individual atoms (carbonyl oxygen) can be observed. In the case of CuPc, several polymorphs are observed, including a new one, for which the crystal structure is found based on direct in&#8208;focus imaging, accomplishing real&#8208;space crystal structure elucidation. Such direct analysis can be transformative for structure studies of organic materials.

         <title>Native Ligand Carbonization Renders Common Platinum Nanoparticles Highly Durable for Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction: Annealing Temperature Matters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Native surface ligands (e.g., oleylamine and oleic acid) attached to Pt nanoparticles during synthesis can be directly converted into ultrathin, conformal graphitic shells upon thermal annealing, rendering common Pt particles highly stable catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction. This in situ ligand carbonization strategy is general and can also be applied to improve the stability of commercial Pt/C catalysts.








Abstract
Current protocols for synthesizing monodisperse platinum (Pt) nanoparticles typically involve the use of hydrocarbon molecules as surface&#8208;capping ligands. Using Pt nanoparticles as catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), however, these ligands must be removed to expose surface sites. Here, highly durable ORR catalysts are realized without ligand removal; instead, the native ligands are converted into ultrathin, conformal graphitic shells by simple thermal annealing. Strikingly, the annealing temperature is a critical factor dictating the ORR performance of Pt catalysts. Pt nanoparticles treated at 500&#160;&#176;C show a very poor ORR activity, whereas those annealed at 700&#160;&#176;C become highly active along with exceptional stability. In&#8208;depth characterization reveals that thermal treatment from 500 to 700&#160;&#176;C gradually opens up the porosity in carbon shells through graphitization. Importantly, such graphitic&#8208;shell&#8208;coated Pt catalysts exhibit a superior ORR stability, largely retaining the activity after 20 000 cycles in a membrane electrode assembly. Moreover, this ligand carbonization strategy can be extended to modify commercial Pt/C catalysts with substantially enhanced stability. This work demonstrates the feasibility of boosting the ORR performance of common Pt nanoparticles by harnessing the native surface ligands, offering a robust approach of designing highly durable catalysts for proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cells.

         <title>Coupling Localized Laser Writing and Nonlocal Recrystallization in Perovskite Crystals for Reversible Multidimensional Optical Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Performing multifield modulation of coupled localized laser writing and nonlocal moisture treatment on metal halide perovskites crystals enables the creation and manipulation of localized photoluminescence for optical encryption from 2D to 3D and 4D, such as reversible encryption&#8211;reading, repeatable erasing&#8211;refreshing, and even spatially and temporally resolved reading with high resolution.








Abstract
The ability to generate and manipulate photoluminescence (PL) with high spatial resolution has been of primary importance for applications in micro&#8208;optoelectronics, while the emerging metal halide perovskites offer novel material platforms where diverse photonic functionalities and fine structuring are constantly explored. Herein, micro&#8208;PL patterns consisting of highly luminescent CsPbBr3 nanocrystals (NCs) in nonluminescent perovskite crystals are directly fabricated by focused femtosecond laser irradiation. Further modulation with a moisture field leads to the selective dissolution of the laser&#8208;destabilized perovskite structures as revealed by density functional theory simulations, thus allowing for facile control of the reversible PL from the recrystallization of moisture&#8208;induced CsPbBr3 NCs. By leveraging the coupled laser writing and moisture modulation, multimodal information encryption is realized by reversible encryption&#8211;reading and repeatable erasing&#8211;refreshing. This optical storage mechanism is also extended to 3D and 4D by realizing spatially and temporally resolved optical encryption. The coupled multifield modulation on perovskite crystals can enable potential applications in optical storage and encryption, and offer a novel solution for the creation and manipulation of localized PL structures with high temporal and spatial resolutions.

         <title>Preparation of Amorphous SnO2&#8208;Encapsulated Multiphased Crystalline Cu Heterostructures for Highly Efficient CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three types of Cu@SnO2 nanostructures with hemicapsule, yolk&#8211;shell, and core&#8211;shell architectures are synthesized, in which a series of unconventional phases of Cu (i.e., 2H, 4H, and 6H) is observed. The obtained hemicapsule heterostructures exhibit superior CO2 reduction reaction selectivity toward CO and formate with high Faradaic efficiency (above 90%) in a wide potential window, outperforming their yolk&#8211;shell and core&#8211;shell counterparts.








Abstract
Controlling the architectures and crystal phases of metal@semiconductor heterostructures is very important for modulating their physicochemical properties and enhancing their application performances. Here, a facile one&#8208;pot wet&#8208;chemical method to synthesize three types of amorphous SnO2&#8208;encapsulated crystalline Cu heterostructures, i.e., hemicapsule, yolk&#8211;shell, and core&#8211;shell nanostructures, in which unconventional crystal phases (e.g., 2H, 4H, and 6H) and defects (e.g., stacking faults and twin boundaries) are observed in the crystalline Cu cores, is reported. The hemicapsule Cu@SnO2 heterostructures, with voids that not only expose the Cu core with unconventional phases but also retain the interface between Cu and SnO2, show an excellent electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) selectivity toward the production of CO and formate with high Faradaic efficiency (FE) above 90% in a wide potential window from &#8722;1.05 to &#8722;1.55&#160;V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)), and the highest FE of CO2RR (95.3%) is obtained at &#8722;1.45&#160;V (vs RHE). This work opens up a new way for the synthesis of new heterostructured nanomaterials with promising catalytic application.

         <title>Universal Dynamic Liquid Interface for Healing Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal method of creating a dynamic healing interface (DHI) is launched by reinforcing the defective surface and grain boundaries of perovskite film with nonvolatile 2&#8208;bromonaphthalene (BN) with a low melting point of 53&#8211;58&#160;&#176;C. Different from static interfaces, the fluid characteristic originating from the easy solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid phase conversion of the DHI not only reinforces management of defect passivation and energetics modification, but also enables effective defect real&#8208;time self&#8208;healing. High efficiencies are thus achieved for popular PSCs up to 12.05% (CsPbIBr2), 14.14% (CsPbI2Br), and 23.37% (FA0.92MA0.08PbI3).








Abstract
Healing charge&#8208;selective contact interfaces in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) highly determines the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability. However, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategies are often static by one&#8208;off formation of a functional interlayer, which delivers fixed interfacial properties during the subsequent operation. As a result, defects formed in&#8208;service will gradually deteriorate the photovoltaic performances. Herein, a dynamic healing interface (DHI) is presented by incorporating a low&#8208;melting&#8208;point small molecule onto perovskite film surface for highly efficient and stable PSCs. Arising from the reduced non&#8208;radiative recombination, the DHI boosts the PCE to 12.05% for an all&#8208;inorganic CsPbIBr2 solar cell and 14.14% for a CsPbI2Br cell, as well as 23.37% for an FA0.92MA0.08PbI3 (FA = formamidinium, MA = methylammonium) cell. The solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid phase conversion of DHI at elevated temperature causes a longitudinal infiltration into the bulk perovskite film to maximize the charge extraction, passivate defects at grain boundaries, and suppress ion migration. Furthermore, the stability is remarkably enhanced under air, heat, and persistent light&#8208;irradiation conditions, paving a universal strategy for advanced perovskite&#8208;based optoelectronics.

&lt;p&gt;Healing charge-selective contact interfaces in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) highly determines the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability. However, the state-of-the-art strategies are often static by one-off formation of a functional interlayer, which delivers fixed interfacial properties during the subsequent operation. As a result, defects formed in-service will gradually deteriorate the photovoltaic performances. Herein, a dynamic healing interface (DHI) is presented by incorporating a low-melting-point small molecule onto perovskite film surface for highly efficient and stable PSCs.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition between two topologically similar layered structures in In2Se3 breaks the speed and energy limitations of photonic memory, via reversible nonvolatile refractive index change induced by a single nanosecond pulse. In this work, the atomistic phase&#8208;change pathway between the layered structures is unraveled with in situ high&#8208;energy X&#8208;ray diffraction and integrated photonic switching with a transferred epitaxial layer is demonstrated. Detailed analysis on the volumetric effect and by nonlinear spectroscopy are provided to harness the mode coupling and loss in the hybrid device.








Abstract
The primary mechanism of optical memoristive devices relies on phase transitions between amorphous and crystalline states. The slow or energy&#8208;hungry amorphous&#8211;crystalline transitions in optical phase&#8208;change materials are detrimental to the scalability and performance of devices. Leveraging an integrated photonic platform, nonvolatile and reversible switching between two layered structures of indium selenide (In2Se3) triggered by a single nanosecond pulse is demonstrated. The high&#8208;resolution pair distribution function reveals the detailed atomistic transition pathways between the layered structures. With interlayer &#8220;shear glide&#8221; and isosymmetric phase transition, switching between the &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;structural states contains low re&#8208;configurational entropy, allowing reversible switching between layered structures. Broadband refractive index contrast, optical transparency, and volumetric effect in the crystalline&#8211;crystalline phase transition are experimentally characterized in molecular&#8208;beam&#8208;epitaxy&#8208;grown thin films and compared to ab initio calculations. The nonlinear resonator transmission spectra measure of incremental linear loss rate of 3.3&#160;GHz, introduced by a 1.5&#160;&#181;m&#8208;long In2Se3&#8208;covered layer, resulted from the combinations of material absorption and scattering.

         <title>Dirac Fermion Cloning, Moir&#233; Flat Bands, and Magic Lattice Constants in Epitaxial Monolayer Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Periodic substrate modulation perturbs the electronic states of graphene, duplicates Dirac cones, and effectively couples the two valleys of the Dirac states in epitaxial monolayer graphene. The intervalley interaction is controlled by the substrate lattice constant. Moir&#233; flat bands emerge at certain magic values of the substrate lattice constant.








Abstract
Tuning interactions between Dirac states in graphene has attracted enormous interest because it can modify the electronic spectrum of the 2D material, enhance electron correlations, and give rise to novel condensed&#8208;matter phases such as superconductors, Mott insulators, Wigner crystals, and quantum anomalous Hall insulators. Previous works predominantly focus on the flat band dispersion of coupled Dirac states from different twisted graphene layers. In this work, a new route to realizing flat band physics in monolayer graphene under a periodic modulation from substrates is proposed. Graphene/SiC heterostructure is taken as a prototypical example and it is demonstrated experimentally that the substrate modulation leads to Dirac fermion cloning and, consequently, the proximity of the two Dirac cones of monolayer graphene in momentum space. Theoretical modeling captures the cloning mechanism of the Dirac states and indicates that moir&#233; flat bands can emerge at certain magic lattice constants of the substrate, specifically when the period of modulation becomes nearly commensurate with the (3&#8201;&#215;&#8201;3)R30o\[(\sqrt 3 \; \times \;\sqrt 3 )R{30^o}\] supercell of graphene. The results show that epitaxial single monolayer graphene on suitable substrates is a promising platform for exploring exotic many&#8208;body quantum phases arising from interactions between Dirac&#160;electrons.&#160;

         <title>Van der Waals Exfoliation Processed Biopiezoelectric Submucosa Ultrathin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A van der Waals exfoliation (vdWE) method to fabricate ultrathin films down to the thickness of effective piezoelectric domains is presented. The vdWE method facilitates the detection of piezoelectricity and make the application of piezoelectric biological tissues possible. The vdWE&#8208;processed SIS (small intestinal submucosa) ultrathin film reaches the thickness of 100 nm and exhibits enhanced piezoelectricity.








Abstract
Piezoelectric biomaterials have attracted significant attention due to the potential effect of piezoelectricity on biological tissues and their versatile applications. However, the high cost and complexity of assembling and domain aligning biomolecules at a large scale, and the disordered arrangement of piezoelectric domains as well as the lack of ferroelectricity in natural biological tissues remain a roadblock toward practical applications. Here, utilizing the weak van der Waals interaction in the layered structure of small intestinal submucosa (SIS), a van der Waals exfoliation (vdWE) process is reported to fabricate ultrathin films down to the thickness of the effective piezoelectric domain. Based on that, the piezoelectric property is revealed of SIS stemming from the collagen fibril, with piezoelectric coefficients up to 4.1 pm V&#8722;1 and in&#8208;plane polarization orientation parallel to the fibril axis. Furthermore, a biosensor based on the vdWE&#8208;processed SIS film with an in&#8208;plane electrode is demonstrated that produces open&#8208;circuit voltages of &#8776;250&#160;mV under the cantilever vibration condition. The vdWE method shows great potential in facilely fabricating ultrathin films of soft tissues and biosensors.

         <title>Strain Modulation for Light&#8208;Stable n&#8211;i&#8211;p Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strain modulation strategy to constrain phase segregation in a wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite absorber by reinforcing the energy barrier for ion migration is reported. With compressive strain, the single&#8208;junction devices yield one of smallest voltage deficits of 440 mV. Moreover, the resulting perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells achieve a champion efficiency of 26.95% with improved light stability at open&#8208;circuit.








Abstract
Perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells are promising to penetrate photovoltaic market. However, the wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite absorbers used in top&#8208;cell often suffer severe phase segregation under illumination, which restricts the operation lifetime of tandem solar cells. Here, a strain modulation strategy to fabricate light&#8208;stable perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells is reported. By employing adenosine triphosphate, the residual tensile strain in the wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite absorber is successfully converted to compressive strain, which mitigates light&#8208;induced ion migration and phase segregation. Based on the wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite with compressive strain, single&#8208;junction solar cells with the n&#8211;i&#8211;p layout yield a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.53% with the smallest voltage deficits of 440&#160;mV. These cells also maintain 83.60% of initial PCE after 2500 h operation at the maximum power point. Finally, these top cells are integrated with silicon bottom cells in a monolithic tandem device, which achieves a PCE of 26.95% and improved light stability at open&#8208;circuit.

         <title>Studying Complex Evolution of Hyperelastic Materials under External Field Stimuli using Artificial Neural Networks with Spatiotemporal Features in a Small&#8208;Scale Dataset</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonlinear mechanical properties of hyperelastic materials can be viewed as responses of materials to external serial stimuli. A convolutional bidirectional long short&#8208;term memory (CBLSTM) model with spatiotemporal features is used to capture the complex evolution of structures and properties of materials under external field stimuli and to design materials with excellent performance via taking full advantage of data information even in a small&#8208;scale dataset.








Abstract
Deep&#8208;learning (DL) methods, in consideration of their excellence in dealing with highly complex structure&#8211;performance relationships for materials, are expected to become a new design paradigm for breakthroughs in material performance. However, in most cases, it is impractical to collect massive&#8208;scale experimental data or open&#8208;source theoretical databases to support training DL models with sufficient prediction accuracy. In a dataset consisting of 483 porous silicone rubber observations generated via ink&#8208;writing additive manufacturing, this work demonstrates that constructing low&#8208;dimensional, accurate descriptors is the prerequisite for obtaining high&#8208;precision DL models based on small experimental datasets. On this basis, a unique convolutional bidirectional long short&#8208;term memory model with spatiotemporal features extraction capability is designed, whose hierarchical learning mechanism further reduces the requirement for the amount of data by taking full advantage of data information. The proposed approach can be expected as a powerful tool for innovative material design on small experimental datasets, which can also be used to explore the evolutionary mechanisms of the structures and properties of materials under complex working conditions.

&lt;p&gt;Deep-learning (DL) methods, in consideration of their excellence in dealing with highly complex structure&#8211;performance relationships for materials, are expected to become a new design paradigm for breakthroughs in material performance. However, in most cases, it is impractical to collect massive-scale experimental data or open-source theoretical databases to support training DL models with sufficient prediction accuracy. In a dataset consisting of 483 porous silicone rubber observations generated via ink-writing additive manufacturing, this work demonstrates that constructing low-dimensional, accurate descriptors is the prerequisite for obtaining high-precision DL models based on small experimental datasets. On this basis, a unique convolutional bidirectional long short-term memory model with spatiotemporal features extraction capability is designed, whose hierarchical learning mechanism further reduces the requirement for the amount of data by taking full advantage of data information. The proposed approach can be expected as a powerful tool for innovative material design on small experimental datasets, which can also be used to explore the evolutionary mechanisms of the structures and properties of materials under complex working conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Identification of the Stable Pt Single Sites in the Environment of Ions: From Mechanism to Design Principle</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two kinds of Pt sites, Ptzn&#8208;sub&#8208;S3 and Ptads&#8208;S2 are identified on Pt SA&#8208;Zn0.5Cd0.5S (Pt SA&#8208;ZCS), and interesting phenomena are observed and analyzed, facing the Brownian collision of ions in the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution process, which further inspires the design of novel composite with enhanced activity.








Abstract
For single&#8208;atom (SA)&#8208;based catalysis, it is urgent to understand the nature and dynamic evolution of SA active sites during the reactions. In this work, an example of Pt SA&#8208;Zn0.5Cd0.5S (Pt SA&#8208;ZCS) is found to display interesting phenomena when facing the Brownian collision of ions in aqueous photocatalysis. Via synchrotron radiation, surface techniques, microscopy, and theory calculations, the results show that two kinds of Pt sites exist: PtZn&#8208;sub&#8208;S3 (Pt substituting the Zn site) and Ptads&#8208;S2 (Pt adsorbing on the surface). In Na2S, the S2&#8722; can coordinate with Pt atoms and peel them from the Ptads&#8208;S2 sites, but leaves more stable PtZn&#8208;sub&#8208;S3 sites, bringing a low but stable catalytic activity (19.40&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). Meanwhile, in ascorbic acid, the ascorbic acid ions show less complex ability with Pt atoms, but can decrease the migration barrier of Ptads&#8208;S2 sites (67.18 down to 35.96&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, 52.03% drop after 6 h). Therefore, the Ptads&#8208;S2 sites gradually aggregate into nanoclusters, bringing a high but decayed catalytic activity. Moreover, a Pt SA&#8208;ZCS&#8208;Sulfur composite is designed mainly covered by PtZn&#8208;sub&#8208;S3 sites accordingly (max: 79.09&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, 5% drop after 6 h and QE: 14.0% at 420&#160;nm), showing a beneficial strategy &#8220;from mechanism to design principle.&#8221;

         <title>Magnetic&#8208;Powered Janus Cell Robots Loaded with Oncolytic Adenovirus for Active and Targeted Virotherapy of Bladder Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Janus oncolytic adenovirus&#8208;loaded 293T cell robots with full coating of targeted peptides and Janus modification of magnetic nanoparticles are capable of controllable magnetic propulsion and tumor&#8208;specific binding and killing. Such active medical platform with enhanced tissue retention and penetration shows the highest therapeutic efficacy in treating orthoptic mice bladder cancer models with minimized damage to normal tissues.








Abstract
A unique robotic medical platform is designed by utilizing cell robots as the active &#8220;Trojan horse&#8221; of oncolytic adenovirus (OA), capable of tumor&#8208;selective binding and killing. The OA&#8208;loaded cell robots are fabricated by entirely modifying OA&#8208;infected 293T cells with cyclic arginine&#8211;glycine&#8211;aspartic acid tripeptide (cRGD) to specifically bind with bladder cancer cells, followed by asymmetric immobilization of Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) on the cell surface. OA can replicate in host cells and induce cytolysis to release the virus progeny to the surrounding tumor sites for sustainable infection and oncolysis. The asymmetric coating of magnetic NPs bestows the cell robots with effective movement in various media and wireless manipulation with directional migration in a microfluidic device and bladder mold under magnetic control, further enabling steerable movement and prolonged retention of cell robots in the mouse bladder. The biorecognition of cRGD and robust, controllable propulsion of cell robots work synergistically to greatly enhance their tissue penetration and anticancer efficacy in the 3D cancer spheroid and orthotopic mouse bladder tumor model. Overall, this study integrates cell&#8208;based microrobots with virotherapy to generate an attractive robotic system with tumor specificity, expanding the operation scope of cell robots in biomedical community.

         <title>Stable Universal 1&#8208; and 2&#8208;Input Single&#8208;Molecule Logic Gates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;molecule logic devices are ideal candidates for ultra&#8208;minimalistic circuit elements to perform high&#8208;density computing. Gated Au/S&#8208;(CH2)3&#8208;Fc&#8208;(CH2)9&#8208;S/Au single&#8208;electron transistors not only hold the advantage of controlling molecular orbitals (MOs) via bias and gate voltages, but also exhibit a unique electronic structure with two adjacent MOs. This provides a single&#8208;electron logic calculator to implement all universal logic gates within a single&#8208;molecule device.








Abstract
Controllable single&#8208;molecule logic operations will enable development of reliable ultra&#8208;minimalistic circuit elements for high&#8208;density computing but require stable currents from multiple orthogonal inputs in molecular junctions. Utilizing the two unique adjacent conductive molecular orbitals (MOs) of gated Au/S&#8208;(CH2)3&#8208;Fc&#8208;(CH2)9&#8208;S/Au (Fc = ferrocene) single&#8208;electron transistors (&#8776;2&#160;nm), a stable single&#8208;electron logic calculator (SELC) is presented, which allows real&#8208;time modulation of output current as a function of orthogonal input bias (Vb) and gate (Vg) voltages. Reliable and low&#8208;voltage (&#448;Vb&#448; &#8804; 80&#160;mV, &#448;Vg&#448; &#8804; 2&#160;V) operations of the SELC depend upon the unambiguous association of current resonances with energy shifts of the MOs (which show an invariable, small energy separation of &#8776;100 meV) in response to the changes of voltages, which is confirmed by electron&#8208;transport calculations. Stable multi&#8208;logic operations based on the SELC modulated current conversions between the two resonances and Coulomb blockade regimes are demonstrated via the implementation of all universal 1&#8208;input (YES/NOT/PASS_1/PASS_0) and 2&#8208;input (AND/XOR/OR/NAND/NOR/INT/XNOR) logic gates.

         <title>Implanting an Electron Donor to Enlarge the d&#8211;p Hybridization of High&#8208;Entropy (Oxy)hydroxide: A Novel Design to Boost Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel quantitative d&#8211;p hybridization theory is proposed to effectively illustrate the catalytic activity of each metal site in a high&#8208;entropy (HE) system, providing a guideline for the design/fabrication of advanced HE catalysts. Accordingly, a new way of introducing electron donors to construct catalysts with reinforced activity is raised and verified. The corresponding Ag&#8208;decorated HE Co&#8211;Cu&#8211;Fe&#8211;Ag&#8211;Mo (oxy)hydroxide electrocatalyst exhibits excellent electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction performance.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy (HE) electrocatalysts are becoming a research hotspot due to their interesting &#8220;cocktail effect&#8221; and have great potential for tailored catalytic properties. However, it is still a great challenge to illustrate their inherent catalytic mechanism for the &#8220;cocktail effect&#8221;, and there is also a paucity of quantitative descriptors to characterize the specific catalytic activity and give logical design strategies for HE systems. Herein, the unexpected activation of all metal sites in HE Cu&#8211;Co&#8211;Fe&#8211;Ag&#8211;Mo (oxy)hydroxides for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is reported, and it is found that metal&#8211;oxygen d&#8211;p hybridization, as an effective descriptor, can indicate the intrinsic activity of each metal site.

     alt="Implanting an Electron Donor to Enlarge the d&#8211;p Hybridization of High-Entropy (Oxy)hydroxide: A Novel Design to Boost Oxygen Evolution"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel quantitative d&#8211;p hybridization theory is proposed to effectively illustrate the catalytic activity of each metal site in a high-entropy (HE) system, providing a guideline for the design/fabrication of advanced HE catalysts. Accordingly, a new way of introducing electron donors to construct catalysts with reinforced activity is raised and verified. The corresponding Ag-decorated HE Co&#8211;Cu&#8211;Fe&#8211;Ag&#8211;Mo (oxy)hydroxide electrocatalyst exhibits excellent electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction performance.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-entropy (HE) electrocatalysts are becoming a research hotspot due to their interesting &#8220;cocktail effect&#8221; and have great potential for tailored catalytic properties. However, it is still a great challenge to illustrate their inherent catalytic mechanism for the &#8220;cocktail effect&#8221;, and there is also a paucity of quantitative descriptors to characterize the specific catalytic activity and give logical design strategies for HE systems. Herein, the unexpected activation of all metal sites in HE Cu&#8211;Co&#8211;Fe&#8211;Ag&#8211;Mo (oxy)hydroxides for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is reported, and it is found that metal&#8211;oxygen d&#8211;p hybridization, as an effective descriptor, can indicate the intrinsic activity of each metal site. According to the quantitative hybridization, introducing an electron donor (e.g., Ag) is raised and verified to reinforce the electrocatalytic activity of the HE system. Consequently, Ag-decorated Co&#8211;Cu&#8211;Fe&#8211;Ag&#8211;Mo (oxy)hydroxide (Ag@CoCuFeAgMoOOH) electrocatalysts are constructed by an electrochemical reconstruction method, and their OER performances are thoroughly characterized. The Ag@CoCuFeAgMoOOH is verified with a low overpotential (270&#160;mV at 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and a small Tafel slope (35.3&#160;mV&#160;dec&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), as well as good electrochemical stability. The favorable activity of the electron donor and underlying synergistic &#8220;cocktail effect&#8221; are demonstrated and disclosed. This work opens up a new strategy to guide the design/fabrication of advanced HE electrocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Steric Engineering Enables Efficient and Photostable Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskites for All&#8208;Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient and photostable wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskites (&#8776;1.8&#160;eV) with only 25&#160;mol% bromide are enabled by steric engineering via alloying dimethylammonium and chloride. The WBG single&#8208;junction cells, with a high efficiency of 17.7%, exhibit promising operational stability under 1&#8208;sun illumination (T90 of 1045 h). This strategy enables all&#8208;perovskite tandem with an impressive stabilized efficiency of 26.0%.








Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG, &#8776;1.8&#160;eV) perovskite is a crucial component to pair with narrow&#8208;bandgap perovskite in low&#8208;cost monolithic all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells. However, the stability and efficiency of WBG perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are constrained by the light&#8208;induced halide segregation and by the large photovoltage deficit. Here, a steric engineering to obtain high&#8208;quality and photostable WBG perovskites (&#8776;1.8&#160;eV) suitable for all&#8208;perovskite tandems is reported. By alloying dimethylammonium and chloride into the mixed&#8208;cation mixed&#8208;halide perovskites, wide bandgaps are obtained with much lower bromide contents while the lattice strain and trap densities are simultaneously minimized. The WBG PSCs exhibit considerably improved performance and photostability, retaining &gt;90%&#160;of their initial efficiencies after 1000 h of operation at maximum power point. With the triple&#8208;cation/triple&#8208;halide WBG perovskites enabled by steric engineering, a stabilized power conversion efficiency of 26.0% in all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells is further obtained. The strategy provides an avenue to fabricate efficient and stable WBG subcells for multijunction photovoltaic devices.

         <title>A Multitasking Flexible Sensor via Reservoir Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multitasking, flexible sensor sheet for monitoring of weather information via a flexible resistive sensor and reservoir computing is reported. This sensor and reservoir computing combination enables the device to estimate water droplet volume and wind velocity with a small training dataset. An important advance is to realize multiple parameter detection simultaneously using only one flexible sensor.








Abstract
Natural disasters are reported globally, and one source of severe damage to cities is flooding caused by locally heavy rain. Sharing of local weather information can save lives. However, it is difficult to collect local weather information in real&#8208;time because such data collection requires bulky, expensive sensors. For local, real&#8208;time monitoring of heavy rain and wind, a sensor system should be simple and low&#8208;cost so that it can be attached to a variety of surfaces, including roofs, vehicles, and umbrellas. To develop simple, low&#8208;cost multitasking sensors located on nonplanar surfaces, a flexible rain sensor to monitor waterdrop volume and wind velocity is devised. To monitor both simultaneously, a laser&#8208;induced graphene&#8208;based superhydrophobic conductive film is introduced. Using the superhydrophobic surface, water dynamics are measured when waterdrops collide with the sensor surface, and obtained time&#8208;series data are processed using &#8220;reservoir computing&#8221; to extract the volume and velocity from a single sensor as multitasking electronics. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, it is shown that the sensor measures continuous, long&#8208;term volume and wind&#8208;change dynamics. The results demonstrate feasibility of multitasking electronics with reservoir computing to reduce sensor integration complexity with low power consumption for both sensor and signal processing.

         <dc:description>
A new family of 2D transition metal carbo&#8208;chalcogenides (TMCCs) can be considered an atomic&#8208;level combination of TM carbides (MXenes) and TM dichalcogenides (TMDCs). Realized by electrochemical&#8208;assisted delamination, Nb2S2C and Ta2S2C are the first examples of TMCCs to be delaminated into single layers. These newly developed 2D TMCCs are 50% stronger than TMDC counterparts and have a wide range of applications.








Abstract
Here, a new family of 2D transition metal carbo&#8208;chalcogenides (TMCCs) is reported, which can be considered a combination of two well&#8208;known families, TM carbides (MXenes) and TM dichalcogenides (TMDCs), at the atomic level. Single sheets are successfully obtained from multilayered Nb2S2C and Ta2S2C using electrochemical lithiation followed by sonication in water. The parent multilayered TMCCs are synthesized using a simple, scalable solid&#8208;state synthesis followed by a topochemical reaction. Superconductivity transition is observed at 7.55 K for Nb2S2C. The delaminated Nb2S2C outperforms both multilayered Nb2S2C and delaminated NbS2 as an electrode material for Li&#8208;ion batteries. Ab initio calculations predict the elastic constant of TMCC to be over 50% higher than that of TMDC.

         <title>In&#8208;Memory Computing using Memristor Arrays with Ultrathin 2D PdSeOx/PdSe2 Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;voltage memristor array based on ultrathin PdSeOx/PdSe2 heterostructure is demonstrated using controllable ultraviolet&#8211;ozone treatment. By confining the formation of conductive filaments in the heterostructure, the memristor achieves a remarkable uniform switching with low set and reset voltage variability of 4.8% and &#8722;3.6%, respectively. The crossbar array further enables multiple convolutional image processing with a high image&#8208;recognition accuracy of &#8776;93.4%.








Abstract
In&#8208;memory computing based on memristor arrays holds promise to address the speed and energy issues of the classical von Neumann computing system. However, the stochasticity of ions&#8217; transport in conventional oxide&#8208;based memristors imposes severe intrinsic variability, which compromises learning accuracy and hinders the implementation of neural network hardware accelerators. Here, these challenges are addressed using a low&#8208;voltage memristor array based on an ultrathin PdSeOx/PdSe2 heterostructure switching medium realized by a controllable ultraviolet (UV)&#8211;ozone treatment. A distinctively different ions&#8217; transport mechanism is revealed in the heterostructure that can confine the formation of conductive filaments, leading to a remarkable uniform switching with low set and reset voltage variability values of 4.8% and &#8722;3.6%, respectively. Moreover, convolutional image processing is further implemented using various crossbar kernels that achieve a high recognition accuracy of &#8776;93.4% due to the highly linear and symmetric analog weight update as well as multiple conductance states, manifesting its potential beyond von Neumann computing.

The crossbar array further enables multiple convolutional image processing with a high image-recognition accuracy of &#8776;93.4%.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In-memory computing based on memristor arrays holds promise to address the speed and energy issues of the classical von Neumann computing system. However, the stochasticity of ions&#8217; transport in conventional oxide-based memristors imposes severe intrinsic variability, which compromises learning accuracy and hinders the implementation of neural network hardware accelerators. Here, these challenges are addressed using a low-voltage memristor array based on an ultrathin PdSeO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;/PdSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; heterostructure switching medium realized by a controllable ultraviolet (UV)&#8211;ozone treatment. A distinctively different ions&#8217; transport mechanism is revealed in the heterostructure that can confine the formation of conductive filaments, leading to a remarkable uniform switching with low set and reset voltage variability values of 4.8% and &#8722;3.6%, respectively. Moreover, convolutional image processing is further implemented using various crossbar kernels that achieve a high recognition accuracy of &#8776;93.4% due to the highly linear and symmetric analog weight update as well as multiple conductance states, manifesting its potential beyond von Neumann computing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nanostructured Metallic Glass in a Highly Upgraded Energy State Contributing to Efficient Catalytic Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrodeposited Ni&#8211;P nanostructured metallic glass (NG) is located in an extremely high energy state due to its heterogeneous structure, which significantly promotes its catalytic performance. Modified Ni&#8211;P NG displays the best urea oxidation reaction (UOR) performance of Ni&#8208;based alloys, with a low potential of 1.36 V @ 10 mA cm&#8211;2, and a Tafel slope of 13 mV dec&#8722;1.








Abstract
Metallic glasses (MGs), with high density of low coordination sites and high Gibbs free energy state, are novel promising and competitive candidates in the family of electrochemical catalysts. However, it remains a grand challenge to modify the properties of MGs by control of the disordered atomic structure. Recently, nanostructured metallic glasses (NGs), consisting of amorphous nanometer&#8208;sized grains connected by amorphous interfaces, have been reported to exhibit tunable properties compared to the MGs with identical chemical composition. Here, it is demonstrated that electrodeposited Ni&#8211;P NG is characterized by an extremely high energy state due to its heterogeneous structure, which significantly promotes the catalytic performance. Moreover, the Ni&#8211;P NG with a heterogeneous structure is a perfect precursor for the fabrication of unique honey&#8208;like nanoporous structure, which displays superior catalytic performance in the urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Specifically, modified Ni&#8211;P NG requires a potential of mere 1.36&#160;V at 10&#160;mA cm&#8211;2, with a Tafel slope of 13&#160;mV dec&#8211;1, which is the best UOR performance in Ni&#8208;based alloys. The present work demonstrates that the nanostructurization of MGs provides a universal and effective pathway to upgrade the energy state of MGs for the design of high&#8208;performance catalysts in energy conversion.

         <title>Defective Fe Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Enhance Metabolic Profiling for High&#8208;Accuracy Diagnosis of Human Cancers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A precisely engineered metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) is developed as the matrix for laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry for the acquisition of serum metabolic fingerprints. Fe&#8208;MOF&#8208;UL with favorable charge transfer and mitigated thermal dissipation achieves &#8776;10&#160;000&#8208;fold signal enhancement and leads to high&#8208;accuracy diagnosis of three major cancers, promising a universal detection tool for human cancers.








Abstract
Cancers heavily threaten human life; therefore, a high&#8208;accuracy diagnosis is vital to protect human beings from the suffering of cancers. While biopsies and imaging methods are widely used as current technologies for cancer diagnosis, a new detection platform by metabolic analysis is expected due to the significant advantages of fast, simple, and cost&#8208;effectiveness with high body tolerance. However, the signal of molecule biomarkers is too weak to acquire high&#8208;accuracy diagnosis. Herein, precisely engineered metal&#8211;organic frameworks for laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry, allowing favorable charge transfer within the molecule&#8211;substrate interface and mitigated thermal dissipation by adjusting the phonon scattering with metal nodes, are developed. Consequently, a surprising signal enhancement of &#8776;10 000&#8208;fold is achieved, resulting in diagnosis of three major cancers (liver/lung/kidney cancer) with area&#8208;under&#8208;the&#8208;curve of 0.908&#8211;0.964 and accuracy of 83.2%&#8211;90.6%, which promises a universal detection tool for large&#8208;scale clinical diagnosis of human cancers.

         <title>Single&#8208;Junction Organic Solar Cells with 19.17% Efficiency Enabled by Introducing One Asymmetric Guest Acceptor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new ternary system is developed by introducing an asymmetric electron acceptor BTP&#8208;2F2Cl into the PM1:L8&#8208;BO host system. The ternary system exhibits a record&#8208;high efficiency of 19.17% and demonstrates better long&#8208;term stability compared to the host system.








Abstract
The ternary strategy has been widely identified as an effective approach to obtain high&#8208;efficiency organic solar cells (OSCs). However, for most ternary OSCs, the nonradiative voltage loss lies between those of the two binary devices, which limits further efficiency improvements. Herein, an asymmetric guest acceptor BTP&#8208;2F2Cl is designed and incorporated into a PM1:L8&#8208;BO host blend. Compared with the L8&#8208;BO neat film, the L8&#8208;BO:BTP&#8208;2F2Cl blend film shows higher photoluminescence quantum yield and larger exciton diffusion length. Introducing BTP&#8208;2F2Cl into the host blend extends its absorption spectrum, improves the molecular packing of host materials, and suppresses the nonradiative charge recombination of the ternary OSCs. Consequently, the power conversion efficiency is improved up to 19.17% (certified value 18.7%), which represents the highest efficiency value reported for single&#8208;junction OSCs so far. The results show that improving the exciton behaviors is a promising approach to reducing the nonradiative voltage loss and realizing high&#8208;performance OSCs.

         <title>Progress and Future Prospects of Wide&#8208;Bandgap Metal&#8208;Compound&#8208;Based Passivating Contacts for Silicon Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Given the increasing interest in searching for high&#8208;quality low&#8208;cost passivating contacts for c&#8208;Si solar cells, the fundamentals and development status of wide&#8208;bandgap metal&#8208;compound&#8208;based passivating contacts are reviewed and the challenges and potential solutions in developing highly transparent passivating contacts with excellent carrier selectivity are discussed. Based on in&#8208;depth data analysis and simulations, the improvement strategies for metal&#8208;compound&#8208;based passivating contacts design and device integration are pointed out.








Abstract
Advanced doped&#8208;silicon&#8208;layer&#8208;based passivating contacts have boosted the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single&#8208;junction crystalline silicon (c&#8208;Si) solar cells to over 26%. However, the inevitable parasitic light absorption of the doped silicon layers impedes further PCE improvement. To this end, alternative passivating contacts based on wide&#8208;bandgap metal compounds (so&#8208;called dopant&#8208;free passivating contacts (DFPCs)) have attracted great attention, thanks to their potential merits in terms of parasitic absorption loss, ease&#8208;of&#8208;deposition, and cost. Intensive research activity has surrounded this topic with significant progress made in recent years. Various electron&#8208;selective and hole&#8208;selective contacts based on metal compounds have been successfully developed, and a champion PCE of 23.5% has been achieved for a c&#8208;Si solar cell with a MoOx&#8208;based hole&#8208;selective contact. In this work, the fundamentals and development status of DFPCs are reviewed and the challenges and potential solutions for enhancing the carrier selectivity of DFPCs are discussed. Based on comprehensive and in&#8208;depth analysis and simulations, the improvement strategies and future prospects for DFPCs design and device implementation are pointed out. By tuning the carrier concentration of the metal compound and the work function of the capping transparent electrode, high PCEs over 26% can be achieved for c&#8208;Si solar cells with DFPCs.

         <title>Simultaneous Electrochemical Exfoliation and Covalent Functionalization of MoS2 Membrane for Ion Sieving</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through exfoliation of the electrochemically lithium&#8208;intercalated MoS2 in iodoacetamide water solution, the covalent functionalization of single&#8208;layer MoS2 with iodoacetamide molecules can be shortened to 15 min, and functionalized MoS2 membranes are fabricated via vacuum filtration. Under reverse osmosis mode, the functionalized MoS2 membranes exhibit rejection rates of &gt;90% and &gt;80% for various dyes and NaCl, respectively.








Abstract
Transition metal dichalcogenide membranes exhibit good antiswelling properties but poor water desalination property. Here, a one&#8208;step covalent functionalization of MoS2 nanosheets for membrane fabrication is reported, which is accomplished by simultaneous exfoliating and grafting the lithium&#8208;ion&#8208;intercalated MoS2 in organic iodide water solution. The lithium intercalation amount in MoS2 is optimized so that the quality of the produced 2D nanosheets is improved with homogeneous size distribution. The lamellar MoS2 membranes are tested in reverse osmosis (RO), and the functionalized MoS2 membrane exhibits rejection rates of &gt;90% and &gt;80% for various dyes (Rhodamine B, Crystal Violet, Acid Fuchsin, Methyl Orange, and Evans Blue) and NaCl, respectively. The excellent ion&#8208;sieving performance and good water permeability of the functionalized MoS2 membranes are attributed to the suitable channel widths that are tuned by iodoacetamide. Furthermore, the stability of the functionalized MoS2 membranes in NaCl and dye solutions is also confirmed by RO tests. Molecular dynamics simulation shows that water molecules tend to form a single layer between the amide&#8208;functionalized MoS2 layers but a double layer between the ethanol&#8208;functionalized MoS2 (MoS2&#8208;ethanol) layers, which indicates that a less packed structure of water between the MoS2&#8208;ethanol layers leads to lower hydrodynamic resistance and higher permeation.

         <title>Nontrivial Doping Evolution of Electronic Properties in Ising&#8208;Superconducting Alloys</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates the feasibility of synthesizing stable aliovalent alloys of transition metal dichalcogenide materials in the single&#8208;layer limit throughout the entire alloy composition range. Furthermore, an experimental and theoretical atomic&#8208;scale characterization of the evolution of the electronic ground state (both the electronic structure and collective electronic phases) of a 2D Ising superconductor (single&#8208;layer NbSe2) with structural disorder is reported.








Abstract
Transition metal dichalcogenides offer unprecedented versatility to engineer 2D materials with tailored properties to explore novel structural and electronic phase transitions. In this work, the atomic&#8208;scale evolution of the electronic ground state of a monolayer of Nb1&#8722;&#948;Mo&#948;Se2 across the entire alloy composition range (0 &lt; &#948;&#160;&lt; 1) is investigated using low&#8208;temperature (300 mK) scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS). In particular, the atomic and electronic structure of this 2D alloy throughout the metal to semiconductor transition (monolayer NbSe2 to MoSe2) is studied. The measurements enable extraction of the effective doping of Mo atoms, the bandgap evolution and the band shifts, which are monotonic with &#948;. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that collective electronic phases (charge density wave and superconductivity) are remarkably robust against disorder and further shown that the superconducting TC changes non&#8208;monotonically with doping. This contrasting behavior in the normal and superconducting state is explained using first&#8208;principles calculations. Mo doping is shown to decrease the density of states at the Fermi level and the magnitude of pair&#8208;breaking spin fluctuations as a function of Mo content. These results paint a detailed picture of the electronic structure evolution in 2D TMD alloys, which is of utmost relevance for future 2D materials design.

Flexible Sensors
In article number 2201663, Kohei Nakajima, Kuniharu Takei, and co&#8208;workers propose a multitasking flexible sensor realized by using reservoir computing analysis to estimate rain&#8208;droplet volume and wind flow for future weathercasting. Surface morphology and conditions of the sensor are investigated to detect continuous water&#8208;droplet conductivity precisely, and an optimized reservoir computing algorithm is applied for water&#8208;volume and wind&#8208;flow estimations using a single sensor.

Catalytic Active Sites
In article number 2201328, Guowei Li, B. Andrei Bernevig, Claudia Felser, and co&#8208;workers propose a descriptor to predicate the position of catalytic active sites fast and precisely.

Spinodal Architected Materials
In article number 2109304, Glaucio H. Paulino and co&#8208;workers report spinodal architected materials with tunable anisotropy to unify optimal design and manufacturing of multiscale structures. Mechanical anisotropy and porosity are spatially tailored to directly target mechanical function (e.g., stiffness) and indirectly promote biological function (e.g., fluid transport conduits). Applications to medical (e.g., prosthetics) and mechanical components are demonstrated.

Single&#8208;Molecule Devices
In article number 2202135, Zong&#8208;Liang Li, Christian A. Nijhuis, Enrique Del Barco, and co&#8208;workers report a single&#8208;electron logic calculator formed by a gated Au/S&#8208;(CH2)3&#8208;Fc&#8208;(CH2)9&#8208;S/Au transistor. The unique adjacent conductive molecular orbitals in the Fc moiety are controlled by the orthogonal bias and gate voltages, resulting in the implementation of all universal logic gates within a single&#8208;molecule device.

Transition Metal Carbo&#8208;Chalcogenides
In article number 2200574, Michael Naguib and co&#8208;workers report on the synthesis of 2D transition metal carbo&#8208;chalcogenides (TMCCs) by exfoliating their bulk layered counterparts (e.g., Nb2S2C and Ta2S2C) through electrochemical Li&#8208;ion intercalation followed by agitation in water. 2D TMCCs combine the surface of 2D TM dichalcogenides (TMDCs) and the core of 2D TM carbides (MXenes) offering unique characteristics of both TMDCs and MXenes.

         <title>Engineered Living Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The convergence of engineering, biology, and materials science is providing unprecedented opportunities to integrate living microbes into hydrogel matrices. This integration constructs engineered living hydrogels with the capability of performing tasks associated with living microbes such as self&#8208;replication, self&#8208;adaption, and environmental responsiveness.








Abstract
Living biological systems, ranging from single cells to whole organisms, can sense, process information, and actuate in response to changing environmental conditions. Inspired by living biological systems, engineered living cells and nonliving matrices are brought together, which gives rise to the technology of engineered living materials. By designing the functionalities of living cells and the structures of nonliving matrices, engineered living materials can be created to detect variability in the surrounding environment and to adjust their functions accordingly, thereby enabling applications in health monitoring, disease treatment, and environmental remediation. Hydrogels, a class of soft, wet, and biocompatible materials, have been widely used as matrices for engineered living cells, leading to the nascent field of engineered living hydrogels. Here, the interactions between hydrogel matrices and engineered living cells are described, focusing on how hydrogels influence cell behaviors and how cells affect hydrogel properties. The interactions between engineered living hydrogels and their environments, and how these interactions enable versatile applications, are also discussed. Finally, current challenges facing the field of engineered living hydrogels for their applications in clinical and environmental settings are highlighted.

         <title>Thermoplasmonics in Solar Energy Conversion: Materials, Nanostructured Designs, and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on recent developments of thermoplasmonics in the solar energy field. The physics fundamentals behind thermoplasmonics are elaborated, basic strategies of material and nanostructured designs toward more efficient photothermal conversion are summarized. Then, recent advances are reviewed for targeted applications including solar evaporation, photothermal chemistry, and thermophotovoltaics. Finally, the corresponding challenges and prospects are discussed.








Abstract
The indispensable requirement for sustainable development of human society has forced almost all countries to seek highly efficient and cost&#8208;effective ways to harvest and convert solar energy. Though continuous progress has advanced, it remains a daunting challenge to achieve full&#8208;spectrum solar absorption and maximize the conversion efficiency of sunlight. Recently, thermoplasmonics has emerged as a promising solution, which involves several beneficial effects including enhanced light absorption and scattering, generation and relaxation of hot carriers, as well as localized/collective heating, offering tremendous opportunities for optimized energy conversion. Besides, all these functionalities can be tailored via elaborated designs of materials and nanostructures. Here, first the fundamental physics governing thermoplasmonics is presented and then the strategies for both material selection and nanostructured designs toward more efficient energy conversion are summarized. Based on this, recent progress in thermoplasmonic applications including solar evaporation, photothermal chemistry, and thermophotovoltaic is reviewed. Finally, the corresponding challenges and prospects are discussed.

         <title>Recent Structural Engineering of Polymer Semiconductors Incorporating Hydrogen Bonds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of hydrogen bonds can enhance the planarity and rigidity of polymer semiconductors via noncovalent interactions, improve the charge transport, and offer polymers unique superiority of mechanical flexibility. This review describes the recent structural evolution of polymer semiconductors containing hydrogen bonds and the effect of hydrogen bonds on carrier mobility, self&#8208;healing, chemical sensitivity, and mechanical properties.








Abstract
Highly planar, extended &#960;&#8208;electron organic conjugated polymers have been increasingly attractive for achieving high&#8208;mobility organic semiconductors. In addition to the conventional strategy to construct rigid backbone by covalent bonds, hydrogen bond has been employed extensively to increase the planarity and rigidity of polymer via intramolecular noncovalent interactions. This review provides a general summary of high&#8208;mobility semiconducting polymers incorporating hydrogen bonds in field&#8208;effect transistors over recent years. The structural engineering of the hydrogen bond&#8208;containing building blocks and the discussion of theoretical simulation, microstructural characterization, and device performance are covered. Additionally, the effects of the introduction of hydrogen bond on self&#8208;healing, stretchability, chemical sensitivity, and mechanical properties are also discussed. The review aims to help and inspire design of new high&#8208;mobility conjugated polymers with superiority of mechanical flexibility by incorporation of hydrogen bond for the application in flexible electronics.

         <title>Are Liquid Metals Bulk Conductors?</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this article, the wide variety of electromechanical responses of liquid metal stretchable electronics reported in the literature are reviewed. Complementing this review with&#160;our&#160;own measurements, the relative change in resistance of EGaIn is found to be lower than that of a bulk conductor. Then, possible explanations for the discrepancies are dicussed and suggestions are provided on experimental design for future research.








Abstract
Stretchable electronics have potential in wide&#8208;reaching applications including wearables, personal health monitoring, and soft robotics. Many recent advances in stretchable electronics leverage liquid metals, particularly eutectic gallium&#8208;indium (EGaIn). A variety of EGaIn electromechanical behaviors have been reported, ranging from bulk conductor responses to effectively strain&#8208;insensitive responses. However, numerous measurement techniques have been used throughout the literature, making it difficult to directly compare the various proposed formulations. Here, the electromechanical responses of EGaIn found in the literature is reviewed and pure EGaIn is investigated using three electrical resistance measurement techniques: four point probe, two point probe, and Wheatstone bridge. The results indicate substantial differences in measured electromechanical behavior between the three methods, which can largely be accounted for by correcting for a fixed offset corresponding to the resistances of various parts of the measurement circuits. Yet, even accounting for several of these sources of experimental error, the average relative change in resistance of EGaIn is found to be lower than that predicted by the commonly used bulk conductor assumption, referred to as Pouillet's law. Building upon recent theories proposed in the literature, possible explanations for the discrepancies are discussed. Finally, suggestions are provided on experimental design to enable reproducible and interpretable research.

         <title>Tuning the Magnetization of Manganese (II) Carbonate by Intracrystalline Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Incorporation of organic molecules into the lattice of inorganic crystalline hosts is a common phenomenon in biomineralization, and has been shown to alter various properties of the crystalline host. Taking this phenomenon as our source of inspiration, we show herein that incorporation of specific single amino acids into the lattice of manganese (II) carbonate strongly alters its inherent magnetic properties. At room temperature, the magnetic susceptibility of the amino&#8208;acid&#8208;incorporating paramagnetic MnCO3 decreases, following a simple rule of mixtures. When cooled below the N&#233;el temperature, however, the opposite trend is observed, namely an increase in magnetic susceptibility measured in a high magnetic field. Such an increase, accompanied by a drastic change in the N&#233;el phase transformation temperature, results from a decrease in MnCO3 orbital overlapping and the weakening of superexchange interactions. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the magnetic properties of a host crystal have been tuned via the incorporation of amino acids.

         <title>2D Ultrathin Nanopatterned Interlayer to Suppress Lithium Dendrite Growth in High&#8208;Energy Lithium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
We report a novel strategy for robust and ultrathin (&lt; 1 &#181;m) multi&#8208;layered protective structures to address uncontrolled Li dendrite growth at Li&#8208;metal battery anodes. Synergetic interaction among Ag nanoparticles (Ag NPs), reduced graphene oxide (rGO) films, and self&#8208;assembled block&#8208;copolymer (BCP) layers enables effective suppression of dendritic Li growth. While Ag NP layer confines the growth of Li metal underneath rGO layer, BCP layer facilitates the fast and uniformly distributed flux of Li&#8208;ion transport and mechanically supports the rGO layer. Notably, highly aligned nanochannels with &#8764;15&#160;nm diameter and &#8764;600&#160;nm length scale interpenetrating within BCP layer offer reversible well&#8208;defined pathways for Li&#8208;ion transport. Dramatic stress relaxation with the multilayered structure is confirmed via structural simulation considering the mechanical stress induced by filamentary&#8208;growth of Li metal. Li metal anodes modified with the protective layer well&#8208;maintain stable reaction interfaces with limited SEI formation, yielding outstanding cycling stability and enhanced rate capability, as demonstrated by the full&#8208;cells paired with high&#8208;loading of LiFePO4 cathodes. Our idealized design of multi&#8208;layer protective layer provides significant insight for advanced Li metal anodes.

Dramatic stress relaxation with the multilayered structure is confirmed via structural simulation considering the mechanical stress induced by filamentary-growth of Li metal. Li metal anodes modified with the protective layer well-maintain stable reaction interfaces with limited SEI formation, yielding outstanding cycling stability and enhanced rate capability, as demonstrated by the full-cells paired with high-loading of LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; cathodes. Our idealized design of multi-layer protective layer provides significant insight for advanced Li metal anodes.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Seawater Corrosion Resistant and Isotropic Zero Thermal Expansion (Zr, Ta)(Fe, Co)2 Alloy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Zero thermal expansion (ZTE) alloy as a dimensionally stable material is usually challenged by harsh environmental erosion, since ZTE and corrosion resistance are generally mutually exclusive. Here, we report a high&#8208;performance alloy, Zr0.8Ta0.2Fe1.7Co0.3, that shows (i) isotropic ZTE behavior (&#945;l = 0.21(2) &#215; 10&#8722;6 K&#8722;1) in a wide temperature range of 5 &#8211; 360 K, (ii) high corrosion resistance in the seawater&#8208;like solution compared with classic Invar and stainless Invar, and (iii) excellent cyclic thermal and structural stabilities. Such stabilities are attributed to the cubic symmetry, the controllable magnetic order, and the spontaneously formed passive film with Ta and Zr chemical modifications. The results are evidenced by X&#8208;ray/neutron diffractions, microscopy, spectroscopy, and electrochemistry investigations. Such multiple stabilities have the potential to broaden the robust applications of ZTE alloys, especially in marine services.

         <title>Convection Driven Ultra&#8208;Rapid Protein Detection Via Nanobody&#8208;Functionalized Organic Electrochemical Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Conventional biosensors rely on the diffusion&#8208;dominated transport of the target analyte to the sensor surface. Consequently, they require an incubation step that may take several hours to allow for the capture of analyte molecules by sensor biorecognition sites. This incubation step is a primary cause of long sample&#8208;to&#8208;result times. Here, we integrate alternating current electrothermal flow (ACET) in an organic electrochemical transistor (OECT)&#8208;based sensor to accelerate the device operation. The ACET is applied to the gate electrode functionalized with nanobody&#8208;SpyCatcher fusion proteins. Using the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) spike protein in human saliva as an example target, we show that ACET enables protein recognition within only 2 minutes of sample exposure, supporting its use in clinical practice. The ACET integrated sensor exhibits better selectivity, higher sensitivity, and lower limit of detection than the equivalent sensor with diffusion dominated operation. We compare the performance of ACET integrated sensors with two types of organic semiconductors in the channel and investigate grounds for device&#8208;to&#8208;device variations. Our results provide guidelines for the channel material choice in OECT based biochemical sensors, and demonstrate that ACET integration substantially decreases the detection speed while increasing the sensitivity and selectivity of transistor&#8208;based sensors.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Responsive Magnetoactive and Electro&#8208;Ionic Soft Actuator Derived from Nickel&#8208;based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
There is growing demand for multi&#8208;responsive soft actuators for the realization of natural, safe, and complex motions in robotic interactions. In particular, soft actuators simultaneously stimulated by electrical and magnetic fields have always been a under development owing to their simple controllability and reliability during operation. Herein, we report magnetically and electrically driven dual&#8208;responsive soft actuators (MESA) derived from novel nickel&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (Ni&#8208;MOFs&#8208;700C). Nanoscale Ni&#8208;MOFs&#8208;700C has excellent electrochemical and magnetic properties that allow it to be used as a multifunctional material under both magneto&#8208;active and electro&#8208;ionic actuations. The dual&#8208;responsive MESA exhibits a bending displacement of 30&#160;mm and an ultrafast rising time of 1.5 s under a very low input voltage of 1&#160;V, and also exerts a bending deflection of 12.5&#160;mm at 50 mT under a high excitation frequency of 5&#160;Hz. By utilizing a dual&#8208;responsive MESA, the hovering motion of a hummingbird robot was demonstrated under magnetic and electrical stimuli.

         <title>Organic Hole Transport Layers for Efficient, Stable and Scalable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hole transporting layers (HTLs) are an essential component in inverted, p&#8208;i&#8208;n perovskite solar cells (PSCs) where they play a decisive role in extraction and transport of holes, surface passivation, perovskite crystallization, device stability and cost. Currently, the exploration of efficient, stable, highly transparent and low&#8208;cost HTLs is of vital importance for propelling p&#8208;i&#8208;n PSCs toward commercialization. Compared to their inorganic counterparts, organic HTLs offer multiple advantages such as a tunable bandgap and energy levels, easy synthesis and purification, solution processability and overall low cost. In this review, recent progress of organic HTLs, including conductive polymers, small molecules and self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs), as utilized in inverted PSCs is systematically reviewed and summarized. Their molecular structure, hole transport properties, energy levels and relevant device properties and resulting performances are presented and analyzed. A summary of design principles and a future outlook towards highly efficient organic HTLs in inverted PSCs is proposed. This review aims to inspire further innovative development of novel organic HTLs for more efficient, stable, and scalable inverted PSCs.

         <title>Noncovalent Polymerization Activated Ultrastrong Near&#8208;Infrared Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Energy Transfer Assembly in Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Noncovalent macrocycle&#8208;confined supramolecular purely organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) is the current research hotspot. Herein, we report a high&#8208;efficiency noncovalent polymerization activated near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emissive RTP&#8208;harvesting system in aqueous solution based on the stepwise confinement of cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) and &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin grafted hyaluronic acid (HACD). Compared with dodecyl chain bridged 6&#8208;bromoisoquinoline derivative (G), the dumbbell&#8208;shaped assembly G&#8834;CB[7] presents an appeared complexation&#8208;induced RTP signal at 540&#160;nm via the first confinement of CB[7]. Subsequently, benefitting from the stepwise confinement encapsulation of &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin cavity, the subsequent noncovalent polymerization of the binary G&#8834;CB[7] assembly enabled by HACD can contribute to the further enhanced RTP emission intensity approximately 8 times in addition to an increased lifetime from 59.0 &#181;s to 0.581&#160;ms. Moreover, upon doping a small amount of two types of organic dyes, Nile blue (NiB) or Tetrakis(4&#8208;sulfophenyl)porphyrin (TPPSS) as an acceptor into the supramolecular confinement assembly G&#8834;CB[7]@HACD, efficient RTP energy transfer occurs accompanied by a long&#8208;lived NIR emitting performance (680, 710&#160;nm) with a high donor/acceptor ratio. Intriguingly, the prepared RTP&#8208;harvesting system is successfully applied for targeted NIR imaging of living tumor cells by utilizing the targeting ability of hyaluronic acid, which provides a new strategy to create advanced water&#8208;soluble NIR phosphorescent materials.

         <title>Instantaneous High&#8208;Resolution Visual Imaging of Latent Fingerprints in Water Using Color&#8208;Tunable AIE Pincer Complexes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Instant visualization of latent fingerprints was developed by using a series of water&#8208;soluble terpyridine zinc complexes as aggregation&#8208;induced emission probes in pure water, under UV light or ambient sunlight. By simply soaking, or spraying with an aqueous solution of the probe, bright yellow fluorescence images with high contrast and resolution were readily developed on various surfaces including tinfoil, glass, paper, steel, leather and ceramic tile. Remarkably, latent fingerprints can be visualized within seconds including details of whorl and sweat pores. The color of emission could be tuned from blue to orange by modifying the pincer ligands, allowing direct imaging under sunlight. These inexpensive, water&#8208;resistant, and color&#8208;tunable probes provide a practical approach for latent fingerprints recording and analysis, security protection, as well as criminal investigation in different scenarios.

         <title>Integrating SEI into Layered Conductive Polymer Coatings for Ultrastable Silicon Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A layered conductive polyaniline (LCP) coating is built from a bottom&#8208;up polymer design strategy for Si anodes. The in situ formation of LCP&#8208;integrated solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) with uniform structure and flexible mechanical property enhances the stability of the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface.








Abstract
Tackling the huge volume expansion of silicon (Si) anode desires a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) to prohibit the interfacial side reactions. Here, a layered conductive polyaniline (LCP) coating is built on Si nanoparticles to achieve high areal capacity and long lifespan. The conformal LCP coating stores electrolyte in interlamination spaces and directs an in situ formation of LCP&#8208;integrated hybrid SEI skin with uniform distribution of organic and inorganic components, enhancing the flexibility of the SEI to buffer the volume changes and maintaining homogeneous ion transport during cycling. As a result, the Si anode shows a remarkable cycling stability under high areal capacity (&#8776;3&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2) after 150 cycles and good rate performance of 942&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 5 A g&#8722;1. This work demonstrates the great potential of regulating the SEI properties by a layered polymer&#8208;directing SEI formation for the mechanical and electrochemical stabilization of Si anodes.

         <title>Rhombohedral Pd&#8211;Sb Nanoplates with Pd&#8208;Terminated Surface: An Efficient Bifunctional Fuel&#8208;Cell Catalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Pd&#8211;Sb hexagonal nanoplate of ordered rhombohedral Pd8Sb3 phase with a Pd&#8208;terminated surface is successfully prepared and applied as a high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalyst. The unique surface structure can effectively reduce the energy barrier of ethanol dehydrogenation in the ethanol oxidation reaction&#160;and suppress the competing two&#8208;electron pathway in the oxygen reduction reaction, leading to high&#8208;efficiency bifunctional electrocatalysis for energy conversion and beyond.








Abstract
Developing high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts for the ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is essential for the commercialization of direct ethanol fuel cells, but it is still formidably challenging. In this work, a novel Pd&#8211;Sb hexagonal nanoplate for boosting both cathodic and anodic fuel cell reactions is prepared. Detailed characterizations reveal that the nanoplates have ordered rhombohedral phase of Pd8Sb3 (denoted as Pd8Sb3 HPs). The Pd8Sb3 HPs exhibit&#160;much enhanced activity toward the oxidation of various alcohols. Particularly, Pd8Sb3 HPs/C displays superior specific and mass activities of 29.3&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and 4.5&#160;A&#160;mgPd&#8722;1 toward the EOR, which are 7.0 and 11.3 times higher than those of commercial Pd/C, and 9.8 and 3.8 times higher than those of commercial Pt/C, respectively, representing one of the best EOR catalysts reported to date. In situ electrochemical attenuated total reflectance surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;SEIRAS) measurements reveal that Pd8Sb3 HPs/C can effectively promote the C2 pathway of the EOR. As revealed by density functional theory calculations, the high EOR activity of the Pd8Sb3 HPs can be ascribed to the reduced energy barrier of ethanol dehydrogenation. Additionally, Pd8Sb3 HPs/C also shows superior performance in the&#160;ORR. This work advances the controllable synthesis of the Pd&#8211;Sb nanostructure, giving huge impetus for the design&#160;of high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalysts for energy conversion and beyond.

         <title>Atomic and Electronic Manipulation of Robust Ferroelectric Polymorphs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
True 2D ferroelectricity up to T&#160;= 400 K is achieved via atomic and electronic manipulation of polymorphs in Mo1&#8722;xWxTe2, developing an original phase diagram for ferroelectricity in atomically thin materials.








Abstract
Polymorphism allows the symmetry of the lattice and spatial charge distributions of atomically thin materials to be designed. While various polymorphs for superconducting, magnetic, and topological states have been extensively studied, polymorphic control is a challenge for robust ferroelectricity in atomically thin geometries. Here, the atomic and electric manipulation of ferroelectric polymorphs in Mo1&#8722;xWxTe2 is reported. Atomic manipulation for polymorphic control via chemical pressure (substituting tungsten for molybdenum atoms) and charge density modulation can realize tunable polar lattice structures and robust ferroelectricity up to T&#160;= 400 K with a constant coercive field in an atomically thin material. Owing to the effective inversion symmetry breaking, the ferroelectric switching withstands a charge carrier density of up to 1.1 &#215; 1013 cm&#8722;2, developing an original diagram for ferroelectric switching in atomically thin materials.

         <title>Recording Temperature with Magnetic Supraparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Temperature is one of the most important external influences for materials. In this work, the design, working principle, and tunability of temperature&#8208;indicator supraparticles are presented. These supraparticles can record and memorize thermal influences up to 170&#160;&#176;C with a spectral magnetic readout. The magnetic signals are independent of optical constraints and can thus be utilized to obtain information from within dark, solid objects.








Abstract
Small&#8208;sized temperature indicator additives autonomously record temperature events via a gradual irreversible signal change. This permits, for instance, the indication of possible cold&#8208;chain breaches or failure of electronics but also curing of glues. Thus, information about the materials&#8217; thermal history can be obtained upon signal detection at every point of interest. In this work, maximum&#8208;temperature indicators with magnetic readout based on micrometer&#8208;sized supraparticles (SPs) are introduced. The magnetic signal transduction is, by nature, independent of the materials&#8217; optical properties. This facilitates the determination of valuable temperature information from the inside, that is, the bulk, even of dark and opaque macroscopic objects, which might differ from their surface. Compared to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art optical temperature indicators, complementary magnetic readout characteristics ultimately expand their applicability. The conceptualized SPs are hierarchically structured assemblies of environmentally friendly, inexpensive iron oxide nanoparticles and thermoplastic polymer. Irreversible structural changes, induced by polymer softening, yield magnetic interaction changes within and between the hierarchic sub&#8208;structures, which are distinguishable and define the temperature indication mechanism. The fundamental understanding of the SPs&#8217; working principle enables customization of the particles&#8217; working range, response time, and sensitivity, using a toolbox&#8208;like manufacturing approach. The magnetic signal change is detected self&#8208;referenced, fast, and contactless.

In this work, maximum-temperature indicators with magnetic readout based on micrometer-sized supraparticles (SPs) are introduced. The magnetic signal transduction is, by nature, independent of the materials&#8217; optical properties. This facilitates the determination of valuable temperature information from the inside, that is, the bulk, even of dark and opaque macroscopic objects, which might differ from their surface. Compared to state-of-the-art optical temperature indicators, complementary magnetic readout characteristics ultimately expand their applicability. The conceptualized SPs are hierarchically structured assemblies of environmentally friendly, inexpensive iron oxide nanoparticles and thermoplastic polymer. Irreversible structural changes, induced by polymer softening, yield magnetic interaction changes within and between the hierarchic sub-structures, which are distinguishable and define the temperature indication mechanism. The fundamental understanding of the SPs&#8217; working principle enables customization of the particles&#8217; working range, response time, and sensitivity, using a toolbox-like manufacturing approach. The magnetic signal change is detected self-referenced, fast, and contactless.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Vapor Lubrication for Reducing Water and Ice Adhesion on Polydimethylsiloxane Brushes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Fast removal of small water drops from surfaces is a challenging issue in heat transfer, water collection or anti&#8208;icing. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) brushes show good prospects to reach this goal because of their low adhesion to liquids. To further reduce adhesion of water drops, here, we expose the surface to the vapor of organic solvents such as toluene or n&#8208;hexane. In the presence of such vapors, water drops slide at lower tilt angle and move faster. It is mainly caused by the physisorption of vapor and swelling of the PDMS brushes, which serves as a lubricating layer. Enhanced by the toluene vapor lubrication, the limit departure volume of water drop on PDMS brushes decreases by one order of magnitude compared to that in air. As a result, the water harvesting efficiency in toluene vapor increased by 65%. We further demonstrate benefits of vapor lubrication in drop manipulation and de&#8208;icing via the gravity of ice itself.

         <title>How to Change the Reaction Chemistry on Nonprecious Metal Oxide Nanostructure Materials for Electrocatalytic Oxidation of Biomass&#8208;Derived Glycerol to Renewable Chemicals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction kinetics and chemistry for the electrocatalytic glycerol oxidation reaction are investigated. Both experimental and computational methods are used to understand and reveal how and why the reaction kinetics and chemistry change with the electrochemically synthesized CuCo&#8208;oxide, Cu&#8208;oxide, and Co&#8208;oxide catalysts compared to conventional Au and Pt catalysts.








Abstract
Au and Pt are well&#8208;known catalysts for electrocatalytic oxidation of biomass&#8208;derived glycerol. Although some nonprecious&#8208;metal&#8208;based materials to replace the costly Au and Pt are used for this reaction, the fundamental question of how the nonprecious catalysts affect the reaction chemistry and mechanism compared to Au and Pt catalysts is still unanswered. In this work, both experimental and computational methods are used to understand how and why the reaction performance and chemistry for the electrocatalytic glycerol oxidation reaction (EGOR) change with electrochemically&#8208;synthesized CuCo&#8208;oxide, Cu&#8208;oxide, and Co&#8208;oxide catalysts compared to conventional Au and Pt catalysts. The Au and Pt catalysts generate major glyceric acid and glycolic acid products from the EGOR. Interestingly, the prepared Cu&#8208;based oxides produce glycolic acid and formic acid with high selectivity of about 90.0%. This different reaction chemistry is related to the enhanced ability of C&#63743;C bond cleavage on the Cu&#8208;based oxide materials. The density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the formic acids are mainly formed on the Cu&#8208;based oxide surfaces rather than in the process of glycolic acid formation in the free energy diagram. This study provides critical scientific insights into developing future nonprecious&#8208;based materials for electrochemical biomass conversions.

         <title>A Euryhaline&#8208;Fish&#8208;Inspired Salinity Self&#8208;Adaptive Nanofluidic Diode Leads to High&#8208;Performance Blue Energy Harvesters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sandwich&#8208;structured nanochannel system is constructed to realize salinity self&#8208;adaptive nanofluidic diodes, which lead to a high&#8208;performance salinity&#8208;gradient power generator with low internal resistance. Adaptive to changing salinity, the pore morphology of one side of the nanochannel system switches from a 1D straight nanochannel to 3D network pores, along with three orders of magnitude change for charge density.








Abstract
The adaptability to wide salinities remains a big challenge for artificial nanofluidic systems, which plays a vital role in water&#8211;energy nexus science. Here, inspired by euryhaline fish, sandwich&#8208;structured nanochannel systems are constructed to realize salinity self&#8208;adaptive nanofluidic diodes, which lead to high&#8208;performance salinity&#8208;gradient power generators with low internal resistance. Adaptive to changing salinity, the pore morphology of one side of the nanochannel system switches from a 1D straight nanochannel&#160;(45 nm) to 3D network pores (1.9 nm pore size and &#8776;1013 pore density), along with three orders of magnitude change for charge density. Thus, the abundant surface charges and narrow pores render the membrane&#8208;based osmotic power generator with power density up to 26.22 Wm&#8722;2. The salinity&#8208;adaptive membrane solves the surface charge&#8208;shielding problem caused by abundant mobile ions in high salinity and increases the overlapping degree of the electric double layer. The dynamic adaption process of the membrane to the hypersaline environment endows it with good salt endurance and stability. New routes for designing nanofluidic devices functionally adaptable to different salinities and building power generators with excellent salt endurance are demonstrated.

         <title>Kirigami Inspired Pressure Sensors for Wearable Dynamic Cardiovascular Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Continuously and accurately monitoring the pulse wave signals is critical to prevent and diagnose cardiovascular diseases. However, existing wearable pulse sensors are vulnerable to motion artifacts due to the lack of proper adhesion and conformal interface with human skin during body movement. Here, a highly sensitive and conformal pressure sensor inspired by the kirigami structure was developed to measure the human pulse wave on different body artery sites under various prestressing pressure conditions and even with body movement. COMSOL multi&#8208;physical field coupling simulation and experimental testing were used to verify the unique advantages of the kirigami structure. The device shows a superior sensitivity (35.2&#160;mV/Pa) and remarkable stability (&gt;84,000 cycles). Towards practical applications, a wireless cardiovascular monitoring system is developed for wirelessly transmitting the pulse signals to a mobile phone in real&#8208;time, which successfully distinguished the pulse waveforms from different participants. The pulse waveforms measured by the kirigami inspired pressure sensor are as accurate as those provided by the commercial medical device. Given the compelling features, the sensor provides an ascendant way for wearable electronics to overcome motion artifacts when monitoring pulse signals, thus representing a solid advancement towards personalized healthcare in the era of the Internet of Things.

         <title>Efficient low&#8208;grade heat conversion and storage with an activity&#8208;regulated redox flow cell via thermally regenerative electrochemical cycle</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Efficient and cost&#8208;effective technologies are highly desired to convert the tremendous amount of low&#8208;grade waste heat to electricity. Although thermally regenerative electrochemical cycle (TREC) has attracted increasing attention recently, the unsatisfactory thermal&#8208;to&#8208;electrical conversion efficiency and low power density limit its practical applications. In this work, we demonstrate a thermosensitive Nernstian&#8208;potential&#8208;driven strategy in TREC system to boost its temperature coefficient, power density and thermoelectric conversion efficiency by rationally regulating the activities of redox couples at different temperatures. With Zn anode and [Fe(CN)6]4&#8208;/3&#8211;&#8208;guanidinium as catholyte, the TREC flow cell presents an unprecedented average temperature coefficient of &#8208;3.28&#160;mV/K, and has achieved an absolute thermoelectric efficiency of 25.1% and apparent thermoelectric efficiency of 14.9% relative to Carnot efficiency at the temperature range of 25&#8211;50&#160;&#176;C at 1&#160;mA/cm2. In addition, a thermoelectric power density of 1.98&#160;mW/(m2 K2) has been demonstrated, which is more than 7 times the highest power density of reported TREC systems. This activity regulation strategy could inspire research into high&#8208;efficiency and high&#8208;power TREC devices for practical low&#8208;grade heat harnessing.

         <title>Fast Near&#8208;Infrared Photodetection using III&#8208;V Colloidal Quantum Dots</title>

Abstract
Colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are promising materials for IR light detection due to their tunable bandgap and their solution processing; however, to date, the time response of CQD IR photodiodes has been inferior to that provided by Si and InGaAs. We reasoned that the high permittivity of II&#8208;VI CQDs leads to slow charge extraction due to screening and capacitance; whereas III&#8208;Vs &#8211; if their surface chemistry could be mastered &#8211; offer a low permittivity and thus increased potential for high&#8208;speed operation. In initial studies, we found that the covalent character in InAs leads to imbalanced charge transport, the result of unpassivated surfaces and uncontrolled heavy doping. We report surface management using amphoteric ligand coordination and find that the approach addresses simultaneously the In and As surface dangling bonds. The new InAs CQD solids combine high mobility (0.04 cm2 V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1) with a 4x reduction in permittivity compared to PbS CQDs. The resulting photodiodes achieve a response time faster than 2&#160;ns &#8211; the fastest photodiode among previously&#8208;reported CQD photodiodes &#8211; combined with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 30% at 940&#160;nm.

         <title>Theory&#8208;Driven Design of Cationic Accelerator for High&#8208;Performance Electrolytic MnO2&#8208;Zn Batteries</title>

Abstract
Aqueous electrolytic MnO2&#8208;Zn batteries are considered as one of the most promising energy storage devices for their cost effectiveness, high output voltage and safety, but their electrochemical performance is limited by the sluggish electrolysis kinetics of cathode MnO2/Mn2+ and anode Zn/Zn2+ reactions. To overcome this critical challenge, herein a cationic accelerator (CA) strategy is proposed based on the prediction of first&#8208;principles calculations. We utilize polyvinylpyrrolidone as a model CA to testify the rational design of the CA strategy. It manifests that the CA effectively facilitates rapid cations migration in electrolyte and adequate charge transfer at electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface, benefiting the deposition/dissolution processes of both Mn2+ and Zn2+ cations to simultaneously improve kinetics of cathodic MnO2/Mn2+ and anodic Zn/Zn2+ reactions and thereby enabling high&#8208;performance MnO2&#8208;Zn batteries. The resulting MnO2&#8208;Zn battery regulated by CA exhibits large reversible capacities of 455 mAh g&#8211;1 and 3.64 mAh cm&#8211;2 at 20 C with energy density retention of 90%, a high discharge voltage of 1.95&#160;V at 1 C, as well as a long lifespan of 2000 cycles, achieving one of the best overall performances in the electrolytic MnO2&#8208;Zn batteries. Our comprehensive work integrating theoretical prediction with experimental studies provides opportunities to the development of high&#8208;performance energy storage devices.

         <title>Supercritical relaxor nanograined ferroelectrics for ultrahigh energy&#8208;storage capacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Supercritical relaxor nanograined ferroelectrics are demonstrated for high&#8208;performance dielectric capacitors, showing record&#8208;high overall properties of energy density &#8764;13.1 J cm&#8211;3 and field&#8208;insensitive efficiency &#8764;90% at &#8764;74&#160;kV mm&#8211;1 and superior charge&#8208;discharge performances of high power density &#8764;700 MW cm&#8211;3, high discharge energy density &#8764;6.67 J cm&#8211;3 and ultra&#8208;short discharge time &lt;40&#160;ns at 55&#160;kV mm&#8211;1. Ex&#8208;/In&#8208;situ transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction provide clear evidence of the supercritical behavior in (Na,K)(Sb,Nb)O3&#8208;SrZrO3&#8208;(Bi0.5Na0.5)ZrO3 ceramics, being achieved by engineering the coexistence of multiple local symmetries within the ergodic relaxor zone. The vanished difference between the ground relaxor state and the high&#8208;field supercritical state eliminates the polarization hysteresis. The supercritical evolution with electric field enables a highly&#8208;delayed polarization saturation with continuously&#8208;increased polarization magnitudes. The results demonstrate that such a design strategy of compositionally&#8208;induced and field&#8208;manipulated supercritical behavior can be generalizable for developing desirable energy&#8208;storage dielectrics for applications in ceramic/film capacitors.

         <title>All&#8208;Aqueous Freeform Fabrication of Perfusable Self&#8208;Standing Soft Compartments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward method based on the interfacial complexation of oppositely charged natural polyelectrolytes is proposed to directly fabricate fiber&#8208;shaped structures, stable in all&#8208;aqueous physiological&#8208;relevant conditions. Perfusable and size&#8208;controllable materials can be obtained, with adequate permeability and improved biofunctionality, enabling cell adhesion and growth. Outside the separating interface of two&#8208;phase systems, self&#8208;standing entities can be easily handled, broadening the range of applications.








Abstract
Compartmentalized structures obtained in all&#8208;aqueous settings have shown promising properties as cell encapsulation devices, as well as reactors for trans&#8208;membrane chemical reactions. While most approaches focus on the preparation of spherical devices, advances on the production of complex architectures have been enabled by the interfacial stability conferred by emulsion systems, namely mild aqueous two&#8208;phase systems (ATPS), or non&#8208;equilibrated analogues. However, the application of non&#8208;spherical structures has mostly been reported while keeping the fabricated materials at a stable interface, limiting the free&#8208;standing character, mobility and transposition of the obtained structures to different setups. Here, the fabrication of self&#8208;standing, malleable and perfusable tubular systems through all&#8208;aqueous interfacial assembly is shown, culminating in the preparation of independent objects with stability and homogeneity after disruption of the polymer&#8208;based aqueous separating system. Those hollow structures can be fabricated with a variety of widths, and rapidly printed as long structures at flow rates of 15&#160;mm s&#8722;1. The materials are used as compartments for cell culture, showcasing high cytocompatibility, and can be tailored to promote cell adhesion. Such structures may find application in fields that benefit from freeform tubular structures, including the biomedical field with, for example, cell encapsulation, and benchtop preparation of microfluidic devices.

         <title>Synergistic Crystallization and Passivation by A Single Molecular Additive for High Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
With its power conversion efficiency surpassed those of all other thin film solar cells only a few years after its invention, the perovskite solar cell has become a superstar. Controlling intermediate phase of crystallization is a key to obtain high&#8208;quality perovskite films. Herein, a single molecule additive, N, N&#8208;Dimethylimidodicarbonimidic diamide hydroiodide (DIAI), is incorporated into perovskite precursor to eliminate the influence of intermediate phases. By taking advantage of interaction of DIAI and DMSO, the intermediate phase FAI&#8208;PbI2&#8208;DMSO complex is eliminated, and &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3 is entirely converted to desired &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 during the crystallization step, resulting in enlarged grain size and im proved crystalline quality. This is the first observation in solution method that FAPbI3 can be obtained without intermediate phase for high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells. Furthermore, DIAI is effective at passivating surface defects, resulting in reduced defect density, increased carrier lifetime, and improved device efficiency and stability. The champion device achieved an efficiency of 24.13%. Furthermore, the bare device without any encapsulation maintains 94.1% of its initial efficiency after ambient exposure over 1000 hours. This work contributes a strategy of synergistic crystallization and passivation to directly form &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 from the precursor solution without the influence of intermediate impurities for high performance perovskite applications.

By taking advantage of interaction of DIAI and DMSO, the intermediate phase FAI-PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-DMSO complex is eliminated, and &lt;i&gt;&#948;&lt;/i&gt;-FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is entirely converted to desired &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; during the crystallization step, resulting in enlarged grain size and im proved crystalline quality. This is the first observation in solution method that FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; can be obtained without intermediate phase for high-performance perovskite solar cells. Furthermore, DIAI is effective at passivating surface defects, resulting in reduced defect density, increased carrier lifetime, and improved device efficiency and stability. The champion device achieved an efficiency of 24.13%. Furthermore, the bare device without any encapsulation maintains 94.1% of its initial efficiency after ambient exposure over 1000 hours. This work contributes a strategy of synergistic crystallization and passivation to directly form &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; from the precursor solution without the influence of intermediate impurities for high performance perovskite applications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Versatile Sequential Casting Processing for Highly Efficient and Stable Binary Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Forming an ideal bulk heterojunction (BHJ) morphology is a critical issue governing the photon to electron process in organic solar cells (OSCs). Complementary to the widely&#8208;used blend casting (BC) method for BHJ construction, the sequential casting (SC) can also enable similar or even better morphology and device performance for OSCs. Here we utilize BC and SC methods on three representative donor:acceptor (D:A) blends, i.e., PM6:PC71BM, PM6:IT&#8208;4F and PM6:L8&#8208;BO. We achieve higher power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in all cases by taking advantage of beneficial morphology from SC processing, and a champion PCE of 18.86% (certified as 18.44%) based on PM6:L8&#8208;BO blend is reached, representing the record value among binary OSCs. The observations on phase separation and vertical distribution inspire the proposal of the swelling&#8208;intercalation phase&#8208;separation model to interpret the morphology evolution during the SC processing. Further, we find the vertical phase segregation delivers the improvement of device performance via affecting the charge transport and collection processes, as evidenced by the D:A ratio dependent photovoltaic properties. Besides, OSCs based on SC processing show advantages on device photostability and up&#8208;scale fabrication. This work demonstrates the versatility and efficacy of SC method for BHJ&#8208;based OSCs.

         <title>Electrical Sensing of the Thermal and Light Induced Spin Transition in Robust Contactless Spin&#8208;crossover/Graphene Hybrid Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Hybrid devices based on spin&#8208;crossover (SCO)/2D heterostructures grant a highly sensitive platform to detect the spin transition in the molecular SCO component and tune the properties of the 2D material. However, the fragility of the SCO materials upon thermal treatment, light irradiation or contact with surfaces and the methodologies used for their processing have limited their applicability. Here, we report an easily processable and robust SCO/2D hybrid device with outstanding performance based on the sublimable SCO [Fe(Pyrz)2] molecule deposited over CVD&#8208;graphene, which is fully compatible with electronics industry protocols. Thus, a novel methodology based on growing an elusive polymorph of [Fe(Pyrz)2] (tetragonal phase) over graphene is developed that allows us to electrically detect a fast and effective light&#8208;induced spin transition in the devices (&#8764;50% yield in 5 minutes). Such performance can be enhanced even more when a flexible polymeric layer of PMMA is inserted in between the two active components in a contactless configuration, reaching a &#8764;100% yield in 5 minutes.

         <title>Material Design and Device Fabrication Strategies for Stretchable Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive overview of fully stretchable organic solar cells (f&#8208;SOSCs), including essential studies to make each layer of an f&#8208;SOSC stretchable and efficient is provided. Various strategies to simultaneously enhance the photovoltaic and mechanical properties of the active layer, ranging from material design to fabrication control, are emphasized.








Abstract
Recent advances in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs) have greatly enhanced their commercial viability. Considering the technical standards (e.g., mechanical robustness) required for wearable electronics, which are promising application platforms for OSCs, the development of fully stretchable OSCs (f&#8208;SOSCs) should be accelerated. Here, a comprehensive overview of f&#8208;SOSCs, which are aimed to reliably operate under various forms of mechanical stress, including bending and multidirectional stretching, is provided. First, the mechanical requirements of f&#8208;SOSCs, in terms of tensile and cohesion/adhesion properties, are summarized along with the experimental methods to evaluate those properties. Second, essential studies to make each layer of f&#8208;SOSCs stretchable and efficient are discussed, emphasizing strategies to simultaneously enhance the photovoltaic and mechanical properties of the active layer, ranging from material design to fabrication control. Key improvements to the other components/layers (i.e., substrate, electrodes, and interlayers) are also covered. Lastly, considering that f&#8208;SOSC research is in its infancy, the current challenges and future prospects are explored.

Abstract
Challenges remain in the development of novel multifunctional electrocatalysts and their industrial operation on low&#8208;electricity pair&#8208;electrocatalysis platforms for carbon cycle. Herein, we&#160;design and develop an enzyme&#8208;inspired single&#8208;molecular heterojunction electrocatalyst ((NHx)16&#8208;NiPc/CNTs) with specific atomic nickel centers and amino&#8208;rich local microenvironments for industrial&#8208;level electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) and further energy&#8208;saving integrated CO2 electrolysis. Verily, (NHx)16&#8208;NiPc/CNTs exhibits unprecedented catalytic performance with industry&#8208;compatible current densities, &#8764;100% Faradaic efficiency and remarkable stability for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion, outperforming most reported catalysts. In addition to the enhanced CO2 capture by chemisorption, sturdy deuterium kinetic isotope effect and proton inventory studies sufficiently decipher that such distinctive local microenvironments provide an effective proton ferry effect for improving local alkalinity and proton transfer and creating local interactions to stabilize the intermediate, ultimately enabling the high&#8208;efficiency operation of eCO2RR. Further, by using (NHx)16&#8208;NiPc/CNTs as a bifunctional electrocatalyst in a flow cell, a low&#8208;electricity overall CO2 electrolysis system coupling cathodic eCO2RR with anodic oxidation reaction is developed to achieve concurrent feed gas production and sulfur recovery, simultaneously decreasing the energy input. This work paves the new way in exploring molecular electrocatalysts and electrolysis systems with techno&#8208;economic feasibility.

         <title>Revealing the Structural Coloration of Self&#8208;Assembled Chitin Nanocrystal Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chitin nanocrystals can be sustainably extracted from mushrooms and shrimp shells. These elongated nanoparticles spontaneously organize in water to form a chiral nematic mesophase. Upon evaporation, this helicoidal architecture is preserved, resulting in structurally colored films. An alkaline post&#8208;treatment to convert chitin into chitosan is found to significantly enhance the birefringence, resulting in vibrant red, green, and blue coloration.








Abstract
The structural coloration of arthropods often arises from helicoidal structures made primarily of chitin. Although it is possible to achieve analogous helicoidal architectures by exploiting the self&#8208;assembly of chitin nanocrystals (ChNCs), to date no evidence of structural coloration has been reported from such structures. Previous studies are identified to have been constrained by both the experimental inability to access sub&#8208;micrometer helicoidal pitches and the intrinsically low birefringence of crystalline chitin. To expand the range of accessible pitches, here, ChNCs are isolated from two phylogenetically distinct sources of &#945;&#8208;chitin, namely fungi and shrimp, while to increase the birefringence, an in situ alkaline treatment is performed, increasing the intensity of the reflected color by nearly two orders of magnitude. By combining this treatment with precise control over ChNC suspension formulation, structurally colored chitin&#8208;based films are demonstrated with reflection tunable from blue to near infrared.

To expand the range of accessible pitches, here, ChNCs are isolated from two phylogenetically distinct sources of &#945;-chitin, namely fungi and shrimp, while to increase the birefringence, an in situ alkaline treatment is performed, increasing the intensity of the reflected color by nearly two orders of magnitude. By combining this treatment with precise control over ChNC suspension formulation, structurally colored chitin-based films are demonstrated with reflection tunable from blue to near infrared.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
An ultrastable and kinetically favorable interface is constructed between sulfide&#8208;poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) composite solid electrolytes (CSE) and lithium metal, via in&#8208;situ formation of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer containing Li3PS4. A specially&#8208;designed sulfide, lithium polysulfidophosphate (LPS) can distribute uniformly in PEO matrix via simple stirring process because of its complete solubility in acetonitrile solvent, which is advantageous for creating a homogenous SEI layer. The CSE/Li interface with high Li+ transportation capability is stabilized quickly through in&#8208;situ formation of Li3PS4/Li2S/LiF layer via the reaction between LPS and lithium metal to inhibit lithium dendrite growth. Li/Li symmetric cell with the LPS&#8208;integrated CSE exhibits constant and small CSE/Li resistance of 10 &#937; cm2 during cycling, delivering stable cycling for 3475 h at a current density of 0.2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a high critical current density of 0.9&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 60&#160;&#176;C. Impressive electrochemical performance is also demonstrated for LiFePO4/CSE/Li all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries with capacity of 127.6 mAh g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles at 1 C.

         <title>Structure and Evolution of Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Hybrid Electrolytes Formed Inside Electrochemical Cells</title>

Abstract
Solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) formed inside an electrochemical cell by Lewis Acid salt&#8208;initiated polymerization of a liquid precursor provide a promising strategy for overcoming problems with electrolyte wetting and access to active electrode components in solid&#8208;state batteries. Hybrid solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes (HSPEs) created by in&#8208;situ polymerization of a conventional liquid precursor containing electrochemically inert nanostructures that are well&#8208;dispersed in the SSE are of particular interest because they offer a mechanism for selectively reinforcing or adding functionality to the electrolyte in all components of an electrochemical cell &#8212; removing the need for high degrees of polymerization and long formation times to achieve desirable electrolyte properties. We report on the synthesis, structure, chemical kinetics, and electrochemical characteristics of HSPEs created by Al(OTf)3&#8208;initiated polymerization of 1,3&#8208;dioxolane (DOL) containing hairy, nano&#8208;sized SiO2 particles. Small&#8208;angle x&#8208;ray scattering analysis reveals the particles are well&#8208;dispersed in DOL. Polymerization kinetics are observed through time&#8208;dependent mechanical property measurements, which reveal altered macrokinetics of ring&#8208;opening reaction upon addition of hairy nanoparticles (HNPs). Strong interaction between poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) molecules tethered to the SiO2 particles and poly(DOL) lead to co&#8208;crystallization &#8212;anchoring the nanoparticles in their host. It also enables polymerization&#8208;depolymerization processes in DOL to be studied and controlled. To demonstrate the utility of the in&#8208;situ formed HSPE, we first create Li|HSPE|Cu electrochemical half cells in which the HSPE is formed by ring&#8208;opening polymerization of DOL in the presence of HNPs, LiNO3, and LiTFSI. These cells manifest Coulombic efficiencies (CE) values approaching 99% and stable long&#8208;term cycling. As a final proof of concept, we create solid&#8208;state Lithium&#8208;Sulfur full&#8208;cell batteries, which utilize a sulfur&#8208;polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) composite material as cathode. The in&#8208;situ formed Li|HSPE|SPAN cells show good cycling stability and thus provide a promising path towards all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries created by in&#8208;situ formation of mechanically strong SPEs.

         <title>Manipulating Hierarchical Orientation of Wet&#8208;spun Hybrid Fiber Via Rheological Engineering for Zn&#8208;ion Fiber Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Wet&#8208;spinning is a promising strategy to fabricate fiber electrodes for real commercial fiber battery application, according to its great compatibility with large&#8208;scale fiber production. However, engineering the rheological properties of the electrochemical active materials to accommodate the viscoelasticity or liquid crystalline requirements for continuous wet&#8208;spinning remains a daunting challenge. Here, with entropy driven volume exclusion effects, we regulate the rheological behavior of vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) nanowire dispersions through introducing 2D graphene oxide (GO) flakes in an optimal ratio. By optimizing viscoelasticity and liquid crystalline behavior of spinning dope, the wet&#8208;spun hybrid fibers display controlled hierarchical orientation. The wet&#8208;spun V2O5/rGO hybrid fiber with the optimal 10:1 mass fraction (V2O5/rGO10:1) exhibits a highly oriented nano&#8208;block arrangement, which enabling efficient Zn&#8208;ion migration and an excellent Zn&#8208;ion storage capacity of 486.03 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1. A half&#8208;meter long quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state fiber Zn&#8208;ion battery has been assembled with a polyacrylamide (PAM) gel electrolyte and biocompatible Eco&#8208;flex encapsulation. The thus&#8208;derived fiber Zn&#8208;ion battery has been integrated into a wearable self&#8208;powered system, incorporating with a highly efficient GaAs solar cell, which delivers a record&#8208;high overall efficiency (9.80%) for flexible solar charging systems.

         <title>W Single&#8208;atom Catalyst for CH4 Photooxidation in Water Vapor</title>

         <dc:description>
Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven high&#8208;efficiency and direct conversion of methane into high value&#8208;added liquid oxygenates against overoxidation remains a great challenge. Herein, facile and mass fabrication of low&#8208;cost tungsten single atom photocatalysts was achieved by directly calcining urea and sodium tungstate under atmosphere (W&#8208;SA&#8208;PCN&#8208;m, urea amount m = 7.5, 15, 30 and 150&#160;g). The single atom photocatalysts can manage H2O2 in situ generation and decomposition into &#183;OH, thus achieving highly efficient CH4 photooxidation in water vapor under mild conditions. Systematic investigations demonstrate that integration of multifunctions of methane activation, H2O2 generation and decomposition into one photocatalyst can dramatically promote methane conversion to C1 oxygenates with a yield as high as 4956 &#956;mol&#183;gcat&#8211;1, superior to that of the most reported non&#8208;precious photocatalysts. Liquid&#8208;solid phase transition can induce the products facile switch from HCOOH to CH3OH by pulling the catalyst above water with CH3OH/HCOOH ratio from 10% (in H2O) to 80% (above H2O).

         <title>Identifying the Correlation Between Structural Parameters and Anisotropic Magnetic Properties in I&#8208;Mn&#8208;V Semiconductors: A Possible Room&#8208;Temperature Magnetism</title>

Abstract
Layer&#8208;structured materials are of central importance in a wide range of research fields owing to their unique properties originating from their two&#8208;dimensionality and anisotropy. Herein, we investigate quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional (2D) layer&#8208;structured I&#8208;Mn&#8208;V (I: alkali metals and V: pnictogen elements) compounds, which are potential antiferromagnetic (AFM) semiconductors.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Layer-structured materials are of central importance in a wide range of research fields owing to their unique properties originating from their two-dimensionality and anisotropy. Herein, we investigate quasi-two-dimensional (2D) layer-structured I-Mn-V (I: alkali metals and V: pnictogen elements) compounds, which are potential antiferromagnetic (AFM) semiconductors. We have successfully grown single crystals of I-Mn-V compounds using the self-flux method and analyzed their electronic and magnetic properties in correlation with structural parameters. Combined with theoretical calculations, the structural analysis indicated that the variation in the bonding angle between V&#8722;Mn&#8722;V is responsible for the change in the orbital hybridization of Mn and V, predominantly affecting their anisotropic semiconducting properties. We also found anisotropy in the magnetic properties, where AFM ordering is expected to occur in the in-plane direction, as supported by spin-structure calculations. Furthermore, a possible ferromagnetic (FM) transition is discussed in relation to the vacancy defects. This study provides a candidate material group for AFM and FM spintronics and a basis for exploring magnetic semiconductors in quasi-2D layer-structured systems.&lt;/p&gt;

Abstract
Cu3(HHTT)2 (HHTT: 2,3,7,8,12,13&#8208;hexahydroxytetraazanaphthotetraphene) is a novel two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8208;organic framework (2D c&#8208;MOF) with efficient in&#8208;plane d&#8208;&#960; conjugations and strong interlayer &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions while the growth of Cu3(HHTT)2 thin films has never been reported until now. Here, we present the successful fabrication of highly oriented wafer&#8208;scale Cu3(HHTT)2 thin films with a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer growth method on various substrates. Its semiconducting behavior and carrier transport mechanisms are clarified through temperature and frequency dependent conductivity measurements. Flexible photodetectors based on Cu3(HHTT)2 thin films exhibit reliable photo&#8208;responses at room temperature in a wavelength region from ultraviolet (UV) to mid&#8208;infrared (MIR), which is much broader than those of solution&#8208;processed broadband photodetectors reported previously. Moreover, the photodetectors can show a typical synaptic behavior and excellent data recognition accuracy in artificial neural networks. This work opens a window for the exploration of high&#8208;performance and multi&#8208;functional optoelectronic devices based on 2D c&#8208;MOFs.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Regulated Electrostatic Shielding Layer toward Dendrite&#8208;Free Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Although aqueous Zn batteries have become a more sustainable alternative to lithium&#8208;ion batteries owing to their intrinsic security, their practical applications are limited by dendrite formation and hydrogen reactions. We present the first application of a rare earth metal type addition to Zn batteries, cerium chloride (CeCl3), as an effective, low&#8208;cost, and green electrolyte additive that facilitates the formation of dynamic electrostatic shielding layer around the Zn protuberance to induce the uniform Zn deposition. After introducing CeCl3 additives, the electrochemical characterizations, in&#8208;situ optical microscopy observation, in&#8208;situ differential electrochemical mass spectrometry, along with density functional theory calculations and finite element method simulations reveal resisted Zn dendritic growth and enhanced electrolyte stability. As a result, the Zn&#8208;Zn cells using CeCl3 additive exhibit a long cycling stability of 2600 h at 2&#160;mA cm&#8211;2, an impressive cumulative areal capacity of 3.6 Ah cm&#8211;2 at 40&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 and a high coulombic efficiency of &#8764;99.7%. The fact that the Zn&#8208;LiFePO4 cells with proposed electrolyte retain capacity significantly better than the additive&#8208;free case is even more exciting.

         <title>Reversible Deformation of Artificial Cell Colony Triggered by Actin Polymerization for Muscle Behavior Mimicry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The use of artificial cells to mimic living tissues is beneficial for understanding the mechanism of interaction among cells. Artificial cells hold immense potential in the field of tissue engineering. Self&#8208;powered artificial cells capable of reversible deformation were developed by encapsulating living mitochondria, actin proteins, and methylcellulose. Upon addition of pyruvate molecules, the mitochondria produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) that acts as an energy source to trigger actin polymerization. The reversible deformation of artificial cells occurs with a spindle shape resulting from the polymerization of actins to form filaments adjacent to the lipid bilayer that subsequently returns to spherical shape resulting from the depolymerization of actin filaments upon laser irradiation. The linear colonies composed of these artificial cells exhibit collective contraction and relaxation to mimic muscle tissues. At maximum contraction, the long axis of each giant unilamellar vesicle (GUV) is parallel to each other. All colonies are synchronized in the contraction phase. The deformation of each GUV in the colonies is influenced by its adjacent GUVs. The muscle&#8208;like artificial cell colonies described here have paved the way to develop sustainably self&#8208;powered artificial tissues.

         <title>Highly Selective Adsorption of Perfluorinated Greenhouse Gases by Porous Organic Cages</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of porous organic cages with alkyl&#8208;, fluoroalkyl&#8208;, and partially fluorinated alkyl groups is presented and the structure&#8211;property relationships between the nature of the side&#8208;chains and the gas sorption behavior toward highly potent greenhouse gases, namely, perfluorocarbons (PFCs) are studied. By this approach, one compound having superior selectivities of PFCs versus N2 or CO2 under ambient conditions is identified.








Abstract
Anthropogenic greenhouse gases contribute to global warming. Among those gases, perfluorocarbons (PFCs) are thousands to tens of thousands of times more harmful to the environment than comparable amounts of carbon dioxide. To date, materials that selectively adsorb perfluorocarbons in favor of other less harmful gases have not been reported. Here, a series of porous organic cage compounds with alkyl&#8208;, fluoroalkyl&#8208;, and partially fluorinated alkyl groups is presented. Their isomorphic crystalline states allow the study of the structure&#8211;property relationship between the degree of fluorination of the alkyl chains and the gas sorption properties for PFCs and their selective uptakes in comparison to other, nonfluorinated gases. By this approach, one compound having superior selectivities of PFCs versus N2 or CO2 under ambient conditions is identified.

         <title>Designing Rewritable Dual&#8208;Mode Patterns using a Stretchable Photoresponsive Polymer via Orthogonal Photopatterning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two patterns are observed in one film! Orthogonal photopatterning is developed to fabricate dual&#8208;mode patterns in stretchable azopolymers that exhibit photoinduced reversible solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid transitions. The dual&#8208;mode pattern contains photonic and chromatic polarization patterns, which do not interfere with each other. The dual&#8208;mode patterns are rewritable and reprocessable. They are promising materials for anti&#8208;counterfeiting, information storage, and encryption applications.








Abstract
The fabrication of dual&#8208;mode patterns in the same region of a material is a promising approach for high&#8208;density information storage, new anti&#8208;counterfeiting technologies, and highly secure encryption. However, dual&#8208;mode patterns are difficult to achieve because the two patterns in one material may interfere with each other during fabrication and usage. The development of noninterfering dual&#8208;mode patterns requires new materials and patterning techniques. Herein, a novel orthogonal photopatterning technique is reported for the fabrication of noninterfering dual&#8208;mode patterns on an azopolymer P1. P1 is a unique material that exhibits both photoinduced reversible solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid transitions and good stretchability. In the first step of orthogonal photopatterning, patterned photonic structures are fabricated on a P1 film via masked nanoimprinting controlled by photoinduced reversible solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid transitions. In the second step, the P1 film is stretched and irradiated with polarized light through a photomask, which generates a chromatic polarization pattern. In particular, the photonic structures and chromatic polarization in the dual&#8208;mode pattern are noninterfering. Another feature of dual&#8208;mode patterns is that they are rewritable via photo&#8208;, thermal, or solution reprocessing, which are useful for recycling and reprogramming. This study opens an avenue for the development of novel materials and techniques for photopatterning.

&lt;p&gt;The fabrication of dual-mode patterns in the same region of a material is a promising approach for high-density information storage, new anti-counterfeiting technologies, and highly secure encryption. However, dual-mode patterns are difficult to achieve because the two patterns in one material may interfere with each other during fabrication and usage. The development of noninterfering dual-mode patterns requires new materials and patterning techniques. Herein, a novel orthogonal photopatterning technique is reported for the fabrication of noninterfering dual-mode patterns on an azopolymer P1. P1 is a unique material that exhibits both photoinduced reversible solid-to-liquid transitions and good stretchability. In the first step of orthogonal photopatterning, patterned photonic structures are fabricated on a P1 film via masked nanoimprinting controlled by photoinduced reversible solid-to-liquid transitions. In the second step, the P1 film is stretched and irradiated with polarized light through a photomask, which generates a chromatic polarization pattern. In particular, the photonic structures and chromatic polarization in the dual-mode pattern are noninterfering. Another feature of dual-mode patterns is that they are rewritable via photo-, thermal, or solution reprocessing, which are useful for recycling and reprogramming. This study opens an avenue for the development of novel materials and techniques for photopatterning.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stable and Bright Electroluminescent Devices utilizing Emissive 0D Perovskite Nanocrystals Incorporated in a 3D CsPbBr3 Matrix</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly luminescent 0D Cs4PbBr6 nanocrystals are incorporated into 3D CsPbBr3 films&#160;to form single&#8208;layer perovskite light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells. The 0D Cs4PbBr6 nanocrystals improve the maximum luminance to 11&#8239;200&#160;cd m&#8722;2, the power efficiency to 33.0 Lm W&#8722;1, the external quantum efficiency to 8.3%, and the operational stability to 129 h at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
The 0D cesium lead halide perovskite Cs4PbBr6 has drawn remarkable interest due to its highly efficient robust green emission compared to its 3D CsPbBr3 counterpart. However, seizing the advantages of the superior photoluminescence properties for practical light&#8208;emitting devices remains elusive. To date, Cs4PbBr6 has been employed only as a higher&#8208;bandgap nonluminescent matrix to passivate or provide quantum/dielectric confinement to CsPbBr3 in light&#8208;emitting devices and to enhance its photo&#8208;/thermal/environmental stability. To resolve this disparity, a novel solvent engineering method to incorporate highly luminescent 0D Cs4PbBr6 nanocrystals (perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs)) into a 3D CsPbBr3 film, forming the active emissive layer in single&#8208;layer perovskite light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (PeLECs) is designed. A dramatic increase of the maximum external quantum efficiency and luminance from 2.7% and 6050&#160;cd m&#8722;2 for a 3D&#8208;only PeLEC to 8.3% and 11&#8239;200&#160;cd m&#8722;2 for a 3D&#8211;0D PNC device with only 7% by weight of 0D PNCs is observed. The majority of this increase is driven by the efficient inherent emission of the 0D PNCs, while the concomitant morphology improvement also contributes to reduced leakage current, reduced hysteresis, and enhanced operational lifetime (half&#8208;life of 129 h), making this one of the best&#8208;performing LECs reported to date.

         <title>Multiple&#8208;Resonance Extension and Spin&#8208;Vibronic Coupling Based Narrowband Blue Organic Fluorescence Emitters with over 30% Quantum Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Achieving narrow&#8208;bandwidth emission and high external quantum efficiency (EQE) simultaneously has been a challenge for next&#8208;generation blue&#8208;emitting organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). In this study, we developed novel multiple&#8208;resonance thermally&#8208;activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters by fusing an indolocarbazole unit with two carbazole skeletons using para&#8208;oriented nitrogen atoms. The resulting rigid and planar &#960;&#8208;system without electron&#8208;accepting atoms exhibits pure blue photoluminescence at 470&#160;nm, reaching a 100% quantum yield with a full&#8208;width&#8208;at&#8208;half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 25&#160;nm. Higher&#8208;level quantum chemistry calculations confirmed an multiple&#8208;resonance (MR) effect within the extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation and an enhanced triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet crossover (104 s&#8722;1) through a reduced energy gap (&#916;EST) coupled with large spin&#8208;vibronic coupling mediated by low&#8208;lying triplet excited states. An OLED fabricated using the MR&#8208;TADF emitter with CIE color coordinates of (0.12, 0.16) exhibits a record high EQE of 30.9% and a small FWHM of 23&#160;nm. With further optimization of the device structure, we achieved a high EQE of 33.8% without additional outcoupling enhancements owing to the near&#8208;perfect horizontal alignment of the emitting dipoles.

         <title>Superior Fast Charging Lithium Ion Batteries Enabled by High Speed Solid State Lithium Transport of Intermetallic Cu6Sn5 Network</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Superior fast charging is a desirable capability of lithium&#8208;ion batteries, which can make electric vehicles a strong competition to traditional fuel vehicles. However, the slow transport of solvated lithium ions in liquid electrolytes is a limiting factor. Here, we report a LixCu6Sn5 intermetallic network to address this issue. Based on electrochemical analysis and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy mapping, we demonstrate that the reported intermetallic network can form a high&#8208;speed solid&#8208;state lithium transport matrix throughout the electrode, which largely reduces the polarization effect in the graphite anode. Employing this design, we fabricated superior fast&#8208;charging graphite/lithium cobalt oxide full cells and tested them under strict electrode conditions. At the charging rate of 6 C, the fabricated full cells showed a capacity of 145 mAh g&#8722;1 with an extraordinary capacity retention of 96.6%. In addition, the full cell also exhibits good electrochemical stability at a high charging rate of 2 C over 100 cycles (96.0% of capacity retention) in comparison to traditional graphite anode based cell (86.1% of capacity retention). This work presents a new strategy for fast charging lithium ion batteries on basis of high speed solid state lithium transport in intermetallic alloy hosts.

         <title>Cold&#8208;Starting All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries from Room Temperature by Thermally Modulated Current Collector in Sub&#8208;Minute</title>

Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) show great potential as high&#8208;energy and high&#8208;power energy storage devices but their attainable energy/power density at room temperature is severely reduced because of the sluggish kinetics of lithium&#8208;ion transport. Here we first reported a thermally modulated current collector (TMCC), which can rapidly cold&#8208;start ASSBs from room temperature to operating temperatures (70&#8764;90 &#176;C) in less than one minute, and simultaneously enhance the transient peak power density by 15&#8208;fold compared to one without heating. This TMCC is prepared by integrating a uniform, ultrathin (&#8764;200&#160;nm) nickel layer as a thermal modulator within an ultralight polymer&#8208;based current collector. By isolating the thermal modulator from the ion/electron pathway of ASSBs, it can provide fast, stable heat control yet does not interfere with regular battery operation. Moreover, this ultrathin (13.2&#160;&#956;m) TMCC effectively shortens the heat transfer pathway, minimizes heat losses, and mitigates the formation of local hot spots. The simulated heating energy consumption can be as low as &#8764;3.94% of total battery energy. This TMCC design with good tunability opens new frontiers towards smart energy storage devices in the future from the current collector perspective.

         <title>Intracellular Crowding by Bio&#8208;Orthogonal Hydrogel Formation Induces Reversible Molecular Stasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intracellular crosslinking in living cells using poly(ethylene glycol) macromers is introduced. Increased macromolecular crowding in the cytosol of the cell causes crosslink&#8208;induced quiescence and results in reduced protein translation, cellular motility, and actin dynamics while cell viability remains high. The effects can be reversed through polymer degradation with UV light.








Abstract
To survive extreme conditions, certain animals enter a reversible protective stasis through vitrification of the cytosol by polymeric molecules such as proteins and polysaccharides. In this work, synthetic gelation of the cytosol in living cells is used to induce reversible molecular stasis. Through the sequential lipofectamine&#8208;mediated transfection of complementary poly(ethylene glycol) macromers into mammalian cells, intracellular crosslinking occurs through bio&#8208;orthogonal strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition click reactions. This achieves efficient polymer uptake with minimal cell death (99% viable). Intracellular crosslinking decreases DNA replication and protein synthesis, and increases the quiescent population by 2.5&#8208;fold. Real&#8208;time tracking of single cells containing intracellular crosslinked polymers identifies increases in intermitotic time (15 h&#160;vs 19 h) and decreases in motility (30 &#181;m h&#8722;1&#160;vs 15&#160;&#181;m h&#8722;1). The cytosol viscosity increases threefold after intracellular crosslinking and results in disordered cytoskeletal structure in addition to the disruption of cellular coordination in a scratch assay. By incorporating photodegradable nitrobenzyl moieties into the polymer backbone, the effects of intracellular crosslinking are reversed upon exposure to light, thereby restoring proliferation (80% phospho&#8208;Rb+ cells), protein translation, and migration. Reversible intracellular crosslinking provides a novel method for dynamic manipulation of intracellular mechanics, altering essential processes that determine cellular function.

         <title>3R Electronics: Scalable Fabrication of Resilient, Repairable, and Recyclable Soft&#8208;Matter Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3R&#8208;electronics are introduced here: the next generation of soft&#8208;matter electronics that are Resilient, Repairable and Recyclable. It is proposed that 3R&#8208;electronics should replace current electronics, as they permit sustainable circular economy. 3R&#8208;electronics are implemented through novel liquid&#8208;metal&#8208;based composites, unique high&#8208;resolution digital fabrication techniques, and an unprecedented room&#8208;temperature soldering method that permits for the first time, utilization of heat&#8208;sensitive polymers in microchip&#8208;integrated circuits.








Abstract
E&#8208;waste is rapidly turning into another man&#8208;made disaster. It is proposed that a paradigm shift toward a more sustainable future can be made through soft&#8208;matter electronics that are resilient, repairable if damaged, and recyclable (3R), provided that they achieve the same level of maturity as industrial electronics. This includes high&#8208;resolution patterning, multilayer implementation, microchip integration, and automated fabrication. Herein, a novel architecture of materials and methods for microchip&#8208;integrated condensed soft&#8208;matter 3R electronics is demonstrated. The 3R function is enabled by a biphasic liquid metal&#8208;based composite, a block copolymer with nonpermanent physical crosslinks, and an electrochemical technique for material recycling. In addition, an autonomous laser&#8208;patterning method for scalable circuit patterning with an exceptional resolution of &lt;30&#160;&#181;m in seconds is developed. The phase&#8208;shifting property of the BCPs is utilized for vapor&#8208;assisted &#8220;soldering&#8221; circuit repairing and recycling. The process is performed entirely at room temperature, thereby opening the door for a wide range of heat&#8208;sensitive and biodegradable polymers for the next generation of green electronics. The implementation and recycling of sophisticated skin&#8208;mounted patches with embedded sensors, electrodes, antennas, and microchips that build a digital fingerprint of the human electrophysiological signals is demonstrated by collecting mechanical, electrical, optical, and thermal data from the epidermis.

         <title>Observation of Topological Edge States in Thermal Diffusion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topological phases have been demonstrated in various wave systems, however, they still remain unexplored in a purely diffusive system. This work reveals the topological phase in a&#160;purely diffusive system, that is, a thermal lattice. The experimental results show that the nontrivial topological phase of the thermal lattice can enable thermal edge states that exponentially decay within the gap of bulk decays.








Abstract
Topological band theory predicts that bulk materials with nontrivial topological phases support topological edge states. This phenomenon is universal for various wave systems and is widely observed for electromagnetic and acoustic waves. Here, the notion of band topology is extended from wave to diffusion dynamics. Unlike wave systems that are usually Hermitian, diffusion systems are anti&#8208;Hermitian with purely imaginary eigenvalues corresponding to decay rates. By direct probe of the temperature diffusion, the Hamiltonian of a thermal lattice is experimentally retrieved, and the emergence of topological edge decays is observed within the gap of bulk decays. The results of this work show that such edge states exhibit robust decay rates, which are topologically protected against disorder. This work constitutes a thermal analogue of topological insulators and paves the way to exploring defect&#8208;immune heat dissipation.

         <title>Maneuvering Applications of Covalent Organic Frameworks via Framework&#8208;Morphology Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Translating the performance of Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) from laboratory to macroscopic reality demands specific morphologies. Thus, the advancement in morphological modulation has recently gained some momentum. A clear understanding of nano to macroscopic architecture is critical to determine, optimize and improve performances of this atomically precise porous material. Along with their chemical compositions and molecular frameworks, the prospect of morphology in various applications should be discussed and highlighted. A thorough insight into morphology&#8208; versus application would help produce better&#8208;engineered COFs for practical implications. Two and three&#8208;dimensional frameworks can be transformed into various solids such as nanospheres, thin films, membranes, monoliths, foams, etc., for numerous applications in adsorption, separation photocatalysis, carbon dioxide reduction, supercapacitor, and fuel cell. However, the research on COF&#8208;chemistry mainly focuses on correlating structure to property, structure to morphology, and structure to applications. Here, we have provided critical insights on various morphological evolution and associated applications. In each case, the underlying role of morphology has been unveiled. Towards the end, a correlation between morphology and application has been provided for the future development of COFs.

         <title>Walking Dead Tumor Cells for Targeted Drug Delivery Against Lung Metastasis of Triple Negative Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Lung metastasis is challenging in patients with triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC). Surgery is always not available due to the dissemination of metastatic foci and most of drugs are powerless because of poor retention at metastatic sites. TNBC cells generate inflamed microenvironment and overexpress adhesive molecules to promote the invasion and colonization. Herein, we develop walking dead TNBC cells through conjugating anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 (programmed death protein 1 inhibitor) and doxorubicin (DOX)&#8208;loaded liposomes onto cell corpses for temporal chemo&#8208;immunotherapy against lung metastasis. The walking dead TNBC cells maintain plenary tumor antigens to conduct vaccination effects. Anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 antibodies are conjugated to cell corpses via reduction&#8208;activated linker, and DOX&#8208;loaded liposomes are attached by maleimide&#8208;thiol coupling. This anchor strategy enables rapid release of anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 upon reduction conditions while long&#8208;lasting release of DOX at inflamed metastatic sites. The walking dead TNBC cells improve pulmonary accumulation and local retention of drugs, reprogram lung microenvironment through damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and PD&#8208;1 blockade, and prolong overall survival of lung metastatic 4T1 and EMT6&#8208;bearing mice. Taking advantage of the walking dead TNBC cells for pulmonary preferred delivery of chemotherapeutics and checkpoint inhibitors, this study suggests an alternative treatment option of chemo&#8208;immunotherapy to augment the efficacy against lung metastasis.

         <title>Digital Light Processing 3D Printing of Tough Supramolecular Hydrogels with Sophisticated Architectures as Impact&#8208;Absorption Elements</title>

Abstract
Processing tough hydrogels into sophisticated architectures is crucial for their applications as structural elements. However, digital light processing (DLP) printing of tough hydrogels is challenging because of the low&#8208;speed gelation and toughening process. Described here is a simple yet versatile system suitable for DLP printing to form tough hydrogel architectures. The aqueous precursor consists of commercial photo&#8208;initiator, acrylic acid, and zirconium ion (Zr4+), readily forming tough metallosupramolecular hydrogel under digital light because of in situ formation of carboxyl&#8208;Zr4+ coordination complexes. The high stiffness and anti&#8208;swelling property of as&#8208;printed gel enable high&#8208;efficiency printing to form high&#8208;fidelity constructs. Furthermore, swelling&#8208;induced morphing of the gel is also achieved by encoding structure gradients during the printing with grayscale digital light. Mechanical properties of the printed hydrogels are further improved after incubation in water due to the variation of local pH and rearrangement of coordination complex. The swelling&#8208;enhanced stiffness affords the printed hydrogel with shape fixation ability after manual deformations, and thereby provides an additional avenue to form more complex configurations. These printed hydrogels are used to devise impact&#8208;absorption element or high&#8208;sensitivity pressure sensor as proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept examples. This work should merit engineering of other tough gels and extend their scope of applications in diverse fields.

Abstract
In the past two decades, organic electronic materials have enabled and accelerated a large and diverse set of technologies, from energy harvesting devices and electro&#8208;mechanical actuators, to flexible and printed (opto)electronic circuitry. Among organic (semi)conductors, mixed ionic&#8208;electron conductors (OMIECs) are now at the center of renewed interest in organic electronics, as they are key drivers of recent developments in the fields of bioelectronics, energy storage, and neuromorphic computing. However, due to the relatively slow switching dynamics of organic electronics, their application in microwave technology, until recently, has been overlooked. Nonetheless, other unique properties of OMIECs, such as their substantial electrochemical tunability, charge modulation range and processability, make this field of use ripe with opportunities. In this work, we demonstrate the use of a series of solution&#8208;processed intrinsic OMIECs to actively tune the properties of metamaterial&#8208;inspired microwave devices, including an untethered bioelectrochemical sensing platform that requires no external power, and a tunable resonating structure with independent amplitude&#8208; and frequency&#8208;modulation. These devices showcase the considerable potential of OMIEC&#8208;based metadevices in autonomous bioelectronics and reconfigurable microwave optics.

         <title>Electrochemical Construction of Edge&#8208;Contacted Metal&#8208;Semiconductor Junctions with Low Contact Barrier</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile approach is developed for constructing high&#8208;quality metal&#8208;2D semiconductor junctions through the edge&#8208;guided electrodeposition. Cross&#8208;sectional imaging and transport measurements confirm the seamless contact of Pd with each layer of MoS2 greatly reduces the contact barrier to &#8776;20 meV and contact resistance to &#8776;290 &#937;&#160;&#181;m and thus significantly increases the performance of FETs with Pd nanowire edge contacts.








Abstract
2D semiconductors, such as MoS2 have emerged as promising ultrathin channel materials for the further scaling of field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs). However, the contact barrier at the metal&#8208;2D semiconductor junctions still significantly limits the device's performance. By extending the application of electrochemical deposition in 2D electronics, a distinct approach is developed for constructing metal&#8208;2D semiconductor junctions in an edge&#8208;contacted configuration through the edge&#8208;guided electrodeposition of varied metals. Both high&#8208;resolution microscopic imaging and electrical transport measurements confirm the successful creation of high&#8208;quality Pd&#8208;2D MoS2 junctions in desired geometry by combining electrodeposition with lithographic patterning. FETs are fabricated on the obtained Pd&#8208;2D MoS2 junctions and it is confirmed that these junctions exhibit a reduced contact barrier of &#8776;20&#160;meV and extremely low contact resistance of 290&#160;&#937;&#160;&#181;m and thus increase the averaged mobility of MoS2 FETs to &#8776;108&#160;cm2 V &#8722;1 s&#8722;1. This approach paves a new way for the construction of metal&#8208;semiconductor junctions and also demonstrates the great potential of the electrochemical deposition technique in 2D electronics.

         <title>The Non&#8208;Classical Crystallization Mechanism of a Composite Biogenic Guanine Crystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By following crystal formation in embryonic spiders, a long&#8208;sought crystallization mechanism for biogenic guanine is revealed. Guanine nucleates from a disordered precursor phase. The crystals grow by the orientated attachment of partially ordered nanogranules into platelets, which coalesce into single crystals, via gradual relaxation of structural defects. The mature guanine is a composite of crystal lamellae intercalated by macromolecular sheets.








Abstract
Spectacular colors and visual phenomena in animals are produced by light interference from highly reflective guanine crystals. Little is known about how organisms regulate crystal morphology to tune the optics of these systems. By following guanine crystal formation in developing spiders, a crystallization mechanism is elucidated. Guanine crystallization is a &#8220;non&#8208;classical,&#8221; multistep process involving a progressive ordering of states. Crystallization begins with nucleation of partially ordered nanogranules from a disordered precursor phase. Growth proceeds by orientated attachment of the nanogranules into platelets which coalesce into single crystals, via progressive relaxation of structural defects. Despite their prismatic morphology, the platelet texture is retained in the final crystals, which are composites of crystal lamellae and interlamellar sheets. Interactions between the macromolecular sheets and the planar face of guanine appear to direct nucleation, favoring platelet formation. These findings provide insights on how organisms control the morphology and optical properties of molecular crystals.

         <title>Asymmetrically Enhanced Coplanar&#8208;Electrode Electroluminescence for Information Encryption and Ultrahighly Stretchable&#160;Displays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the impedance&#8208;voltage division principle and the voltage&#8208;luminance relationship, simply fabricated asymmetrically enhanced alternating&#8208;current&#8208;driven electroluminescent (AECE AC&#8208;EL) devices are designed. The AECE AC&#8208;EL configuration is successfully applied in feasible information encryption and ultrahighly stretchable pattern displays, signifying magnificent application prospects in the elegant wearable electronic systems with intelligent, multifunctional, and full&#8208;color displays.








Abstract
Traditional alternating&#8208;current&#8208;driven electroluminescent (AC&#8208;EL) devices adopting a sandwich structure are commonly used in solid&#8208;state lighting and displays, while the emerging coplanar&#8208;electrode alternating&#8208;current&#8208;driven light&#8208;emitting variants manifest excellent application prospects in intelligent, multifunctional, and full&#8208;color displays, and sensing purposes. In this work, an asymmetrically&#160;enhanced coplanar&#8208;electrode AC&#8208;EL device with a universal and straightforward architecture is designed based on the impedance adjustment strategy. This newly devised asymmetric structure extends the functionalities of the coplanar&#8208;electrode AC&#8208;EL devices by overcoming the bottlenecks of complicated patterning procedures and high driving voltages of symmetric configuration. The developed device design enables a new type of information encryption and ultrahighly stretchable patterned displays. Notably, the novel encryption appliances demonstrate feasible encryption/decryption features, multiple encryptions, and practical applicability; the biaxially stretchable display devices achieve the highest tensile performance in the field of stretchable electroluminescent pattern displays, and outperform the ultrahighly stretchable sandwich devices in terms of simple patterning process, higher brightness, wider color gamut, and long&#8208;term stability. The proposed configuration opens up new avenues for AC&#8208;EL devices toward a plethora of smart applications in wearable electronics with intelligent displays, dynamic interaction of human&#8208;machine interface, and soft robotics.

         <title>Topological Crystalline Insulator Candidate ErAsS with Hourglass Fermion and Magnetic&#8208;Tuned Topological Phase Transition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A layered air&#8208;stable topological crystalline insulator (TCI) candidate, ErAsS, is designed and synthesized, which maps the atomic layers in real space to the band topology in momentum space. The distorted As atomic layer and magnetic order of ErAsS induce both the hourglass fermion surface state and the magnetic&#8208;tuned exotic phases including the possible magnetic TCI.








Abstract
Topological crystalline insulators (TCIs) with hourglass fermion surface state have attracted a lot of attention and are further enriched by crystalline symmetries and magnetic order. Here, the emergence of hourglass fermion surface state and exotic phases in the newly discovered, air&#8208;stable ErAsS single crystals are shown. In the paramagnetic phase, ErAsS is expected to be a TCI with hourglass fermion surface state protected by the nonsymmorphic symmetry. Dirac&#8208;cone&#8208;like bands and nearly linear dispersions in large energy range are experimentally observed, consistent well with theoretical calculations. Below TN&#160;&#8776; 3.27 K, ErAsS enters a collinear antiferromagnetic state, which is a trivial insulator breaking the time&#8208;reversal symmetry. An intermediate incommensurate magnetic state appears in a narrow temperature range (3.27&#8211;3.65 K), exhibiting an abrupt change in magnetic coupling. The results reveal that ErAsS is an experimentally available TCI candidate and provide a unique platform to understand the formation of hourglass fermion surface state and explore magnetic&#8208;tuned topological phase transitions.

         <title>Rashba&#8208;Edelstein Effect in the h&#8208;BN Van Der Waals Interface for Magnetization Switching</title>

Abstract
Van der Waals (vdW) materials are attracting great attention in the field of spintronics due to their novel physical properties.[2] For example, they have been utilized as spin&#8208;current generating materials in spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT) devices, which offers an electrical way to control the magnetic state and is promising for future low&#8208;power electronics.[4] However, SOTs have mostly been demonstrated in vdW materials[5&#8211;7] with strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC). Here, we report the observation of the current&#8208;induced SOT in the h&#8208;BN/SrRuO3 bilayer structure, where the vdW material(h&#8208;BN) is an insulator with negligible SOC. Importantly, this SOT is strong enough to induce the switching of the perpendicular magnetization in SrRuO3. Our first&#8208;principles calculations suggest a giant Rashba effect at the interface between vdW material and SrRuO3 (110)pc thin film, which leads to the observed SOT based on a simplified tight&#8208;binding model. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the current&#8208;induced magnetization switching can be modulated by the electric field. Our study paves the way for exploring the current&#8208;induced SOT and magnetization switching by integrating vdW materials with ferromagnets.

         <title>Effective Approaches for Designing Stable M&#8211;Nx/C Oxygen&#8211;Reduction Catalysts for Proton&#8208;Exchange&#8208;Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effective approaches for designing stable M&#8211;Nx/C non&#8208;precious&#8208;metal oxygen&#8211;reduction catalysts for proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cells are summarized. The thermodynamics and kinetics aspects of the stability of the M&#8211;Nx/C catalysts are introduced. The primary degradation mechanisms of the M&#8211;Nx/C catalysts and the corresponding mitigating strategies are discussed in detail, with future perspectives highlighted.








Abstract
The large&#8208;scale commercialization of proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) is extremely limited by their costly platinum&#8208;group metals (PGMs) catalysts, which are used for catalyzing the sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics at the cathode. Among the reported PGM&#8208;free catalysts so far, metal&#8211;nitrogen&#8211;carbon (M&#8211;Nx/C) catalysts hold a great potential to replace PGMs catalysts for the ORR due to their excellent initial activity and low cost. However, despite tremendous progress in this field in the past decade, their further applications are restricted by fast degradation under practical conditions. Herein, the theoretical fundamentals of the stability of the M&#8211;Nx/C catalysts are first introduced in terms of thermodynamics and kinetics. The primary degradation mechanisms of M&#8211;Nx/C catalysts and the corresponding mitigating strategies are discussed in detail. Finally, the current challenges and the prospects for designing highly stable M&#8211;Nx/C catalysts are outlined.

         <title>Necklace&#8208;like Nanostructures: from Fabrication, Properties to Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The shape&#8208;controlled synthesis of nanocrystals remains a hot research topic in nanotechnology. Particularly, the fabrication of one&#8208;dimensional (1D) structures such as wires, rods, belts, and tubes has been an interesting and important subject within nanoscience in the last few decades. 1D necklace&#8208;like micro/nano&#8208;structures are a sophisticated geometry that has attracted increasing attention due to their anisotropic and periodic structure, intrinsic high surface area, abundant transport channels, exposure of each component to the surface, and multiscale roughness of the surface. These characteristics enable their unique electrical, optical, and catalytic properties. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the advanced research progress on the fabrication strategies, novel properties, and various applications of necklace&#8208;like structures. It begins with the main fabrication methods of necklace&#8208;like structures and subsequently details a variety of their properties and applications. It concludes with the authors&#8217; perspectives on future research and development of the necklace&#8208;like structures.

         <title>Switchable unipolar&#8208;barrier van der Waals heterostructures with natural anisotropy for full linear polarimetry detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Polarization&#8208;resolved photodetection in a compact footprint is of great interests for ultra&#8208;miniaturized polarimeter to be used in a wide range of applications. However, states of polarization (SOP) probing in natural anisotropy materials are usually weak, limited by material's natural dichroism or diattenuation. Here, we report a twisted unipolar&#8208;barrier van der Waals heterostructure (vdWH) to construct a bias&#8208;switchable polarization detection for retrieval of full SOP state (from 0 to 180&#176;) for linear polarized incident light. As a demonstration example, we realized the concept in a b&#8208;AsP/WS2/b&#8208;AsP vdWH relying on the natural anisotropy properties of the materials without using additional plasmonic/metasurface nanostructures to realize linear polarimetry in the mid&#8208;infrared range. Polarimetric imaging is further demonstrated with the developed linear polarimetry by directly displaying the Jones vector&#8208;described SOP distribution of certain target object. Our method with the capabilities of detecting full linear SOP is promising for the next&#8208;generation on&#8208;chip miniaturized polarimeter.

The lack of alignment expands the intrinsic interlayer distances and weakens the optical and electronic interactions between adjacent layers. This introduces properties distinct from those structures with well&#8208;aligned lattices and strong coupling interactions. However, direct, and rapid synthesis of turbostratic materials remains a challenge owing to their thermodynamically metastable properties. Here, we report a flash Joule heating (FJH) method to achieve bulk synthesis of boron&#8208;carbon&#8208;nitrogen ternary compounds with turbostratic structures by a kinetically controlled ultrafast cooling process that takes place within milliseconds (103&#8764;104 K s&#8211;1). Theoretical calculations support the existence of turbostratic structures and provide estimates of the energy barriers with respect to conversion into the corresponding well&#8208;aligned counterparts. When using non&#8208;carbon conductive additives, a direct synthesis of boron nitride is possible. The turbostratic nature facilitates mechanical exfoliation and more stable dispersions. Accordingly, the addition of flash products to a polyvinyl alcohol nanocomposite film coating a copper surface greatly improves the copper's resistance to corrosion in 0.5 M sulfuric acid or 3.5 wt% saline solution. FJH allows the use of bulk materials as reactants and provides a rapid approach to large quantities of the hitherto hard&#8208;to&#8208;access turbostratic materials.

         <title>Superconducting Material Based Maglev Generator Used for Outer&#8208;Space</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Solar cells are conventionally used to harvest energy in outer space, but they are ineffective in dark locations. Here, we show that superconducting materials &#8211; which work best in cold environments, such as those found in outer space&#8212;provide a mechanism to harvest energy that does not require light. A superconducting maglev (magnetic levitation) magnetoelectric generator (SMMG) can convert mechanical impacts to electricity at its working temperature &lt;90 K. The SMMG device consists of a permanent magnet, a conductive coil, and a superconducting layer (SL). Owing to the existence of the SL, the permanent magnet levitates over the SL and rapidly returns to an equilibrium height after being displaced by a mechanical impact. The impact changes the gap between the levitated magnet and the coil, resulting in a variation in magnetic flux that induces electrical current in the coil. Thus, the SMMG converts low&#8208;frequency (&lt;3.7&#160;Hz) mechanical energy to electricity. The output maximum peak voltage, peak power, and peak power density of the SMMG are 4.3&#160;V, 35&#160;mW, and 17.8 W/m2, respectively, with a load resistance of 300 ohms. The SMMG can charge a capacitor of 10000 &#956;F to 3.8&#160;V with a continuous impact, which is sufficient to power critical wireless communication. The superconductor works best in cold environments and therefore is well&#8208;suited for providing electricity to sensors and communication devices in outer space, particularly in places where the sun may not reach.

         <title>Promoting Dinuclear&#8208;Type Catalysis in Cu1&#8208;C3N4 Single Atom Catalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Reducing particle size in supported metal catalyst to single atom level isolates the active metal sites and maximizes the atomic utilization efficiency. However, the large inter&#8208;atom distance, particularly in low&#8208;loading single atom catalyst (SAC), is not favourable for a complex reaction where two (or more) reactants have to be activated. A key question is how to control the inter&#8208;atom distances to promote dinuclear&#8208;type co&#8208;activation at the adjacent metal sites. Here, we report that reducing the average inter&#8208;atom distance of Cu1 SAC supported on C3N4 to 0.74 &#177; 0.13&#160;nm allows these catalysts to exhibit dinuclear&#8208;type catalytic mechanism in nitrile&#8208;azide cycloaddition. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure study reveals a dynamic ligand exchange process between nitrile and azide, followed by their co&#8208;activation on dinuclear Cu SAC sites to form the tetrazole product. This work highlights that reducing the nearest neighbour distance of SAC allows mechanistic pathway to diversify from single site to multi&#8208;site catalysis.

         <title>Surface Oxygen Vacancies Confined by Ferroelectric Polarization for Tunable CO Oxidation Kinetics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface oxygen vacancies are well confined near the interface between Pt {111} nanocrystals and the negative polar surface (001) of ferroelectric PbTiO3 nanoplate. The vacancies are stabilized electrostatically by ferroelectric polarization, giving rise to tunable catalytic CO oxidation kinetics from 200&#160;&#176;C to near room temperature. A new pathway of CO oxidation via polarization&#8208;stabilized oxygen vacancies accounts for the tunable reaction activity.








Abstract
Surface oxygen vacancies have been widely discussed to be crucial for tailoring the activity of various chemical reactions from CO, NO, to water oxidation by using oxide&#8208;supported catalysts. However, the real role and potential function of surface oxygen vacancies in the reaction remains unclear because of their very short lifetime. Here, it is reported that surface oxygen vacancies can be well confined electrostatically for a polarization screening near the perimeter interface between Pt {111} nanocrystals and the negative polar surface (001) of ferroelectric PbTiO3. Strikingly, such a catalyst demonstrates a tunable catalytic CO oxidation kinetics from 200&#160;&#176;C to near room temperature by increasing the O2 gas pressure, accompanied by the conversion curve from a hysteresis&#8208;free loop to one with hysteresis. The combination of reaction kinetics, electronic energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) analysis, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, indicates that the oxygen vacancies stabilized by the negative polar surface are the active sites for O2 adsorption as a rate&#8208;determining step, and then dissociated O moves to the surface of the Pt nanocrystals for oxidizing adsorbed CO. The results open a new pathway for tunable catalytic activity of CO oxidation.

         <title>A Top&#8208;down Strategy to Engineer Active Layer Morphology for Highly Efficient and Stable All&#8208;polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
A major challenge hindering the further development of all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) employing polymerized small&#8208;molecule acceptors is the relatively low fill factor (FF) due to the difficulty in controlling active layer morphology. The issues typically arise from oversized phase separation resulting from the thermodynamically unfavorable mixing between two macromolecular species, and disordered molecular orientation/packing of highly anisotropic polymer chains. Herein, a facile top&#8208;down controlling strategy to engineer the morphology of all&#8208;polymer blends is developed by leveraging the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LBL) deposition. Optimal intermixing of polymer components could be achieved in the two&#8208;step process by tuning the bottom&#8208;layer polymer swelling during top&#8208;layer deposition. As a result, both the molecular orientation/packing of bottom layer and the crystallinity of top layer can be optimized with a suitable processing solvent for the top layer. Consequently, a favorable morphology with gradient vertical composition distribution for efficient charge transport and extraction is realized, affording a high all&#8208;PSC efficiency of 17.0% with a remarkable FF of 76.1%. The derived devices also possess excellent long&#8208;term thermal stability which can retain &gt;90% of their initial efficiencies after being annealed at 65 &#176;C for 1300 h. These results validate that the distinct advantages of employing such LBL processing protocol to fabricate high&#8208;performance all&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Cluster&#8208;Glass for Low&#8208;Cost White&#8208;Light Emission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The development of efficient and high&#8208;brilliance white&#8208;light sources is an essential contribution to innovative emission technologies. Materials exhibiting strong non&#8208;linear optical properties, in particular second harmonic generation (SHG) or white&#8208;light generation (WLG), have therefore been investigated with great activity in recent times. While many new approaches have been reported until now, the processability of the compounds remains a challenge. Here, we introduce a new class of materials, denoted as &#8220;cluster&#8208;glass&#8221;, which do not only show superior white&#8208;light emission properties upon irradiation by an inexpensive continuous&#8208;wave infrared laser diode, but can be easily accommodated in size and shape by formation of robust glassy solids. The cluster&#8208;glass materials are fabricated by mild heating from crystalline powders of adamantane&#8208;type clusters exhibiting a quaternary, inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid cluster core [(PhSi)(CH2)3(PhSn)E3] (E&#160; = &#160;S, Se, Te). The process is fully reversible and preserves the integrity of the clusters in the glass, as proven by solution spectroscopy and re&#8208;crystallization. Theoretical studies corroborate the importance of the quaternary nature of the cluster cores for the observed structural and optical phenomena. Thanks to these findings, high brilliance white&#8208;light sources can be synthesized in form of stable, robust glass of any shape, which ultimately renders them suitable for everyday's applications.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of efficient and high-brilliance white-light sources is an essential contribution to innovative emission technologies. Materials exhibiting strong non-linear optical properties, in particular second harmonic generation (SHG) or white-light generation (WLG), have therefore been investigated with great activity in recent times. While many new approaches have been reported until now, the processability of the compounds remains a challenge. Here, we introduce a new class of materials, denoted as &#8220;cluster-glass&#8221;, which do not only show superior white-light emission properties upon irradiation by an inexpensive continuous-wave infrared laser diode, but can be easily accommodated in size and shape by formation of robust glassy solids. The cluster-glass materials are fabricated by mild heating from crystalline powders of adamantane-type clusters exhibiting a quaternary, inorganic-organic hybrid cluster core [(PhSi)(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(PhSn)E&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] (E&#160; = &#160;S, Se, Te). The process is fully reversible and preserves the integrity of the clusters in the glass, as proven by solution spectroscopy and re-crystallization. Theoretical studies corroborate the importance of the quaternary nature of the cluster cores for the observed structural and optical phenomena.

         <title>Binary Organic Solar Cells Breaking 19% via Manipulating Vertical Component Distribution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The variation of vertical component distribution can significantly influence photovoltaic performance of organic solar cells (OSCs), mainly due to its impact on the exciton dissociation, and the charge carrier transport and recombination. Herein, the binary devices are fabricated via sequential deposition (SD) of D18 and L8&#8208;BO materials in a two&#8208;step process. Upon independently regulating the spin&#8208;coating speeds of each layer deposition, the optimal SD device shows a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.05% for binary single&#8208;junction OSCs, much higher than that of the corresponding blend casting (BC) device (18.14%). Impressively, this strategy presents excellent universality in boosting photovoltaic performance of SD devices, exemplified by several nonfullerene acceptor systems. The mechanism studies reveal that the SD device with preferred vertical components distribution possesses high crystallinity, efficient exciton split, low energy loss, and balanced charge transport, resulting in all&#8208;around enhancement of photovoltaic performances. This work provides a valuable approach for high efficiency OSCs, shedding light on understanding the relationship between photovoltaic performances and vertical component distribution.

         <title>Formulating High&#8208;Rate and Long&#8208;Cycle Heterostructured Layered Oxide Cathodes by Local Chemistry and Orbital Hybridization Modulation for Sodium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
It is still very urgent and challenging to simultaneously develop high&#8208;rate and long&#8208;cycle oxide cathodes for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) because of its sluggish kinetics and complex multiphase evolution during cycling. Here, we report the concept of accurately manipulating structural evolution and formulating high&#8208;performance heterostructured biphasic layered oxide cathodes by local chemistry and orbital hybridization modulation. The P2&#8208;structure stoichiometric composition of cathode material shows a layered P2&#8208; and O3&#8208;type heterostructure that is explicitly evidenced by various macroscale and atomic&#8208;scale techniques. Surprisingly, the heterostructured cathode displays excellent rate performance, remarkable cycling stability (capacity retention of 82.16% after 600 cycles at 2C), and outstanding compatibility with hard carbon anode because of the integrated advantages of intergrowth structure and local environment regulation. Meanwhile, the formation process from precursors during calcination and the highly reversible dynamic structural evolution during the Na+ intercalation/deintercalation process are clearly articulated by a series of in situ characterization techniques. Also, the intrinsic structural properties and corresponding electrochemical behavior are further elucidating by the density of states and electron localization function of density functional theory calculations. Overall, this strategy, which finely tunes the local chemistry and orbitals hybridization for high&#8208;performance SIBs, will open up a new field for other materials.

         <title>Spontaneous Construction of Nucleophilic Carbonyl&#8208;Containing Interphase towards Ultra&#8208;Stable Zinc Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Multifunctional interfacial engineering on Zn anode to conquer the dendrite growth, hydrogen evolution and sluggish kinetics associated with Zn deposition is highly desirable for boosting the commercialization of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, a spontaneous construction of carbonyl&#8208;containing layer on Zn anode (Zn@ZCO) is rationally designed as an ion redistributor and functional protective interphase. It has strong zincphilicity and dendrite suppression ability due to the significant interaction of the high&#8208;electronegative and high&#8208;nucleophilic carbonyl oxygen, favoring ion transport and homogenizing Zn deposition effectively. On the other side, the hydrogen bond formed by the proton acceptor of oxygen atom in ZCO regulates Zn&#8208;ion desolvation process at interfaces, thus bounding water activity and then mitigating the water&#8208;induced parasitic reactions. Consequently, the Zn@ZCO anode exhibits an extended cycling lifespan of 5000 h (more than 208 days) with a dendrite&#8208;free surface and negligible by&#8208;products. More encouragingly, the effectiveness is also convincing in NH4V4O10&#8208;based full&#8208;cells with excellent rate performance and cyclic stability. The stabilized Zn anode enabled by spontaneous construction strategy of functional solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase brings forward a facile and instructive approach towards high&#8208;performance zinc&#8208;storage systems.

         <title>Dynamic Surface Evolution of Metal Oxides for Autonomous Adaptation to Catalytic Reaction Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Metal oxides possessing distinctive physical/chemical properties due to different crystal structures and stoichiometries play a pivotal role in numerous current technologies, especially heterogeneous catalysis for production/conversion of high&#8208;valued chemicals and energy. To date, many researchers have investigated the effect of the structure and composition of these materials on their reactivity to various chemical and electrochemical reactions. However, metal oxide surfaces evolve from their initial form under dynamic reaction conditions due to the autonomous behaviors of the constituent atoms to adapt to the surrounding environment. Such nanoscale surface phenomena complicate reaction mechanisms and material properties, interrupting the clarification of the origin of functionality variations in reaction environments. In this review, we categorize the current findings on the spontaneous surface reorganization of metal oxides during reactions into three types: (1) the appearance of nano&#8208;sized 2nd phase from oxides, (2) the (partial) encapsulation of oxide atoms towards supported metal surfaces, and (3) the oxide surface reconstruction with selective cation leaching in aqueous solution. We then summarize their effects on each reaction in terms of activity and stability, providing novel insight for those who design metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;based catalytic materials.

         <title>Brain Codelivery of Temozolomide and Cisplatin for Combinatorial Glioblastoma Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Glioblastoma (GBM) is an intractable malignancy with high recurrence and mortality. Temozolomide (TMZ) and cisplatin (CDDP) based combinational therapy shows promising potential for GBM therapy in clinical trials. However, significant challenges include limited blood&#8208;brain&#8208;barrier (BBB) penetration, poor targeting of GBM tissue/cells and systemic side effect which hinder its efficacy in GBM therapy. To surmount these challenges, we developed new GBM&#8208;cell membrane camouflaged and pH&#8208;sensitive biomimetic nanoparticles (MNPs) inspired by the fact that cancer cells readily pass the BBB via reducing the tightness of endothelial cells, and localizing with homologous cells. Our results showed that MNPs can efficiently co&#8208;load TMZ and CDDP, transport these across the BBB to specifically target GBM. Incorporation of pH&#8208;sensitive polymer then allows for controlled release of drug cargos at GBM sites for combinational drug therapy. Mice bearing orthotopic U87MG or drug&#8208;resistant U251R GBM tumour and treated with MNPs@TMZ+CDDP showed a potent anti&#8208;GBM effect greatly extending survival time relative to mice receiving single&#8208;drug loaded nanoparticles or equivalent doses of free drugs. No obvious side effects were apparent in histological analyses or blood routine studies. Considering these results, our new nanoparticle formulation overcomes multiple challenges currently limiting the efficacy of combined TMZ and CDDP GBM drug therapy and appears to be a promising strategy for future GBM combinatorial chemotherapy.

Abstract
Wafer&#8208;scale growth of single crystal thin films of metals, semiconductors, and insulators is crucial in manufacturing high&#8208;performance electronic and optical devices, but still challenging from both scientific and industrial perspectives. Recently, unconventional advanced synthetic approaches have been attempted and have made remarkable progress in diversifying the species of producible single crystal thin films. This review introduces several new synthetic approaches to produce large&#8208;area single crystal thin films of various materials according to the concepts and principles. Several novel concepts to produce the isostructured crystals (3D materials including metals, III&#8208;V semiconductors, oxide perovskites, halide perovskites, and organic semiconductors) are reviewed in section 2. The approaches to the anisotropic crystals (2D materials such as graphene, hBN, and metal chalcogenides) are discussed in section 3. The section 4 discusses on the relevant challenging issues in the growth and scaling of the single crystal thin films.

Abstract
The rapid growth of the electronics industry and proliferation of electronic materials and telecommunications technologies has led to the release of a massive amount of untreated electronic waste (e&#8208;waste) into the environment. Consequently, catastrophic environmental damage at the microbiome level and serious human health diseases threaten the natural fate of our planet. Currently, the demand for wearable and flexible electronics for applications in personalized medicine, electronic skins (e&#8208;skin), and health monitoring platforms is substantial and growing. Therefore, &#8220;green&#8221; characteristics such as biodegradability, self&#8208;healing behavior, and biocompatibility ensure the future application of wearable electronics and e&#8208;skins in biomedical engineering and bioanalytical sciences. Leveraging the biodegradability, sustainability, and biocompatibility of natural materials will dramatically influence the fabrication of environmentally friendly e&#8208;skins and wearable electronics. Here, the molecular and structural characteristics of biological skins and artificial e&#8208;skins are discussed. The focus then turns to the biodegradable materials, including natural and synthetic polymer&#8208;based materials, and their most recent applications in the development of biodegradable e&#8208;skin in wearable sensors, robotics, and human&#8211;machine interfaces (HMIs). Finally, the main challenges and outlook regarding the preparation and application of biodegradable e&#8208;skins are critically discussed in a near&#8208;future scenario, which is expected to lead to the next generation of biodegradable e&#8208;skins and electronics.

         <title>Tuning Organic Electrochemical Transistor Threshold Voltage using Chemically Doped Polymer Gates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) have shown promise as transducers and amplifiers of minute electronic potentials due to their large transconductances. Tuning OECT threshold voltage is important to achieve low&#8208;powered devices with amplification properties within the desired operational voltage range. However, traditional design approaches have struggled to decouple channel and materials properties from threshold voltage, thereby compromising on several other OECT performance metrics such as electrochemical stability, transconductance, and dynamic range. In this work, we utilize simple solution processing methods to chemically dope polymer gate electrodes, thereby controlling their work function, which in turn tunes the operation voltage range of OECTs without perturbing their channel properties. Chemical doping of initially air&#8208;sensitive polymer electrodes further improves their electrochemical stability in ambient conditions. Thus, we demonstrate, for the first time, OECTs which are simultaneously low&#8208;powered and electrochemically resistant to oxidative side reactions at ambient conditions. This approach shows that threshold voltage, which was once interwoven with other OECT properties, can in fact be an independent design parameter, expanding the design space of OECTs.

         <title>Reprogramming Mitochondrial Metabolism in Synovial Macrophages of Early Osteoarthritis by a Camouflaged Meta&#8208;Defensome</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The relationship between mitochondrial dysfunction and osteoarthritis (OA) severity is established and an effective strategy for reprogramming the mitochondrial metabolism is pioneered, through a novel camouflaged dual&#8208;targeting meta&#8208;Defensome, comprising macrophage&#8208;membrane&#8208;cloaked polymeric nanoparticles loaded with double nanoenzymes that scavenge mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and inhibit mitochondrial nitric oxide synthase, efficiently restoring the M1/M2 macrophage imbalance in the synovium and impeding OA progression.








Abstract
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a low&#8208;grade inflammatory and progressive joint disease, and its progression is closely associated with an imbalance in M1/M2 synovial macrophages. Repolarizing pro&#8208;inflammatory M1 macrophages into the anti&#8208;inflammatory M2 phenotype is emerging as a strategy to alleviate OA progression but is compromised by unsatisfactory efficiency. In this study, the reprogramming of mitochondrial dysfunction is pioneered with a camouflaged meta&#8208;Defensome, which can transform M1 synovial macrophages into the M2 phenotype with a high efficiency of 82.3%. The meta&#8208;Defensome recognizes activated macrophages via receptor&#8211;ligand interactions and accumulates in the mitochondria through electrostatic attractions. These meta&#8208;Defensomes are macrophage&#8208;membrane&#8208;coated polymeric nanoparticles decorated with dual ligands and co&#8208;loaded with S&#8208;methylisothiourea and MnO2. Meta&#8208;Defensomes are demonstrated to successfully reprogram the mitochondrial metabolism of M1 macrophages by scavenging mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and inhibiting mitochondrial NO synthase, thereby increasing mitochondrial transcription factor A expression and restoring aerobic respiration. Furthermore, meta&#8208;Defensomes are intravenously injected into collagenase&#8208;induced osteoarthritis mice and effectively suppress synovial inflammation and progression of early OA, as evident from the Osteoarthritis Research Society International score. Therefore, reprogramming the mitochondrial metabolism can serve as a novel and practical approach to repolarize M1 synovial macrophages. The camouflaged meta&#8208;Defensomes are a promising therapeutic agent for impeding OA progression in tclinic.

         <title>Elastic Lattice Enabling Reversible Tetrahedral Li Storage Sites in a High&#8208;Capacity Manganese Oxide Cathode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Li&#8208;excess material based purely on manganese displaying ultrahigh capacities over hundreds of cycles is demonstrated. Through a wealth of characterization methods, it is clarified that Mn migration into the Li layer during the initial cycle stabilizes a large number of tetrahedral sites for extra and reversible Li&#8208;ion storage in this layered compound.








Abstract
The key to breaking through the capacity limitation imposed by intercalation chemistry lies in the ability to harness more active sites that can reversibly accommodate more ions (e.g., Li+) and electrons within a finite space. However, excessive Li&#8208;ion insertion into the Li layer of layered cathodes results in fast performance decay due to the huge lattice change and irreversible phase transformation. In this study, an ultrahigh reversible capacity is demonstrated by a layered oxide cathode purely based on manganese. Through a wealth of characterizations, it is clarified that the presence of low&#8208;content Li2MnO3 domains not only reduces the amount of irreversible O loss; but also regulates Mn migration in LiMnO2 domains, enabling elastic lattice with high reversibility for tetrahedral sites Li&#8208;ion storage in Li layers. This work utilizes bulk cation disorder to create stable Li&#8208;ion&#8208;storage tetrahedral sites and an elastic lattice for layered materials, with a reversible capacity of 600&#160;mA h g&#8722;1, demonstrated in th range 0.6&#8211;4.9&#160;V versus Li/Li+ at 10&#160;mA g&#8722;1. Admittedly, discharging to 0.6&#160;V might be too low for practical use, but this exploration is still of great importance as it conceptually demonstrates the limit of Li&#8208;ions insertion into layered oxide materials.

The fusion of 2D transition&#8208;metal&#8208;dichalcogenide materials with micro/nanomachines can substantially accelerate scientific discovery and engineering implementations for micro/nanorobotics. Here, functional molybdenum disulfide is integrated into Janus micromotors that demonstrate unprecedented performance in response to ion addition and application for water disinfection. The unveiled working mechanism points toward a new scheme for making micro/nanomachines with designed performance.








Abstract
2D&#160;transition&#8208;metal&#8208;dichalcogenide&#160;materials, such as molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) have received immense interest owing to their remarkable structure&#8208;endowed electronic, catalytic, and mechanical properties for applications in optoelectronics, energy storage, and wearable devices. However, 2D materials have been rarely explored in the field of micro/nanomachines, motors, and robots. Here, MoS2&#160;with anatase TiO2&#160;is successfully integrated into an original one&#8208;side&#8208;open hollow micromachine, which demonstrates increased light absorption of TiO2&#8208;based micromachines to the visible region and the first observed motion acceleration in response to ionic media. Both experimentation and theoretical analysis suggest the unique type&#8208;II bandgap alignment of MoS2/TiO2&#160;heterojunction that accounts for the observed unique locomotion owing to a competing propulsion mechanism. Furthermore, by leveraging the chemical properties of MoS2/TiO2, the micromachines achieve sunlight&#8208;powered water disinfection with 99.999%&#160;Escherichia coli&#160;lysed in an&#160;hour. This research suggests abundant opportunities offered by 2D materials in the creation of a new class of micro/nanomachines and robots.

         <title>Stable Solid Electrolyte Interphase In Situ Formed on Magnesium&#8208;Metal Anode by using a Perfluorinated Alkoxide&#8208;Based All&#8208;Magnesium Salt Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A perfluorinated alkoxide&#8208;based all&#8208;magnesium salt electrolyte is designed and synthesized. The proper lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy level of the [Mg(pftb)3]&#8722; anions in the electrolyte enables in situ formation of a stable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) on Mg anodes. With the protection of SEI, Mg//Mg cells achieve low overpotentials over ultralong&#8208;cycle lives of 8100, 3000, and 1500 h at current densities of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, respectively.








Abstract
Passivation of the Mg anode surface in conventional electrolytes constitutes a critical issue for practical Mg batteries. In this work, a perfluorinated tert&#8208;butoxide magnesium salt, Mg(pftb)2, is codissolved with MgCl2 in tetrahydrofuran (THF) to form an all&#8208;magnesium salt electrolyte. Raman spectroscopy and density function theory calculation confirm that [Mg2Cl3&#183;6THF]+[Mg(pftb)3]&#8722; is the main electrochemically active species of the electrolyte. The proper lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy level of the [Mg(pftb)3]&#8722; anion enables in situ formation of a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on Mg anodes. A detailed analysis of the SEI reveals that its stability originates from a dual&#8208;layered organic/inorganic hybrid structure. Mg//Cu and Mg//Mg cells using the electrolyte achieve a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.7% over 3000 cycles, and low overpotentials over ultralong&#8208;cycle lives of 8100, 3000, and 1500 h at current densities of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, respectively. The robust SEI layer, once formed on a Mg electrode, is also shown highly effective in suppressing side&#8208;reactions in a TFSI&#8722;&#8208;containing electrolyte. A high Coulombic efficiency of 99.5% over 800 cycles is also demonstrated for a Mg//Mo6S8 full cell, showing great promise of the SEI forming electrolyte in future Mg batteries.

         <title>Fabrication of Arrays of Topological Solitons in Patterned Chiral Liquid Crystals for Real&#8208;Time Observation of Morphogenesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topological solitons of chiral liquid crystal (LC) are uniformly generated over a large area with periodic air pockets. Controlled thermal phase transition with air pockets enables real&#8208;time observation of morphogenesis of topological solitons transformed from topological defects. The platform provides insight into topological solitons at the other scales and can be applied to multiple applications requiring controlled LC structures.








Abstract
Topological solitons have knotted continuous field configurations embedded in a uniform background, and occur in cosmology, biology, and electromagnetism. However, real&#8208;time observation of their morphogenesis and dynamics is still challenging because their size and timescale are enormously large or tiny. Liquid crystal (LC) structures are promising candidates for a model&#8208;system to study the morphogenesis of topological solitons, enabling direct visualization due to the proper size and timescale. Here, a new&#160;way is found to rationalize the real&#8208;time observation of the generation and transformation of topological solitons using cholesteric LCs confined in patterned substrates. The experimental demonstration shows the topologically protected structures arise via the transformation of topological defects. Numerical modeling based on minimization of free energy closely reconstructs the experimental findings. The fundamental insights obtained from the direct observations pose new theoretical challenges in understanding the morphogenesis of different types of topological solitons within a broad range of scales.

         <title>Tailoring Materials for Epilepsy Imaging: From Biomarkers to Imaging Probes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Excising epileptic foci (EF) is the most efficient approach for treating drug&#8208;resistant epilepsy (DRE). However, owing to the vast heterogeneity of epilepsies, EF in one&#8208;third of patients cannot be accurately located, even after exhausting all current diagnostic strategies. Therefore, identifying biomarkers that truly represent the status of epilepsy and fabricating probes with high targeting specificity are prerequisites for identifying the &#8220;concealed&#8221; EF. However, no systematic summary of this topic has been published. In this paper, we first summarize the potential biomarkers of EF and classify them into three categories: functional, molecular, and structural aberrances during epileptogenesis, a procedure of non&#8208;epileptic brain biasing toward epileptic tissue. The materials used to fabricate these imaging probes and their performance in defining the EF in preclinical and clinical studies are highlighted. Finally, the perspectives for developing the next generation of probes and their challenges in clinical translation are discussed. In general, this review will be helpful in guiding the development of imaging probes defining EF with improved accuracy and holds promise for increasing the number of DRE patients who are eligible for surgical intervention.

         <title>Hexagonal Boron Nitride for Next&#8208;Generation Photonics and Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN), an insulating two&#8208;dimensional (2D) layered material, has recently attracted tremendous interest motivated by the extraordinary properties it shows across the fields of optoelectronics, quantum optics, and electronics, being exotic material platforms for various applications. At an early stage of h&#8208;BN research, it has been explored as an ideal substrate and insulating layers for other 2D materials due to its atomically flat surface free of dangling bonds and charged impurities, and high thermal conductivity. Recent discoveries of structural and optical properties of h&#8208;BN have expanded potential applications into emerging electronics and photonics fields. h&#8208;BN shows a very efficient deep&#8208;ultraviolet band&#8208;edge emission despite its indirect bandgap nature, as well as stable room temperature single&#8208;photon emission over a wide wavelength range, showing a great potential for next&#8208;generation photonics. In addition, h&#8208;BN is extensively being adopted as active media for low energy electronics, including nonvolatile resistive switching memory, radio&#8208;frequency devices, and low dielectric constant materials for next&#8208;generation electronics.

         <title>Memristors&#8208;based Dendritic Neuron for High&#8208;Efficiency Spatial&#8208;Temporal Information Processing</title>

Abstract
Diverse microscopic ionic dynamics help mediate the ability of a biological neural network to handle complex tasks with low energy consumption. Thus, rich internal ionic dynamics in transition metal oxide&#8208;based memristors are expected to provide a unique and useful platform for implementing energy&#8208;efficient neuromorphic computing. To this end, a TiOx&#8208;based interface&#8208;type dynamic memristor and an NbOx&#8208;based Mott memristor are integrated as an artificial dendrite and spike&#8208;firing soma, respectively, to construct a dendritic neuron unit for realizing high&#8208;efficiency spatial&#8208;temporal information processing. Further, a dendritic neural network is hardware implemented for spatial&#8208;temporal information processing to highlight the computational advantages achieved by incorporating dendritic functions in the network. Human motion recognition is demonstrated using the NUT&#8208;RGB dataset as a benchmark spatial&#8208;temporal task; it shows a nearly 20% improvement in accuracy for the memristors&#8208;based hardware incorporating dendrites and a 1000&#215; advantage in power efficiency compared to that of the GPU. The dendritic neuron developed in this study can be considered a critical building block for implementing more bio&#8208;plausible neural networks that can manage complex spatial&#8208;temporal tasks with high efficiency.

         <title>Greenificated Molecularly Imprinted Materials for Advanced Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Molecular imprinting technology (MIT) produces artificial binding sites with precise complementarity to substrates and thereby is capable of exquisite molecular recognition. Over five decades of evolution, it was predicted that the resulting host imprinted materials would overtake natural receptors for research and application purposes, but in practice, this has not yet been realized due to the unsustainability of their life cycles (i.e., precursors, creation, use, recycling, and end&#8208;of&#8208;life). To address this issue, greenificated molecularly imprinted polymers (GMIPs) are a new class of plastic antibodies that have approached sustainability by following one or more of the greenification principles, while also demonstrating more far&#8208;reaching applications compared to their natural counterparts. In this review, we survey the most recent developments in the delicate design and advanced application of GMIPs in six fast&#8208;growing and emerging fields, namely biomedicine/therapy, catalysis, energy harvesting/storage, nanoparticle detection, gas sensing/adsorption, and environmental remediation. In addition, we highlight their distinct features, and discuss the optimal means to utilize these features for attaining incredibly far&#8208;reaching applications. Importantly, the obscure technical challenges of the greenificated MIT are revealed, and conceivable solutions are offered. Lastly, several perspectives on future research directions are proposed.

         <title>Lasing Action from Quasi&#8208;propagating Modes</title>

Abstract
Band edges at the high symmetry points in reciprocal space of periodic structures hold special interest in materials engineering for their high density of states. In optical metamaterials, standing waves found at these points have facilitated lasing, bound&#8208;states&#8208;in&#8208;the&#8208;continuum, and Bose&#8208;Einstein condensation. However, because high symmetry points by definition are localized, properties associated with them are limited to specific energies and wavevectors. Conversely, quasi&#8208;propagating modes along high symmetry directions are predicted to enable similar phenomena over a continuum of energies and wavevectors. Here we&#160;show quasi&#8208;propagating modes in 2D nanoparticle lattices can support lasing action over a continuous range of wavelengths and symmetry&#8208;determined directions from a single device. Using lead halide perovskite nanocrystal films as gain materials, we&#160;achieved lasing from waveguide&#8208;surface lattice resonance (W&#8208;SLR) modes that can be decomposed into propagating waves along high symmetry directions and standing waves in the orthogonal direction that provide optical feedback. We&#160;analyzed the characteristics of the lasing beams using an analytical 3D model that describes diffracted light in 2D lattices. Demonstrations of lasing across different wavelengths and lattice designs highlight how quasi&#8208;propagating modes offer possibilities to engineer chromatic multi&#8208;beam emission important in hyperspectral 3D sensing, high bandwidth Li&#8208;Fi communication, and laser projection displays.

         <title>Composition Engineering of Amorphous Nickel Boride Nanoarchitectures Enabling Highly Efficient Electrosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Developing advanced electrocatalysts with exceptional two electron (2e&#8211;) selectivity, activity and stability are crucial for driving oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Herein, a composition engineering strategy has been adapted to flexibly regulate the intrinsic activity of amorphous nickel boride nanoarchitectures for efficient 2e&#8211; ORR by oriented reduction of Ni2+ with different amounts of BH4&#8211;. Among borides, the amorphous NiB2 delivers the 2e&#8211; selectivity close to 99% at 0.4&#160;V and over 93% in a wide potential range, together with a negligible activity decay under prolonged time. Notably, an ultrahigh H2O2 production rate of 4.753&#160;mol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 has been achieved upon assembling NiB2 in the practical gas diffusion electrode. The combination of X&#8208;ray absorption and in situ Raman spectroscopy, as well as transient photovoltage measurements with density functional theory unequivocally reveal that the atomic ratio between Ni and B induces the local electronic structure diversity, allowing optimization of the adsorption energy of Ni towards *OOH and reducing the interfacial charge transfer kinetics to inhibit the formation of O&#8208;O.

         <title>Diammonium&#8208;Mediated Perovskite Film Formation for High&#8208;Luminescence Red Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;luminance red perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) are enabled by diammonium&#8208;mediated perovskite formation. The diammonium halide promotes the formation of stable bromide&#8208;rich quasi&#8208;2D phases at the surface of 3D perovskites, leading to efficient defect passivation, suppression of ion migration, and reduced lattice strain. The optimized PeLEDs exhibit a record luminance (&gt;105 cd m&#8722;2) and half&#8208;lifetime (&gt;15 h) among red&#8208;emissive 3D PeLEDs.








Abstract
3D mixed&#8208;halide perovskite&#8208;based red emitters combine excellent charge&#8208;transport characteristics with simple solution processing and good film formation; however, light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) based on these emitters cannot yet outperform their nanocrystal counterparts. Here the use of diammonium halides in regulating the formation of mixed bromide&#8211;iodide perovskite films is explored. It is found that the diammonium cations preferentially bond to Pb&#8211;Br, rather than Pb&#8211;I, octahedra, promoting the formation of quasi&#8208;2D phases. It is proposed that the perovskite formation is initially dominated by the crystallization of the thermodynamically more favorable 3D phase, but, as the solution gets depleted from the regular A cations, thin shells of amorphous quasi&#8208;2D perovskites form. This leads to crystalline perovskite grains with efficiently passivated surfaces and reduced lattice strain. As a result, the diammonium&#8208;treated perovskite LEDs demonstrate a record luminance (10745&#160;cd m&#8722;2) and half&#8208;lifetime among 3D perovskite&#8208;based red LEDs.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Broadband Strong Electromagnetic Interference Shielding with Ferromagnetic Graphene Quartz Fabric</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel broadband, strong electromagnetic intereference (EMI) shielding response fabric based on highly structured ferromagnetic graphene quartz fibers is demonstrated, which combines high conductivity and ferromagnetism to attain a synergistic effect for EMI shielding and electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorption, along with the specific woven superstructure of the fabric to introduce the additional multiple reflections and multichannel absorption of EMWs.








Abstract
Flexible electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding materials with ultrahigh shielding effectiveness (SE) are highly desirable for high&#8208;speed electronic devices to attenuate radiated emissions. For hindering interference of their internal or external EMI fields, however, a metallic enclosure suffers from relatively low SE, band&#8208;limited anti&#8208;EMI responses, poor corrosion resistance, and non&#8208;adaptability to the complex geometry of a given circuit. Here, a broadband, strong EMI shielding response fabric is demonstrated based on a highly structured ferromagnetic graphene quartz fiber (FGQF) via a modulation&#8208;doped chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth process. The precise control of the graphitic N&#8208;doping configuration endows graphene coatings on specifically designable quartz fabric weave with both high conductivity (3906 S&#160;cm&#8722;1) and high magnetic responsiveness (a saturation magnetization of &#8776;0.14 emu&#160;g&#8722;1 under 300 K), thus attaining synergistic effect of EMI shielding and electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorption for broadband anti&#8208;EMI technology. The large&#8208;scale durable FGQF exhibits extraordinary EMI SE of &#8776;107&#160;dB over a broadband frequency (1&#8211;18&#160;GHz), by configuring &#8776;20&#160;nm&#8208;thick graphene coatings on a millimeter&#8208;thick quartz fabric. This work enables the potential for development of an industrial&#8208;scale, flexible, lightweight, durable, and ultra&#8208;broadband strong shielding material in advanced applications of flexible anti&#8208;electronic reconnaissance, antiradiation, and stealthy technologies.

         <title>An All&#8208;Organic Self&#8208;Powered Photodetector with Ultraflexible Dual&#8208;Polarity Output for Biosignal Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An all&#8208;organic self&#8208;powered photodetector with ultraflexibility and dual&#8208;polarity output is successfully fabricated by an all&#8208;solution method, which is expected to have great application potential in realizing multifunctional, portable, and wearable electronic devices.








Abstract
Endowing photodetectors with mechanically flexibility and actual functionality are current research issues in developing optoelectronic devices. However, rigid metal&#8208;based or metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;based electrodes remain a block to the realization of ultraflexible electronics. Thus, an ultraflexible all&#8208;organic photodetector (all&#8208;OPD) is designed by innovatively introducing symmetrical organic electrodes PH1000/PH1000 to substitute the widely applied indium&#8208;doped tin oxide (ITO)/Ag electrodes. Specifically, this all&#8208;OPD exhibits a high self&#8208;powered responsivity (R) of over 100&#160;mA W&#8722;1 among 500&#8211;600&#160;nm and the photocurrent remains about 80% of the original performance after being bent 20&#160;000 circles, and can output steady biosignals for photo&#8208;plethysmography (PPG) application. More importantly, this all&#8208;OPD outputs dual&#8208;polarity photocurrent as it is flipped or folded. Benefitting from the ordered phase distribution and designed Schottky barrier heights, the photogenerated holes will be transferred and collected by nearer electrode, while electrons will be trapped in the thick bulk heterojunction (BHJ) as a result of the long channel. This work offers a new avenue toward developing a multifunctional and ultraflexible all&#8208;OPD with a straightforward all&#8208;solution method, and it is expected to be more compatible in complex application scenarios.

         <title>Blading of Conformal Electron&#8208;Transport Layers in p&#8211;i&#8211;n Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
All the reported perovskite modules have a combination of different deposition methods for the perovskites and the charge&#8208;transport layers, which limits high&#8208;throughput module production. A combination of any amine molecules and 4&#8208;(2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;N,N&#8208;dimethylbenzenamine (N&#8208;DMBI) added in phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) allows the electrically conductive PCBM layers to conformally cover the perovskites and achieve high&#8208;efficiency&#160;PSCs and modules with all&#8208;bladed perovskite and charge&#8208;transport layers.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are promising to reduce the cost of photovoltaic system due to their low&#8208;cost raw materials and high&#8208;throughput solution process; however, fabrication of&#160;all the active layers in perovskite modules using a scalable solution process has not yet been demonstrated. Herein, the fabrication of highly efficient PSCs and modules in ambient conditions is reported, with all layers bladed except the metal electrode, by blading a 36&#160;&#177;&#160;9&#160;nm&#8208;thick electron&#8208;transport layer (ETL) on perovskite films with a roughness of &#8776;80&#160;nm. A combination of additives in phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) allows the PCBM to conformally cover the perovskites and still have a good electrical conductivity. Amine&#8208;functionalized molecules are added to enhance both the dispersity of PCBM and the affinity to perovskites. A PCBM dopant of 4&#8208;(2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;N,N&#8208;dimethylbenzenamine (N&#8208;DMBI) recovers the conductivity loss induced by the small amine molecules. PSCs (0.08 cm2) fabricated by the all&#8208;blading process reache an average efficiency of 22.4&#160;&#177;&#160;0.5%&#160;and a champion efficiency of 23.1% for perovskites with a bandgap of 1.51&#160;eV, with much better stability compared to evaporated ETL PSCs. The all&#8208;bladed minimodule (25.03 cm2) shows an aperture efficiency of &#8776;19.3%, showing the good uniformity of the bladed ETLs.

         <title>Zwitterion&#8208;functionalized SnO2 Substrate Induced Sequential Deposition of Black Phase FAPbI3 with Rearranged PbI2 Residue</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Black phase formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) with narrow band gap and high thermal stability has emerged as the most promising candidate for highly efficient and stable perovskite photovoltaics. In order to overcome the intrinsic difficulty of black phase crystallization and to eliminate the PbI2 residue, most sequential deposition methods of FAPbI3&#8208;based perovskite would introduce external ions like methylammonium (MA+), cesium (Cs+), and bromide (Br&#8211;) ions to the perovskite structure of the light absorbing layer. Here we introduce a zwitterion&#8208;functionalized SnO2 as the electron transport layer (ETL) to induce the crystallization of high quality black phase FAPbI3 on such SnO2 substrate. The SnO2 ETL treated with the zwitterion, formamidine sulfinic acid (FSA), can help rearrange the stack direction, orientation and distribution of residual PbI2 in perovskite layer, which reduces the side effect of the residual PbI2 to the perovskite structure. Besides, the FSA functionalization also modifies SnO2 ETL to suppress the deep&#8208;level defects at the perovskite/SnO2 interface. As a result, the FSA&#8208;FAPbI3 based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) exhibit an excellent power conversion efficiency up to 24.1% with 1000 h long&#8208;term operational stability, which is among the highest values for FAPbI3 PSCs fabricated from sequential deposition. Our findings provide a new interface engineering strategy on the sequential fabrication of black phase FAPbI3 PSCs with improved optoelectronic performance.

         <dc:description>
Abstract
Design and fabrication of macroscopic functional devices by molecular engineering is an emerging and effective strategy in exploration of advanced materials. Photo&#8208;responsive overcrowded alkene&#8208;based molecular motor (OAMM) has been considered as one of the most promising molecular machines due to the unique rotary motion driven by light with high temporal and spatial precision. Amplifying the molecular rotary motions into macroscopic behaviors of photo&#8208;directed systems links the molecular dynamics with macroscopic motions of materials, providing new opportunities to design novel materials and devices with a bottom&#8208;up strategy. In this review, we will summarize recent developments of the light&#8208;responsive liquid crystal system triggered by OAMM. The mechanism of amplification effect of liquid crystal matrix will be introduced firstly. Then progress of the OAMM&#8208;driven liquid crystal materials will be described including light&#8208;controlled photonic crystals, texture&#8208;tunable liquid crystal coating and micro&#8208;spheres, photo&#8208;actuated soft robots and dynamic optical devices. We hope that this review provides inspirations in design and exploration of light&#8208;driven soft matters and novel functional materials from molecular engineering to structural modification.

         <title>Fabrication and Functionality Integration Technologies for Small&#8208;scale Soft Robots</title>

Abstract
Small&#8208;scale soft robots have been attracting increasing interest for visible and potential applications owing to their safety and tolerance resulting from their intrinsic soft bodies or compliant structures. However, it is not sufficient that the soft bodies merely provide support or system protection. More importantly, to meet the increasing demands of controllable operation and real&#8208;time feedback in unstructured/complicated scenarios, these robots are required to perform simplex and multimodal functionalities for sensing, communicating and interacting with external environments during large or dynamic deformation with the risk of mismatch or delamination. Challenges are encountered during fabrication and integration, including the selection and fabrication of composite/materials and structures, integration of active/passive functional modules with robust interfaces, particularly with highly deformable soft/stretchable bodies. In this review, methods and strategies of fabricating structural soft bodies and integrating them with functional modules for developing small&#8208;scale soft robots are investigated. Utilizing templating, 3D printing, transfer printing and swelling, small&#8208;scale soft robots can be endowed with several perceptual capabilities corresponding to diverse stimulus, such as light, heat, magnetism and force. The integration of sensing and functionalities effectively enhances the agility, adaptability and universality of soft robots when applied in various fields, including smart manufacturing, medical surgery, biomimetic and other interdisciplinary sciences.

         <title>Structural Regulation of Coupled Phthalocyanine&#8211;Porphyrin Covalent Organic Frameworks to Highly Active and Selective Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In coupled phthalocyanine&#8211;porphyrin covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with cobalt(II) phthalocyanine as the electrocatalytic active site, the Type 1:2 COF (CoPc&#8208;2H2Por) with larger pore size and conjugation structure can more effectively boost CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) activity with lower overpotential than the Type 1:1 COF (CoPc&#8208;H2Por) due to the better mass transfer, faster electron transfer, and reaction kinetics, revealing the important role of electrocatalyst microstructure in the CO2RR.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been applied as potential electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) due to their adjustable architecture and porous feature. Herein, tetraanhydrides of 2,3,9,10,16,17,23,24&#8208;octacarboxyphthalocyanine cobalt(II) (CoTAPc) are used as nodes to couple with 5,15&#8208;di(4&#8208;aminophenyl)&#8208;10,20&#8208;diphenylporphyrin (DAPor) or 5,15,10,20&#8208;tetrayl(4&#8208;aminophenyl)porphyrin (TAPor) via imidization reaction to fabricate novel coupled phthalocyanine&#8211;porphyrin Type 1:2 (CoPc&#8208;2H2Por) or Type 1:1 (CoPc&#8208;H2Por) COFs. Electrocatalytic CO2RR experiments show that both Type 1:2 and Type 1:1 COFs exhibit the maximum Faraday efficiency over 90% with high stability, while the Type 1:2 COF (CoPc&#8208;2H2Por) delivers lower overpotential, higher current density, and CO selectivity than Type 1:1 COF (CoPc&#8208;H2Por) and CoPc monomer. Theoretical and experimental results reveal that the better CO2RR activity of CoPc&#8208;2H2Por than CoPc&#8208;H2Por can be attributed to its larger pore size and conjugate structure, which then cause more efficient electron transfer, adsorption/activation of CO2, faster mass transfer, and reaction kinetics. This work provides a new idea in the structural design of COF&#8208;based electrocatalyst for efficient CO2RR.

         <title>Highly Curved, Quasi&#8208;Single&#8208;Crystalline Mesoporous Metal Nanoplates Promote C&#63743;C Bond Cleavage in Ethanol Oxidation Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly curved, 2D, quasi&#8208;single&#8208;crystalline mesoporous metal nanoplates are precisely synthesized by a facile solution route. The product features multiple structural and compositional advantages, which synergistically promote&#160;C&#63743;C bond cleavage and enable superior electrocatalytic performance in ethanol electrooxidation.








Abstract
The ability to manipulate metal nanocrystals with well&#8208;defined morphologies and structures is greatly important in material chemistry, catalysis chemistry, nanoscience, and nanotechnology. Although 2D metals serve as interesting platforms, further manipulating them in solution with highly penetrated mesopores and ideal crystallinity remains a huge challenge. Here, an easy yet powerful synthesis strategy for manipulating the mesoporous structure and crystallinity of 2D metals in a controlled manner with cetyltrimethylammonium chloride as the mesopore&#8208;forming surfactant and extra iodine&#8208;ion as the structure/facet&#8208;selective agent is reported. This strategy allows for preparing an unprecedented type of 2D quasi&#8208;single&#8208;crystalline mesoporous nanoplates (SMPs) with highly curved morphology and controlled metal composition. The products, for example, PdCu SMPs, feature abundant undercoordinated sites, optimized electronic structures, excellent electron/mass transfers, and confined mesopore environments. Curved PdCu SMPs exhibit remarkable electrocatalytic activity of 6.09&#160;A&#160;mgPd&#8722;1 and stability for ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) compared with its counterpart catalysts and commercial Pd/C. More importantly, PdCu SMPs are highly selective for EOR electrocatalysis that dramatically promotes C&#8211;C bond cleavage with a superior C1 pathway selectivity as high as 72.1%.

         <title>Perception&#8208;to&#8208;Cognition Tactile Sensing Based on Artificial&#8208;Intelligence&#8208;Motivated Human Full&#8208;Skin Bionic Electronic Skin</title>

         <dc:description>
An artificial intelligence (AI)&#8208;motivated full&#8208;skin bionic (FSB) e&#8208;skin based on vertically integrated triboelectric e&#8208;skin and supercapacitive iontronic e&#8208;skin is proposed through the mimicry of skin structures including human vellus hair, epidermis&#8211;dermis&#8211;hypodermis. Assisted by the AI&#8208;motivated &#8220;brain,&#8221; the proposed FSB e&#8208;skin can promote the function of tactile perception to advanced intelligent tactile cognition.








Abstract
Traditional electronic skin (e&#8208;skin), due to the lack of human&#8208;brain&#8208;like thinking and judging capability, is powerless to accelerate the pace to the intelligent era. Herein, artificial intelligence (AI)&#8208;motivated full&#8208;skin bionic (FSB) e&#8208;skin consisting of the structures of human vellus hair, epidermis&#8211;dermis&#8211;hypodermis, is proposed. Benefiting from the double interlocked layered microcone structure and supercapacitive iontronic effect, the FSB e&#8208;skin exhibits ultrahigh sensitivity of 8053.1 kPa&#8722;1 (&lt;1&#160;kPa), linear sensitivity of 3103.5 kPa&#8722;1 (1&#8211;34&#160;kPa), and fast response/recovery time of &lt;5.6&#160;ms. In addition, it can realize the evolution from tactile perception to advanced intelligent tactile cognition after being equipped with a &#8220;brain&#8221;. First, static/dynamic contactless tactile perception is achieved based on the triboelectric effect of the vellus hair bionics. Second, the supercapacitive iontronic effect based structural bionics of the epidermis&#8211;dermis&#8211;hypodermis and a five&#8208;layer multilayer perception (MLP) enable the general intelligent tactile cognition of gesture cognition and robot interaction. Most importantly, by making full use of the FSB e&#8208;skin with a six&#8208;layer MLP neural network, an advanced intelligent material cognition system is developed for real&#8208;time cognition of the object material species and locations via one contact, which surpasses the capability of humans.

Benefiting from the double interlocked layered microcone structure and supercapacitive iontronic effect, the FSB e-skin exhibits ultrahigh sensitivity of 8053.1 kPa&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (&amp;lt;1&#160;kPa), linear sensitivity of 3103.5 kPa&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (1&#8211;34&#160;kPa), and fast response/recovery time of &amp;lt;5.6&#160;ms. In addition, it can realize the evolution from tactile perception to advanced intelligent tactile cognition after being equipped with a &#8220;brain&#8221;. First, static/dynamic contactless tactile perception is achieved based on the triboelectric effect of the vellus hair bionics. Second, the supercapacitive iontronic effect based structural bionics of the epidermis&#8211;dermis&#8211;hypodermis and a five-layer multilayer perception (MLP) enable the general intelligent tactile cognition of gesture cognition and robot interaction. Most importantly, by making full use of the FSB e-skin with a six-layer MLP neural network, an advanced intelligent material cognition system is developed for real-time cognition of the object material species and locations via one contact, which surpasses the capability of humans.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Healing of Metal Oxides Assisted by Polymer&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Healing of defects in metal oxide (MeO) coatings occurs through rearrangement of Cl&#8208;decorated MeO particles formed by vapor phase infiltration inside a polymer, segregation at the defect interface, and their subsequent hydrolysis in air.








Abstract
Enabling self&#8208;healing of materials is crucially important for saving resources and energy in numerous emerging applications. While strategies for the self&#8208;healing of polymers are advanced, mechanisms for semiconducting inorganic materials are scarce due to the lack of suitable healing agents. Here a concept for the self&#8208;healing of metal oxides is developed. This concept consists of metal oxide nanoparticle growth inside the bulk of halogenated polymers and their subsequent entropy&#8208;driven migration to externally induced defect sites, leading to recovery of the defect. Herein, it is demonstrated that the pool of self&#8208;healing materials is expanded to include semiconductors, thereby increasing the reliability and sustainability of functional materials through the use of metal oxides. It is revealed that electrical properties of tin&#8208;doped indium oxide can be partially restored upon healing. Such properties are of immediate interest for the further development of transparent flexible electrodes.

         <title>Sb2Se3 Thin&#8208;Film Solar Cells Exceeding 10% Power Conversion Efficiency Enabled by Injection Vapor Deposition Technology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An injection vapor deposition (IVD) technology is designed and demonstrated. The IVD produces compact antimony selenide (Sb2Se3) films with high orientation preference, fewer deep&#8208;level trap levels, and suppressed non&#8208;radiative recombination, achieving a record power conversion efficiency of 10.12% for Sb2Se3 photovoltaics.








Abstract
Binary Sb2Se3 semiconductors are promising as the absorber materials in inorganic chalcogenide compound photovoltaics due to their attractive anisotropic optoelectronic properties. However, Sb2Se3 solar cells suffer from complex and unconventional intrinsic defects due to the low symmetry of the quasi&#8208;1D crystal structure resulting in a considerable voltage deficit, which limits the ultimate power conversion efficiency (PCE). In this work, the creation of compact Sb2Se3 films with strong [00l] orientation, high crystallinity, minimal deep level defect density, fewer trap states, and low non&#8208;radiative recombination loss by injection vapor deposition is reported. This deposition technique enables superior films compared with close&#8208;spaced sublimation and coevaporation technologies. The resulting Sb2Se3 thin&#8208;film solar cells yield a PCE of 10.12%, owing to the suppressed carrier recombination and excellent carrier transport and extraction. This method thus opens a new and effective avenue for the fabrication of high&#8208;quality Sb2Se3 and other high&#8208;quality chalcogenide semiconductors.

         <title>An Intracellular Self&#8208;Assembly&#8208;Driven Uninterrupted ROS Generator Augments 5&#8208;Aminolevulinic&#8208;Acid&#8208;Based Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the natural biotransformation of 5&#8208;aminolevulinic acid (ALA) (ALA&#8208;PpIX&#8208;heme), an intracellular self&#8208;assembly&#8208;driven uninterrupted reactive oxygen species (ROS) generator (URG) is developed for amplified tumor therapy. The URG can not only generate 1O2 under laser irradiation, but also converts useless heme into peroxidase mimics via intracellular self&#8208;assembly, which can effectively catalyze H2O2 to &#8226;OH, thus realizing &#8220;1O2&#8722;&#8226;OH&#8221; uninterrupted ROS generation.








Abstract
Free radical therapy based on 5&#8208;aminolevulinic acid (ALA, a precursor of the photosensitizer protoporphyrin IX (PpIX)) has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for clinical tumor treatment. However, PpIX can be quickly converted into photoinactive heme, leading to unexpectedly paused production of free radicals and severely hindering its therapeutic benefits. Here, inspired by the natural biotransformation of ALA (ALA&#8208;PpIX&#8208;heme), an uninterrupted reactive oxygen species generator (URG) that converts useless heme to peroxidase mimics via intracellular self&#8208;assembly is developed. The URG is prepared by enwrapping ALA&#8208;loaded polyamide&#8208;amine dendrimers in red blood cell membrane vesicles with a further surface modification of G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;structured AS1411. The URGs realize &#8220;1O2&#8722;&#8226;OH&#8221; uninterrupted generation through &#8220;recycling waste&#8221; in two steps: i) PpIX generates 1O2 under laser irradiation; and ii) the photoinactive metabolite heme self&#8208;assembled with AS1411 to catalyze H2O2 conversion into &#8226;OH. Interestingly, the specific generation of 1O2 in mitochondria and &#8226;OH in nuclei further augments the free&#8208;radical&#8208;induced damage. It is demonstrated that URG can continuously produce free radicals for 6 h postirradiation, and shows 3.3&#8208;times more than that of the nonassembly group, achieving nearly 80% regression of tumors in vivo.

         <title>Systematic Screening and Therapeutic Evaluation of Glyconanoparticles with Differential Cancer Affinities for Targeted Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of 31 types of glyconanoparticles (GlyNPs) with either homogeneous or heterogeneous display of five different sugar moieties (glucose, galactose, mannose, N&#8208;acetyl glucosamine, and N&#8208;acetyl galactosamine) is constructed to identify cancer&#8208;targeting GlyNPs for targeted cancer therapy. GlyNPCD composed of mannose/N&#8208;acetyl glucosamine targets A549 and CT26 tumors, while GlyNPABC composed of glucose/galactose/mannose targets DU145 tumors.








Abstract
Cancer&#8208;targeting ligands used for nanomedicines have been limited mostly to antibodies, peptides, aptamers, and small molecules thus far. Here, a library of glycocalyx&#8208;mimicking nanoparticles as a platform to enable screening and identification of cancer&#8208;targeting nanomedicines is reported. Specifically, a library of 31 artificial glycopolymers composed of either homogeneous or heterogeneous display of five different sugar moieties (&#946;&#8208;glucose, &#946;&#8208;galactose, &#945;&#8208;mannose, &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl glucosamine, and &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl galactosamine) is converted to a library of glyconanoparticles (GlyNPs). GlyNPs optimal for targeting CT26, DU145, A549, and PC3 tumors are systematically screened and identified. The cypate&#8208;conjugated GlyNP displaying &#945;&#8208;mannose and &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl glucosamine show selective targeting and potent photothermal therapeutic efficacy against A549 human lung tumors. The docetaxel&#8208;contained GlyNP displaying &#946;&#8208;glucose, &#946;&#8208;galactose, and &#945;&#8208;mannose demonstrate targeted chemotherapy against DU145 human prostate tumors. The results presented herein collectively demonstrate that the GlyNP library is a versatile platform enabling the identification of cancer&#8208;targeting glyconanoparticles and suggest its potential applicability for targeting various diseased cells beyond cancer.

         <title>Cell&#8208;in&#8208;Catalytic&#8208;Shell Nanoarchitectonics: Catalytic Empowerment of Individual Living Cells by Single&#8208;Cell Nanoencapsulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cell&#8208;in&#8208;catalytic&#8208;shell biohybrid structures are constructed by in situ supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of Fe3+ and benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxylic acid, with concomitant enzyme embedment. The Fe3+&#8208;BTC nanoshells on individual living cells enhance the catalytic efficiency of multienzymatic cascade reactions by confining the reaction intermediates to the internal voids and impart extrinsic functions to the cells beyond the scope of biological evolution.








Abstract
Cell&#8208;in&#8208;shell biohybrid structures, synthesized by encapsulating individual living cells with exogenous materials, have emerged as exciting functional entities for engineered living materials, with emergent properties outside the scope of biochemical modifications. Artificial exoskeletons have, to date, provided physicochemical shelters to the cells inside in the first stage of technological development, and further advances in the field demand catalytically empowered, cellular hybrid systems that augment the biological functions of cells and even introduce completely new functions to the cells. This work describes a facile and generalizable strategy for empowering living cells with extrinsic catalytic capability through nanoencapsulation of living cells with a supramolecular metal&#8211;organic complex of Fe3+ and benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxylic acid (BTC). A series of enzymes are embedded in situ, without loss of catalytic activity, in the Fe3+&#8208;BTC shells, not to mention the superior characteristics of cytocompatible and rapid shell&#8208;forming processes. The nanoshell enhances the catalytic efficiency of multienzymatic cascade reactions by confining reaction intermediates to its internal voids and the nanoencapsulated cells acquire exogenous biochemical functions, including enzymatic cleavage of lethal octyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glucopyranoside into d&#8208;glucose, with autonomous cytoprotection. The system will provide a versatile, nanoarchitectonic tool for interfacing biological cells with functional materials, especially for catalytic bioempowerment of living cells.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Driven Auto&#8208;Detachable Patterning of Flexible Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;shrinkage&#8208;assisted patterning by evaporation&#8221; (SHAPE) method is reported to fabricate freestanding and flexible electrodes. The multimaterial, multilayer, and shape&#8208;designable properties of the SHAPE method for fabrication of flexible electrodes provide electronics with unconfined stacking, customizable stretchability, and conformable integration on arbitrary surfaces, demonstrating their wide spectrum of applications in wearable and 3D integrated electronics.








Abstract
Flexible electrodes that are multilayer, multimaterial, and conformal are pivotal for multifunctional wearable electronics. Traditional electronic circuits manufacturing requires substrate&#8208;supported transfer printing, which limits their multilayer integrity and device conformability on arbitrary surfaces. Herein, a &#8220;shrinkage&#8208;assisted patterning by evaporation&#8221; (SHAPE) method is reported, by employing evaporation&#8208;induced interfacial strain mismatch, to fabricate auto&#8208;detachable, freestanding, and patternable electrodes. The SHAPE method utilizes vacuum&#8208;filtration of polyaniline/bacterial cellulose (PANI/BC) ink through a masked filtration membrane to print high&#8208;resolution, patterned, and multilayer electrodes. The strong interlayer hydrogen bonding ensures robust multilayer integrity, while the controllable evaporative shrinking property of PANI/BC induces mismatch between the strains of the electrode and filtration membrane at the interface and thus autodetachment of electrodes. Notably, a 500&#8208;layer substrateless micro&#8208;supercapacitor fabricated using the SHAPE method exhibits an energy density of 350 mWh cm&#8722;2 at a power density of 40&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, 100 times higher than reported substrate&#8208;confined counterparts. Moreover, a digital circuit fabricated using the SHAPE method functions stably on a deformed glove, highlighting the broad wearable applications of the SHAPE method.

         <title>Delivering Mechanical Stimulation to Cells: State of the Art in Materials and Devices Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biophysical signals, especially mechanical cues, are crucial in many (patho)physiological processes. An overview of the current state of the art in the design and development of materials and devices that can deliver mechanical stimulation to cells and tissues, with a focus on their design principles, is provided, and challenges and perspectives for future research directions are highlighted.








Abstract
Biochemical signals, such as growth factors, cytokines, and transcription factors are known to play a crucial role in regulating a variety of cellular activities as well as maintaining the normal function of different tissues and organs. If the biochemical signals are assumed to be one side of the coin, the other side comprises biophysical cues. There is growing evidence showing that biophysical signals, and in particular mechanical cues, also play an important role in different stages of human life ranging from morphogenesis during embryonic development to maturation and maintenance of tissue and organ function throughout life. In order to investigate how mechanical signals influence cell and tissue function, tremendous efforts have been devoted to fabricating various materials and devices for delivering mechanical stimuli to cells and tissues. Here, an overview of the current state of the art in the design and development of such materials and devices is provided, with a focus on their design principles, and challenges and perspectives for future research directions are highlighted.

         <title>Phonon Symphony of Stacked Multilayers and Weak Bonds Lowers Lattice Thermal Conductivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new chalcogenide, Ga6Cr5Se16, shows intrinsic low lattice thermal conductivity (0.79 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1) at 323 K, which is almost four times lower than that of binary Cr3Se4), or twice lower than that of Cr2Se3 and Ga2Se3. This work provides a comprehensive understanding of the phonon propagation in layered chalcogenides, elucidates a direction for the rational design of multilayer stacking in solids with low &#954;lat.








Abstract
Controlling lattice vibrations to obtain intrinsic low thermal conductivity play a critical role in thermal management of electronic and photonic devices, energy converters, and thermal insulation, which necessitates exploring new compounds and a thorough understanding of their chemical structure, bonding, and lattice dynamics. Herein, a new chalcogenide, Ga6Cr5Se16, shows intrinsic low lattice thermal conductivity &#954;lat, which crystallizes in the monoclinic phase (C2/m) with the stacked inverse GaSe4 layers (g'), close&#8208;packed Cr3+Se6 layers (c), GaSe4 layers (g) and loosely&#8208;stacked Cr2+Se6 layers (c') along the c&#8208;axis. In this structure, a wide variety of chemical bonding is arranged in each layer, such as covalent Ga&#8211;Se, covalent Cr3+&#8211;Se, and weaker Cr2+&#8211;Se bonding, which endow it with a large phonon symphony by strong coupling of soft acoustic and low&#8208;lying optical phonons. As a result, Ga6Cr5Se16 realizes an intrinsic low &#954;lat of 0.79 W m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;1 at 323 K, which is almost four times, or twice lower than that of Cr3Se4 (2.95 W m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;1), or Cr2Se3 (1.56 W m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;1), Ga2Se3 (1.36 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1) at 323 K, respectively. These insights will offer comprehensive understanding of the phonon propagation in complex layered chalcogenides, and&#160;also shed useful light on future design of low&#8208;&#954;lat solids.

         <title>Gas Separations using Nanoporous Atomically Thin Membranes: Recent Theoretical, Simulation, and Experimental Advances</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent development of novel atomically thin 2D materials, including graphene, hexagonal boron nitride, and transition metal dichalcogenides, offers great opportunities for potential breakthroughs in the membrane separation field. Recent research advances, challenges, and potential future directions in the application of nanoporous atomically thin membranes for gas separation are summarized.








Abstract
Porous graphene and other atomically thin 2D materials are regarded as highly promising membrane materials for high&#8208;performance gas separations due to their atomic thickness, large&#8208;scale synthesizability, excellent mechanical strength, and chemical stability. When these atomically thin materials contain a high areal density of gas&#8208;sieving nanoscale pores, they can exhibit both high gas permeances and high selectivities, which is beneficial for reducing the cost of gas&#8208;separation processes. Here, recent modeling and experimental advances in nanoporous atomically thin membranes for gas separations is discussed. The major challenges involved, including controlling pore size distributions, scaling up the membrane area, and matching theory with experimental results, are also highlighted. Finally, important future directions are proposed for real gas&#8208;separation applications of nanoporous atomically thin membranes.

         <title>Carrier&#8208;Transport Mechanism in Organic Antiambipolar Transistors Unveiled by Operando Photoemission Electron Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The carrier transport in an organic antiambipolar transistor (AAT) is examined using operando photoemission electron microscopy. The approach visualizes the conductive electrons under the actual transistor operations and reveals that a lateral p&#8211;n junction is crucial for the negative differential transconductance in the AAT. These results help in enhancing&#160;the device's performance.








Abstract
Organic antiambipolar transistors (AATs) have partially overlapped p&#8211;n junctions. At room temperature, this p&#8211;n junction induces a negative differential transconductance in an AAT. However, the detailed carrier&#8208;transport mechanism remains unclear. Herein, an operando photoemission electron microscopy is used to tackle this issue owing to the technique's ability to visualize conductive electrons in real time during transistor operation. Notably, it is observed that when the AAT is on, a depletion layer forms at the lateral p&#8211;n junction. The visualized depletion layer shows that both p&#8208; and n&#8208;type channels have pinch&#8208;off states in the gate voltage range when the AAT is in on state. The steep potential gradient at the lateral p&#8211;n interface enhances the electron conduction from n&#8208;type to p&#8208;type semiconductor. Another significant finding is that most electrons are considered to recombine with the accumulated holes in the p&#8208;type semiconductor, affording the reduction of photoemission intensity by &#8776;80%. This technique provides a thorough understanding of carrier transport in AATs, further improving the device performance.

         <title>Interface&#8208;Modulated Resistive Switching in Mo&#8208;Irradiated ReS2 for Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile Mo&#8208;irradiation doping is demonstrated for interfacial modulation of resistive switching (RS) in rhenium disulfide (ReS2) memristors, leading to a bipolar non&#8208;volatile switching ratio of nearly two orders of magnitude, programmable multilevel resistance states, and long&#8208;term synaptic plasticity. The device simultaneously achieves a high learning accuracy of 91% in an artificial neural network, demonstrating its potential for neuromorphic computing application.








Abstract
Coupling charge impurity scattering effects and charge&#8208;carrier modulation by doping can offer intriguing opportunities for atomic&#8208;level control of resistive switching (RS). Nonetheless, such effects have remained unexplored for memristive applications based on 2D&#160;materials. Here a facile approach is reported to transform an RS&#8208;inactive rhenium disulfide (ReS2) into an effective switching material through interfacial modulation induced by molybdenum&#8208;irradiation (Mo&#8208;i)&#160;doping. Using ReS2 as a model system, this study unveils a unique RS mechanism based on the formation/dissolution of metallic &#946;&#8208;ReO2 filament across the defective ReS2 interface during the set/reset process. Through simple interfacial modulation, ReS2 of various thicknesses are switchable by modulating the Mo&#8208;irradiation period. Besides, the Mo&#8208;irradiated ReS2 (Mo&#8208;ReS2) memristor further exhibits a bipolar non&#8208;volatile switching ratio of nearly two orders of magnitude, programmable multilevel resistance states, and long&#8208;term synaptic plasticity. Additionally, the fabricated device can achieve a high MNIST learning accuracy of 91% under a non&#8208;identical pulse train. The study's findings demonstrate the potential for modulating RS in RS&#8208;inactive 2D materials via the unique doping&#8208;induced charged impurity scattering property.

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Pressure&#8208;Guided Superhydrophobic Surfaces with Adaptive Adhesion and Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A liquid&#8208;pressure&#8208;guided superhydrophobic surface (LPGSS) is designed by combining soft caps with hard skeletons. LPGSS automatically adjusts its soft cap to achieve a dynamic balance between stability and adhesion through the guidance of liquid pressure. A series of experiments demonstrate that low surface adhesion at moderate pressure and high stability at elevated pressure can be simultaneously achieved on the surface.








Abstract
The dynamic application environments of superhydrophobic surfaces, such as in the manufacturing, chemical, and garment industries, require the fast adaptiveness of the surfaces to their surroundings. Despite the progress in materials and structural design of superhydrophobic surfaces, simultaneously achieving high superhydrophobic stability and low adhesion by traditional design is still challenging. Here, a liquid&#8208;pressure&#8208;guided superhydrophobic surface with self&#8208;adjustable solid&#8211;liquid stability, and adhesion is demonstrated when reacting to the dynamic environmental requirements. To understand the underlying adaptive processes, the liquid impalement dynamics is imaged in three dimensions by confocal microscopy and the stability and superhydrophobicity are measured in varied systems. It is envisioned that the design strategy of liquid&#8208;pressure&#8208;guided superhydrophobic surfaces with dynamic anti&#8208;infiltration capability can stimulate the development of stable superhydrophobicity under complex wetting conditions.

         <title>Polarity&#8208;Differentiated Dielectric Materials in Monolayer Graphene Charge&#8208;Regulated Field&#8208;Effect Transistors for an Artificial Reflex Arc and Pain&#8208;Modulation System of the Spinal Cord</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charge&#8208;regulated field&#8208;effect transistors (CRFETs) with polarity&#8208;differentiated dielectric materials and a monolayer graphene channel are developed to mimic a reflex arc and pain modulation system of the spinal cord. By integrating actuators and memristors with CRFETs, reflex actions and pain sensation under noxious stimuli are realized, offering a new method to emulate the functionalities of the nervous system.








Abstract
The nervous system is a vital part of organisms to survive and it endows them with remarkable abilities, such as perception, recognition, regulation, learning, and decision&#8208;making, by intertwining myriad neurons. To realize such outstanding efficacies and functions, many artificial devices and systems have been investigated to emulate the operating principles of the nervous system. Here, an artificial reflex arc (ARA) and artificial pain modulation system (APMS) are proposed to imitate the unconscious behaviors of the spinal cord. GdxOy&#8208; and AlxOy&#8208;based charge&#8208;regulated field&#8208;effect transistors (CRFETs) with a monolayer graphene channel are fabricated and adopted as inhibitory and excitatory synapses, respectively, under the same pulse signals to mimic the biological reflex arc through a connection with a poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;trifluoroethylene)&#8208;based actuator. Additionally, a memristor is integrated with a CRFET as the interneuron to regulate the Dirac point by controlling the voltage drop on the graphene channel, analogous to the descending pain&#8208;inhibition system in the spinal cord, to prevent excessive pain perception. The proposed ARA and APMS provide a significant step forward to realizing the functions of the nervous system, giving promising potential for developing future intelligent alarm systems, neuroprosthetics, and neurorobotics.

The proposed ARA and APMS provide a significant step forward to realizing the functions of the nervous system, giving promising potential for developing future intelligent alarm systems, neuroprosthetics, and neurorobotics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multichannel Superposition of Grafted Perfect Vortex Beams</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single metasurface is used to generate various grafted perfect vortex beams and realize the coaxial superpositions of these beams in different channels, without relying on the complicated conventional optical setup. A compact metasurface platform can perform a sophisticated task that is nearly impossible with conventional optics, opening opportunities for emerging application areas, such as singular optics and quantum science.








Abstract
Inspired by plant grafting, grafted vortex beams can be formed through grafting two or more helical phase profiles of optical vortex beams. Recently, grafted perfect vortex beams (GPVBs) have attracted much attention due to their unique optical properties and potential applications. However, the current method to generate and manipulate GPVBs requires a complex and bulky optical system, hindering further investigation and limiting its practical applications. Here, a compact metasurface approach for generating and manipulating GPVBs in multiple channels is proposed and demonstrated, which eliminates the need for such a complex optical setup. A single metasurface is utilized to realize various superpositions of GPVBs with different combinations of topological charges in four channels, leading to asymmetric singularity distributions. The positions of singularities in the superimposed beam can be further modulated by introducing an initial phase difference in the metasurface design. The work demonstrates a compact metasurface platform that performs a sophisticated optical task that is very challenging with conventional optics, opening opportunities for the investigation and applications of GPVBs in a wide range of emerging application areas, such as singular optics and quantum science.

         <title>Short&#8208;Range Diffusion Enables General Synthesis of Medium&#8208;Entropy Alloy Aerogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general short&#8208;range diffusion driving strategy for preparing ultralight 3D porous medium entropy aerogels (MEAAs) is proposed to achieve highly efficient methanol oxidation electrocatalysis. The well&#8208;designed MEAAs can be used for a methanol&#8208;oxidation&#8208;assisted water electrolyzer with a low cell voltage of 1.476&#160;V, not only greatly reducing the overpotential of the traditional alkaline water electrolyzer, but also obtaining value&#8208;added formate products at anode.








Abstract
Medium&#8208;entropy alloy aerogels (MEAAs) with the advantages of both multimetallic alloys and aerogels are promising new materials in catalytic applications. However, limited by the immiscible behavior of different metals, achieving single&#8208;phase MEAAs is still a grand challenge. Herein, a general strategy for preparing ultralight 3D porous MEAAs with the lowest density of 39.3 mg cm&#8722;3 among the metal materials is reported, through combining auto&#8208;combustion and subsequent low&#8208;temperature reduction procedures. The homogenous mixing of precursors at the ionic level makes the short&#8208;range diffusion of metal atoms possible to drive the formation of single&#8208;phase MEAAs. As a proof of concept in catalysis, as&#8208;synthesized Ni50Co15Fe30Cu5 MEAAs exhibit a high mass activity of 1.62 A mg&#8722;1 and specific activity of 132.24 mA cm&#8722;2 toward methanol oxidation reactions, much higher than those of the low&#8208;entropy counterparts. In situ Fourier transform infrared and NMR spectroscopies reveal that MEAAs can enable highly selective conversion of methanol to formate. Most importantly, a methanol&#8208;oxidation&#8208;assisted MEAAs&#8208;based water electrolyzer can achieve a low cell voltage of 1.476 V at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 for making value&#8208;added formate at the anode and H2 at the cathode, 173 mV lower than that of traditional alkaline water electrolyzers.

         <title>In Situ Synthesis of MOF&#8208;74 Family for High Areal Energy Density of Aqueous Nickel&#8211;Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of nickel&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) (bi/multimetallic MOF&#8208;74 family) in situ grown on carbon cloth is fabricated in application of aqueous Ni&#8211;Zn batteries. The synthetic strategy based on the coordination effect of metal ions and the concept of binder&#8208;free electrodes provide a new direction for the synthesis of high&#8208;performance materials in the energy&#8208;storage field.








Abstract
Limited by single metal active sites and low electrical conductivity, designing nickel&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) materials with high capacity and high energy density remains a challenge. Herein, a series of bi/multimetallic MOF&#8208;74 family materials in situ grown on carbon cloth (CC) by doping Mx+ ions in Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 is fabricated: NiM&#8208;MOF@CC (M = Mn2+, Co2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Al3+, Fe3+), and NiCoM&#8208;MOF@CC (M = Mn2+, Zn2+, Al3+, Fe3+). The type and ratio of doping metal ions can be adjusted while the original topology is preserved. Different metal ions are confirmed by X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (XAFS). Furthermore, these Ni&#8208;based MOF electrodes are directly utilized as cathodes for aqueous nickel&#8211;zinc batteries (NZBs). Among all the as&#8208;prepared electrodes, NiCo&#8208;MOF@CC&#8208;3 (NCM@CC&#8208;3), with an optimized Co/Ni ratio of 1:1, exhibits the best electrical conductivity, which is according to the density functional theory (DFT) theoretical calculations. The NCM@CC&#8208;3//Zn@CC battery achieves a high specific capacity of 1.77 mAh cm&#8211;2, a high areal energy density of 2.97 mWh cm&#8211;2, and high cycling stability of 83% capacity retention rate after 6000 cycles. The synthetic strategy based on the coordination effect of metal ions and the concept of binder&#8208;free electrodes provide a new direction for the synthesis of high&#8208;performance materials in the energy&#8208;storage field.

         <title>Morphology&#8208;Tuned Pt3Ge Accelerates Water Dissociation to Industrial&#8208;Standard Hydrogen Production over a wide pH Range</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel electrocatalyst, Pt3Ge, engineered with a desired crystallographic facet (202) accelerates the hydrogen production by water electrolysis and records industrially desired operational stability over a wide range of pH compared to the commercial catalyst platinum on carbon. The driving force behind this stupendous performance is envisaged by mapping the reaction mechanism, active sites, and charge&#8208;transfer kinetics in various in situ and ex situ experiments corroborated by the first principles calculations.








Abstract
The discovery of novel materials for industrial&#8208;standard hydrogen production is the present need considering the global energy infrastructure. A novel electrocatalyst, Pt3Ge, which is engineered with a desired crystallographic facet (202), accelerates hydrogen production by water electrolysis, and records industrially desired operational stability compared to the commercial catalyst platinum is introduced. Pt3Ge&#8208;(202) exhibits low overpotential of 21.7 mV (24.6 mV for Pt/C) and 92 mV for 10 and 200 mA cm&#8722;2 current density, respectively in 0.5 m H2SO4. It also exhibits remarkable stability of 15&#160;000 accelerated degradation tests cycles (5000 for Pt/C) and exceptional durability of 500 h (@10 mA cm&#8722;2) in acidic media. Pt3Ge&#8208;(202) also displays low overpotential of 96 mV for 10 mA cm&#8722;2 current density in the alkaline medium, rationalizing its hydrogen production ability over a wide pH range required commercial operations. Long&#8208;term durability (&gt;75 h in alkaline media) with the industrial level current density (&gt;500 mA cm&#8722;2) has been demonstrated by utilizing the electrochemical flow reactor. The driving force behind this stupendous performance of Pt3Ge&#8208;(202) has been envisaged by mapping the reaction mechanism, active sites, and charge&#8208;transfer kinetics via controlled electrochemical experiments, ex situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, in situ infrared spectroscopy, and in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy further corroborated by first principles calculations.

         <title>Construction of N, P Co&#8208;Doped Carbon Frames Anchored with Fe Single Atoms and Fe2P Nanoparticles as a Robust Coupling Catalyst for Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel in situ doping&#8211;adsorption&#8211;phosphidation strategy is discovered for the synthesis of well&#8208;defined Fe single atoms&#8211;Fe2P nanoparticles/N, P co&#8208;doped carbon frames catalyst, and a new concept of &#8220;atomically dispersed Fe&#63743;N4/Fe&#63743;P coupled active centers&#8221; for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction is put forward.








Abstract
A coupling catalyst of highly dispersed N, P co&#8208;doped carbon frames (NPCFs) anchored with Fe single atoms (SAs) and Fe2P nanoparticles (NPs) is synthesized by a novel in situ doping&#8211;adsorption&#8211;phosphatization strategy for the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The optimized Fe SAs&#8208;Fe2P NPs/NPCFs&#8208;2.5 catalyst shows a superior ORR activity and stability in 0.5 m H2SO4 and 0.1 m KOH, respectively. Theoretical calculations reveal a synergistic effect, in that the existence of Fe2P weakens the adsorption of ORR intermediates on active sites and lowers the reaction free energy. The doped P atoms with a strong electron&#8208;donating ability elevate the energy level of Fe&#8208;3d orbitals and facilitate the adsorption of O2. The active Fe atoms exist in a low oxidation state and are less positively charged, and they serve as an electron reservoir capable of donating and releasing electrons, thus improving the ORR activity. Operando and in situ characterization results indicate that the atomically dispersed Fe&#63743;N4/Fe&#63743;P coupled active centers in the Fe SAs&#8208;Fe2P NPs/NPCFs&#8208;2.5 catalyst are characteristic of the different catalytic mechanisms in acidic and alkaline media. This work proposes a novel idea for constructing coupling catalysts with atomic&#8208;level precision and provides a strong reference for the development of high&#8208;efficiency ORR electrocatalysts for practical application.
