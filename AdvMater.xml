      <title>Closest Packing Polymorphism Interfaced Metastable Transition Metal for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution</title>
      <dc:description>
A closest packing polymorphism interface is constructed between metastable hexagonal&#8208;close&#8208;packed phase and its stable counterpart (face&#8208;centered cubic) in a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalyst, promoting the catalytic activity and long&#8208;term durability towards the alkaline hydrogen evolution process.








Abstract
Metastable materials are promising because of their catalytic properties, high&#8208;energy structure, and unique electronic environment. However, the unstable nature inherited from the metastability hinders further performance improvement and practical applications of these materials. Herein, this limitation is successfully addressed by constructing an in situ polymorphism interface (inf) between the metastable hexagonal&#8208;close&#8208;packed (hcp) phase and its stable counterpart (face&#8208;centered cubic, fcc) in cobalt&#8211;nickel (CoNi) alloy. Calculations reveal that the interfacial synergism derived from the hcp and fcc phases lowers the formation energy and enhances stability. Consequently, the optimized CoNi&#8208;inf exhibits an exceptionally low potential of 72&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a Tafel slope of 57&#160;mV dec&#8722;1 for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 1.0 m KOH. Furthermore, it is superior to most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based HER catalysts. No noticeable activity decay or structural changes are observed even over 14 h of catalysis. The computational simulation further rationalizes that the interface of CoNi&#8208;inf with a suitable d&#8208;band center provides uniform sites for hydrogen adsorption, leading to a distinguished HER catalytic activity. This work, therefore, presents a new route for designing metastable catalysts for potential energy conversion.

      <title>Tuning the Structural and Optoelectronic Properties of Cs2AgBiBr6 Double&#8208;Perovskite Single Crystals through Alkali&#8208;Metal Substitution</title>
      <dc:description>
The search for nontoxic perovskite materials with long&#8208;term stability provides new opportunities for optoelectronics. Alkali&#8208;substituted compounds based on the double perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6 are scrutinized in terms of their photo&#8208;physical and structural properties. Cation&#8208;substitution entails an enhanced carrier recombination lifetime and, in combination with the tunability in the sensitivity to X&#8208;rays, makes these materials suitable for applications in X&#8208;ray detectors.








Abstract
Lead&#8208;free double perovskites have great potential as stable and nontoxic optoelectronic materials. Recently, Cs2AgBiBr6 has emerged as a promising material, with suboptimal photon&#8208;to&#8208;charge carrier conversion efficiency, yet well suited for high&#8208;energy photon&#8208;detection applications. Here, the optoelectronic and structural properties of pure Cs2AgBiBr6 and alkali&#8208;metal&#8208;substituted (Cs1&#8722;xYx)2AgBiBr6 (Y: Rb+, K+, Na+; x&#160;= 0.02) single crystals are investigated. Strikingly, alkali&#8208;substitution entails a tunability to the material system in its response to X&#8208;rays and structural properties that is most strongly revealed in Rb&#8208;substituted compounds whose X&#8208;ray sensitivity outperforms other double&#8208;perovskite&#8208;based devices reported. While the fundamental nature and magnitude of the bandgap remains unchanged, the alkali&#8208;substituted materials exhibit a threefold boost in their fundamental carrier recombination lifetime at room temperature. Moreover, an enhanced electron&#8211;acoustic phonon scattering is found compared to Cs2AgBiBr6. The study thus paves the way for employing cation substitution to tune the properties of double perovskites toward a new material platform for optoelectronics.

      <title>Printable CsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells with PCE of 19% via an Additive Strategy</title>
      <dc:description>
The development of the first high&#8208;performance, printable CsPbI3 solar cells via an ambient blade&#8208;coating technique is reported. High&#8208;quality CsPbI3 films are grown via the introduction of a low concentration of the multifunctional molecular additive Zn(C6F5)2. As a result, the additive&#8208;treated perovskite solar cell delivers a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19%.








Abstract
All&#8208;inorganic CsPbI3 holds promise for efficient tandem solar cells, but reported fabrication techniques are not transferrable to scalable manufacturing methods. Herein, printable CsPbI3 solar cells are reported, in which the charge transporting layers and photoactive layer are deposited by fast blade&#8208;coating at a low temperature (&#8804;100 &#176;C)&#160;in ambient conditions. High&#8208;quality CsPbI3 films are grown via introducing a low concentration of the multifunctional molecular additive Zn(C6F5)2, which reconciles the conflict between air&#8208;flow&#8208;assisted fast drying and low&#8208;quality film including energy misalignment and trap formation. Material analysis reveals a preferential accumulation of the additive close to the perovskite/SnO2 interface and strong chemisorption on the perovskite surface, which leads to the formation of energy gradients and suppressed trap formation within the perovskite film, as well as a 150 meV improvement of the energetic alignment at the perovskite/SnO2 interface. The combined benefits translate into significant enhancement of the power conversion efficiency to 19% for printable solar cells. The devices without encapsulation degrade only by &#8776;2% after 700 h in air conditions.

      <title>Solution&#8208;Processable Pure Green Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitter Based on the Multiple Resonance Effect</title>
      <dc:description>
A thermally activated delayed fluorescence material featuring multiple resonance effect of boron, nitrogen, and oxygen atoms (OAB&#8208;ABP&#8208;1) is synthesized by one&#8208;shot double borylation. A solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) device using OAB&#8208;ABP&#8208;1 exhibits pure green electroluminescence with a small full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum, and a high external quantum efficiency with minimum efficiency roll&#8208;off.








Abstract
Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials based on the multiple resonance (MR) effect are applied in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), combining high color purity and efficiency. However, they are not fabricated via solution&#8208;processing, which is an economical approach toward the mass production of OLED displays. Here, a solution&#8208;processable MR&#8208;TADF material (OAB&#8208;ABP&#8208;1), with an extended &#960;&#8208;skeleton and bulky substituents, is designed. OAB&#8208;ABP&#8208;1 is synthesized from commercially available starting materials via a four&#8208;step process involving one&#8208;shot double borylation. OAB&#8208;ABP&#8208;1 presents attractive photophysical properties, a narrow emission band, a high photoluminescence quantum yield, a small energy gap between S1 and T1, and low activation energy for reverse intersystem crossing. These properties are attributed to the alternating localization of the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals induced by the boron, nitrogen, and oxygen atoms. Furthermore, to facilitate charge recombination, two novel semiconducting polymers with similar ionization potentials to that of OAB&#8208;ABP&#8208;1 are synthesized for use as interlayer and emissive layer materials. A solution&#8208;processed OLED device is fabricated using OAB&#8208;ABP&#8208;1 and the aforementioned polymers; it exhibits pure green electroluminescence with a small full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum and a high external quantum efficiency with minimum efficiency roll&#8208;off.

      <title>4D&#8208;Printed Transformable Tube Array for High&#8208;Throughput 3D Cell Culture and Histology</title>
      <dc:description>
A 4D&#8208;printed transformable culture tube array (TTA) can directly transfer a large number of 3D culture models from a microwell plate to a histology cassette, enabling rapid and parallel histological analysis. A seamless workflow from cell culture to histological analysis is demonstrated with human neural progenitor cell (hNPC) spheroids cultured in the TTA.








Abstract
3D cell cultures are rapidly emerging as a promising tool to model various human physiologies and pathologies by closely recapitulating key characteristics and functions of in vivo microenvironment. While high&#8208;throughput 3D culture is readily available using multi&#8208;well plates, assessing the internal microstructure of 3D cell cultures still remains extremely slow because of the manual, laborious, and time&#8208;consuming histological procedures. Here, a 4D&#8208;printed transformable tube array (TTA) using a shape&#8208;memory polymer that enables massively parallel histological analysis of 3D cultures is presented. The interconnected TTA can be programmed to be expanded by 3.6 times of its printed dimension to match the size of a multi&#8208;well plate, with the ability to restore its original dimension for transferring all cultures to a histology cassette in order. Being compatible with microtome sectioning, the TTA allows for parallel histology processing for the entire samples cultured in a multi&#8208;well plate. The test result with human neural progenitor cell spheroids suggests a remarkable reduction in histology processing time by an order of magnitude. High&#8208;throughput analysis of 3D cultures enabled by this TTA has great potential to further accelerate innovations in various 3D culture applications such as high&#8208;throughput/content screening, drug discovery, disease modeling, and personalized medicine.

      <title>Zwitterionic 3D&#8208;Printed Non&#8208;Immunogenic Stealth Microrobots</title>
      <dc:description>
Zwitterionic stealth microrobots avoid detection and capture by immune cells. Zwitterionic microrobots with anti&#8208;biofouling, stealth, and non&#8208;immunogenic properties are 3D&#8208;printed via two&#8208;photon&#8208;polymerization, and are functionalized for magnetic actuation, encapsulation of biomolecules, and drug delivery. The microrobots remain undetected by macrophages and other immune cells for at least 90 hours, overcoming a major roadblock in medical microrobotics.








Abstract
Microrobots offer transformative solutions for non&#8208;invasive medical interventions due to their small size and untethered operation inside the human body. However, they must face the immune system as a natural protection mechanism against foreign threats. Here, non&#8208;immunogenic stealth zwitterionic microrobots that avoid recognition from immune cells are introduced. Fully zwitterionic photoresists are developed for two&#8208;photon polymerization 3D microprinting of hydrogel microrobots with ample functionalization: tunable mechanical properties, anti&#8208;biofouling and non&#8208;immunogenic properties, functionalization for magnetic actuation, encapsulation of biomolecules, and surface functionalization for drug delivery. Stealth microrobots avoid detection by macrophage cells of the innate immune system after exhaustive inspection (&gt;90 hours), which has not been achieved in any microrobotic platform to date. These versatile zwitterionic materials eliminate a major roadblock in the development of biocompatible microrobots, and will serve as a toolbox of non&#8208;immunogenic materials for medical microrobot and other device technologies for bioengineering and biomedical applications.

      <title>Biopolymers Derived from Trees as Sustainable Multifunctional Materials: A Review</title>
      <dc:description>
A timely overview of the recent development of materials and structures derived from different parts of trees for sustainability is provided. The relationships between the structure, properties, performance, and applications of components from trees are comprehensively reviewed. A concise introduction of the corresponding chemistry and preparation methods of functional elements from the trees is given.








Abstract
The world is currently transitioning from a fossil&#8208;fuel&#8208;driven energy economy to one that is supplied by more renewable and sustainable materials. Trees as the most abundant renewable bioresource have attracted significant attention for advanced materials and manufacturing in this epochal transition. Trees are composed with complex structures and components such as trunk (stem and bark), leaf, flower, seed, and root. Although many excellent reviews have been published regarding advanced applications of wood and wood&#8208;derived biopolymers in different fields, such as energy, electronics, biomedical, and water treatment, no reviews have revisited and systematically discussed functional materials and even devices derived from trees in a full scope yet. Therefore, a timely summary of the recent development of materials and structures derived from different parts of trees for sustainability is prsented here. A concise introduction to the different parts of the trees is given first, which is followed by the corresponding chemistry and preparation of functional materials using various biopolymers from trees. The most promising applications of biopolymer&#8208;based materials are discussed subsequently. A comprehensive review of the different parts of trees as sustainable functional materials and devices for critical applications is thus provided.

      <title>Time&#8208;Resolved Structural Kinetics of an Organic Mixed Ionic&#8211;Electronic Conductor</title>
      <dc:description>
Time&#8208;resolved operando scattering captures the transient microstructural changes of an organic mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductor in response to dynamic electrochemical potential. The timescales of structural changes related to doping and dedoping are not symmetrical. Combined with spectroelectrochemical measurements, the close relationship between microstructure transients and polaron&#8211;bipolaron population kinetics is revealed.








Abstract
The structure and packing of organic mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductors have an especially significant effect on transport properties. In operating devices, this structure is not fixed but is responsive to changes in electrochemical potential, ion intercalation, and solvent swelling. Toward this end, the steady&#8208;state and transient structure of the model organic mixed conductor, poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS), is characterized using multimodal time&#8208;resolved operando techniques. Steady&#8208;state operando X&#8208;ray scattering reveals a doping&#8208;induced lamellar expansion of 1.6 &#197; followed by 0.4 &#197; relaxation at high doping levels. Time&#8208;resolved operando X&#8208;ray scattering reveals asymmetric rates of lamellar structural change during doping and dedoping that do not directly depend on potential or charging transients. Time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy establishes a link between structural transients and the complex kinetics of electronic charge carrier subpopulations, in particular the polaron&#8211;bipolaron equilibrium. These findings provide insight into the factors limiting the response time of organic mixed&#8208;conductor&#8208;based devices, and present the first real&#8208;time observation of the structural changes during doping and dedoping of a conjugated polymer system via X&#8208;ray scattering.

      <title>Molybdenum Boride as an Efficient Catalyst for Polysulfide Redox to Enable High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Hydrophilic molybdenum boride (MoB) nanoparticles are prepared through a facile solid&#8208;state reaction and employed as an efficient catalytic additive in sulfur cathodes. Benefiting from the appealing properties of MoB, pouch cells fabricated with the MoB additive deliver an ultrahigh discharge capacity of 947 mA h g&#8722;1 over 55 cycles under practically necessary conditions.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries, despite having high theoretical specific energy, possess many practical challenges, including lithium polysulfide (LiPS) shuttling. To address the issues, here, hydrophilic molybdenum boride (MoB) nanoparticles are presented as an efficient catalytic additive for sulfur cathodes. The high conductivity and rich catalytically active sites of MoB nanoparticles allow for a fast kinetics of LiPS redox in high&#8208;sulfur&#8208;loading electrodes (6.1 mg cm&#8722;2). Besides, the hydrophilic properties and good wettability toward electrolyte of MoB can facilitate electrolyte penetration and LiPS redox, guaranteeing a high utilization of sulfur under a lean&#8208;electrolyte condition. Therefore, the cells with MoB achieve impressive electrochemical performance, including a high capacity (1253 mA h g&#8722;1) and ultralong lifespan (1000 cycles) with a low capacity fade rate of 0.03% per cycle. Also, pouch cells fabricated with the MoB additive deliver an ultrahigh discharge capacity of 947 mA h g&#8722;1, corresponding to a low electrolyte&#8208;to&#8208;capacity ratio of about 4.8 &#181;L (mA h)&#8722;1, and remain stable over 55 cycles under practically necessary conditions with a low electrolyte&#8208;to&#8208;sulfur ratio of 4.5 &#181;L mg&#8722;1.

      <title>Optomechanically Actuated Microcilia for Locally Reconfigurable Surfaces</title>
      <dc:description>
Chromium dioxide/poly(dimethylsiloxane) composite micropillars with high aspect&#8208;ratio and magnetic properties are presented. The microcilia can be remotely actuated either collectively or selectively by using magnetic fields and light. Light&#8208;driven local actuation enables this microcilia array to function as reconfigurable and controllably moving subsets.








Abstract
Artificial microcilia structures have shown potential to incorporate actuators in various applications such as microfluidic devices and biomimetic microrobots. Among the multiple possibilities to achieve cilia actuation, magnetic fields present an opportunity given their quick response and wireless operation, despite the difficulty in achieving localized actuation because of their continuous distribution. In this work, a high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio (&gt;8), elastomeric, magnetically responsive microcilia array is presented that allows for wireless, localized actuation through the combined use of light and magnetic fields. The microcilia array can move in response to an external magnetic field and can be locally actuated by targeted illumination of specific areas. The periodic pattern of the microcilia also diffracts light with varying diffraction efficiency as a function of the applied magnetic field, showing potential for wirelessly controlled adaptive optical elements.

      <title>Particulate Alum via Pickering Emulsion for an Enhanced COVID&#8208;19 Vaccine Adjuvant</title>
      <dc:description>
The adjuvant&#8208;effect of the licensed alum adjuvant by particulate alum via Pickering emulsion (PAPE) is exploited toward enhanced COVID&#8208;19 vaccines. PAPE mirrors and &#8220;inherits&#8221; the acknowledged biosafety profile. Additionally, the alum&#8208;packed interphase confers higher affinity for dendritic cell uptake, which provokes the uptake and cross&#8208;presentation of antigens for potent humoral and cellular responses.








Abstract
For rapid response against the prevailing COVID&#8208;19 (coronavirus disease 19), it is a global imperative to exploit the immunogenicity of existing formulations for safe and efficient vaccines. As the most accessible adjuvant, aluminum hydroxide (alum) is still the sole employed adjuvant in most countries. However, alum tends to attach on the membrane rather than entering the dendritic cells (DCs), leading to the absence of intracellular transfer and process of the antigens, and thus limits T&#8208;cell&#8208;mediated immunity. To address this, alum is packed on the squalene/water interphase is packed, forming an alum&#8208;stabilized Pickering emulsion (PAPE). &#8220;Inheriting&#8221; from alum and squalene, PAPE demonstrates a good biosafety profile. Intriguingly, with the dense array of alum on the oil/water interphase, PAPE not only adsorbs large quantities of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) antigens, but also harbors a higher affinity for DC uptake, which provokes the uptake and cross&#8208;presentation of the delivered antigens. Compared with alum&#8208;treated groups, more than six times higher antigen&#8208;specific antibody titer and three&#8208;fold more IFN&#8208;&#947;&#8208;secreting T cells are induced, indicating the potent humoral and cellular immune activations. Collectively, the data suggest that PAPE may provide potential insights toward a safe and efficient adjuvant platform for the enhanced COVID&#8208;19 vaccinations.

Some of the effects that the structure of monomers can have on the interlayer interactions in 2D covalent organic frameworks and related materials are presented.








Abstract
The ability to design and synthesize monomers can affect fundamental aspects in 2D covalent organic frameworks, such as dimensionality, topology, and pore size. Besides this, the structure of the monomers can also affect interlayer interactions, which provide an additional means to influence crystallinity, layer arrangement, interlayer distances, and exfoliability.

      <title>An Efficient Approach to Fabricate Air&#8208;Stable Perovskite Solar Cells via Addition of a Self&#8208;Polymerizing Ionic Liquid</title>
      <dc:description>
The inclusion of a novel in situ polymerizable ionic liquid, 1,3&#8208;bis(4&#8208;vinylbenzyl)imidazolium chloride ([bvbim]Cl), allows perovskite films to be manufactured under humid environments, conferring improved materials quality, higher power conversion efficiency, and long&#8208;term stability.








Abstract
Despite the excellent photovoltaic properties achieved by perovskite solar cells at the laboratory scale, hybrid perovskites decompose in the presence of air, especially at high temperatures and in humid environments. Consequently, high&#8208;efficiency perovskites are usually prepared in dry/inert environments, which are expensive and less convenient for scale&#8208;up purposes. Here, a new approach based on the inclusion of an in situ polymerizable ionic liquid, 1,3&#8208;bis(4&#8208;vinylbenzyl)imidazolium chloride ([bvbim]Cl), is presented, which allows perovskite films to be manufactured under humid environments, additionally leading to a material with improved quality and long&#8208;term stability. The approach, which is transferrable to several perovskite formulations, allows efficiencies as high as 17% for MAPbI3 processed in air % relative humidity (RH) &#8805;30 (from an initial 15%), and 19.92% for FAMAPbI3 fabricated in %RH &#8805;50 (from an initial 17%), providing one of the best performances to date under similar conditions.

      <title>Engineering Macrophages for Cancer Immunotherapy and Drug Delivery</title>
      <dc:description>
Macrophages play important roles in tumor growth and treatment. Strategies to engineer tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) to combat tumors are summarized as follows: inhibiting macrophage recruitment, depleting TAMs, reprograming TAMs, and blocking the CD47&#8208;SIRP&#945; pathway. Furthermore, tumor&#8208;targeting M1 macrophages are used in anti&#8208;cancer drug delivery in three ways: as macrophages, macrophage&#8208;derived exosomes, and macrophage&#8208;coated nanoparticles acting as drug carriers.








Abstract
Macrophages play an important role in cancer development and metastasis. Proinflammatory M1 macrophages can phagocytose tumor cells, while anti&#8208;inflammatory M2 macrophages such as tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) promote tumor growth and invasion. Modulating the tumor immune microenvironment through engineering macrophages is efficacious in tumor therapy. M1 macrophages target cancerous cells and, therefore, can be used as drug carriers for tumor therapy. Herein, the strategies to engineer macrophages for cancer immunotherapy, such as inhibition of macrophage recruitment, depletion of TAMs, reprograming of TAMs, and blocking of the CD47&#8208;SIRP&#945; pathway, are discussed. Further, the recent advances in drug delivery using M1 macrophages, macrophage&#8208;derived exosomes, and macrophage&#8208;membrane&#8208;coated nanoparticles are elaborated. Overall, there is still significant room for development in macrophage&#8208;mediated immune modulation and macrophage&#8208;mediated drug delivery, which will further enhance current tumor therapies against various malignant solid tumors, including drug&#8208;resistant tumors and metastatic tumors.

&lt;p&gt;Macrophages play an important role in cancer development and metastasis. Proinflammatory M1 macrophages can phagocytose tumor cells, while anti&#8208;inflammatory M2 macrophages such as tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) promote tumor growth and invasion. Modulating the tumor immune microenvironment through engineering macrophages is efficacious in tumor therapy. M1 macrophages target cancerous cells and, therefore, can be used as drug carriers for tumor therapy. Herein, the strategies to engineer macrophages for cancer immunotherapy, such as inhibition of macrophage recruitment, depletion of TAMs, reprograming of TAMs, and blocking of the CD47&#8208;SIRP&#945; pathway, are discussed. Further, the recent advances in drug delivery using M1 macrophages, macrophage&#8208;derived exosomes, and macrophage&#8208;membrane&#8208;coated nanoparticles are elaborated. Overall, there is still significant room for development in macrophage&#8208;mediated immune modulation and macrophage&#8208;mediated drug delivery, which will further enhance current tumor therapies against various malignant solid tumors, including drug&#8208;resistant tumors and metastatic tumors.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Realizing Reduced Imperfections via Quantum Dots Interdiffusion in High Efficiency Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
Introduction of multi&#8208;cation hybrid halide perovskite quantum dots reduces ionic defects at the surface and grain boundaries via a solid&#8208;state interdiffusion process. The enhanced moisture and photostability enable power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 21% to be achieved with more than 90% of its initial PCE retained on exposure to continuous illumination of more than 550 h.








Abstract
Realization of reduced ionic (cationic and anionic) defects at the surface and grain boundaries (GBs) of perovskite films is vital to boost the power conversion efficiency of organic&#8211;inorganic halide perovskite (OIHP) solar cells. Although numerous strategies have been developed, effective passivation still remains a great challenge due to the complexity and diversity of these defects. Herein, a solid&#8208;state interdiffusion process using multi&#8208;cation hybrid halide perovskite quantum dots (QDs) is introduced as a strategy to heal the ionic defects at the surface and GBs. It is found that the solid&#8208;state interdiffusion process leads to a reduction in OIHP shallow defects. In addition, Cs+ distribution in QDs greatly influences the effectiveness of ionic defect passivation with significant enhancement to all photovoltaic performance characteristics observed on treating the solar cells with Cs0.05(MA0.17FA0.83)0.95PbBr3 (abbreviated as QDs&#8208;Cs5). This enables power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 21% to be achieved with more than 90% of its initial PCE retained on exposure to continuous illumination of more than 550 h.

      <title>Colloidal Nanosurfactants for 3D Conformal Printing of 2D van der Waals Materials</title>
      <dc:description>
Nanosurfactant&#8208;stabilized 2D material inks are printed conformally on various 2D/3D substrates enabling rapid fabrication of complex device structures with high spatial resolution. Specifically, graphene quantum dot nanosurfactants not only provide electrostatic stabilization for a wide range of 2D materials, but also have become an integrated part of printed devices and result in superior mechanical/optoelectronic properties in 2D&#8208;material&#8208;based devices.








Abstract
Printing techniques using nanomaterials have emerged as a versatile tool for fast prototyping and potentially large&#8208;scale manufacturing of functional devices. Surfactants play a significant role in many printing processes due to their ability to reduce interfacial tension between ink solvents and nanoparticles and thus improve ink colloidal stability. Here, a colloidal graphene quantum dot (GQD)&#8208;based nanosurfactant is reported to stabilize various types of 2D materials in aqueous inks. In particular, a graphene ink with superior colloidal stability is demonstrated by GQD nanosurfactants via the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interaction, leading to the printing of multiple high&#8208;resolution patterns on various substrates using a single printing pass. It is found that nanosurfactants can significantly improve the mechanical stability of the printed graphene films compared with those of conventional molecular surfactant, as evidenced by 100 taping, 100 scratching, and 1000 bending cycles. Additionally, the printed composite film exhibits improved photoconductance using UV light with 400 nm wavelength, arising from excitation across the nanosurfactant bandgap. Taking advantage of the 3D conformal aerosol jet printing technique, a series of UV sensors of heterogeneous structures are directly printed on 2D flat and 3D spherical substrates, demonstrating the potential of manufacturing geometrically versatile devices based on nanosurfactant inks.

      <title>Transparent and Freestanding Single&#8208;Walled Carbon Nanotube Films Synthesized Directly and Continuously via a Blown Aerosol Technique</title>
      <dc:description>
A novel blown aerosol chemical vapor deposition (BACVD) method is reported to continuously produce single&#8208;walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) transparent conductive films (TCFs) at a rate of several hundred meters per hour. With BACVD, both carbon conversion efficiency and SWCNT TCF yield can reach three orders of magnitude higher than those with conventional floating catalyst chemical vapor deposition.








Abstract
Single&#8208;walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) films are promising materials as flexible transparent conductive films (TCFs). Here, inspired by the extrusion blown plastic film technique and the SWCNT synthesis approach by floating catalyst chemical vapor deposition (FCCVD), a novel blown aerosol chemical vapor deposition (BACVD) method is reported to directly and continuously produce freestanding SWCNT TCFs at several hundred meters per hour. The synthesis mechanism, involving blowing a stable aerosol bubble and transforming the bubble into an aerogel, is investigated, and a general phase diagram is established for this method. For the SWCNT TCFs via BACVD, both carbon conversion efficiency and SWCNT TCF yield can reach three orders of magnitude higher than those with the conventional FCCVD. The film displays a sheet resistance of 40&#160;ohm&#160;sq&#8722;1 at 90% transmittance after being doped, representing the record performance based on large&#8208;scale SWCNT films. Transparent, flexible, and stretchable electrodes based on BACVD films are demonstrated. Moreover, this high&#8208;throughput method of producing SWCNT TCFs can be compatible with the roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll process for mass production of flexible displays, touch screens, solar cells, and solid&#8208;state lighting, and is expected to have a broad and long&#8208;term impact on many fields from consumer electronics to energy conversion and generation.

      <title>MoS2/Polymer Heterostructures Enabling Stable Resistive Switching and Multistate Randomness</title>
      <dc:description>
MoS2/polymer heterostructure&#8208;based resistive switching devices are demonstrated. These devices show much improved switching performance, such as low set/reset voltage, high on/off ratio, and device stability during cycle to cycle operation, and thus enable potential applications on random number generation for enhanced cybersecurity.








Abstract
Resistive random&#8208;access memories (ReRAMs) based on transition metal dichalcogenide layers are promising physical sources for random number generation (RNG). However, most ReRAM devices undergo performance degradation from cycle to cycle, which makes preserving a normal probability distribution during operation a challenging task. Here, ReRAM devices with excellent stability are reported by using a MoS2/polymer heterostructure as active layer. The stability enhancement manifests in outstanding cumulative probabilities for both high&#8208; and low&#8208;resistivity states of the memory cells. Moreover, the intrinsic values of the high&#8208;resistivity state are found to be an excellent source of randomness as suggested by a Chi&#8208;square test. It is demonstrated that one of these cells alone can generate ten distinct random states, in contrast to the four conventional binary cells that would be required for an equivalent number of states. This work unravels a scalable interface engineering process for the production of high&#8208;performance ReRAM devices, and sheds light on their promising application as reliable RNGs for enhanced cybersecurity in the big data era.

      <title>Multistate Switching of Photonic Angular Momentum Coupling in Phase&#8208;Change Metadevices</title>
      <dc:description>
Multistate switching of photonic angular momentum coupling, namely, symmetric, asymmetric, and no coupling, is experimentally demonstrated at different crystallization levels of structured GST. In practical applications, coded information can be encrypted in asymmetric mode using the spin degree of freedom, while revealing misleading one without proper phase change or after excessive crystallinity.








Abstract
The coupling between photonic spin and orbital angular momenta is significantly enhanced at the subwavelength scale and has found a plethora of applications in nanophotonics. However, it is still a great challenge to make such kind of coupling tunable with multiple sates. Here, a versatile metasurface platform based on polyatomic phase&#8208;change resonators is provided to realize multiple&#8208;state switching of photonic angular momentum coupling. As a proof of concept, three coupling modes, namely, symmetric coupling, asymmetric coupling, and no coupling, are experimentally demonstrated at three different crystallization levels of structured Ge2Sb2Te5 alloy. In practical applications, coded information can be encrypted in asymmetric mode using the spin degree of freedom, while revealing misleading one without proper phase change or after excessive crystallinity. With these findings, this study may open an exciting direction for subwavelength electromagnetics with unprecedented compactness, allowing to envision applications in active nanophotonics and information security engineering.

      <title>Extremely Rapid Self&#8208;Healable and Recyclable Supramolecular Materials through Planetary Ball Milling and Host&#8211;Guest Interactions</title>
      <dc:description>
Planetary ball milling increases the mobility of polymer chains. The increased mobility helps supramolecule&#8208;like properties to be achieved, as these properties do not appear with low chain mobility. These supramolecular materials have tough mechanical properties, rapid self&#8208;healing properties, and recyclable properties.








Abstract
The host&#8211;guest interaction as noncovalent bonds can make polymeric materials tough and flexible based on the reversibility property, which is a promising approach to extend the lifetime of polymeric materials. Supramolecular materials with cyclodextrin and adamantane are prepared by mixing host polymers and guest polymers by planetary ball milling. The toughness of the supramolecular materials prepared by ball milling is approximately 2 to 5 times higher than that of supramolecular materials prepared by casting, which is the conventional method. The materials maintain their mechanical properties during repeated ball milling treatments. They are also applicable as self&#8208;healable bulk materials and coatings, and they retain the transparency of the substrate. Moreover, fractured pieces of the materials can be re&#8208;adhered within 10 min. Dynamic mechanical analysis, thermal property measurements, small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, and microscopy observations reveal these behaviors in detail. Scars formed on the coating disappear within a few seconds at 60&#160;&#176;C. At the same time, the coating shows scratch resistance due to its good mechanical properties. The ball milling method mixes the host polymer and guest polymer at the nano level to achieve the self&#8208;healing and recycling properties.

      <title>Spin Wave Excitation, Detection, and Utilization in the Organic&#8208;Based Magnet, V(TCNE)x (TCNE = Tetracyanoethylene)</title>
      <dc:description>
Excited coherent and non&#8208;coherent spin waves in organic&#8208;based magnet [V(TCNE)x; TCNE = tetracyanoethylene; x &#8776; 2] can be respectively achieved by microwave and thermal means and this can be transformed into electric energy via the inverse spin Hall effect, in which the efficiency can be modulated by different spin wave modes.








Abstract
Spin waves, quantized as magnons, have low energy loss and magnetic damping, which are critical for devices based on spin&#8208;wave propagation needed for information processing devices. The organic&#8208;based magnet [V(TCNE)x; TCNE = tetracyanoethylene; x &#8776; 2] has shown an extremely low magnetic damping comparable to, for example, yttrium iron garnet (YIG). The excitation, detection, and utilization of coherent and non&#8208;coherent spin waves on various modes in V(TCNE)x is demonstrated and show that the angular momentum carried by microwave&#8208;excited coherent spin waves in a V(TCNE)x film can be transferred into an adjacent Pt layer via spin pumping and detected using the inverse spin Hall effect. The spin pumping efficiency can be tuned by choosing different excited spin wave modes in the V(TCNE)x film. In addition, it is shown that non&#8208;coherent spin waves in a V(TCNE)x film, excited thermally via the spin Seebeck effect, can also be used as spin pumping source that generates an electrical signal in Pt with a sign change in accordance with the magnetization switching of the V(TCNE)x. Combining coherent and non&#8208;coherent spin wave detection, the spin pumping efficiency can be thermally controlled, and new insight is gained for the spintronic applications of spin wave modes in organic&#8208;based magnets.

      <title>NiCo2O4&#8208;Based Nanosheets with Uniform 4 nm Mesopores for Excellent Zn&#8211;Air Battery Performance</title>
      <dc:description>
Optimized NiCo2.148O4 mesoporous nanosheets with an average Co valence state of 2.3 and uniform 4 nm mesopores demonstrate exceptional performance for Zn&#8211;air batteries under a wide temperature range from 80 to &#8722;35 &#176;C, which arises from the high activities of electron exchange and transfer by the surface lower&#8208;coordinated Co&#8208;sites within the porous region.








Abstract
Herein, a strategy is reported for the fabrication of NiCo2O4&#8208;based mesoporous nanosheets (PNSs) with tunable cobalt valence states and oxygen vacancies. The optimized NiCo2.148O4 PNSs with an average Co valence state of 2.3 and uniform 4 nm nanopores present excellent catalytic performance with an ultralow overpotential of 190 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and long&#8208;term stability (700 h) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media. Furthermore, Zn&#8211;air batteries built using the NiCo2.148O4 PNSs present a high power and energy density of 83 mW cm&#8722;2 and 910 Wh kg&#8722;1, respectively. Moreover, a portable battery box with NiCo2.148O4 PNSs as the air cathode presents long&#8208;term stability for 120 h under low temperatures in the range of 0 to &#8722;35 &#176;C. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the prominent electron exchange and transfer activity of the electrocatalyst is attributed to the surface lower&#8208;coordinated Co&#8208;sites in the porous region presenting a merging 3d&#8211;eg&#8211;t2g band, which overlaps with the Fermi level of the Zn&#8211;air battery system. This favors the adsorption of the *OH, and stabilized *O radicals are reached, toward competitively lower overpotential, demonstrating a generalized key for optimally boosting overall OER performance.

      <title>Solution&#8208;Processed Organic Solar Cells with High Open&#8208;Circuit Voltage of 1.3 V and Low Non&#8208;Radiative Voltage Loss of 0.16 V</title>
      <dc:description>
The relatively large non&#8208;radiative recombination voltage loss (&#916;Vnon&#8208;rad) is the main challenge for the development of organic solar cells (OSCs). &#916;Vnon&#8208;rad of OSCs can be effectively reduced to 0.16 V by adopting material combinations that deliver high ECT (the energy of charge&#8208;transfer state) and low &#916;ECT (energetic difference between singlet excited state and CT state), together with chlorination in donors.








Abstract
Compared with inorganic or perovskite solar cells, the relatively large non&#8208;radiative recombination voltage losses (&#916;Vnon&#8208;rad) in organic solar cells (OSCs) limit the improvement of the open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc). Herein, OSCs are fabricated by adopting two pairs of D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A polymers (PBT1&#8208;C/PBT1&#8208;C&#8208;2Cl and PBDB&#8208;T/PBDB&#8208;T&#8208;2Cl) as electron donors and a wide&#8208;bandgap molecule BTA3 as the electron acceptor. In these blends, a charge&#8208;transfer state energy (ECT) as high as 1.70&#8211;1.76 eV is achieved, leading to small energetic differences between the singlet excited states and charge&#8208;transfer states (&#916;ECT &#8776; 0.1 eV). In addition, after introducing chlorine atoms into the &#960;&#8208;bridge or the side chain of benzodithiophene (BDT) unit, electroluminescence external quantum efficiencies as high as 1.9 &#215; 10&#8722;3 and 1.0 &#215; 10&#8722;3 are realized in OSCs based on PBTI&#8208;C&#8208;2Cl and PBDB&#8208;T&#8208;2Cl, respectively. Their corresponding &#916;Vnon&#8208;rad are 0.16 and 0.17 V, which are lower than those of OSCs based on the analog polymers without a chlorine atom (0.21 and 0.24 V for PBT1&#8208;C and PBDB&#8208;T, respectively), resulting in high Voc of 1.3 V. The &#916;Vnon&#8208;rad of 0.16 V and Voc of 1.3 V achieved in PBT1&#8208;C&#8208;2Cl:BTA3 OSCs are thought to represent the best values for solution&#8208;processed OSCs reported in the literature so far.

      <title>Toward Rapid&#8208;Charging Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries using Hybrid&#8208;Phase Molybdenum Sulfide Selenide&#8208;Based Anodes</title>
      <dc:description>
Innovatively, a hybrid 1T/2H phase is constructed by the synergistic effect of dual&#8208;anions in MoSSe. Superior ionic/electrical conductivities can be attained due to the hybrid phase and rGO composite. Meanwhile, the stable structure for Na+ storage is ascribed to the enlarged layer spacing and remarkable pseudocapacitive effect. The strong interactions between Mo&#63743;S and Mo&#63743;Se bonds can effectively limit the dissolution of S/Se electrodes.

To attain both high energy density and power density in sodium&#8208;ion (Na+) batteries, the reaction kinetics and structural stability of anodes should be improved by materials optimization. In this work, few&#8208;layered molybdenum sulfide selenide (MoSSe) consisting of a mixture of 1T and 2H phases is designed to provide high ionic/electrical conductivities, low Na+ diffusion barrier, and stable Na+ storage. Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is used as a conductive matrix to form 3D electron transfer paths. The resulting MoSSe@rGO anode exhibits high capacity and rate performance in both organic and solid&#8208;state electrolytes. The ultrafast Na+ storage kinetics of the MoSSe@rGO anode is attributed to the surface&#8208;dominant reaction process and broad Na+ channels. In situ and ex situ measurements are conducted to reveal the Na+ storage process in MoSSe@rGO. It is found that the Mo&#63743;S and Mo&#63743;Se bonds effectively limit the dissolution of the active materials. The favorable Na+ storage kinetics of the MoSSe@rGO electrode are ascribed to its low adsorption energy of &#8722;1.997&#160;eV and low diffusion barrier of 0.087&#160;eV. These results reveal that anion doping of metal sulfides is a feasible strategy to develop sodium&#8208;ion batteries with high energy and power densities and long life&#8208;span.

&lt;p&gt;Innovatively, a hybrid 1T/2H phase is constructed by the synergistic effect of dual&#8208;anions in MoSSe. Superior ionic/electrical conductivities can be attained due to the hybrid phase and rGO composite. Meanwhile, the stable structure for Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; storage is ascribed to the enlarged layer spacing and remarkable pseudocapacitive effect. The strong interactions between Mo&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;S and Mo&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;Se bonds can effectively limit the dissolution of S/Se electrodes.

      <title>Stabilization of Sn Anode through Structural Reconstruction of a Cu&#8211;Sn Intermetallic Coating Layer</title>
      <dc:description>
A rigid Cu&#8211;Sn intermetallic coating layer (ICL) is designed to restrict the volume change of Sn anode through a structural reconstruction mechanism. A gradual separation of the metallic Cu phase from the Cu&#8211;Sn ICL provides a regulated distribution of Cu to buffer the volume change and suppress the mechanical degradation of Sn anode.








Abstract
The metallic tin (Sn) anode is a promising candidate for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) due to its high theoretical capacity and electrical conductivity. However, Sn suffers from severe mechanical degradation caused by large volume changes during lithiation/delithiation, which leads to a rapid capacity decay for LIBs application. Herein, a Cu&#8211;Sn (e.g., Cu3Sn) intermetallic coating layer (ICL) is rationally designed to stabilize Sn through a structural reconstruction mechanism. The low activity of the Cu&#8211;Sn ICL against lithiation/delithiation enables the gradual separation of the metallic Cu phase from the Cu&#8211;Sn ICL, which provides a regulatable and appropriate distribution of Cu to buffer volume change of Sn anode. Concurrently, the homogeneous distribution of the separated Sn together with Cu promotes uniform lithiation/delithiation, mitigating the internal stress. In addition, the residual rigid Cu&#8211;Sn intermetallic shows terrific mechanical integrity that resists the plastic deformation during the lithiation/delithiation. As a result, the Sn anode enhanced by the Cu&#8211;Sn ICL shows a significant improvement in cycling stability with a dramatically reduced capacity decay rate of 0.03% per cycle for 1000 cycles. The structural reconstruction mechanism in this work shines a light on new materials and structural design that can stabilize high&#8208;performance and high&#8208;volume&#8208;change electrodes for rechargeable batteries and beyond.

      <title>Enhanced Electricity Generation and Tunable Preservation in Porous Polymeric Materials via Coupled Piezoelectric and Dielectric Processes</title>
      <dc:description>
Energy conversion and preservation via a coupled piezo&#8208;dielectric phenomena in composite polymeric films are rationalized by combined experimental and simulation methods. High&#8208;voltage generation and long&#8208;preservation&#8208;period can be realized by porous films with a large thickness change, which generate more conductive pathways under stress and form air&#8208;filled pockets to break the conductive pathways during the depolarization process.








Abstract
Biological systems and artificial devices convert omnipresent low&#8208;frequency and weak mechanical stimulation into electricity for important functions. However, in&#8208;depth understanding of the energy conversion, boosting, and preservation processes of the coupled piezo&#8208;dielectric phenomenon in polymeric artificial materials is still lacking. In this study, combined experimental and simulation methods are employed to rationalize the process of energy conversion and preservation via a coupled piezo&#8208;dielectric phenomena in composite polymeric films. Both the intensity of the transmembrane electric voltages and the kinetic aspects of the energy generation and preservation process are elucidated. The study indicates that composite films consisting of a conductive filler fraction below the percolation threshold, effectively convert low&#8208;frequency mechanical stimulation to preserved electrical energy. Interestingly, film structure engineered into porous film has the ability to break the intertwined high&#8208;voltage and exhibits a low&#8208;preservation&#8208;period relationship; it can simultaneously provide high electric field intensity, high induction velocity, and a long preservation period. The model is not only supported by the experiments but is also consistent with the electricity generation and preservation features of other reported piezo&#8208;dielectric films. The systematic understanding can facilitate and inspire new device designs to better address the energy, environmental, and biomedical challenges faced by modern societies.

      <title>A Phenol&#8208;Amine Superglue Inspired by Insect Sclerotization Process</title>
      <dc:description>
This study reports phenol/amine superglue (PPS) inspired by insect cuticle&#8208;inspired chemistry. PPS is 100% waterborne superglue with unprecedented strong adhesion (&#8776;6 MPa) comparable to industrial epoxy glues. The key chemistry in PPS is silica agglomerate&#8208;mediated phenolic oxidation and entanglement network formations. Besides the adhesion, PPS exhibits superior biocompatibility without emitting volatile organic compounds.








Abstract
Exoskeletons of insects formed by sclerotization processes exhibit superstrong properties in moduli. Here, it is demonstrated that mimicking the sclerotization process using phenol and polyamine molecules unexpectedly results in a 100% ecofriendly, biocompatible waterborne superglue. Oxygen presented in air and dissolved in water acts as an initiator producing phenolic radical/quinone for superglue curing. Despite synthesis&#8208;free uses of water, phenol, and polyamine, its adhesion strength is comparable to commercial epoxy glue showing &gt;6 MPa in lap shear strength. The phenol&#8208;amine superglue bonds to various substrates including ceramics, woods, fabrics, plastics, metals, and importantly biological tissues. Due to strong adhesion, the superglue effectively seals wounds within a few seconds, and, due to its waterborne nature, no harmful respiratory effect is observed because of any release of volatile organic compounds. The easy, cost&#8208;effective preparation of the phenol&#8208;amine superglue can revolutionize varieties of industrial, biomedical, daily life processes.

An advanced liquid cell with an array of highly ordered graphene&#8208;covered nanochambers is designed for quantitative liquid&#8208;phase TEM analysis to establish collection of massive direct in situ data at a statistical meaningful level. Colloidal nanoparticle behavior, including diffusion, growth, and interactions, is quantitatively studied using the fabricated liquid cell.








Abstract
Liquid&#8208;phase transmission electron microscopy (TEM) offers a real&#8208;time microscopic observation of the nanometer scale for understanding the underlying mechanisms of the growth, etching, and interactions of colloidal nanoparticles. Despite such unique capability and potential application in diverse fields of analytical chemistry, liquid&#8208;phase TEM studies rely on information obtained from the limited number of observed events. In this work, a novel liquid cell with a large&#8208;scale array of highly ordered nanochambers is constructed by sandwiching an anodic aluminum oxide membrane between graphene sheets. TEM analysis of colloidal gold nanoparticles dispersed in the liquid is conducted, employing the fabricated nanochamber array, to demonstrate the potential of the nanochamber array in quantitative liquid&#8208;phase TEM. The independent TEM observations in the multiple nanochambers confirm that the monomer attachment and coalescence processes universally govern the overall growth of nanoparticles, although individual nanoparticles follow different growth trajectories.

      <dc:description>
Solid solutions of Cs3Bi2I9 and Cs3Sb2I9, Cs3Bi2xSb2&#8211;2xI9, are prepared as lead&#8208;free perovskites for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The HER performance of Cs3Bi0.6Sb1.4I9 is comparable to those of the best&#8208;known lead&#8208;based perovskites. There are several reasons why Cs3Bi0.6Sb1.4I9 is far better in the catalytic activities than Cs3Bi2I9 or Cs3Sb2I9. Compared with Cs3Bi2I9 and Cs3Sb2I9, Cs3Bi0.6Sb1.4I9 absorbs more strongly in a wider range of the visible spectrum and has far fewer midgap states.








Abstract
Lead&#8208;free perovskites Cs3Bi2xSb2&#8211;2xI9 (x = 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9) are prepared by a co&#8208;precipitation method and their photocatalytic performance for hydrogen production is studied in aqueous HI solution. Compared with the lead&#8208;based perovskite (CH3NH3)PbI3, Cs3Bi2xSb2&#8211;2xI9 has a better catalytic performance under air mass 1.5 G (AM 1.5 G) simulated sunlight (100 mW cm&#8722;2), powders of Cs3Bi0.6Sb1.4I9 (100 mg) loaded with Pt nanoparticles show &lt; H2 evolution rate of 92.6 &#181;mol h&#8722;1, which greatly exceeds that of (CH3NH3)PbI3 powders loaded with Pt nanoparticles (100 mg catalyst, 4 &#181;mol h&#8722;1). The Cs3Bi2xSb2&#8211;2xI9 has a high stability, with no apparent decrease in catalytic activity after five consecutive H2 evolution experiments. The doping of Sb in Cs3Bi2xSb2&#8211;2xI9 effectively reduces the contribution of Bi3+ on the conduction band, attenuating the effect of Bi vacancy on band structure. Compared with pure Cs3Bi2I9 and Cs3Sb2I9, Cs3Bi2xSb2&#8211;2xI9 has fewer midgap states and better optical absorption, which greatly enhances its performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction.

      <title>Supranano Alloys: Laser&#8208;Generated Supranano Liquid Metal as Efficient Electron Mediator in Hybrid Perovskite Solar Cells (Adv. Mater. 34/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article number 2001571, Yi Du, Hongqiang Wang, and co&#8208;workers report the development of a pioneering technology of pulsed laser irradiation for the production of supranano (&lt;10 nm) liquid metal. The decoration of such liquid ternary supranano alloys as an electron mediator at grain boundaries promotes electron extraction and transfer in hybrid perovskite films, which leads to greatly enhanced photoconversion efficiency in perovskite solar cells of up to 22.03%.

      <title>Superhydrophobic Coatings: Wet&#8208;Style Superhydrophobic Antifogging Coatings for Optical Sensors (Adv. Mater. 34/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article number 2002710, Dong&#8208;Pyo Kim, Hyomin Lee, and co&#8208;workers report a wet&#8208;style superhydrophobic coating that exhibits excellent optical properties under a variety of environmental challenges. This coating for optical sensors is prepared by pattern transferring low&#8208;surface&#8208;energy microstructures onto a polymer&#8211;silica nanocomposite. The polymer&#8211;silica nanocomposite guides water molecules to preferably condense into and suppress reflection, while the low&#8208;surface&#8208;energy microstructure enables the coating to exhibit self&#8208;cleaning properties.

&lt;p&gt;In article number &lt;a&gt;https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.2020027102002710&lt;/a&gt;, Dong&#8208;Pyo Kim, Hyomin Lee, and co&#8208;workers report a wet&#8208;style superhydrophobic coating that exhibits excellent optical properties under a variety of environmental challenges. This coating for optical sensors is prepared by pattern transferring low&#8208;surface&#8208;energy microstructures onto a polymer&#8211;silica nanocomposite. The polymer&#8211;silica nanocomposite guides water molecules to preferably condense into and suppress reflection, while the low&#8208;surface&#8208;energy microstructure enables the coating to exhibit self&#8208;cleaning properties.

      <title>Cuprate Thin Films: Interfacial Oxygen&#8208;Driven Charge Localization and Plasmon Excitation in Unconventional Superconductors (Adv. Mater. 34/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
Manipulation of charge localization in optimally doped copper oxide (cuprate) thin&#8208;films via interfacial hybridization is reported by Xinmao Yin, Andrivo Rusydi, Andrew T. S.

      <title>Polymer&#8208;Based Batteries&#8212;Flexible and Thin Energy Storage Systems</title>
      <dc:description>
The utilization of polymeric active materials within batteries enables the design and fabrication of flexible and thin energy storage systems. Moreover, these batteries can also feature very high power densities allowing charging/discharging within a few seconds to minutes. The properties of the utilized redox polymers can be tuned by the molecular structure.








Abstract
Batteries have become an integral part of everyday life&#8212;from small coin cells to batteries for mobile phones, as well as batteries for electric vehicles and an increasing number of stationary energy storage applications. There is a large variety of standardized battery sizes (e.g., the familiar AA&#8208;battery or AAA&#8208;battery). Interestingly, all these battery systems are based on a huge number of different cell chemistries depending on the application and the corresponding requirements. There is not one single battery type fulfilling all demands for all imaginable applications. One battery class that has been gaining significant interest in recent years is polymer&#8208;based batteries. These batteries utilize organic materials as the active parts within the electrodes without utilizing metals (and their compounds) as the redox&#8208;active materials. Such polymer&#8208;based batteries feature a number of interesting properties, like high power densities and flexible batteries fabrication, among many more.

      <title>Beyond What Meets the Eye: Imaging and Imagining Wood Mechanical&#8211;Structural Properties</title>
      <dc:description>
A review of the imaging of wood at various length scales is presented, showing how hierarchical properties are achieved and demonstrating unique levels of physical and mechanical performance.








Abstract
Wood presents a hierarchical structure, containing features at all length scales: from the tracheids or vessels that make up its cellular structure, through to the microfibrils within the cell walls, down to the molecular architecture of the cellulose, lignin, and hemicelluloses that comprise its chemical makeup. This structure renders it with high mechanical (e.g., modulus and strength) and interesting physical (e.g., optical) properties. A better understanding of this structure, and how it plays a role in governing mechanical and other physical parameters, will help to better exploit this sustainable resource. Here, recent developments on the use of advanced imaging techniques for studying the structural properties of wood in relation to its mechanical properties are explored. The focus is on synchrotron nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction, X&#8208;ray tomographical imaging, Raman and infrared spectroscopies, confocal microscopy, electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy. Critical discussion on the role of imaging techniques and how fields are developing rapidly to incorporate both spatial and temporal ranges of analysis is presented.

      <title>Stretchable Electronics Based on PDMS Substrates</title>
      <dc:description>
Elastic substrates, especially poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) substrates, are indispensable components for emerging stretchable electronics. Detailed design concepts and fabrication strategies for structured, patterned, and self&#8208;healing PDMS substrates, and their contributions in enhancing the mechanical performance of stretchable electronics are discussed. Future perspectives and challenges in the development of stretchable and self&#8208;healing PDMS substrates are highlighted.








Abstract
Stretchable electronics, which can retain their functions under stretching, have attracted great interest in recent decades. Elastic substrates, which bear the applied strain and regulate the strain distribution in circuits, are indispensable components in stretchable electronics. Moreover, the self&#8208;healing property of the substrate is a premise to endow stretchable electronics with the same characteristics, so the device may recover from failure resulting from large and frequent deformations. Therefore, the properties of the elastic substrate are crucial to the overall performance of stretchable devices. Poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) is widely used as the substrate material for stretchable electronics, not only because of its advantages, which include stable chemical properties, good thermal stability, transparency, and biological compatibility, but also because of its capability of attaining designer functionalities via surface modification and bulk property tailoring. Herein, the strategies for fabricating stretchable electronics on PDMS substrates are summarized, and the influence of the physical and chemical properties of PDMS, including surface chemical status, physical modulus, geometric structures, and self&#8208;healing properties, on the performance of stretchable electronics is discussed. Finally, the challenges and future opportunities of stretchable electronics based on PDMS substrates are considered.

      <title>Superior Carrier Lifetimes Exceeding 6 &#181;s in Polycrystalline Halide Perovskites</title>
      <dc:description>
Ultralong charge&#8208;carrier lifetimes &gt;6 &#956;s are achieved in polycrystalline halide perovskites by decorating the grain boundaries with a trace amount of electron&#8208;rich anchors, which benefits from weak excitonic effects and the weakening of electron&#8211;phonon couplings in passivated films, fulfilling reduced voltage deficits and enhanced efficiencies in perovskite photovoltaics. This finding provides a new insight into realizing superior carrier properties of polycrystalline perovskite films and high&#8208;performance perovskite optoelectronics.








Abstract
Lead halide perovskite films have witnessed rapid progress in optoelectronic devices, whereas polycrystalline heterogeneities and serious native defects in films are still responsible for undesired recombination pathways, causing insufficient utilization of photon&#8208;generated charge carriers. Here, radiation&#8208;enhanced polycrystalline perovskite films with ultralong carrier lifetimes exceeding 6 &#956;s and single&#8208;crystal&#8208;like electron&#8211;hole diffusion lengths of more than 5 &#956;m are achieved. Prolongation of charge&#8208;carrier activities is attributed to the electronic structure regulation and the defect elimination at crystal boundaries in the perovskite with the introduction of phenylmethylammonium iodide. The introduced electron&#8208;rich anchor molecules around the host crystals prefer to fill the halide/organic vacancies at the boundaries, rather than form low&#8208;dimensional phases or be inserted into the original lattice. The weakening of the electron&#8208;phonon coupling and the excitonic features of the photogenerated carriers in the optimized films, which together contribute to the enhancement of carrier separation and transportation, are further confirmed. Finally the resultant perovskite films in fully operating solar cells with champion efficiency of 23.32% are validated and a minimum voltage deficit of 0.39 V is realized.

      <title>In Situ Topotactic Transformation of an Interstitial Alloy for CO Electroreduction</title>
      <dc:description>
Cu3N nanocrystals with a controlled density of twin structures are prepared through regulating the kinetics of crystal growth. Through in situ activation during the CO electroreduction, the obtained metallic Cu&#176; catalyst particles inherit the lattice dislocations. Using a membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer with a solid&#8208;state electrolyte, high&#8208;concentration gas and liquid multi&#8208;carbon product streams are obtained simultaneously.








Abstract
Electrochemical reduction of CO to value&#8208;added products holds promise for storage of energy from renewable sources. Copper can convert CO into multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) products during CO electroreduction. However, developing a Cu electrocatalyst with a high selectivity for CO reduction and desirable production rates for C2+ products remains challenging. Herein, highly lattice&#8208;disordered Cu3N with abundant twin structures as a precursor electrocatalyst is examined for CO reduction. Through in situ activation during the CO reduction reaction (CORR) and concomitant release of nitrogen, the obtained metallic Cu&#176; catalyst particles inherit the lattice dislocations present in the parent Cu3N lattice. The de&#8208;nitrified catalyst delivers an unprecedented C2+ Faradaic efficiency of over 90% at a current density of 727&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in a flow cell system. Using a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzer with a solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE), a 17.4 vol% ethylene stream and liquid streams with concentration of 1.45 m and 230&#160;&#215; 10&#8722;3 m C2+ products at the outlet of the cathode and SSE&#8208;containment layer are obtained.

&lt;p&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N nanocrystals with a controlled density of twin structures are prepared through regulating the kinetics of crystal growth. Through in situ activation during the CO electroreduction, the obtained metallic Cu&#176; catalyst particles inherit the lattice dislocations. Using a membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer with a solid&#8208;state electrolyte, high&#8208;concentration gas and liquid multi&#8208;carbon product streams are obtained simultaneously.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrochemical reduction of CO to value&#8208;added products holds promise for storage of energy from renewable sources. Copper can convert CO into multi&#8208;carbon (C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt;) products during CO electroreduction. However, developing a Cu electrocatalyst with a high selectivity for CO reduction and desirable production rates for C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; products remains challenging. Herein, highly lattice&#8208;disordered Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N with abundant twin structures as a precursor electrocatalyst is examined for CO reduction. Through in situ activation during the CO reduction reaction (CORR) and concomitant release of nitrogen, the obtained metallic Cu&#176; catalyst particles inherit the lattice dislocations present in the parent Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N lattice. The de&#8208;nitrified catalyst delivers an unprecedented C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; Faradaic efficiency of over 90% at a current density of 727&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in a flow cell system. Using a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzer with a solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE), a 17.4 vol% ethylene stream and liquid streams with concentration of 1.45 &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; and 230&#160;&#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; 
&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; products at the outlet of the cathode and SSE&#8208;containment layer are obtained.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Versatile Phospholipid Assemblies for Functional Synthetic Cells and Artificial Tissues</title>
      <dc:description>
Phospholipids, with a hydrophilic head and two hydrophobic tails, are amphiphilic compounds capable of assembling into versatile membranous assemblies for the study of synthetic cells and artificial tissues. Current synthetic cell studies realize partial cell characteristics. It is imperative to increase hierarchical complexity of synthetic cells for a minimal cell with full life features.








Abstract
The bottom&#8208;up construction of a synthetic cell from nonliving building blocks capable of mimicking cellular properties and behaviors helps to understand the particular biophysical properties and working mechanisms of a cell. A synthetic cell built in this way possesses defined chemical composition and structure. Since phospholipids are native biomembrane components, their assemblies are widely used to mimic cellular structures. Here, recent developments in the formation of versatile phospholipid assemblies are described, together with the applications of these assemblies for functional membranes (protein reconstituted giant unilamellar vesicles), spherical and nonspherical protoorganelles, and functional synthetic cells, as well as the high&#8208;order hierarchical structures of artificial tissues. Their biomedical applications are also briefly summarized. Finally, the challenges and future directions in the field of synthetic cells and artificial tissues based on phospholipid assemblies are proposed.

      <title>Injectable and NIR&#8208;Responsive DNA&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid Hydrogels with Outstanding Photothermal Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>
NIR&#8208;light&#8208;responsive and injectable DNA&#8211;inorganic hybrid hydrogels with high photothermal efficiency are fabricated. This is due to the formed network between the DNA and UCNP&#8208;Au nanoparticles. The ultrastrong photothermal effect in the system endows the soft material with extraordinary cancer therapy.

Abstract
Surgical excision is one of the main treatments for malignant tumors. However, high risk of tumour recurrence is a major challenge. Near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;light&#8208;induced tumor photothermal therapy has been studied, while its clinical applications are still restricted due to the limited therapeutic effects. To address this, here, a novel NIR&#8208;light&#8208;responsive and injectable DNA&#8208;mediated upconversion and Au nanoparticle hybrid (DNA&#8211;UCNP&#8208;Au) hydrogel is developed. Due to the confined and concentrated environment induced by the interaction between adjacent DNA strands and UCNP&#8208;Au NPs, an ultrastrong photothermal effect is observed. A photothermal efficiency as high as 42.7% is realized in the hydrogel, which is superior to pristine inorganic particles. Upon direct peritumoral injection of the hydrogel and with the treatment of 808&#160;nm laser irradiation, tumors are eradicated and no recurrence is observed. Meanwhile, there are no side effects on normal tissues due to the local treatment. Taking advantage of the high phototherapeutic effect, biocompatibility, and flexible operability in this system, a novel approach for malignant tumor therapy is demonstrated.

      <title>Imaging Domain Reversal in an Ultrathin Van der Waals Ferromagnet</title>
      <dc:description>
A magnetic imaging technique based on nitrogen&#8208;vacancy centers in diamond is used to investigate ultrathin flakes of vanadium triiodide (VI3). The results reveal that ultrathin VI3 is a nucleation&#8208;type hard ferromagnet with a coercivity set by the anisotropy strength. The spontaneous magnetization determined for individual flakes is found to be lower than in bulk VI3.








Abstract
The recent isolation of 2D van der Waals magnetic materials has uncovered rich physics that often differs from the magnetic behavior of their bulk counterparts. However, the microscopic details of fundamental processes such as the initial magnetization or domain reversal, which govern the magnetic hysteresis, remain largely unknown in the ultrathin limit. Here a widefield nitrogen&#8208;vacancy (NV) microscope is employed to directly image these processes in few&#8208;layer flakes of the magnetic semiconductor vanadium triiodide (VI3). Complete and abrupt switching of most flakes is observed at fields Hc&#160;&#8776; 0.5&#8211;1&#160;T (at 5 K) independent of thickness. The coercive field decreases as the temperature approaches the Curie temperature (Tc&#160;&#8776; 50&#160;K); however, the switching remains abrupt. The initial magnetization process is then imaged, which reveals thickness&#8208;dependent domain wall depinning fields well below Hc. These results point to ultrathin VI3 being a nucleation&#8208;type hard ferromagnet, where the coercive field is set by the anisotropy&#8208;limited domain wall nucleation field. This work illustrates the power of widefield NV microscopy to investigate magnetization processes in van der Waals ferromagnets, which can be used to elucidate the origin of the hard ferromagnetic properties of other materials and explore field&#8208; and current&#8208;driven domain wall dynamics.

      <title>Exploiting a Single&#8208;Crystal Environment to Minimize the Charge Noise on Qubits in Silicon</title>
      <dc:description>
Despite electron spins in silicon offering a competitive, scalable quantum&#8208;computing platform, two&#8208;qubit gate fidelities to date have fallen short of the 99% threshold required for error&#8208;corrected processors. A notably low level of charge noise of S0&#160;= 0.0088 &#177; 0.0004 &#956;eV2 Hz&#8722;1 is achieved by hosting atom qubits in a crystalline silicon substrate. By separating the atom qubits from surface and interface states, the paper shows how 99.99% two&#8208;qubit gate fidelities can be achieved in silicon.








Abstract
Electron spins in silicon offer a competitive, scalable quantum&#8208;computing platform with excellent single&#8208;qubit properties. However, the two&#8208;qubit gate fidelities achieved so far have fallen short of the 99% threshold required for large&#8208;scale error&#8208;corrected quantum computing architectures. In the past few years, there has been a growing realization that the critical obstacle in meeting this threshold in semiconductor qubits is charge noise arising from the qubit environment. In this work, a notably low level of charge noise of S0&#160;= 0.0088 &#177; 0.0004 &#956;eV2 Hz&#8722;1 is demonstrated using atom qubits in crystalline silicon, achieved by separating the qubits from surfaces and interface states. The charge noise is measured using both a single electron transistor and an exchange&#8208;coupled qubit pair that collectively provide a consistent charge noise spectrum over four frequency decades, with the noise level S0 being an order of magnitude lower than previously reported. Low&#8208;frequency detuning noise, set by the total measurement time, is shown to be the dominant dephasing source of two&#8208;qubit exchange oscillations. With recent advances in fast (&#8776;&#956;s) single&#8208;shot readout, it is shown that by reducing the total measurement time to &#8776;1 s, 99.99% two&#8208;qubit SWAP gate fidelities can be achieved in single&#8208;crystal atom qubits in&#160;silicon.

      <title>Gel Electrocatalysts: An Emerging Material Platform for Electrochemical Energy Conversion</title>
      <dc:description>
Gel electrocatalysts represent an emerging class of materials for sustainable energy technologies. The advantageous features of gel frameworks based on hierarchically porous architecture, high tenability, and functionalization enable them to potentially break the limitations of current materials. An overview of rational synthesis is provided and advanced applications of gel electrocatalysts are highlighted. Challenges and outlooks for gel electrocatalysts are also discussed.








Abstract
Seeking sustainable and cost&#8208;effective energy sources is one of the significant challenges for the sustainable development of modern society. To date, considerable expectations have been held for technologies, such as fuel cells and electrolyzers, where the performance strongly depends on electrochemical conversion processes that can generate and store chemical energy through the breaking or formation of chemical bonds. However, those advanced technologies are severely limited by the efficiency, selectivity, and durability of electrocatalysis. Thanks to their hierarchically porous architecture, compositional and structural tunability, and ease of functionalization, the family of gel materials opens exciting opportunities for advanced energy technologies. Unique advances in gel materials based on controllable compositions and functions enable gel electrocatalysts to potentially break the limitations of current materials, enhancing the device performance of electrochemical energy. Here, recent developments and challenges for nanostructured gel&#8208;based materials for electrocatalysis applications are summarized. Future possibilities and challenges for gel electrocatalysts in terms of synthesis and applications are also discussed.

     alt="Gel Electrocatalysts: An Emerging Material Platform for Electrochemical Energy Conversion"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gel electrocatalysts represent an emerging class of materials for sustainable energy technologies. The advantageous features of gel frameworks based on hierarchically porous architecture, high tenability, and functionalization enable them to potentially break the limitations of current materials. An overview of rational synthesis is provided and advanced applications of gel electrocatalysts are highlighted. Challenges and outlooks for gel electrocatalysts are also discussed.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeking sustainable and cost&#8208;effective energy sources is one of the significant challenges for the sustainable development of modern society. To date, considerable expectations have been held for technologies, such as fuel cells and electrolyzers, where the performance strongly depends on electrochemical conversion processes that can generate and store chemical energy through the breaking or formation of chemical bonds. However, those advanced technologies are severely limited by the efficiency, selectivity, and durability of electrocatalysis. Thanks to their hierarchically porous architecture, compositional and structural tunability, and ease of functionalization, the family of gel materials opens exciting opportunities for advanced energy technologies. Unique advances in gel materials based on controllable compositions and functions enable gel electrocatalysts to potentially break the limitations of current materials, enhancing the device performance of electrochemical energy. Here, recent developments and challenges for nanostructured gel&#8208;based materials for electrocatalysis applications are summarized. Future possibilities and challenges for gel electrocatalysts in terms of synthesis and applications are also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Elucidating the Opportunities and Challenges for Nanocellulose Spinning</title>
      <dc:description>
Nanocellulose presents an opportunity for the development of a new class of man&#8208;made biobased fibers that can replace high&#8208;performance fossil&#8208;based fibers, as well as provide fibers with new advanced functionalities. Promising material concepts are available, but successful scale&#8208;up will need more profound insights into the mechanisms that control nanoscale assembly during processing.








Abstract
Man&#8208;made continuous fibers play an essential role in society today. With the increase in global sustainability challenges, there is a broad spectrum of societal needs where the development of advanced biobased fibers could provide means to address the challenges. Biobased regenerated fibers, produced from dissolved cellulose are widely used today for clothes, upholstery, and linens. With new developments in the area of advanced biobased fibers, it would be possible to compete with high&#8208;performance synthetic fibers such as glass fibers and carbon fibers as well as to provide unique functionalities. One possible development is to fabricate fibers by spinning filaments from nanocellulose, Nature's nanoscale high&#8208;performance building block, which will require detailed insights into nanoscale assembly mechanisms during spinning, as well as knowledge regarding possible functionalization. If successful, this could result in a new class of man&#8208;made biobased fibers. This work aims to identify the progress made in the field of spinning of nanocellulose filaments, as well as outline necessary steps for efficient fabrication of such nanocellulose&#8208;based filaments with controlled and predictable properties.

      <title>Boosting Reaction Homogeneity in High&#8208;Energy Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery Cathode Materials</title>
      <dc:description>
Boosting reaction homogeneity in high&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;ion battery cathode materials is important to stabilize their electrochemical performance. However, conventional nickel&#8208;rich materials suffer from morphological collapse which deteriorates the electrode integrity with heterogeneous reaction behavior. To mitigate these issues, mechanically robust single&#8208;crystalline nickel&#8208;rich particles are suggested. They perfectly maintain their chemo&#8208;mechanical properties during the harsh electrochemical testing condition.








Abstract
Conventional nickel&#8208;rich cathode materials suffer from reaction heterogeneity during electrochemical cycling particularly at high temperature, because of their polycrystalline properties and secondary particle morphology. Despite intensive research on the morphological evolution of polycrystalline nickel&#8208;rich materials, its practical investigation at the electrode and cell levels is still rarely discussed. Herein, an intrinsic limitation of polycrystalline nickel&#8208;rich cathode materials in high&#8208;energy full&#8208;cells is discovered under industrial electrode&#8208;fabrication conditions. Owing to their highly unstable chemo&#8208;mechanical properties, even after the first cycle, nickel&#8208;rich materials are degraded in the longitudinal direction of the high&#8208;energy electrode. This inhomogeneous degradation behavior of nickel&#8208;rich materials at the electrode level originates from the overutilization of active materials on the surface side, causing a severe non&#8208;uniform potential distribution during long&#8208;term cycling. In addition, this phenomenon continuously lowers the reversibility of lithium ions. Consequently, considering the degradation of polycrystalline nickel&#8208;rich materials, this study suggests the adoption of a robust single&#8208;crystalline LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 as a feasible alternative, to effectively suppress the localized overutilization of active materials. Such an adoption can stabilize the electrochemical performance of high&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;ion cells, in which superior capacity retention above &#8776;80% after 1000 cycles at 45 &#176;C is demonstrated.

      <title>Conjugated Acetylenic Polymers Grafted Cuprous Oxide as an Efficient Z&#8208;Scheme Heterojunction for Photoelectrochemical Water Reduction</title>
      <dc:description>
A conjugated acetylenic polymers (CAPs)/cuprous oxide Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction is fabricated by a general nanocopper&#8208;mediated Glaser polycondensation strategy based on in situ conversion of nanocopper into Cu2O in the growth of the CAPs. Eventually, the as&#8208;fabricated poly(2,5&#8208;diethynylthieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene) (pDET)/Cu2O Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction substantially facilitates charge separation/transfer and exhibits state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance for photoelectrochemical hydrogen evolution.








Abstract
As attractive materials for photoeletrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (PEC HER), conjugated polymers (e.g., conjugated acetylenic polymers [CAPs]) still show poor PEC HER performance due to the associated serious recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes. Herein, taking advantage of the in situ conversion of nanocopper into Cu2O on copper cellulose paper during catalyzing of the Glaser coupling reaction, a general strategy for the construction of a CAPs/Cu2O Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction for PEC water reduction is demonstrated. The as&#8208;fabricated poly(2,5&#8208;diethynylthieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene) (pDET)/Cu2O Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction exhibits a carrier separation efficiency of 16.1% at 0.3&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), which is 6.7 and 1.4&#8208;times higher respectively than those for pDET and Cu2O under AM 1.5G irradiation (100&#160;mW cm&#8722;2) in the 0.1 m Na2SO4 aqueous solution. Consequently, the photocurrent of the pDET/Cu2O Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction reaches &#8776;520 &#181;A cm&#8722;2 at 0.3&#160;V versus RHE, which is much higher than pDET (&#8776;80 &#181;A cm&#8722;2), Cu2O (&#8776;100 &#181;A cm&#8722;2), and the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art cocatalyst&#8208;free organic or organic&#8208;semiconductor&#8208;based heterojunctions/homojunctions photocathodes (1&#8211;370 &#181;A cm&#8722;2). This work advances the design of polymer&#8208;based Z&#8208;scheme heterojunctions and high&#8208;performance organic photoelectrodes.

      <title>Independent Tuning of Nano&#8208;Ligand Frequency and Sequences Regulates the Adhesion and Differentiation of Stem Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
A heterogeneous barcoding system including RGD&#8208;bearing Au and RGD&#8208;free Fe nano&#8208;segments is developed to independently present tunable nano&#8208;ligand frequency and sequences without modulating nanoscale and macroscale ligand density. The low&#8208;frequency and terminally sequenced nano&#8208;ligands are demonstrated as novel and independent parameters facilitating focal adhesion&#8208;mediated mechanotransduction of stem cells, both in vitro and in vivo, which facilitate their subsequent differentiation.








Abstract
The native extracellular matrix (ECM) can exhibit heterogeneous nano&#8208;sequences periodically displaying ligands to regulate complex cell&#8211;material interactions in vivo. Herein, an ECM&#8208;emulating heterogeneous barcoding system, including ligand&#8208;bearing Au and ligand&#8208;free Fe nano&#8208;segments, is developed to independently present tunable frequency and sequences in nano&#8208;segments of cell&#8208;adhesive RGD ligand. Specifically, similar exposed surface areas of total Fe and Au nano&#8208;segments are designed. Fe segments are used for substrate coupling of nanobarcodes and as ligand&#8208;free nano&#8208;segments and Au segments for ligand coating while maintaining both nanoscale (local) and macroscale (total) ligand density constant in all groups. Low nano&#8208;ligand frequency in the same sequences and terminally sequenced nano&#8208;ligands at the same frequency independently facilitate focal adhesion and mechanosensing of stem cells, which are collectively effective both in vitro and in vivo, thereby inducing stem cell differentiation. The Fe/RGD&#8208;Au nanobarcode implants exhibit high stability and no local and systemic toxicity in various tissues and organs in vivo. This work sheds novel insight into designing biomaterials with heterogeneous nano&#8208;ligand sequences at terminal sides and/or low frequency to facilitate cellular adhesion. Tuning the electrodeposition conditions can allow synthesis of unlimited combinations of ligand nano&#8208;sequences and frequencies, magnetic elements, and bioactive ligands to remotely regulate numerous host cells in vivo.

      <title>Controlled Lengthwise Assembly of Helical Peptide Nanofibers to Modulate CD8+ T&#8208;Cell Responses</title>
      <dc:description>
Rationally designed peptides control the assembly of &#945;&#8208;helical peptide nanofibers, allowing the adjustment of nanofiber length within the range of &gt;1 &#181;m&#160;to 100&#160;nm. Shortened nanofibers, while raising equivalent B&#8208;cell responses compared to full&#8208;length fibers, induce heightened CD8+ T&#8208;cell responses in mice.








Abstract
Peptide nanofibers are useful for many biological applications, including immunotherapy, tissue engineering, and drug delivery. The robust lengthwise assembly of these peptides into nanofibers is typically difficult to control, resulting in polydisperse fiber lengths and an incomplete understanding of how nanofiber length affects biological responses. Here, rationally designed capping peptides control the length of helical peptide nanofibers with unique precision. These designed peptides bind the tips of elongated nanofibers to shorten and narrow their length distributions. Demonstrating their use as immunotherapies, capped nanofibers are preferentially cross&#8208;presented by dendritic cells compared to uncapped nanofibers. Due to increased cross&#8208;presentation, these capped nanofibers trigger stronger CD8+ T&#8208;cell responses in mice than uncapped nanofibers. This strategy illustrates a means for controlling the length of supramolecular peptide nanofibers to modulate their immunogenicity in the context of immunotherapies.

      <title>Irradiation&#8208;Induced Extremes Create Hierarchical Face&#8208;/Body&#8208;Centered&#8208;Cubic Phases in Nanostructured High Entropy Alloys</title>
      <dc:description>
A nanoscale hierarchical dual&#8208;phase structure is reported to form in a nanocrystalline NiFeCoCrCu high&#8208;entropy&#8208;alloy film via ion&#8208;irradiation&#8208;induced FCC to BCC phase transformation. Both kinetic and thermodynamic conditions for the phase transformation are explored. The results provide a new strategy for tailoring material structures on the nanometer or sub&#8208;nanometer scales.








Abstract
A nanoscale hierarchical dual&#8208;phase structure is reported to form in a nanocrystalline NiFeCoCrCu high&#8208;entropy&#8208;alloy (HEA) film via ion irradiation. Under the extreme energy deposition and consequent thermal energy dissipation induced by energetic particles, a fundamentally new phenomenon is revealed, in which the original single&#8208;phase face&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (FCC) structure partially transforms into alternating nanometer layers of a body&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (BCC) structure. The orientation relationship follows the Nishiyama&#8211;Wasser&#8208;man relationship, that is, (011)BCC || (&#8198;1&#175;1&#175;1)FCC and [100]BCC || [&#8198;11&#175;0]FCC. Simulation results indicate that Cr, as a BCC stabilizing element, exhibits a tendency to segregate to the stacking faults (SFs). Furthermore, the high densities of SFs and twin boundaries in each nanocrystalline grain serve to accelerate the nucleation and growth of the BCC phase during irradiation. By adjusting the irradiation parameters, desired thicknesses of the FCC and BCC phases in the laminates can be achieved. This work demonstrates the controlled formation of an attractive dual&#8208;phase nanolaminate structure under ion irradiation and provides a strategy for designing new derivate structures of HEAs.

      <title>Transparent Hole&#8208;Transporting Frameworks: A Unique Strategy to Design High&#8208;Performance Semitransparent Organic Photovoltaics</title>
      <dc:description>
A&#160;unique strategy of &#8220;transparent hole&#8208;transporting frameworks&#8221; is proposed. A hole&#8208;transporting large&#8208;bandgap polymer PTAA is employed to partially replace the polymer donors in the active layer. As a result, semitransparent organic photovoltaic devices with power conversion efficiencies &#8776;12% and average visible transmittances &#8776;20% are achieved both on rigid and flexible substrates.








Abstract
Thanks to the nature of molecular orbitals, the absorption spectra of organic semiconductors are not continuous like those in traditional inorganic semiconductors, which offers a unique application of organic photovoltaics (OPVs): semitransparent OPVs. Recently, the exciting progress of materials design has promoted the development of semitransparent OPVs. However, in the perspective of device engineering, almost all reported works reduce the thickness of back/reflected electrode to obtain high average visible transmittance (AVT), which is a trade&#8208;off between power conversion efficiency (PCE) and the transmittance of the whole solar spectrum (visible and infrared), and therefore limit the further development. Herein, a unique strategy of &#8220;transparent hole&#8208;transporting frameworks&#8221; is proposed. A hole&#8208;transporting large&#8208;bandgap polymer (poly[bis(4&#8208;phenyl)(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)amine (PTAA)) is employed to partially replace polymer donors in the active layer of PBDB&#8208;T/Y1. PTAA is a p&#8208;type polymer with a large bandgap of 2.9&#160;eV; the partial substitution of PBDB&#8208;T by PTAA reduces the absorption of the active layer only in the visible region, keeping the hole&#8208;transporting pathways as well as the optimized film morphology. As a result, semitransparent OPVs with PCEs of 12% and AVTs of 20% are achieved, both on rigid and flexible substrates. To demonstrate the generality, this strategy is also used in three different active layers.

      <title>A Quantitative Bacteria Monitoring and Killing Platform Based on Electron Transfer from Bacteria to a Semiconductor</title>
      <dc:description>
Enhanced electron transfer (ET) from bacteria to a Au&#8208;modified semiconductor (Au@ZnO) is observed for fast bacteria sensing and killing with excellent extendability, stability, and recyclability. ET produces a saturation current depending linearly on the bacterial number, semi&#8208;logarithmically, and continuous electron loss swiftly kills bacteria. The concept can be incorporated into smart and miniaturized devices that sense and kill bacteria simultaneously.








Abstract
A platform with both bacteria killing and sensing capabilities is crucial for monitoring the entire bacteria&#8208;related process on biomaterials and biomedical devices. Electron transfer (ET) between the bacteria and a Au&#8208;loaded semiconductor (ZnO) is observed to be the primary factor for effective bacteria sensing and fast bacteria killing. The electrons produce a saturation current that varies linearly with the bacteria number, semi&#8208;logarithmically, with R2 of 0.98825, thus providing an excellent tool to count bacteria quantitatively in real&#8208;time. Furthermore, ET leads to continuous electron loss killing of about 80% of Escherichia coli in only 1 h without light. The modularity and extendability of this ET&#8208;based platform are also demonstrated by the excellent results obtained from other semiconductor/substrate systems and the stability is confirmed by recycling tests. The underlying mechanism for the dual functions is not due to conventional attributed Zn2+ leaching or photocatalysis but instead electrical interactions upon direct contact. The results reveal the capability of real&#8208;time detection of bacteria based on ET while providing information about the antibacterial behavior of ZnO&#8208;based materials especially in the early stage. The concept can be readily incorporated into the design of smart and miniaturized devices that can sense and kill bacteria simultaneously.

      <title>Tailoring of Typical Color Centers in Diamond for Photonics</title>
      <dc:description>
The unique electronic structure and excellent spin coherence attract the interest of many researchers to the nitrogen&#8208;vacancy color center. Although the application prospect is promising, there are still some problems to solve before fully exerting its characteristic performance. The research progress in these issues is summarized and commented on to help researchers grasp the current trends.








Abstract
On the demand of single&#8208;photon entangled light sources and high&#8208;sensitivity probes in the fields of quantum information processing, weak magnetic field detection and biosensing, the nitrogen vacancy (NV) color center is very attractive and has been deeply and intensively studied, due to its convenience of spin initialization, operation, and optical readout combined with long coherence time in the ambient environment. Although the application prospect is promising, there are still some problems to be solved before fully exerting its characteristic performance, including enhancement of emission of NV centers in certain charge state (NV&#8722; or NV0), obtaining indistinguishable photons, and improving of collecting efficiency for the photons. Herein, the research progress in these issues is reviewed and commented on to help researchers grasp the current trends. In addition, the development of emerging color centers, such as germanium vacancy defects, and rare&#8208;earth dopants, with great potential for various applications, are also briefly surveyed.

A versatile cyclometalated iridium (III) complex is designed, which achieves super&#8208;resolution optical and electron microscopy correlation. The selective insertion of the probe into a microtubule triggers remarkable fluorescence enhancement and promising electron contrast. Correlative light electron microscopy (CLEM) and energy&#8208;filtered transmission electron microscopy (EF&#8208;TEM) reveals the well&#8208;associated optical and electron signal at a high specificity, with an interspace of &#8776;41 &#197; of microtubule monomer in cells.








Abstract
The visualization of microtubules by combining optical and electron microscopy techniques provides valuable information to understand correlated intracellular activities. However, the lack of appropriate probes to bridge both microscopic resolutions restricts the areas and structures that can be comprehended within such highly assembled structures. Here, a versatile cyclometalated iridium (III) complex is designed that achieves synchronous fluorescence&#8211;electron microscopy correlation. The selective insertion of the probe into a microtubule triggers remarkable fluorescence enhancement and promising electron contrast. The long&#8208;life, highly photostable probe allows live&#8208;cell super&#8208;resolution imaging of tubulin localization and motion with a resolution of &#8776;30 nm. Furthermore, correlative light&#8211;electron microscopy and energy&#8208;filtered transmission electron microscopy reveal the well&#8208;associated optical and electron signal at a high specificity, with an interspace of &#8776;41 &#197; of microtubule monomer in cells.

      <title>Sequential Electrodeposition of Bifunctional Catalytically Active Structures in MoO3/Ni&#8211;NiO Composite Electrocatalysts for Selective Hydrogen and Oxygen Evolution</title>
      <dc:description>
A new MoO3/Ni&#8211;NiO hybrid electrocatalyst is designed and synthesized via a novel sequential electrodeposition strategy, which exhibits excellent activity and durability for the overall water splitting process. Experimental and theoretical analysis demonstrate the improved hydrogen evolution performance should be mainly attributed to the Ni&#8211;NiO heterostructure, and the generated MoO3&#8211;NiO heterointerface is responsible for enhancing the oxygen evolution activity, synergistically facilitating bifunctional electrocatalysis.








Abstract
Exploring earth&#8208;abundant and highly efficient electrocatalysts is critical for further development of water electrolyzer systems. Integrating bifunctional catalytically active sites into one multi&#8208;component might greatly improve the overall water&#8208;splitting performance. In this work, amorphous NiO nanosheets coupled with ultrafine Ni and MoO3 nanoparticles (MoO3/Ni&#8211;NiO), which contains two heterostructures (i.e., Ni&#8211;NiO and MoO3&#8211;NiO), is fabricated via a novel sequential electrodeposition strategy. The as&#8208;synthesized MoO3/Ni&#8211;NiO composite exhibits superior electrocatalytic properties, affording low overpotentials of 62 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and 347 mV at 100 mA cm&#8722;2 for catalyzing the hydrogen and the oxygen evolution reaction (HER/OER), respectively. Moreover, the MoO3/Ni&#8211;NiO hybrid enables the overall alkaline water&#8208;splitting at a low cell voltage of 1.55 V to achieve 10 mA cm&#8722;2 with outstanding catalytic durability, significantly outperforming the noble&#8208;metal catalysts and many materials previously reported. Experimental and theoretical investigations collectively demonstrate the generated Ni&#8211;NiO and MoO3&#8211;NiO heterostructures significantly reduce the energetic barrier and act as catalytically active centers for selective HER and OER, synergistically accelerating the overall water&#8208;splitting process. This work helps to fundamentally understand the heterostructure&#8208;dependent mechanism, providing guidance for the rational design and oriented construction of hybrid nanomaterials for diverse catalytic processes.

      <title>Fabrication of CdS Frame&#8208;in&#8208;Cage Particles for Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Generation under Visible&#8208;Light Irradiation</title>
      <dc:description>
CdS frame&#8208;in&#8208;cage particles are fabricated through a two&#8208;step sulfidation approach. With the advantages of the novel hollow structure, the CdS frame&#8208;in&#8208;cage particles exhibit enhanced photocatalytic activity toward H2 generation compared with CdS cubes and cages.








Abstract
The design of advanced structures for semiconductor photocatalysts is an effective approach to enhance their performance toward solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion. Hollow and frame&#8208;like structures show advantageous features for photocatalytic reactions with enlarged surface area, shortened charge&#8208;transfer distance, promoted light&#8208;absorption ability, and enhanced mass&#8208;transfer capability. Here, a facile two&#8208;step sulfidation strategy is developed to fabricate unique CdS frame&#8208;in&#8208;cage particles for photocatalytic hydrogen generation. Cd&#8208;based Prussian blue analog (Cd&#8208;PBA) cubes are first converted to Cd&#8208;PBA cube&#8208;in&#8208;CdS cage particles, which are further transformed to CdS frame&#8208;in&#8208;cage particles. Benefiting from the novel frame&#8208;in&#8208;cage structure, the obtained CdS photocatalyst exhibits high activity under visible&#8208;light irradiation with the hydrogen generation rate of 13.6&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1, which is much enhanced compared with those of the CdS cubes and cages.

      <title>Recent Progress on Topological Structures in Ferroic Thin Films and Heterostructures</title>
      <dc:description>
The timely advance and breakthrough of topological structures (domain walls, flux&#8208;closure domains, vortices, skyrmions, etc.) in ferroic (i.e., ferroelectric, magnetic, and multiferroic) thin films and heterostructures over the past decade is demonstrated. The emergent properties and their multifield manipulations of these topological spin/polar structures hold great promise for the future energy&#8208;efficient nanoelectric and spintronic devices.








Abstract
Topological spin/polarization structures in ferroic materials continue to draw great attention as a result of their fascinating physical behaviors and promising applications in the field of high&#8208;density nonvolatile memories as well as future energy&#8208;efficient nanoelectronic and spintronic devices. Such developments have been made, in part, based on recent advances in theoretical calculations, the synthesis of high&#8208;quality thin films, and the characterization of their emergent phenomena and exotic phases. Herein, progress over the last decade in the study of topological structures in ferroic thin films and heterostructures is explored, including the observation of topological structures and control of their structures and emergent physical phenomena through epitaxial strain, layer thickness, electric, magnetic fields, etc. First, the evolution of topological spin structures (e.g., magnetic skyrmions) and associated functionalities (e.g., topological Hall effect) in magnetic thin films and heterostructures is discussed. Then, the exotic polar topologies (e.g., domain walls, closure domains, polar vortices, bubble domains, and polar skyrmions) and their emergent physical properties in ferroelectric oxide films and heterostructures are explored. Finally, a brief overview and prospectus of how the field may evolve in the coming years is provided.

      <dc:description>
Highly efficient temperature&#8208;dependent&#8208;aggregation polymer&#8208;based organic solar cells are fabricated by hot slot&#8208;die coating with hydrocarbon solvents. PCEs of 15.2%, 15.4%, and 15.6% are obtained when chlorobenzene, 1,2,4&#8208;trimethylbenzene (TMB), and ortho&#8208;xylene are used, respectively.








Abstract
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have made rapid progress in terms of their development as a sustainable energy source. However, record&#8208;breaking devices have not shown compatibility with large&#8208;scale production via solution processing in particular due to the use of halogenated environment&#8208;threatening solvents. Here, slot&#8208;die fabrication with processing involving hydrocarbon&#8208;based solvents is used to realize highly efficient and environmentally friendly OSCs. Highly compatible slot&#8208;die coating with roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll processing using halogenated (chlorobenzene (CB)) and hydrocarbon solvents (1,2,4&#8208;trimethylbenzene (TMB) and ortho&#8208;xylene (o&#8208;XY)) is used to fabricate photoactive films. Controlled solution and substrate temperatures enable similar aggregation states in the solution and similar kinetics processes during film formation. The optimized blend film nanostructures for different solvents in the highly efficient PM6:Y6 blend is adopted to show a similar morphology, which results in device efficiencies of 15.2%, 15.4%, and 15.6% for CB, TMB, and o&#8208;XY solvents. This approach is successfully extended to other donor&#8211;acceptor combinations to demonstrate the excellent universality of this method. The results combine a method to optimize the aggregation state and film formation kinetics with the fabrication of OSCs with environmentally friendly solvents by slot&#8208;die coating, which is a critical finding for the future development of OSCs in terms of their scalable production and high&#8208;performance.

      <title>T&#8208;Cell&#8208;Mimicking Nanoparticles for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
      <dc:description>
T&#8208;cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;coated nanoparticles (TCMNPs) are developed for cancer immunotherapy. The TCMNPs can be targeted at tumors and kill cancer cells while being resistant to the pro&#8208;tumoral factors in the tumor microenvironment. Indeed, the TCMNPs exhibit a higher therapeutic efficacy than current cancer treatments based on immune checkpoint blockade, and they are effective for the treatment of various tumors.








Abstract
Cancer immunotherapies, including adoptive T cell transfer and immune checkpoint blockades, have recently shown considerable success in cancer treatment. Nevertheless, transferred T cells often become exhausted because of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Immune checkpoint blockades, in contrast, can reinvigorate the exhausted T cells; however, the therapeutic efficacy is modest in 70&#8211;80% of patients. To address some of the challenges faced by the current cancer treatments, here T&#8208;cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;coated nanoparticles (TCMNPs) are developed for cancer immunotherapy. Similar to cytotoxic T cells, TCMNPs can be targeted at tumors via T&#8208;cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;originated proteins and kill cancer cells by releasing anticancer molecules and inducing Fas&#8208;ligand&#8208;mediated apoptosis. Unlike cytotoxic T cells, TCMNPs are resistant to immunosuppressive molecules (e.g., transforming growth factor&#8208;&#946;1 (TGF&#8208;&#946;1)) and programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) of cancer cells by scavenging TGF&#8208;&#946;1 and PD&#8208;L1. Indeed, TCMNPs exhibit higher therapeutic efficacy than an immune checkpoint blockade in melanoma treatment. Furthermore, the anti&#8208;tumoral actions of TCMNPs are also demonstrated in the treatment of lung cancer in an antigen&#8208;nonspecific manner. Taken together, TCMNPs have a potential to improve the current cancer immunotherapy.

      <title>Lithium/Sulfide All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries using Sulfide Electrolytes</title>
      <dc:description>
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries are considered to be next&#8208;generation devices for electrochemical energy storages due to their superiority in high safety and energy density. The sulfide electrolytes have become one of the most promising ion conductors due to their high ionic conductivities. At the same time, the favorable interface compatibility of sulfide electrolytes with sulfide&#8208;based cathodes delivers bright prospect of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs) are considered as the next generation electrochemical energy storage devices because of their high safety and energy density, simple packaging, and wide operable temperature range. The critical component in ASSLBs is the solid&#8208;state electrolyte. Among all solid&#8208;state electrolytes, the sulfide electrolytes have the highest ionic conductivity and favorable interface compatibility with sulfur&#8208;based cathodes. The ionic conductivity of sulfide electrolytes is comparable with or even higher than that of the commercial organic liquid electrolytes. However, several critical challenges for sulfide electrolytes still remain to be solved, including their narrow electrochemical stability window, the unstable interface between the electrolyte and the electrodes, as well as lithium dendrite formation in the electrolytes. Herein, the emerging sulfide electrolytes and preparation methods are reviewed. In particular, the required properties of the sulfide electrolytes, such as the electrochemical stabilities of the electrolytes and the compatible electrode/electrolyte interfaces are highlighted. The opportunities for sulfide&#8208;based ASSLBs are also discussed.

      <title>Electron Beam Lithography of Magnetic Skyrmions</title>
      <dc:description>
A new, yet general, approach to the &#8220;printing&#8221; of skyrmions with zero&#8208;field stability in arbitrary patterns is demonstrated. By exploiting the thermal reconfigurability of an antiferromagnet, skyrmion lithography can be achieved by writing with a focused electron beam. The work on skyrmion printing will enable the exploration of topological magnetism.








Abstract
The emergence of magnetic skyrmions, topological spin textures, has aroused tremendous interest in studying the rich physics related to their topology. While skyrmions promise high&#8208;density and energy&#8208;efficient magnetic memory devices for information technology, the manifestation of their nontrivial topology through single skyrmions and ordered and disordered skyrmion lattices could also give rise to many fascinating physical phenomena, such as chiral magnon and skyrmion glass states. Therefore, generating skyrmions at designated locations on a large scale, while controlling the skyrmion patterns, is the key to advancing topological magnetism. Here, a new, yet general, approach to the &#8220;printing&#8221; of skyrmions with zero&#8208;field stability in arbitrary patterns on a massive scale in exchange&#8208;biased magnetic multilayers is presented. By exploiting the fact that the antiferromagnetic order can be reconfigured by local thermal excitations, a focused electron beam with a graphic pattern generator to &#8220;print&#8221; skyrmions is used, which is referred to as skyrmion lithography. This work provides a route to design arbitrary skyrmion patterns, thereby establishing the foundation for further exploration of topological magnetism.

      <title>Orientation&#8208;Dependent Host&#8211;Dopant Interactions for Manipulating Charge Transport in Conjugated Polymers</title>
      <dc:description>
Surface doping of a conjugated polymer is drastically modulated by molecular orientation. Face&#8208;on orientation presents more reaction sites for dopant/host interactions, leading to effective charge trap filling facilitated by efficient vertical transport down to conductive channel. Hole mobility increases by fivefold to 3 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 in the face&#8208;on case, compared to a minimal change in the edge&#8208;on case.








Abstract
Molecular orientation plays a critical role in controlling carrier transport in organic semiconductors (OSCs). However, this aspect has not been explored for surface doping of OSC thin films. The challenge lies in lack of methods to precisely modulate relative molecular orientation between the dopant and the OSC host. Here, the impact of molecular orientation on dopant&#8211;host electronic interactions by large modulation of conjugated polymer orientation via solution coating is reported. Combining synchrotron&#8208;radiation X&#8208;ray measurements with spectroscopic and electrical characterizations, a quantitative correlation between doping&#8208;enhanced charge carrier mobility and the Herman's orientation parameter is presented. This direct correlation can be attributed to enhanced charge&#8208;transfer interactions at host/dopant interface with increasing face&#8208;on orientation of the polymer. These results demonstrate that the surface doping effect can be fundamentally manipulated by controlling the molecular orientation of the OSC layer, enabling optimization of carrier transport.

      <title>A Machine&#8208;Fabricated 3D Honeycomb&#8208;Structured Flame&#8208;Retardant Triboelectric Fabric for Fire Escape and Rescue</title>
      <dc:description>
A multifunctional 3D honeycomb&#8208;structure fabric triboelectric nanogenerator (3D F&#8208;TENG) is fabricated from yarn to fabric by scalable and continuous textile fabrication technology. The 3D F&#8208;TENG can be used as a smart indoor carpet, which has functions of flame retardancy, noise reduction, precise rescue location, and real&#8208;time route guidance under fire conditions.








Abstract
Fire disaster is one of the most common hazards that threaten public safety and social development: how to improve the fire escape and rescue capacity remains a huge challenge. Here, a 3D honeycomb&#8208;structured woven fabric triboelectric nanogenerator (F&#8208;TENG) based on a flame&#8208;retardant wrapping yarn is developed. The wrapping yarn is fabricated through a continuous hollow spindle fancy twister technology, which is compatible with traditional textile production processes. The resulting 3D F&#8208;TENG can be used in smart carpets as a self&#8208;powered escape and rescue system that can precisely locate the survivor position and point out the escape route to timely assist victim search and rescuing. As interior decoration, the unique design of the honeycomb weaving structure endows the F&#8208;TENG fabric with an excellent noise&#8208;reduction ability. In addition, combining with its good machine washability, air permeability, flame&#8208;retardency, durability, and repeatability features, the 3D F&#8208;TENG may have great potential applications in fire rescue and wearable sensors as well as smart home decoration.

      <title>Atomically Thin Hexagonal Boron Nitride and Its Heterostructures</title>
      <dc:description>
Hexagonal boron nitride is superior for application in van der Waals optoelectronics and electronics. Recent achievements in the synthesis of large&#8208;scale, single&#8208;crystal h&#8208;BN film and its heterostructures via chemical vapor deposition are summarized and the growth kinetics are discussed, emphasizing that the specific orientation of the heterostructure constituents can introduce novel properties. Typical applications in electronics and optoelectronics are summarized.








Abstract
Atomically thin hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) is an emerging star of 2D materials. It is taken as an optimal substrate for other 2D&#8208;material&#8208;based devices owing to its atomical flatness, absence of dangling bonds, and excellent stability. Specifically, h&#8208;BN is found to be a natural hyperbolic material in the mid&#8208;infrared range, as well as a piezoelectric material. All the unique properties are beneficial for novel applications in optoelectronics and electronics. Currently, most of these applications are merely based on exfoliated h&#8208;BN flakes at their proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept stages. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is considered as the most promising approach for producing large&#8208;scale, high&#8208;quality, atomically thin h&#8208;BN films and heterostructures. Herein, CVD synthesis of atomically thin h&#8208;BN is the focus. Also, the growth kinetics are systematically investigated to point out general strategies for controllable and scalable preparation of single&#8208;crystal h&#8208;BN film. Meanwhile, epitaxial growth of 2D materials onto h&#8208;BN and at its edge to construct heterostructures is summarized, emphasizing that the specific orientation of constituent parts in heterostructures can introduce novel properties. Finally, recent applications of atomically thin h&#8208;BN and its heterostructures in optoelectronics and electronics are summarized.

      <title>Organic Nanocomposites: Supramolecular Porous Organic Nanocomposites for Heterogeneous Photocatalysis of a Sulfur Mustard Simulant (Adv. Mater. 32/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
Manipulating the excited&#8208;state evolution in host&#8211;guest complexes is of importance in developing new applications for organic molecular materials. In particular, the efficient production of triplet&#8208;excited states in organic compounds upon light photoexcitation is of interest because of its wide range of applications. In article number 2001592, Joseph T. Hupp, J. Fraser Stoddart, and co&#8208;workers report new organic nanocomposites that combine both porosity and efficient photosensitizing properties for the detoxification of Sulfur Mustard simulant.

      <title>Perovskite Photodetectors: Perovskite Granular Wire Photodetectors with Ultrahigh Photodetectivity (Adv. Mater. 32/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article number 2002357, Sang Kyu Kwak, Joon Hak Oh, and co&#8208;workers synthesize perovskite granular wires by a simple yet effective template&#8208;free self&#8208;assembly. Superb photodetection performance with unprecedentedly high photodetectivity is exhibited, which originates from the low dark current due to the band&#8208;edge modulation along the long axis of the granular wires. This &#8220;self&#8208;assembled nanograin engineering&#8221; strategy provides a viable method for the development of high&#8208;performance perovskite photodetectors and can be extended to other integrated optoelectronic systems.

In article number 2002292, Xinwen Peng, Jun Lu, and co&#8208;workers report the design of mechanically flexible carbon monoliths with much enhanced electrocatalytic activity, which facilitate gas/electrolyte diffusion channels as a novel 3D air electrode. Wood&#8208;derived cellulose nanofibers combined with graphene are used to construct an integrated porous carbon aerogel by directional freeze&#8208;casting and multiple modification. With its superb ORR and OER activity, this material shows remarkable performance as the free&#8208;standing air cathode in energy&#8208;storage systems, including flow metal&#8211;air batteries and flexible solid&#8208;state metal&#8211;air batteries.

In article number 2000960, Yang Jin, Hui Wu, Yi Cui, and co&#8208;workers design a garnet&#8208;type Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;based molten lithium&#8211;molybdenum&#8211;iron(II) chloride battery. Different from the conventional reaction mechanism of batteries, this battery synchronizes the reversible Fe&#8211;Mo alloying&#8211;dealloying reactions with the delithiation&#8211;lithiation processes, meaning that the porous Mo skeleton derived from the dealloying reaction can suppress the growth of pure Fe particles. This approach is promising for other alkali metal&#8211;metal chloride battery systems.

      <title>Perovskite Solar Cells: Surface Ligand Management Aided by a Secondary Amine Enables Increased Synthesis Yield of CsPbI3 Perovskite Quantum Dots and High Photovoltaic Performance (Adv. Mater. 32/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
Emerging all&#8208;inorganic CsPbI3 perovskite quantum dots offer colloidal synthesis and processing using industrially friendly solvents. This is desirable for solar&#8208;cell applications and will catalyze new structures for optoelectronic devices. In article number 2000449, Jianyu Yuan, Wanli Ma, and co&#8208;workers report the development of a new surface ligand management strategy, which improves on the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art efficiency of CsPbI3 quantum&#8208;dot solar cells.
