      <title>High&#8208;Throughput Growth of Wafer&#8208;Scale Monolayer Transition Metal Dichalcogenide via Vertical Ostwald Ripening</title>
      <dc:description>
High&#8208;throughput growth of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is developed on 6&#8208;inch wafer scale. Periodically interrupting the precursor supply drives lateral growth via the surface diffusion of adatoms on the pre&#8208;synthesized TMDs (vertical Ostwald ripening). The as&#8208;grown TMD possesses high crystallinity with well&#8208;stitched grains, and uniform electrical properties even after transfer by an etching&#8208;free de&#8208;bonding and bonding process.








Abstract
For practical device applications, monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) films must meet key industry needs for batch processing, including the high&#8208;throughput, large&#8208;scale production of high&#8208;quality, spatially uniform materials, and reliable integration into devices. Here, high&#8208;throughput growth, completed in 12 min, of 6&#8208;inch wafer&#8208;scale monolayer MoS2 and WS2 is reported, which is directly compatible with scalable batch processing and device integration. Specifically, a pulsed metal&#8211;organic chemical vapor deposition process is developed, where periodic interruption of the precursor supply drives vertical Ostwald ripening, which prevents secondary nucleation despite high precursor concentrations. The as&#8208;grown TMD films show excellent spatial homogeneity and well&#8208;stitched grain boundaries, enabling facile transfer to various target substrates without degradation. Using these films, batch fabrication of high&#8208;performance field&#8208;effect transistor (FET) arrays in wafer&#8208;scale is demonstrated, and the FETs show remarkable uniformity. The high&#8208;throughput production and wafer&#8208;scale automatable transfer will facilitate the integration of TMDs into Si&#8208;complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor platforms.

      <title>Nanoconfined Water&#8208;Molecule Channels for High&#8208;Yield Solar Vapor Generation under Weaker Sunlight</title>
      <dc:description>
Hydrophobic nanoconfined water&#8208;molecule channels are demonstrated to reduce water vaporization enthalpy in solar vapor generation (SVG) using both experimental methods and theoretical simulations. Under 0.5 sun irradiation, this designed evaporator achieves the record SVG rate of 1.25&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1. Furthermore, the evaporator can be applied in the water&#8208;purification process with high vapor yields.








Abstract
Solar vapor generation is a promising method to efficiently produce fresh water. However, the insufficient vapor yields under natural daylight restrict its practical applications, and the basic evaporation mechanisms are deficient for reasonable design of evaporator structure. Here, hydrophobic nano&#8208;confined water molecule channels (NCWMCs) are demonstrated, which can reduce the vaporization enthalpy for water evaporation and achieve a record vapor generation rate of 1.25&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 under 0.5 sun irradiation. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal the cluster&#8208;evaporation process in the NCWMC system. As a result, the evaporator with NCWMC system can effectively purify seawater and wastewater samples using this environmentally friendly strategy.

      <title>Bioinspired Adhesion: Multiple Mechanical Gradients are Responsible for the Strong Adhesion of Spider Attachment Hair (Adv. Mater. 37/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
Nanostructured adhesive hairs on the feet of spiders are responsible for strong adhesion, enabling the animals to walk vertically and upside down. In article number 2002758, Clemens F. Schaber, Martin M&#252;ller, and co&#8208;workers use scanning nanofocus X&#8208;ray scattering under force control to elucidate the mechanism of alignment and consequently strong attachment of the nanostructures to a glass surface. The spider attachment system is a promising model for the development of powerful residue&#8208;free dry adhesives.

      <dc:description>
Similar to placing a carpet on a staircase, terraced graphene is formed by stacking a layer of graphene on an atomically terraced substrate. This leads to topographic corrugations and charge puddles in the terraced graphene. In the presence of a magnetic field, its resistance can change as high as 5000% at room temperature, paving a route for extremely sensitive and high&#8208;resolution magnetic sensors, as revealed by Ariando Ariando and co&#8208;workers in article number 2002201.

In the presence of a magnetic field, its resistance can change as high as 5000% at room temperature, paving a route for extremely sensitive and high&#8208;resolution magnetic sensors, as revealed by Ariando Ariando and co&#8208;workers in article number &lt;a&gt;https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.2020022012002201&lt;/a&gt;.

In article number 2002251, Lei Ye, Hai&#8208;Rong Zheng, Jian&#8208;Bin Xu, Gary J. Cheng, Xue&#8208;Feng Zhu, and co&#8208;workers implement a microstructured meta&#8208;skin insulator to reflect acoustic waves in an all&#8208;angle and wide spectrum range, due to the tremendous impedance mismatch at the superhydrophobic air/water interface. This strategy in particular, has application potential for underwater acoustic metamaterials, since the detrimental solid&#8211;fluid coupling can be substantially diminished by coating the metaskin insulator on the designed metastructure.

      <title>Electrical Dynamic Switching of Magnetic Plasmon Resonance Based on Selective Lithium Deposition</title>
      <dc:description>
The first self&#8208;powered electrical dynamic switching of magnetic plasmon resonance (MPR) based on lithium deposition in a lithium metal battery is performed. With the precisely designed silver&#8208;based metal&#8211;insulator&#8211;metal (MIM) structure, dynamic optical switching between MPR and surface plasmon polariton excitations is realized via an electrochemical charging and discharging process, leading to a reconfigurable structure transformation from discontinuous MIM to semi&#8208;infinite metallic grating.








Abstract
Active plasmonic nanostructures have garnered considerable interest in physics, chemistry, and material science due to the dynamically switchable capability of plasmonic responses. Here, the first electrically dynamic control of magnetic plasmon resonance (MPR) through structure transformation by selective deposition of lithium on a metal&#8211;insulator&#8211;metal (MIM) structure is reported. Distinct optical switching between MPR and surface plasmon polariton (SPP) excitations can be enabled by applying a proper electrical current to the electrochemical cell. Furthermore, the structure transformation through lithium metal deposition indicates the reconfigurable MPR excitation in a full cycling of the charging and discharging process. The results may shed light on electrically compatible self&#8208;powered active plasmonics as well as nondestructive optical sensing for electrochemical evolution.

      <title>Metal&#8208;Free Halide Perovskite Single Crystals with Very Long Charge Lifetimes for Efficient X&#8208;ray Imaging</title>
      <dc:description>
A large size single&#8208;crystal metal&#8208;free perovskite DABCO&#8208;NH4Br3 is grown. The crystal exhibits a large semigap of &#8776;16 eV and an extremely long lifetime approaching the millisecond regime, which enables high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray response and imaging with sensitivity up to 173 &#956;C Gyair&#8722;1.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;free halide perovskites, as a specific category of the perovskite family, have recently emerged as novel semiconductors for organic ferroelectrics and promise the wide chemical diversity of the ABX3 perovskite structure with mechanical flexibility, light weight, and eco&#8208;friendly processing. However, after the initial discovery 17 years ago, there has been no experimental information about their charge transport properties and only one brief mention of their optoelectronic properties. Here, growth of large single crystals of metal&#8208;free halide perovskite DABCO&#8208;NH4Br3 (DABCO = N&#8208;N&#8242;&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octonium) is reported together with characterization of their instrinsic optical and electronic properties and demonstration, of metal&#8208;free halide perovskite optoelectronics. The results reveal that the crystals have an unusually large semigap of &#8776;16 eV and a specific band nature with the valence band maximum and the conduction band minimum mainly dominated by the halide and DABCO2+, respectively. The unusually large semigap rationalizes extremely long lifetimes approaching the millisecond regime, leading to very high charge diffusion lengths (tens of &#181;m). The crystals also exhibit high X&#8208;ray attenuation as well as being lightweight. All these properties translate to high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray imaging with sensitivity up to 173 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2. This makes metal&#8208;free perovskites novel candidates for the next generation of optoelectronics.

      <title>500 Wh kg&#8722;1 Class Li Metal Battery Enabled by a Self&#8208;Organized Core&#8211;Shell Composite Anode</title>
      <dc:description>
A self&#8208;organized core&#8211;shell composite anode, which contains an outer sheath of lithiated liquid metal and an inner layer of Li metal, is reported. Benefiting from the composite anode that prevents the dendrite formation and eliminates the use of copper as substrates, full cells that pair the composite anode with a commercially available cathode deliver ultrahigh energy density exceeding 500 Wh kg&#8722;1.








Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal offers the highest projected energy density as a battery anode, however its extremely high reactivity induces dendrite growth and dead Li formation during repeated charge/discharge processes, resulting in both poor reversibility and catastrophic failure. Approaches reported to date often seek to suppress dendrites formation at the expense of energy density. Here, a strategy that resolves the above conflict and achieves a dendrite&#8208;free and long&#8208;term reversible Li metal anode is reported. A self&#8208;organized core&#8211;shell composite anode, comprising an outer sheath of lithiated liquid metal (LixLMy) and an inner layer of Li metal, is developed, which posesses high electrical and ionic conductivity, and physically separates Li from the electrolyte. The introduction of LixLMy not only prevents dendrite formation, but also eliminates the use of copper as an inert substrate. Full cells made of such composite anodes and commercially available LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 (NCM622) cathodes deliver ultrahigh energy density of 1500 Wh L&#8722;1 and 483 Wh kg&#8722;1. The high capacity can be maintained for more than 500 cycles, with fading rate of less than 0.05% per cycle. Pairing with LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) further raises the energy density to 1732 Wh L&#8722;1 and 514 Wh kg&#8722;1.

      <title>Rashba Effect in Functional Spintronic Devices</title>
      <dc:description>
The Rashba effect provides fascinating functionality for electronic devices because of the electric modulation of spin orientation. This work focuses on semiconductor spin transistors and spin&#8211;orbit torque devices. Recent theories and experiments related to generating and controlling spin current are presented. Future directions in the development of spin logic and memory devices are also discussed.








Abstract
Exploiting spin transport increases the functionality of electronic devices and enables such devices to overcome physical limitations related to speed and power. Utilizing the Rashba effect at the interface of heterostructures provides promising opportunities toward the development of high&#8208;performance devices because it enables electrical control of the spin information. Herein, the focus is mainly on progress related to the two most compelling devices that exploit the Rashba effect: spin transistors and spin&#8211;orbit torque devices. For spin field&#8208;effect transistors, the gate&#8208;voltage manipulation of the Rashba effect and subsequent control of the spin precession are discussed, including for all&#8208;electric spin field&#8208;effect transistors. For spin&#8211;orbit torque devices, recent theories and experiments on interface&#8208;generated spin current are discussed. The future directions of manipulating the Rashba effect to realize fully integrated spin logic and memory devices are also discussed.

      <title>Rational Design of Semiconductor&#8208;Based Chemiresistors and their Libraries for Next&#8208;Generation Artificial Olfaction</title>
      <dc:description>
A variety of material design strategies are investigated for the realization of next&#8208;generation artificial olfaction. Inspired by the mammalian olfactory system, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electronic noses will have diverse material libraries coupled with advanced signal processors that can replace and/or surpass the human olfactory system. These electronic noses are expected to be applicable to numerous on&#8208;demand application fields.








Abstract
Artificial olfaction based on gas sensor arrays aims to substitute for, support, and surpass human olfaction. Like mammalian olfaction, a larger number of sensors and more signal processing are crucial for strengthening artificial olfaction. Due to rapid progress in computing capabilities and machine&#8208;learning algorithms, on&#8208;demand high&#8208;performance artificial olfaction that can eclipse human olfaction becomes inevitable once diverse and versatile gas sensing materials are provided. Here, rational strategies to design a myriad of different semiconductor&#8208;based chemiresistors and to grow gas sensing libraries enough to identify a wide range of odors and gases are reviewed, discussed, and suggested. Key approaches include the use of p&#8208;type oxide semiconductors, multinary perovskite and spinel oxides, carbon&#8208;based materials, metal chalcogenides, their heterostructures, as well as heterocomposites as distinctive sensing materials, the utilization of bilayer sensor design, the design of robust sensing materials, and the high&#8208;throughput screening of sensing materials. In addition, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art and key issues in the implementation of electronic noses are discussed. Finally, a perspective on chemiresistive sensing materials for next&#8208;generation artificial olfaction is provided.

      <title>Artificial Skin Perception</title>
      <dc:description>
Artificial skin perception that integrates the perception functionality into a flexible and stretchable sensing system could endow current flexible electronic devices with higher intelligence. The recent progress, challenges, and perspects of artificial skin perception are discussed, offering some inspiration for the development of next&#8208;generation intelligent systems, especially soft robotics.








Abstract
Skin is the largest organ, with the functionalities of protection, regulation, and sensation. The emulation of human skin via flexible and stretchable electronics gives rise to electronic skin (e&#8208;skin), which has realized artificial sensation and other functions that cannot be achieved by conventional electronics. To date, tremendous progress has been made in data acquisition and transmission for e&#8208;skin systems, while the implementation of perception within systems, that is, sensory data processing, is still in its infancy. Integrating the perception functionality into a flexible and stretchable sensing system, namely artificial skin perception, is critical to endow current e&#8208;skin systems with higher intelligence. Here, recent progress in the design and fabrication of artificial skin perception devices and systems is summarized, and challenges and prospects are discussed. The strategies for implementing artificial skin perception utilize either conventional silicon&#8208;based circuits or novel flexible computing devices such as memristive devices and synaptic transistors, which enable artificial skin to surpass human skin, with a distributed, low&#8208;latency, and energy&#8208;efficient information&#8208;processing ability. In future, artificial skin perception would be a new enabling technology to construct next&#8208;generation intelligent electronic devices and systems for advanced applications, such as robotic surgery, rehabilitation, and prosthetics.

      <title>Crystalline Porous Organic Salts: From Micropore to Hierarchical Pores</title>
      <dc:description>
An overview of recent achievements in the synthetic approaches, structural features, and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art applications of crystalline porous organic salts (CPOSs) and a perspective on the construction of the porous hierarchy within the CPOS frameworks are described.








Abstract
Crystalline porous organic salts (CPOSs), as an emerging class of porous organic materials, combining the uniform microporous system and distinct polarized channels, have become a highly evolving field of important current interest. The unique ionic bond of a CPOS endows the confined channels with high polarity, making CPOSs distinct from other organic frameworks. CPOSs show many fascinating properties, such as proton conductivity and fast transport of polar molecules, which involve the interaction between highly polarized guest molecules and host frameworks. Substantial progress has been made in the synthesis and applications of CPOSs. Herein, an overview is provided to impart a comprehensive understanding of the link between the synthetic approaches and the resultant microporous structure, the structure&#8211;function correlation and the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art applications of CPOSs. The enhanced mass&#8208;transport performance of hierarchically porous structure in combination with the intrinsic polarized channels of CPOSs is very promising to create new applications and contribute to a new research upsurge. The perspective to construct porous hierarchy within the crystalline porous organic salts is assessed and will open a new research avenue. In the conclusion, the current challenges on the synthesis, structural regulation, and applications of CPOSs and the future of hierarchically porous crystalline organic salts are discussed.

      <title>Strain&#8208;Sensitive Magnetization Reversal of a van der Waals Magnet</title>
      <dc:description>
An ultrasensitive magnetization reversal in the van der Waals magnet Fe3GeTe2 is realized by strain. Remarkably increased coercive field, Curie temperature, and transition temperature between single&#8208; and labyrinthine&#8208;domain states under tensile strain are also observed. The strain&#8208;tunable magnetism could result from the sensitive change of magnetic anisotropy energy with the theoretical results.








Abstract
By virtue of the layered structure, van der Waals (vdW) magnets are sensitive to the lattice deformation controlled by the external strain, providing an ideal platform to explore the one&#8208;step magnetization reversal that is still conceptual in conventional magnets due to the limited strain&#8208;tuning range of the coercive field. In this study, a uniaxial tensile strain is applied to thin flakes of the vdW magnet Fe3GeTe2 (FGT), and a dramatic increase of the coercive field (Hc) by more than 150% with an applied strain of 0.32% is observed. Moreover, the change of the transition temperatures between the different magnetic phases under strain is investigated, and the phase diagram of FGT in the strain&#8211;temperature plane is obtained. Comparing the phase diagram with theoretical results, the strain&#8208;tunable magnetism is attributed to the sensitive change of magnetic anisotropy energy. Remarkably, strain allows an ultrasensitive magnetization reversal to be achieved, which may promote the development of novel straintronic device applications.

     alt="Strain&#8208;Sensitive Magnetization Reversal of a van der Waals Magnet"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ultrasensitive magnetization reversal in the van der Waals magnet Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;GeTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is realized by strain. Remarkably increased coercive field, Curie temperature, and transition temperature between single&#8208; and labyrinthine&#8208;domain states under tensile strain are also observed. The strain&#8208;tunable magnetism could result from the sensitive change of magnetic anisotropy energy with the theoretical results.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By virtue of the layered structure, van der Waals (vdW) magnets are sensitive to the lattice deformation controlled by the external strain, providing an ideal platform to explore the one&#8208;step magnetization reversal that is still conceptual in conventional magnets due to the limited strain&#8208;tuning range of the coercive field. In this study, a uniaxial tensile strain is applied to thin flakes of the vdW magnet Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;GeTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (FGT), and a dramatic increase of the coercive field (&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;) by more than 150% with an applied strain of 0.32% is observed. Moreover, the change of the transition temperatures between the different magnetic phases under strain is investigated, and the phase diagram of FGT in the strain&#8211;temperature plane is obtained. Comparing the phase diagram with theoretical results, the strain&#8208;tunable magnetism is attributed to the sensitive change of magnetic anisotropy energy. Remarkably, strain allows an ultrasensitive magnetization reversal to be achieved, which may promote the development of novel straintronic device applications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Review on Micro/Nanoforming to Fabricate 3D Metallic Structures</title>
      <dc:description>
A systematic review on micro/nanoforming processes for the fabrication of 3D metallic structures with multifunctional properties is presented. The latest advances in achieving such microbulk forming, microsheet forming, energy&#8208;field microforming processes, 3D nanoprinting, and nanoforming with remarkably innovative methods are described.








Abstract
With the rapid development of micro&#8208;electromechanical systems (MEMS), micro/nanoscale fabrication of 3D metallic structures with complex structures and multifunctions is becoming more and more important due to the recent trend of product miniaturization. As a promising micromanufacturing approach based on plastic deformation, micro/nanoforming shows the attractive advantages of high productivity, low cost, near&#8208;net&#8208;shape, and excellent mechanical properties, compared with other non&#8208;silicon&#8208;based micromanufacturing technologies. However, micro/nanoforming is far less established due to the so&#8208;called size effects in terms of materials models, process laws, tooling design, etc. The understanding of basic issues on micro/nanoforming is not yet mature, and it is currently a topic of rigorous investigation. Here, a systematic review on the micro/nanoforming processes of 3D structures with multifunctional properties is presented, wherein also a critical examination of the interplay between relevant length scales and size effects affecting the structural integrity of micro/mesoscale metallic systems is also provided. Finally, the challenges of micro/nanoscale fabrication are proposed, including the development trends of new micro/nanoforming processes, multiple field coupling effects, and theoretical modeling at the trans&#8208;scale.

The afforded materials present combined features of stimuli&#8208;responsiveness of pillar[n]arene&#8208;based switches and intrinsic properties of solid supports and show applications in various aspects.








Abstract
The design and synthesis of new synthetic macrocycles has driven the rapid development of supramolecular chemistry and materials. Pillar[n]arenes, as a new type of macrocyclic compounds, are used as a promising type of building blocks for switchable supramolecular systems due to their versatile functionalization and the ability of binding toward various guest molecules. A number of guests can form inclusion complexes with pillar[n]arenes and their derivatives in solution, which are sensitive to different external triggers. Interestingly, the pursuit of complex stimuli&#8208;responsive functional materials and devices has largely motivated the shift of pillar[n]arene&#8208;based switches from solution media to surfaces for controllable macroscopic motions on solid platforms. Facilitated by the facile modification of pillar[n]arenes on various solid supports and the dynamic binding of host&#8211;guest complexes, numerous functional hybrid materials with adjustable physical or chemical properties and integrated functionalities have been reported in the last decade. Here, the advance of supramolecular switches in solution and on surfaces based on pillar[n]arenes and derivatives with an emphasis on the efforts and the latest contributions from the field is discussed.

      <title>The Key Role of Intrinsic Lifetime Dynamics from Upconverting Nanosystems in Multiemission Particle Velocimetry</title>
      <dc:description>
Multiemission particle velocimetry exploits the intrinsic luminescence dynamics of different lanthanide ions in core&#8211;shell upconverting nanoparticles. These nanoprobes show sequential emissions within known time intervals, providing simultaneous measurements of time and distance of flowing particles with a single probe. This new method results in great accuracy and improved flexibility in the determination of flow velocities compared to previously established methods.








Abstract
Evaluation of particle dynamics at the nano&#8208; and microscale poses a challenge to the development of novel velocimetry techniques. Established optical methods implement external or internal calibrations of the emission profiles by varying the particle velocity and are limited to specific experimental conditions. The proposed multiemission particle velocimetry approach aims to introduce a new concept for a luminescent probe, which guarantees accurate velocity measurements at the microscale, independent of the particle concentration or experimental setup, and without need for calibration. The simplicity of these analyses relies on the intrinsic luminescence dynamics of core&#8211;shell upconverting nanoparticles. Upon excitation with a focused near&#8208;infrared pulsed laser, the nanoparticle emits photons at different wavelengths. The time interval between emissions from different excited states is independent of the local environment or particle velocity. The velocity of the particles is calculated by measuring the distance between the maxima of two different emissions and dividing it by the known difference in luminescence lifetimes. This method is demonstrated using simple digital imaging of nanoparticles flowing in 75&#8211;150 &#181;m diameter capillaries. Using this novel approach typically results in a relative standard deviation of the experimental velocities of 5% or lower without any calibration.

Degeneration of dopaminergic neurons is a most common age&#8208;related disorder in central nervous system.

Abstract
The degeneration of dopaminergic neurons is a major contributor to the pathogenesis of mid&#8208;brain disorders. Clinically, cell therapeutic solutions, by increasing the neurotransmitter dopamine levels in the patients, are hindered by low efficiency and/or side effects. Here, a strategy using electromagnetized nanoparticles to modulate neural plasticity and recover degenerative dopamine neurons in vivo is reported. Remarkably, electromagnetic fields generated by the nanoparticles under ultrasound stimulation modulate intracellular calcium signaling to influence synaptic plasticity and control neural behavior. Dopaminergic neuronal functions are reversed by upregulating the expression tyrosine hydroxylase, thus resulting in ameliorating the neural behavioral disorders in zebrafish. This wireless tool can serve as a viable and safe strategy for the regenerative therapy of the neurodegenerative disorders.

      <title>Creating an Eco&#8208;Friendly Building Coating with Smart Subambient Radiative Cooling</title>
      <dc:description>
A waterborne building coating with smart subambient radiative cooling (SSRC) is created based on a new design concept, which combines particle scattering, sunlight&#8208;excited fluorescence and mid&#8208;infrared broadband radiation. Consequently, conventional building&#8208;coating materials can be engineered at low cost to realize SSRC, facilitating an eco&#8208;friendly solution for widespread applications of the SSRC technology in buildings for improved human comfort.








Abstract
Subambient daytime radiative cooling (SDRC) provides a promising electricity&#8208; and cryogen&#8208;free pathway for global energy&#8208;efficiency. However, current SDRC systems require stringent surface designs, which are neither cost&#8208;effective nor eco&#8208;friendly, to selectively emit thermal radiation to outer space and simultaneously maximize solar reflectance. Here, a generic method is developed to upgrade the conventional building&#8208;coating materials with a peculiar self&#8208;adaptive SDRC effect through combining particle scattering, sunlight&#8208;excited fluorescence, and mid&#8208;infrared broadband radiation. It is also theoretically proved that heat exchange with the sky can eliminate the use of resonant microstructures and noble metal mirrors in conventional SDRC, and also leads to enhanced daytime cooling yet suppressed nighttime overcooling. When exposed to direct sunlight, the upgraded coating over an aluminum plate can achieve 6 &#176;C (7 &#176;C on a scale&#8208;model building) below the ambient temperature under a solar intensity of 744 W m&#8722;2 (850 W m&#8722;2), yielding a cooling power of 84.2 W m&#8722;2. The results pave the way for practical large&#8208;scale applications of high&#8208;performance SDRC for human thermal comfort in buildings.

      <title>Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Tellurium Batteries with Ultraflat Discharge Plateau and High Volumetric Capacity</title>
      <dc:description>
A new conversion&#8208;type zinc&#8208;ion battery is developed, in which the chalcogen element tellurium serves as the cathode in aqueous electrolytes. Based on the two&#8208;step solid&#8208;to&#8208;solid conversion mechanism with the successive formation of zinc ditelluride and zinc telluride, this battery avoids the shuttle effect and exhibits an ultraflat discharge plateau, high volumetric capacity, as well as long cycling life.








Abstract
Traditional aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) based on ion&#8208;intercalation or surface redox behaviors at the cathode side suffer severely from an unsatisfactory specific capacity and unstable output potential. Herein, these issues are applied to a conversion&#8208;type zinc&#8211;tellurium (Zn&#8211;Te) battery. Typically, this battery works based on a two&#8208;step solid&#8208;to&#8208;solid conversion with the successive formation of zinc ditelluride (ZnTe2) and zinc telluride (ZnTe). It delivers an ultrahigh volumetric capacity of 2619 mAh cm&#8722;3 (419 mAh g&#8722;1), 74.1% of which is from the first conversion (Te to ZnTe2) with an ultraflat discharge plateau. Though reported first in a challenging aqueous environment, this Zn&#8211;Te battery demonstrates an excellent capacity retention of &gt;82.8% after 500 cycles, which results from the elimination of the notorious &#8220;shuttle effect&#8221; due to the solid&#8208;to&#8208;solid conversion behaviors. In addition, a quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Zn&#8211;Te battery is also fabricated, exhibiting superior flexibility, robustness, and good electrochemical performance. This work develops a novel cathode material based on conversion&#8208;type ion&#8208;storage mechanism. The system is attractive due to its ultrastable energy output, which is rarely reported for ZIBs.

      <title>Facile Proton Transport in Ammonium Borosulfate&#8212;An Unhumidified Solid Acid Polyelectrolyte for Intermediate Temperatures</title>
      <dc:description>
Ammonium borosulfate, a novel solid acid electrolyte, exhibits ionic conductivities of 0.1&#8211;10&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 from 25&#8211;180&#160;&#176;C in the absence of humidification, making it a viable candidate electrolyte for intermediate&#8208;temperature fuel cells designed to operate at 150&#8211;300&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
High proton conductivity is reported for unhumidified ammonium borosulfate, NH4[B(SO4)2], a solid acid coordination polymer that contains 1D, hydrogen&#8208;bonded NH4+&#183;&#183;&#183;1&#8734;[B(SO4)4/2]&#8722; chains. NH4[B(SO4)2] is thermally stable to 320&#160;&#176;C and is amenable to sintering into monolithic, polycrystalline discs at 200&#160;&#176;C and about 300&#160;MPa of uniaxial pressure. Impedance spectroscopy measurements reveal ionic conductivities for sintered ammonium borosulfate of 0.1&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#160;&#176;C and up to 10&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 at 180&#160;&#176;C in ambient air. No superprotonic transition is observed in the temperature range of 25&#8211;180&#160;&#176;C. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations show these high conductivities are aided by free rotation of the NH4+ units and significant gyrational mobility of the SO4 tetrahedra, which, in turn, provide facile pathways for proton locomotion. High conductivities, a wide operational temperature window, and tolerance to both ambient and anhydrous conditions make NH4[B(SO4)]2 an attractive candidate electrolyte for intermediate&#8208;temperature hydrogen fuel cells that may enable operation at temperatures as high as 300&#160;&#176;C without active humidification.

      <title>High Thermoelectric Performance in n&#8208;Type Perylene Bisimide Induced by the Soret Effect</title>
      <dc:description>
An organic mixed ion&#8211;electron n&#8208;type conductor based on highly crystalline and reduced perylene bisimide is developed, achieving a record ZT value of 0.23 that enables a quasi&#8208;constant thermoelectric power output. This work paves the way for the design and development of efficient organic thermoelectrics by rational control of the mobility of the electronic and ionic carriers.








Abstract
Low&#8208;cost, non&#8208;toxic, abundant organic thermoelectric materials are currently under investigation for use as potential alternatives for the production of electricity from waste heat. While organic conductors reach electrical conductivities as high as their inorganic counterparts, they suffer from an overall low thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) due to their small Seebeck coefficient. Moreover, the lack of efficient n&#8208;type organic materials still represents a major challenge when trying to fabricate efficient organic thermoelectric modules. Here, a novel strategy is proposed both to increase the Seebeck coefficient and achieve the highest thermoelectric efficiency for n&#8208;type organic thermoelectrics to date. An organic mixed ion&#8211;electron n&#8208;type conductor based on highly crystalline and reduced perylene bisimide is developed. Quasi&#8208;frozen ionic carriers yield a large ionic Seebeck coefficient of &#8722;3021 &#181;V K&#8722;1, while the electronic carriers dominate the electrical conductivity which is as high as 0.18 S cm&#8722;1 at 60% relative humidity. The overall power factor is remarkably high (165 &#181;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2), with a ZT = 0.23 at room temperature. The resulting single leg thermoelectric generators display a high quasi&#8208;constant power output. This work paves the way for the design and development of efficient organic thermoelectrics by the rational control of the mobility of the electronic and ionic carriers.

      <title>An Antioxidant Enzyme Therapeutic for COVID&#8208;19</title>
      <dc:description>
A catalase&#8208;based therapeutic is developed for COVID&#8208;19, which eliminates excessively produced reactive oxygen species, prevents oxidative injury, regulates production of cytokines, and represses replication of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 in ex vivo cell studies and rhesus macaques, providing a low&#8208;cost yet effective therapeutic for the pandemic and hyperinflammation in general.








Abstract
The COVID&#8208;19 pandemic has taken a significant toll on people worldwide, and there are currently no specific antivirus drugs or vaccines. Herein it is a therapeutic based on catalase, an antioxidant enzyme that can effectively breakdown hydrogen peroxide and minimize the downstream reactive oxygen species, which are excessively produced resulting from the infection and inflammatory process, is reported. Catalase assists to regulate production of cytokines, protect oxidative injury, and repress replication of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, as demonstrated in human leukocytes and alveolar epithelial cells, and rhesus macaques, without noticeable toxicity. Such a therapeutic can be readily manufactured at low cost as a potential treatment for COVID&#8208;19.

      <title>GSH&#8208;Depleted Nanozymes with Hyperthermia&#8208;Enhanced Dual Enzyme&#8208;Mimic Activities for Tumor Nanocatalytic Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>
Superior tumor inhibition effects of the bacteria&#8208;like nanozyme based on the hyperthermia&#8208;enhanced dual enzyme&#8208;mimic activities and glutathione depletion are reported.








Abstract
Nanocatalytic therapy, using artificial nanoscale enzyme mimics (nanozymes), is an emerging technology for therapeutic treatment of various malignant tumors. However, the relatively deficient catalytic activity of nanozymes in the tumor microenvironment (TME) restrains their biomedical applications. Here, a versatile and bacteria&#8208;like PEG/Ce&#8208;Bi@DMSN nanozyme is developed by coating uniform Bi2S3 nanorods (NRs) with dendritic mesoporous silica (Bi2S3@DMSN) and then decorating ultrasmall ceria nanozymes into the large mesopores of Bi2S3@DMSN. The nanozymes exhibit dual enzyme&#8208;mimic catalytic activities (peroxidase&#8208;mimic and catalase&#8208;mimic) under acidic conditions that can regulate the TME, that is, simultaneously elevate oxidative stress and relieve hypoxia. In addition, the nanozymes can effectively consume the overexpressed glutathione (GSH) through redox reaction. Photothermal therapy (PTT) is introduced to synergistically improve the dual enzyme&#8208;mimicking catalytic activities and depletion of the overexpressed GSH in the tumors by photonic hyperthermia. This is achieved by taking advantage of the desirable light absorbance in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window of the PEG/Ce&#8208;Bi@DMSN nanozymes. Subsequently the reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;mediated therapeutic efficiency is significantly improved. Therefore, this study provides a proof of concept of hyperthermia&#8208;augmented multi&#8208;enzymatic activities of nanozymes for tumor ablation.

&lt;p&gt;Superior tumor inhibition effects of the bacteria&#8208;like nanozyme based on the hyperthermia&#8208;enhanced dual enzyme&#8208;mimic activities and glutathione depletion are reported.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nanocatalytic therapy, using artificial nanoscale enzyme mimics (nanozymes), is an emerging technology for therapeutic treatment of various malignant tumors. However, the relatively deficient catalytic activity of nanozymes in the tumor microenvironment (TME) restrains their biomedical applications. Here, a versatile and bacteria&#8208;like PEG/Ce&#8208;Bi@DMSN nanozyme is developed by coating uniform Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanorods (NRs) with dendritic mesoporous silica (Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;@DMSN) and then decorating ultrasmall ceria nanozymes into the large mesopores of Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;@DMSN. The nanozymes exhibit dual enzyme&#8208;mimic catalytic activities (peroxidase&#8208;mimic and catalase&#8208;mimic) under acidic conditions that can regulate the TME, that is, simultaneously elevate oxidative stress and relieve hypoxia. In addition, the nanozymes can effectively consume the overexpressed glutathione (GSH) through redox reaction. Photothermal therapy (PTT) is introduced to synergistically improve the dual enzyme&#8208;mimicking catalytic activities and depletion of the overexpressed GSH in the tumors by photonic hyperthermia. This is achieved by taking advantage of the desirable light absorbance in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window of the PEG/Ce&#8208;Bi@DMSN nanozymes. Subsequently the reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;mediated therapeutic efficiency is significantly improved. Therefore, this study provides a proof of concept of hyperthermia&#8208;augmented multi&#8208;enzymatic activities of nanozymes for tumor ablation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Recent Advances on Mixed Metal Sulfides for Advanced Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Mixed metal sulfides are considered as promising negative electrode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. This unique class of electrodes has some distinct advantages in boosting sodium storage properties. Some recent advances in the rational design and synthesis of mixed metal sulfides as anode materials for sodium storage are summarized.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) have drawn enormous attention in the past few years from both academic and industrial battery communities in view of the fascinating advantages of rich abundance and low cost of sodium resources. Among various electrode materials, mixed metal sulfides (MMSs) stand out as promising negative electrode materials for SIBs considering their superior structural and compositional advantages, such as decent electrochemical reversibility, high electronic conductivity, and rich redox reactions. Here, a summary of some recent developments in the rational design and synthesis of various kinds of MMSs with tailorable architectures, structural/compositional complexity, controllable morphologies, and enhanced electrochemical properties is presented. The effect of structural engineering and compositional design of MMSs on the sodium storage properties is highlighted. It is anticipated that further innovative works on the material design of advanced electrodes for batteries can be inspired.

      <title>Combating Implant Infections: Shifting Focus from Bacteria to Host</title>
      <dc:description>
Biomaterials are known to frustrate the immune system, rendering them more likely to be colonized by pathogens. The importance of host immunomodulation in the development of anti&#8208;infective biomaterials is described. Novel strategies in this field can help decrease the susceptibility to infection and the high reliance on antibiotic drugs.








Abstract
The widespread use of biomaterials to support or replace body parts is increasingly threatened by the risk of implant&#8208;associated infections. In the quest for finding novel anti&#8208;infective biomaterials, there generally has been a one&#8208;sided focus on biomaterials with direct antibacterial properties, which leads to excessive use of antibacterial agents, compromised host responses, and unpredictable effectiveness in vivo. This review sheds light on how host immunomodulation, rather than only targeting bacteria, can endow biomaterials with improved anti&#8208;infective properties. How antibacterial surface treatments are at risk to be undermined by biomaterial features that dysregulate the protection normally provided by critical immune cell subsets, namely, neutrophils and macrophages, is discussed. Accordingly, how the precise modification of biomaterial surface biophysical cues, or the incorporation of immunomodulatory drug delivery systems, can render biomaterials with the necessary immune&#8208;compatible and immune&#8208;protective properties to potentiate the host defense mechanisms is reviewed. Within this context, the protective role of host defense peptides, metallic particles, quorum sensing inhibitors, and therapeutic adjuvants is discussed. The highlighted immunomodulatory strategies may lay a foundation to develop anti&#8208;infective biomaterials, while mitigating the increasing threat of antibacterial drug resistance.

      <title>Multioperation&#8208;Mode Light&#8208;Emitting Field&#8208;Effect Transistors Based on van der Waals Heterostructure</title>
      <dc:description>
A light emitting transistor based on van der Waals heterostructure is demonstrated. Utilizing tunable graphene contacts, holes and electrons are separately injected into the ambipolar WSe2 monolayer. By balanced recombination of electrons and holes, the external quantum efficiency reaches &#8776;6% at room temperature. Multimode operation of this device powered by combination of electrical and optical states would be beneficial for optical circuitry.








Abstract
2D semiconductors have shown great potential for application to electrically tunable optoelectronics. Despite the strong excitonic photoluminescence (PL) of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), their efficient electroluminescence (EL) has not been achieved due to the low efficiency of charge injection and electron&#8211;hole recombination. Here, multioperation&#8208;mode light&#8208;emitting field&#8208;effect transistors (LEFETs) consisting of a monolayer WSe2 channel and graphene contacts coupled with two top gates for selective and balanced injection of charge carriers are demonstrated. Visibly observable EL is achieved with the high external quantum efficiency of &#8776;6% at room temperature due to efficient recombination of injected electrons and holes in a confined 2D channel. Further, electrical tunability of both the channel and contacts enables multioperation modes, such as antiambipolar, depletion,and unipolar regions, which can be utilized for polarity&#8208;tunable field&#8208;effect transistors and photodetectors. The work exhibits great potential for use in 2D semiconductor LEFETs for novel optoelectronics capable of high efficiency, multifunctions, and heterointegration.

      <title>Past, Present, and Future of Soft&#8208;Tissue Prosthetics: Advanced Polymers and Advanced Manufacturing</title>
      <dc:description>
Soft tissue prosthetics reduce suffering for millions experiencing disfigurement due to cancers, congenital defects, or trauma. Advanced manufacturing and advanced synthetic materials promise significantly improved realism and function, replacing traditional materials and labor intensive fabrication. Both traditional synthetic polymers and advanced manufacturing and materials are discussed in the context of soft tissue prosthetics, including future technologies and their potential.








Abstract
Millions of people worldwide experience disfigurement due to cancers, congenital defects, or trauma, leading to significant psychological, social, and economic disadvantage. Prosthetics aim to reduce their suffering by restoring aesthetics and function using synthetic materials that mimic the characteristics of native tissue. In the 1900s, natural materials used for thousands of years in prosthetics were replaced by synthetic polymers bringing about significant improvements in fabrication and greater realism and utility. These traditional methods have now been disrupted by the advanced manufacturing revolution, radically changing the materials, methods, and nature of prosthetics. In this report, traditional synthetic polymers and advanced prosthetic materials and manufacturing techniques are discussed, including a focus on prosthetic material degradation. New manufacturing approaches and future technological developments are also discussed in the context of specific tissues requiring aesthetic restoration, such as ear, nose, face, eye, breast, and hand. As advanced manufacturing moves from research into clinical practice, prosthetics can begin new age to significantly improve the quality of life for those suffering tissue loss or disfigurement.

      <title>Intercalation Pseudocapacitive Zn2+ Storage with Hydrated Vanadium Dioxide toward Ultrahigh Rate Performance</title>
      <dc:description>
A structural design method is presented wherein lattice defects and crystal water are introduced into vanadium dioxide. The high&#8208;rate electrochemical behavior stems from intercalation pseudocapacitance, promoting the surface&#8208;controlled capacitance feature. The suitable crystal structure makes the solid ion diffusion process no longer the rate&#8208;limiting step.








Abstract
The weak van der Waals interactions enable ion&#8208;intercalation&#8208;type hosts to be ideal pseudocapacitive materials for energy storage. Here, a methodology for the preparation of hydrated vanadium dioxide nanoribbon (HVO) with moderate transport pathways is proposed. Out of the ordinary, the intercalation pseudocapacitive reaction mechanism is discovered for HVO, which powers high&#8208;rate capacitive charge storage compared with the battery&#8208;type intercalation reaction.

     alt="Intercalation Pseudocapacitive Zn2+ Storage with Hydrated Vanadium Dioxide toward Ultrahigh Rate Performance"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A structural design method is presented wherein lattice defects and crystal water are introduced into vanadium dioxide. The high&#8208;rate electrochemical behavior stems from intercalation pseudocapacitance, promoting the surface&#8208;controlled capacitance feature. The suitable crystal structure makes the solid ion diffusion process no longer the rate&#8208;limiting step.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weak van der Waals interactions enable ion&#8208;intercalation&#8208;type hosts to be ideal pseudocapacitive materials for energy storage. Here, a methodology for the preparation of hydrated vanadium dioxide nanoribbon (HVO) with moderate transport pathways is proposed. Out of the ordinary, the intercalation pseudocapacitive reaction mechanism is discovered for HVO, which powers high&#8208;rate capacitive charge storage compared with the battery&#8208;type intercalation reaction. The main factor is that the defective crystalline structure provides suitable ambient spacing for rapidly accommodating and transporting cations. As a result, the HVO delivers a fast Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion diffusion coefficient and a low Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion barrier. The electrochemical results with intercalation pseudocapacitance demonstrate a high reversible capacity of 396 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.05 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and even maintain 88 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at a high current density of 50 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Based on Group 3 and 4 Metals</title>
      <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) based on group 3 and 4 metals with high chemical stability, structural diversity, and various interesting properties are reviewed. Cluster and framework chemistry of group 3 and 4 metals are expected to provide a timely summary on MOF development, which shall guide the discovery and development of stable and functional MOFs for practical applications.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) based on group 3 and 4 metals are considered as the most promising MOFs for varying practical applications including water adsorption, carbon conversion, and biomedical applications. The relatively strong coordination bonds and versatile coordination modes within these MOFs endow the framework with high chemical stability, diverse structures and topologies, and interesting properties and functions. Herein, the significant progress made on this series of MOFs since 2018 is summarized and an update on the current status and future trends on the structural design of robust MOFs with high connectivity is provided. Cluster chemistry involving Y, lanthanides (Ln, from La to Lu), actinides (An, from Ac to Lr), Ti, and Zr is initially introduced. This is followed by a review of recently developed MOFs based on group 3 and 4 metals with their structures discussed based on the types of inorganic or organic building blocks. The novel properties and arising applications of these MOFs in catalysis, adsorption and separation, delivery, and sensing are highlighted. Overall, this review is expected to provide a timely summary on MOFs based on group 3 and 4 metals, which shall guide the future discovery and development of stable and functional MOFs for practical applications.

      <title>Fluorescent Diagnostic Probes in Neurodegenerative Diseases</title>
      <dc:description>
Recent progress in fluorescent diagnostic probes for detecting the biomarkers associated with neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, spinal cord injury, and prion diseases is reviewed. Guides to develop new sensing strategies and recognition mechanisms, and the ideal features to further improve neurodegenerative disease fluorescence imaging, are also explored.








Abstract
Neurodegenerative diseases are debilitating disorders that feature progressive and selective loss of function or structure of anatomically or physiologically associated neuronal systems. Both chronic and acute neurodegenerative diseases are associated with high morbidity and mortality along with the death of neurons in different areas of the brain; moreover, there are few or no effective curative therapy options for treating these disorders. There is an urgent need to diagnose neurodegenerative disease as early as possible, and to distinguish between different disorders with overlapping symptoms that will help to decide the best clinical treatment. Recently, in neurodegenerative disease research, fluorescent&#8208;probe&#8208;mediated biomarker visualization techniques have been gaining increasing attention for the early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases. A survey of fluorescent probes for sensing and imaging biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases is provided. These imaging probes are categorized based on the different potential biomarkers of various neurodegenerative diseases, and their advantages and disadvantages are discussed. Guides to develop new sensing strategies, recognition mechanisms, as well as the ideal features to further improve neurodegenerative disease fluorescence imaging are also explored.

      <title>A Continuously Tunable Solid&#8208;Like Convective Thermal Metadevice on the Reciprocal Line</title>
      <dc:description>
A solid&#8208;like convective thermal metadevice is proposed. It can disguise any target as a solid material with a continuously tunable thermal conductivity in a wide range. This is achieved by restoring the reciprocity of a convective system on the reciprocal line, based on its effective thermal conductivity.








Abstract
The emerging thermal metamaterials and metadevices demonstrate significant potential to transform thermal conduction. However, the thermal conductivities of existing devices are all restricted at fixed values if the configuration or constituent materials are static. Thermal convection provides an additional tool to boost and flexibly modify the heat transfer in moving matter, but it is essentially distinct from thermal conduction since the Onsager reciprocity is generally broken in the former but preserved in the latter. Therefore, it is difficult to use convective components for sophisticated control of conductive heat. Here, it is shown that a convective system can be made undistinguishable from a conductive one in principle, by discovering and operating on the reciprocal line of mechanically rotating systems. The realized thermal metadevice can thus mimic a solid&#8208;like material whose thermal conductivity dynamically covers a wide range. It offers great possibilities of real&#8208;time smooth control over heat transfer for broad applications.

      <title>Recent Advances of Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy for Microporous Materials</title>
      <dc:description>
Recent progress in the application of solid&#8208;state NMR in the study of microporous materials is reviewed. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopies for characterization of the structures and dynamics of microporous materials are summarized. The obtained atomic&#8208;level information that allows understanding of the structure&#8211;performance relationships is highlighted.








Abstract
Microporous materials have attracted a rapid growth of research interest in materials science and the multidisciplinary area because of their wide applications in catalysis, separation, ion exchange, gas storage, drug release, and sensing. A fundamental understanding of their diverse structures and properties is crucial for rational design of high&#8208;performance materials and technological applications in industry. Solid&#8208;state NMR (SSNMR), capable of providing atomic&#8208;level information on both structure and dynamics, is a powerful tool in the scientific exploration of solid materials. Here, advanced SSNMR instruments and methods for characterization of microporous materials are briefly described. The recent progress of the application of SSNMR for the investigation of microporous materials including zeolites, metal&#8211;organic frameworks, covalent organic frameworks, porous aromatic frameworks, and layered materials is discussed with representative work. The versatile SSNMR techniques provide detailed information on the local structure, dynamics, and chemical processes in the confined space of porous materials. The challenges and prospects in SSNMR study of microporous and related materials are discussed.

      <title>3D Printing: 3D Printing of Microgel&#8208;Loaded Modular Microcages as Instructive Scaffolds for Tissue Engineering (Adv. Mater. 36/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article number 2001736, Luiz E. Bertassoni and co&#8208;workers present the use of lithography&#8208;based 3D printing to fabricate a novel modular microcage scaffold system. These hollow microcages can be stacked in thousands of geometric configurations with the ability to scale in size and shape to fit complex tissue defects. Different growth factors and cells can be placed inside each block, enabling cell&#8208;instructive and accelerated repair of musculoskeletal tissue injuries.

      <dc:description>
A sky&#8208;blue&#8208;exciplex&#8208;forming host constructed by &#960;&#8211;donor and &#960;&#8211;acceptor with bipolar &#960;&#8208;spacers is used to fabricate single&#8208;emissive&#8208;layer all&#8208;fluorescent white organic light&#8208;emitting diodes, leading to stable warm white emission with a record&#8208;high power efficiency of 69.6 lm W&#8722;1 and a long T80 (time to 80% of the initial luminance) of &gt;8200 h at 1000 cd m&#8722;2.








Abstract
Exciplex&#8208;forming hosts with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) provide a viable opportunity to unlock the full potential of the yet&#8208;to&#8208;be improved power efficiencies (PEs) and stabilities of all&#8208;fluorescent white organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (WOLEDs), but this, however, is hindered by the lack of stable blue exciplexes. Here, an advanced exciplex system is proposed by incorporating bipolar charge&#8208;transport &#960;&#8208;spacers into both the electron&#8208;donor (D) and the electron&#8208;accepter (A) to increase their distance for hypsochromic&#8208;shifted emission while maintaining the superior transporting ability. By using spirofluorene as the &#960;&#8208;spacer, 3,3&#8242;&#8208;bicarbazole as the D&#8208;unit, and 2,4,6&#8208;triphenyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine as the A&#8208;unit, a &#960;&#8211;D and &#960;&#8211;A exciplex with sky&#8208;blue emission and fast reverse intersystem crossing process is thereof constructed. Combining this exciplex&#8208;forming host, a blue TADF&#8208;sensitizer, and a yellow conventional fluorescent dopant in a single&#8208;emissive&#8208;layer, the fabricated warm&#8208;white&#8208;emissive device simultaneously exhibits a low driving voltage of 3.08 V, an external quantum efficiency of 21.4%, and a remarkable T80 (time to 80% of the initial luminance) of &gt;8200 h at 1000 cd m&#8722;2, accompanied by a new benchmark PE of 69.6 lm W&#8722;1 among all&#8208;fluorescent WOLEDs.

      <title>Recent Progress in Graphene/Polymer Nanocomposites</title>
      <dc:description>
Recent progress on graphene/polymer nanocomposites is reviewed with emphasis on strengthening and toughening, electrical conduction, thermal transportation, and photothermal conversion. The roles of graphene configuration, interfacial interaction, and distribution of graphene in the polymer to determine the properties of the nanocomposites are systematically explored. This may provide constructive guidance to develop high&#8208;performance nanocomposites in the future.








Abstract
Nanocomposites, multiphase solid materials with at least one nanoscaled component, have been attracting ever&#8208;increasing attention because of their unique properties. Graphene is an ideal filler for high&#8208;performance multifunctional nanocomposites in light of its superior mechanical, electrical, thermal, and optical properties. However, the 2D nature of graphene usually gives rise to highly anisotropic features, which brings new opportunities to tailor nanocomposites by making full use of its excellent in&#8208;plane properties. Here, recent progress on graphene/polymer nanocomposites is summarized with emphasis on strengthening/toughening, electrical conduction, thermal transportation, and photothermal energy conversion. The influence of the graphene configuration, including layer number, defects, and lateral size, on its intrinsic properties and the properties of graphene/polymer nanocomposites is systematically analyzed. Meanwhile, the role of the interfacial interaction between graphene and polymer in affecting the properties of nanocomposites is also explored. The correlation between the graphene distribution in the matrix and the properties of the nanocomposite is discussed in detail. The key challenges and possible solutions are also addressed. This review may provide a constructive guidance for preparing high&#8208;performance graphene/polymer nanocomposite in the future.

      <title>Effective Modulation of CNS Inhibitory Microenvironment using Bioinspired Hybrid&#8208;Nanoscaffold&#8208;Based Therapeutic Interventions</title>
      <dc:description>
Current biomaterials&#8208;based treatment of central nervous system (CNS) injuries has been hampered by the resulting neuroinhibitory microenvironment. By targeting two critical neuroinhibitory factors in a single platform, a biomimetic 3D porous hybrid nanoscaffold is created by developing viscous interfacial self&#8208;assembly. The nanoscaffold&#8208;based therapeutic interventions achieve functional recovery through reducing neuroinflammation and fibrotic scarring, thereby paving a new road for the biomaterials&#8208;based treatment of CNS injuries.








Abstract
Central nervous system (CNS) injuries are often debilitating, and most currently have no cure. This is due to the formation of a neuroinhibitory microenvironment at injury sites, which includes neuroinflammatory signaling and non&#8208;permissive extracellular matrix (ECM) components. To address this challenge, a viscous interfacial self&#8208;assembly approach, to generate a bioinspired hybrid 3D porous nanoscaffold platform for delivering anti&#8208;inflammatory molecules and establish a favorable 3D&#8208;ECM environment for the effective suppression of the neuroinhibitory microenvironment, is developed. By tailoring the structural and biochemical properties of the 3D porous nanoscaffold, enhanced axonal growth from the dual&#8208;targeting therapeutic strategy in a human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)&#8208;based in vitro model of neuroinflammation is demonstrated. Moreover, nanoscaffold&#8208;based approaches promote significant axonal growth and functional recovery in vivo in a spinal cord injury model through a unique mechanism of anti&#8208;inflammation&#8208;based fibrotic scar reduction. Given the critical role of neuroinflammation and ECM microenvironments in neuroinhibitory signaling, the developed nanobiomaterial&#8208;based therapeutic intervention may pave a new road for treating CNS injuries.

      <title>Nanometer&#8208;Scale Uniform Conductance Switching in Molecular Memristors</title>
      <dc:description>
A&#160;well&#8208;known&#160;problem of all the existing resistive&#8208;switching mechanisms is that they are inherently nonuniform and suffer from stochastic variability. This long&#8208;standing problem is resolved by demonstrating a 100% areally uniform current switching driven by molecular redox, characterized via concurrent conductive atomic force microscopy and tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy with &lt;7 nm resolution.








Abstract
One common challenge highlighted in almost every review article on organic resistive memory is the lack of areal switching uniformity. This, in fact, is a puzzle because a molecular switching mechanism should ideally be isotropic and produce homogeneous current switching free from electroforming. Such a demonstration, however, remains elusive to date. The reports attempting to characterize a nanoscopic picture of switching in molecular films show random current spikes, just opposite to the expectation. Here, this longstanding conundrum is resolved by demonstrating 100% spatially homogeneous current switching (driven by molecular redox) in memristors based on Ru&#8208;complexes of azo&#8208;aromatic ligands. Through a concurrent nanoscopic spatial mapping using conductive atomic force microscopy and in operando tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (both with resolution &lt;7 nm),&#160;it is shown that molecular switching in the films is uniform from hundreds of micrometers down to the nanoscale and that conductance value exactly correlates with spectroscopically determined molecular redox states. This provides a deterministic molecular route to obtain spatially homogeneous, forming&#8208;free switching that can conceivably overcome the chronic problems of robustness, consistency, reproducibility, and scalability in organic memristors.

      <title>Multifunctional Charge Transporting Materials for Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
      <dc:description>
Perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes attract much attention because of their advantages such as high color purity, easy and wide color tunability, and high photoluminescence quantum yields. The recent developments of ideal multifunctional charge transport layers are discussed by considering the fundamental limitations including defects, morphological and phase instability, high refractive index, and poor outcoupling of perovskites.








Abstract
Despite their low exciton&#8208;binding energies, metal halide perovskites are extensively studied as light&#8208;emitting materials owing to narrow emission with high color purity, easy/wide color tunability, and high photoluminescence quantum yields. To improve the efficiency of perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs), much effort has been devoted to controlling the emitting layer morphologies to induce charge confinement and decrease the nonradiative recombination. The interfaces between the emitting layer and charge transporting layer (CTL) are vulnerable to various defects that deteriorate the efficiency and stability of the PeLEDs. Therefore, the establishment of multifunctional CTLs that can improve not only charge transport but also critical factors that influence device performance, such as defect passivation, morphology/phase control, ion migration suppression, and light outcoupling efficiency, are highly required. Herein, the fundamental limitations of perovskites as emitters (i.e., defects, morphological and phase instability, high refractive index with poor outcoupling) and the recent developments with regard to multifunctional CTLs to compensate such limitations are summarized, and their device applications are also reviewed. Finally, based on the importance of multifunctional CTLs, the outlook and research prospects of multifunctional CTLs for the further improvement of PeLEDs are discussed.

     alt="Multifunctional Charge Transporting Materials for Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes attract much attention because of their advantages such as high color purity, easy and wide color tunability, and high photoluminescence quantum yields. The recent developments of ideal multifunctional charge transport layers are discussed by considering the fundamental limitations including defects, morphological and phase instability, high refractive index, and poor outcoupling of perovskites.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite their low exciton&#8208;binding energies, metal halide perovskites are extensively studied as light&#8208;emitting materials owing to narrow emission with high color purity, easy/wide color tunability, and high photoluminescence quantum yields. To improve the efficiency of perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs), much effort has been devoted to controlling the emitting layer morphologies to induce charge confinement and decrease the nonradiative recombination. The interfaces between the emitting layer and charge transporting layer (CTL) are vulnerable to various defects that deteriorate the efficiency and stability of the PeLEDs. Therefore, the establishment of multifunctional CTLs that can improve not only charge transport but also critical factors that influence device performance, such as defect passivation, morphology/phase control, ion migration suppression, and light outcoupling efficiency, are highly required. Herein, the fundamental limitations of perovskites as emitters (i.e., defects, morphological and phase instability, high refractive index with poor outcoupling) and the recent developments with regard to multifunctional CTLs to compensate such limitations are summarized, and their device applications are also reviewed. Finally, based on the importance of multifunctional CTLs, the outlook and research prospects of multifunctional CTLs for the further improvement of PeLEDs are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Nonmetal Current Collectors: The Key Component for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Aluminum Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
A novel nonmetal current collector for aluminum batteries is demonstrated to substantially promote the chemical and electrochemical stability in an acidic ionic&#8208;liquid electrolyte. The energy&#8208;storage performance is enhanced obviously in terms of decreasing the mass ratio of the materials in the positive electrode. The results offer a novel strategy for assembling highly stable electrodes to achieve high&#8208;performance aluminum batteries.








Abstract
As one of the emerging safe energy&#8208;storage devices with high energy&#8208;to&#8208;cost ratio, nonaqueous aluminum batteries with enhanced energy density are intensively pursued by researchers. Although significant progress has been made on positive electrode materials, the effective energy density of aluminum batteries is still limited by the presence of high&#8208;density refractory metal current collectors, which are known to be electrochemically inert in highly acidic ionic&#8208;liquid electrolytes. To address such critical issues, here, a novel low&#8208;density (&lt;2 g cm&#8722;3) nonmetal current collector is presented, which uses poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) substrates coated with indium tin oxide (ITO), with the purpose of significantly reducing the ratio of nonactive components in the electrodes. In addition to the excellent chemical and electrochemical stability (with voltage as high as &#8776;2.75 V vs Al3+/Al), this nonmetal current collector, also encompassing a carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) binder, allows as&#8208;assembled pouch cells to deliver a reversible specific capacity of &#8776;120 mAh g&#8722;1 at a current density of 50 mA g&#8722;1. In comparison with the high&#8208;density refractory metal Mo or Ta current collectors, these nonmetal current collectors offer a novel strategy for constructing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density aluminum batteries by substituting the key components, with the aim of boosting the energy density of nonaqueous aluminum batteries.

      <title>Gap States in Methylammonium Lead Halides: The Link to Dimethylsulfoxide?</title>
      <dc:description>
Minimization of gap states in halide perovskites is crucial for approaching theoretical device limit. This work correlates the appearance of gap states in methylammonium lead halides and the presence of dimethylsulfoxide in the processing solution. The results suggest the link between the products of the dimethylsulfoxide&#8211;methylammonium reaction and the gap states. Replacement with a non&#8208;reactive additive eliminates these gap states.








Abstract
Understanding the origin and distribution of electronic gap states in metal halide perovskite (MHP) thin films is crucial to the further improvement of the efficiency and long&#8208;term stability of MHP&#8208;based optoelectronic devices. In this work, the impact of Lewis&#8208;basic additives introduced in the precursor solution on the density of states in the perovskite bandgap is investigated. Ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy and contact potential difference measurements are conducted on MHP thin films processed from dimethylformamide (DMF)&#8208;based solutions to which either no additive, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), or N&#8208;methylpyrrolidine&#8208;2&#8208;thione (NMPT) is&#160;added. The results show the presence of a density of states in the gap of methylammonium lead halide films processed from DMSO&#8208;containing solution. The density of gap states is either suppressed when the methylammonium concentration in mixed cation films is reduced or when NMPT is used as an additive, and eliminated when methylammonium (MA) is replaced with cesium or formamidinium (FA). These results are consistent with the notion that reaction products that result from DMSO reacting with MA+ in the precursor solution are responsible for the formation of gap states.

      <title>Sensitive and Stable 2D Perovskite Single&#8208;Crystal X&#8208;ray Detectors Enabled by a Supramolecular Anchor</title>
      <dc:description>
F atoms in an organic spacer of a 2D perovskite enhance the supramolecular electrostatic interactions, serving as supramolecular anchors to stabilize single crystals. The corresponding optoelectronic properties are also improved. A fluorophenethylammonium lead iodide X&#8208;ray detector exhibits stable and sensitive response to 120 keVp X&#8208;rays; clear X&#8208;ray images with detection limit of 23 nGy s&#8722;1 are demonstrated.








Abstract
Perovskite X&#8208;ray detectors have been demonstrated to be sensitive to soft X&#8208;rays (&lt;80 keV) for potential medical imaging applications. However, developing X&#8208;ray detectors that are stable and sensitive to hard X&#8208;rays (80 to 120 keV) for practical medical imaging is highly desired. Here, a sensitive 2D fluorophenethylammonium lead iodide ((F&#8208;PEA)2PbI4) perovskite single&#8208;crystal hard&#8208;X&#8208;ray detector from low&#8208;cost solution processes is reported. Dipole interaction of organic ions promotes the ordering of benzene rings as well as the supramolecular electrostatic interaction between electron&#8208;deficient F atoms with neighbor benzene rings. Supramolecular interactions serve as a supramolecular anchor to stabilize and tune the electronic properties of single crystals. The 2D (F&#8208;PEA)2PbI4 perovskite single crystal exhibits an intrinsic property with record bulk resistivity of 1.36 &#215; 1012 &#937; cm, which brings a low device noise for hard X&#8208;ray detection. Meanwhile, the ion&#8208;migration phenomenon is effectively suppressed, even under the large applied bias of 200 V, by blocking the ion migration paths after anchoring. Consequently, the (F&#8208;PEA)2PbI4 single crystal detector yields a sensitivity of 3402 &#181;C Gy&#8722;1air cm&#8722;2 to 120 keVp hard X&#8208;rays with lowest detectable X&#8208;ray dose rate of 23 nGyair s&#8722;1, outperforming the dominating CsI scintillator of commercial digital radiography systems by acquiring clear X&#8208;ray images under much lower dose rate. In addition, the detector shows high operation stability under extremely high&#8208;flux X&#8208;ray irradiation.

Abstract
Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is a central metabolite that plays an indispensable role in various cellular processes, from energy supply to cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell signaling. Nature has developed sophisticated strategies to use the energy stored in ATP for many metabolic and non&#8208;equilibrium processes, and to sense and bind ATP for biological signaling. The variations in the ATP concentrations from one organelle to another, from extracellular to intracellular environments, and from normal cells to cancer cells are one motivation for designing ATP&#8208;triggered and ATP&#8208;fueled systems and materials, because they show great potential for applications in biological systems by using ATP as a trigger or chemical fuel. Over the last decade, ATP has been emerging as an attractive co&#8208;assembling component for man&#8208;made stimuli&#8208;responsive as well as for fuel&#8208;driven active systems and materials. Herein, current advances and emerging concepts for ATP&#8208;triggered and ATP&#8208;fueled self&#8208;assemblies and materials are discussed, shedding light on applications and highlighting future developments. By bringing together concepts of different domains, that is from supramolecular chemistry to DNA nanoscience, from equilibrium to non&#8208;equilibrium self&#8208;assembly, and from fundamental sciences to applications, the aim is to cross&#8208;fertilize current approaches with the ultimate aim to bring synthetic ATP&#8208;dependent systems closer to living systems.

      <title>Self&#8208;Densification of Highly Mesoporous Wood Structure into a Strong and Transparent Film</title>
      <dc:description>
TEMPO&#8208;mediated oxidation under neutral conditions using the TEMPO/NaClO/NaClO2 system is developed for delignified balsa wood. Individualization of cellulose microfibrils within the wood cell wall is achieved without mechanical disintegration. The resulting highly mesoporous oxidized wood structure can self&#8208;densify at ambient conditions to form a strong and transparent cellulose film, driven by the elastocapillary forces upon water evaporation.








Abstract
In the native wood cell wall, cellulose microfibrils are highly aligned and organized in the secondary cell wall. A new preparation strategy is developed to achieve individualization of cellulose microfibrils within the wood cell wall structure without introducing mechanical disintegration. The resulting mesoporous wood structure has a high specific surface area of 197 m2 g&#8722;1 when prepared by freeze&#8208;drying using liquid nitrogen, and 249 m2 g&#8722;1 by supercritical drying. These values are 5 to 7 times higher than conventional delignified wood (36 m2 g&#8722;1) dried by supercritical drying. Such highly mesoporous structure with individualized cellulose microfibrils maintaining their natural alignment and organization can be processed into aerogels with high porosity and high compressive strength. In addition, a strong film with a tensile strength of 449.1 &#177; 21.8 MPa and a Young's modulus of 51.1 &#177; 5.2 GPa along the fiber direction is obtained simply by air drying owing to the self&#8208;densification of cellulose microfibrils driven by the elastocapillary forces upon water evaporation. The self&#8208;densified film also shows high optical transmittance (80%) and high optical haze (70%) with interesting biaxial light scattering behavior owing to the natural alignment of cellulose microfibrils.

      <title>An &#8220;Ether&#8208;In&#8208;Water&#8221; Electrolyte Boosts Stable Interfacial Chemistry for Aqueous Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
A novel &#8220;ether&#8208;in&#8208;water&#8221; electrolyte is demonstrated by introducing the non&#8208;aqueous co&#8208;solvent TEGDME into an aqueous electrolyte. The designed Li4(TEGDME)(H2O)7 solvation sheath structure with stable interfacial chemistry dynamically expands the electrochemical stability window to 4.2 V. Meanwhile, the high&#8208;quality solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) and cathode&#8211;electrolyte interface (CEI) derived from the reduction of Li+2(TFSI&#8722;) and Li+4(TEGDME) effectively suppress hydrogen/oxygen evolution and electrode dissolution.








Abstract
Aqueous batteries are promising devices for electrochemical energy storage because of their high ionic conductivity, safety, low cost, and environmental friendliness. However, their voltage output and energy density are limited by the failure to form a solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) that can expand the inherently narrow electrochemical window of water (1.23 V) imposed by hydrogen and oxygen evolution. Here, a novel (Li4(TEGDME)(H2O)7) is proposed as a solvation electrolyte with stable interfacial chemistry. By introducing tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (TEGDME) into a concentrated aqueous electrolyte, a new carbonaceous component for both cathode&#8722;electrolyte interface and SEI formation is generated. In situ characterizations and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) calculations reveal a bilayer hybrid interface composed of inorganic LiF and organic carbonaceous species reduced from Li+2(TFSI&#8722;) and Li+4(TEGDME). Consequently, the interfacial films kinetically broaden the electrochemical stability window to 4.2 V, thus realizing a 2.5 V LiMn2O4&#8722;Li4Ti5O12 full battery with an excellent energy density of 120 W h kg&#8722;1 for 500 cycles. The results provide an in&#8208;depth, mechanistic understanding of a potential design of more effective interphases for next&#8208;generation aqueous lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

      <title>Observation and Ultrafast Dynamics of Inter&#8208;Sub&#8208;Band Transition in InAs Twinning Superlattice Nanowires</title>
      <dc:description>
The periodically spaced twin boundaries in semiconductors could introduce extraordinary miniband structure and lead to mid&#8208;infrared inter&#8208;sub&#8208;band transitions. Near&#8208;field infrared nano spectroscopy is employed to reveal this subtle but substantial mid&#8208;infrared transition in twin boundaries of well&#8208;engineered InAs twinning superlattice nanowires. Near&#8208;field pump&#8211;probe measurements demonstrate rich details of the mid&#8208;infrared transition dynamics.








Abstract
A variety of infrared applications rely on semiconductor superlattices, including, notably, the realization of high&#8208;power, compact quantum cascade lasers. Requirements for atomically smooth interface and limited lattice matching options set high technical standards for fabricating applicable heterostructure devices. The semiconductor twinning superlattice (TSL) forms in a single compound with periodically spaced twin boundaries and sharp interface junctions and can be grown with convenient synthesis methods. Therefore, employing semiconductor TSL may facilitate the development of optoelectronic applications related to superlattice structures. Here, it is shown that InAs TSL nanowires generate inter&#8208;sub&#8208;band transition channels due to the band projection and the Bragg&#8208;like electron reflection. The findings reveal the physical mechanisms of inter&#8208;sub&#8208;band transitions in TSL structure and suggest that TSL structures are promising candidates for mid&#8208;infrared optoelectronic applications.

      <title>Confined Fe&#8211;Cu Clusters as Sub&#8208;Nanometer Reactors for Efficiently Regulating the Electrochemical Nitrogen Reduction Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>
The utilization of regular surface cavities with unique microenvironment on graphitic carbon nitride as &#8220;subnano reactors&#8221; can precisely confine multiple Fe and Cu atoms for nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) electrocatalysis. The synergy of Fe and Cu atoms in such confined subnano space provides significantly enhanced NRR performance, in terms of much increased ammonia yield and faradic efficiency.








Abstract
Electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) over nonprecious&#8208;metal and single&#8208;atom catalysts has received increasing attention as a sustainable strategy to synthesize ammonia. However, the atomic&#8208;scale regulation of such active sites for NRR catalysis remains challenging because of the large distance between them, which significantly weakens their cooperation. Herein, the utilization of regular surface cavities with unique microenvironment on graphitic carbon nitride as &#8220;subnano reactors&#8221; to precisely confine multiple Fe and Cu atoms for NRR electrocatalysis is reported. The synergy of Fe and Cu atoms in such confined subnano space provides significantly enhanced NRR performance, with nearly doubles ammonia yield and 54%&#8208;increased Faradic efficiency up to 34%, comparing with the single&#8208;metal counterparts. First principle simulation reveals this synergistic effect originates from the unique Fe&#8211;Cu coordination, which effectively modifies the N2 absorption, improves electron transfer, and offers extra redox couples for NRR. This work thus provides new strategies of manipulating catalysts active centers at the sub&#8208;nanometer scale.

      <title>Supramolecular Chiral Aggregates Exhibiting Nonlinear CD&#8211;ee Dependence</title>
      <dc:description>
The research progress of nonlinear CD&#8211;ee dependence in the dynamic supramolecular aggregates, positive and negative, are summarized from the viewpoint of their discoveries, experimental observations, theoretical descriptions, and applications, in a hope to facilitate a better understanding of supramolecular chirality and the fabrication of functional supramolecular chiral materials.








Abstract
Although a linear relationship between the optical activity (normally the CD signal) and the enantiomeric excess (ee) of chiral auxiliaries has been the most commonly observed dependence in dynamic supramolecular helical aggregates, positive nonlinear CD&#8211;ee dependence, known as the &#8220;majority&#8208;rules effect&#8221; (MRE), indicative of chiral amplification, has also been well documented and to some extent understood. In sharp contrast, the negative nonlinear CD&#8211;ee dependence has been much less reported and is not well understood. Here, the state of the art of both the positive and negative nonlinear CD&#8211;ee dependence in noncovalently bound supramolecular helical aggregates is summarized, with the hope that the vast examples of supramolecular aggregates showing positive nonlinear dependence, in terms of the methods of investigations, variations in the structure of the building block (single species or multiple species), and theoretical modeling using the mismatch penalty energy and helix reversal penalty energy, would help to guide the design of building blocks to form aggregates showing negative nonlinear dependence, and thus to understand the mechanisms. The potential applications of those functional supramolecular aggregates are also discussed.

      <title>Reconstruction&#8208;Determined Alkaline Water Electrolysis at Industrial Temperatures</title>
      <dc:description>
Complete reconstruction of molybdate oxygen&#8208;evolving pre&#8208;catalysts and its fundamental understanding at industrial temperatures of 50&#8211;80 &#176;C are uncovered. In situ low&#8208;/high&#8208;temperature Raman and electron tomography identify the reconstruction mechanism, real active species, and stereoscopic structural characteristics. The boundary&#8211;vacancy co&#8208;effect enables the fast catalytic kinetics. The coupled cat.&#8208;51.9 and MoO2&#8208;Ni hydrogen&#8208;evolving arrays provide stable electrolysis operation (220 h) at 51.9 &#176;C.








Abstract
Evaluating the alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) at 50&#8211;80 &#176;C required in industry can veritably promote practical applications. Here, the thermally induced complete reconstruction (TICR) of molybdate oxygen evolution reaction (OER) pre&#8208;catalysts at 51.9 &#176;C and its fundamental mechanism are uncovered. The dynamic reconstruction processes, the real active species, and stereoscopic structural characteristics are identified by in situ low&#8208;/high&#8208;temperature Raman, ex situ microscopy, and electron tomography. The completely reconstructed (CR) catalyst (denoted as cat.&#8208;51.9) is interconnected by thermodynamically stable (oxy)hydroxide nanoparticles, with abundant boundaries and low crystallinity. For alkaline OER, cat.&#8208;51.9 exhibits a low overpotential (282.3 mV at 20 mA cm&#8722;2, 25.0 &#176;C) and ultrastable catalysis at 51.9 &#176;C (250 h, with a negligible activity decay of 19.6 &#181;V h&#8722;1). The experimental observations combined with theoretical analyses confirm the fast catalytic kinetics enabled by the co&#8208;effect of boundaries and vacancies. The coupled cat.&#8208;51.9 and MoO2&#8208;Ni hydrogen&#8208;evolving arrays provide stable electrolysis operation at 51.9 &#176;C for 220 h. This work uncovers new reconstruction phenomenon of pre&#8208;catalysts under realistic conditions and exceptional durability of CR catalysts toward practical high&#8208;temperature AWE.

Highly flexible and robust low&#8208;temperature solution&#8208;processed amorphous indium&#8211;gallium&#8211;zinc&#8211;oxide thin&#8208;film transistors and their integrated seven&#8208;stage ring oscillators are realized by using a stress&#8208;diffusive mesa&#8208;structured substrate.

Abstract
The increasing interest in flexible and wearable electronics has demanded a dramatic improvement of mechanical robustness in electronic devices along with high&#8208;resolution implemented architectures. In this study, a site&#8208;specific stress&#8208;diffusive manipulation is demonstrated to fulfill highly robust and ultraflexible amorphous indium&#8211;gallium&#8211;zinc oxide (a&#8208;IGZO) thin&#8208;film transistors (TFTs) and integrated circuits. The photochemically activated combustion sol&#8211;gel a&#8208;IGZO TFTs on a mesa&#8208;structured polyimide show an average saturation mobility of 6.06 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and a threshold voltage of &#8722;0.99 V with less than 9% variation, followed by 10 000 bending cycles with a radius of 125 &#956;m. More importantly, the site&#8208;specific monolithic formation of mesa pillar&#8208;structured devices can provide fully integrated logic circuits such as seven&#8208;stage ring&#8208;oscillators, meeting the industrially needed device density and scalability. To exploit the underlying stress&#8208;diffusive mechanism, a physical model is provided by using a variety of chemical, structural, and electrical characterizations along with multidomain finite&#8208;element analysis simulation. The physical models reveal that a highly scalable and robust device can be achieved via the site&#8208;specific mesa architecture, by enabling generation of multineutral layers and fine&#8208;tuning the accumulated stresses on specific element of devices with their diffusion out into the boundary of the mesa regions.

      <title>Reduced Graphene Oxide&#8208;Encapsulated Microfiber Patterns Enable Controllable Formation of Neuronal&#8208;Like Networks</title>
      <dc:description>
Conductive microfiber scaffolds are fabricated by combining near&#8208;field electrostatic printing (NFEP) and layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (L&#8208;b&#8208;L) assembly technologies. In situ reduction of graphene oxide L&#8208;b&#8208;L coated on NFEP microfibers yields conductive scaffolds with superior conductivity (&#8776;0.95 S cm&#8211;1) and the ability to guide neuronal&#8208;like network formation under electrical stimulation.








Abstract
Scaffold&#8208;guided formation of neuronal&#8208;like networks, especially under electrical stimulation, can be an appealing avenue toward functional restoration of injured nervous systems. Here, 3D conductive scaffolds are fabricated based on printed microfiber constructs using near&#8208;field electrostatic printing (NFEP) and graphene oxide (GO) coating. Various microfiber patterns are obtained from poly(l&#8208;lactic acid&#8208;co&#8208;caprolactone) (PLCL) using NFEP and complexity is achieved via modulating the fiber overlay angles (45&#176;, 60&#176;, 75&#176;, 90&#176;), fiber diameters (15 to 148&#160;&#181;m), and fiber spatial organization (spider web and tubular structure). Upon coating GO onto PLCL microfibers via a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (L&#8208;b&#8208;L) assembly technique and in situ reduction into reduced GO (rGO), the obtained conductive scaffolds, with 25&#8211;50 layers of rGO, demonstrate superior conductivity (&#8776;0.95 S cm&#8722;1) and capability of inducing neuronal&#8208;like network formation along the conductive microfibers under electrical stimulation (100&#8211;150&#160;mV cm&#8722;1). Both electric field (0&#8211;150&#160;mV cm&#8722;1) and microfiber diameter (17&#8211;150&#160;&#181;m) affect neurite outgrowth (PC&#8208;12 cells and primary mouse hippocampal neurons) and the formation of orientated neuronal&#8208;like networks. With further demonstration of such guidance to neuronal cells, these conductive scaffolds may see versatile applications in nerve regeneration and neural engineering.

      <title>Leveraging mRNA Sequences and Nanoparticles to Deliver SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Antigens In Vivo</title>
      <dc:description>
In the fight against the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 pandemic, mRNA is a promising vaccine candidate. Untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs are systematically engineered and optimized to enhance protein production. Through the use of lipid&#8208;derived nanoparticles, the mRNA vaccines, which are equipped with the optimized UTRs, trigger a dramatic expression of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 antigens and induce potent production of antigen&#8208;specific antibodies in vaccinated mice.








Abstract
SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 has become a pandemic worldwide; therefore, an effective vaccine is urgently needed. Recently, messenger RNAs (mRNAs) have emerged as a promising platform for vaccination. In this work, the untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs are systematically engineered in order to enhance protein production. Through a comprehensive analysis of endogenous gene expression and de novo design of UTRs, the optimal combination of 5&#8242; and 3&#8242; UTR are identified and termed NASAR, which are 5&#8208; to 10&#8208;fold more efficient than the tested endogenous UTRs. More importantly, NASAR mRNAs delivered by lipid&#8208;derived TT3 nanoparticles trigger a dramatic expression of potential SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 antigens. The antigen&#8208;specific antibodies induced by TT3&#8208;nanoparticles and NASAR mRNAs are over two orders of magnitude more than that induced by the FDA&#8208;approved lipid nanoparticle material MC3 in vaccinated mice. These NASAR mRNAs merit further development as alternative SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 vaccines.

      <title>Blocking Ion Migration Stabilizes the High Thermoelectric Performance in Cu2Se Composites</title>
      <dc:description>
The space&#8208;charge region between the Cu2Se host matrix and in&#8208;situ&#8208;formed BiCuSeO under a direct current causes drastic suppression of Cu+ ion migration in the composites and obstructs the reduction reaction of Cu+ into Cu metal, which, together with the effective regulation of carrier concentration as well as enhanced interfacial phonon scattering, greatly stabilizes the improved thermoelectric performance.








Abstract
The applications of mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductors are limited due to phase instability under a high direct current and large temperature difference. Here, it is shown that Cu2Se is stabilized through regulating the behaviors of Cu+ ions and electrons in a Schottky heterojunction between the Cu2Se host matrix and in&#8208;situ&#8208;formed BiCuSeO nanoparticles. The accumulation of Cu+ ions via an ionic capacitive effect at the Schottky junction under the direct current modifies the space&#8208;charge distribution in the electric double layer, which blocks the long&#8208;range migration of Cu+ and produces a drastic reduction of Cu+ ion migration by nearly two orders of magnitude. Moreover, this heterojunction impedes electrons transferring from BiCuSeO to Cu2Se, obstructing the reduction reaction of Cu+ into Cu metal at the interface and hence stabilizes the &#946;&#8208;Cu2Se phase. Furthermore, incorporation of BiCuSeO in Cu2Se optimizes the carrier concentration and intensifies phonon scattering, contributing to the peak figure of merit ZT value of &#8776;2.7&#160;at 973 K and high average ZT value of &#8776;1.5 between 400 and 973 K for the Cu2Se/BiCuSeO composites. This discovery provides a new avenue for stabilizing mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conduction thermoelectrics, and gives fresh insights into controlling ion migration in these ionic&#8208;transport&#8208;dominated materials.

     alt="Blocking Ion Migration Stabilizes the High Thermoelectric Performance in Cu2Se Composites"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The space&#8208;charge region between the Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se host matrix and in&#8208;situ&#8208;formed BiCuSeO under a direct current causes drastic suppression of Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion migration in the composites and obstructs the reduction reaction of Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; into Cu metal, which, together with the effective regulation of carrier concentration as well as enhanced interfacial phonon scattering, greatly stabilizes the improved thermoelectric performance.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The applications of mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductors are limited due to phase instability under a high direct current and large temperature difference. Here, it is shown that Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se is stabilized through regulating the behaviors of Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions and electrons in a Schottky heterojunction between the Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se host matrix and in&#8208;situ&#8208;formed BiCuSeO nanoparticles. The accumulation of Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions via an ionic capacitive effect at the Schottky junction under the direct current modifies the space&#8208;charge distribution in the electric double layer, which blocks the long&#8208;range migration of Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and produces a drastic reduction of Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion migration by nearly two orders of magnitude. Moreover, this heterojunction impedes electrons transferring from BiCuSeO to Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se, obstructing the reduction reaction of Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; into Cu metal at the interface and hence stabilizes the &#946;&#8208;Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se phase. Furthermore, incorporation of BiCuSeO in Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se optimizes the carrier concentration and intensifies phonon scattering, contributing to the peak figure of merit &lt;i&gt;ZT&lt;/i&gt; value of &lt;b&gt;&#8776;&lt;/b&gt;2.7&#160;at 973 K and high average &lt;i&gt;ZT&lt;/i&gt; value of &lt;b&gt;&#8776;&lt;/b&gt;1.5 between 400 and 973 K for the Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se/BiCuSeO composites. This discovery provides a new avenue for stabilizing mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conduction thermoelectrics, and gives fresh insights into controlling ion migration in these ionic&#8208;transport&#8208;dominated materials.&lt;/p&gt;

      <dc:description>
A series of nitrogen&#8208;doped, cross&#8208;coupled micro&#8208;mesoporous carbon&#8211;metal networks are developed as robust additives to 3D printing inks for the fabrication of micro&#8208;supercapacitors (MSCs).

Abstract
The construction of advanced micro&#8208;supercapacitors (MSCs) with both wide working&#8208;voltage and high energy density is promising but still challenging. In this work, a series of nitrogen&#8208;doped, cross&#8208;coupled micro&#8208;mesoporous carbon&#8211;metal networks (N&#8208;STC/MxOy) is developed as robust additives to 3D printing inks for MSCs fabrication. Taking the N&#8208;STC/Fe2O3 nanocomposite as an example, both experimental results and theoretical simulations reveal that the well&#8208;developed hierarchical networks with abundantly decorated ultrafine Fe2O3 nanoparticles not only significantly facilitate the ion adsorption at its three&#8208;phase boundaries (Fe2O3, N&#8208;STC, and electrolyte), but also greatly favor ionic diffusion/transport with shortened pathways. Consequently, the as&#8208;prepared N&#8208;STC/Fe2O3 electrode delivers a high gravimetric capacitance (267 F g&#8722;1 at 2 mV s&#8722;1) and outstanding stability in a liquid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;based symmetric device, as well as a record&#8208;high energy density of 114 Wh kg&#8722;1 for an asymmetric supercapacitor. Particularly, the gravimetric capacitance of the ionogel&#8208;based quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state MSCs by 3D printing reaches 377 F g&#8722;1 and the device can operate under a wide temperature range (&#8722;10 to 60 &#176;C).

      <title>Organic Multiferroic Magnetoelastic Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>
The spin&#8211;lattice interaction is an intrinsic property of magnetoelastic coupling. In organic ferromagnetic crystals, the deformed crystal lattice changes the saturation magnetization of ferromagnets to exhibit a remarkable magnetoelastic coupling. Moreover, when stimulated by a magnetic field, the lattice of the ferromagnetic crystals shrinks. Organic magnetoelastic coupling is expected to be of great interest for ultrasensitive spin&#8208;mechanical devices.








Abstract
The design of crystal structures aids the discovery of interesting physical phenomena in organic crystals. In this work, the optimization of the coronene&#8211;tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) structure generates non&#8208;degenerate energy levels of spin&#8208;up and spin&#8208;down electrons after charge transfer, producing spontaneous spin polarization, leading to pronounced ferromagnetism. The deformed crystal lattice can significantly affect the saturation magnetization of organic ferromagnets to present a remarkable magnetoelastic coupling. Furthermore, the magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;induced lattice shrinkage of the ferromagnetic crystals supports a spin&#8211;lattice&#8208;interaction&#8208;dependent magnetoelastic coupling. This concept of organic magnetoelastic coupling will pave the way for the rapid mechanical control of spin polarization in organic multiferroic magnetoelastic materials.

      <title>Lattice&#8208;Strain Engineering of Homogeneous NiS0.5Se0.5 Core&#8211;Shell Nanostructure as a Highly Efficient and Robust Electrocatalyst for Overall Water Splitting</title>
      <dc:description>
A series of tunable lattice&#8208;strained NiSxSe1&#8211;x core&#8208;shell electrocatalysts are synthesized by a facile strategy. The generated lattice strain in NiS0.5Se0.5 can decrease the metal d&#8208;orbital overlap and lead to a closer d&#8208;band center toward the Fermi level, thus optimizing the electronic structure and reaction energy barrier for hydrogen and oxygen evolution process, enhancing the overall water splitting performance.








Abstract
Developing highly&#8208;efficient non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal electrocatalysts for water splitting is crucial for the development of clean and reversible hydrogen energy. Introducing lattice strain is an effective strategy to develop efficient electrocatalysts. However, lattice strain is typically co&#8208;created with heterostructure, vacancy, or substrate effects, which complicate the identification of the strain&#8208;activity correlation. Herein, a series of lattice&#8208;strained homogeneous NiSxSe1&#8722;x nanosheets@nanorods hybrids are designed and synthesized by a facile strategy. The NiS0.5Se0.5 with &#8776;2.7% lattice strain exhibits outstanding activity for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction (HER/OER), affording low overpotentials of 70 and 257 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2, respectively, as well as excellent long&#8208;term durability even at a large current density of 100 mA cm&#8722;2 (300 h), significantly superior to other benchmarks and the precious metal catalysts. Experimental and theoretical calculation results reveal that the generated lattice strain decreases the metal d&#8208;orbital overlap, leading to a narrower bandwidth and a closer d&#8208;band center toward the Fermi level. Thus, NiS0.5Se0.5 possesses favorable H* adsorption kinetics for HER and lower energy barriers for OER. This work provides a new insight to regulate the lattice strain of advanced catalyst materials and further improve the performance of energy conversion technologies.

      <title>TFT Channel Materials for Display Applications: From Amorphous Silicon to Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
      <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance thin&#8208;film&#8208;transistor (TFT) channel materials are essential components in future displays with novel functions and form factors. The basic materials properties and their TFT applications are discussed, focusing mainly on their performance. In addition, other key considerations such as bias&#8208; and light&#8208;stability are also covered.








Abstract
As the need for super&#8208;high&#8208;resolution displays with various form factors has increased, it has become necessary to produce high&#8208;performance thin&#8208;film transistors (TFTs) that enable faster switching and higher current driving of each pixel in the display. Over the past few decades, hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a&#8208;Si:H) has been widely utilized as a TFT channel material. More recently, to meet the requirement of new types of displays such as organic light&#8208;emitting diode displays, and also to overcome the performance and reliability issues of a&#8208;Si:H, low&#8208;temperature polycrystalline silicon and amorphous oxide semiconductors have partly replaced a&#8208;Si:H channel materials. Basic material properties and device structures of TFTs in commercial displays are explored, and then the potential of atomically thin layered transition metal dichalcogenides as next&#8208;generation channel materials is discussed.

      <title>Metamaterials for Enhanced Optical Responses and their Application to Active Control of Terahertz Waves</title>
      <dc:description>
Passive and active metamaterials are important to the development of unconventional terahertz optical devices due to their engineered optical responses, such as enhanced optical responses, electrical control, and spatiotemporal control. These materials are reviewed, with emphasis on metamaterials for engineering of terahertz waves, from the regime of passive devices to broader areas in which functionalized active terahertz devices are particularly required.








Abstract
Metamaterials, artificially constructed structures that mimic lattices in natural materials, have made numerous contributions to the development of unconventional optical devices. With an increasing demand for more diverse functionalities, terahertz (THz) metamaterials are also expanding their domain, from the realm of mere passive devices to the broader area where functionalized active THz devices are particularly required. A brief review on THz metamaterials is given with a focus on research conducted in the authors' group. The first part is centered on enhanced THz optical responses from tightly coupled meta&#8208;atom structures, such as high refractive index, enhanced optical activity, anomalous wavelength scaling, large phase retardation, and nondispersive polarization rotation. Next, electrically gated graphene metamaterials are reviewed with an emphasis on the functionalization of enhanced THz optical responses. Finally, the linear frequency conversion of THz waves in a rapidly time&#8208;variant THz metamaterial is briefly discussed in the more general context of spatiotemporal control of light.

Abstract
One of the key breakthroughs enabling flexible electronics with novel form factors is the deployment of flexible polymer films in place of brittle glass, which is one of the major structural materials for conventional electronic devices. Flexible electronics requires polymer films with the core properties of glass (i.e., dimensional stability and transparency) while retaining the pliability of the polymer, which, however, is fundamentally intractable due to the mutually exclusive nature of these characteristics. An overview of a transparent fiber&#8208;reinforced polymer, which is suggested as a potentially viable structural material for emerging flexible/wearable electronics, is provided. This includes material concept and fabrication and a brief review of recent research progress on its applications over the past decade.

Abstract
Control of magnetization in magnetic nanostructures is essential for development of spintronic devices because it governs fundamental device characteristics such as energy consumption, areal density, and operation speed. In this respect, spin&#8211;orbit torque (SOT), which originates from the spin&#8211;orbit interaction, has been widely investigated due to its efficient manipulation of the magnetization using in&#8208;plane current. SOT spearheads novel spintronic applications including high&#8208;speed magnetic memories, reconfigurable logics, and neuromorphic computing. Herein, recent advances in SOT research, highlighting the considerable benefits and challenges of SOT&#8208;based spintronic devices, are reviewed. First, the materials and structural engineering that enhances SOT efficiency are discussed. Then major experimental results for field&#8208;free SOT switching of perpendicular magnetization are summarized, which includes the introduction of an internal effective magnetic field and the generation of a distinct spin current with out&#8208;of&#8208;plane spin polarization. Finally, advanced SOT functionalities are presented, focusing on the demonstration of reconfigurable and complementary operation in spin logic devices.

      <title>Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes: Pushing Toward the Limits and Beyond</title>
      <dc:description>
Various approaches to enhance the outcoupling efficiency of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) are presented along with a discussion as to what can be done further to realize their ultimate potential. Recent efforts to extend the applications of OLEDs beyond displays are also highlighted. As such examples, OLED&#8208;based health&#8208;monitoring sensors, wearable phototherapeutic patches, and fabric&#8208;like OLEDs are introduced.








Abstract
Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) are established as a mainstream light source for display applications and can now be found in a plethora of consumer electronic devices used daily. This success can be attributed to the rich luminescent properties of organic materials, but efficiency enhancement made over the last few decades has also played a significant role in making OLEDs a practically viable technology. This report summarizes the efforts made so far to improve the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of OLEDs and discusses what should further be done to push toward the ultimate efficiency that can be offered by OLEDs. The study indicates that EQE close to 58% and 80% can be within reach without and with additional light extraction structures, respectively, with an optimal combination of cavity engineering, low&#8208;index transport layers, and horizontal dipole orientation. In addition, recent endeavors to identify possible applications of OLEDs beyond displays are presented with emphasis on their potential in wearable healthcare, such as OLED&#8208;based pulse oximetry as well as phototherapeutic applications based on body&#8208;attachable flexible OLED patches. OLEDs with fabric&#8208;like form factors and washable encapsulation strategies are also introduced as technologies essential to the success of OLED&#8208;based wearable electronics.

     alt="Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes: Pushing Toward the Limits and Beyond"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various approaches to enhance the outcoupling efficiency of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) are presented along with a discussion as to what can be done further to realize their ultimate potential. Recent efforts to extend the applications of OLEDs beyond displays are also highlighted. As such examples, OLED&#8208;based health&#8208;monitoring sensors, wearable phototherapeutic patches, and fabric&#8208;like OLEDs are introduced.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) are established as a mainstream light source for display applications and can now be found in a plethora of consumer electronic devices used daily. This success can be attributed to the rich luminescent properties of organic materials, but efficiency enhancement made over the last few decades has also played a significant role in making OLEDs a practically viable technology. This report summarizes the efforts made so far to improve the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of OLEDs and discusses what should further be done to push toward the ultimate efficiency that can be offered by OLEDs. The study indicates that EQE close to 58% and 80% can be within reach without and with additional light extraction structures, respectively, with an optimal combination of cavity engineering, low&#8208;index transport layers, and horizontal dipole orientation. In addition, recent endeavors to identify possible applications of OLEDs beyond displays are presented with emphasis on their potential in wearable healthcare, such as OLED&#8208;based pulse oximetry as well as phototherapeutic applications based on body&#8208;attachable flexible OLED patches. OLEDs with fabric&#8208;like form factors and washable encapsulation strategies are also introduced as technologies essential to the success of OLED&#8208;based wearable electronics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Polydopamine and Its Derivative Surface Chemistry in Material Science: A Focused Review for Studies at KAIST</title>
      <dc:description>
Polydopamine coating, the first material&#8208;independent surface chemistry, and its derivative methods influence nearly all areas of material sciences. Polydopamine chemistry&#8212;material science of four categories (catechol&#8208;containing small molecules, catechol&#8208;tethered polymers, gallol&#8208;containing small molecules, and gallol&#8208;conjugated polymers)&#8212;is discussed in detail.








Abstract
Polydopamine coating, the first material&#8208;independent surface chemistry, and its related methods significantly influence virtually all areas of material science and engineering. Functionalized surfaces of metal oxides, synthetic polymers, noble metals, and carbon materials by polydopamine and its related derivatives exhibit a variety of properties for cell culture, microfluidics, energy storage devices, superwettability, artificial photosynthesis, encapsulation, drug delivery, and numerous others. Unlike other articles, this review particularly focuses on the development of material science utilizing polydopamine and its derivatives coatings at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology for a decade. Herein, it is demonstrated how material&#8208;independent coating methods provide solutions for challenging problems existed in many interdisciplinary areas in bio&#8208;, energy&#8208;, and nanomaterial science by collaborations and independent research.

      <title>Disordered Optics: Exploiting Multiple Light Scattering and Wavefront Shaping for Nonconventional Optical Elements</title>
      <dc:description>
Recent progress on disordered materials is summarized. By exploiting disorder in materials using optical wavefront&#8208;shaping techniques, great potential is shown in enabling functionalities that go beyond their conventional materials, while exhibiting advantages in reduced form factors. Disordered materials will play important roles in both basic physical studies and their application in nanotechnology.








Abstract
Advances in diverse areas such as inspection, imaging, manufacturing, telecommunications, and information processing have been stimulated by novel optical devices. Conventional material ingredients for these devices are typically made of homogeneous refractive or diffractive materials and require sophisticated design and fabrication, which results in practical limitations related to their form and functional figures of merit. To overcome such limitations, recent developments in the application of disordered materials as novel optical elements have indicated great potential in enabling functionalities that go beyond their conventional counterparts, while the materials exhibit potential advantages with respect to reduced form factors. Combined with wavefront shaping, disordered materials enable dynamic transitions between multiple functionalities in a single active optical device. Recent progress in this field is summarized to gain insight into the physical principles behind disordered optics with regard to their advantages in various applications as well as their limitations compared to conventional optics.

      <title>Closest Packing Polymorphism Interfaced Metastable Transition Metal for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution</title>
      <dc:description>
A closest packing polymorphism interface is constructed between metastable hexagonal&#8208;close&#8208;packed phase and its stable counterpart (face&#8208;centered cubic) in a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalyst, promoting the catalytic activity and long&#8208;term durability towards the alkaline hydrogen evolution process.








Abstract
Metastable materials are promising because of their catalytic properties, high&#8208;energy structure, and unique electronic environment. However, the unstable nature inherited from the metastability hinders further performance improvement and practical applications of these materials. Herein, this limitation is successfully addressed by constructing an in situ polymorphism interface (inf) between the metastable hexagonal&#8208;close&#8208;packed (hcp) phase and its stable counterpart (face&#8208;centered cubic, fcc) in cobalt&#8211;nickel (CoNi) alloy. Calculations reveal that the interfacial synergism derived from the hcp and fcc phases lowers the formation energy and enhances stability. Consequently, the optimized CoNi&#8208;inf exhibits an exceptionally low potential of 72&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a Tafel slope of 57&#160;mV dec&#8722;1 for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 1.0 m KOH. Furthermore, it is superior to most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based HER catalysts. No noticeable activity decay or structural changes are observed even over 14 h of catalysis. The computational simulation further rationalizes that the interface of CoNi&#8208;inf with a suitable d&#8208;band center provides uniform sites for hydrogen adsorption, leading to a distinguished HER catalytic activity. This work, therefore, presents a new route for designing metastable catalysts for potential energy conversion.

      <title>Tuning the Structural and Optoelectronic Properties of Cs2AgBiBr6 Double&#8208;Perovskite Single Crystals through Alkali&#8208;Metal Substitution</title>
      <dc:description>
The search for nontoxic perovskite materials with long&#8208;term stability provides new opportunities for optoelectronics. Alkali&#8208;substituted compounds based on the double perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6 are scrutinized in terms of their photo&#8208;physical and structural properties. Cation&#8208;substitution entails an enhanced carrier recombination lifetime and, in combination with the tunability in the sensitivity to X&#8208;rays, makes these materials suitable for applications in X&#8208;ray detectors.








Abstract
Lead&#8208;free double perovskites have great potential as stable and nontoxic optoelectronic materials. Recently, Cs2AgBiBr6 has emerged as a promising material, with suboptimal photon&#8208;to&#8208;charge carrier conversion efficiency, yet well suited for high&#8208;energy photon&#8208;detection applications. Here, the optoelectronic and structural properties of pure Cs2AgBiBr6 and alkali&#8208;metal&#8208;substituted (Cs1&#8722;xYx)2AgBiBr6 (Y: Rb+, K+, Na+; x&#160;= 0.02) single crystals are investigated. Strikingly, alkali&#8208;substitution entails a tunability to the material system in its response to X&#8208;rays and structural properties that is most strongly revealed in Rb&#8208;substituted compounds whose X&#8208;ray sensitivity outperforms other double&#8208;perovskite&#8208;based devices reported. While the fundamental nature and magnitude of the bandgap remains unchanged, the alkali&#8208;substituted materials exhibit a threefold boost in their fundamental carrier recombination lifetime at room temperature. Moreover, an enhanced electron&#8211;acoustic phonon scattering is found compared to Cs2AgBiBr6. The study thus paves the way for employing cation substitution to tune the properties of double perovskites toward a new material platform for optoelectronics.

      <title>Printable CsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells with PCE of 19% via an Additive Strategy</title>
      <dc:description>
The development of the first high&#8208;performance, printable CsPbI3 solar cells via an ambient blade&#8208;coating technique is reported. High&#8208;quality CsPbI3 films are grown via the introduction of a low concentration of the multifunctional molecular additive Zn(C6F5)2. As a result, the additive&#8208;treated perovskite solar cell delivers a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19%.








Abstract
All&#8208;inorganic CsPbI3 holds promise for efficient tandem solar cells, but reported fabrication techniques are not transferrable to scalable manufacturing methods. Herein, printable CsPbI3 solar cells are reported, in which the charge transporting layers and photoactive layer are deposited by fast blade&#8208;coating at a low temperature (&#8804;100 &#176;C)&#160;in ambient conditions. High&#8208;quality CsPbI3 films are grown via introducing a low concentration of the multifunctional molecular additive Zn(C6F5)2, which reconciles the conflict between air&#8208;flow&#8208;assisted fast drying and low&#8208;quality film including energy misalignment and trap formation. Material analysis reveals a preferential accumulation of the additive close to the perovskite/SnO2 interface and strong chemisorption on the perovskite surface, which leads to the formation of energy gradients and suppressed trap formation within the perovskite film, as well as a 150 meV improvement of the energetic alignment at the perovskite/SnO2 interface. The combined benefits translate into significant enhancement of the power conversion efficiency to 19% for printable solar cells. The devices without encapsulation degrade only by &#8776;2% after 700 h in air conditions.

     alt="Printable CsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells with PCE of 19% via an Additive Strategy"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of the first high&#8208;performance, printable CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; solar cells via an ambient blade&#8208;coating technique is reported. High&#8208;quality CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; films are grown via the introduction of a low concentration of the multifunctional molecular additive Zn(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. As a result, the additive&#8208;treated perovskite solar cell delivers a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19%.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All&#8208;inorganic CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; holds promise for efficient tandem solar cells, but reported fabrication techniques are not transferrable to scalable manufacturing methods. Herein, printable CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; solar cells are reported, in which the charge transporting layers and photoactive layer are deposited by fast blade&#8208;coating at a low temperature (&#8804;100 &#176;C)&#160;in ambient conditions. High&#8208;quality CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; films are grown via introducing a low concentration of the multifunctional molecular additive Zn(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which reconciles the conflict between air&#8208;flow&#8208;assisted fast drying and low&#8208;quality film including energy misalignment and trap formation. Material analysis reveals a preferential accumulation of the additive close to the perovskite/SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; interface and strong chemisorption on the perovskite surface, which leads to the formation of energy gradients and suppressed trap formation within the perovskite film, as well as a 150 meV improvement of the energetic alignment at the perovskite/SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; interface. The combined benefits translate into significant enhancement of the power conversion efficiency to 19% for printable solar cells. The devices without encapsulation degrade only by &#8776;2% after 700 h in air conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Solution&#8208;Processable Pure Green Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitter Based on the Multiple Resonance Effect</title>
      <dc:description>
A thermally activated delayed fluorescence material featuring multiple resonance effect of boron, nitrogen, and oxygen atoms (OAB&#8208;ABP&#8208;1) is synthesized by one&#8208;shot double borylation. A solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) device using OAB&#8208;ABP&#8208;1 exhibits pure green electroluminescence with a small full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum, and a high external quantum efficiency with minimum efficiency roll&#8208;off.








Abstract
Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials based on the multiple resonance (MR) effect are applied in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), combining high color purity and efficiency. However, they are not fabricated via solution&#8208;processing, which is an economical approach toward the mass production of OLED displays. Here, a solution&#8208;processable MR&#8208;TADF material (OAB&#8208;ABP&#8208;1), with an extended &#960;&#8208;skeleton and bulky substituents, is designed. OAB&#8208;ABP&#8208;1 is synthesized from commercially available starting materials via a four&#8208;step process involving one&#8208;shot double borylation. OAB&#8208;ABP&#8208;1 presents attractive photophysical properties, a narrow emission band, a high photoluminescence quantum yield, a small energy gap between S1 and T1, and low activation energy for reverse intersystem crossing. These properties are attributed to the alternating localization of the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals induced by the boron, nitrogen, and oxygen atoms. Furthermore, to facilitate charge recombination, two novel semiconducting polymers with similar ionization potentials to that of OAB&#8208;ABP&#8208;1 are synthesized for use as interlayer and emissive layer materials. A solution&#8208;processed OLED device is fabricated using OAB&#8208;ABP&#8208;1 and the aforementioned polymers; it exhibits pure green electroluminescence with a small full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum and a high external quantum efficiency with minimum efficiency roll&#8208;off.

      <title>4D&#8208;Printed Transformable Tube Array for High&#8208;Throughput 3D Cell Culture and Histology</title>
      <dc:description>
A 4D&#8208;printed transformable culture tube array (TTA) can directly transfer a large number of 3D culture models from a microwell plate to a histology cassette, enabling rapid and parallel histological analysis. A seamless workflow from cell culture to histological analysis is demonstrated with human neural progenitor cell (hNPC) spheroids cultured in the TTA.








Abstract
3D cell cultures are rapidly emerging as a promising tool to model various human physiologies and pathologies by closely recapitulating key characteristics and functions of in vivo microenvironment. While high&#8208;throughput 3D culture is readily available using multi&#8208;well plates, assessing the internal microstructure of 3D cell cultures still remains extremely slow because of the manual, laborious, and time&#8208;consuming histological procedures. Here, a 4D&#8208;printed transformable tube array (TTA) using a shape&#8208;memory polymer that enables massively parallel histological analysis of 3D cultures is presented. The interconnected TTA can be programmed to be expanded by 3.6 times of its printed dimension to match the size of a multi&#8208;well plate, with the ability to restore its original dimension for transferring all cultures to a histology cassette in order. Being compatible with microtome sectioning, the TTA allows for parallel histology processing for the entire samples cultured in a multi&#8208;well plate. The test result with human neural progenitor cell spheroids suggests a remarkable reduction in histology processing time by an order of magnitude. High&#8208;throughput analysis of 3D cultures enabled by this TTA has great potential to further accelerate innovations in various 3D culture applications such as high&#8208;throughput/content screening, drug discovery, disease modeling, and personalized medicine.
