         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radiative cooling controls surface optical properties for solar and thermal radiation, offering solutions for global warming and energy savings. Despite significant advances, key challenges remain: optimizing optical efficiency, maintaining aesthetics, preventing overcooling, enhancing durability, and enabling scalable production. This review explores advanced solutions in material design and fabrication to guide future research and industrial applications.








Abstract
Radiative cooling is achieved by controlling surface optical behavior toward solar and thermal radiation, offering promising solutions for mitigating global warming, promoting energy saving, and enhancing environmental protection. Despite significant efforts to develop optical surfaces in various forms, five primary challenges remain for practical applications: enhancing optical efficiency, maintaining appearance, managing overcooling, improving durability, and enabling scalable manufacturing. However, a comprehensive review bridging these gaps is currently lacking. This work begins by introducing the optical fundamentals of radiative cooling and its potential applications. It then explores the challenges and discusses advanced solutions through structural design, material selection, and fabrication processes. It aims to provide guidance for future research and industrial development of radiative cooling technology.

         <title>In Situ Electrochemical Evolution of Amorphous Metallic Borides Enabling Long Cycling Room&#8208;/Subzero&#8208;Temperature Sodium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reveals that the amorphous phase of Ni&#8208;B exhibits a higher propensity for electrochemical phase evolution in Na&#8208;S batteries when compared to its crystalline counterpart. This multiphase transformation enhances the density of active sites on the catalyst, accelerates the sulfur conversion reactions, and sheds new light on the catalytic mechanisms involved in sulfur conversion processes.








Abstract
Room temperature sodium&#8208;sulfur batteries (RT Na&#8208;S) have garnered significant attention for their high energy density and cost&#8208;effectiveness, positioning them as a promising alternative to lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, they encounter challenges such as the dissolution of sodium polysulfides and sluggish kinetics. Introducing high&#8208;activity electrocatalysts and enhancing the density of active sites represents an efficient strategy to enhance reaction kinetics. Here, an amorphous Ni&#8208;B material that undergoes electrochemical evolution to generate the NiSx phase within an operational sodium&#8208;sulfur battery, contrasting with the crystalline NiB counterpart is fabricated. Electrochemical cycling facilitated the establishment of an interface between the amorphous Ni&#8208;B and NiSx, leading to heightened catalytic activity and improved reaction kinetics. Consequently, batteries utilizing the amorphous Ni&#8208;B showcased a notable initial specific capacity of 1487 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.2 A g&#8722;1, exhibiting exceptional performance under high current densities of 5 A g&#8722;1, in low&#8208;temperature conditions (&#8722;10&#160;&#176;C), with high sulfur loading, and in pouch cell configurations.

         <title>Ultrabroadband and &gt;93% Microwave Absorption Enabled by &#8220;Doped&#8221; Water Meta&#8208;Atom Lattice with Subwavelength Thickness</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by atomic doping techniques used in conventional optical materials to broaden spectral bandwidths, a single&#8208;layer microfluidic metasurface microwave absorber composed of two distinct types of &#8220;water meta&#8208;atoms&#8221; is proposed. Experimental measurements reveal over 93% absorption across both K and Ka bands (17.5&#8722;40.0&#160;GHz), featuring a relative bandwidth of up to 78.3% centered around the resonant frequency.








Abstract
Perfect microwave absorbers, which absorb electromagnetic waves completely, play pivotal roles in electromagnetic shielding, and stealth technologies. Existing microwave absorber technologies rely on either electromagnetic properties of absorptive materials, the resonance behavior of meta&#8208;atoms, or a combination of both. So far, achieving simultaneous broadband absorption, high efficiency, and compact sizes remains a great challenge. Inspired by atomic doping techniques employed in conventional optical materials to broaden spectral bandwidths, a single&#8208;layer microfluidic metasurface microwave absorber is proposed with the assembly of two distinct types of water meta&#8208;atoms. By manipulating electromagnetic resonances of these water meta&#8208;atoms, the metasurface maintains impedance matching over a broad working range. A microwave absorber design with a thickness equivalent to 0.2 times the central wavelength is showcased, measuring over 93% absorption across both K and Ka bands (17.5&#8722;40.0&#160;GHz). The results highlight unprecedented superiorities of microwave absorbers based on a 2D doped water meta&#8208;atom lattice when compared to previously reported metasurface absorbers utilizing identical meta&#8208;atoms. This absorber has advantages including small thickness, broad bandwidth, and cost&#8208;effectiveness, making it promising for applications in electromagnetic shielding, camouflage, and multi&#8208;spectral stealth.

         <title>A Highly&#8208;Sensitive Omnidirectional Acoustic Sensor for Enhanced Human&#8211;Machine Interaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stereo acoustic sensor (SAS) with high sensitivity (3172.9 mVpp Pa&#8722;1) is proposed to realize omnidirectional sound recognition and tracking. The SAS can identify the desired audio signal with 98% deep learning accuracy, even in noisy. Moreover, the SAS can simultaneously recognize multiple individuals in the auxiliary conference system and the driving commands under background music in self&#8208;driving vehicles.








Abstract
Acoustic sensor&#8208;based human&#8211;machine interaction (HMI) plays a crucial role in natural and efficient communication in intelligent robots. However, accurately identifying and tracking omnidirectional sound sources, especially in noisy environments still remains a notable challenge. Here, a self&#8208;powered triboelectric stereo acoustic sensor (SAS) with omnidirectional sound recognition and tracking capabilities by a 3D structure configuration is presented. The SAS incorporates a porous vibrating film with high electron affinity and low Young's modulus, resulting in high sensitivity (3172.9 mVpp Pa&#8722;1) and a wide frequency response range (100&#8211;20 000 Hz). By utilizing its omnidirectional sound recognition capability and adjustable resonant frequency feature, the SAS can precisely identify the desired audio signal with an average deep learning accuracy of 98%, even in noisy environments. Moreover, the SAS can simultaneously recognize multiple individuals in the auxiliary conference system and the driving commands under background music in self&#8208;driving vehicles, which marks a notable advance in voice&#8208;based HMI systems.

         <title>Pulling the Rug Out from Under: Biomechanical Microenvironment Remodeling for Induction of Hepatic Stellate Cell Quiescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In HSCs, PPNH&#8208;LQs trigger ascorbic acid oxidation and LOXL2 expression inhibition (Gear I). These effects impair processes of collagen I hydroxylation and enzyme&#8208;mediated crosslinking, leading to the impeded deposition and crosslinking of collagen I (Gear II). Consequently, the fibrotic biomechanical microenvironment can be remodeled and subsequently induce HSC quiescence, which facilitates the reversal of hepatic fibrosis (Gear III).








Abstract
Hepatic fibrosis progresses concomitantly with a variety of biomechanical alternations, especially increased liver stiffness. These biomechanical alterations have long been considered as pathological consequences. Recently, growing evidence proposes that these alternations result in the fibrotic biomechanical microenvironment, which drives the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). Here, an inorganic ascorbic acid&#8208;oxidase (AAO) mimicking nanozyme loaded with liquiritigenin (LQ) is developed to trigger remodeling of the fibrotic biomechanical microenvironment. The AAO mimicking nanozyme is able to consume intracellular ascorbic acid, thereby impeding collagen I deposition by reducing its availability. Simultaneously, LQ inhibits the transcription of lysyl oxidase like 2 (LOXL2), thus impeding collagen I crosslinking. Through its synergistic activities, the prepared nanosystem efficiently restores the fibrotic biomechanical microenvironment to a near&#8208;normal physiological condition, promoting the quiescence of HSCs and regression of fibrosis. This strategy of remodeling the fibrotic biomechanical microenvironment, akin to &#8220;pulling the rug out from under&#8221;, effectively treats hepatic fibrosis in mice, thereby highlighting the importance of tissue biomechanics and providing a potential approach to improve hepatic fibrosis treatment.

Through its synergistic activities, the prepared nanosystem efficiently restores the fibrotic biomechanical microenvironment to a near-normal physiological condition, promoting the quiescence of HSCs and regression of fibrosis. This strategy of remodeling the fibrotic biomechanical microenvironment, akin to &#8220;pulling the rug out from under&#8221;, effectively treats hepatic fibrosis in mice, thereby highlighting the importance of tissue biomechanics and providing a potential approach to improve hepatic fibrosis treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Charge Carrier Density in Organic Semiconductors Modulates the Effective Capacitance: A Unified View of Electrolyte Gated Organic Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A framework for electrolyte gated organic transistors (EGOTs) that unifies electrolyte&#8208;gated organic field&#8208;effect transistors (EGOFETs) with organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) is proposed. The effective capacitance that drives the device response arises from in series capacitances of device interfaces and the chemical capacitance of the organic semiconductor. The model predicts the shape of the transfer curve of EGOTs (p&#8208;/n&#8208;type and ambipolar).








Abstract
A framework for electrolyte&#8208;gated organic transistors (EGOTs) that unifies the view of interfacial capacitive coupling of electrolyte&#8208;gated organic field&#8208;effect transistors (EGOFETs) with the volumetric capacitive coupling in organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) is proposed. The EGOT effective capacitance arises from in&#8208;series capacitances of the electrolyte/gate electrode and electrolyte/channel interfaces, and the chemical capacitance of the organic semiconductor channel whose weight with respect to the interfacial capacitance is modulated by the charge carrier density, hence by the gate voltage. The expression for chemical capacitance is derived from the DOS of the organic semiconductor, which it is assumed to exhibit exponential energy disorder in the HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap. The analytical expression of the EGOT current is assessed on experimental data and shown to accurately predict the shape of the whole transfer curve of an EGOT thus allowing to extract accurate values for the switch&#8208;on voltage and the interfacial transconductance, without assumptions on specific response regime and, in OECT, without invoking the volumetric capacitance. Interestingly, the EGOT model recovers EGOFET and OECT as limit cases and, in the latter case, explicitly represents the volumetric capacitance in terms of the energy disorder and the bandgap of the organic semiconductor.

         <title>Boosting Light&#8722;Matter Interactions in Plasmonic Nanogaps</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Plasmonic nanogap systems enhance optical processes via antenna or cavity plasmon modes, which are influenced by gap morphology. Emitters such as self&#8208;assembled monolayer molecules, quantum dots, and 2D materials couple within the nanogaps. The resulting enhanced optical processes include Raman scattering, infrared absorption, nonlinear optics, photoluminescence, strong coupling, electroluminescence, and photochemistry.








Abstract
Plasmonic nanogaps in strongly coupled metal nanostructures can confine light to nanoscale regions, leading to huge electric field enhancement. This unique capability makes plasmonic nanogaps powerful platforms for boosting light&#8211;matter interactions, thereby enabling the rapid development of novel phenomena and applications. This review traces the progress of nanogap systems characterized by well&#8208;defined morphologies, controllable optical responses, and a focus on achieving extreme performance. The properties of plasmonic gap modes in far&#8208;field resonance and near&#8208;field enhancement are explored and a detailed comparative analysis of nanogap fabrication techniques down to sub&#8208;nanometer scales is provided, including bottom&#8208;up, top&#8208;down, and their combined approaches. Additionally, recent advancements and applications across various frontier research areas are highlighted, including surface&#8208;enhanced spectroscopy, plasmon&#8208;exciton strong coupling, nonlinear optics, optoelectronic devices, and other applications beyond photonics. Finally, the challenges and promising emerging directions in the field are discussed, such as light&#8208;driven atomic effects, molecular optomechanics, and alternative new materials.

         <title>Boolean Computation in Single&#8208;Transistor Neuron</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates an in situ reconfigurable &#8220;computing neuron&#8221; prototype with wafer&#8208;scale fabrication distinguished from a widespread collapsed integrator artificial neuron. The ambipolar nature can be further adapted to construct highly efficient soft&#8208;XOR&#8208;based neural networks.








Abstract
Brain neurons exhibit far more sophisticated and powerful information&#8208;processing capabilities than the simple integrators commonly modeled in neuromorphic computing. A biological neuron can in fact efficiently perform Boolean algebra, including linear nonseparable operations. Traditional logic circuits require more than a dozen transistors combined as NOT, AND, and OR gates to implement XOR. Lacking biological competency, artificial neural networks require multilayered solutions to exercise XOR operation. Here, it is shown that a single&#8208;transistor neuron, harnessing the intrinsic ambipolarity of graphene and ionic filamentary dynamics, can enable in situ reconfigurable multiple Boolean operations from linear separable to linear nonseparable in an ultra&#8208;compact design. By leveraging the spatiotemporal integration of inputs, bio&#8208;realistic spiking&#8208;dependent Boolean computation is fully realized, rivaling the efficiency of a human brain. Furthermore, a soft&#8208;XOR&#8208;based neural network via algorithm&#8208;hardware co&#8208;design, showcasing substantial performance improvement, is demonstrated. These results demonstrate how the artificial neuron, in the ultra&#8208;compact form of a single transistor, may function as a powerful platform for Boolean operations. These findings are anticipated to be a starting point for implementing more sophisticated computations at the individual transistor neuron level, leading to super&#8208;scalable neural networks for resource&#8208;efficient brain&#8208;inspired information processing.

         <title>Responsive Magnetic Particle Imaging Tracer: Overcoming &#8220;Always&#8208;On&#8221; Limitation, Eliminating Interference, and Ensuring Safety in Adaptive Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This responsive MPI tracer for subtraction&#8208;enhanced MPI imaging, accurate molecular imaging, and environment&#8208;adaptive therapy, offers the potential to maximize therapeutic outcomes and minimize side effects. This technique effectively eliminates interference signals originating from non&#8208;specific liver uptake.








Abstract
Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) has emerged as a novel technology utilizing superparamagnetic nanoparticles as tracers, essential for disease diagnosis and treatment guidance in preclinical animal models. Unlike other modalities, MPI provides high sensitivity, deep tissue penetration, and no signal attenuation. However, existing MPI tracers suffer from &#8220;always&#8208;on&#8221; signals, which complicate organ&#8208;specific imaging and hinder accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we have developed a responsive MPI tracer using pH&#8208;responsive PdFe alloy particles coated with a gatekeeper polymer. This tracer exhibits pH&#8208;sensitive Fe release and modulation of the MPI signal, enabling selective imaging with a higher signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio and intratumoral pH quantification. Notably, this responsive tracer facilitates subtraction&#8208;enhanced MPI imaging, effectively eliminating interference from liver uptake and expanding the scope of abdominal imaging. Additionally, the tracer employs a dual&#8208;function mechanism for adaptive cancer therapy, combining pH&#8208;switchable enzyme&#8208;like catalysis with dual&#8208;key co&#8208;activation of ROS generation, and Pd skeleton that scavenges free radicals to minimize Fe&#8208;related toxicity. This advancement promises to significantly expand MPI's applicability in diagnostics and therapeutic monitoring, marking a leap forward in imaging technology.

         <title>Measurement of Enhanced Spin&#8208;Orbit Coupling Strength for Donor&#8208;Bound Electron Spins in Silicon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A significant enhancement in spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) within multi&#8208;donor silicon quantum dots is demonstrated, showing SOC strengths up to 40 &#181;eV, surpassing previous benchmarks by two orders of magnitude. This advancement paves the way for precise all&#8208;electrical control of donor&#8208;bound spins and improved coupling to superconducting resonators, marking a crucial step forward in quantum computing.








Abstract
While traditionally considered a deleterious effect in quantum dot spin qubits, the spin&#8208;orbit interaction is recently being revisited as it allows for rapid coherent control by on&#8208;chip AC electric fields. For electrons in bulk silicon, spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) is intrinsically weak, however, it can be enhanced at surfaces and interfaces, or through atomic placement. Here it is showed that the strength of the spin&#8208;orbit coupling can be locally enhanced by more than two orders of magnitude in the manybody wave functions of multi&#8208;donor quantum dots compared to a single donor, reaching strengths so far only reported for holes or two&#8208;donor system with certain symmetry. These findings may provide a pathway toward all&#8208;electrical control of donor&#8208;bound spins in silicon using electric dipole spin resonance (EDSR).

         <title>Triggering Asymmetric Layer Displacement Polarization and Redox Dual&#8208;Sites Activation by Inside&#8208;Out Anion Substitution for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The inside chlorine ion substitution on layered Bi4O5Br2 induces an 8&#8240;&#160;shrinkage of the halogen layer, triggering asymmetric [Bi4O5]2+ layer displacement polarization that significantly promotes charge separation. Meanwhile, the surface&#8208;substituted Cl ions activate the intrinsic redox dual&#8208;sites and are also self&#8208;donated as an alien oxidation site. These advantages collaboratively result in a remarkable efficiency in CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO photoreduction over Bi4O5Br2.








Abstract
Sluggish bulk charge transfer and barren catalytic sites severely hinder the CO2 photoreduction process. Seeking strategies for accelerating charge dynamics and activating reduction and oxidation sites synchronously presents a huge challenge. Herein, an inside&#8208;out chlorine (Cl) ions substitution strategy on the layered polar Bi4O5Br2 is proposed for achieving layer structure&#8208;dependent polarization effect and redox dual&#8208;sites activation. Cl ions in the bulk phase shrink the halogen layer interspace by 8&#8240;, triggering asymmetric [Bi4O5]2+ layer displacement polarization, prolonging the average photocharge lifetime to 201.8&#160;ps. Meanwhile, surface substituted Cl ions enhance the electron&#8208;donating capability of neighboring Bi atoms, activating the intrinsic Bi reduction sites, and increasing H2O molecule adsorption on nearby intrinsic O oxidation site (cal. by 0.105&#160;eV), also self&#8208;donating as an alien oxidation site. Besides, Cl upshifts the p&#8208;band center closer to the Fermi level, facilitating the reactant adsorption. Therefore, the energy barrier for CO2 activation and rate&#8208;limiting *COOH intermediate formation steps are significantly decreased. Without cocatalysts and sacrificial reagents, inside&#8208;out Cl&#8208;substituted Bi4O5Br2 delivers a remarkable CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO photoreduction rate of 50.18&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, being one of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts. This finding offers insights into exploiting polarization at the molecular&#8208;level and enhances understanding of catalytic site activation.

         <title>Fine&#8208;Grain High&#8208;Performance Densified Oxide Fibers Produced by Open Ultrafast High&#8208;Temperature Sintering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Open ultrafast high&#8208;temperature sintering (OUHS) in air, characterized by rapid heating/cooling (&gt;10000 K min&#8722;1) and a short high&#8208;temperature holding time (&lt;10 s), is used to produce 3 mol% yttria&#8208;stabilized zirconia continuous fibers with coherent boundaries forming robust connections between fine grains, resulting in efficiently sintered high&#8208;strength polycrystalline oxide fibers.








Abstract
The considerable grain growth occurring during the long&#8208;term high&#8208;temperature sintering of polycrystalline oxide fibers negatively affects their mechanical properties, which highlights the need for alternative sintering methods. Herein, open ultrafast high&#8208;temperature sintering (OUHS) in air, characterized by rapid heating/cooling (&gt;10000 K min&#8722;1) and a short high&#8208;temperature holding time (&lt;10 s), is used to produce 3 mol% yttria&#8208;stabilized zirconia continuous fibers with coherent boundaries forming robust connections between fine grains. The tensile strength of these fibers (2.33&#160;GPa on average, sintering temperature = 1673 K) notably exceeds that of their counterparts produced by traditional sintering (1.17&#160;GPa). The effects of pores on fiber mechanical&#160;properties are analyzed using experimental and theoretical methods. For a versatility demonstration, OUHS is applied to several types of polycrystalline oxide fibers (HfO2, Al2O3, TiO2, Y2O3, and La2Zr2O7), considerably improving their mechanical properties and enabling crystalline phase control, which demonstrates the suitability of this procedure for the development of high&#8208;performance materials.

         <title>Fully Printed and Sweat&#8208;Activated Micro&#8208;Batteries with Lattice&#8208;Match Zn/MoS2 Anode for Long&#8208;Duration Wearables</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fully printed micro&#8208;batteries with lattice&#8208;match Zn/MoS2 anode and novel sweat&#8208;activation capability have the potential for long&#8208;duration wearable devices. The printable Zn powder&#8208;based material is modified with 2D MoS2 to construct Zn anodes with flexibility, high reversibility, dendrite&#8208;free, and low polarization. The micro&#8208;batteries deliver enhanced electrochemical performance via a sweat activation strategy to eliminate the MnO2 cathode by&#8208;products and compensate for the hydrogel electrolytes' water loss.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries with superior operational safety have great promise to serve as wearable energy storage devices. However, the poor cycling stability and low output voltage limited their practical applications. Here, fully printable Zn/MoS2&#8208;MnO2 micro&#8208;batteries are developed and demonstrated significantly enhanced cycling stability with sweat activation. 2D MoS2 is utilized to enable lattice&#8208;matching with Zn powders to realize printed Zn anodes with desirable stability and promote electron/ion transfer. Interestingly, the mild acid epidermal sweat also contributed to eliminating the MnO2 cathode by&#8208;products and compensating for the hydrogel electrolytes' water loss. The Zn/MoS2&#8208;MnO2 micro&#8208;batteries achieve a high specific capacity of 318.9&#160;&#181;Ah&#160;cm&#8722;2 at the current density of 0.16&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, and an energy density of 424.6&#160;&#181;Wh&#160;cm&#8722;2, with remarkable cycle stability of &#8776;90% after 250 cycles. In&#8208;battery electrochromic display of capacity level and feasible electronics charging are demonstrated. The as&#8208;printed micro&#8208;batteries with innovative sweat activation would inspire the advances of sustainable power supply for wearables.

         <title>A Topological Parametric Phonon Oscillator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A topological parametric phonon oscillator is experimentally realized based on a nonlinear nano&#8208;electromechanical Dirac&#8208;vortex cavity with strong squeezed interaction. Fabrication&#8208;disorder&#8208;induced random frequency variation can be suppressed effectively by increasing the cavity size, while the free spectral range reduces at a much slower rate. These results represent an important advance in topological physics with large bosonic nonlinearities and parametric gain.








Abstract
Topological bosonic systems have recently aroused intense interests in exploring exotic phenomena that have no counterparts in electronic systems. The squeezed bosonic interaction in these systems is particularly interesting, because it can modify the vacuum fluctuations of topological states, drive them into instabilities, and lead to topological parametric oscillators. However, these phenomena remain experimentally elusive because of limited nonlinearities in most existing topological bosonic systems. Here, a topological parametric phonon oscillator is experimentally realized based on a nonlinear nano&#8208;electromechanical Dirac&#8208;vortex cavity with strong squeezed interaction. Specifically, the Dirac&#8208;vortex cavity is parametrically driven to provide phase&#8208;sensitive amplification for topological phonons, leading to the observation of coherent parametric phonon oscillation above the threshold. Additionally, it is confirmed that the random frequency variation caused by fabrication disorders can be suppressed effectively by increasing the cavity size while the free spectral range reduces at a much slower rate, which benefits the realization of large&#8208;area single&#8208;mode lasers. These results represent an important advance in experimental investigations of topological physics with large bosonic nonlinearities and parametric gain.

         <title>Xanthate&#8208;Mediated Oxidation of Li2S as the Lithium&#8208;Containing Cathode in Lithium&#8722;Sulfur Batteries with Extremely Low Overpotential</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lithium ethyl xanthate formed from the room&#8208;temperature reaction among Li2S, ethanol, and CS2 is an efficient redox mediator. It has a redox potential (&#8776;2.3&#160;V vs Li+/Li) close to the electrochemical oxidation potential of Li2S (2.25&#160;V vs Li+/Li), can enable fast Li2S oxidation reaction kinetics, and lower the Li2S oxidation potential to &#8776;2.3&#160;V.








Abstract
Lithium&#8722;sulfide (Li2S) has long been pursued as a lithium&#8208;containing cathode material for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries. Unfortunately, its direct oxidation generally has a large overpotential, giving rise to low energy efficiency. The use of redox mediators to accelerate the conversion of solid Li2S to polysulfides represents a possible solution to lower the initial oxidation overpotential. However, most reported redox mediators exhibit significantly higher redox potentials than the desirable value. Herein, it is serendipitously found that lithium ethyl xanthate (LiEX) formed from the reaction among Li2S, ethanol, and CS2 at room temperature is an efficient redox mediator. It has a redox potential (&#8776;2.3&#160;V vs Li+/Li) close to the electrochemical oxidation potential of Li2S (2.25&#160;V vs Li+/Li), which enables fast Li2S oxidation reaction kinetics, and more importantly, lowers the Li2S oxidation potential from &#8776;3.6 to &#8776;2.3&#160;V. When further integrated with an Ni&#8211;NC catalyst in a tandem catalysis scheme, a remarkable specific capacity of &#8776;1100 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and long cycle life of 1400 cycles with &#8764;73% capacity retention is achieved, outperforming those of other Li2S&#8208;based cathode materials from recent literature.

         <title>Peripheral Substitution Engineering of MR&#8208;TADF Emitters Embedded With B&#8210;N Covalent Bond Towards Efficient BT.2020 Blue Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on a novel B&#8211;N embedded framework, a peripheral substitution engineering has been proposed to afford ultrapure blue MR&#8208;TADF emitters, revealing a record&#8208;high EQE of 20.3%, a narrow FWHM of 20&#160;nm and CIE coordinates of (0.152, 0.046) that align with the BT.2020 blue standard.








Abstract
Compared with the classical boron/nitrogen (B/N) doped ones, multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters embedded with B&#8211;N covalent bond behave a significantly blue&#8208;shifted narrowband TADF, and thus show a greater potential in ultrapure blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). As a proof of concept, herein a peripheral substitution engineering is demonstrated based on such a B&#8210;N embedded parent core. The simple approach is found to ensure easy synthesis via a one&#8208;pot lithium&#8208;free borylation&#8208;annulation, manipulate the excited states through different electronic coupling between core and substituent, and introduce the steric hindrance to minimize the unwanted spectral broadening. Impressively, ultrapure blue OLEDs are realized to give a high external quantum efficiency of 20.3% together with Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage coordinates of (0.152, 0.046). The performance is well competent with those of B/N doped MR&#8208;TADF emitters, clearly highlighting that the B&#8210;N embedded framework is a novel promising paradigm towards efficient BT.2020 blue standard.

         <title>The Role of Hydrogen in ReRAM</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantitative measurements reveal high concentrations of hydrogen across many Redox&#8208;based resistive random access memory (ReRAM) devices, exceeding critical thresholds. Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry confirms that this hydrogen diffuses across the reactive interface under electrical biasing, indicating a significant impact on resistive switching. These findings highlight the necessity of incorporating hydrogen dynamics into ReRAM models and the importance of precise impurity control during fabrication to optimize device performance.








Abstract
Previous research on transistor gate oxides reveals a clear link between hydrogen content and oxide breakdown. This has implications for redox&#8208;based resistive random access memory (ReRAM) devices, which exploit soft, reversible, dielectric breakdown, as hydrogen is often not considered in modeling or measured experimentally. Here quantitative measurements, corroborated across multiple techniques are reported, that reveal ReRAM devices, whether manufactured in a university setting or research foundry, contain concentrations of hydrogen at levels likely to impact resistance switching behavior. To the knowledge this is the first empirical measurement depth profiling hydrogen concentration through a ReRAM device. Applying a recently&#8208;developed Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry analysis technique enables to measure hydrogen diffusion across the interfaces of SiOx ReRAM devices as a result of operation. These techniques can be applied to a broad range of devices to further understand ReRAM operation. Careful control of temperatures, precursors, and exposure to ambient during fabrication should limit hydrogen concentration. Additionally, using thin oxynitride or TiO2 capping layers should prevent diffusion of hydrogen and other contaminants into devices during operation. Applying these principles to ReRAM devices will enable considerable, informed, improvements in performance.

         <title>Chiral Inorganic Nanomaterials Characterized by Advanced TEM: A Qualitative and Quantitative Study</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Focusing on chiral inorganic nanomaterials (CINMs), this review elucidates how advanced TEM techniques facilitate precise qualitative analysis of CINMs, including chiral atomic&#8208;level features, 0D, 1D, and 2D nanocrystals, and assemblies. It also highlights quantitative methods for determining chirality, such as 3D electron tomography, and discusses the evolution of chiral structures as monitored by the ex situ and in situ TEM technologies.








Abstract
Chiral inorganic nanomaterials (CINMs) have garnered significant interest due to their exceptional optical, electronic, and catalytic properties, offering promising advancements in energy conversion, data storage, catalysis, and biomedicine. While traditional optical spectrophotometers reveal the chiroptical performance of CINMs on an ensemble level, the direct structural visualization for the qualitative and quantitative discernment of their chiral features has become increasingly distinct with the advancements of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques. The need for reasonable and high&#8208;standard discrimination requirements of CINMs has driven the progress of chirality&#8208;based TEM technologies. Therefore, this review in the good season takes the initiative to summarize the current advancements in TEM technologies for CINMs characterization, emphasizing a qualitative analysis of chiral atomic&#8208;level features, 0D, 1D, and 2D nanocrystals, and assembled nanomaterials. Then, the quantitative methods for determining chirality is also highlighted, such as 3D electron tomography, and further address the evolution of chiral structures monitored by the Ex&#8208;situ and In&#8208;situ TEM technologies. By providing a roadmap for the current challenges and proposing future advancements in TEM technologies for the qualitative, quantitative, and real&#8208;time analysis of CINMs, it can drive innovations in the field of chiral nanomaterials as well as the development of TEM technologies.

         <title>Amorphous to Crystalline Transition in Nanoimprinted Sol&#8211;Gel Titanium Oxide Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wafer&#8208;scale manufacturing platform is introduced for crystalline TiO2 metasurfaces. Anatase or rutile metalenses are fabricated via thermal nanoimprint lithography and sintering. The high refractive index enhances conversion efficiency and numerical aperture. These metalenses demonstrate diffraction&#8208;limited focusing and imaging capabilities, showcasing the potential of crystalline TiO2 in advanced flat optics for improved performance in various applications.








Abstract
Crystalline titanium dioxide (TiO2) (anatase and rutile) possesses a higher refractive index than amorphous TiO2 and near&#8208;zero absorption in the visible region, making them an ideal material for visible metasurfaces. However, fabrication limitations hinder their implementation into flat optics. In this work, a wafer&#8208;scale manufacturing platform is proposed for crystalline TiO2 metasurfaces. Sol&#8211;gel TiO2 is developed as a printable material in which its material phase can be precisely controlled to produce amorphous, anatase, or rutile, depending on the crystallization temperature. Therefore, anatase or rutile metalenses can be fabricated on a wafer scale using thermal nanoimprint lithography and sintering process. The high refractive index of the crystalline TiO2 contributes to the enhanced conversion efficiency of the fabricated metalenses. The fabricated metalenses exhibit diffraction&#8208;limited focusing and imaging capabilities, comparable to the theoretically ideal lenses.

         <title>Dressing AgNWs with MXenes Nanosheets: Transparent Printed Electrodes Combining High&#8208;Conductivity and Tunable Work Function for High&#8208;Performance Opto&#8208;Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Printable highly conductive UV&#8211;vis transparent Ti3C2Tx&#8208;AgNWs electrodes with tunable work functions are assembled by regulating the O&#8208;related terminations on the surface of Ti3C2Tx. The electrode can be customized for energy band matching, e.g. forming Schottky and Ohmic contacts with Ga2O3 and SpiroG in high&#8208;performance Schottky diodes and organic light&#8208;emitting transistors, respectively.








Abstract
High&#8208;work function transparent electrodes (HWFTEs) are key for establishing Schottky and Ohmic contacts with n&#8208;type and p&#8208;type semiconductors, respectively. However, the development of printable materials that combine high transmittance, low sheet resistance, and tunable work function remains an outstanding challenge. This work reports a high&#8208;performance HWFTE composed of Ag nanowires enveloped conformally by Ti3C2Tx nanosheets (TA), forming a shell&#8208;core network structure. The printed TA HWFTEs display an ultrahigh transmittance (&gt;94%) from the deep&#8208;ultraviolet (DUV) to the entire visible spectral region, a low sheet resistance (&lt;15 &#937;&#160;sq&#8722;1), and a tunable work function ranging from 4.7 to 6.0&#160;eV. The introduction of additional oxygen terminations on the Ti3C2Tx surface generates positive dipoles, which not only increases the work function of the TA HWFTEs but also elevates the TA/Ga2O3 Schottky barrier, resulting in a high self&#8208;powered responsivity of 18&#160;mA&#160;W&#8722;1 in Ga2O3 diode DUV photodetectors, as demonstrated via experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations. Furthermore, the TA HWFTEs&#8208;based organic light&#8208;emitting transistors exhibit exceptional emission brightness of 5020&#160;cd m&#8722;2, being four&#8208;fold greater than that in Au electrodes&#8208;based devices. The innovative nano&#8208;structure design, work function tuning, and the revealed mechanisms of electrode&#8208;semiconductor contact physics constitute a substantial advancement in high&#8208;performance optoelectronic technology.

         <dc:description>
Rich diversity of animal vision systems provides valuable inspiration for advancing robotic vision systems. Here, recent developments in bio&#8208;inspired electronic eyes and neuromorphic image sensors drawing inspiration from natural ocular structures and their visual perception mechanisms, as well as their integration examples with mobile robotic and biological systems, are introduced.








Abstract
In robotics, particularly for autonomous navigation and human&#8211;robot collaboration, the significance of unconventional imaging techniques and efficient data processing capabilities is paramount. The unstructured environments encountered by robots, coupled with complex missions assigned to them, present numerous challenges necessitating diverse visual functionalities, and consequently, the development of multifunctional robotic vision systems has become indispensable. Meanwhile, rich diversity inherent in animal vision systems, honed over evolutionary epochs to meet their survival demands across varied habitats, serves as a profound source of inspirations. Here, recent advancements in multifunctional robotic vision systems drawing inspiration from natural ocular structures and their visual perception mechanisms are delineated. First, unique imaging functionalities of natural eyes across terrestrial, aerial, and aquatic habitats and visual signal processing mechanism of humans are explored. Then, designs and functionalities of bio&#8208;inspired electronic eyes are explored, engineered to mimic key components and underlying optical principles of natural eyes. Furthermore, neuromorphic image sensors are discussed, emulating functional properties of synapses, neurons, and retinas and thereby enhancing accuracy and efficiency of robotic vision tasks. Next, integration examples of electronic eyes with mobile robotic/biological systems are introduced. Finally, a forward&#8208;looking outlook on the development of bio&#8208;inspired electronic eyes and neuromorphic image sensors is provided.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Mediated Organic Neurohybrid Synapses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic artificial synapse interacts with non&#8208;electroactive neurotransmitters present in the central nervous system by exploiting key electroactive species (i.e., H2O2) produced by neurotransmitter&#8208;specific enzymatic reactions as synaptic modulator in an electrochemical neruomorphic organic device. This enzyme&#8208;mediated neurohybrid synapse can mimic biological learning&#8208;forgetting processes, showing a faster learning phase once previously learned information is forgotten compared to the initial learning stage.








Abstract
The development of organic artificial synapses that exhibit biomimicry features also may enable a more seamless integration of neuroelectronic devices in the nervous system, allowing artificial neuromodulation to be perceived as natural behavior by neuronal cells. Nevertheless, the capability to interact with both electroactive and non&#8208;electroactive neurotransmitters remains a challenge since state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art devices mainly rely on the oxidation of electroactive species. Here, the study proposes an organic artificial synapse engineered to enable interaction with non&#8208;electroactive species present in the central nervous system. By integrating a conductive polymeric film functionalized with platinum nanoparticles, the device can catalyze the oxidation of electroactive molecules (i.e., H2O2) resulting from neurotransmitter&#8208;specific enzymatic reactions following an enzymatic functionalization, therefore exhibiting neuromorphic functions driven by non&#8208;electroactive neurotransmitters. The creation of devices that can interact with or monitor these neurotransmitters can be seen as a significant step toward innovative technologies to expand the understanding of the mechanisms underlying neurological disorders and the development of novel, more effective treatments for them.

         <title>Physical Field Effects to Suppress Polysulfide Shuttling in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries are long plagued by shuttling effects. A comprehensive overview of strategies and developments is provided here using physical field effects to suppress polysulfide shuttling. It emphasizes physical mechanism of interaction with polysulfides, including electrostatic forces, built&#8208;in electric fields, spin state regulation, strain engineering, magnetic field&#8208;assisted, and light field&#8208;assisted. Additionally, the future challenges and opportunities are discussed.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSB) with high theoretical energy density are plagued by the infamous shuttle effect of lithium polysulfide (LPS) and the sluggish sulfur reduction/evolution reaction. Extensive research is conducted on how to suppress shuttle effects, including physical structure confinement engineering, chemical adsorption strategy, and the design of sulfur redox catalysts. Recently, the rational design to mitigate shuttle effects and enhance reaction kinetics based on physical field effects has been widely studied, providing a more fundamental understanding of interactions with sulfur species. Herein, the physical field effect is focused and their methods and mechanisms of interaction are summarized systematically with LPS. Overall, the working principle of LSB system, the origin of the shuttle effect, and kinetic trouble in LSB are briefly described. Then, the mechanism and application of rational design of materials based on physical field effect concepts and the external physical field&#8208;assisted LSB are elaborated, including electrostatic force, built&#8208;in electric field, spin state regulation, strain engineering, external magnetic field, photoassisted and other physical field&#8208;assisted strategies are pivotally elaborated and discussed. Finally, the potential directions of physical field effects in enhancing the performance and weakening the shuttle effect of high&#8208;energy LSB are summarized and anticipated.

         <title>Light&#8208;Operated Diverse Logic Gates Enabled by Modulating Time&#8208;Dependent Fluorescence of Dissipative Self&#8208;Assemblies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;fueled dissipative self&#8208;assembly systems with variable optical signals are achieved to realize diverse logic gates by modulating time&#8208;dependent fluorescence variations of the loaded fluorophores. It develops diverse light&#8208;operated logic gates, incorporating AND, and XOR operations, by utilizing the on/off irradiation wavelength of photoreaction and fluorescence excitation wavelength as optical inputs, while monitoring time&#8208;dependent changes in fluorescence as outputs.








Abstract
Light&#8208;fueled dissipative self&#8208;assembly possesses enormous potential in the field of optical information due to controllable time&#8208;dependent optical signals, but remains a great challenge for constructing intelligent light&#8208;operated logic circuits due to the limited availability of optical signal inputs and outputs. Herein, a series of light&#8208;fueled dissipative self&#8208;assembly systems with variable optical signals are reported to realize diverse logic gates by modulating time&#8208;dependent fluorescence variations of the loaded fluorophores. Three kinds of alkyl trimethylammonium homologs are employed to co&#8208;assemble with a merocyanine&#8208;based photoinduced amphiphile separately to construct a series of dissipative self&#8208;assemblies, showing unexpectedly different fluorescence control behaviors of loaded fluorophores during light irradiation and thermal relaxation processes. The opposite monotonicity of time&#8208;dependent emission intensity is achieved just by changing the excitation wavelength. Furthermore, by varying the types of trimethylammoniums and excitation wavelengths, a robust logic system is accomplished, integrating AND, XNOR, and XOR functions, which provides an effective pathway for advancing information transmission applications.

&lt;p&gt;Light-fueled dissipative self-assembly systems with variable optical signals are achieved to realize diverse logic gates by modulating time-dependent fluorescence variations of the loaded fluorophores. It develops diverse light-operated logic gates, incorporating AND, and XOR operations, by utilizing the on/off irradiation wavelength of photoreaction and fluorescence excitation wavelength as optical inputs, while monitoring time-dependent changes in fluorescence as outputs.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light-fueled dissipative self-assembly possesses enormous potential in the field of optical information due to controllable time-dependent optical signals, but remains a great challenge for constructing intelligent light-operated logic circuits due to the limited availability of optical signal inputs and outputs. Herein, a series of light-fueled dissipative self-assembly systems with variable optical signals are reported to realize diverse logic gates by modulating time-dependent fluorescence variations of the loaded fluorophores. Three kinds of alkyl trimethylammonium homologs are employed to co-assemble with a merocyanine-based photoinduced amphiphile separately to construct a series of dissipative self-assemblies, showing unexpectedly different fluorescence control behaviors of loaded fluorophores during light irradiation and thermal relaxation processes. The opposite monotonicity of time-dependent emission intensity is achieved just by changing the excitation wavelength. Furthermore, by varying the types of trimethylammoniums and excitation wavelengths, a robust logic system is accomplished, integrating AND, XNOR, and XOR functions, which provides an effective pathway for advancing information transmission applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Blue Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Based on Pure Bromide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compared to unstable&#8208;spectra mixed&#8208;halide perovskites, pure bromide blue perovskites have demonstrated good spectral stability. Here, the recent advances of blue light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs)&#160;on pure bromide perovskites are summarized and categorized according to the different strategies of tuning emission. Moreover, the challenges and research directions for achieving highly bright, efficient, and stable blue perovskite LEDs in the future are also addressed.








Abstract
Blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) are essential for the creation of full&#8208;color displays and white&#8208;light illumination, and some significant progress is made in recent years. However, most high&#8208;performance blue perovskite LEDs are currently based on mixed&#8208;halide perovskites and suffer from unstable spectra due to inevitable halide phase segregation, which is unfavorable for the application of blue perovskite LEDs. In contrast, blue emissions from pure bromide perovskites generally exhibit stable spectra (consistent emission peak positions and spectral shapes) and are worthy of attention. In this review, the recent advances in blue LEDs based on pure bromide perovskites according to different strategies are classified and summarized. Moreover, the challenges related to poor charge injection, high defect&#8208;state density, lack of high&#8208;performance in the deeper blue region, and inferior operational stability are addressed. Finally, an outlook is provided on feasible future research directions for highly bright, efficient, and stable blue perovskite LEDs.

         <title>Atomic Dispersed Co on NC@Cu Core&#8208;Shells for Solar Seawater Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A core&#8208;shell photocatalyst comprising atomic&#8208;dispersed Co and plasmonic Cu nanoparticles is developed for efficient photocatalytic hydrogen production from seawater. This photocatalyst achieves strong synergy between the reaction environment, broad light absorption, plasmonic electric field, and active atomic sites, thereby enabling optimal seawater hydrogen production through redox reactions.








Abstract
With freshwater resources becoming increasingly scarce, the photocatalytic seawater splitting for hydrogen production has garnered widespread attention. In this study, a novel photocatalyst consisting of a Cu core coated is introduced with N&#8208;doped C and decorated with single Co atoms (Co&#8208;NC@Cu) for solar to hydrogen production from seawater. This catalyst, without using noble metals or sacrificial agents, demonstrates superior hydrogen production effficiency of 9080 &#181;molg&#8722;1h&#8722;1, i.e., 4.78% solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen conversion efficiency, and exceptional long&#8208;term stability, operating over 340&#160;h continuously. The superior performance is attributed to several key factors. First, the focus&#8208;light induced photothermal effect enhances redox reaction capabilities, while the salt&#8208;ions enabled charge polarization around catalyst surfaces extends charge carrier lifetime. Furthermore, the Co&#9472;NC@Cu exhibits excellent broad light absorption, promoting photoexcited charge production. Theoretical calculations reveal that Co&#9472;NC acts as the active site, showing low energy barriers for reduction reactions. Additionally, the formation of a strong surface electric field from the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of Cu nanoparticles further reduces energy barriers for redox reactions, improving seawater splitting activity. This work provides valuable insights into intergrating the reaction environment, broad solar absorption, LSPR, and active single atoms into a core&#8208;shell photocatalyst design for efficient and robust solar&#8208;driven seawater splitting.

         <title>Hetero&#8208;Nucleation Induced [111]&#8208;Oriented Mixed Halide Perovskite for Stable Pure Red Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hetero&#8208;nucleation crystallization strategy is reported to grow [111]&#8208;orientation CsPbI3&#8208;xBrx thin films. Remarkably, the [111]&#8208;orientation preferred film exhibits lower halide ion migration possibility and lower defect states than that of [001]&#8208;oriented film, resulting in efficient and stable mixed&#8208;halide pure red LEDs.








Abstract
Mixed halide 3D perovskites are promising for bright, efficient, and wide&#8208;color gamut light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) due to their excellent carrier transport, high luminescence, and easily tunable bandgaps. However, serious halide ion migration inside mixed halide 3D perovskite results in poor operational and spectral stability of the as&#8208;fabricated LEDs. Here, a hetero&#8208;nucleation crystallization strategy is reported to grow [111]&#8208;orientation&#160;preferred mixed halide 3D perovskite CsPbI3&#8208;xBrx thin films for stable pure red LEDs. This hetero&#8208;nucleation crystallization is enabled by the addition of phosphoric acid (H3PO4) complexation, which promotes the growth of small perovskite grains into large grains with uniform [111]&#8208;orientation. The obtained [111]&#8208;orientation preferred film exhibits excellent stability under light or electric field stimulus as revealed by model analysis and experimental results compared to that of [001]&#8208;orientation preferred film. Thus, based on the [111]&#8208;orientation&#160;preferred film, the fabricated LED exhibits an external quantum efficiency of 22.8%, a maximum brightness of 12&#160;000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, and a half&#8208;life time of 4080&#160;min under 1.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. More importantly, the electroluminescence spectrum of the device remains stable during the continuous operation of 4080&#160;min, showcasing the significant spectral stability improvement enabled by the hetero&#8208;nucleation induced [111]&#8208;orientation strategy.

         <title>Internal Capsulation Via Self&#8208;Cross&#8208;linking and &#960;&#8208;Effects Achieves Highly Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes an internal encapsulation strategy utilizing the synergistic effect of in situ cross&#8208;linking and &#960;&#8208;effects, achieving an upgrade of the protective layer from linear to mesh&#8208;like coverage. The internal encapsulated device exhibits an enhanced efficiency of 25.31 % and noticeably improved stability.








Abstract
Pursuing high stability becomes the core challenge in realizing the widespread application of perovskite solar cells (PerSCs). Here, a practical internal&#8208;capsulation strategy is proposed by introducing cross&#8208;linkable methacrylate analogs upon the perovskite layer, hindering ion migration and preventing lead leakage to achieve stable PerSCs. Butyl methacrylate (UMA) and benzyl methacrylate (BMA) can chemically interact with the perovskite layer, especially for the BMA dimer with significant &#960;&#8208;interactions among the hanging benzene rings. Such configuration facilitated more compact coordination, thereby restoring the Fermi level of perovskite to a defect&#8208;free state and reducing carrier recombination losses. Moreover, by integrating the self&#8208;cross&#8208;linking and intermolecular &#960;&#8208;effect, the application of BMA upgraded the internal capsulation from linear protection to a compact mesh&#8208;like scale. Consequently, the application of BMA not only boosted the efficiency to 25.31% but also greatly enhanced the stability of the perovskite layer, especially for water resistance and preventing lead linkage. The internal capsulation strategy upgrading from linear to mesh&#8208;like marked an innovative direction in protecting the perovskite layer, paving the way for more sustainable PerSCs in further application.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A natural silkworm silk exhibiting strength of &#8776;1.2 GPa, on par with spider silk, has been developed through the integration of carbon nanotube feeding and in situ forced reeling. This method significantly enhances the &#946;&#8208;sheet nanocrystal content and alignment within silk, resulting in notable mechanical improvements. This work presents a scalable and eco&#8208;friendly approach for producing high&#8208;strength natural fibers.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance silk fibers, with their eco&#8208;friendly degradability and renewability, have long captivated researchers as an alternative to synthetic fibers. Spider dragline silk, renowned for its exceptional strength (&gt;1 GPa), has an extremely low yield, hindering its widespread use. While domesticated silkworms (Bombyx mori) can produce silk fibers industrially, their moderate strength (&#8776;0.5 GPa) pales in comparison to the formidable spider dragline silk. In this study, naturally produced strong silkworm silk fibers are reported with a tensile strength of &#8776;1.2 GPa achieved through combining feeding carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to silkworms and in situ forced reeling for alignment. Molecular dynamics simulations confirm the interaction between the CNTs and silk fibroin, while the forced reeling process aligns these reinforcing fillers and the silk fibroin &#946;&#8208;sheet nanocrystals along the fiber axis. Structural analysis reveals a significant enhancement in the content and alignment of &#946;&#8208;sheet nanocrystals within the silk fibers, accounting for their superior mechanical properties, including tensile strength of &#8776;1.2 GPa and Young's modulus of 24.4 GPa, surpassing various types of silkworm silk and spider silk. This advancement addresses the historical trade&#8208;off between the strength and scalability of silk, potentially paving the way for eco&#8208;friendly, biodegradable, and renewable alternatives to synthetic fibers in a variety of applications.

         <title>Alicyclic Polyimide With Multiple Breakdown Self&#8208;Healing Based on Gas&#8208;Condensation Phase Validation for High Temperature Capacitive Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The alicyclic polyimide completely degrades during the electric breakdown process under a high electric field, a large number of gaseous products and resulting in a low residual carbon rate, thus achieving self&#8208;healing capability for multiple electrical breakdowns, making it a potential dielectric material for new&#8208;generation high&#8208;temperature film capacitors.








Abstract
Polymer dielectrics with combined thermal stability and self&#8208;healing properties are specifically desired for high&#8208;temperature film capacitors. The high thermal stability of conventional polymers benefits from the abundance of aromatic rings in the molecule backbone, but the high carbon content sacrifices their self&#8208;healing properties. Here, analicyclic polyimide with a high glass transition temperature (256&#160;&#176;C) and wide energy bandgap (4.58&#160;eV) is designed, which exhibits electric conductivity more than an order of magnitude lower than that of classical polyimide at high electric fields and high temperatures. As a result, alicyclic polyimide achieves a discharged energy density of 4.54 J&#160;cm&#8722;3 and a charge&#8208;discharge efficiency of above 90% at 200&#160;&#176;C, which is superior to existing dielectric polymers and composites. The alicyclic polyimide benefits from a low pyrolytic residual carbon rate, retaining 93% of the dielectric breakdown strength after four electrical breakdown cycles. Distinguishing from the current condensed&#8208;phase self&#8208;healing concept, for the first time, exploring the self&#8208;healing capability of high&#8208;temperature polyimide dielectric is presented based on dual self&#8208;healing mechanisms of gas&#8208;phase and condensed&#8208;phase. The high energy density at high temperatures and the superior self&#8208;healing capability of alicyclic polyimide further indicate the promise of polyimide dielectric film capacitors for extreme conditions.

         <title>Making Sticky&#8208;Slippery Switchable Fluorogels Through Self&#8208;Adaptive Bicontinuous Phase Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy employing self&#8208;adaptive bicontinuous phase separation is proposed to reversibly switch a copolymer fluorogel between extremely sticky and slippery states. At ambient temperature, a slippery surface is presented coated by a thin liquid lubricant layer. However, upon heating, the hydrogen bonds in the thermal&#8208;responsive phase partially dissociate, resulting in a highly sticky surface dominated by adhesive dangling chains.








Abstract
Developing gel materials with tunable frictional properties is crucial for applications in soft robotics, anti&#8208;fouling, and joint protection. However, achieving reversible switching between extreme sticky and slippery states remains a formidable challenge due to the opposing requirements for energy dissipation on gel surfaces. Herein, a self&#8208;adaptive bicontinuous fluorogel is introduced that decouples lubrication and adhesion at varying temperatures. The phase&#8208;separated fluorogel comprises a soft fluorinated lubricating phase and a stiff yet thermal&#8208;responsive load&#8208;bearing phase. At ambient temperature, the fluorogel exhibits a highly slippery surface owing to a low&#8208;energy&#8208;dissipating lubricating layer, demonstrating an ultralow friction coefficient of 0.004. Upon heating, the fluorogel transitions into a highly dissipating state via hydrogen bond dissociation, concurrently releasing adhesive dangling chains to make the surface highly sticky with an adhesion strength of &#8776;362&#160;kPa. This approach provides a promising foundation for creating advanced adaptive materials with on&#8208;demand self&#8208;adhesive and self&#8208;lubricating capabilities.

         <title>NADPH Oxidases&#8208;Inspired Reactive Oxygen Biocatalysts with Electron&#8208;Rich Pt Sites to Potently Amplify Immune Checkpoint Blockade Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NADPH oxidases&#8208;inspired reactive oxygen biocatalysts with electron&#8208;rich Pt sites are designed to potently amplify immune checkpoint blockade therapy. The synthesized Pt&#9472;WOx presents rapid electron transfer capability for superior reactive oxygen biocatalysis, which directly triggers endoplasmic reticulum stress, stimulates tumor&#8208;specific immune responses, and alleviates the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment potently for amplifying the anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1&#8208;based immune checkpoint blockade therapy.








Abstract
Clinical immune checkpoint blockade (ICB)&#8208;based immunotherapy of malignant tumors only elicits durable responses in a minority of patients, primarily due to the highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Although inducing immunogenic cell death (ICD) through reactive oxygen biocatalyst represents an attractive therapeutic strategy to amplify ICB, currently reported biocatalysts encounter insurmountable challenges in achieving high ROS&#8208;generating activity to induce potent ICD. Here, inspired by the natural catalytic characteristics of NADPH oxidases, the design of efficient, robust, and electron&#8208;rich Pt&#8208;based redox centers on the non&#8208;stoichiometric W18O49 substrates (Pt&#9472;WOx) to serve as bioinspired reactive oxygen biocatalysts to potently activate the ICD, which eventually enhance cancer immune responses and amplifies the ICB&#8208;based immunotherapy is reported. These studies demonstrate that the Pt&#9472;WOx exhibits rapid electron transfer capability and can promote the formation of electron&#8208;rich and low oxophilic Pt redox centers for superior reactive oxygen biocatalysis, which enables the Pt&#9472;WOx&#8208;based inducers to trigger endoplasmic reticulum stress directly and stimulate immune responses potently for amplifying the anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1&#8208;based ICB therapy. This bioinspired design provides a straightforward strategy to engineer efficient, robust, and electron&#8208;rich reactive oxygen biocatalysts and also opens up a new avenue to create efficient ICD inducers for primary/metastatic tumor treatments.

The defect chemistry is focused on governing high&#8208;voltage cathode materials for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The classifications, formation, and evolution mechanisms of defects are emphasized to explore the intricate relationship between defective structures and electrochemical behaviors.

Abstract
High&#8208;voltage cathodes (HVCs) have emerged as a paramount role for the next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, the pursuit of HVCs comes with inherent challenges related to defective structures, which significantly impact the electrochemical performance of LIBs. The current obstacle lies in the lack of a comprehensive understanding of defects and their precise effects. This perspective aims to provide insights into defect chemistry for governing HVCs. The classifications, formation mechanisms, and evolution of defects are outlined to explore the intricate relationship between defects and electrochemical behavior. The pressing need for cutting&#8208;edge characterization techniques that comprehensively investigate defects across various temporal and spatial scales is emphasized. Building on these fundamental understandings, engineering strategies such as composition tailoring, morphology design, interface modification, and structural control to mitigate or utilize defects are thoroughly discussed for enhanced HVCs performance. These insights are expected to provide vital guidelines for developing high&#8208;performance HVCs for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Tetrahydrofuran Processable Organic Solar Cells with 19.45% Efficiency Realized by Introducing High Molecular Dipole Unit Into the Terpolymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating dithienophthalimide unit with high dipole moment into PM6 main chain, endows the designed terpolymers with good tetrahydrofuran processability and enhanced crystallinity, resulting in high PCEs of 18.79% and 19.45% for tetrahydrofuran processable binary and ternary blend OSCs.








Abstract
Developing organic solar cells (OSCs) processable with halogen&#8208;free, non&#8208;aromatic solvents is crucial for practical applications, yet challenging due to the limited solubility of most photoactive materials. This study introduces high&#8208;performance terpolymers processable in tetrahydrofuran (THF) by incorporating dithienophthalimide (DPI) into the PM6 backbone. DPI extends the absorption band, lowers HOMO levels, and improves THF solubility and film crystallinity through its large dipole moment effect. Optimal PBD&#8208;10:L8&#8208;BO devices processed with THF achieved a competitive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.79%, approaching chloroform&#8208;processed devices (19.04%). By introducing PBTz&#8208;F as a second donor, ternary OSCs reached an impressive 19.45% PCE when processed with THF. This improvement stems from enhanced photon generation, improved morphology, better charge transport, longer exciton lifetimes, efficient charge dissociation and collection, and suppressed recombination. These PCEs of 18.79% and 19.45% for binary and ternary blend OSCs, respectively, represent the highest reported efficiencies for OSCs processed with halogen&#8208;free, non&#8208;aromatic solvents. This work demonstrates significant progress in eco&#8208;friendly OSC fabrication, paving the way for more sustainable and commercially viable organic photovoltaic technologies.

         <title>Achieving High Doping Density in pH&#8208;neutral Conjugated Polyelectrolyte Toward Effective Hole&#8208;Transporting Materials for Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of pH&#8208;neutral conjugated polyelectrolytes with high doping density are designed and synthesized as hole&#8208;transporting layer materials. The high doping density of PTT&#8208;F:POM is proved to significantly decrease the depletion region width at the anode interface, which minimized the energy loss in hole transport. Consequently, a binary organic solar cell modified by PTT&#8208;F:POM achieved a high PCE of 18.8%.








Abstract
The lack of effective and non&#8208;corrosive hole&#8208;transporting layer (HTL) materials has remained a long&#8208;standing issue that severely restricts the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). Most pH&#8208;neutral conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) exhibit inferior performance to the acid&#8208;doped HTL materials due to their low doping density. In this study, a series of pH&#8208;neutral CPEs is designed and synthesized with high doping density as HTL materials. Through an elaborate synthetic route, two sulfonate&#8208;terminating alkoxyl side chains can be introduced into thiophene, by which the electron&#8208;rich, highly soluble, and chemically stable thiophene monomer is synthesized to enable the subsequent polymerization. The CPE PTT&#8208;F exhibit a remarkable self&#8208;doping property with an enhanced doping density from 2.01 &#215; 1017 to 7.02 &#215; 1018 cm&#8722;3. The high work function and the increased doping density of PTT&#8208;F&#8208;based HTL decrease the depletion region width from 38.4 to 8.1&#160;nm at the anode interface, which minimized the energy loss in hole transport. Consequently, a binary OSC modified by PTT&#8208;F&#8208;based HTL achieve a high PCE of 18.8%. To the best of the knowledge, this is the highest PCE for OSC employing CPE&#8208;based HTL. The results from this work demonstrate an encouraging achievement of realizing exceptional hole collection ability in pH&#8208;neutral CPEs.

         <title>Engineering Hygroscopic MOF&#8208;Based Silk Via Bioinspired Interfacial Assembly for Fast Moisture Manipulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hygroscopic MOF&#8208;based silk is prepared by bioinspired interfacial assembly for fast moisture manipulation. The silk possesses high MOFs content and exhibits considerable water adsorption capacity and fast kinetics. Moreover, both joule heat and solar heat can be employed to release water owing to the excellent integrability of MOF&#8208;based silk, achieving diverse and efficient moisture applications.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as exceptional moisture sorbents in low humidity conditions. However, their typical powdered form often results in agglomeration, impeding water diffusion kinetics and practical handling. To enhance the accessibility and diversify the integration of MOFs, a universal and scalable bionic interfacial assembly method is introduced for fabricating MOF&#8208;based silk. The resulting silk, enriched with a high content of MOF&#8208;303, demonstrates a significant water adsorption capacity of 315.1 mg g&#8722;1 at 25% relative humidity, exhibiting a three fold faster water absorption compared with that of stacked MOFs powder on a gram&#8208;scale. Furthermore, it achieves efficient water release, with a rate of 8.1 mg g&#8722;1 min&#8722;1 under sunlight after surface photothermal modification. Through one&#8208;step drawing assembly, electrothermal wires can be incorporated into MOF&#8208;based silk and demonstrate fast and reversible moisture adsorption/desorption for indoor humidity control. It is envisioned that this assembling method and integrated functional silk will yield valuable insights into the rational engineering of MOFs toward practical applications in moisture management, molecule absorption, etc.

This review highlights the roles of micro&#8208; and nanoscale materials in cell engineering, demonstrating how they can be adaptively controlled to regulate cellular reprogramming and core cell&#8208;level functions.








Abstract
Customizable manufacturing of ex vivo cell engineering is driven by the need for innovations in the biomedical field and holds substantial potential for addressing current therapeutic challenges; but it is still only in its infancy. Micro&#8208; and nanoscale&#8208;engineered materials are increasingly used to control core cell&#8208;level functions in cellular engineering. By reprogramming or redirecting targeted cells for extremely precise functions, these advanced materials offer new possibilities. This influences the modularity of cell reprogramming and reengineering, making these materials part of versatile and emerging technologies. Here, the roles of micro&#8208; and nanoscale materials in cell engineering are highlighted, demonstrating how they can be adaptively controlled to regulate cellular reprogramming and core cell&#8208;level functions, including differentiation, proliferation, adhesion, user&#8208;defined gene expression, and epigenetic changes. The current reprogramming routes used to achieve pluripotency from somatic cells and the significant potential of induced pluripotent stem cell technology for translational biomedical research are covered. Recent advances in nonviral intracellular delivery modalities for cell reprogramming and their constraints are evaluated. This paper focuses on emerging physical and combinatorial approaches of intracellular delivery for cell engineering, revealing the capabilities and limitations of these routes. It is showcased how these programmable materials are continually being explored as customizable tools for inducing biophysical stimulation. Harnessing the power of micro&#8208; and nanoscale&#8208;engineered materials will be a step change in the design of cell engineering, producing a suite of powerful tools for addressing potential future challenges in therapeutic cell engineering.

         <title>Empowering the Sustainable Development of High&#8208;End Alloys via Interpretive Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An alternative design strategy for determining alloying&#8208;element contents based on game theory and operations research theory is proposed to effectively substitute scarce alloying elements with abundant ones. Cu&#8208;1.95Ni&#8208;0.5Co&#8208;0.6Si&#8208;0.2Mg&#8208;0.1Cr, an alloy with an ultra&#8208;low Co content (64% lower than that of the C70350 alloy) is developed and exhibited properties comparable to those of the original alloy.








Abstract
The extensive use of scarce, expensive, and toxic elements in high&#8208;performance metal alloys restricts their sustainable development. Here we propose a novel alternative alloying&#8208;element design strategy that combines physicochemical&#8208;factor screening, a &#8220;black&#8208;box&#8221; interpretative method based on SHapley Additive exPlanation analysis, and sensitivity analyses of elemental influence. A &#8220;white&#8208;box&#8221; model of alloy compositions and properties is therefore established that enables the rational selection of abundant elements and the efficient designs of alloys with substitution for scarce alloying elements. The success of this design strategy is demonstrated by reducing the Co content in the C70350 alloy series (e.g., Cu&#8208;1.3Ni&#8208;1.4Co&#8208;0.56Si&#8208;0.03Mg (wt.%)). Indeed, Cu&#8208;1.95Ni&#8208;0.5Co&#8208;0.6Si&#8208;0.2Mg&#8208;0.1Cr (wt.%) is obtained as an ultra&#8208;low&#8208;Co&#8208;containing alloy by substituting only a trace amount of Cr for Co in the Cu&#8208;Ni&#8208;Co&#8208;Si&#8208;Mg system, followed by compositional optimization. Although the Co content is reduced by 64% (i.e., from 1.4 to 0.5 wt.%), the properties of the alloy (ultimate tensile strength and electrical conductivity of 850&#160;MPa and 47.2%IACS, respectively) are comparable to those of the C70350 alloy. This study contributes to the sustainable and green development of metallic materials by providing a new avenue for substituting abundant elements for scarce and undesired elements in metal alloys.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extensive use of scarce, expensive, and toxic elements in high-performance metal alloys restricts their sustainable development. Here we propose a novel alternative alloying-element design strategy that combines physicochemical-factor screening, a &#8220;black-box&#8221; interpretative method based on SHapley Additive exPlanation analysis, and sensitivity analyses of elemental influence. A &#8220;white-box&#8221; model of alloy compositions and properties is therefore established that enables the rational selection of abundant elements and the efficient designs of alloys with substitution for scarce alloying elements. The success of this design strategy is demonstrated by reducing the Co content in the C70350 alloy series (e.g., Cu-1.3Ni-1.4Co-0.56Si-0.03Mg (wt.%)). Indeed, Cu-1.95Ni-0.5Co-0.6Si-0.2Mg-0.1Cr (wt.%) is obtained as an ultra-low-Co-containing alloy by substituting only a trace amount of Cr for Co in the Cu-Ni-Co-Si-Mg system, followed by compositional optimization. Although the Co content is reduced by 64% (i.e., from 1.4 to 0.5 wt.%), the properties of the alloy (ultimate tensile strength and electrical conductivity of 850&#160;MPa and 47.2%IACS, respectively) are comparable to those of the C70350 alloy. This study contributes to the sustainable and green development of metallic materials by providing a new avenue for substituting abundant elements for scarce and undesired elements in metal alloys.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hierarchical Nanostructures as Acoustically Manipulatable Multifunctional Agents in Dynamic Fluid Flow</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flower&#8208;like hierarchical nanostructure microparticles can be trapped by focused ultrasound and manipulated within high&#8208;velocity dynamic fluid flow. The wide range of design versatility, substantial surface area, and biocompatibility enable such microparticles to function as acoustically manipulatable medical imaging contrast agents and microrobots.








Abstract
Acoustic waves provide a biocompatible and deep&#8208;tissue&#8208;penetrating tool suitable for contactless manipulation in in vivo environments. Despite the prevalence of dynamic fluids within the body, previous studies have primarily focused on static fluids, and manipulatable agents in dynamic fluids are limited to gaseous core&#8208;shell particles. However, these gas&#8208;filled particles face challenges in fast&#8208;flow manipulation, complex setups, design versatility, and practical medical imaging, underscoring the need for effective alternatives. In this study, flower&#8208;like hierarchical nanostructures (HNS) into microparticles (MPs) are incorporated, and demonstrated that various materials fabricated as HNS&#8208;MPs exhibit effective and reproducible acoustic trapping within high&#8208;velocity fluid flows. Through simulations, it is validated that the HNS&#8208;MPs are drawn to the focal point by acoustic streaming and form a trap through secondary acoustic streaming at the tips of the nanosheets comprising the HNS&#8208;MPs. Furthermore, the wide range of materials and modification options for HNS, combined with their high surface area and biocompatibility, enable them to serve as acoustically manipulatable multimodal imaging contrast agents and microrobots. They can perform intravascular multi&#8208;trap maneuvering with real&#8208;time imaging, purification of wastewater flow, and highly&#8208;loaded drug delivery. Given the diverse HNS materials developed to date, this study extends their applications to acoustofluidic and biomedical fields.

         <title>Achieving the 1D Atomic Chain Limit in Van der Waals Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, the ability to exfoliate and process two representative van der Waals materials containing 1D motifs, namely MoI3 and Ta2Se8I, at the scale of individual atomic chains is demonstrated. For MoI3, it is observed that chains are the suspended and substrate&#8208;supported samples. For Ta2Se8I, processing capabilities with electron beams to achieve suspended individual atomic chains are shown.








Abstract
Experiments with graphene have demonstrated that 2D van der Waals materials can be stable, robust, and efficiently manipulated at the level of individual atomic planes. However, the stability and manipulation of 1D van der Waals materials and individual atomic chains remains elusive. Here, the ability to exfoliate and process two representative van der Waals materials containing 1D motifs, namely MoI3 and Ta2Se8I, at the scale of individual atomic chains is demonstrated. High&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy studies confirm the presence of stable individual atomic chains of MoI3 at room temperature. It is further shown that 1D van der Waals materials with low exfoliation energy, such as Ta2Se8I, can be processed with electron beams to achieve suspended individual atomic chains. Ab initio calculations corroborate the findings regarding the cleavage energies and the thermodynamic stability of individual atomic chains in these 1D van der Waals materials. These results demonstrate that the top&#8208;down approach in material processing can be extended to the scale of individual chains.

         <title>Modulating the Electronic Structure of MnNi2S3 Nanoelectrodes to Activate Pyroptosis for Electrocatalytic Hydrogen&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Manganese&#8208;doped Ni2S3 nanoelectrodes are designed for the electrocatalytic delivery of H2 and the activation of antitumor immunity to effectively potentiate H2&#8208;immunotherapy. This work demonstrates an electrocatalyst with high hydrogen evolution reaction activity for synergistic gas&#8208;immunotherapy, which may spark electrocatalyst&#8208;based tumor therapy strategies.








Abstract
Hydrogen (H2) therapy has demonstrated antitumor effect, but the therapeutic efficacy is restricted by the low solubility and nontarget delivery of H2. Electrolysis of H2O by electrocatalysts sustainably releases enormous amounts of H2 and inspires the precise delivery of H2 for tumor therapy. Herein, manganese&#8208;doped Ni2S3 nanoelectrodes (MnNi2S3 NEs) are designed for the electrocatalytic delivery of H2 and the activation of antitumor immunity to effectively potentiate H2&#8208;immunotherapy. Ni atoms featuring empty 3d orbitals reduce the initial energy barrier of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) by promoting the adsorption of H2O. Moreover, Mn atoms with different electronegativity modulate the electronic structure of Ni atoms and facilitate the desorption of the generated H2, thus enhancing the HER activity of the MnNi2S3 NEs. Based on the high HER activity, controllable delivery of H2 for electrocatalytic hydrogen therapy (EHT) is achieved in a voltage&#8208;dependent manner. Mechanistically, MnNi2S3 NE&#8208;mediated EHT induces mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, which subsequently activates pyroptosis through the typical ROS/caspase&#8208;1/GSDMD signaling pathway. Furthermore, MnNi2S3 NE&#8208;mediated EHT enhances the infiltration of CD8+ T lymphocytes into tumors and reverses the immunosuppressive microenvironment. This work demonstrates an electrocatalyst with high HER activity for synergistic gas&#8208;immunotherapy, which may spark electrocatalyst&#8208;based tumor therapy strategies.

         <title>Embedding Reverse Electron Transfer Between Stably Bare Cu Nanoparticles and Cation&#8208;Vacancy CuWO4</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An embedded cation&#8208;vacancy metal&#8208;oxide interface is developed to induce the reverse strong metal&#8208;support interactions in Cu NPs, which inhibits its surface oxidation in ambient air, high&#8208;temperature agglomeration, and CO poisoning adsorption. In contrast to the Langmuir&#8208;Hinshelwood mechanism observed in the deposited Cu NPs, the exsolved electron&#8208;enriched Cu NPs with anion oxygen protective layers follow the Eley&#8208;Rideal mechanism during CO oxidation.








Abstract
Cu nanoparticles (NPs) have attracted widespread attention in electronics, energy, and catalysis. However, conventionally synthesized Cu NPs face some challenges such as surface passivation and agglomeration in applications, which impairs their functionalities in the physicochemical properties. Here, the issues above by engineering an embedded interface of stably bare Cu NPs on the cation&#8208;vacancy CuWO4 support is addressed, which induces the strong metal&#8208;support interactions and reverse electron transfer. Various atomic&#8208;scale analyses directly demonstrate the unique electronic structure of the embedded Cu NPs with negative charge and anion oxygen protective layer, which mitigates the typical degradation pathways such as oxidation in ambient air, high&#8208;temperature agglomeration, and CO poisoning adsorption. Kinetics and in situ spectroscopic studies unveil that the embedded electron&#8208;enriched Cu NPs follow the typical Eley&#8208;Rideal mechanism in CO oxidation, contrasting the Langmuir&#8208;Hinshelwood mechanism on the traditional Cu NPs. This mechanistic shift is driven by the Coulombic repulsion in anion oxygen layer, enabling its direct reaction with gaseous CO to form the easily desorbed monodentate carbonate.

         <title>Laser&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Limiting Welding of Ag Nanowires with High Mechanical and Electrical Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a systematic analysis of the mechanism and influencing factors of the local energy enhancement regulation of Ag nanowires and their joints under laser induction, a self&#8208;limiting joint of Ag nanowires with mechanical/electrical properties equivalent to those of the base material is obtained.








Abstract
The high&#8208;efficiency and high&#8208;precision welding technology of Ag nanowires is of great engineering significance for the integration of new&#8208;generation micro&#8208; and nanodevices, and the mechanical behavior of its interconnect joints is also essential for their reliable application, especially for some flexible device. In this paper, based on the nano&#8208;focusing and localized plasma enhancement properties of Ag nanowires under laser irradiation, Ag nanowire self&#8208;limiting joints with mechanical and electrical properties comparable to those of the base material are obtained. At the same time, the local plasma enhancement characteristics of Ag nanowire joints are scanned and analyzed with nanoscale resolution by using cathodoluminescence technology, and the local multi&#8208;physical field coupling regulation mechanism of Ag nanowire joints induced by different laser parameters is systematically investigated by combining theoretical simulations. Meanwhile, based on the in situ laser welding and nanomechanical tensile experiments, the mechanical properties of single Ag nanowires and their welded joints are systematically analyzed, and the characteristics of the interfacial atomic behaviors and the evolution process during the welding and tensile processes are investigated.

         <title>Gradient and De&#8208;Clustered Anionic Redox Enabled Undetectable O2 Formation in 4.5&#160;V Sodium Manganese Oxide Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Na7/9[Li1/9Ni1/9Mg1/9Mn6/9]O2 cathode which possesses multiple redox centers and diversified superstructure units is designed. Due to the gradient redox activity and de&#8208;clustered spatial distribution of oxygen ions, the O2 formation accompanying anionic redox is not detectable. Further, a thermodynamic and kinetic perspective for achieving stable oxygen lattice via avoiding oxygens over&#8208;oxidation and stress concentration is proposed.








Abstract
Anionic redox chemistry presents a promising approach to enhancing the energy density of oxide cathode materials. However, anionic redox reactions invariably lead to O2 formation, either as free gaseous O2 or trapped molecular O2, which destabilizes the material's structure. Here, this critical challenge is addressed by constructing a crystal structure with both gradient redox activity and de&#8208;clustered redox&#8208;active oxygen. This design strategy is directly validated by operando differential electrochemical mass spectrometry and ex situ 50&#160;K electron paramagnetic resonance, revealing no release of O2 or trapped O2 in the 4.5&#160;V P2&#8208;type sodium manganese&#8208;based layered oxide. Notably, the material exhibits a highly reversible capacity of 247&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 at 20&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1 and exceptional capacity retention of 91.4% after 300 cycles at 300&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1. In situ X&#8208;ray diffraction further suggests that the absence of O2 formation suppresses the typical P2&#8208;O2 phase transition, resulting in a minimal lattice volume change of only 0.5%. Ex situ neutron diffraction studies and theoretical calculations further elucidate that the locally ordered lattice is well&#8208;preserved, attributable to reduced cationic migrations during cycling.

         <title>Elaborated Bio&#8208;Heterojunction With Robust Sterilization Effect for Infected Tissue Regeneration via Activating Competent Cell&#8208;Like Antibacterial Tactic</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel antibacterial strategy is proposed by activating competent cell&#8208;like state of pathogenic bacteria, the membranes of bacteria are attacked by Ca2+ and the permeability significantly gets promoted, which makes them easily destroyed by the ROS and heat generated by the fabricated MC bio&#8208;HJs, finally achieving a rapid and efficient antibacterial effect.








Abstract
Phototherapy, such as photothermal therapy (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been a powerful strategy to combat bacterial infection. However, the compact cell membranes of pathogenic bacteria, especially drug&#8208;resistant bacteria, significantly diminish the efficiency of heat conduction and impede the entrance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) into cells, resulting in unsatisfactory sterilization. Enlightened by the membrane feature of competent bacteria, herein a MXene/CaO2 bio&#8208;heterojunction (MC bio&#8208;HJ) is elaborated to achieve rapid disinfection and promote infected tissue regeneration through activating competent cell&#8208;like antibacterial tactics. The bio&#8208;HJ first compels pathogenic bacteria to become a competent cell&#8208;like stage through the coordination of Ca2+ and membrane phospholipid, and potentiates the membrane permeability. Assisted by near infrared (NIR) irradiation, the heat and ROS generated from PTT and PDT of bio&#8208;HJ easily pass through bacterial membrane and drastically perturb bacterial metabolism, leading to rapid disinfection. More importantly, employing two in vivo infected model of mice, it have corroborated that the MC bio&#8208;HJs not only effectively accelerate MRSA&#8208;infected cutaneous regeneration, but also considerably boost osseointegration in an infected bone defect after coating on orthopedic implants. As envisaged, this work demonstrates a novel therapeutic tactic with robust antibacterial effect to remedy infected tissue regeneration through activating competent cell&#8208;like stage.

This review summarizes recent advances in the three&#8208;dimensional (3D) printing of conductive microstructures via two&#8208;photon polymerization, focusing on essential criteria and preparation strategies of photoresists, and offering strategic recommendations to enhance 3D conductive microstructure construction.








Abstract
The advancement of electronic devices necessitates the development of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) high&#8208;precision conductive microstructures, which have extensive applications in bio&#8208;electronic interfaces, soft robots, and electronic skins. Two&#8208;photon polymerization (TPP) based 3D printing is a critical technique that offers unparalleled fabrication resolution in 3D space for intricate conductive structures. While substantial progress has been made in this field, this review summarizes recent advances in the 3D printing of conductive microstructures via TPP, mainly focusing on the essential criteria of photoresist resins suitable for TPP. Further preparation strategies of these photoresists and methods for constructing 3D conductive microstructures via TPP are discussed. The application prospects of 3D conductive microstructures in various fields are discussed, highlighting the imperative to advance their additive manufacturing technology. Finally, strategic recommendations are offered to enhance the construction of 3D conductive microstructures using TPP, addressing prevailing challenges and fostering significant advancements in manufacturing technology.

         <title>Fine&#8208;Tuning the d&#8208;Band Center Position of Zinc to Increase the Anti&#8208;Tumor Activity of Single&#8208;Atom Nanozymes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrated that B doping can effectively modulate the fully occupied 3d10 electron configuration of Zn. The formed Zn&#9472;N&#9472;B bonds redistributed the charge of Zn and moved the d&#8208;band center (Ed) of Zn closer to the fermi level (Ef), which significantly promote the enzyme&#8208;like activities and anti&#8208;tumor catalytic therapy performance of Zn&#8208;SAs@BNC1000.








Abstract
The exceptional biocompatibility of Zn&#8208;based single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) has led to extensive research in their application for disease diagnosis and treatment. However, the fully occupied 3d10 electron configuration has seriously hampered the enzymatic&#8208;like activity of Zn&#8208;based SAzymes. Herein, a B&#8208;doped Zn&#8208;based SAzymes is fabricated by carbonizing zeolite&#8208;like Zn&#8208;based boron imidazolate framework at different temperatures (Zn&#8208;SAs@BNCx, x = 800, 900, 1000, and 1100&#160;&#176;C). The formed B&#9472;N bond yielded a local electric field, which changes the position of the d&#8208;band center and improved the oxidation state of Zn by facilitating the electron transfer from Zn to N to B. These changes enhanced the adsorption and activation of H2O2 and O2 by Zn&#8208;SAs@BNC1000, increasing the nanozymes&#8217; multi&#8208;enzyme catalytic activity. B doping led to 24.81&#8208;, 32.37&#8208;, and 13.98&#8208;fold increase in the peroxidase&#8208;, oxidase&#8208; and catalase&#8208;like, respectively, catalytic efficiency (Kcat/Km) of Zn&#8208;SAs@BNC1000 when compared with no B doping. In addition, Zn&#8208;SAs@BNC1000 showed excellent ability to kill tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo. This study demonstrates that the modulation of the electron configuration of Zn is an effective strategy to develop efficient anti&#8208;tumor approaches by boosting the enzymatic activity of Zn&#8208;based SAzymes.

&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;/&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;) of Zn-SAs@BNC&lt;sub&gt;1000&lt;/sub&gt; when compared with no B doping. In addition, Zn-SAs@BNC&lt;sub&gt;1000&lt;/sub&gt; showed excellent ability to kill tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo. This study demonstrates that the modulation of the electron configuration of Zn is an effective strategy to develop efficient anti-tumor approaches by boosting the enzymatic activity of Zn-based SAzymes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Novel Super&#8208;Toughness and Self&#8208;Healing Solid Polymer Electrolyte for Solid Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a polyethylene oxide&#8208;based polymer electrolyte is prepared with liquid metal (GaInSn) nanoparticles (PEO@LM). The as&#8208;prepared PEO@LM electrolyte exhibits high tensile elongation and Young's modulus. And the liquid metal nanoparticles can move back and forth in SPEs driven by the electric field, which endows the interface between the solid electrolyte and the anode with self&#8208;healing properties and superior cycling stability.








Abstract
Solid sodium metal batteries (SSMBs) offer an alternative promising power source for electrochemical energy storage due to their high energy density and high safety. However, the inherent sodium dendrite growth and poor mechanical properties of electrolytes seriously limit their application. Herein, a network structure composed of polyethylene oxide&#8208;based composite polymer electrolyte (CPE) is designed with liquid metal nanoparticles (LM) for SSMBs, in which LM can move in the solid electrolyte with the electric field driven. This effect can facilitate the inactivated sodium return to the metal sodium anode, and alloy with dendrites at the same time, which is beneficial for inhibiting the growth of dendrites. The symmetric cell with the CPE containing LM achieves good cyclic stability of more than 1800 and 800&#160;h at 0.1 and 0.2&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, respectively. The energy density of the pouch battery can reach 230&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1. In sum, LM presents great potential to be employed as a performance reinforcement filler for CPEs, which paves the way for achieving high&#8208;performance SSMBs.

         <title>Constructing Electron&#8208;Rich Ru Clusters on Non&#8208;Stoichiometric Copper Hydroxide for Superior Biocatalytic ROS Scavenging to Treat Inflammatory Spinal Cord Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron&#8208;rich Ru clusters on non&#8208;stoichiometric copper hydroxide (Ru/def&#8208;Cu(OH)2) are synthesized as an effective biocatalytic reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger to suppress inflammation and promote recovery from spinal cord injury (SCI). Ru/def&#8208;Cu(OH)2 can mitigate ROS&#8208;mediated neuronal death and create a reparative microenvironment by suppressing inflammatory macrophage responses while promoting&#160;the activity of neural stem cells, anti&#8208;inflammatory macrophages, and oligodendrocytes.








Abstract
Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) represents a complex neuropathological challenge that significantly impacts the well&#8208;being of affected individuals. The quest for efficacious antioxidant and anti&#8208;inflammatory therapies is both a compelling necessity and a formidable challenge. Here, in this work, the innovative synthesis of electron&#8208;rich Ru clusters on non&#8208;stoichiometric copper hydroxide that contain oxygen vacancy defects (Ru/def&#8208;Cu(OH)2), which can function as a biocatalytic reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger for efficiently suppressing the inflammatory cascade reactions and modulating the endogenous microenvironments in SCI, is introduced. The studies reveal that the unique oxygen vacancies promote electron redistribution and amplify electron accumulation at Ru clusters, thus enhancing the catalytic activity of Ru/def&#8208;Cu(OH)2 in multielectron reactions involving oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates. These advancements endow the Ru/def&#8208;Cu(OH)2 with the capacity to mitigate ROS&#8208;mediated neuronal death and to foster a reparative microenvironment by dampening inflammatory macrophage responses, meanwhile concurrently stimulating the activity of neural stem cells, anti&#8208;inflammatory macrophages, and oligodendrocytes. Consequently, this results in a robust reparative effect on traumatic SCI. It is posited that the synthesized Ru/def&#8208;Cu(OH)2 exhibits unprecedented biocatalytic properties, offering a promising strategy to develop ROS&#8208;scavenging and anti&#8208;inflammatory materials for the management of traumatic SCI and a spectrum of other diseases associated with oxidative stress.

         <title>Enhancing Long Stability of Solid&#8208;State Batteries Through High&#8208;Energy Ball Milling&#8208;Induced Decomposition of Sulfide&#8208;Based Electrolyte to Sulfur</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing the high&#8208;energy ball milling technique, this work promotes the deposition of sulfide&#8208;based electrolyte onto sulfur, resulting in higher charge capacities than discharge capacities and surpass theoretical limits of metal sulfides. The chormium sulfid&#160;based solid state battery demonstrates specific capacity &gt;1200 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 with a capacity retention of over 80% after 650 cycles, maintaining cycling stability &gt; 1900 cycles.








Abstract
Metal sulfides are increasingly favored as cathode materials in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) due to their high energy density, stability, affordability, and conductivity. Metal sulfides often exhibit capacities exceeding their theoretical limits, a phenomenon that remains not fully understood. In this study, it reveals that this phenomenon is primarily due to the sulfur decomposition from sulfide&#8208;based electrolyte. By employing the high&#8208;energy ball milling (HEBM) technique, the deposition of sulfide&#8208;based electrolyte onto sulfur is intentionally promoted, resulting in higher charge capacities compared to the discharge capacities and surpass theoretical limits of metal sulfides. Using chromium sulfide (Cr2S3) as the active material, the sulfur decomposed from sulfide&#8208;based electrolyte transforms into lithium sulfide (Li2S) after discharge, resulting in an increased capacity by &#8776;439.6 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 and improved cycling stability. Consequently, it demonstrates a specific capacity surpassing 1200 mAh g&#8722;1 with a capacity retention of over 80% after 650 cycles, maintaining cycling stability for more than 1900 cycles and achieving a Coulombic efficiency exceeding 99.9%. This versatile HEBM approach enables the fabrication of ASSBs utilizing various transition metal sulfides, such as molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), niobium disulfide (NbS2), and iron disulfide (FeS2), all exhibiting over theoretical limited capacities and prolonged cycling capabilities.

         <dc:description>
&#946;&#8208;poly(1,1&#8208;difluoroethylene) as a ferroelectric polymer dipole is introduced into Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite to enhance the built&#8208;in electric field and promote the charge transfer at perovskite/electron transport layer interface, which effectively suppresses non&#8208;radiative recombination and reduces the interfacial quasi&#8208;Fermi Level Splitting deficit. The resultant Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite solar cells achieve a champion efficiency of 23.44%, along with enhanced long&#8208;term stability.








Abstract
The quasi&#8208;Fermi level splitting (QFLS) deficit caused by the non&#8208;radiative recombination at the interface of perovskite/electron transport layer (ETL) can lead to severe open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) loss and thus decreases the efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), however, has received limited attention in inverted tin&#8208;lead PSCs. Herein, the strategy of constructing an extra&#8208;electric field is presented by introducing ferroelectric polymer dipoles (FPD)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;poly(1,1&#8208;difluoroethylene)&#8208;to suppress the QFLS deficit. The directional polarization of FPD can enhance the built&#8208;in electric field (BEF) and thus promote the charge transfer at the perovskite/ETL interface, which effectively suppresses non&#8208;radiative recombination. Furthermore, the incorporation of FPD facilitates high&#8208;quality crystallization of perovskite and reduces the surface energetic disorder. Therefore, the QFLS deficit in the perovskite/ETL half&#8208;stacked device is reduced from 62 to 27 meV after incorporating FPD, and the optimized device achieves an efficiency of 23.44% with a high VOC of 0.88&#160;V. Additionally, the addition of FPD increases the activation energy for ion migration, which can reduce the effect of ion migration on the long&#8208;term stability of the device. Consequently, the FPD&#8208;incorporated device retains 88% of the initial efficiency after 1100&#160;h of continuous illumination at the maximum power point (MPP).

         <title>The Combination of a Donor&#8211;Acceptor TADF and a MR&#8208;TADF Emitting Core Results in Outstanding Electroluminescence Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ToC illustrates the molecular structure of DtCzBN&#8208;CNBT2 along with a brief overview of the performance of the corresponding OLED. The green and blue&#8208;colored moieties represent the MR&#8208;TADF emitting core and the pendant D&#8211;A TADF shield, respectively.








Abstract
Here the utility and potential of an emitter design are demonstrated, consisting of a narrowband&#8208;emitting multiresonant thermally activated delayed fluorescent (MR&#8208;TADF) core that is decorated with a suitably higher energy donor&#8208;acceptor TADF moiety. Not only does this D&#8211;A TADF group offer additional channels for triplet exciton harvesting and confers faster reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) kinetics but it also acts as a steric shield, insulating the emissive MR&#8208;TADF core from aggregation&#8208;caused quenching. Two emitters, DtCzBN&#8208;CNBT1 and DtCzBN&#8208;CNBT2, demonstrate enhanced photophysical properties leading to outstanding performance of the organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). DtCzBN&#8208;CNBT2, containing a D&#8211;A TADF moiety, has a faster kRISC (1.1&#160;&#215;&#160;105 s&#8722;1) and higher photoluminescence quantum yield (&#934;PL: 97%) compared to DtCzBN&#8208;CNBT1 (0.2&#160;&#215;&#160;105 s&#8722;1, &#934;PL: 90%), which contains a D&#8211;A moiety that itself is not TADF. The sensitizer&#8208;free OLEDs with DtCzBN&#8208;CNBT2 achieve a record&#8208;high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 40.2% and showed milder efficiency roll&#8208;off (EQE1000 of 20.7%) compared to the DtCzBN&#8208;CNBT1&#8208;based devices (EQEmax of 37.1% and EQE1000 of 11.9%).

         <title>Catalyst Design and Engineering for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Formic Acid Electrosynthesis for a Low&#8208;Carbon Economy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical CO2 reduction to formic acid using low&#8208;carbon electricity presents a promising pathway to produce an H2 energy carrier with minimal fugitive hydrogen emissions. However, for this process to become scalable, the development of highly stable and selective catalysts is essential. This article reviews and examines catalyst engineering approaches aimed at enabling economically viable solutions.








Abstract
Formic acid (FA) has emerged as a promising candidate for hydrogen energy storage due to its favorable properties such as low toxicity, low flammability, and high volumetric hydrogen storage capacity under ambient conditions. Recent analyses have suggested that FA produced by electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction reaction (eCO2RR) using low&#8208;carbon electricity exhibits lower fugitive hydrogen (H2) emissions and global warming potential (GWP) during the H2 carrier production, storage and transportation processes compared to those of other alternatives like methanol, methylcyclohexane, and ammonia. eCO2RR to FA can enable industrially relevant current densities without the need for high pressures, high temperatures, or auxiliary hydrogen sources. However, the widespread implementation of eCO2RR to FA is hindered by the requirement for highly stable and selective catalysts. Herein, the aim is to explore and evaluate the potential of catalyst engineering in designing stable and selective nanostructured catalysts that can facilitate economically viable production of FA.

         <title>Uniform Phase Permutation of Efficient Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Perovskite Solar Cells via Binary Spacers and Single Crystal Coordination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing the FA derivative PFA cation and BA2MA4Pb5I16 single crystals, the 2D perovskite film exhibits a long carrier lifetime, a low exciton binding energy, and an orderly stepped&#8208;type arrangement between different n phases, greatly improving the carrier transport performance. Based on this strategy, an excellent VOC of 1.26&#160;V and a recorded PCE of 21.15% in solar cells are achieved.








Abstract
2D Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper perovskites (RPPs) have attracted extensive attention in recent years due to their excellent environmental stability. However, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of RPP solar cells is much lower than that of 3D perovskite solar cells (PSCs), mainly attributed to their poor carrier transport performance and excessive heterogeneous phases. Herein, the binary spacers (n&#8208;butylammonium, BA and benzamidine, PFA) are introduced to regulate the crystallization kinetics and n&#8208;value phase distribution to form uniform phase permutation of RPP films. The study then incorporates n = 5 BA2MA4Pb5I16 memory single crystal to achieve ultrafast stepped&#8208;type carrier transport from the low n&#8208;value phases to the high n&#8208;value phases in the high&#8208;quality (BA0.75PFA0.25)2MA4Pb5I16 films. These binary spacers and single&#8208;crystal&#8208;assisted crystallization strategies produce high&#8208;quality films, leading to fast carrier extraction and significant nonradiative recombination suppression. The resulting PSC presents a champion PCE of 21.15% with an impressive open circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.26&#160;V, which is the record high efficiency and VOC for low n&#8208;value RPP solar cells (n &#8804; 5).

         <title>Removal&#8208;Free and Multicellular Suspension Bath&#8208;Based 3D Bioprinting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a storable and biocompatible starch hydrogel with a simple preparation procedure and a stable microgranule to scale up a range of hydrogels for removal&#8208;free and multicellular suspension bath&#8208;based 3D bioprinting. The mechanism of the starch hydrogel suspension bath is described. The starch hydrogel enables a variety of printing applications, high&#8208;precision manufacturing, and multicellular structures.








Abstract
Suspension bath&#8208;based 3D bioprinting (SUB3BP) is effective in creating engineered vascular structures. The transfer of oxygen and nutrients via engineered vascular networks is necessary for tissue or organ survival and integration following transplantation. Existing SUB3BP techniques face challenges in fabricating hierarchical structures with multicellular organization, including issues related to suspension bath removal, restricted material choices, and low accuracy. A next&#8208;generation SUB3BP technique that is removal&#8208;free and multicellular is presented. A simple, storable, stable, and scalable starch hydrogel design leverages the diverse spectrum of hydrogels available for use in SUB3BP. Starch granules (8.1&#160;&#181;m) create vascular structures with minimal surface roughness (2.5&#160;&#181;m) that simulate more natural vessel walls compared to prior research. The development of cells and organoids, as well as the bioprinting of multicellular skin models with vasculature, demonstrates that starch suspension baths eliminate the removal process and have the potential for fabricating artificial tissue with a hierarchical structure and multicellular distribution.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple method for fabricating 3D&#8208;printed soft biomaterials infused with carbon dots, resulting in a flexible, energy&#8208;independent system with bactericidal, antioxidant, and mechano&#8208;optical sensitivity.








Abstract
Cephalopods use stretchy skin and dynamic color&#8208;tuning organs for visual communication and camouflage.

         <title>All&#8208;Epitaxial Self&#8208;Assembly of Silicon Color Centers Confined Within Sub&#8208;Nanometer Thin Layers Using Ultra&#8208;Low Temperature Epitaxy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;state color center emitter formation by ion implantation has the drawback that emitter positions below the surface cannot be deterministically controlled on the nanoscale. Here, this bottleneck can be overcome by a fabrication scheme that departs from ion implantation and only uses epitaxial self&#8208;assembly of color centers. Their formation can be controlled in layers as thin as one lattice constant.








Abstract
Silicon&#8208;based color&#8208;centers (SiCCs) have recently emerged as quantum&#8208;light sources that can be combined with telecom&#8208;range Si Photonics platforms. Unfortunately, using conventional SiCC fabrication schemes, deterministic control over the vertical emitter position is impossible due to the stochastic nature of the required ion&#8208;implantation(s). To overcome this bottleneck toward high&#8208;yield integration, a radically innovative creation method is demonstrated for various SiCCs with excellent optical quality, solely relying on the epitaxial growth of Si and C&#8208;doped Si at atypically&#8208;low temperatures in an ultra&#8208;clean growth environment. These telecom emitters can be confined within sub&#8208;nm thick epilayers embedded within a highly crystalline Si matrix at arbitrary vertical positions. Tuning growth conditions and doping, different well&#8208;known SiCC types can be selectively created, including W&#8208;centers, T&#8208;centers, G&#8208;centers, and, especially, a so far unidentified derivative of the latter, introduced as G&#8242;&#8208;center. The zero&#8208;phonon emission from G&#8242;&#8208;centers at &#8776;1300&#160;nm can be conveniently tuned by the C&#8208;concentration, leading to a systematic wavelength shift and linewidth narrowing toward low emitter densities, which makes both, the epitaxy&#8208;based fabrication and the G&#8242;&#8208;center particularly promising as integrable Si&#8208;based single&#8208;photon sources and spin&#8208;photon interfaces.

         <title>3D Polymeric Lattice Microstructure&#8208;Based Microneedle Array for Transdermal Electrochemical Biosensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MNAs are used to construct a transdermal electrochemical biosensing platform for health monitoring and diagnostics. Microneedles are fabricated using a combination of a soft lithography process and 3D printing technology based on a direct laser lithography system that uses two&#8208;photon polymerization. The platform can detect biomarkers within a concentration range suitable for both healthy individuals and patients.








Abstract
Microneedles (MNs) or microneedle arrays (MNAs) are critical components of minimally invasive devices comprised of a single or a series of micro&#8208;scale projections. MNs can bypass the outermost layer of the skin and painlessly access microcirculation of the epidermis and dermis layers, attracting great interest in the development of personalized healthcare monitoring and diagnostic devices. However, MN technology has not yet reached its full potential since current micro&#8208; and nanofabrication methods do not address the need of fabricating MNs with complex surfaces to facilitate the development of clinically adequate devices. This work presents a new approach that combines 3D printing technology based on two&#8208;photon polymerization with soft lithography for cost&#8208;effective and time&#8208;saving fabrication of complex MNAs. Specifically, this method relies on printing complex 3D objects efficiently replicated into polymeric substrates via soft lithography, resulting in a free&#8208;standing polymeric lattice (PL) membrane that can be transferred onto gold&#8208;coated MNs and used for electrochemical biosensing. This platform shows excellent electrochemical performance in detecting metabolite (glucose) and protein (insulin) biomarkers with a dynamic linear range sufficient for detecting biomarkers in healthy individuals and patients. The approach holds great potential for fabricating next&#8208;generationMNs, including their transfer into clinically adequate devices.

         <title>Absolutely Structural Disorder Boosting Bandwidth toward Full&#8208;Spectrum White Light from Single Occupancy of Activator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An absolutely structural disorder strategy is proposed to design the full&#8208;spectrum white light phosphor Y0.785Ta0.215O1.715:Bi3+. This phosphor achieves a FWHM of 6194&#160;cm&#8722;1 from a single crystallographic site. White&#8208;LEDs based on this single&#8208;emitting&#8208;center white phosphor exhibit zero&#8208;chromaticity drift under various currents and after ultra&#8208;long&#8208;term continuous operation.








Abstract
Achieving single&#8208;phase full&#8208;spectrum white light (SFWL) phosphors is a central goal in the&#160;optical field because they simplify white&#8208;LEDs assembly and avoid long&#8208;term color instability. Despite many approaches are developed, current SFWL phosphors still suffer from chromaticity drift due to inconsistent thermal quenching of multiple emitting centers. Herein, an absolutely structural disorder strategy is established to develop a single&#8208;emitting center&#8208;based SFWL phosphor. Precisely controlling the flux added induces a structural translation from the absolutely ordered Y0.75Ta0.25O1.75:Bi3+ to the absolutely disordered Y0.785Ta0.215O1.715:Bi3+, as directly identified by STEM&#8208;HAADF analyses. Structural disorder enables Y0.785Ta0.215O1.715:Bi3+ to produce SFWL with the FWHM of 6194&#160;cm&#8722;1 (175&#160;nm) by employing a single activator site, a 1352&#160;cm&#8722;1 increase compared to the cyan&#8208;emitting Y0.75Ta0.25O1.75:Bi3+ despite Bi3+ occupies two lattice positions. This single&#8208;emitting center&#8208;based SFWL, coupled with minimal thermal expansion of the unit cell and inapparent spectral overlap of excitation and emission bands, ensure zero&#8208;chromaticity shift with elevated temperature. A prototype white&#8208;LEDs using Y0.785Ta0.215O1.715:Bi3+ as a single luminescent layer generates warm white light without perceptible CIE coordinates shift under various currents or after extremely long&#8208;term continuous operation. This work highlights the potential of structural disorder in designing SFWL phosphors with exceptional color stability.

         <title>Insulator&#8208;to&#8208;Metal Transition and Isotropic Gigantic Magnetoresistance in Layered Magnetic Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing strong exchange splitting in isotropic magnetic material, magnetic field&#8208;induced insulator&#8208;to&#8208;metal transition accompanied by gigantic, isotropic magnetoresistance is realized in a pristine material for the first time in a layered compound, holding great promise to revolutionize device technologies.








Abstract
Magnetotransport, the response of electrical conduction to external magnetic field, acts as an important tool to reveal fundamental concepts behind exotic phenomena and plays a key role in enabling spintronic applications. Magnetotransport is generally sensitive to magnetic field orientations. In contrast, efficient and isotropic modulation of electronic transport, which is useful in technology applications such as omnidirectional sensing, is rarely seen, especially for pristine crystals. Here a strategy is proposed to realize extremely strong modulation of electron conduction by magnetic field which is independent of field direction. GdPS, a layered antiferromagnetic semiconductor with resistivity anisotropies, supports a field&#8208;driven insulator&#8208;to&#8208;metal transition with a paradoxically isotropic gigantic negative magnetoresistance insensitive to magnetic field orientations. This isotropic magnetoresistance originates from the combined effects of a near&#8208;zero spin&#8211;orbit coupling of Gd3+&#8208;based half&#8208;filling f&#8208;electron system and the strong on&#8208;site f&#8211;d exchange coupling in Gd atoms. These results not only provide&#160;a novel material system with extraordinary magnetotransport that offers a missing block for antiferromagnet&#8208;based ultrafast and efficient spintronic devices, but also demonstrate the key ingredients for designing magnetic materials with desired transport properties for advanced functionalities.

This isotropic magnetoresistance originates from the combined effects of a near-zero spin&#8211;orbit coupling of Gd&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;-based half-filling &lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;-electron system and the strong on-site &lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;&#8211;&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; exchange coupling in Gd atoms. These results not only provide&#160;a novel material system with extraordinary magnetotransport that offers a missing block for antiferromagnet-based ultrafast and efficient spintronic devices, but also demonstrate the key ingredients for designing magnetic materials with desired transport properties for advanced functionalities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Schematic illustration of the periodic single&#8208;metal site catalysts (PSMSCs) with the atomically dispersed and uniform structure of metal sites, exhibiting enhanced activity, optimized selectivity, mechanism exploration ability, predictable reactivity, and intricate reaction suitability.








Abstract
Heterogeneous single&#8208;metal&#8208;site catalysts (SMSCs), often referred to as single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), demonstrate promising catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability across a wide spectrum of reactions due to their rationally designed microenvironments encompassing coordination geometry, binding ligands, and electronic configurations. However, the inherent disorderliness of SMSCs at both atomic scale and nanoscale poses challenges in deciphering working principles and establishing the correlations between microenvironments and the catalytic performances of SMSCs. The rearrangement of randomly dispersed single metals into homogeneous and atomic&#8208;precisely structured periodic single&#8208;metal site catalysts (PSMSCs) not only simplifies the chaos in SMSCs systems but also unveils new opportunities for manipulating catalytic performance and gaining profound insights into reaction mechanisms. Moreover, the synergistic effects of adjacent single metals and the integration effects of periodic single&#8208;metal arrangement further broaden the industrial application scope of SMSCs. This perspective offers a comprehensive overview of recent advancements and outlines prospective avenues for research in the design and characterizations of PSMSCs, while also acknowledging the formidable challenges encountered and the promising prospects that lie ahead.

         <title>Autonomous Atmospheric Water Harvesting over a Wide RH Range Enabled by Super Hygroscopic Composite Aerogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sodium alginate/carbon nanotubes/magnesium complexes&#160;(SA/CNTs/MC) composite aerogel is developed with high water uptake and rapid water vapor absorption/desorption kinetics.&#160;A fully solar&#8208;driven autonomous atmospheric water generator is designed and constructed with two SA/CNTs/MC&#8208;based absorption layers, which can alternately conduct the water absorption/desorption process without any other energy consumption.








Abstract
Sorption&#8208;based atmospheric water harvesting (SAWH) offers a sustainable strategy to address the global freshwater shortage. However, obtaining sorbents with excellent performance over a wide relative humidity (RH) range and devices with fully autonomous water production remains challenging. Herein, magnesium chloride (MgCl2) is innovatively converted into super hygroscopic magnesium complexes(MC), which can effectively solve the problems of salt deliquescence and agglomeration. The MC are then integrated with photothermal aerogels composed of sodium alginate and carbon nanotubes (SA/CNTs) to form composite aerogels, which showed high water uptake over a wide RH range, reaching 5.43 and 0.27&#160;kg kg&#8722;1 at 95% and 20% RH, respectively. The hierarchical porous structure enables the as&#8208;prepared SA/CNTs/MC to exhibit rapid absorption/desorption kinetics with 12 cycles per day at 70% RH, equivalent to a water yield of 10.0 L kg&#8722;1 day&#8722;1. To further realize continuous and practical freshwater production, a fully solar&#8208;driven autonomous atmospheric water generator is designed and constructed with two SA/CNTs/MC&#8208;based absorption layers, which can alternately conduct the water absorption/desorption process without any other energy consumption. The design provides a promising approach to achieving autonomous, high&#8208;performance, and scalable SAWH.

         <title>Bioinspired Capillary Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric re&#8208;entrant structures with long overhangs and connected forward/lateral microchannels are 3D printed to promote the unidirectional capillary rise, whose capillary heights have approached the theoretical limits. Capillary transistors based on asymmetric and symmetric re&#8208;entrant structures are proposed to provide a new strategy for microfluidic devices in 3D space.








Abstract
Inspired by the unidirectional liquid spreading on Nepenthes peristome, Araucaria leaf, butterfly wings, etc., various microfluidic devices have been developed for water collection, irrigation, physical/chemical reaction, and oil&#8211;water separation. Despite extensive progress, most natural and artificial structures fail to enhance the Laplace pressure difference or capillary force, thus suffering from a low unidirectional capillary height (&lt;30&#160;mm). In this work, asymmetric re&#8208;entrant structures with long overhangs and connected forward/lateral microchannels are fabricated by 3D printing, resulting in a significantly increased unidirectional capillary height of 102.3&#160;mm for water, which approximately corresponds to the theoretical limit. The overhangs can partially overlap the forward microchannels of the front structures without direct contact, thus enhancing the Laplace pressure difference and capillary force simultaneously. Based on asymmetric and symmetric re&#8208;entrant structures, capillary transistors are proposed and realized to programmably adjust the capillary direction, height, and width, which are envisioned to function as switches/valves and amplifiers/attenuators for highly efficient liquid patterning, desalination, and biochemical microreaction in 3D space.

         <title>Biointerface&#8208;Engineered Hybrid Nanovesicles for Targeted Reprogramming of Tumor Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanoplatform combining M1&#8208;like macrophage&#8208;derived exosomes and AS1411 aptamer&#8208;modified liposomes is developed, as P&#8208;I@M1E/AALs, exhibiting enhanced cargo&#8208;loading capability and stability. P&#8208;I@M1E/AALs can effectively facilitate oxygen and photosensitizer delivery, achieving in situ engineering of tumor&#8208;associated macrophages and alleviation of tumor hypoxia. This approach reprograms tumor microenvironment and suppresses tumor growth, demonstrating a promising strategy for antitumor therapy.








Abstract
The tumor microenvironment (TME) of typical tumor types such as triple&#8208;negative breast cancer is featured by hypoxia and immunosuppression with abundant tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs), which also emerge as potential therapeutic targets for antitumor therapy. M1&#8208;like macrophage&#8208;derived exosomes (M1&#8208;Exos) have emerged as a promising tumor therapeutic candidate for their tumor&#8208;targeting and macrophage&#8208;polarization capabilities. However, the limited drug&#8208;loading efficiency and stability of M1&#8208;Exos have hindered their effectiveness in antitumor applications. Here, a hybrid nanovesicle is developed by integrating M1&#8208;Exos with AS1411 aptamer&#8208;conjugated liposomes (AApt&#8208;Lips), termed M1E/AALs. The obtained M1E/AALs are loaded with&#160;perfluorotributylamine (PFTBA)&#160;and IR780, as P&#8208;I, to construct P&#8208;I@M1E/AALs for reprogramming TME by alleviating tumor hypoxia and engineering TAMs. P&#8208;I@M1E/AAL&#8208;mediated tumor therapy enhances the in situ generation of reactive oxygen species, repolarizes TAMs toward an antitumor phenotype, and promotes the infiltration of T lymphocytes. The synergistic antitumor therapy based on P&#8208;I@M1E/AALs significantly suppresses tumor growth and prolongs the survival of 4T1&#8208;tumor&#8208;bearing mice. By integrating multiple treatment modalities, P&#8208;I@M1E/AAL nanoplatform demonstrates a promising therapeutic approach for overcoming hypoxic and immunosuppressive TME by targeted TAM reprogramming and enhanced tumor photodynamic immunotherapy. This study highlights an innovative TAM&#8208;engineering hybrid nanovesicle platform for the treatment of tumors characterized by hypoxic and immunosuppressive TME.

         <title>Highly Efficient Wide Bandgap Perovskite Solar Cells With Tunneling Junction by Self&#8208;Assembled 2D Dielectric Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;assembled 2D perovskite layer (BA&#8322;PbBr&#8324;) is engineered as a tunneling layer to mitigate the band alignment mismatch between SnO&#8322; and wide bandgap perovskite layers. This approach significantly enhanced the open&#8208;circuit voltage, achieving values of 1.30 and 1.33&#160;V, and resulted in power conversion efficiencies of 21.54% and 19.16% for bandgaps of 1.7 and 1.8 eV, respectively.








Abstract
Reducing non&#8208;radiative recombination and addressing band alignment mismatches at interfaces remain major challenges in achieving high&#8208;performance wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells. This study proposes the self&#8208;organization of a thin two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskite BA2PbBr4 layer beneath a wide&#8208;bandgap three&#8208;dimensional (3D) perovskite Cs0.17FA0.83Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3, forming a 2D/3D bilayer structure on a tin oxide (SnO2) layer. This process is driven by interactions between the oxygen vacancies on the SnO2 surface and hydrogen atoms of the n&#8208;butylammonium cation, aiding the self&#8208;assembly of the BA2PbBr4 2D layer. The 2D perovskite acts as a tunneling layer between SnO2 and the 3D perovskite, neutralizing the energy level mismatch and reducing non&#8208;radiative recombination. This results in high power conversion efficiencies of 21.54% and 19.16% for wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells with bandgaps of 1.7 and 1.8 eV, with open&#8208;circuit voltages over 1.3 V under 1&#8208;Sun illumination. Furthermore, an impressive efficiency of over 43% is achieved under indoor conditions, specifically under 200 lux white light&#8208;emitting diode light, yielding an output voltage exceeding 1 V. The device also demonstrates enhanced stability, lasting up to 1,200 hours.

         <title>Magneto&#8208;Enzymatic Microgels for Precise Hydrogel Sculpturing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magneto&#8208;enzymatic microgels, consisting of collagenase and magnetic nanoparticles, are used to sculpt internal channels within biomimetic hydrogels through the synergy of enzymatic degradation and remote magnetic guidance. This approach enhances cell viability by optimizing nutrient and oxygen distribution beyond conventional methods. Wireless control enables intricate hydrogel topographies, advancing vascularization and targeted drug delivery, marking a notable achievement in biofabrication.








Abstract
The inclusion of hollow channels in tissue&#8208;engineered hydrogels is crucial for mimicking the natural physiological conditions and facilitating the delivery of nutrients and oxygen to cells. Although bio&#8208;fabrication techniques provide diverse strategies to create these channels, many require sophisticated equipment and time&#8208;consuming protocols. Herein, collagenase, a degrading agent for methacrylated gelatin hydrogels, and magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) are combined and processed into enzymatically active spherical structures using a straightforward oil bath emulsion methodology. The generated microgels are then used to microfabricate channels within biomimetic hydrogels via a novel sculpturing approach that relied on the precise coupling of protein&#8208;enzyme pairs (for controlled local degradation) and magnetic actuation (for directional control). Results show that the sculpting velocity can be tailored by adjusting the magnetic field intensity or concentration of MNPs within the microgels. Additionally, varying the magnetic field position or microgel size generated diverse trajectories and channels of different widths. This innovative technology improves the viability of encapsulated cells through enhanced medium transport, outperforming non&#8208;sculpted hydrogels and offering new perspectives for hydrogel vascularization and drug/biomolecule administration. Ultimately, this novel concept can help design fully controlled channels in hydrogels or soft materials, even those with complex tortuosity, in a single wireless top&#8208;down biocompatible step.

         <title>Ionizable Drugs Enable Intracellular Delivery of Co&#8208;Formulated siRNA</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co&#8208;delivery of small molecule drugs and ribonucleic acids (RNA) in the same nanocarrier can unlock the benefits of combination therapies, but current formulation strategies are typically limited by low drug loading. Here, ionizable analogs of a colloid&#8208;forming drug, fulvestrant, are used to formulate high&#8208;content nanoparticles that encapsulate small interfering RNA (siRNA). This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study demonstrates effective siRNA delivery by ionizable drugs.








Abstract
Targeting complementary pathways in diseases such as cancer can be achieved with co&#8208;delivery of small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) and small molecule drugs; however, current formulation strategies are typically limited to one, but not both. Here, ionizable small molecule drugs and siRNA are co&#8208;formulated&#160;in drug&#8208;rich nanoparticles. Ionizable analogs of the selective estrogen receptor degrader fulvestrant self&#8208;assemble into colloidal drug aggregates and cause endosomal disruption, allowing co&#8208;delivery of siRNA against a non&#8208;druggable target. siRNA is encapsulated in lipid&#8208;stabilized, drug&#8208;rich colloidal nanoparticles where the ionizable lipid used in conventional lipid nanoparticles is replaced with an ionizable fulvestrant analog. The selection of an appropriate phospholipid and formulation buffer enables endocytosis and potent reporter gene knockdown in cancer cells. Importantly, siRNA targeting cyclin E1 is effectively delivered to drug&#8208;resistant breast cancer cells, demonstrating the utility of this approach. This strategy opens the possibility of using ionizable drugs to co&#8208;deliver RNA and ultimately improve therapeutic outcomes.

         <title>Chirality&#8208;Induced Magnetic Polarization by Charge Localization in a Chiral Supramolecular Crystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity effect is a fascinating phenomenon that correlates the molecular structure with electron spin&#8208;polarization. In this work, chiral crystals of imide&#8208;substituted coronene bisimide ((S)&#8208;CBI&#8208;GCH) are studied to show that current flows dynamically, controlled by the voltage sweep rate. This observation is crucial for redox group molecules, and sheds light on the possible origin of spin&#8208;polarization in chiral molecules. 








Abstract
The chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect is a fascinating phenomenon that correlates the molecular structure with electron spin&#8208;polarization (SP). Experimental procedures to quantify the spin&#8208;filtering magnitude have extensively used magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;dependent conductive AFM. In this work chiral crystals of imide&#8208;substituted coronene bisimide ((S)&#8208;CBI&#8208;GCH) are studied to explain the dynamics of the current&#8211;voltage I &#8722; V spectra and the origin of superimposed peaks are investigated. A dynamic voltage&#8208;sweep rate&#8208;dependent phenomenon can give rise to complex I &#8722; V curves. The redox group, capable of localization of charge, acts as a localized state that interferes with the continuum of the &#960; &#8211; &#960; stacking, giving rise to Fano resonances. A novel mechanism for dynamic transport is introduced, which provides insight into the origin of spin&#8208;polarized charge in crystallized CBI&#8208;GCH molecules after absorption on a metallic substrate, guided by transient charge polarization. Crucially, interference between charge localization and delocalization during transport may be important properties in understanding the magnetochiral phenomena observed by electrostatic force microscopy. Finally, it is observed that charge trapping sensitively modifies the injection barrier from direct tunneling to Fowler&#8211;Nordheim tunneling transport supporting nonlinearity in CISS for this class of molecules.

         <title>Programmable Chemical Reactions Enable Ultrastrong Soft Pneumatic Actuation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By integrating thermoelectric materials and preprogramming strategy into the management of reversible reactions, an soft pneumatic actuation is realized with high regulation, high pressure, and the ability to transport gas over long distances. The soft pneumatic actuation is successfully applying the programmable chemical reactions to soft assistive wearables, haptic devices, and lifting a sightseeing car.








Abstract
Soft pneumatic actuation is widely used in wearable devices, soft robots, artificial muscles, and surgery machines. However, generating high&#8208;pressure gases in a soft, controllable, and portable way remains a substantial challenge.

&lt;p&gt;By integrating thermoelectric materials and preprogramming strategy into the management of reversible reactions, an soft pneumatic actuation is realized with high regulation, high pressure, and the ability to transport gas over long distances. The soft pneumatic actuation is successfully applying the programmable chemical reactions to soft assistive wearables, haptic devices, and lifting a sightseeing car.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soft pneumatic actuation is widely used in wearable devices, soft robots, artificial muscles, and surgery machines. However, generating high-pressure gases in a soft, controllable, and portable way remains a substantial challenge. Here, a class of programmable chemical reactions that can be used to controllably generate gases with a maximum pressure output of nearly 6&#160;MPa is reported. It is proposed to realize the programmability of the chemical reaction process using thermoelectric material with programmable electric current and employing preprogrammed reversible chemical reactants.

         <title>Exciton Dissociation and Recombination Afford Narrowband Organic Afterglow Through Efficient FRET</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient strategy is proposed for achieving narrow&#8208;band, long&#8208;lived, and full&#8208;color organic long&#8208;persistent luminescence (LPL) by isolating multi&#8208;resonant thermally activated delayed fluorescent fluorophores in a steroid&#8208;type host capable of exciton dissociation and recombination. Through efficient FRET, the LPL exhibits a small full&#8208;width at a half&#8208;maximum of 33&#160;nm, persistent time exceeding 10&#160;s, and tunable color among 414&#8211;600&#160;nm.








Abstract
Organic afterglow with long&#8208;persistent luminescence (LPL) after photoexcitation is highly attractive, but the realization of narrowband afterglow with small full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) is a huge challenge since it is intrinsically contradictory to the triplet&#8208; and solid&#8208;state emission nature of organic afterglow. Here, narrow&#8208;band, long&#8208;lived, and full&#8208;color organic LPL is realized by isolating multi&#8208;resonant thermally activated delayed fluorescent (MR&#8208;TADF) fluorophores in a glassy steroid&#8208;type host through a facile melt&#8208;cooling treatment. Such prepared host becomes capable of exciton dissociation and recombination (EDR) upon photoirradiation for both long&#8208;lived fluorescence and phosphorescence; and, the efficient F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from the host to various MR&#8208;TADF emitters leads to high&#8208;performance LPL, exhibiting small FWHM of 33&#160;nm, long persistent time over 10&#160;s, and facile color&#8208;tuning in a wide range from deep&#8208;blue to orange (414&#8211;600&#160;nm). Moreover, with the extraordinary narrowband LPL and easy processability of the material, centimeter&#8208;scale flexible optical waveguide fibers and integrated FWHM/color/lifetime&#8208;resolved multilevel encryption/decryption devices have been designed and fabricated. This novel EDR and singlet/triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet FRET strategy to achieve excellent LPL performances illustrates a promising way for constructing flexible organic afterglow with easy preparation methods, shedding valuable scientific insights into the design of narrow&#8208;band emission in organic afterglow.

         <title>Multicompartment Polyion Complex Micelles Based on Triblock Polypept(o)ides Mediate Efficient siRNA Delivery to Cancer&#8208;Associated Fibroblasts for Antistromal Therapy of Hepatocellular Carcinoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
With a novel identified target of cancer&#8208;associated fibroblast&#8208;derived microfibrillar&#8208;associated protein 5 (MFAP&#8208;5), ABC&#8208;triblock copolymer&#8208;based multicompartment polyion complex micelle delivers siRNA against MFAP&#8208;5 (siMFAP&#8208;5) and the cationic amphiphilic drug desloratatine simultaneously. The codelivery of DES facilitates intracellular siRNA delivery, resulting in a knockdown of MFAP&#8208;5 and significantly reduced&#160;tumor burden in a mice model of hepatocellular carcinoma.








Abstract
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most frequent type of primary liver cancer and the third leading cause for cancer&#8208;related death worldwide. The tumor is difficult&#8208;to&#8208;treat due to its inherent resistance to chemotherapy. Antistromal therapy is a novel therapeutic approach, targeting cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts (CAF) in the tumor microenvironment. CAF&#8208;derived microfibrillar&#8208;associated protein 5 (MFAP&#8208;5) is identified as a novel target for antistromal therapy of HCC with high translational relevance. Biocompatible polypept(o)ide&#8208;based polyion complex micelles (PICMs) constructed with a triblock copolymer composed of a cationic poly(l&#8208;lysine) complexing anti&#8208;MFAP&#8208;5 siRNA (siMFAP&#8208;5) via electrostatic interaction, a poly(&#947;&#8208;benzyl&#8208;l&#8208;glutamate) block loading cationic amphiphilic drug desloratatine (DES) via &#960;&#8211;&#960;&#160;interaction as endosomal escape enhancer and polysarcosine poly(N&#8208;methylglycine) for introducing stealth properties, are generated for siRNA delivery. Intravenous injection of siMFAP&#8208;5/DES PICMs significantly reduces the hepatic tumor burden in a syngeneic implantation model of HCC, with a superior MFAP&#8208;5 knockdown effect over siMFAP&#8208;5 PICMs or lipid nanoparticles. Transcriptome and histological analysis reveal that MFAP&#8208;5 knockdown inhibited CAF&#8208;related tumor vascularization, suggesting the anti&#8208;angiogenic effect of RNA interference therapy. In conclusion, multicompartment PICMs combining siMFAP&#8208;5 and DES in a single polypept(o)ide micelle induce a specific knockdown of MFAP&#8208;5 and demonstrate a potent antitumor efficacy (80% reduced tumor burden vs untreated control) in a clinically relevant HCC model.

         <title>Ultrahigh Single Au Atoms Loaded Porous Aromatic Frameworks for Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in situ strategy with pre&#8208;metallated monomers is employed to achieve a new porous aromatic framework (PAF&#8208;164) with Au single atoms loading up to a record high 45.3 wt.%. The serial PAF supported Au single atoms catalysts exhibit excellent photocatalytic activities toward hydrogen evolution.








Abstract
Supported single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are promising in heterogeneous catalysis because of their atom economy, unusual transformations, and mechanistic clarity. The metal SAs loading, however, limits the catalytic efficiency. Herein, an in situ pre&#8208;metallated monomer&#8208;based preparation strategy is shown to achieve ultrahigh Au SAs loading in catalyst formations. The polymerization of single&#8208;atom loaded monomers yield a new porous aromatic framework (PAF&#8208;164) with Au SAs loading up to a record high 45.3 wt.%. SACs of Au&#8208;PAFs exhibit excellent photocatalytic activity in hydrogen (H2) evolution, and the H2 evolution rate of Au100%&#8208;SAs&#8208;PAF&#8208;164 can reach 4.82&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with great recyclability.

         <title>Operando Colorations from Real&#8208;Time Growth of 3D&#8208;Printed Nanoarchitectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Considering that most colors fade with time, this work develops an additive approach to diversify colors over time. This color enrichment is realized by operando observation and measurement of the real&#8208;time growth of subwavelength metallic nanoarchitectures during 3D nanoprinting. The dimensions and geometries of these growing nanoarchitectures change in real time, thereby generating a magnificent library of time&#8208;varying colors.








Abstract
While artificial 3D nanostructures can generate precise and flexible coloration, their real&#8208;time color changes during 3D nanoprinting remain unexplored owing&#160;to the inherent challenges of in situ transient measurements and observations. In this study, a 3D&#8208;printing system which supports the operando observation/measurement of the color dynamics of subwavelength metallic nanoarchitectures fabricated in real time is developed and evaluated. During 3D printing, the dimensions and geometries of the 3D nanostructures grow over time, producing a large library of optical spectra associated with real&#8208;time color changes.

     alt="Operando Colorations from Real-Time Growth of 3D-Printed Nanoarchitectures"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering that most colors fade with time, this work develops an additive approach to diversify colors over time. This color enrichment is realized by operando observation and measurement of the real-time growth of subwavelength metallic nanoarchitectures during 3D nanoprinting. The dimensions and geometries of these growing nanoarchitectures change in real time, thereby generating a magnificent library of time-varying colors.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While artificial 3D nanostructures can generate precise and flexible coloration, their real-time color changes during 3D nanoprinting remain unexplored owing&#160;to the inherent challenges of in situ transient measurements and observations. In this study, a 3D-printing system which supports the operando observation/measurement of the color dynamics of subwavelength metallic nanoarchitectures fabricated in real time is developed and evaluated. During 3D printing, the dimensions and geometries of the 3D nanostructures grow over time, producing a large library of optical spectra associated with real-time color changes. Only a timer is needed to define the expected colors from a single 3D print run. Fin-like nanostructures are used to toggle colors based on the polarization effect and produce color gradients. Based on structural coloration, nanoarchitectures are designed and printed to animate desired color patterns. Moreover, the resulting color dynamics can also serve as an operando identifier for real-time structural information during 3D nanoprinting.

         <title>Ternary Logic Circuit and Neural Network Integration via Small Molecule&#8208;Based Antiambipolar Vertical Electrochemical Transistor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antiambipolar behavior is observed in a small molecule&#8208;based vertical organic electrochemical transistor with a current density &gt; 30&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2, and low driving voltage (0.6&#160;V). Consequently, a vertically stacked ternary inverter (VSTI) is fabricated with three distinguishable logic states, along with the demonstration for image recognition tasks based on ternary neural networks with such VSTI array.








Abstract
Circuits based on organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) have great potential in the fields of biosensors and artificial neural computation due to their biocompatibility and neural similarity. However, the integration of OECT&#8208;based circuits lags far behind other emerging electronics. Here, ternary inverters based on antiambipolar vertical OECTs (vOECTs) and their integration with the establishment of neural networks are demonstrated. Specifically, by adopting a small molecule (t&#8208;gdiPDI) as the channel of vOECT, high antiambipolar performance, with current density&#160;of 33.9&#160;&#177;&#160;2.1&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 under drain voltage of 0.1&#160;V, peak voltage &#8776;0&#160;V, low driving voltage &lt; &#177; 0.6&#160;V, and current on/off ratio&#160;&gt;&#160;106, are realized. Consequently, vertically stacked ternary circuits based solely on OECTs are constructed for the first time, showing three distinct logical states and high integration density. By further developing inverter array as the internal fundamental units of ternary weight network hardware circuits for ternary processing and computation, it demonstrates excellent data classification and recognition capabilities. This work demonstrates the possibility of constructing multi&#8208;valued logic circuits by OECTs and promotes a new strategy for high&#8208;density integration and multivalued computing systems based on organic circuits.

         <title>Structural Regulation of Au&#8208;Pt Bimetallic Aerogels for Catalyzing the Glucose Cascade Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work leverages the structural versatility of aerogels to regulate the Au&#8211;Pt bimetallic system into three representative structures, including segregated, alloy, and core&#8211;shell configurations and investigates the structure&#8211;activity relationship toward glucose cascade catalysis. Among them, the Au&#8211;Pt segregated structure exhibits the optimal enzyme&#8208;mimic catalytic performances, which is ascribed to the synergistic effect and abundant grain boundaries.








Abstract
Bimetallic nanostructures are promising candidates for the development of enzyme&#8208;mimics, yet the deciphering of the structural impact on their catalytic properties poses significant challenges. By leveraging the structural versatility of nanocrystal aerogels, this study reports a precise control of Au&#8211;Pt bimetallic structures in three representative structural configurations, including segregated, alloy, and core&#8211;shell structures. Benefiting from a synergistic effect, these bimetallic aerogels demonstrate improved peroxidase&#8208; and glucose oxidase&#8208;like catalytic performances compared to their monometallic counterparts, unleashing tremendous potential in catalyzing the glucose cascade reaction. Notably, the segregated Au&#8211;Pt aerogel shows optimal catalytic activity, which is 2.80 and 3.35 times higher than that of the alloy and core&#8211;shell variants, respectively. This enhanced activity is attributed to the high&#8208;density Au&#8211;Pt interface boundaries within the segregated structure, which foster greater substrate affinity and superior catalytic efficiency. This work not only sheds light on the structure&#8211;property relationship of bimetallic catalysts but also broadens the application scope of aerogels in biosensing and biological detections.

         <title>Asymmetric Wettability Hydrogel Surfaces for Enduring Electromyographic Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reversal wettability inducing strategy based on hydrophobic interaction is proposed to integrally synthesize Janus hydrogel without affecting the mechanical elasticity and electrical properties. This interfacial engineering successfully realizes the optional inducing on the hydrogel surfaces. A combination of asymmetric wettability surfaces, excellent elasticity, and compatible conductivity endows the hydrogel electrode patch with a high&#8208;fidelity EMG signal in a perspiration environment.








Abstract
Hydrogel electrode interfaces have shown tremendous promise in the acquisition of surface electromyography (EMG) signals. However, the perspiration or moisture environments will trigger the deadhesion between hydrogel electrodes and human skin. Despite the hydrophobic/hydrophilic surfaces can perform the anti&#8208;moisture or adhesion respectively, it remains a challenge to integrally form a Janus hydrogel with homogeneous mechanical elasticity and electronic performance. Herein, a surface induction strategy is proposed to approach the hydrophobic/hydrophilic hydrogel surfaces. The hydrophobic interaction between surfactants and molds regulates the distribution of hydrophobic/hydrophilic monomers on the surface. The hydrophobic molds induce a hydrophilic hydrogel surface, while the hydrophilic molds induce a hydrophobic surface. It presents a new phenomenon of reversal wettability inducing and optional hydrogel surfaces. The integral Janus hydrogel can be easily obtained by the hydrophilic molds. Balance of adhesion, elasticity, and conductivity endows the hydrogel electrode patch with durable conformal adhesion and high&#8208;fidelity EMG signals even in the sweaty epidermis due to the asymmetric wettability surfaces. This hydrogel performs the quantitative description of muscle strength and accurate fatigue assessment. It offers a reliable candidate for future practical applications in continuous digital healthcare and intelligent human&#8211;machine interaction, even the Metaverse.

         <title>Human Circulatory/Respiratory&#8208;Inspired Comprehensive Air Purification System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A circulatory/respiratory&#8208;inspired air purification system (CAPS) is reported, a novel bioinspired approach that integrates microbubble&#8208;based gas exchange and circulating liquid (water) mechanisms akin to alveoli, capillary beds, and the bloodstream. By incorporating waste removal, CAPS ensures continuous particulate matter removal and gas exchange between indoor and outdoor spaces, with the potential for networked integration across various internal and external environments.








Abstract
The circulatory and respiratory systems in humans are marvels of biological engineering that exhibit competence in maintaining homeostasis. These systems not only shield the organism from external contaminants but also orchestrate the vital gases via the bloodstream to sustain cellular respiration and metabolic processes across diverse tissues. It is noticed that spaces inhabited encounter challenges akin to those of the human body: protecting the indoor air from external pollutants while removing anthropogenic byproducts like carbon dioxide (CO2), particulate matters (PM), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) tooutside. A biomimetic approach, composed of a microbubble&#8208;based gas exchanger and circulating liquid inspired by alveoli, capillary beds, and bloodstream of the human circulatory/respiratory system, offer an innovative solution for comprehensive air purification of hermetic spaces. Circulatory/respiratory&#8208;inspired air purification system (CAPS) ensure both continuous removal of PM and exchange of gas species between indoor and outdoor environments to maintain homeostasis. The effectiveness of this system is also supported by animal behavior experiments with and without CAPS, showing an effect of reducing CO2 concentration by 30% and increasing mice locomotor activity by 53%. CAPS is expected to evolve into robust and comprehensive air purification schemes through the networked integration of plural internal and external environments.

         <title>Proximal High&#8208;Index Metamaterials based on a Superlattice of Gold Nanohexagons Targeting the Near&#8208;Infrared Band</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Plasmonic gold nanohexagons (AuNHs) assembled into a planar superlattice serve as optical metamaterials for precise refractive index (RI) control. With controlled gap proximities in an edge&#8208;to&#8208;edge manner, they exhibit unprecedented optical properties in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) band, achieving an RI of 10.04 at &#955; = 1.5 &#181;m. The RI tunability is shown by varying nanometer&#8208;scale gaps, promising significant optical advancements.








Abstract
Plasmonic nanoparticles can be assembled into a superlattice, to form optical metamaterials, particularly targeting precise control of optical properties such as refractive index (RI). The superlattices exhibit enhanced near&#8208;field, given the sufficiently narrow gap between nanoparticles supporting multiple plasmonic resonance modes only realized in proximal environments. Herein, the planar superlattice of plasmonic Au nanohexagons (AuNHs) with precisely controlled geometries such as size, shape, and edge&#8208;gaps is reported. The proximal AuNHs superlattice realized over a large area with selective edge&#8208;to&#8208;edge assembly exhibited the highest&#8208;ever&#8208;recorded RI values in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) band, surpassing the upper limit of the RI of the natural intrinsic materials (up to 10.04 at &#955; = 1.5&#160;&#181;m). The exceptionally enhanced RI is derived from intensified in&#8208;plane surface plasmon coupling across the superlattices. Precise control of the edge&#8208;gap of neighboring AuNHs systematically tuned the RI as confirmed by numerical analysis based on the plasmonic percolation model. Furthermore, a 1D photonic crystal, composed of alternating layers of AuNHs superlattices and low&#8208;index polymers, is constructed to enhance the selectivity of the reflectivity operating in the NIR band. It is expected that the proximal AuNHs superlattices can be used as new optical metamaterials that can be extended to the NIR range.

         <title>A High Capacity Gas Diffusion Electrode for Li&#8211;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The capacity of lithium&#8211;oxygen batteries is limited by the mass transport of O2 throughout the porous positive electrode. Here it is shown that by replacing the binder in the electrode with a polymer that can transport O2, it is possible to reach energy densities that significantly exceed Li&#8208;ion batteries and previously reported Li&#8211;O2 cells.








Abstract
The very high theoretical specific energy of the lithium&#8211;air (Li&#8211;O2) battery (3500&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1) compared with other batteries makes it potentially attractive, especially for the electrification of flight. While progress has been made in realizing the Li&#8211;air battery, several challenges remain. One such challenge is achieving a high capacity to store charge at the positive electrode at practical current densities, without which Li&#8211;air batteries will not outperform lithium&#8208;ion. The capacity is limited by the mass transport of O2 throughout the porous carbon positive electrode. Here it is shown that by replacing the binder in the electrode by a polymer with the intrinsic ability to transport O2, it is possible to reach capacities as high as 31 mAh cm&#8722;2 at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in a 300&#160;&#181;m thick electrode. This corresponds to a positive electrode energy density of 2650&#160;Wh L&#8722;1 and specific energy of 1716&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, exceeding significantly Li&#8208;ion batteries and previously reported Li&#8211;O2 cells. Due to the enhanced oxygen diffusion imparted by the gas diffusion polymer, Li2O2 (the product of O2 reduction on discharge) fills a greater volume fraction of the electrode and is more homogeneously distributed.

         <title>In Situ&#8208;Constructed Multifunctional Composite Anode with Ultralong&#8208;Life Toward Advanced Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional Li/SnS2 composite anode is rationally designed through an in situ melt&#8208;infusion approach utilizing SnS2 as &#8216;solute&#8217; and molten lithium as the &#8216;solvent&#8217;. The 3D porous Li2S/Li22Sn5 framework possesses a&#160;low Li+ diffusion barrier, high electronic conductivity, and&#160;Li&#8208;clusters decomposition capability, thus effectively eliminating the growth of dendrite and enabling ultra&#8208;long cycling lifespan, especially at high rates.








Abstract
Metallic lithium is the most competitive anode material for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy batteries. Nevertheless, the extensive volume expansion and uncontrolled Li dendrite growth of lithium metal not only cause potential safety hazards but also lead to low Coulombic efficiency and inferior cycling lifespan for Li metal batteries. Herein, a multifunctional dendrite&#8208;free composite anode (Li/SnS2) is proposed through an in situ melt&#8208;infusion strategy. In this configuration, the 3D cross&#8208;linked porous Li2S/Li22Sn5 framework facilitates the rapid penetration of electrolytes and accommodates the volume expansion during the repeated Li&#8722;plating process. Meanwhile, the lithiophilic Li2S phases with a low Li+ transport barrier ensure preferential Li deposition, effectively avoiding uneven electron distribution. Moreover, the Li22Sn5 electron conductors with appropriate Li+ bonding ability guarantee rapid charge transport and mass transfer. Most importantly, the steady multifunctional skeleton with sufficient inner interfaces (Li2S/Li22Sn5) in the whole electrode, not only realizes the redistribution of the localized free electron, contributing to the decomposition of Li clusters, but also induces a planar deposition model, thus restraining the generation of Li dendrites. Consequently, an unprecedented cyclability of over 6&#160;500&#160;h under an ultrahigh areal capacity of 10&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 and a current rate of 20&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 is achieved for the prepared Li2S/Li22Sn5 composite anode. Moreover, the assembled Li/SnS2||LiFePO4 (LFP) pouch full&#8208;cells also demonstrate remarkable rate capability and a convincing cycling lifespan of more than 2&#160;000 cycles at 2 C.

         <title>Optical&#8208;Propulsion Metastructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces optical&#8208;propulsion metastructures, for enhanced laser micropropulsion performance. This metastructure achieves 99% light absorption efficiency and a material density of 0.958 g cm&#8722;3. It maintains exceptional energy conversion and structural integrity under adverse conditions. The cost&#8208;effective fabrication technique suggests scalability for future microspacecraft and nanosatellite propulsion systems.








Abstract
Pulsed laser micropropulsion (PLMP) offers a promising avenue for miniature space craft, yet conventional propellants face challenges in balancing efficiency and stability. An optical&#8208;propulsion metastructure strategy using metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) is presented to generate graphene&#8208;metal metastructures (GMM), specifically GMM&#8208;(HKUST&#8208;1), which significantly enhances PLMP performance. This novel approach leverages the unique interaction between pulsed lasers and the precisely engineered GMMs&#8212;comprising optimized metal nanoparticle size, graphene layers, and inter&#8208;particle gaps&#8212;to boost both propulsion efficiency and stability. Experimental and numerical analyses reveal that GMM&#8208;(HKUST&#8208;1) achieves aspecific impulse of 1072.94 s, ablation efficiency of 51.22%, and impulse thrust per mass of 105.15 &#181;N &#181;g&#8722;1, surpassing traditional propellants. With an average particle size of &#8776;12 nm and a density of 0.958&#160;g&#160;cm&#8722;3, these metastructures exhibit 99% light absorption efficiency and maintain stability under atmospheric and humid conditions. The graphene nanolayer efficiently absorbs and converts laser energy, while the metal nanostructures enhance light&#8208;matter interactions, promoting energy transfer and material stability. These findings suggest that this GMM&#8208;based optical&#8208;propulsion strategy can revolutionize microspacecraft propulsion and energy systems, offering significant advancements across various domains.

Experimental and numerical analyses reveal that GMM-(HKUST-1) achieves aspecific impulse of 1072.94 s, ablation efficiency of 51.22%, and impulse thrust per mass of 105.15 &#181;N &#181;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, surpassing traditional propellants. With an average particle size of &#8776;12 nm and a density of 0.958&#160;g&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;, these metastructures exhibit 99% light absorption efficiency and maintain stability under atmospheric and humid conditions. The graphene nanolayer efficiently absorbs and converts laser energy, while the metal nanostructures enhance light-matter interactions, promoting energy transfer and material stability. These findings suggest that this GMM-based optical-propulsion strategy can revolutionize microspacecraft propulsion and energy systems, offering significant advancements across various domains.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Robust Field&#8208;Free Switching Using Large Unconventional Spin&#8208;Orbit Torque in an All&#8208;Van der Waals Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study uses the low&#8208;symmetry Weyl semimetal TaIrTe4 and above&#8208;room&#8208;temperature van der Waals ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2 to achieve the field&#8208;free magnetization switching. The unconventional SOT effective field efficiency is determined to be 0.37, and the switching&#8208;polarity&#8208;change magnetic field is as high as 252&#160;mT, indicating a robust field&#8208;free switching against the external magnetic field.








Abstract
The emerging all&#8208;van der Waals (vdW) magnetic heterostructure provides a new platform to control the magnetization by the electric field beyond the traditional spintronics devices. One promising strategy is using unconventional spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT) exerted by the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarized spin current to enable deterministic magnetization switching and enhance the switching efficiency. However, in all&#8208;vdW heterostructures, large unconventional SOT remains elusive and the robustness of the field&#8208;free switching against external magnetic field has not been examined, which hinders further applications. Here, the study demonstrates the field&#8208;free switching in an all&#8208;vdW heterostructure combining a type&#8208;II Weyl semimetal TaIrTe4 and above&#8208;room&#8208;temperature ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2. The fully field&#8208;free switching can be achieved at 2.56 &#215; 1010 A&#160;m&#8722;2 at 300&#160;K and a large SOT effective field efficiency of the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarized spin current generated by TaIrTe4 is determined to be 0.37. Moreover, it is found that the switching polarity cannot be changed until the external in&#8208;plane magnetic field reaches 252&#160;mT, indicating a robust switching against the magnetic field. The numerical simulation suggests the large unconventional SOT reduces the switching current density and enhances the robustness of the switching. The work shows that all&#8208;vdW heterostructures are promising candidates for future highly efficient and stable SOT&#8208;based devices.

         <title>Self&#8208;Adhesive and Self&#8208;Sustainable Bioelectronic Patch for Physiological Feedback Electronic Modulation of Soft Organs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bionic electrical stimulation (Bio&#8208;ES), spontaneously synchronized with target neural signatures in a convenient and electronics&#8208;free form, has always been a coveted goal for the development of flexible bioelectronics technology. Targeting the above goal, the study develops a Bio&#8208;ES strategy synchronized with the vagal nerve impulses peak envelope for physiological feedback electronic modulation of visceral organs innervated by the vagal interoceptive system. In particular, it can operate self&#8208;sustainably without the need for any external energy input through a conformal self&#8208;adhesive design of tissue&#8208;device interface to realize dynamic synergizing with the real&#8208;time physiological environment via the electromechanical coupling effect.








Abstract
Bionic electrical stimulation (Bio&#8208;ES) aims to achieve personalized therapy and proprioceptive adaptation by mimicking natural neural signatures of the body, while current Bio&#8208;ES devices are reliant on complex sensing and computational simulation systems, thus often limited by the low&#8208;fidelity of simulated electrical signals, and failure of interface information interaction due to the mechanical mismatch between soft tissues and rigid electrodes. Here, the study presents a flexible and ultrathin self&#8208;sustainable bioelectronic patch (Bio&#8208;patch), which can self&#8208;adhere to the lesion area of organs and generate bionic electrical signals synchronized vagal nerve envelope in situ to implement Bio&#8208;ES. It allows adaptive adjustment of intensity, frequency, and waveform of the Bio&#8208;ES to fully meet personalized needs of tissue regeneration based on real&#8208;time feedback from the vagal neural controlled organs. With this foundation, the Bio&#8208;patch can effectively intervene with excessive fibrosis and microvascular stasis during the natural healing process by regulating the polarization time of macrophages, promoting the reconstruction of the tissue&#8208;engineered structure, and accelerating the repair of damaged liver and kidney. This work develops a practical approach to realize biomimetic electronic modulation of the growth and development of soft organs only using a multifunctional Bio&#8208;patch, which establishes a new paradigm for precise bioelectronic medicine.

         <title>A Strategy of Killing Two Birds With One Stone for Blocking Drug Resistance Spread With Engineered Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Living Bdello is engineered with polydopamine and a multinuclear cerium (IV) complex to construct Ce&#8208;PEA@Bdello for blocking the spread of drug resistance. Ce&#8208;PEA@Bdello exhibits synergistic functions in penetrating biofilms, killing bacteria and degrading drug&#8208;resistant genes, rendering it a versatile therapeutic for treating P. aeruginosa (KanR) infected scald/burn&#160;wounds by simultaneously eliminating resistant pathogens and blocking bacterial drug&#8208;resistance dissemination.








Abstract
Drug&#8208;resistant pathogens significantly threaten human health and life. Simply killing drug&#8208;resistant pathogens cannot effectively eliminate their threat since the drug&#8208;resistant genes (DRGs) released from dead drug&#8208;resistant pathogens are difficult to eliminate and can further spread via horizontal gene transfer, leading to the spread of drug resistance. The development of antibacterial materials with sterilization and DRGs cleavage activities is highly crucial. Herein, a living system, Ce&#8208;PEA@Bdello, is fabricated with bacterial killing and DRGs cleavage activities for blocking bacterial drug resistance dissemination by engineered Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus (Bdello). Ce&#8208;PEA@Bdello is obtained by engineering Bdello with dopamine and a multinuclear cerium (IV) complex. Ce&#8208;PEA@Bdello can penetrate and eliminate kanamycin&#8208;resistant P. aeruginosa (KanR) biofilms via the synergistic effect of predatory Bdello and photothermal polydopamine under near&#8208;infrared light. Additionally, the DNase&#8208;mimicking ability of Ce&#8208;PEA@Bdello endows it with genome and plasmid DNA cleavage ability. An in vivo study reveals that Ce&#8208;PEA@Bdello can eliminate P. aeruginosa (KanR) and cleave DRGs in scald/burn infected wounds to block the spread of drug resistance and accelerate wound healing. This bioactive system constructed from natural living materials offers a promising means for blocking the spread of drug resistance.

         <title>Sensitive SWIR Organic Photodetectors with Spectral Response Reaching 1.5&#160;&#181;m</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new non&#8208;fullerene acceptor exhibiting an ultralow bandgap of 0.83 eV and strong absorption extending up to 1.5 &#181;m is developed by rationally regulating its molecular packing order. The resulting photodetectors achieve an unprecedented detectivity&#160;over 1011 Jones from 0.4 to 1.5 &#181;m with a maximum of 1.68 &#215; 1012 Jones at 1.16 &#181;m under 0 V bias.








Abstract
The performance of organic photodetectors (OPDs) sensitive to the short&#8208;wavelength infrared (SWIR) light lags behind commercial indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) photodetectors primarily due to the scarcity of organic semiconductors with efficient photoelectric responses exceeding 1.3&#160;&#181;m. Limited by the Energy&#8208;gap law, ultralow&#8208;bandgap organic semiconductors usually suffer from severe non&#8208;radiative transitions, resulting in low external quantum efficiency (EQE). Herein, a difluoro&#8208;substituted quinoid terminal group (QC&#8208;2F) with exceptionally strong electron&#8208;negativity is developed for constructing a new non&#8208;fullerene acceptor (NFA), Y&#8208;QC4F with an ultralow bandgap of 0.83&#160;eV. This subtle structural modification significantly enhances intermolecular packing order and density, enabling an absorption onset up to 1.5&#160;&#181;m while suppressing non&#8208;radiation recombination in Y&#8208;QC4F films. SWIR OPDs based on Y&#8208;QC4F achieve an impressive detectivity (D*) over 1011 Jones from 0.4 to 1.5&#160;&#181;m under 0&#160;V bias, with a maximum of 1.68 &#215; 1012 Jones at 1.16&#160;&#181;m. Furthermore, the resulting OPDs demonstrate competitive performance with commercial photodetectors for high&#8208;quality SWIR imaging even under 1.4&#160;&#181;m irradiation.

The resulting photodetectors achieve an unprecedented detectivity&#160;over 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; Jones from 0.4 to 1.5 &#181;m with a maximum of 1.68 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; Jones at 1.16 &#181;m under 0 V bias.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The performance of organic photodetectors (OPDs) sensitive to the short-wavelength infrared (SWIR) light lags behind commercial indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) photodetectors primarily due to the scarcity of organic semiconductors with efficient photoelectric responses exceeding 1.3&#160;&#181;m. Limited by the Energy-gap law, ultralow-bandgap organic semiconductors usually suffer from severe non-radiative transitions, resulting in low external quantum efficiency (EQE). Herein, a difluoro-substituted quinoid terminal group (QC-2F) with exceptionally strong electron-negativity is developed for constructing a new non-fullerene acceptor (NFA), Y-QC4F with an ultralow bandgap of 0.83&#160;eV. This subtle structural modification significantly enhances intermolecular packing order and density, enabling an absorption onset up to 1.5&#160;&#181;m while suppressing non-radiation recombination in Y-QC4F films. SWIR OPDs based on Y-QC4F achieve an impressive detectivity (&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;*) over 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; Jones from 0.4 to 1.5&#160;&#181;m under 0&#160;V bias, with a maximum of 1.68 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; Jones at 1.16&#160;&#181;m. Furthermore, the resulting OPDs demonstrate competitive performance with commercial photodetectors for high-quality SWIR imaging even under 1.4&#160;&#181;m irradiation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Facilitating Oriented Dense Deposition: Utilizing Crystal Plane End&#8208;Capping Reagent to Construct Dendrite&#8208;Free and Highly Corrosion&#8208;Resistant (100) Crystal Plane Zinc Anode</title>

         <dc:description>
Oriented dense Zn anodes with high corrosion resistance are fabricated by introducing a Zn (100) crystal plane end&#8208;capping reagent into the electrolyte, which mitigates the dendrite growth and corrosive behavior of Zn anodes in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries and improves their durability. This study deepens the understanding of diverse Zn crystal planes and broadens the choice of crystal plane modulation.








Abstract
Dendrite growth and corrosion issues have significantly hindered the usability of Zn anodes, which further restricts the development of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). In this study, a zinc&#8208;philic and hydrophobic Zn (100) crystal plane end&#8208;capping reagent (ECR) is introduced into the electrolyte to address these challenges in AZIBs. Specifically, under the mediation of 100&#8208;ECR, the electroplated Zn configures oriented dense deposition of (100) crystal plane texture, which slows down the formation of dendrites. Furthermore, owing to the high corrosion resistance of the (100) crystal plane and the hydrophobic protective interface formed by the adsorbed ECR on the electrode surface, the Zn anode demonstrates enhanced reversibility and higher Coulombic efficiency in the modified electrolyte. Consequently, superior electrochemical performance is achieved through this novel crystal plane control strategy and interface protection technology. The Zn//VO2 cells based on the modified electrolyte maintained a high&#8208;capacity retention of &#8776;80.6% after 1350 cycles, corresponding to a low&#8208;capacity loss rate of only 0.014% per cycle. This study underscores the importance of deposition uniformity and corrosion resistance of crystal planes over their type. And through crystal plane engineering, a high&#8208;quality (100) crystal plane is constructed, thereby expanding the range of options for viable Zn anodes.

         <title>Strategically Modulating Proton Activity and Electric Double Layer Adsorption for Innovative All&#8208;Vanadium Aqueous Mn2+/Proton Hybrid Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel all&#8208;vanadium symmetric manganese ion batteries are developed for the first time based on tunnel&#8208;type monoclinic VO2 electrode materials. Through further rational electrolyte design and advanced multi&#8208;scale in situ characterization, the effective modulation of proton activity and electric double&#8208;layer structure at the interface is fully revealed and a unique mechanism of manganese ion/proton hybrid energy storage is demonstrated.








Abstract
Aqueous Mn&#8208;ion batteries (MIBs) exhibit a promising development potential due to their cost&#8208;effectiveness, high safety, and potential for high energy density. However, the development of MIBs is hindered by the lack of electrode materials capable of storing Mn2+ ions due to acidic manganese salt electrolytes and large ion radius. Herein, the tunnel&#8208;type structure of monoclinic VO2 nanorods to effectively store Mn2+ ions via a reversible (de)insertion chemistry for the first time is reported. Utilizing exhaustive in situ/ex situ multi&#8208;scale characterization techniques and theoretical calculations, the co&#8208;insertion process of Mn2+/proton is revealed, elucidating the capacity decay mechanism wherein high proton activity leads to irreversible dissolution loss of vanadium species. Further, the Grotthuss transfer mechanism of protons is broken via a hydrogen bond reconstruction strategy while achieving the modulation of the electric double&#8208;layer structure, which effectively suppresses the electrode interface proton activity. Consequently, the VO2 demonstrates excellent electrochemical performance at both ambient temperatures and &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C, especially maintaining a high capacity of 162&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 after a record&#8208;breaking 20&#160;000 cycles. Notably, the all&#8208;vanadium symmetric pouch cells are successfully assembled for the first time based on the &#8220;rocking&#8208;chair&#8221; Mn2+/proton hybrid mechanism, demonstrating the practical application potential.

         <dc:description>
A series of benzo[a]phenazine (BP)&#8208;based acceptors achieved through an isomerization chlorination strategy is presented, namely NA1, NA2, NA3, and NA4. The ortho&#8208;xylene (o&#8208;XY) processed binary organic solar cells (OSCs) based on PM6:NA3 yields an efficiency of 18.94%. Importantly, the o&#8208;XY processed ternary OSC device based on PM6:D18&#8208;Cl:NA3 exhibits an efficiency as high as 19.75%.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance organic solar cells often rely on halogen&#8208;containing solvents, which restrict the photovoltaic industry. Therefore, it is imperative to develop efficient organic photovoltaic materials compatible with halogen&#8208;free solvents. Herein, a series of benzo[a]phenazine (BP)&#8208;core&#8208;based small&#8208;molecule acceptors (SMAs) achieved through an isomerization chlorination strategy is presented, comprising unchlorinated NA1, 10&#8208;chlorine substituted NA2, 8&#8208;chlorine substituted NA3, and 7&#8208;chlorine substituted NA4. Theoretical simulations highlight NA3's superior orbit overlap length and tight molecular packing, attributed to interactions between the end group and BP unit. Furthermore, NA3 demonstrates dense 3D network structures and a record electronic coupling of 104.5 meV. These characteristics empower the ortho&#8208;xylene (o&#8208;XY) processed PM6:NA3 device with superior power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.94%, surpassing PM6:NA1 (15.34%), PM6:NA2 (7.18%), and PM6:NA4 (16.02%). Notably, the significantly lower PCE in the PM6:NA2 device is attributed to excessive self&#8208;aggregation characteristics of NA2 in o&#8208;XY. Importantly, the incorporation of D18&#8208;Cl into the PM6:NA3 binary blend enhances crystallographic ordering and increases the exciton diffusion length of the donor phase, resulting in a ternary device efficiency of 19.75% (certified as 19.39%). These findings underscore the significance of incorporating new electron&#8208;deficient units in the design of efficient SMAs tailored for environmentally benign solvent processing of OSCs.

         <title>Shape&#8208;Regulated Motion and Energy Conversion of Polyelectrolyte Membrane Actuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the shape&#8208;dependent motion and adaptive rotation of self&#8208;powered Marangoni actuators on the water surface. Among them, circular actuators show regular motion and passage properties that enable energy harvesting and wireless sensing for obstruction location in closed pipes.








Abstract
Smart actuators hold great potential in soft robotics and sensors, but their movement at the fluid interface is less understood and controlled, hindering their performances and applications in complicated fluids. Here an ethanol&#8208;containing polyelectrolyte actuator is prepared that demonstrates excellent actuating performance via the Marangoni effect. These actuators exhibit enduring (17&#160;min), repeatable (50 cycles), and autonomous motion on the water surface. More importantly, the motion of actuators are dependent on their shapes. Polygonal actuators with more edges exhibit round motion attached to walls of containers, while the actuators with few edges move randomly. On the basis of this property, the circular actuators can pass through pipe bends with S&#8208;shaped complex geometry. These unique advantages lend the actuators to successful applications in wireless sensing (standard 0&#8211;5&#160;V level signals) for locating obstructions inside invisible pipes and continuous energy harvesting (7700&#160;nC per cycle) for micro mechanical energy.

&lt;p&gt;This work reports the shape-dependent motion and adaptive rotation of self-powered Marangoni actuators on the water surface. Among them, circular actuators show regular motion and passage properties that enable energy harvesting and wireless sensing for obstruction location in closed pipes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smart actuators hold great potential in soft robotics and sensors, but their movement at the fluid interface is less understood and controlled, hindering their performances and applications in complicated fluids. Here an ethanol-containing polyelectrolyte actuator is prepared that demonstrates excellent actuating performance via the Marangoni effect. These actuators exhibit enduring (17&#160;min), repeatable (50 cycles), and autonomous motion on the water surface. More importantly, the motion of actuators are dependent on their shapes. Polygonal actuators with more edges exhibit round motion attached to walls of containers, while the actuators with few edges move randomly. On the basis of this property, the circular actuators can pass through pipe bends with S-shaped complex geometry. These unique advantages lend the actuators to successful applications in wireless sensing (standard 0&#8211;5&#160;V level signals) for locating obstructions inside invisible pipes and continuous energy harvesting (7700&#160;nC per cycle) for micro mechanical energy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sulfate Radical Based In Situ Vaccine Boosts Systemic Antitumor Immunity via Concurrent Activation of Necroptosis and STING Pathway</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sulfate radical based in situ vaccine (ISV) is developed by intercalating peroxydisulfate into manganese&#8208;layered double hydroxide nanoparticles. This ISV mediates advanced oxidation process in tumor microenvironment to produce SO4&#183;&#8722; that induces immunogenic necroptosis of tumor cells, and concurrently activates stimulator of interferon genes (STING)&#160;signaling pathway that augments immune cells maturation, leading to remarkable systemic T cell immunity against primary and distant/metastatic tumors.








Abstract
In situ vaccine (ISV) can provoke systemic anti&#8208;tumor immunity through the induction of immunogenic cell death (ICD). The development of ISV technology has been restricted by the limited and suboptimal ICD driven tumor antigen production which are currently relying on chemo&#8208;drugs, photo&#8208;/radio&#8208;sensitizers, oncolytic&#8208;virus and immunostimulatory agents. Herein, a sulfate radical (SO4&#183;&#8722;) based ISV is reported that accomplishes superior tumor immunotherapy dispense from conventional approaches. The ISV denoted as P&#8208;Mn&#8208;LDH is constructed by intercalating peroxydisulfate (PDS, a precursor of SO4&#183;&#8722;) into manganese layered double hydroxide nanoparticles (Mn&#8208;LDH). This design allows the stabilization of PDS under ambient condition, but triggers a Mn2+ mediated PDS decomposition in acidic tumor microenvironment (TME) to generate in situ SO4&#183;&#8722;. Importantly, it is found that the SO4&#183;&#8208; radicals not only effectively kill cancer cells, but also induce a necroptotic cell death pathway, leading to robust ICD signaling for eliciting adaptive immunity. Further, the P&#8208;Mn&#8208;LDH can activate the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway to further boost anti&#8208;tumor immunity. Collectively, the P&#8208;Mn&#8208;LDH based ISV exhibited potent activity in inhibiting tumor growth and lung metastasis. When combined with immune checkpoint inhibitor, significant inhibition of distant tumors is achieved. This study underpins the promise of SO4&#183;&#8208; based vaccine technology for cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Reviving Sodium Tunnel Oxide Cathodes Based on Structural Modulation and Sodium Compensation Strategy Toward Practical Sodium&#8208;Ion Cylindrical Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An internal and external synergistic modulation strategy is proposed to slove the problems of surface residual alkali, multiple voltage plateaus, and low initial charge specific capacity in the tunnel oxide cathode material (Na0.44MnO2). In addition, Prussian blue analog (PBA)&#8208;Na0.44Mn1&#8208;xTixO2 composites are designed to construct practical sodium&#8208;ion cylindrical battery with hard carbon anodes for the first time, which displays excellent electrochemical performance and promotes the commercialization of SIBs.








Abstract
As a typical tunnel oxide, Na0.44MnO2 features excellent electrochemical performance and outstanding structural stability, making it a promising cathode for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, it suffers from undesirable challenges such as surface residual alkali, multiple voltage plateaus, and low initial charge specific capacity. Herein, an internal and external synergistic modulation strategy is adopted by replacing part of the Mn with Ti to optimize the bulk phase and construct a Ti&#8208;containing epitaxial stabilization layer, resulting in reduced surface residual alkali, excellent Na+ transport kinetics and improved water/air stability. Specifically, the Na0.44Mn0.85Ti0.15O2 using water&#8208;soluble carboxymethyl cellulose as a binder can realize a capacity retention rate of 94.30% after 1,000 cycles at 2C, and excellent stability is further verified in kilogram large&#8208;up applications. In addition, taking advantage of the rich Na content in Prussian blue analog (PBA), PBA&#8208;Na0.44Mn1&#8208;xTixO2 composites are designed to compensate for the insufficient Na in the tunnel oxide and are matched with hard carbon to achieve the preparation of coin full cell and 18650 cylindrical battery with satisfactory electrochemical performance. This work enables the application of tunnel oxides cathode for SIBs in 18650 cylindrical batteries for the first time and promotes the commercialization of SIBs.

         <title>Evidence of Lone Pair Crafted Emphanisis in the Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Halide Perovskite Cs2PbI2Cl2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Emphanisis, or local symmetry reduction upon warming, in Cs2PbI2Cl2, is revealed by synchrotron X&#8208;ray total scattering analysis. Origin of emphanisis is traced to Pb 6s2 lone&#8208;pair&#8208;induced cooperative structural distortion, featuring thermally activated Pb off&#8208;centering and static Cl displacement. Insights from inelastic neutron scattering and theoretical studies shed light on impact of these distortions on the ultralow thermal conductivity of Cs2PbI2Cl2.








Abstract
A hallmark of typical structural transformations is an increase in symmetry upon heating due to entropic favourability. However, local symmetry breaking upon warming is recently evidenced in rare crystalline phases. Termed as emphanisis, the phenomenon implores exploration of fascinating thermodynamic nuances that drive unusual structural evolutions. Here, synchrotron X&#8208;ray total scattering measurements are presented on a Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper mixed halide perovskite, Cs2PbI2Cl2, which reveal signatures of emphanisis. The genesis of symmetry lowering upon heating is traced to a lone pair&#8208;driven cooperative local structural distortion composed of thermally actuated Pb off&#8208;centring and static Cl displacement. Mapping the thermal evolution of low&#8208;lying phonon modes with inelastic neutron scattering uncovers instances of mode hardening with picosecond lifetime and an intriguing soft mode at the X&#8208;point of the Brillouin zone&#8212;features conducive to ultralow thermal transport. Together, these observations highlight the fundamental and functional implications of chemical design in engendering unconventional phenomena in crystalline materials and associated properties.

         <title>Ultrastable Carboxyl&#8208;Functionalized Pore&#8208;Space&#8208;Partitioned Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A large family of carboxyl&#8208;functionalized MOFs with high porosity for gas separation have been synthesized. New Cr&#8208;MOFs are exceptionally stable in boiling water, extremely acidic (pH &lt; 0) or basic (pH &gt; 14) conditions and can be deprotonated and re&#8208;protonated following cycle of base&#8208;acid treatments, opening up applications under harsh conditions. New materials exhibit excellent adsorption properties such as high uptake capacity and promising separation performance for gas mixtures such as C2H2/CO2, C2H2/C2H4, and C6H6/C6H12.








Abstract
Isoreticular chemistry, which enables property optimization by changing compositions without changing topology, is a powerful synthetic strategy. One of the biggest challenges facing isoreticular chemistry is to extend it to ligands with strongly coordinating substituent groups such as unbound &#8722;COOH, because competitive interactions between such groups and metal ions can derail isoreticular chemistry. It is even more challenging to have an isoreticular series of carboxyl&#8208;functionalized MOFs capable of encompassing chemically disparate metal ions. Here, with the simultaneous introduction of carboxyl functionalization and pore space partition, a family of carboxyl&#8208;functionalized materials is developed in diverse compositions from homometallic Cr3+ and Ni2+ to heterometallic Co2+/V3+, Ni2+/V3+, Co2+/In3+, Co2+/Ni2+. Cr&#8208;MOFs remain highly crystalline in boiling water. Unprecedentedly, one Cr&#8208;MOF can withstand the treatment cycle with 10m NaOH and 12m HCl, allowing reversible inter&#8208;conversion between unbound &#8722;COOH acid form and &#8722;COO&#8722; base form. These materials exhibit excellent sorption properties such as high uptake capacity for CO2 (100.2 cm3&#160;g&#8722;1) and hydrocarbon gases (e.g., 142.1 cm3&#160;g&#8722;1 for C2H2, 110.5 cm3&#160;g&#8722;1 for C2H4) at 1 bar and 298K, high benzene/cyclohexane selectivity (up to &#8776;40), and promising separation performance for gas mixtures such as C2H2/CO2 and C2H2/C2H4.

     alt="Ultrastable Carboxyl-Functionalized Pore-Space-Partitioned Metal-Organic Frameworks for Gas Separation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large family of carboxyl-functionalized MOFs with high porosity for gas separation have been synthesized. New Cr-MOFs are exceptionally stable in boiling water, extremely acidic (pH &amp;lt; 0) or basic (pH &amp;gt; 14) conditions and can be deprotonated and re-protonated following cycle of base-acid treatments, opening up applications under harsh conditions. New materials exhibit excellent adsorption properties such as high uptake capacity and promising separation performance for gas mixtures such as C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isoreticular chemistry, which enables property optimization by changing compositions without changing topology, is a powerful synthetic strategy. One of the biggest challenges facing isoreticular chemistry is to extend it to ligands with strongly coordinating substituent groups such as unbound &#8722;COOH, because competitive interactions between such groups and metal ions can derail isoreticular chemistry. It is even more challenging to have an isoreticular series of carboxyl-functionalized MOFs capable of encompassing chemically disparate metal ions. Here, with the simultaneous introduction of carboxyl functionalization and pore space partition, a family of carboxyl-functionalized materials is developed in diverse compositions from homometallic Cr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to heterometallic Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/V&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/V&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/In&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. Cr-MOFs remain highly crystalline in boiling water. Unprecedentedly, one Cr-MOF can withstand the treatment cycle with 10&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; NaOH and 12&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; HCl, allowing reversible inter-conversion between unbound &#8722;COOH acid form and &#8722;COO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; base form. These materials exhibit excellent sorption properties such as high uptake capacity for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (100.2 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and hydrocarbon gases (e.g., 142.1 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 110.5 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) at 1 bar and 298K, high benzene/cyclohexane selectivity (up to &#8776;40), and promising separation performance for gas mixtures such as C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chiral Intranasal Nanovaccines as Antivirals for Respiratory Syncytial Virus</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>

Chiral intranasal vaccines are fabricated to target the Respiratory Syncytial Virus and promote the immunological response by controlling the composition, size, and chirality of the nanostructures.








Abstract
This study aimed to develop an intranasal nanovaccine by combining chiral nanoparticles with the RSV pre&#8208;fusion protein (RSV protein) to create L&#8208;nanovaccine (L&#8208;Vac). The results showed that L&#8208;NPs increased antigen attachment in the nasal cavity by 3.83 times and prolonged its retention time to 72&#160;h. In vivo experimental data demonstrated that the intranasal immunization with L&#8208;Vac induced a 4.86&#8208;fold increase in secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) secretion in the upper respiratory tract, a 1.85&#8208;fold increase in the lower respiratory tract, and a 20.61&#8208;fold increase in RSV&#8208;specific immunoglobin G (IgG) titer levels in serum, compared with the commercial Alum Vac, while the neutralizing activity against the RSV authentic virus is 1.66&#8208;fold higher. The mechanistic investigation revealed that L&#8208;Vac activated the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway in nasal epithelial cells (NECs), in turn increasing the expression levels of interleukin&#8208;6 (IL&#8208;6) and C&#8211;C motif chemokine ligand 20 (CCL20) by 1.67&#8208;fold and 3.46&#8208;fold, respectively, through the downstream nuclear factor kappa&#8208;B (NF&#8208;&#954;B) signaling pathway. Meanwhile, CCL20 recruited dendritic cells (DCs) and L&#8208;Vac activated the Toll&#8208;like receptor signaling pathway in DCs, promoting IL&#8208;6 expression and DCs maturation, and boosted sIgA production and T&#8208;cell responses. The findings suggested that L&#8208; Vac may serve as a candidate for the development of intranasal medicine against various types of respiratory infections.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells via In Situ Passivation Directed Crystallization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ passivation (ISP) method is introduced to adjust the crystal growth kinetics and obtain the (111)&#8208;orientated perovskite films with the passivated boundaries and interfaces, leading to high&#8208;performance inverted perovskite solar cells, with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 26.7% (certified as 26.09% at a 5.97 square millimeters active area).








Abstract
Lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as one of the influential photovoltaic technologies with promising cost&#8208;effectiveness. Though with mild processabilities to massive production, inverted PSCs have long suffered from inferior photovoltaic performances due to intractable defective states at boundaries and interfaces. Herein, an in situ passivation (ISP) method is presented to effectively adjust crystal growth kinetics and obtain the well&#8208;orientated perovskite films with the passivated boundaries and interfaces, successfully enabled the new access of high&#8208;performance inverted PSCs. The study unravels that the strong yet anisotropic ISP additive adsorption between different facets and the accompanied additive engineering yield the high&#8208;quality (111)&#8208;orientated perovskite crystallites with superior photovoltaic properties. The ISP&#8208;derived inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved remarkable power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 26.7% (certified as 26.09% at a 5.97 mm2 active area) and 24.5% (certified as 23.53% at a 1.28 cm2 active area), along with decent operational stabilities.

         <title>Aggregate&#8208;Dominated Dilute Electrolytes with Low&#8208;Temperature&#8208;Resistant Ion&#8208;Conducting Channels for Highly Reversible Na Plating/Stripping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2&#8208;methyltetrahydrofuran&#8208;based electrolyte is designed with weak dissociation of Na+&#8208;PF6&#8722; ion pairs and a highly efficient network for ultrafast Na+ hopping, which breaks through the LT ion&#8208;conducting limitation of conventional electrolytes. The methyl&#8208;regulated electronic structure induces gradient decomposition toward an inorganic&#8208;organic bilayer SEI with high Na+ mobility. A record&#8208;high CE beyond 99.9% is achieved even at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Developing rechargeable batteries with high power delivery at low temperatures (LT) below 0&#160;&#176;C is significant for cold&#8208;climate applications. Initial anode&#8208;free sodium metal batteries (AFSMBs) promise high LT performances because of the low de&#8208;solvation energy and smaller Stokes radius of Na+, nondiffusion&#8208;limited plating/stripping electrochemistry, and maximized energy density. However, the severe reduction in electrolyte ionic conductivity and formation of unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) hinder their practical applications at LT. In this study, a 2&#8208;methyltetrahydrofuran&#8208;based dilute electrolyte is designed to concurrently achieve an anion&#8208;coordinated solvation structure and impressive ionic conductivity of 3.58&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C. The dominant aggregate solvates enable the formation of highly efficient and LT&#8208;resistant Na+ hopping channels in the electrolyte. Moreover, the methyl&#8208;regulated electronic structure in 2&#8208;methyltetrahydrofuran induces gradient decomposition toward an inorganic&#8208;organic bilayer SEI with high Na+ mobility, composition homogeneity, and mechanical robustness. As such, a record&#8208;high Coulombic efficiency beyond 99.9% is achieved even at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C. The as&#8208;constructed AFSMBs sustain 300 cycles with 80% capacity maintained, and a 0.5&#8208;Ah level pouch cell delivers 85% capacity over 180 cycles at &#8722;25&#160;&#176;C. This study affords new insights into electrolyte formulation for fast ionic conduction and superior Na reversibility at ultralow temperatures.

A refined direct recycling process to improve cathode interface stability by leveraging in situ reaction between surface residual lithium species and a weak inorganic acid to form a conformal Li+ conductive coating stabilizes the regenerated Ni&#8208;rich cathodes with significantly reduced water footprint. This intensified recycling process offers a more sustainable approach with the potential to transition from laboratory to industrial&#8208;scale applications, improving both product quality and environmental sustainability.








Abstract
The burgeoning accumulation of spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), a byproduct from the widespread adoption of portable electronics and electric vehicles, necessitates efficient recycling strategies. Direct recycling represents a promising strategy to maximize the value of LIB waste and minimize harmful environmental outcomes. However, current efforts to large&#8208;scale direct recycling face challenges stemming from heterophase residues (e.g., Li2CO3, LiOH) in the recycled products and uncontrolled interfacial instability, often requiring repeated washing that generates significant wastewater. Here, a refined direct recycling process is proposed to improve cathode interface stability by leveraging in situ reaction between surface residual lithium species and a weak inorganic acid to form a conformal Li+ conductive coating that stabilizes the regenerated Ni&#8208;rich cathodes with significantly reduced water footprint. The findings reveal that the conductive coating also prevents direct contact between contaminants and the cathode surface, thus improving the ambient storage stability. By eliminating the need for extensive washing, this intensified recycling process offers a more sustainable approach with the potential to transition from laboratory to industrial&#8208;scale applications, improving both product quality and environmental sustainability.

         <title>Dynamic Control of Asymmetric Charge Distribution for Electrocatalytic Urea Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic catalytic system by precisely controlling the asymmetric charge density distribution in an Au&#8208;doped cpCu7CF catalyst is developed and successfully applied in regulating the multiple steps of sequential reactions in urea electrosynthesis.








Abstract
Constructing dual catalytic sites with charge density differences is an efficient way to promote urea electrosynthesis from parallel NO3&#8722;${\mathrm{NO}}_3^ - $ and CO2 reduction yet still challenging in static system. Herein, a dynamic system is constructed by precisely controlling the asymmetric charge density distribution in an Au&#8208;doped coplanar Cu7 clusters&#8208;based 3D framework&#160;catalyst (Au@cpCu7CF). In Au@cpCu7CF, the redistributed charge between Au and Cu atoms changed periodically with the application of pulse potentials switching between &#8722;0.2 and &#8722;0.6&#8201;V and greatly facilitated the electrosynthesis of urea. Compared with the static condition of pristine cpCu7CF (FEurea = 5.10%), the FEurea of Au@cpCu7CF under pulsed potentials is up to 55.53%. Theoretical calculations demonstrated that the high potential of &#8722;0.6&#160;V improved the adsorption of *HNO2 and *NH2 on Au atoms and inhibited the reaction pathways of by&#8208;products. While at the low potential of &#8722;0.2&#160;V, the charge distribution between Au and Cu atomic sites facilitated the thermodynamic C&#8211;N coupling step. This work demonstrated the important role of asymmetric charge distribution under dynamic regulation for urea electrosynthesis, providing a new inspiration for precise control of electrocatalysis.

         <title>Self&#8208;Growing Hydrogel Bioadhesives for Chronic Wound Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrogel bioadhesive patch, which is featured with a gradual increase in mechanics in an autonomous and self&#8208;growing manner is exploited for the chronic wound management through long&#8208;term yet dynamic mechanical modulation.








Abstract
Hydrogel bioadhesives have emerged as a promising alternative to wound dressings for chronic wound management. However, many existing bioadhesives do not meet the functional requirements for efficient wound management through dynamically mechanical modulation, due to the reduced wound contractibility, frequent wound recurrence, incapability to actively adapt to external microenvironment variation, especially for those gradually&#8208;expanded chronic wounds. Here, a self&#8208;growing hydrogel bioadhesive (sGHB) patch that exhibits instant adhesion to biological tissues but also a gradual increase in mechanical strength and interfacial adhesive strength within a 120&#8208;h application is presented. The gradually increased mechanics of the sGHB patch could effectively mitigate the stress concentration at the wound edge, and also resist the wound expansion at various stages, thus mechanically contracting the chronic wounds in a programmable manner. The self&#8208;growing hydrogel patch demonstrated enhanced wound healing efficacy in a mouse diabetic wound model, by regulating the inflammatory response, promoting the faster re&#8208;epithelialization and angiogenesis through mechanical modulation. Such kind of self&#8208;growing hydrogel bioadhesives have potential clinical utility for a variety of wound management where dynamic mechanical modulation is indispensable.

         <title>Sequential Targeted Enzyme&#8208;Instructed Self&#8208;Assembly Supramolecular Nanofibers to Attenuate Intervertebral Disc Degeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inflammatory cytokines and cellular senescence collectively contribute to the intervertebral disc degeneration. Enzyme&#8208;instructed self&#8208;assembly supramolecular nanofibers (Fbp&#8208;GFFYPLGLAG(E)nRGD) are developed to target the overexpression of two crucial enzymes, MMP&#8208;2 and COX&#8208;2. These nanofibers can effectively block the synergistic effect of the inflammatory cascade and aging&#8208;related secretion phenotype and reduce the extracellular matrix damage caused by inflammation and aging cell accumulation. Finally, it can mitigate the progression of disc degeneration.








Abstract
As an age&#8208;related disease, intervertebral disc degeneration is closely related to inflammation and aging. Inflammatory cytokines and cellular senescence collectively contribute to the degradation of intervertebral disc. Blocking this synergy reduces disc extracellular matrix damage caused by inflammation and aging. In this study, drug&#8208;loaded nanofibers with sequential targeting functions are constructed through intelligent response, hydrophilicity, and in situ self&#8208;assembly empowerment of flurbiprofen. The peptide precursor responds to the cleavage of overexpressed MMP&#8208;2 in the degenerative intervertebral disc microenvironment (intracellular and extracellular), resulting in the formation of self&#8208;assembled nanofibers that enable the on&#8208;demand release of flurbiprofen and COX&#8208;2 response. In vitro, Comp. 1 (Flurbiprofen&#8208;GFFYPLGLAGEEEERGD) reduces the expression of inflammation&#8208;related genes and proteins and the polarization of M1 macrophages by competitively inhibiting COX&#8208;2 and increases the expression of extracellular matrix proteins COL&#8208;2 and aggrecan. Additionally, it can reduce the expression of Senescence&#8208;Associated Secretory Phenotype and DNA damage in aged nucleus pulposus cells and promote the recovery of proliferation and cell cycle. In vivo, drug&#8208;loaded nanofibers delay intervertebral disc degeneration by inhibiting inflammation and preventing the accumulation of senescent cells. Therefore, the sequentially targeted self&#8208;assembled drug&#8208;loaded nanofibers can delay intervertebral disc degeneration by blocking the synergistic effect of inflammatory cytokines and cellular senescence.

         <title>Near 100% Conversion of Acetylene to High&#8208;purity Ethylene at Ampere&#8208;Level Current</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>

The delicately prepared CuO nanoribbons electrocatalyst with abundant vacancies exhibits superior electrocatalytic performance for the semi&#8208;hydrogenation of C2H2 to C2H4 in the C2H2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 flow cell and Zn&#8208;C2H2 battery. The integrated system achieves near 100% C2H2 conversion and higher than 96.1% C2H4 specific selectivity, generating polymer&#8208;grade C2H4 products.








Abstract
Direct production of high&#8208;purity ethylene from acetylene using renewable energy through electrocatalytic semi&#8208;hydrogenation presents a promising alternative to traditional thermocatalytic processes. However, the low conversion of acetylene results in a significant amount of acetylene impurities in the product, necessitating additional purification steps. Herein, a tandem electrocatalytic system that integrates acetylene electrolyzer and zinc&#8208;acetylene battery units for high&#8208;purity ethylene production is designed. The ultrathin CuO nanoribbons with enriched oxygen vacancies (CuO1&#8208;x NRs) as electrocatalysts achieve a remarkable 93.2% Faradaic efficiency of ethylene at an ampere&#8208;level current density of 1.0&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 in an acetylene electrolyzer, and the power density reaches 3.8&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2 in a zinc&#8208;acetylene battery under acetylene stream. Moreover, the tandem electrocatalysis system delivers a single&#8208;pass acetylene conversion of 99.998% and ethylene selectivity of 96.1% at a high current of 1.4&#160;A. Experimental data and calculations demonstrate that the presence of oxygen vacancies accelerates water dissociation to produce active hydrogen atoms while preventing the over&#8208;hydrogenation of ethylene. Furthermore, techno&#8208;economic analysis reveals that the tandem system can dramatically reduce the overall ethylene production cost compared to the conventional thermocatalytic processes. A novel strategy for complete acetylene&#8208;to&#8208;ethylene conversion under mild conditions, establishing a non&#8208;petroleum route for the production of ethylene is reported.

&lt;p&gt;The delicately prepared CuO nanoribbons electrocatalyst with abundant vacancies exhibits superior electrocatalytic performance for the semi-hydrogenation of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; in the C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; flow cell and Zn-C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; battery. The integrated system achieves near 100% C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion and higher than 96.1% C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; specific selectivity, generating polymer-grade C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; products.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Direct production of high-purity ethylene from acetylene using renewable energy through electrocatalytic semi-hydrogenation presents a promising alternative to traditional thermocatalytic processes. However, the low conversion of acetylene results in a significant amount of acetylene impurities in the product, necessitating additional purification steps. Herein, a tandem electrocatalytic system that integrates acetylene electrolyzer and zinc-acetylene battery units for high-purity ethylene production is designed. The ultrathin CuO nanoribbons with enriched oxygen vacancies (CuO&lt;sub&gt;1-x&lt;/sub&gt; NRs) as electrocatalysts achieve a remarkable 93.2% Faradaic efficiency of ethylene at an ampere-level current density of 1.0&#160;A&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in an acetylene electrolyzer, and the power density reaches 3.8&#160;mW&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in a zinc-acetylene battery under acetylene stream. Moreover, the tandem electrocatalysis system delivers a single-pass acetylene conversion of 99.998% and ethylene selectivity of 96.1% at a high current of 1.4&#160;A. Experimental data and calculations demonstrate that the presence of oxygen vacancies accelerates water dissociation to produce active hydrogen atoms while preventing the over-hydrogenation of ethylene. Furthermore, techno-economic analysis reveals that the tandem system can dramatically reduce the overall ethylene production cost compared to the conventional thermocatalytic processes. A novel strategy for complete acetylene-to-ethylene conversion under mild conditions, establishing a non-petroleum route for the production of ethylene is reported.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Local Dipole Modulation Toward High Fill Factor in Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Local dipole modulation in organic solar cells can significantly enhance device performance. By adjusting molecular asymmetries, two non&#8208;fullerene acceptors, AA&#8208;1 and AA&#8208;2 are synthesized. The unidirectional asymmetry in AA&#8208;2 led to an improved balanced charge transport, resulting in an exceptional fill factor of 0.830 and a power conversion efficiency of 18.3%.








Abstract
Dipole moment arrangement in organic semiconductors plays a critical role in affecting the intermolecular packing, determining optoelectronic properties and device performance. Here, to get the desired fill factor (FF) values in organic solar cells (OSCs), the local dipole of non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs) is modulated by changing the molecular asymmetries. Two NFAs, AA&#8208;1 and AA&#8208;2 are designed and synthesized, which have different substitutions of alkyl and alkoxyl groups. The unidirectional asymmetry in AA&#8208;2 creates distinct local dipoles, while the bidirectional asymmetry in AA&#8208;1 mitigates dipole variation. Despite the minimal impact on monomolecular properties, the local dipole moment significantly influences terminal group packing modes in the film state. This, in turn, enhances the relative dielectric constant, prolongs exciton lifetime, and reduces sub&#8208;bandgap defect states. Consequently, PBDB&#8208;TF:AA&#8208;2&#8208;based OSCs achieve an exceptional FF of 0.830 and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.3%, with a ternary device reaching a PCE of 19.3%. This work highlights the potential of dipole modulation in material design to get ideal FF values for high&#8208;performance OSCs.

         <title>Constructing Multiscale Fibrous Morphology to Achieve 20% Efficiency Organic Solar Cells by Mixing High and Low Molecular Weight D18</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
MIX&#8208;D18, by mixing HW&#8208;D18 (high molecular weight D18) and LW&#8208;D18 (low molecular weight D18), can form multiscale fibrous morphology. The finer nanofibers of HW&#8208;D18 can increase Donor/Acceptor contact, enhancing exciton dissociation and collection efficiency, while the thicker nanofibers of LW&#8208;D18 can improve crystallinity and boost charge transport capability. Ultimately, a efficiency of 20.0% is achieved by MIX&#8208;D18:L8&#8208;BO device.








Abstract
This study underscores the significance of precisely manipulating the morphology of the active layer in organic solar cells (OSCs). By blending polymer donors of D18 with varying molecular weights, a multiscale interpenetrating fiber network structure within the active layer is successfully created. The introduction of 10% low molecular weight D18 (LW&#8208;D18) into high molecular weight D18 (HW&#8208;D18) produces MIX&#8208;D18, which exhibits an extended exciton diffusion distance and orderly molecular stacking. Devices utilizing MIX&#8208;D18 demonstrate superior electron and hole transport, improves exciton dissociation, enhances charge collection efficiency, and reduces trap&#8208;assisted recombination compared to the other two materials. Through the use of the nonfullerene acceptor L8&#8208;BO, a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.0% is achieved. This methodology, which integrates the favorable attributes of high and low molecular weight polymers, opens a new avenue for enhancing the performance of OSCs.

         <title>Extracellular Vesicles from Nanomedicine&#8208;Trained Intestinal Microbiota Substitute for Fecal Microbiota Transplant in Treating Ulcerative Colitis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>

Gut microbiota from CN@Lp127&#8208;trained healthy mice secrete extracellular vesicles (Gm&#8208;EVs) that regulate intestinal microbiota, colonic immune environment, and purine metabolism. These Gm&#8208;EVs significantly improve the treatment outcomes against ulcerative colitis by reducing inflammation, restoring colonic barrier function, and rebalancing intestinal microbiota, offering an alternative to fecal microbiota transplant.








Abstract
The biosafety concerns associated with fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) limit their clinical application in treating ulcerative colitis (UC). Gut microbiota secrete abundant extracellular vesicles (Gm&#8208;EVs), which play a critical role in bacteria&#8208;to&#8208;bacteria and bacteria&#8208;to&#8208;host communications. Herein, intestinal microbiota are trained using tea leaf lipid/pluronic F127&#8208;coated curcumin nanocrystals (CN@Lp127s), which can maintain stability during transit through the gastrointestinal tract. Compared with FMT, Gm&#8208;EVs derived from healthy mice significantly improve treatment outcomes against UC by reducing colonic inflammatory responses, restoring colonic barrier function, and rebalancing intestinal microbiota. Strikingly, Gm&#8208;EVs obtained from CN@Lp127&#8208;trained healthy mice exhibit a superior therapeutic effect on UC compared to groups receiving FMT from healthy mice, Gm&#8208;EVs from healthy mice, and FMT from CN@Lp127&#8208;trained healthy mice. Oral administration of Gm&#8208;EVs from CN@Lp127&#8208;trained healthy mice not only alleviates colonic inflammation, promotes mucosal repair, and regulates gut microbiota but also regulates purine metabolism to decrease the uric acid level, resulting in a robust improvement in the UC. This study demonstrates the UC therapeutic efficacy of Gm&#8208;EVs derived from nanomedicine&#8208;trained gut microbiota in regulating the immune microenvironment, microbiota, and purine metabolism of the colon. These EVs provide an alternative platform to replace FMT as a treatment for UC.

         <title>Bottom Contact Engineering for Ambient Fabrication of &gt;25% Durable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sodium gluconate (SG) is used to disperse tin oxide (SnO2) nanoparticles (NPs) in order to create a uniform SG&#8208;SnO2 film and control the buried interface. This allows for the deposition of perovskite films with nearly pinhole&#8208;free at the bottom contact interface in ambient air. The SG&#8208;SnO2 PSCs achieved an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.34% (certified as 25.17%). Additionally, these PSCs retained around 90% of their initial PCE after 1000 h of operation (T90 = 1000&#160;h). Microstructure analysis revealed that light&#8208;induced degradation primarily occurred at the buried holes, so SG&#8208;SnO2 PSCs enhance light stability by suppressing the formation of holes at the buried interface.








Abstract
The bottom contact in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is easy to cause deep trap states and severe instability issues, especially under maximum power point tracking (MPPT). In this study, sodium gluconate (SG) is employed to disperse tin oxide (SnO2) nanoparticles (NPs) and regulate the interface contact at the buried interface. The SG&#8208;SnO2 electron transfer layer (ETL) enabled the deposition of pinhole&#8208;free perovskite films in ambient air and improved interface contact by bridging effect. SG&#8208;SnO2 PSCs achieved an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.34% (certified as 25.17%) with a high open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) exceeding 1.19&#160;V. The VOC loss is less than 0.34&#160;V relative to the 1.53&#160;eV bandgap, and the fill factor (FF) loss is only 2.02% due to the improved contact. The SG&#8208;SnO2 PSCs retained around 90% of their initial PCEs after 1000&#160;h operation (T90 = 1000&#160;h), higher than T80 = 1000&#160;h for the control SnO2 PSC. Microstructure analysis revealed that light&#8208;induced degradation primarily occurred at the buried holes and grain boundaries and highlighted the importance of bottom&#8208;contact engineering.

Additionally, these PSCs retained around 90% of their initial PCE after 1000 h of operation (T&lt;sub&gt;90&lt;/sub&gt; = 1000&#160;h). Microstructure analysis revealed that light-induced degradation primarily occurred at the buried holes, so SG-SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; PSCs enhance light stability by suppressing the formation of holes at the buried interface.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom contact in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is easy to cause deep trap states and severe instability issues, especially under maximum power point tracking (MPPT). In this study, sodium gluconate (SG) is employed to disperse tin oxide (SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) nanoparticles (NPs) and regulate the interface contact at the buried interface. The SG-SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electron transfer layer (ETL) enabled the deposition of pinhole-free perovskite films in ambient air and improved interface contact by bridging effect. SG-SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; PSCs achieved an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.34% (certified as 25.17%) with a high open-circuit voltage (&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;) exceeding 1.19&#160;V. The &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt; loss is less than 0.34&#160;V relative to the 1.53&#160;eV bandgap, and the fill factor (FF) loss is only 2.02% due to the improved contact. The SG-SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; PSCs retained around 90% of their initial PCEs after 1000&#160;h operation (T&lt;sub&gt;90&lt;/sub&gt; = 1000&#160;h), higher than T&lt;sub&gt;80&lt;/sub&gt; = 1000&#160;h for the control SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; PSC. Microstructure analysis revealed that light-induced degradation primarily occurred at the buried holes and grain boundaries and highlighted the importance of bottom-contact engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enabling Stable Operation of Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries under Fast&#8208;Operating Conditions by Tuning the Electrolyte Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorinated ester&#8208;based fast&#8208;charging electrolytes (FCEs) facilitate an exceptional lifespan of 3000 cycles at charge rates of as high as 4 C with 0&#8211;100% state&#8208;of&#8208;charge in commercial 1 Ah graphite|LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 pouch cells. The superior performance is due to the well&#8208;tuned solvation structure, enhanced solvent solvation ability, and ameliorated electrode&#8211;electrolyte interphase chemistry.








Abstract
Inferior fast&#8208;charging and low&#8208;temperature performances remain a hurdle for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Overcoming this hurdle is extremely challenging primarily due to the low conductivity of commercial ethylene carbonate (EC)&#8208;based electrolytes and the formation of undesirable solid electrolyte interphases with poor Li+&#8208;ion diffusion kinetics. Here, a series of EC&#8208;free fast&#8208;charging electrolytes (FCEs) by incorporating a fluorinated ester, methyl trifluoroacetate (MTFA), as a special cosolvent into a practically viable LiPF6&#8211;dimethyl carbonate&#8211;fluoroethylene carbonate system, is reported. With a solvent&#8208;dominated solvation structure, MTFA facilitates the formation of thin, yet robust, interphases on both the cathode and anode. Commercial 1 Ah graphite|LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 pouch cells filled with the FCE exhibit &#8776;80% capacity retention over 3000 cycles at 3 C and 4 C (15&#160;min) charging rates in the full range of 0&#8211;100% state&#8208;of&#8208;charge. Moreover, even at a low operating temperature of &#8722;20 &#176;C, the 1 Ah cell retains a high capacity of 0.65 Ah at a 2 C discharge rate and displays virtually no capacity fade on cycling at a C/5 rate. The work highlights the power of electrolyte design in achieving extra&#8208;fast&#8208;charging and low&#8208;temperature performances.

         <title>General Design of Aligned&#8208;Channel Porous Carbon Electrodes for Efficient High&#8208;Current&#8208;Density Gas&#8208;Evolving Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of aligned&#8208;channel carbon electrodes by a general design strategy are developed, which not only facilitates the fast accessibility of liquid reactants and the timely detachment of gaseous products but also possesses a large pore area to accommodate abundant active sites, thus achieving high&#8208;performance gas&#8208;evolving electrocatalysis at high current densities, including urea oxidation reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, and hydrogen evolution reaction.








Abstract
Gas&#8208;evolving reactions (GERs) are important in many electrochemical energy conversion technologies and chemical industries. The operation of GERs at high current densities is critical for their industrial implementation but remains challenging as it poses stringent requirements on the electrodes in terms of reaction kinetics, mass transfer, and electron transport. Here the general and rational design of self&#8208;standing carbon electrodes with vertically aligned porous channels, appropriate pore size distribution, and high surface area as supports for loading a variety of catalytic species by facile electrodeposition are reported. These electrodes simultaneously possess high intrinsic activity, large numbers of active sites, and efficient transport highways for ions, gases, and electrons, resulting in significant performance improvements at high current densities in diverse GERs such as urea oxidation, hydrogen evolution, and oxygen evolution reactions, as well as overall urea/water electrolyzers. As an example, the carbon electrode decorated with Ni(OH)2 demonstrates a record&#8208;high current density of 1000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 1.360&#160;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode, largely outperforming the conventional nickel foam&#8208;based counterpart and the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrodes.

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Indium Oxide Electrochemical Sensor for Stable and Selective NO2 Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study pioneers the use of nonprecious metal electrochemical sensing materials, specifically nitrided In2O3, for NO2 detection. The In2O3 N&#8208;40 min sensor exhibits a robust response (771 nA to 10 ppm NO2), exceptional stability (&gt;30 days), and rapid recovery (5/16 s), outperforming Pt/C with 63 times higher selectivity and 98% longer stability.








Abstract
Efficient gas sensors are critical for environmental monitoring and industrial safety. While metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) sensors are cost&#8208;effective, they struggle with poor selectivity, high operating temperatures, and limited stability. Electrochemical sensors, though selective and energy&#8208;efficient, face high costs, and stability issues due to precious metal catalysts like platinum on carbon (Pt/C). Herein, a novel, cost&#8208;effective electrochemical sensor using nitrogen&#8208;doped indium oxide In2O3&#8722;xN2x/3Vx/3 (0.01&#8804;x&#8804;0.14), synthesized with varying nitriding times is presented. The optimized In2O3 N&#8208;40&#160;min sensor demonstrates a remarkable response current of 771 nA to 10&#160;ppm nitrogen dioxide (NO2) at ambient temperature, with outstanding long&#8208;term stability (over 30 days) and rapid response/recovery times (5/16 s). Compared to Pt/C sensors, it shows 84% and 67% reductions in response and recovery times, respectively, and maintains 98% performance after a month, versus 68% for Pt/C. This cost&#8208;effective sensor presents a promising alternative for electrochemical gas sensing, eliminating the need for precious metal catalysts.

         <title>Targeting the Labile Iron Pool with Engineered DFO Nanosheets to Inhibit Ferroptosis for Parkinson's Disease Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An engineered DFO&#8208;nanosheets based multifunctional nanoregulator with sequential targeting and ROS&#8208;responsive release property is developed for targeting ferroptosis mitigate dopaminergic neuron degeneration in Parkinson's disease through regulating labile iron pool&#8208;mediated iron metabolism, suppressing lipid peroxidation&#8208;mediated reduction of GPX4 expression, and improving mitochondrial dysfunction.








Abstract
Ferroptosis in neurons is considered one of the key factors that induces Parkinson's disease (PD), which is caused by excessive iron accumulation in the intracellular labile iron pool (LIP). The iron ions released from the LIP lead to the aberrant generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to trigger ferroptosis and exacerbate PD progression. Herein, a pioneering design of multifunctional nanoregulator deferoxamine (DFO)&#8208;integrated nanosheets (BDPR NSs) is presented that target the LIP to restrict ferroptosis and protect against PD. The BDPR NSs are constructed by incorporating a brain&#8208;targeting peptide and DFO into polydopamine&#8208;modified black phosphorus nanosheets. These BDPR NSs can sequester free iron ions, thereby ameliorating LIP overload and regulating iron metabolism. Furthermore, the BDPR NSs can decrease lipid peroxidation generation by mitigating ROS accumulation. More importantly, BDPR NSs can specifically accumulate in the mitochondria to suppress ROS generation and decrease mitochondrial iron accumulation. In vivo experiments demonstrated that the BDPR NSs highly efficiently mitigated dopaminergic neuronloss and its associated behavioral disorders by modulating the LIP and inhibiting ferroptosis. Thus, the BDPR&#8208;based nanovectors holds promise as a potential avenue for advancing PD therapy.

&lt;p&gt;An engineered DFO-nanosheets based multifunctional nanoregulator with sequential targeting and ROS-responsive release property is developed for targeting ferroptosis mitigate dopaminergic neuron degeneration in Parkinson's disease through regulating labile iron pool-mediated iron metabolism, suppressing lipid peroxidation-mediated reduction of GPX4 expression, and improving mitochondrial dysfunction.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferroptosis in neurons is considered one of the key factors that induces Parkinson's disease (PD), which is caused by excessive iron accumulation in the intracellular labile iron pool (LIP). The iron ions released from the LIP lead to the aberrant generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to trigger ferroptosis and exacerbate PD progression. Herein, a pioneering design of multifunctional nanoregulator deferoxamine (DFO)-integrated nanosheets (BDPR NSs) is presented that target the LIP to restrict ferroptosis and protect against PD. The BDPR NSs are constructed by incorporating a brain-targeting peptide and DFO into polydopamine-modified black phosphorus nanosheets. These BDPR NSs can sequester free iron ions, thereby ameliorating LIP overload and regulating iron metabolism. Furthermore, the BDPR NSs can decrease lipid peroxidation generation by mitigating ROS accumulation. More importantly, BDPR NSs can specifically accumulate in the mitochondria to suppress ROS generation and decrease mitochondrial iron accumulation. In vivo experiments demonstrated that the BDPR NSs highly efficiently mitigated dopaminergic neuronloss and its associated behavioral disorders by modulating the LIP and inhibiting ferroptosis. Thus, the BDPR-based nanovectors holds promise as a potential avenue for advancing PD therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polymeric Nanocarriers Autonomously Cross the Plant Cell Wall and Enable Protein Delivery for Stress Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cationic high aspect ratio polymeric nanocarrier is developed to deliver functional protein in crops to enable species&#8208;independent plant engineering. The delivered sensor protein reduction&#8208;oxidation sensitive green fluorescent protein (roGFP) successfully monitors stressors in tobacco, tomato, and maize. This functional protein delivery platform paves the way for new technologies in plant sensing and engineering, contributing to the design of new solutions that promote plant&#8208;based sustainable development.








Abstract
Delivery of proteins in plant cells can facilitate the design of desired functions by modulation of biological processes and plant traits but is currently limited by narrow host range, tissue damage, and poor scalability. Physical barriers in plants, including cell walls and membranes, limit protein delivery to desired plant tissues. Herein, a cationic high aspect ratio polymeric nanocarriers (PNCs) platform is developed to enable efficient protein delivery to plants. The cationic nature of PNCs binds proteins through electrostatic. The ability to precisely design PNCs&#8217; size and aspect ratio allowed us to find a cutoff of &#8776;14&#160;nm in the cell wall, below which cationic PNCs can autonomously overcome the barrier and carry their cargo into plant cells. To exploit these findings, a reduction&#8208;oxidation sensitive green fluorescent protein (roGFP) is deployed as a stress sensor protein cargo in a model plant Nicotiana benthamiana and common crop plants, including tomato and maize. In vivo imaging of PNC&#8208;roGFP enabled optical monitoring of plant response to wounding, biotic, and heat stressors. These results show that PNCs can be precisely designed below the size exclusion limit of cell walls to overcome current limitations in protein delivery to plants and facilitate species&#8208;independent plant engineering.

         <title>Stabilization of Cu&#948;+ Sites Within MnO2 for Superior Urea Electro&#8208;Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>

A typical Cu&#8208;doped MnO2 (Cu&#8208;MnO2) with stable Cu&#948;+&#8208;oxygen vacancies (Ovs)&#8208;Mn3+ dual site (Cu&#948;+&#8208;Ovs&#8208;Mn3+) achieves a remarkable Faradaic efficiency (FE) and urea yield rate in electrocatalytic CO2/NO3&#8722; reduction with a highest yield rate of 116.7&#160;mmol&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;gcat.&#8722;1 in a flow cell. Mechanistic studies reveal that such stabilized Cu&#948;+ sites kinetically lower the energy barrier of C&#8208;N coupling.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic C&#8208;N coupling between NO3&#8208; and CO2 has emerged as a sustainable route for urea production. However, identifying catalytic active sites and designing efficient electrocatalysts remain significant challenges. Herein, the synthesis of Cu&#8208;doped MnO2 nanotube (denoted as Cu&#8208;MnO2) with stable Cu&#948;+&#8208;oxygen vacancies (Ovs)&#8208;Mn3+ dual sites is reported. Compared with pure MnO2, Cu&#948;+ doping can effectively enhance urea production performance in the co&#8208;reduction of CO2 and NO3&#8208;. Thus, Cu&#8208;MnO2 catalyst exhibits a maximum Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 54.7% and the highest yield rate of 116.7&#160;mmol&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;gcat.&#8722;1 in a flow cell. Remarkably, the urea yield rate remains over 78&#160;mmol&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;gcat.&#8722;1 across a wide potential range. Further experimental and theoretical results elucidate the unique role of Cu&#8208;MnO2 solid&#8208;solution for stabilizing Cu&#948;+ sites in Cu&#948;+&#8208;Ovs&#8208;Mn3+, endowing the catalyst with superior structural and electrochemical stabilities. This thermodynamically promotes urea formation and kinetically lowers the energy barrier of C&#8208;N coupling.

         <title>Substrate Induced p&#8211;n Transition for Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substrate&#8208;induced re&#8208;growth strategy is proposed to induce p&#8208; to n&#8208;transition of perovskite surface. Bulk perovskite grows on ITO/P3CT&#8208;N and shows p&#8208;type, while its surface re&#8208;grows on ITO/SnO2 and transits to n&#8208;type, introducing an interfacial junction. Resulting inverted perovskite solar cells exhibit &gt;25% efficiency with good stability, retaining 90% of initial efficiency after MPP tracking for 800&#160;h at 65&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
The p&#8208; or n&#8208;type property of semiconductor materials directly determine the final performance of photoelectronic devices. Generally, perovskite deposited on p&#8208;type substrate tends to be p&#8208;type, while perovskite deposited on n&#8208;type substrate tends to be n&#8208;type. Motived by this, a substrate&#8208;induced re&#8208;growth strategy is reported to induce p&#8208; to n&#8208;transition of perovskite surface in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). p&#8208;type perovskite film is obtained and crystallized on p&#8208;type substrate first. Then an n&#8208;type ITO/SnO2 substrate with saturated perovskite solution is pressed onto the perovskite film and annealed to induce the secondary re&#8208;growth of perovskite surface region. As a result, p&#8208; to n&#8208;type transition happens and induces an extra junction at perovskite surface region, thus enhancing the built&#8208;in potential and promoting carrier extraction in PSCs. Resulting inverted PSCs exhibit high efficiency of over 25% with good operational stability, retaining 90% of initial efficiency after maximum power point (MPP) tracking for 800&#160;h at 65&#160;&#176;C with ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;2 protocol.

         <title>Identifying Highly Active and Selective Cobalt X&#8208;Ides for Electrocatalytic Hydrogenation of Quinoline</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A group of Co X&#8208;ides are adopted as the models to investigate the catalytic behavior differences toward the electrocatalytic hydrogenation of quinoline (ECHQ). The Co3O4 undergoes an ideal 1,4/2,3&#8208;H* addition pathway and presents the best conversion and selectivity toward ECHQ. The key enhanced mechanism of Co3O4 toward ECHQ is demonstrated to be closely&#160;related to its favorable interfacial water adsorption and the spontaneous desorption of product.








Abstract
Earth&#8208;abundant Co X&#8208;ides are emerging as promising catalysts for the electrocatalytic hydrogenation of quinoline (ECHQ), yet challenging due to the limited fundamental understanding of ECHQ mechanism on Co X&#8208;ides. This work identifies the catalytic performance differences of Co X&#8208;ides in ECHQ and provides significant insights into the catalytic mechanism of ECHQ. Among selected Co X&#8208;ides, the Co3O4 presents the best ECHQ performance with a high conversion of 98.2% and 100% selectivity at ambient conditions. The Co3O4 sites present a higher proportion of 2&#8208;coordinated hydrogen&#8208;bonded water at the interface than other Co X&#8208;ides at a low negative potential, which enhances the kinetics of subsequent water dissociation to produce H*. An ideal 1,4/2,3&#8208;H* addition pathway on Co3O4 surface with a spontaneous desorption of 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinoline is demonstrated through operando tracing and theoretical calculations. In comparison, the Co9S8 sites display the lowest ECHQ performance due to the high thermodynamic barrier in the H* formation step, which suppresses subsequent hydrogenation; while the ECHQ on Co(OH)F and CoP sites undergo the 1,2,3,4&#8208; and 4,3/1,2&#8208;H* addition pathway respectively with the high desorption barriers and thus low conversion of quinoline. Moreover, the Co3O4 presents a wide substrate scope and allows excellent conversion of other quinoline derivatives and N&#8208;heterocyclic substrates.

     alt="Identifying Highly Active and Selective Cobalt X-Ides for Electrocatalytic Hydrogenation of Quinoline"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group of Co X-ides are adopted as the models to investigate the catalytic behavior differences toward the electrocatalytic hydrogenation of quinoline (ECHQ). The Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; undergoes an ideal 1,4/2,3-H* addition pathway and presents the best conversion and selectivity toward ECHQ. The key enhanced mechanism of Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; toward ECHQ is demonstrated to be closely&#160;related to its favorable interfacial water adsorption and the spontaneous desorption of product.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earth-abundant Co X-ides are emerging as promising catalysts for the electrocatalytic hydrogenation of quinoline (ECHQ), yet challenging due to the limited fundamental understanding of ECHQ mechanism on Co X-ides. This work identifies the catalytic performance differences of Co X-ides in ECHQ and provides significant insights into the catalytic mechanism of ECHQ. Among selected Co X-ides, the Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; presents the best ECHQ performance with a high conversion of 98.2% and 100% selectivity at ambient conditions. The Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; sites present a higher proportion of 2-coordinated hydrogen-bonded water at the interface than other Co X-ides at a low negative potential, which enhances the kinetics of subsequent water dissociation to produce H*. An ideal 1,4/2,3-H* addition pathway on Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; surface with a spontaneous desorption of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline is demonstrated through operando tracing and theoretical calculations. In comparison, the Co&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; sites display the lowest ECHQ performance due to the high thermodynamic barrier in the H* formation step, which suppresses subsequent hydrogenation; while the ECHQ on Co(OH)F and CoP sites undergo the 1,2,3,4- and 4,3/1,2-H* addition pathway respectively with the high desorption barriers and thus low conversion of quinoline. Moreover, the Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; presents a wide substrate scope and allows excellent conversion of other quinoline derivatives and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heterocyclic substrates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unveiling the Reaction Mystery Between Lithium Polysulfides and Lithium Metal Anode in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction mystery of the reaction between lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and Li metal is revealed. Lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfony)imide (LiTFSI) slowly reacts with Li metal to form a SO42&#8722;&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). LiPSs react rapidly with Li metal to form a Li2S&#8208;rich SEI with poor stability. Lithium nitrate (LiNO3) modulates the solvation structure of LiPSs to inherently suppress the reactivity of LiPSs and improves the Li anode stability.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries are widely regarded as one of the most promising next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density energy storage devices. However, soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) corrode Li metal and deteriorate the cycling stability of Li&#8211;S batteries. Understanding the reaction mechanism between LiPSs and Li metal anode is imperative. Herein, the reaction rate and products of LiPSs with Li metal anode, the composition and structure of the as&#8208;generated solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), and the mechanism of lithium nitrate (LiNO3) additives for inhibiting the corrosion reactions are systematically unveiled. Concretely, LiPSs react with Li metal anode more rapidly than Li salt and generate a Li2S&#8208;rich SEI. The Li2S&#8208;rich SEI is highly reactive with LiPSs, which exacerbates the formation of dendritic Li and the continuous corrosion of active Li. LiNO3 functions dominantly by modulating the solvation structure of LiPSs and inherently reducing the reactivity of LiPSs, rather than the conventional understanding of LiNO3 participating in the formation of SEI. This work reveals the reaction mechanism between LiPSs and Li metal anode and inspires rational regulating of the solvation structure of LiPSs for stabilizing Li metal anode in Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Enhancing the Electrical Conductivity and Long&#8208;Term Stability of PEDOT:PSS Electrodes through Sequential Treatment with Nitric Acid and Cesium Chloride</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conductivity of sub&#8208;20&#8208;nm thin poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) films is improved by treating them sequentially with HNO3 and CsCl. The resulting layers show enhanced crystallinity with electrical conductivity of up to 5500 S cm&#8722;1, with 85% of this value being retained after 270 d of storage in ambient air at room temperature without being encapsulated.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processable poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is an important polymeric conductor used extensively in organic flexible, wearable, and stretchable optoelectronics. However, further enhancing its conductivity and long&#8208;term stability while maintaining its superb mechanical properties remains challenging. Here, a novel post&#8208;treatment approach to enhance the electrical properties and stability of sub&#8208;20&#8208;nm&#8208;thin PEDOT:PSS films processed from solution is introduced. The approach involves a sequential post&#8208;treatment with HNO3 and CsCl, resulting in a remarkable enhancement of the electrical conductivity of PEDOT:PSS films to over 5500 S cm&#8722;1, along with improved carrier mobility. The post&#8208;treated films exhibit remarkable air stability, retaining over 85% of their initial conductivity even after 270 days of storage. Various characterization techniques, including X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, Hall effect measurements, and grazing incidence wide angle X&#8208;ray scattering, coupled with density functional theory calculations, provide insights into the structural changes and interactions responsible for these improvements. To demonstrate the potential for practical applications, the ultrathin PEDOT:PSS films are connected to an inorganic light&#8208;emitting diode with a battery, showcasing their suitability as transparent electrodes. This work presents a promising approach for enhancing the electrical conductivity of PEDOT:PSS while offering a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms that can guide further advances.

         <title>Bubble&#8208;Guidance Breaking Gas Shield for Highly Efficient Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy to break the gas shield by an anisotropic groove&#8208;micro/nanostructured porous electrode (GMPE) is demonstrated for achieving high&#8208;efficiency electrolytic water splitting. Gradient groove&#8208;micro/nanostructures on the GMPE serve as high&#8208;speed bubble form, transport, and detach channels, and exhibit superior bubble&#8208;guidance capabilities, which cooperatively improve mass transfer.








Abstract
Overall water splitting is a promising technology for sustainable hydrogen production, but the primary challenge is removing bubbles from the electrode surface quickly to increase hydrogen production. Inspired by the directional fluid transport properties of natural biological surfaces like Nepenthes peristome and Morpho butterfly's wings, here a strategy is demonstrated to achieve highly efficient overall water splitting by a bubble&#8208;guidance electrode, that is, an anisotropic groove&#8208;micro/nanostructured porous electrode (GMPE). Gradient groove micro/nanostructures on the GMPE serve as high&#8208;speed bubble transmission channels and exhibit superior bubble&#8208;guidance capabilities. The synergistic effect of the asymmetric Laplace pressure generated between microscale porous structure and groove patterns and the buoyancy along the groove patterns pushes the produced bubbles directionally to spread, transport, and detach from the electrode surface in time. Moreover, the low adhesive nanosheet arrays are beneficial to reduce bubble size and increase bubble release frequency, which cooperatively improve mass transfer with the microscale structure. Notably, GMPE outperforms planar&#8208;micro/nanostructured porous electrode (PMPE) in hydrogen/oxygen evolution reactions, with GMPE||GMPE showing better water splitting performance than commercially available RuO2||20 wt.% Pt/C. This work improves electrodes for better mass transfer and kinetics in electrochemical reactions at solid&#8208;liquid&#8208;gas interfaces, offering insight for designing and preparing gas&#8208;involved photoelectrochemical electrodes.

         <title>Monolithic DNApatite: An Elastic Apatite with Sub&#8208;Nanometer Scale Organo&#8211;Inorganic Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel realization of an elastic&#8208;ceramic material, featuring &#8216;deoxyribonucleic apatite (DNApatite),&#8217; is newly synthesized, incorporating both ceramic (hydroxyapatite, HA) and polymeric (single&#8208;stranded DNA, ssDNA) elements at a sub&#8208;nm scale to overcome the limits of conventional ceramic materials. This novel non&#8208;composite material achieves synergistic effects from the combination of different material types, namely ceramic and polymer without additional phosphate ion.








Abstract
Hydroxyapatite (HA) exhibits outstanding biocompatibility, bioactivity, osteoconductivity, and natural anti&#8208;inflammatory properties. Pure HA, ion&#8208;doped HA, and HA&#8208;polymer composites are investigated, but&#160;critical limitations such as brittleness remain; numerous efforts are being made to address them. Herein, the novel self&#8208;crystallization of a polymeric single&#8208;stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (ssDNA) without additional phosphate ions for synthesizing deoxyribonucleic apatite (DNApatite) is presented. The synthesized DNApatite, DNA1Ca2.2(PO4)1.3OH2.1, has a repetitive dual phase of inorganic HA crystals and amorphous organic ssDNA at the sub&#8208;nm scale, forming nanorods. Its mechanical properties, including toughness and elasticity, are significantly enhanced compared with those of HA nanorod, with a Young's modulus similar to that of natural bone.

&lt;p&gt;The novel realization of an elastic-ceramic material, featuring &#8216;deoxyribonucleic apatite (DNApatite),&#8217; is newly synthesized, incorporating both ceramic (hydroxyapatite, HA) and polymeric (single-stranded DNA, ssDNA) elements at a sub-nm scale to overcome the limits of conventional ceramic materials. This novel non-composite material achieves synergistic effects from the combination of different material types, namely ceramic and polymer without additional phosphate ion.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Weak Polarization&#8208;Strain Coupling Effect Boosts Capacitive Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
As the service electric field for MLCCs in pulsed circuit systems increases, electrostrain&#8208;induced vibration has become a critical failure mechanism. By employing a polarization&#8208;strain weak coupling strategy, the electrostriction coefficient of the relaxor dielectrics is significantly suppressed. This mitigation reduces the breakdown risk, enhancing the stability, performance, and lifespan of MLCCs.








Abstract
In pulse power systems, multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs) encounter significant challenges due to the heightened loading electric field (E), which can lead to fatigue damage and ultrasonic concussion caused by electrostrictive strain. To address these issues, an innovative strategy focused on achieving an ultra&#8208;weak polarization&#8208;strain coupling effect is proposed, which effectively reduces strain in MLCCs. Remarkably, an ultra&#8208;low electrostrictive coefficient (Q33) of 0.012 m4 C&#8722;2 is achieved in the composition 0.55(Bi0.5Na0.5)TiO3&#8208;0.45Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3, resulting in a significantly reduced strain of 0.118% at 330&#160;kV cm&#8722;1. At the atomic scale, the local structural heterogeneity leads to an expanded and loose lattice structure, providing ample space for large ionic displacement polarization instead of lattice stretching when subjected to the applied E. This unique behavior not only promotes energy storage performance (ESP) but also accounts for the observed ultra&#8208;low Q33 and strain. Consequently, the MLCC device exhibits an impressive energy storage density of 14.6 J cm&#8722;3 and an ultrahigh efficiency of 93% at 720&#160;kV cm&#8722;1. Furthermore, the superior ESP of the MLCC demonstrates excellent fatigue resistance and temperature stability, making it a promising solution for practical applications. Overall, this pivotal strategy offers a cost&#8208;effective solution for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art MLCCs with ultra&#8208;low strain&#8208;vibration in pulse power systems.

         <title>Ruthenium Single&#8208;Atom Modulated Protonated Iridium Oxide for Acidic Water Oxidation in Proton Exchange Membrane Electrolysers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protonated iridium oxides, known for their durability in acidic water oxidation, have limited intrinsic catalytic performance. This study demonstrates that incorporating Ru single atoms and oxygen vacancies within the Ir&#9472;O lattice can optimize oxygen intermediate binding and stabilize Ir active sites, significantly enhancing both catalytic activity and stability, leading to a highly efficient electrocatalyst in proton exchange membrane water electrolysers.








Abstract
Proton exchange membrane water electrolysers promise to usher in a new era of clean energy, but they remain a formidable obstacle in designing active and durable electrocatalysts for the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this study, a protonated iridium oxide embedded with single&#8208;atom dispersed ruthenium atoms (H3.8Ir1&#8722;xRuxO4) that demonstrates exceptional activity and stability in acidic water oxidation is introduced. The single Ru dopants favorably induce localized oxygen vacancies in the Ir&#9472;O lattice, synergistically strengthening the adsorption of OOH* intermediates and enhancing the intrinsic OER activity. In addition, the preferential oxidation of Ru and the electronegativity of the oxygen vacancies significantly stabilize the Ir&#9472;O active sites, improving the OER stability. Consequently, the H3.8Ir1&#9472;xRuxO4 catalyst shows an overpotential of 255&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and displays exceptional catalytic endurance in acidic electrolytes, surpassing 1100 h, representing a remarkable one&#8208;order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude increase in stability compared to that of pristine H3.8IrO4. A proton exchange membrane electrolyser utilizing the H3.8Ir1&#8722;xRuxO4 catalyst as an anode exhibits stable performance for more than 1280 h under a high current density of 2 A cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Modulating the Electronic Structure of Cobalt&#8208;Vanadium Bimetal Catalysts for High&#8208;Stable Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolyzer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electronic structures of Co&#8208;V bimetallic electrocatalyst are precisely modulated by nitrogen and phosphate anions to enhance hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reaction, respectively, significantly promoting the performance of anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer.








Abstract
Modulating the electronic structure of catalysts to effectively couple the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is essential for developing high&#8208;efficiency anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE). Herein, a coral&#8208;like nanoarray composed of nanosheets through the synergistic layering effect of cobalt and the 1D guiding of vanadium is synthesized, which promotes extensive contact between the active sites and electrolyte. The HER and OER activities can be enhanced by modulating the electronic structure through nitridation and phosphorization, respectively, enhancing the strength of metal&#8208;H bond to optimize hydrogen adsorption and facilitating the proton transfer to improve the transformation of oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates. Resultantly, the AEMWE achieves a current density of 500 mA cm&#8211;2 at 1.76 V for 1000 h in 1.0 M KOH at 70&#160;&#176;C. The energy consumption is 4.21 kWh Nm&#8211;3 with the producing hydrogen cost of $0.93 per kg H2. Operando synchrotron radiation and Bode phase angle analyses reveal that during the high&#8208;energy consumed OER, the dissolution of vanadium species transforms distorted Co&#8722;O octahedral into regular octahedral structures, accompanied by a shortening of the Co&#8722;Co bond length. This structural evolution facilitates the formation of oxygen intermediates, thus accelerating the reaction kinetics.

The first highly efficient permeable and stretchable monolithic hybrid tribo&#8208;piezo&#8208;electromagnetic nanogenerator&#8208;based electronic skin is developed, by adopting a fairly facile and scalable design of two&#8208;layer porous topological insulator&#8208;piezoelectric polymer composite nanofibers sandwiching liquid metal networks. It works not only as an efficient epidermal power source but also as a multifunctional self&#8208;powered sensor.








Abstract
Escalating energy demands of self&#8208;independent on&#8208;skin/wearable electronics impose challenges on corresponding power sources to offer greater power density, permeability, and stretchability. Here, a high&#8208;efficient breathable and stretchable monolithic hybrid triboelectric&#8208;piezoelectric&#8208;electromagnetic nanogenerator&#8208;based electronic skin (TPEG&#8208;skin) is reported via sandwiching a liquid metal mesh with two&#8208;layer topological insulator&#8208;piezoelectric polymer composite nanofibers. TPEG&#8208;skin concurrently extracts biomechanical energy (from body motions) and electromagnetic radiations (from adjacent appliances), operating as epidermal power sources and whole&#8208;body self&#8208;powered sensors. Topological insulators with conductive surface states supply notably enhanced triboelectric and piezoelectric effects, endowing TPEG&#8208;skin with a 288&#160;V output voltage (10 N, 4&#160;Hz), &#8764;3 times that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art devices. Liquid metal meshes serve as breathable electrodes and extract ambient electromagnetic pollution (&#177;60&#160;V, &#177;1.6&#160;&#181;A cm&#8722;2). TPEG&#8208;skin implements self&#8208;powered physiological and body motion monitoring and system&#8208;level human&#8208;machine interactions. This study provides compatible energy strategies for on&#8208;skin/wearable electronics with high power density, monolithic device integration, and multifunctionality.

&lt;p&gt;Escalating energy demands of self-independent on-skin/wearable electronics impose challenges on corresponding power sources to offer greater power density, permeability, and stretchability. Here, a high-efficient breathable and stretchable monolithic hybrid triboelectric-piezoelectric-electromagnetic nanogenerator-based electronic skin (TPEG-skin) is reported via sandwiching a liquid metal mesh with two-layer topological insulator-piezoelectric polymer composite nanofibers. TPEG-skin concurrently extracts biomechanical energy (from body motions) and electromagnetic radiations (from adjacent appliances), operating as epidermal power sources and whole-body self-powered sensors.

Hybrid Biointerface Engineering
In article number 2401495, Wei Tao, Sicen Wang, Xiaoyu Xie, and co&#8208;workers present a novel biointerface&#8208;engineered hybrid nanovesicle (P&#8208;I@M1E/AAL), achieved by integrating M1&#8208;like macrophage&#8208;derived exosomes with AS1411 aptamer&#8208;conjugated liposomes. The designed P&#8208;I@M1E/AAL nanoplatform combines multiple treatment modalities, offering a promising therapeutic approach to overcome the challenges of the hypoxic and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. By reprogramming tumor&#8208;associated macrophages and enhancing tumor&#8208;targeted photodynamic&#8208;immunotherapy, this platform shows significant potential for improving anti&#8208;tumor treatment outcomes.

Ultrastrong Soft Pneumatic Actuation
In article number 2403954, Yang Qu, Wei Tang, Jun Zou, and co&#8208;workers have developed an ultra&#8208;strong pneumatic source enabled by programmable chemical reactions. By integrating thermoelectric materials and &#8220;pre&#8208;programming strategy&#8221; into the management of reversible reactions, a soft pneumatic actuation is realized with high regulation, high pressure, and the ability to transport gas over long distances. The soft pneumatic actuation is successfully applied to soft assistive wearables, haptic devices, and sightseeing car lifting.

Proximal High&#8208;Index Metamaterials from Gold Nanohexagons
Plasmonic nanoparticles, when arranged into periodic structures known as superlattices, can form metamaterials capable of manipulating light&#8208;matter interactions. In article number 2405650, Gi&#8208;Ra Yi and co&#8208;workers demonstrate the large&#8208;scale fabrication of a planar plasmonic superlattice composed of edge&#8208;to&#8208;edge assembled gold nanohexagons with precisely controlled gap proximities. The resulting metamaterial exhibits unprecedentedly high refractive index values in the near&#8208;infrared spectrum, surpassing the refractive index limits of naturally occurring materials.

siRNA co&#8208;Delivery
With a novel identified target of cancer&#8208;associated fibroblast&#8208;derived microfibrillar&#8208;associated protein 5 (MFAP&#8208;5), ABC&#8208;triblock copolymer based multicompartment polyion complex micelle (PICM) deliver siRNA against MFAP&#8208;5 and the cationic amphiphilic drug desloratadine simultaneously. The codelivery of desloratadine facilitates intracellular siRNA delivery, resulting in knockdown of MFAP&#8208;5 and significantly reduce tumor burden in a mice model of hepatocellular carcinoma. More details can be found in article number 2404784 by Heyang Zhang, Leonard Kaps, Matthias Barz, and co&#8208;workers.

         <title>Innovative Formulation Platform: Paving the Way for Superior Protein Therapeutics with Enhanced Efficacy and Broadened Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein therapeutics hold great promise for treating various diseases, yet their delivery remains challenging. This review introduces &#8220;Pcapsulation,&#8221; a protein formulation technology. Specifically, this review details the material design and summarizes the applications of formulated proteins across metabolic disorders, cancer, infectious diseases, and nervous system diseases. Perspectives on the future directions of protein delivery are also discussed.








Abstract
Protein therapeutics offer high therapeutic potency and specificity; the broader adoptions and development of protein therapeutics, however, have been constricted by their intrinsic limitations such as inadequate stability, immunogenicity, suboptimal pharmacokinetics and biodistribution, and off&#8208;target effects. This review describes a platform technology that formulates individual protein molecules with a thin formulation layer of crosslinked polymers, which confers the protein therapeutics with high activity, enhanced stability, controlled release capability, reduced immunogenicity, improved pharmacokinetics and biodistribution, and ability to cross the blood brain barriers. Based on currently approved protein therapeutics, this formulating platform affords the development of a vast family of superior protein therapeutics with improved efficacy and broadened indications at significantly reduced cost.

         <title>In&#8208;Depth Understanding of Interfacial Na+ Behaviors in Sodium Metal Anode: Migration, Desolvation, and Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review systematically discusses the interfacial Na+ migration, desolvation, and deposition behaviors of sodium&#8208;metal anode in terms of fundamental understanding, influencing factors and optimization strategies, anode&#8208;free sodium&#8208;metal batteries, advanced characterization techniques, etc.








Abstract
Interfacial Na+ behaviors of sodium (Na) anode severely threaten the stability of sodium&#8208;metal batteries (SMBs). This review systematically and in&#8208;depth discusses the current fundamental understanding of interfacial Na+ behaviors in SMBs including Na+ migration, desolvation, diffusion, nucleation, and deposition. The key influencing factors and optimization strategies of these behaviors are further summarized and discussed. More importantly, the high&#8208;energy&#8208;density anode&#8208;free sodium metal batteries (AFSMBs) are highlighted by addressing key issues in the areas of limited Na sources and irreversible Na loss. Simultaneously, recent advanced characterization techniques for deeper insights into interfacial Na+ deposition behavior and composition information of SEI film are spotlighted to provide guidance for the advancement of SMBs and AFSMBs. Finally, the prominent perspectives are presented to guide and promote the development of SMBs and AFSMBs.

&lt;p&gt;Interfacial Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; behaviors of sodium (Na) anode severely threaten the stability of sodium-metal batteries (SMBs). This review systematically and in-depth discusses the current fundamental understanding of interfacial Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; behaviors in SMBs including Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; migration, desolvation, diffusion, nucleation, and deposition. The key influencing factors and optimization strategies of these behaviors are further summarized and discussed. More importantly, the high-energy-density anode-free sodium metal batteries (AFSMBs) are highlighted by addressing key issues in the areas of limited Na sources and irreversible Na loss. Simultaneously, recent advanced characterization techniques for deeper insights into interfacial Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; deposition behavior and composition information of SEI film are spotlighted to provide guidance for the advancement of SMBs and AFSMBs. Finally, the prominent perspectives are presented to guide and promote the development of SMBs and AFSMBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Recent Advances in Antimony Selenide Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review reports recent advances in Sb2Se3 photodetectors (PDs), focusing on fundamental characteristics, nanostructure tuning, applications in heart rate monitoring, and monolithic integrated matrix imaging. The challenges, including the broadening of the detection range, the reduction of dark current, and the potential applications of flexible devices are highlighted, which provide a valuable reference for Sb2Se3 PDs and expand application areas.








Abstract
Photodetectors (PDs) rapidly capture optical signals and convert them into electrical signals, making them indispensable in a variety of applications including imaging, optical communication, remote sensing, and biological detection. Recently, antimony selenide (Sb2Se3) has achieved remarkable progress due to its earth&#8208;abundant, low toxicity, low price, suitable bandgap width, high absorption coefficient, and unique structural characteristics. Sb2Se3 has been extensively studied in solar cells, but there's a lack of timely updates in the field of PDs. A literature review based on Sb2Se3 PDs is urgently warranted. This review aims to provide a concise understanding of the latest progress in Sb2Se3 PDs, with a focus on the basic characteristics and the performance optimization for Sb2Se3 photoconductive&#8208;type and photodiode&#8208;type detectors, including nanostructure regulation, process optimization, and stability improvement of flexible devices. Furthermore, the application progresses of Sb2Se3 PDs in heart rate monitoring, and monolithic&#8208;integrated matrix images are introduced. Finally, this review presents various strategies with potential and feasibility to address challenges for the rapid development and commercial application of Sb2Se3 PDs.

         <title>Asymmetric Microenvironment Tailoring Strategies of Atomically Dispersed Dual&#8208;Site Catalysts for Oxygen Reduction and CO2 Reduction Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work first presents the frequently&#8208;used experimental synthesis and characterization methods of dual&#8208;atom catalysts. Then, four synergistic catalytic mechanisms, including cascade, assistance, co&#8208;adsorption and bifunction mechanisms, are summarized. The emphasis is placed on four asymmetric microenvironment modulating strategies, including active site asymmetric strategy, transverse/axial&#8208;modification engineering, distance engineering and strain engineering, and their effects on oxygen/carbon dioxide reduction reaction.








Abstract
Dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) with atomically dispersed dual&#8208;sites, as an extension of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), have recently become a new hot topic in heterogeneous catalysis due to their maximized atom efficiency and dual&#8208;site diverse synergy, because the synergistic diversity of dual&#8208;sites achieved by asymmetric microenvironment tailoring can efficiently boost the catalytic activity by optimizing the electronic structure of DACs. Here, this work first summarizes the frequently&#8208;used experimental synthesis and characterization methods of DACs. Then, four synergistic catalytic mechanisms (cascade mechanism, assistance mechanism, co&#8208;adsorption mechanism and bifunction mechanism) and four key modulating methods (active site asymmetric strategy, transverse/axial&#8208;modification engineering, distance engineering and strain engineering) are elaborated comprehensively. The emphasis is placed on the effects of asymmetric microenvironment of DACs on oxygen/carbon dioxide reduction reaction. Finally, some perspectives and outlooks are also addressed. In short, the review summarizes a useful asymmetric microenvironment tailoring strategy to speed up synthesis of high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts for different reactions.

         <title>The Reinforced Separation of Intractable Gas Mixtures by Using Porous Adsorbents</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Given the broad range of intractable gas mixtures, it is urgently necessitated to summarize the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art porous adsorbents used in this field. Herein, the review systematically summarizes the recent advancements in inorganic small molecules and light hydrocarbon separation, categorizes their separation modes, highlights the functionalization strategies of materials, and finally provides new insights into the structure&#8208;activity relationships and future challenges.








Abstract
This review focuses on the mechanism and driving force in the intractable gas separation using porous adsorbents. A variety of intractable mixtures have been discussed, including air separation, carbon capture, and hydrocarbon purification. Moreover, the separation systems are categorized according to distinctly biased modes depending on the minor differences in the kinetic diameter, dipole/quadruple moment, and polarizability of the adsorbates, or sorted by the varied separation occasions (e.g., CO2 capture from flue gas or air) and driving forces (thermodynamic and kinetic separation, molecular sieving). Each section highlights the functionalization strategies for porous materials, like synthesis condition optimization and organic group modifications for porous carbon materials, cation exchange and heteroatom doping for zeolites, and metal node&#8208;organic ligand adjustments for MOFs. These functionalization strategies are subsequently associated with enhanced adsorption performances (capacity, selectivity, structural/thermal stability, moisture resistance, etc.) toward the analog gas mixtures. Finally, this review also discusses future challenges and prospects for using porous materials in intractable gas separation. Therein, the combination of theoretical calculation with the synthesis condition and adsorption parameters optimization of porous adsorbents may have great potential, given its fast targeting of candidate adsorbents and deeper insights into the adsorption forces in the confined pores and cages.

         <title>Scalable Atomic Arrays for Spin&#8208;Based Quantum Computers in Silicon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>Ion&#8208;implanted silicon donor spin qubits afford exceptional quantum performance and show promise for the maturation to powerful quantum computers using standard semiconductor industry processes. This study presents a comprehensive technological suite for the scalable deterministic construction of donor&#8208;based qubit and qudit arrays that could be used as quantum processor architectures.








Abstract
Semiconductor spin qubits combine excellent quantum performance with the prospect of manufacturing quantum devices using industry&#8208;standard metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (MOS) processes. This applies also to ion&#8208;implanted donor spins, which further afford exceptional coherence times and large Hilbert space dimension in their nuclear spin. Here multiple strategies are demonstrated and integrated to manufacture scale&#8208;up donor&#8208;based quantum computers. 31PF2 molecule implants are used to triple the placement certainty compared to 31P ions, while attaining 99.99% confidence in detecting the implant. Similar confidence is retained by implanting heavier atoms such as 123Sb and 209Bi, which represent high&#8208;dimensional qudits for quantum information processing, while Sb2 molecules enable deterministic formation of closely&#8208;spaced qudits. The deterministic formation of regular arrays of donor atoms with 300&#160;nm spacing is demonstrated, using step&#8208;and&#8208;repeat implantation through a nano aperture. These methods cover the full gamut of technological requirements for the construction of donor&#8208;based quantum computers in silicon.

     alt="Scalable Atomic Arrays for Spin-Based Quantum Computers in Silicon"/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ion-implanted silicon donor spin qubits afford exceptional quantum performance and show promise for the maturation to powerful quantum computers using standard semiconductor industry processes. This study presents a comprehensive technological suite for the scalable deterministic construction of donor-based qubit and qudit arrays that could be used as quantum processor architectures.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Semiconductor spin qubits combine excellent quantum performance with the prospect of manufacturing quantum devices using industry-standard metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) processes. This applies also to ion-implanted donor spins, which further afford exceptional coherence times and large Hilbert space dimension in their nuclear spin. Here multiple strategies are demonstrated and integrated to manufacture scale-up donor-based quantum computers. &lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;PF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule implants are used to triple the placement certainty compared to &lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;P ions, while attaining 99.99% confidence in detecting the implant. Similar confidence is retained by implanting heavier atoms such as &lt;sup&gt;123&lt;/sup&gt;Sb and &lt;sup&gt;209&lt;/sup&gt;Bi, which represent high-dimensional qudits for quantum information processing, while Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules enable deterministic formation of closely-spaced qudits. The deterministic formation of regular arrays of donor atoms with 300&#160;nm spacing is demonstrated, using step-and-repeat implantation through a nano aperture.

         <title>Ionic Covalent Organic Framework Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionic covalent organic frameworks (ICOFs) are porous and crystalline materials with ionic moieties installed on the backbone. They can conduct ions selectively, rapidly, and reliably. Recent efforts to improve ionic conductivity, lower manufacturing cost, and reduce contact resistance will enable nicely balanced ICOF electrolytes for the next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries.








Abstract
Rechargeable secondary batteries, widely used in modern technology, are essential for mobile and consumer electronic devices and energy storage applications. Lithium (Li)&#8208;ion batteries are currently the most popular choice due to their decent energy density. However, the increasing demand for higher energy density has led to the development of Li metal batteries (LMBs). Despite their potential, the commonly used liquid electrolyte&#8208;based LMBs present serious safety concerns, such as dendrite growth and the risk of fire and explosion. To address these issues, using solid&#8208;state electrolytes in batteries has emerged as a promising solution. In this Perspective, recent advancements are discussed in ionic covalent organic framework (ICOFs)&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolytes, identify current challenges in the field, and propose future research directions. Highly crystalline ion conductors with polymeric versatility show promise as the next&#8208;generation solid&#8208;state electrolytes. Specifically, the use of anionic or cationic COFs is examined for Li&#8208;based batteries, highlight the high interfacial resistance caused by the intrinsic brittleness of crystalline ICOFs as the main limitation, and presents innovative ideas for developing all&#8208; and quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries using ICOF&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolytes. With these considerations and further developments, the potential for ICOFs is optimistic about enabling the realization of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density all&#8208;solid&#8208;state LMBs.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Sheet&#8208;Type Sulfide All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries Enabled by Dual&#8208;Function Li4.4Si Alloy&#8208;Modified Nano Silicon Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regarding the large&#8208;scale fabrication of sulfide all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs), silicon anode and thin free&#8208;standing sulfide electrolyte membranes are employed simultaneously toward potentially practical application. Dual&#8208;function Li4.4Si modified nSi anode sheets are developed, in which Li4.4Si serves a dual role by not only providing additional Li+ but also stabilizing the anode structure with its low Young's modulus upon cycling.








Abstract
The silicon&#8208;based anodes are one of the promising anodes to achieve the high energy density of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs). Nano silicon (nSi) is considered as a suitable anode material for assembling sheet&#8208;type sulfide ASSBs using thin free&#8208;standing Li6PS5Cl (LPSC) membrane without causing short circuit. However, nSi anodes face a significant challenge in terms of rapid capacity degradation during cycling. To address this issue, dual&#8208;function Li4.4Si modified nSi anode sheets are developed, in which Li4.4Si serves a dual role by not only providing additional Li+ but also stabilizing the anode structure with its low Young's modulus upon cycling. Sheet&#8208;type ASSBs equipped with the Li4.4Si modified nSi anode, thin LPSC membrane, and LiNi0.83Co0.11Mn0.06O2 (NCM811) cathode demonstrate exceptional cycle stability, with a capacity retention of 96.16% at 0.5 C (1.18&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) after 100 cycles and maintain stability for 400 cycles. Furthermore, a remarkable cell&#8208;level energy density of 303.9&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 is achieved at a high loading of 5.22 mAh cm&#8722;2, representing a leading level of sulfide ASSBs using electrolyte membranes at room temperature. Consequently, the chemically stable slurry process implemented in the fabrication of Li4.4Si&#8208;modified nSi anode sheet paves the way for scalable applications of high&#8208;performance sulfide ASSBs.

         <title>On the Topotactic Phase Transition Achieving Superconducting Infinite&#8208;Layer Nickelates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of many new complex oxides involves topotactic reduction&#8212;a process used to alter electronic structure through the removal of specific oxygen ions. The reaction can be damaging to the crystal lattice, however, and little is known about the reduction process in ultrathin films. Li et&#160;al. observed the reaction in situ using synchrotron X&#8208;ray methods to probe formation of the superconducting nickelate, Nd0.8 Sr0.2NiO2, providing key insights into the nature of the phase transition.








Abstract
Topotactic reduction is critical to a wealth of phase transitions of current interest, including synthesis of the superconducting nickelate Nd0.8Sr0.2NiO2, reduced from the initial Nd0.8Sr0.2NiO3/SrTiO3 heterostructure. Due to the highly sensitive and often damaging nature of the topotactic reduction, however, only a handful of research groups have been able to reproduce the superconductivity results. A series of in situ synchrotron&#8208;based investigations reveal that this is due to the necessary formation of an initial, ultrathin layer at the Nd0.8Sr0.2NiO3 surface that helps to mediate the introduction of hydrogen into the film such that apical oxygens are first removed from the Nd0.8Sr0.2NiO3 / SrTiO3 (001) interface and delivered into the reducing environment. This allows the square&#8208;planar / perovskite interface to stabilize and propagate from the bottom to the top of the film without the formation of interphase defects. Importantly, neither geometric rotations in the square planar structure nor significant incorporation of hydrogen within the films is detected, obviating its need for superconductivity. These findings unveil the structural basis underlying the transformation pathway and provide important guidance on achieving the superconducting phase in reduced nickelate&#160;systems.

A series of in situ synchrotron-based investigations reveal that this is due to the necessary formation of an initial, ultrathin layer at the Nd&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Sr&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;NiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; surface that helps to mediate the introduction of hydrogen into the film such that apical oxygens are first removed from the Nd&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Sr&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;NiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; / SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (001) interface and delivered into the reducing environment. This allows the square-planar / perovskite interface to stabilize and propagate from the bottom to the top of the film without the formation of interphase defects. Importantly, neither geometric rotations in the square planar structure nor significant incorporation of hydrogen within the films is detected, obviating its need for superconductivity. These findings unveil the structural basis underlying the transformation pathway and provide important guidance on achieving the superconducting phase in reduced nickelate&#160;systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Functional Thermoplastic Polyurethane Elastomers with &#945;, &#969;&#8208;Hydroxyl End&#8208;Functionalized Polyacrylates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) is developed by integrating &#945;,&#969;&#8208;hydroxyl terminal&#8208;functionalized polyacrylate into the soft segment of traditional polyether polyol. This TPU exhibits exceptional toughness and self&#8208;healing properties, making it unique among standard TPUs. Furthermore, the inclusion of photo&#8208;crosslinkable moiety in the polyacrylate polyol has&#160;successfully demonstrated the first TPU that combines superior elastomeric qualities with photopatterning capabilities.








Abstract
Thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) is an essential class of materials for demanding applications, from soft robotics and electronics to medical devices and batteries. However, traditional TPU development is primarily relied on specific soft segments, such as polyether, polyester, and polycarbonate polyols. Here, a novel method is introduced for developing TPU elastomers with enhanced performance and superior functionalities compared to conventional TPUs, achieved through the use of &#945;,&#969;&#8208;hydroxyl end&#8208;functionalized polyacrylates. This approach involves a defect&#8208;free synthesis of &#945;,&#969;&#8208;hydroxyl end&#8208;functionalized polyacrylates through visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photoiniferter polymerization. By strategically blending these functionalized polyacrylates with conventional polyols, TPUs that exhibit exceptional toughness and notable self&#8208;healing capabilities, traits rarely found in existing TPUs are engineered. Furthermore, incorporating photo&#8208;crosslinkable acrylic monomers has enabled the creation of the first TPU with superior elastomeric properties and photopatterning capabilities. This approach paves the way for a new direction in polyurethane engineering, introducing a novel class of soft segments and unlocking the potential for a wide range of advanced applications.

         <title>Soft, Tough, Antifatigue Fracture Elastomer Composites with Low Thermal Resistance through Synergistic Crack Pinning and Interfacial Slippage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A soft, extreme fracture tough and antifatigue fracture polydimethylsiloxane/aluminum elastomer composite is developed by optimizing the dangling chains and spherical aluminum fillers, resulting in the combined effects of crack pinning and interfacial slippage. The elastomer composite also maintains low thermal resistance, which makes it highly promising for thermal interface applications in heat dissipation of electronic devices.








Abstract
Soft elastomer composites are promising functional materials for engineer interfaces, where the miniaturized electronic devices have triggered increasing demand for effective heat dissipation, high fracture energy, and antifatigue fracture. However, such a combination of these properties can be rarely met in the same elastomer composites simultaneously. Here a strategy is presented to fabricate a soft, extreme fracture tough (3316&#160;J m&#8722;2) and antifatigue fracture (1052.56&#160;J m&#8315;2) polydimethylsiloxane/aluminum elastomer composite. These outstanding properties are achieved by optimizing the dangling chains and spherical aluminum fillers, resulting in the combined effects of crack pinning and interfacial slippage. The dangling chains that lengthen the polymer chains between cross&#8208;linked points pin the cracks and the rigid fillers obstruct the cracks, enhancing the energy per unit area needed for fatigue failure. The dangling chains also promote polymer/filler interfacial slippage, enabling effective deflection and blunting of an advancing crack tip, thus enhancing mechanical energy dissipation. Moreover, the elastomer composite exhibits low thermal resistance (&#8776;0.12&#160;K cm2 W&#8722;1), due to the formation of a thermally conductive network. These remarkable characteristics render this elastomer composite promising for application as a thermal interface material in electronic devices.

         <title>Critical&#8208;Layered MoS2 for the Enhancement of Supercontinuum Generation in Photonic Crystal Fibre</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solid&#8208;state 2D optical layers with ultrahigh nonlinearity are subtly integrated into the commercial photonic crystal fiber to boost its supercontinuum generation efficiency. The hybrid MoS2&#8208;PCF demonstrates a 70% reduction of the threshold power for SCG with one octave spanning and manifests a critical&#8208;layered characteristic that only work under a real 2D regime.








Abstract
Supercontinuum generation (SCG) from silica&#8208;based photonic crystal fibers (PCFs) is of highly technological significance from microscopy to metrology, but has been hindered by silica's relatively low intrinsic optical nonlinearity. The prevailing approaches of filling PCF with nonlinear gases or liquids can endow fibre with enhanced optical nonlinearity and boosted SCG efficiency, yet these hybrids are easily plagued by fusion complexity, environmental incompatibility or transmission mode instability. Here this work presents&#160;a strategy of embedding solid&#8208;state 2D MoS2 atomic layers into the air&#8208;holes of PCF to efficiently enhance SCG. This work demonstrates a 4.8 times enhancement of the nonlinear coefficient and a 70% reduction of the threshold power for SCG with one octave spanning in the MoS2&#8208;PCF hybrid. Furthermore, this work finds that the SCG enhancement is highly layer&#8208;dependent, which only manifests for a real 2D regime within the thickness of five atomic layers. Theoretical calculations reveal that the critical thickness arises from the trade&#8208;off among the layer&#8208;dependent enhancement of the nonlinear coefficient, leakage of fundamental mode and redshift of zero&#8208;dispersion wavelength. This work provides significant advances toward efficient SCG, and highlights the importance of matching an appropriate atomic layer number in the design of functional 2D material optical fibers.

         <title>Concurrent Amorphization and Nanocatalyst Formation in Cu&#8208;Substituted Perovskite Oxide Surface: Effects on Oxygen Reduction Reaction at Elevated Temperatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface amorphization and the nanocatalysts ex&#8208;solution are concurrently evolved on Cu&#8208;substituted La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3&#8208;&#948; through a straightforward reduction process with prolonged time. The investigation focuses on understanding the evolution process of these phenomena and identifying the factors that contribute to improvements in performance and durability. These findings offer a practical and novel strategy for designing catalysts with redox&#8208;dynamic perovskite oxide host materials.








Abstract
The activity and durability of chemical/electrochemical catalysts are significantly influenced by their surface environments, highlighting the importance of thoroughly examining the catalyst surface. Here, Cu&#8208;substituted La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3&#8208;&#948; is selected, a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art material for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), to explore the real&#8208;time evolution of surface morphology and chemistry under a reducing atmosphere at elevated temperatures. Remarkably, in a pioneering observation, it is discovered that the perovskite surface starts to amorphize at an unusually low temperature of approximately 100 &#176;C and multicomponent metal nanocatalysts additionally form on the amorphous surface as the temperature raises to 400 &#176;C. Moreover, this investigation into the stability of the resulting amorphous layer under oxidizing conditions reveals that the amorphous structure can withstand a high&#8208;temperature oxidizing atmosphere (&#8805;650 &#176;C) only when it has undergone sufficient reduction for an extended period. Therefore, the coexistence of the active nanocatalysts and defective amorphous surface leads to a nearly 100% enhancement in the electrode resistance for the ORR over 200 h without significant degradation. These observations provide a new catalytic design strategy for using redox&#8208;dynamic perovskite oxide host materials.

Therefore, the coexistence of the active nanocatalysts and defective amorphous surface leads to a nearly 100% enhancement in the electrode resistance for the ORR over 200 h without significant degradation. These observations provide a new catalytic design strategy for using redox-dynamic perovskite oxide host materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecule Anchoring Strategy Promotes Vertically Homogeneous Crystallization and Aligned Interfaces for Efficient Pb&#8211;Sn Perovskite Solar Cells and Tandem Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecule anchoring strategy is proposed to construct Pb&#8211;Sn perovskite film with vertically aligned crystals and optimized interfaces, which produces narrow&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells with a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.3% and a record&#8208;high fill factor of 82.14%. Corresponding four&#8208;terminal (4T) all&#8208;perovskite tandem device achieves a PCE of 27.1%.








Abstract
Narrow&#8208;bandgap (NBG) Pb&#8211;Sn perovskites are ideal candidates as rear subcell in all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells. Because Pb&#8211;Sn perovskites contain multiple components, the rational regulation of vertical structure and both interfaces of the film is primarily crucial to achieve high&#8208;performing NBG perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, a molecule anchoring strategy is developed to in situ construct Cs0.1MA0.3FA0.6Pb0.5Sn0.5I3 perovskite film with vertically aligned crystals and optimized interfaces. Specifically, l&#8208;alanine methyl ester is developed as an anchoring additive to induce the vertical crystal growth, while PEA2PbI3SCN film is introduced to promote the homogeneous crystallization at the buried interface via SCN&#8722; anchoring with cations. Further ethylenediamine dihalides (EDA(I/Cl)2) post&#8208;treatment leads to the gradient energy level alignment on the film surface. Pb&#8211;Sn PSCs based on such film show efficient charge transport and extraction, producing a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.3% with an impressive fill factor of 82.14%. Notably, combining with semitransparent 1.78 eV wide&#8208;bandgap PSCs, the four&#8208;terminal all&#8208;perovskite tandem device achieves a PCE of 27.1%. This work opens up a new pathway to boost the performance of Pb&#8211;Sn PSCs and their tandem devices.

         <title>A Degradable Bioelectronic Scaffold for Localized Cell Transfection toward Enhancing Wound Healing in a 3D Space</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The repair patch achieves synchronized healing of the epidermis and dermis layers of large skin wounds in a 3D space by providing a spatial distribution scaffold for repair&#8208;related cells and increasing the secretion of healing&#8208;related factors, and this repair method not only significantly shortens the healing time but also leads to skin characteristics that are more normal after healing.








Abstract
Large skin wounds, with extensive surface area and deep vertical full&#8208;thickness involvement, can pose significant challenges in clinical settings. Traditional routes for repairing skin wounds encompass three hallmarks: 1) scab formation for hemostasis; 2) proliferation and migration of epidermal cells for wound closure; 3) proliferation, migration, and functionalization of fibroblasts and endothelial cells for dermal remodeling. However, this route face remarkable challenges to healing large wounds, usually leading to disordered structures and loss of functions in the regenerated skin, due to limited control on the transition among the three stages. In this work, an implantable bioelectronics is developed that enables the synchronization of the three stages, offering accelerated and high&#8208;quality healing of large skin wounds. The system efficiently electro&#8208;transfect local cells near the wounds, forcing cellular proliferation, while providing a 3D porous environments for synchronized migration of epidermal and dermal cells. In vivo experiments demonstrated that the system achieved synchronous progression of multiple layers within the wounds, leading to the reconstruction of a complete skin structure similar to healthy skin, which presents a new avenue for the clinical translation of large wound healing.

         <title>Fourier Surfaces Reaching Full&#8208;Color Diffraction Limits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rising demand for transformative optical devices derives the importance of optical Fourier surfaces (OFSs) minimizing optical loss of diffraction. To address the current&#160;challenges of OFSs regarding scalability and full&#8208;color diffraction, an integrative manufacturing strategy is presented for the first realization of scalable and fully transparent OFSs reaching the fundamental diffraction limits at the full&#8208;visible regimes.








Abstract
Optical Fourier surfaces (OFSs), characterized by sinusoidally profiled diffractive optical elements, can outperform traditional binary&#8208;type counterparts by minimizing optical noise through selectively driving diffraction at desired frequencies. While scanning probe lithography (SPL), gray&#8208;scale electron beam lithography (EBL), and holographic inscriptions are effective for fabricating OFSs, achieving full&#8208;color diffractions at fundamental efficiency limits is challenging. Here, an integrated manufacturing process is presented, validated theoretically and experimentally, for fully transparent OFSs reaching the fundamental limit of diffraction efficiency. Leveraging holographic inscriptions and soft nanoimprinting, this approach effectively addresses challenges in conventional OFS manufacturing, enabling scalable production of noise&#8208;free and maximally efficient OFSs with record&#8208;high throughput (1010&#8211;1012 &#181;m2&#160;h&#8722;1), surpassing SPL and EBL by 1010 times. Toward this end, a wafer&#8208;scale OFSs array is demonstrated consisting of full&#8208;color diffractive gratings, color graphics, and microlenses by the one&#8208;step nanoimprinting, which is readily compatible with rapid prototyping of OFSs even on curved panels, demanding for transformative optical devices such as augmented and virtual reality displays.

         <title>Toward Predicting the Formation of Integral&#8208;Asymmetric, Isoporous Diblock Copolymer Membranes</title>

         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembly and nonsolvent&#8208;induced phase separation (SNIPS) of block copolymers and solvents enable the fabrication of integral&#8208;asymmetric, isoporous membranes. Using large&#8208;scale particle simulations, the dependence of the membrane morphology on structural, thermodynamic (e.g., incompatibility between matrix&#8208;forming block and nonsolvent), kinetic (e.g., vitrification threshold), and process parameters (e.g., duration of EISA) is predicted.

Abstract
The self&#8208;assembly and nonsolvent&#8208;induced phase separation (SNIPS) process of block copolymers and solvents enables the fabrication of integral&#8208;asymmetric, isoporous membranes. An isoporous top layer is formed by evaporation&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (EISA) and imparts selectivity for ultrafiltration of functional macromolecules or water purification. This selective layer is&#160;supported by a macroporous bottom structure that is formed by nonsolvent&#8208;induced phase separation (NIPS) providing mechanical stability. Thereby the permeability/selectivity tradeoff is optimized. The SNIPS fabrication involves various physical phenomena&#8212;e.g.,&#160;evaporation, self&#8208;assembly, macrophase separation, vitrification &#8211; and multiple structural, thermodynamic, kinetic, and process parameters. Optimizing membrane properties and rationally designing fabrication processes is a challenge which particle simulation can significantly contribute to. Using large&#8208;scale particle simulations, it is observed that 1) a small incompatibility between matrix&#8208;forming block of the copolymer and nonsolvent, 2) a glassy arrest that occurs at a smaller polymer concentration, or 3) a higher dynamical contrast between polymer and solvent results in a finer, spongy substructure, whereas the opposite parameter choice gives rise to larger macropores with an elongated shape. These observations are confirmed by comparison to experiments on polystyrene (PS)&#8208;block&#8208;poly(4&#8208;vinylpyridine) (P4VP) diblock copolymer membranes, varying the chemical nature of the coagulant or the temperature of coagulation&#160;bath.

         <title>Flexible Single Microwire X&#8208;Ray Detector with Ultrahigh Sensitivity for Portable Radiation Detection System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible X&#8208;ray detector based on a single Ga2O3:In microwire is demonstrated, which exhibits excellent sensitivity and low detection limits. Then, based on this, a portable X&#8208;ray detection system that can detect X&#8208;rays in real&#8208;time is prepared. This work is of great significance for the development of sensitive, stable, and low false alarm rate X&#8208;ray detector.








Abstract
Sensitive, flexible, and low false alarm rate X&#8208;ray detector is crucial for medical diagnosis, industrial inspection, and scientific research. However, most semiconductors for X&#8208;ray detectors are susceptible to interference from ambient light, and their high thickness hinders their application in wearable electronics. Herein, a flexible visible&#8208;blind and ultraviolet&#8208;blind X&#8208;ray detector based on Indium&#8208;doped Gallium oxide (Ga2O3:In) single microwire is prepared. Joint experiment&#8722;theory characterizations reveal that the Ga2O3:In microwire possess a high crystal quality, large band gap, and satisfactory stability, and reliability. On this basis, an extraordinary sensitivity of 5.9&#160;&#215;&#160;105&#160;&#181;C&#160;Gyair&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2 and a low detection limit of 67.4&#160;nGyair&#160;s&#8722;1 are achieved based on the prepared Ag/Ga2O3:In/Ag device, which has outstanding operation stability and excellent high temperature stability. Taking advantage of the flexible properties of the single microwire, a portable X&#8208;ray detection system is demonstrated that shows the potential to adapt to flexible and lightweight formats. The proposed X&#8208;ray detection system enables real&#8208;time monitor for X&#8208;rays, which can be displayed on the user interface. More importantly, it has excellent resistance to natural light interference, showing a low false alarm rate. This work provides a feasible method for exploring high&#8208;performance flexible integrated micro/nano X&#8208;ray detection devices.

         <title>Achieving Super&#8208;Metallophobicity on Silicon&#8208;based Ceramics at High Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Super&#8208;metallophobivity is achieved on silicon&#8208;based ceramics at high temperature by various non&#8208;ferrous molten metals (T&gt; 523&#160;K). The extraordinary property is induced by distinctive thermodynamic and dynamic wetting behavior on micro&#8208;nanostructured surface of Si2N2O, which offers worthy insights for expansive applications such as metallurgy, 3D printing and semiconductor industry and so on.








Abstract
As a critical concept in physical chemistry, superwettability is widely concerned in both fundamental science and practical engineering in past few decades. Despite this, investigation on high temperature superwettability is still a void, which is significant both in scientific and industrial fields. Herein, a ceramic with specific high temperature non&#8208;wetting property, Si2N2O is proposed. Compared with other materials, Si2N2O is elucidated with better practical non&#8208;wetting property against various non&#8208;ferrous metals. Combining with micro&#8208;nanostructures, the metallophobicity is further improved (contact angle &gt;150&#176; and contact angle hysteresis &#8776;0&#176;). The extraordinary metal repellency is defined as &#8220;super&#8208;metallophobicity&#8221;, which is proved to be induced by distinctive thermodynamic and dynamic wetting behavior on the rough surface. The research of super&#8208;metallophobicity not only sheds light on superwettability at high temperature, but also offers worthy insights for future potential material design in a wide range of applications, such as metallurgy, 3D printing and semiconductor industry.

         <title>Blue Laser Triggered Hemostatic Peptide Hydrogel for Gastrointestinal Bleeding Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel hemostatic peptide hydrogel (HPH) consists of a self&#8208;assembly peptide (PFV) and gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) to induce ultrafast hemostasis. Moreover, HPH can be triggered by blue laser endoscopy (BLE) for nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding treatment.








Abstract
In an emergency, nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding (NVUGIB), endoscopic hemostasis is considered the gold standard intervention. However, current endoscopic hemostasis is very challenging to manage bleeding in large&#8208;diameter or deep lesions highly prone to rebleeding risk. Herein, a novel hemostatic peptide hydrogel (HPH) is reported, consisting of a self&#8208;assembly peptide sequence CFLIVIGSIIVPGDGVPGDG (PFV) and gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA), which can be triggered by blue laser endoscopy (BLE) for nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding treatment without recurring bleeding concerns. Upon contact with GelMA solution, PFV immediately fibrillates into &#946;&#8208;sheet nanofiber and solvent&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly to form HPH gel. HPH nanofiber networks induced ultrafast coagulation by enveloping blood cells and activating platelets and coagulation factors even to the blood with coagulopathy. Besides its remarkable hemostatic performance in artery and liver injury models, HPH achieves instant bleeding management in porcine NVUGIB models within 60&#160;s by preventing the rebleeding risk. This work demonstrates an extraordinary hemostatic agent for NVUGIB intervention by BLE for the first time, broadening potential application scenarios, including patients with coagulopathy and promising clinical prospects.

         <title>3D&#8208;Mapping and Manipulation of Photocurrent in an Optoelectronic Diamond Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrical currents flowing inside diamond are detected in three dimensions using the charge state of nitrogen&#8208;vacancy (NV) defects, which act as a trip&#8208;wire detector for hole current. Time&#8208;resolved imaging and direct measurement of photocurrent is combined with optical engineering of nitrogen impurities to reveal the complex dynamics of charge transport in a wide&#8208;bandgap semiconductor.








Abstract
Establishing connections between material impurities and charge transport properties in emerging electronic and quantum materials, such as wide&#8208;bandgap semiconductors, demands new diagnostic methods tailored to these unique systems. Many such materials host optically&#8208;active defect centers which offer a powerful in situ characterization system, but one that typically relies on the weak spin&#8208;electric field coupling to measure electronic phenomena. In this work, charge&#8208;state sensitive optical microscopy is combined with photoelectric detection of an array of nitrogen&#8208;vacancy (NV) centers to directly image the flow of charge carriers inside a diamond optoelectronic device, in 3D and with temporal resolution. Optical control is used to change the charge state of background impurities inside the diamond on&#8208;demand, resulting in drastically different current flow such as filamentary channels nucleating from specific, defective regions of the device. Conducting channels that control carrier flow, key steps toward optically reconfigurable, wide&#8208;bandgap optoelectronics are then engineered using light. This work might be extended to probe other wide&#8208;bandgap semiconductors (SiC, GaN) relevant to present and emerging electronic and quantum&#160;technologies.

         <title>Impregnate Carbonation: CO2&#8208;Guided In Situ Growth of Robust Superhydrophobic Structures on Concrete Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>

Inspired by concrete carbonation phenomenon, a method for in situ growing superhydrophobic concrete surface is proposed: Concrete is impregnated in Mg2+&#8208;silane solution for carbonation. Mg2+ irregularly segments the morphology of CaCO3, and silane lowers the surface energy. The concrete by impregnate carbonation is divided into a three&#8208;layer structure of superhydrophobic&#8211;hydrophobic&#8211;hydrophilic, providing stable waterproof protection for the hydrophilic matrix.








Abstract
Superhydrophobic surfaces applying on concrete can greatly improve the durability of concrete by preventing the damage from water. However, traditional design of superhydrophobic concrete surfaces by external coating encounters to problems of flaking and poor surface robustness, while that by adding hydrophobic agents or particles faces the challenges of strength damage of concrete. Drawing inspiration from the carbonation phenomenon of concrete, here a new design of in situ growing superhydrophobic structures on concrete is proposed: The concrete sample is impregnated into Mg2+&#8208;containing silane&#8211;water system with continuous CO2 injection. The contact angle of the concrete surface achieves 171.9&#176; without obvious strength decrease after 120 min, which are mainly attributed to the formation of CaxMg1&#8722;xCO3 crystals with micro&#8208;nano&#8208;structures and the reduction of carbonates surface energy by silane. This superhydrophobic concrete structure can be divided into a superhydrophobic&#8211;hydrophobic&#8211;hydrophilic three layers structure, providing the stable water&#8208;proof protection under mechanical fatigue, capillary water absorption, UV aging, sulfate attack, and impurity water impact tests due to the in situ growing robust superhydrophobic structures. Furthermore, it captures 29.80&#160;g&#160;m&#8722;2 CO2 during the reaction process, providing new insights for the design and preparation of eco&#8208;friendly superhydrophobic concrete.

         <title>Direct Observations of Spontaneous In&#8208;Plane Electronic Polarization in 2D Te Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;element tellurium (Te) films are experimentally demonstrated to host an in&#8208;plane spontaneous electronic polarization, evident with reversed band&#8208;bending trends at opposite polarization edges in spatially resolved spectra and conductance mappings. The imaged moir&#233; superlattice can be effectively tuned at the polarization edges. The polarization can survive irrespective of the film thickness and supporting substrates, validating its robustness and universality.








Abstract
Single&#8208;element polarization in low dimensions is fascinating for constructing next&#8208;generation nanoelectronics with multiple functionalities, yet remains difficult to access with satisfactory performance. Here, spectroscopic evidences are presented for the spontaneous electronic polarization in tellurium (Te) films thinned down to bilayer, characterized by low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy. The unique chiral structure and centrosymmetry&#8208;breaking character in 2D&#160;Te gives rise to sizable in&#8208;plane polarization with accumulated charges, which is demonstrated by the reversed band&#8208;bending trends at opposite polarization edges in spatially resolved spectra and conductance mappings. The polarity of charges exhibits intriguing influence on imaging the moir&#233; superlattice at the Te&#8208;graphene interface. Moreover, the plain spontaneous polarization robustly exists for various film thicknesses, and can universally preserve against different epitaxial substrates. The experimental validations of considerable electronic polarization in Te multilayers thus provide a realistic platform for promisingly facilitating reliable applications in microelectronic devices.

         <title>Realization of a 2D Lieb Lattice in a Metal&#8211;Inorganic Framework with Partial Flat Bands and Topological Edge States</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flat bands, Dirac cones, and van Hove singularities in the Lieb lattice, unveiling a multitude of fascinating physical phenomena, are still highly sought. Here, theoretical analysis with experimental validation is combined to explore an innovative approach circumventing structural instability to realize a 2D Lieb lattice, showcasing its partial flat bands and topological edge states.









Abstract
Flat bands and Dirac cones in materials are the source of the exotic electronic and topological properties. The Lieb lattice is expected to host these electronic structures, arising from quantum destructive interference. Nevertheless, the experimental realization of a 2D Lieb lattice remained challenging to date due to its intrinsic structural instability. After computationally designing a Platinum&#8208;Phosphorus (Pt&#8208;P) Lieb lattice, it has successfully overcome its structural instability and synthesized on a gold substrate via molecular beam epitaxy. Low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy verify the Lieb lattice's morphology and electronic flat bands. Furthermore, topological Dirac edge states stemming from pronounced spin&#8208;orbit coupling induced by heavy Pt atoms are predicted. These findings convincingly open perspectives for creating metal&#8211;inorganic framework&#8208;based atomic lattices, offering prospects for strongly correlated phases interplayed with topology.

         <title>Regulation of Molecular Microheterogeneity in Electrolytes Enables Ampere&#8208;Hour&#8208;Level Aqueous LiMn2O4||Li4Ti5O12 Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optimally regulating molecular microheterogeneity in aqueous&#8208;based electrolytes provides an effective means to reorganize the spatial distribution of H2O molecules, isolating H2O&#8208;rich microclusters. This reorganization significantly impedes H2O activity, enhancing electrochemical stability without compromising rapid transport of Li cations. With this electrolyte design, ampere&#8208;hour&#8208;level aqueous LiMn2O4||Li4Ti5O12 pouch cell exhibits high energy density and excellent cycling stability.








Abstract
Aqueous batteries are attractive due to their high safety and fast reaction kinetics, but the narrow electrochemical stability window of H2O limits their applications. It is a big challenge to broaden the electrochemical operation window of aqueous electrolytes while retaining fast reaction kinetics. Here, a new organic aqueous mixture electrolyte of manipulatable (3D)&#160;molecular microheterogeneity with H2O&#8208;rich and H2O&#8208;poor domains is demonstrated. H2O&#8208;poor domains molecularly surround the reformed microclusters of H2O molecules through interfacial H&#8208;bonds, which thus not only inhibit the long&#8208;range transfer of H2O but also allow fast and consecutive Li+ transport. This new design enables low&#8208;voltage anodes reversibly cycling with aqueous&#8208;based electrolytes and high ionic conductivity of 4.5 mS cm&#8722;1. LiMn2O4||Li4Ti5O12 full cells demonstrate excellent cycling stability over 1000 cycles under various C rates and a low temperature of &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C. 1 Ah pouch cell delivers a high energy density of 79.3&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and high Coulombic efficiency of 99.4% at 1 C over 200 cycles. This work provides new insights into the design of electrolytes based on the molecular microheterogeneity for rechargeable batteries.

         <title>Precise Lubrication and Protection of Cartilage Damage by Targeting Hydrogel Microsphere</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An antibody&#8208;mediated targeting hydrogel microsphere is developed to specifically and precisely lubricate and protect the local injury site of early&#8208;stage osteoarthritis (OA). The in vivo experiments demonstrate that even with a single small dose injection, this precise lubrication strategy can effectively slow down the progression of early OA and alleviate the associated pain.








Abstract
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative bone and joint disease characterized by decreased cartilage lubrication, leading to continuous wear and ultimately irreversible damage. This situation is particularly challenging for early&#8208;stage OA, as current bio&#8208;lubricants lack precise targeting for small inflammatory lesions. In this work, an antibody&#8208;mediated targeting hydrogel microspheres (HMS) is developed to precisely lubricate the local injury site of cartilage and prevent the progression of early OA. Anti&#8208;Collagen type I (Anti&#8208;Col1) is an antibody that targets cartilage injury sites in early OA stages. It is anchored on a HMS matrix made of Gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) and poly (sulfobetaine methacrylate) (PSBMA) to create targeted HMS (T&#8208;G/S HMS). The T&#8208;G/S HMS's high hydrophilicity, along with the dynamic interaction between its surficial Anti&#8208;Col1 and the Col1 on cartilage injury site, ensures its precise and effective lubrication of early OA lesions. Consequently, injecting T&#8208;G/S HMS into rats with early OA significantly slows disease progression and reduces symptoms. In conclusion, the developed injectable targeted lubricating HMS and the precisely targeted lubrication strategy represent a promising, convenient technique for treating OA, particularly for slowing the early&#8208;stage OA progression.

This situation is particularly challenging for early-stage OA, as current bio-lubricants lack precise targeting for small inflammatory lesions. In this work, an antibody-mediated targeting hydrogel microspheres (HMS) is developed to precisely lubricate the local injury site of cartilage and prevent the progression of early OA. Anti-Collagen type I (Anti-Col1) is an antibody that targets cartilage injury sites in early OA stages. It is anchored on a HMS matrix made of Gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) and poly (sulfobetaine methacrylate) (PSBMA) to create targeted HMS (T-G/S HMS). The T-G/S HMS's high hydrophilicity, along with the dynamic interaction between its surficial Anti-Col1 and the Col1 on cartilage injury site, ensures its precise and effective lubrication of early OA lesions. Consequently, injecting T-G/S HMS into rats with early OA significantly slows disease progression and reduces symptoms. In conclusion, the developed injectable targeted lubricating HMS and the precisely targeted lubrication strategy represent a promising, convenient technique for treating OA, particularly for slowing the early-stage OA progression.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tailoring Polaron Dimensions in Lead&#8208;Tin Hybrid Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The two bottles represent the perovskite lattices of MAPbI3 and MASn0.25Pb0.75I3, respectively. Upon photoexcitation, polarons are generated within the perovskites. The various balls illustrate polarons with different sizes. In MAPbI3, the polaron size is larger, resulting in a significantly limited polaron density. Conversely, in MASn0.25Pb0.75I3, the smaller polaron size facilitates a much higher polaron density.








Abstract
Charge carriers in the soft and polar perovskite lattice form so&#8208;called polaron quasiparticles, charge carriers dressed with a lattice deformation. The spatial extent of a polaron is governed by the material's electron&#8208;phonon interaction strength, which determines charge carrier effective mass, mobility, and the so&#8208;called Mott polaron density, that is, the maximum stable density of charge carriers that a perovskite can support. Despite its significance, controlling polaron dimensions has been challenging. Here, experimental substantial tuning of polaron dimensions is reported by lattice engineering, through Pb/Sn substitution in CH3NH3SnxPb1&#8722;xI3. The polaron dimension is deduced from the Mott polaron density, which can be composition&#8208;tuned over an order of magnitude, while charge carrier mobility occurs through band transport, and remains substantial across all compositions, ranging from 10&#160;s to 100 s&#160;cm2&#160;V s&#8722;1 at room temperature. The effective modulation of polaron size can be understood by considering the bond asymmetry after carrier injection as well as the random spatial distribution of Pb/Sn ions. This study underscores the potential for tailoring polaron dimensions, which is crucial for optimizing applications prioritizing either high charge carrier density or high mobility.

         <title>Inducing One&#8208;Step Dehydrogenation of Magnesium Borohydride via Confinement in Robust Dodecahedral Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Porous Carbon Scaffold</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dodecahedral activated N&#8208;doped porous carbon scaffold is synthesized and used for the nanoconfinement of Mg(BH4)2. Precise activation control enables a transformation from microporous carbon materials to mesoporous ones with extremely high specific surface area and pore volume, and hence the efficient nanoconfinement of Mg(BH4)2, realization of one&#8208;step dehydrogenation and superior reversibility.








Abstract
A dodecahedral activated N&#8208;doped porous carbon scaffold is synthesized and used for the nanoconfinement of Mg(BH4)2. The optimized mesoporous scaffold possesses an accumulated pore width of 2.65&#160;nm, high specific surface area (3955.9 m2&#160;g&#8722;1), and large pore volume (2.15 cm3&#160;g&#8722;1), providing ample space for the confinement of Mg(BH4)2 particles and numerous surface active sites for interactions with the same. The confined Mg(BH4)2 system features a dehydrogenation onset temperature of 81.5&#160;&#176;C, an extremely high capacity of 10.2 wt% H2, and an almost single&#8208;step dehydrogenation profile. Moreover, the system exhibits superior capacity retention of 82.7% after 20 cycles at a moderate temperature of 250&#160;&#176;C. Precise activation control enables a transformation from microporous carbon materials to mesoporous ones, and hence the efficient nanoconfinement of Mg(BH4)2 and realization of one&#8208;step dehydrogenation. The evolution of borohydride intermediates is systematically revealed throughout the cycling process. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate defective N heteroatoms within the scaffold are vital in reducing the strength of B&#9472;H bonds, and the N&#8208;doped carbon can facilitate decomposition of the irreversible MgB12H12 intermediate. This study opens up new avenues for designing robust carbon scaffolds doped with heteroatoms and analyzing intermediate evolution in nanoconfined Mg&#8208;based borohydride systems.

Assembling polar entities in structures of various shapes promises the design of the electronic properties of materials outside the beaten paths. The current perspective article suggests strategies for the application of such polar layers at hybrid interfaces, in van der Waals heterostructures, in polar metal&#8208;organic frameworks, and in covalent organic frameworks comprising pores decorated with polar groups.








Abstract
Collective electrostatic effects arise from the superposition of electrostatic potentials of periodically arranged (di)polar entities and are known to crucially impact the electronic structures of hybrid interfaces. Here, it is discussed, how they can be used outside the beaten paths of materials design for realizing systems with advanced and sometimes unprecedented properties. The versatility of the approach is demonstrated by applying electrostatic design not only to metal&#8208;organic interfaces and adsorbed (complex) monolayers, but also to inter&#8208;layer interfaces in van der Waals heterostructures, to polar metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), and to the cylindrical pores of covalent organic frameworks (COFs). The presented design ideas are straightforward to simulate and especially for metal&#8208;organic interfaces also their experimental implementation has been amply demonstrated. For van der Waals heterostructures, the needed building blocks are available, while the required assembly approaches are just being developed. Conversely, for MOFs the necessary growth techniques exist, but more work on advanced linker molecules is required. Finally, COF structures exist that contain pores decorated with polar groups, but the electrostatic impact of these groups has been largely ignored so far. All this suggest that the dawn of the age of electrostatic design is currently experienced with potential breakthroughs lying ahead.

         <title>Intelligent Supramolecular Modification for Implants: Endogenous Regulation of Bone Defect Repair in Osteoporosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intelligent supramolecular modified implant surface suitable for bone defect repair under iron&#8208;overloaded osteoporosis. This intelligent surface modification tailors bone repair to individual conditions, automatically realize multiple endogenous regulation once implanted, and truly realize spontaneous activation of a series of responses conducive to bone repair in vivo. It providing new ideas for the refinement and specialized modification of the implant surface.








Abstract
Addressing osteoporosis&#8208;related bone defects, a supramolecular strategy is innovated for modifying carbon fiber reinforced polyether ether ketone (CF/PEEK) composites. By covalently attaching intelligent macromolecules via in situ RAFT polymerization, leveraging the unique pathological microenvironment in patients with iron&#8208;overloaded osteoporosis, intelligent supramolecular modified implant surface possesses multiple endogenous modulation capabilities. After implantation, surface brush&#8208;like macromolecules initially resist macrophage adhesion, thereby reducing the level of immune inflammation. Over time, the molecular chains undergo conformational changes due to Fe (III) mediated supramolecular self&#8208;assembly, transforming into mechanistic signals. These signals are then specifically transmitted to pre&#8208;osteoblast cell through the binding capacity of the KRSR short peptide at the molecular terminus, induced their osteogenic differentiation via the YAP/&#946;&#8208;catenin signaling axis. Furthermore, osteoblasts secrete alkaline phosphatase (ALP), which significantly hydrolyzes phosphate ester bonds in surface macromolecular side groups, resulting in the release of alendronate (ALN). This process further improves the local osteoporotic microenvironment. This intelligent surface modification tailors bone repair to individual conditions, automatically realize multiple endogenous regulation once implanted, and truly realize spontaneous activation of a series of responses conducive to bone repair in vivo. It is evidenced by improved bone regeneration in iron&#8208;overloaded osteoporotic rabbits and supported by in vitro validations.

         <title>Flexible Terahertz Metasurface Absorbers Empowered by Bound States in the Continuum</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study connects absorbers with bound states in the continuum by systematically exploring radiation properties from a perspective of lattice symmetry. A flexible terahertz absorber is demonstrated with stable and high absorption coefficient covering a large field of view, with tunable bandwidth, and multiband absorption. It would provide valuable insights for terahertz applications in communications, detection, sensing, and imaging.








Abstract
Terahertz absorbers are crucial to the cutting&#8208;edge techniques in the next&#8208;generation wireless communications, imaging, sensing, and radar stealth, as they fundamentally determine the performance of detectors and cloaking capabilities. It has long been a pressing task to find absorbers with customizable performance that can adapt to various environments with low cost and great flexibility. Here, perfect absorption empowered by bound states in the continuum (BICs)&#160;is demonstrated,&#160;allowing for the tailoring of absorption coefficient, bandwidth, and field of view. The one&#8208;port absorbers are interpreted using temporal coupled&#8208;mode theory highlighting the dominant role of BICs in the far&#8208;field radiation properties. Through a thorough investigation of BICs from the perspective of lattice symmetry, the radiation features of three BIC modes are unraveled using both multipolar and topological analysis. The versatile radiation capabilities of BICs provide ample freedom to meet specific requirements of absorbers, including tunable bandwidth, stable performance in a large field of view, and multiband absorption using a thin and flexible film without extreme geometric demands. These findings offer a systematic approach to developing optoelectronic devices and demonstrate the significant potential of BICs for optical and photonic applications, which will stimulate further studies on terahertz photonics and metasurfaces.

         <title>Efficient Generation of Out&#8208;of&#8208;Plane Polarized Spin Current in Polycrystalline Heavy Metal Devices with Broken Electric Symmetries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Z&#8208;spin current has the potential to enable energy&#8208;efficient switching of perpendicular magnetization in the absence of a magnetic field. The work by Lijun Zhu and co&#8208;workers reports the first universal, energy&#8208;efficient, integration&#8208;friendly approach to generate z&#8208;spin current by electric asymmetry design for dense and low&#8208;power spin&#8211;torque memory and computing technologies.








Abstract
Spin currents of perpendicularly polarized spins (z spins) have received blooming interest for the potential in energy&#8208;efficient spin&#8211;orbit torque switching of perpendicular magnetization in the absence of a magnetic field. However, generation of z spins is limited mainly to magnetically or crystallographically low&#8208;symmetry single crystals that are hardly compatible with the integration to semiconductor circuits. This work reports efficient generation of z spins in sputter&#8208;deposited polycrystalline heavy metal devices via a new mechanism of broken electric symmetries in both the transverse and perpendicular directions. Both the damping&#8208;like and field&#8208;like spin&#8211;orbit torques of z spins can be tuned significantly by varying the degree of the electric asymmetries via the length, width, and thickness of devices as well as by varying the type of the heavy metals. The presence of z spins also enables deterministic, nearly&#8208;full, external&#8208;magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;free switching of a uniform perpendicularly magnetized FeCoB layer, the core structure of magnetic tunnel junctions, with high coercivity at a low current density. These results establish the first universal, energy&#8208;efficient, integration&#8208;friendly approach to generate z&#8208;spin current by electric asymmetry design for dense and low&#8208;power spin&#8208;torque memory and computing technologies and will stimulate investigation of z&#8208;spin currents in various polycrystalline materials.

         <title>Edible Ultralong Organic Phosphorescent Excipient for Afterglow Visualizing the Quality of Tablets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An edible excipient with intrinsically multistimuli responsive ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) property is developed to achieve nondestructive detection of hardness with superb contrast (signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio up to 120) and moisture with improved sensitivity (5.0 times to conventional fluorescence) of drug tablets. The naked&#8208;eye visible UOP shows promise in both promoting continuous smart manufacturing and safe medicine for patients.








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) materials that in response to external factors such as light, heat, and atmosphere have raised a tremendous research interest in fields of optoelectronics, anticounterfeiting labeling, biosensing, and bioimaging. However, for practical applications in life and health fields, some fundamental requirements such as biocompatibility and biodegradability are still challenging for conventional inorganic and aromatic&#8208;based stimuli&#8208;responsive UOP systems. Herein, an edible excipient, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (SCC), of which UOP properties exhibit intrinsically multistimuli responses to excited wavelength, pressure, and moisture, is reported. Impressively, as a UOP probe, SCC enables nondestructive detection of hardness with superb contrast (signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio up to 120), while exhibiting a response sensitivity to moisture that is more than 5.0 times higher than that observed in conventional fluorescence. Additionally, its applicability for hardness monitoring and high&#8208;moisture warning for tablets containing a moisture&#8208;sensitive drug, with the quality of the drug being determinable through the naked&#8208;eye visible UOP, is demonstrated. This work not only elucidates the reason for stimulative corresponding properties in SCC but also makes a major step forward in extending the potential applications of stimuli&#8208;responsive UOP materials in manufacturing high&#8208;quality and safe medicine.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Intrinsically Stretchable Organic Photovoltaics Enabled by Robust Silver Nanowires/S&#8208;PH1000 Hybrid Transparent Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, superior stretchable transparent electrodes (STEs) that possess both high conductivity and stretchability are developed. The STEs enable intrinsically stretchable organic photovoltaics (is&#8208;OPVs) a remarkable PCE of 16.32% and commendable stretchability. Additionally, OPVs equipped with these STEs exhibit superior thermal stability compared to those using indium tin oxide electrode.








Abstract
Intrinsically stretchable organic photovoltaics (is&#8208;OPVs) hold significant promise for integration into self&#8208;powered wearable electronics. However, their potential is hindered by the lack of sufficient consistency between optoelectronic and mechanical properties. This is primarily due to the limited availability of stretchable transparent electrodes (STEs) that possess both high conductivity and stretchability. Here, a hybrid STE with exceptional conductivity, stretchability, and thermal stability is presented. Specifically, STEs are composed of the modified PH1000 (referred to as S&#8208;PH1000) and silver nanowires (AgNWs). The S&#8208;PH1000 endows the STE with good stretchability and smoothens the surface, while the AgNWs enhance the charge transport. The resulting hybrid STEs enable is&#8208;OPVs to a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.32%, positioning them among the top&#8208;performing is&#8208;OPVs. With 10% elastomer, the devices retain 82% of the initial PCE after 500 cycles at 20% strain. Additionally, OPVs equipped with these STEs exhibit superior thermal stability compared to those using indium tin oxide electrodes, maintaining 75% of the initial PCE after annealing at 85&#160;&#176;C for 390 h. The findings underscore the suitability of the designed hybrid electrodes for efficient and stable is&#8208;OPVs, offering a promising avenue for the future application of OPVs.

PVDF@PEI core&#8211;shell nanofibers are developed via symmetry&#8208;breaking design for efficient radiative cooling. The membranes show high thermal stability, hydrophobicity, UV protection, fluorescence enhancement, and breathability, enabling 8&#160;&#176;C daytime cooling. This innovation advances wearables and multifunctional materials research.








Abstract
Radiative cooling technology, which is renowned for its ability to dissipate heat without energy consumption, has garnered immense interest. However, achieving high performance, multifunctionality, and smart integration while addressing challenges such as film thickness and enhancing anisotropic light reflection remains challenging. In this study, a core&#8211;shell composite nanofiber, PVDF@PEI, is introduced and designed primarily from a symmetry&#8208;breaking perspective to develop highly efficient radiative cooling materials. Using a combination of solvent&#8208;induced phase separation (EIPS) inverse spinning and (aggregation) self&#8208;assembly methods (EISA or EIAA) and coaxial electrostatic spinning (ES), superconformal surface anisotropic porous nanofiber membranes are fabricated. These membranes exhibit exceptional thermal stability (up to 210&#160;&#176;C), high hydrophobicity (contact angle of 126&#176;), robust UV protection (exceeding 99%), a fluorescence multiplication effect (with a 0.6% increase in fluorescence quantum efficiency), and good breathability. These properties enable the material to excel in a wide range of application scenarios. Moreover, this material achieved a remarkable daytime cooling temperature of 8&#160;&#176;C. The development of this fiber membrane offers significant advancements in the field of wearables and the multifunctionality of materials, paving new paths for future research and innovation.

         <title>Crystalline Texture Reengineering of Zinc Powder&#8208;Based Fibrous Anode for Remarkable Mechano&#8208;Electrochemical Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>

Wet&#8208;spinning technique is utilized to fabricate Zn@CNTs fiber for anode of fibrous Zn&#8208;ion battery with remarkable electrochemical performance after textural reengineering via thermal treatment. Fibrous Zn&#8208;ion battery equipped with derived fiber anode showcase exceptional chemical stability and fatigue resistance after long&#8208;term fibrous battery deformation.








Abstract
The challenge of inadequate mechano&#8208;electrochemical stability in rechargeable fibrous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (FZIBs) has emerged as a critical challenge for their broad applications. Traditional rigid Zn wires struggle to maintain a stable electrochemical interface when subjected to external mechanical stress. To address this issue, a wet&#8208;spinning technique has been developed to fabricate Zn powder based fibrous anode, while carbon nanotubes (CNTs) introduced to enhance the spinnability of Zn powder dispersion. The followed annealing treatment has been conducted to reengineer the Zn crystalline texture with CNTs assisted surface tension regulation to redirect (002) crystallographic textural formation. The thus&#8208;derived annealed Zn@CNTs fiber demonstrates great mechano&#8208;electrochemical stability after a long&#8208;term bending and electrochemical process. The fabricated FZIB demonstrates a remarkable durability, surpassing 800&#160;h at 1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and 1&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2, with a marginal voltage hysteresis increase of 21.7&#160;mV even after 100 twisting cycles under 180 degree twisting angle. The assembled FZIB full cell displays an 88.6% capacity retention even after a long cycle of a series of bending, knotting, and straightening deformation. It has been also woven into a 200&#160;cm2 size textile to demonstrate its capability to integrate into smart textiles.

         <title>Systemic Multifunctional Nanovaccines for Potent Personalized Immunotherapy of Acute Myeloid Leukemia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hematological malignancies (HM) like acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are often intractable. This study develops systemic nanovaccines consisting of tumor cell lysate and dual adjuvants muramyl dipeptide and CpG (MCA&#8208;NV) to induce strong, durable, and broad anti&#8208;AML immunity. Intravenous infusion of nanovaccines substantially outperforms subcutaneous administration and cures 78% of AML&#8208;bearing mice. MCA&#8208;NV provides a personalized immunotherapeutic strategy against HM.









Abstract
Hematological malignancies (HM) like acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are often intractable. Cancer vaccines possibly inducing robust and broad anti&#8208;tumor immune responses may be a promising treatment option for HM. Few effective vaccines against blood cancers are, however, developed to date partly owing to insufficient stimulation of dendritic cells (DCs) in the body and lacking appropriate tumor antigens (Ags). Here it is found that systemic multifunctional nanovaccines consisting of nucleotide&#8208;binding oligomerization domain&#8208;containing protein 2 (NOD2) and Toll&#8208;like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonists &#8211; muramyl dipeptide (MDP) and CpG, and tumor cell lysate (TCL) as Ags (MCA&#8208;NV) induce potent and broad immunity against AML. MCA&#8208;NV show complementary stimulation of DCs and prime homing to lymphoid organs following systemic administration. Of note, in orthotopic AML mouse models, intravenous infusion of different vaccine formulations elicits substantially higher anti&#8208;AML efficacies than subcutaneous administration. Systemic MCA&#8208;NV cure 78% of AML mice and elicit long&#8208;term immune memory with 100% protection from rechallenging AML cells. Systemic MCA&#8208;NV can also serve as prophylactic vaccines against the same AML. These systemic nanovaccines utilizing patient TCL as Ags and dual adjuvants to elicit strong, durable, and broad immune responses can provide a personalized immunotherapeutic strategy against AML and other HM.

         <title>Above&#8208;Room&#8208;Temperature Ferroelectricity and Giant Second Harmonic Generation in 1D vdW NbOI3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 1D vdW ferroelectric NbOI3 nanowires possess a high Curie temperature TC&#160;&gt; &#160;450&#160;K. Impressively, NbOI3 exhibits a giant second harmonic generation (SHG) effect with a susceptibility up to 1572&#160;pm&#160;V&#8722;1 at 810&#160;nm, and a further enhanced SHG susceptibility of 5582&#160;pm&#160;V&#8722;1 under the pressure of 2.06&#160;GPa.








Abstract
The realization of spontaneous ferroelectricity down to the one&#8208;dimensional (1D) limit is both fundamentally intriguing and practically appealing for high&#8208;density ferroelectric and nonlinear photonics. However, the 1D vdW ferroelectric materials are not discovered experimentally yet. Here, the first 1D vdW ferroelectric compound NbOI3 with a high Curie temperature TC&#160;&gt;&#160;450&#160;K and giant second harmonic generation (SHG) is reported. The 1D crystalline chain structure of the NbOI3 is revealed by cryo&#8208;electron microscopy, whereas the 1D ferroelectric order originated from the Nb displacement along the Nb&#8208;O chain (b&#8208;axis) is confirmed via obvious electrical and ferroelectric hysteresis loops. Impressively, NbOI3 exhibits a giant SHG susceptibility up to 1572&#160;pm&#160;V&#8722;1 at a fundamental wavelength of 810&#160;nm, and a further enhanced SHG susceptibility of 5582&#160;pm&#160;V&#8722;1 under the applied hydrostatic pressure of 2.06&#160;GPa. Combing in situ pressure&#8208;dependent X&#8208;ray diffraction, Raman spectra measurements, and first&#8208;principles calculations, it is demonstrated that the O atoms shift along the Nb&#9472;O atomic chain under compression, which can lead to the increased Baur distortion of [NbO2I4] octahedra, and hence induces the enhancement of SHG. This work provides a 1D vdW ferroelectric system for developing novel ferroelectronic and photonic devices.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomimetic polymer&#8208;particle hydrogels are developed as sprayable water&#8208;enhancing hydrogels that transition into thermally insulative silica aerogels upon heat activation. These hydrogels exhibit superior viscoelastic properties, strong substrate adherence, and dramatically enhanced fire protection compared to commercial gels. This innovation significantly advances water&#8208;enhancing hydrogels, offering robust protection for critical infrastructure and homes during wildfires, thereby markedly improving wildfire prevention and mitigation strategies.








Abstract
A promising strategy to address the pressing challenges with wildfire, particularly in the wildland&#8208;urban interface (WUI), involves developing new approaches for preventing and controlling wildfire within wildlands. Among sprayable fire&#8208;retardant materials, water&#8208;enhancing gels have emerged as exceptionally effective for protecting civil infrastructure. They possess favorable wetting and viscoelastic properties that reduce the likelihood of ignition, maintaining strong adherence to a wide array of surfaces after application. Although current water&#8208;enhancing hydrogels effectively maintain surface wetness by creating a barricade, they rapidly desiccate and lose efficacy under high heat and wind typical of wildfire conditions. To address this limitation, unique biomimetic hydrogel materials from sustainable cellulosic polymers crosslinked by colloidal silica particles are developed that exhibit ideal viscoelastic properties and facile manufacturing. Under heat activation, the hydrogel transitions into a highly porous and thermally insulative silica aerogel coating in situ, providing a robust protective layer against ignition of substrates, even when the hydrogel fire suppressant becomes completely desiccated. By confirming the mechanical properties, substrate adherence, and enhanced substrate protection against fire, these heat&#8208;activatable biomimetic hydrogels emerge as promising candidates for next&#8208;generation water&#8208;enhancing fire suppressants. These advancements have the potential to dramatically improve the ability to protect homes and critical infrastructure during wildfire.

         <title>Synthesis of Heteromorphic Bi2WO6 Films With an Interpenetrate 1D/2D Network Structure for Efficient and Stable Photocatalytic Degradation of VOCs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Bi2WO6 (BWO) film with a network structure of 2D (NSs) penetrated with 1D nanofibers (NFs) is reported. BWO NSs can grow radially in an orderly spaced arrangement along BWO NFs during sintering, thereby forming 1D/2D BWO junctions like eucalyptus leaves, which can rapidly degrade acetaldehyde under visible light and shows superior stability for eight cycles without any decays.








Abstract
2D layered Bi2WO6 (BWO) is a widely used attractive photocatalyst for degrading VOCs, but the low visible&#8208;light utilization and the easy stacking 2D nanosheets&#160;(NSs) limit photocatalysis efficiency and stability. Here, inspired by Eucalyptus, a synergistic strategy of multiscale domain&#8208;confinement and electrostatic force action, based on electrospinning is proposed, for fabricating a heteromorphic BWO photocatalyst. It is found that BWO NSs can grow radially in an orderly spaced arrangement along BWO nanofibers (NFs) during sintering, thereby forming 1D/2D BWO junctions like eucalyptus leaves. This interpenetrating 1D/2D network structure not only solves the easy stacking problem of BWO NSs but also selectively exposes the {010} crystal planes that exhibit efficient hole oxidation. In addition, this peculiar structure enriches electrons at the 1D/2D interface to avoid carrier recombination, thus improving the photocatalytic activity. The photocatalyst material with a reduced bandgap width from 2.56 to 2.49&#160;eV can rapidly degrade 100% of acetaldehyde under visible light without using sacrificial agents and photosensitizers and shows superior stability for eight cycles without any decay. This study provides a feasible method to synthesize an efficient and stable BWO photocatalyst.

         <title>Porous Polymeric Electrodes for Electrochemical Carbon Dioxide Capture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox&#8208;active porous polymeric electrodes (PPEs) are developed with promoted advective gas transport and enhanced gas&#8208;electrolyte contact adsorption area in a flow&#8208;through mode for high&#8208;efficiency carbon dioxide capture. This strategy offers new possibilities for manufacturing scalable and cost&#8208;effective electrodes and is anticipated to be transferable to general electrochemically mediated separation technologies.








Abstract
Carbon capture is a promising technology to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions to achieve net carbon neutrality. Electro&#8208;swing reactive adsorption has emerged as an attractive approach for sustainable decarbonization. However, current electrodes with limited gas transport present a major barrier that hinders their practical implementation. Herein, porous polymeric electrodes are developed to effectively enhance CO2 transport without the need for additional gas diffusion conduits. Such all&#8208;in&#8208;one porous electrodes also enable more accessible redox active sites (e.g., quinones) for CO2 sorption, leading to an increased materials utilization efficiency of &#8776;90%. A continuous flow&#8208;through carbon capture and release operation with high Faradaic efficiency and excellent stability under practical working conditions is further demonstrated. Together with low cost and robust mechanical properties, the as&#8208;developed porous polymeric electrodes highlight the potential to advance the future implementation of electrochemical separation technologies.

         <title>Stiffness and Interface Engineered Soft Electronics with Large&#8208;Scale Robust Deformability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By simultaneously regulating stiffness and enhancing interfacial binding force, this work provides an efficient path to realize robust large&#8208;scale deformable electronic skins. Stiff and elastic areas of the designed substrate have nearly four orders of magnitudes modulus contrast and cross&#8208;linked interfaces. Electronic devices and liquid metal interconnects are conformally attached at the stiff and elastic areas, respectively, through hydrogen bonds.








Abstract
Skin&#8208;like stretchable electronics emerge as promising human&#8211;machine interfaces but are challenged by the paradox between superior electronic property and reliable mechanical deformability. Here, a general strategy is reported for establishing robust large&#8208;scale deformable electronics by effectively isolating strains and strengthening interfaces. A copolymer substrate is designed to consist of mosaic stiff and elastic areas with nearly four orders of magnitudes modulus contrast and cross&#8208;linked interfaces. Electronic functional devices and stretchable liquid metal (LM) interconnects are conformally attached at the stiff and elastic areas, respectively, through hydrogen bonds. As a result, functional devices are completely isolated from strains, and resistances of LM conductors change by less than one time when the substrate is deformed by up to 550%. By this strategy, solar cells, wireless charging antenna, supercapacitors, and light&#8208;emitting diodes are integrated into a self&#8208;powered electronic skin that can laminate on the human body and exhibit stable performances during repeated multimode deformations, demonstrating an efficient path for realizing highly deformable energy autonomous soft electronics.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II&#8208;Responsive Hybrid System Achieves Cascade&#8208;Augmented Antitumor Immunity via Genetic Engineering of Both Bacteria and Tumor Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) light&#8208;responsive genetic engineering of both bacteria and tumor cells is achieved by a hybrid therapeutic platform consisting of genetically engineered bacteria and photothermal nanoparticles for tumor&#8208;targeted and augmented immunotherapy of melanoma. A synergistic antitumor effect is achieved during the process of antioncogene transfection and NIR&#8208;II light&#8208;activated expression of the therapeutic immunomodulator.








Abstract
The combination of nanoparticles and tumor&#8208;targeting bacteria for cancer immunotherapy can overcome the shortcomings of poor nanoparticle accumulation, limited penetration, and restricted distribution. However, it remains a great challenge for the hybrid system to improve therapeutic efficacy through the simultaneous and controllable regulation of immune cells and tumor cells. Herein, a hybrid therapeutic platform is rationally designed to achieve immune cascade&#8208;augmented cancer immunotherapy. To construct the hybrids, photothermal nanoparticles responsive to light in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) region are conjugated onto the surface of engineered bacteria through pH&#8208;responsive Schiff base bonds. Taking advantage of the hypoxia targeting and deep penetration characteristics of the bacteria, the hybrids can accumulate at tumor sites. Then nanoparticles detach from the bacteria to realize genetic engineering of tumor cells, which induces tumor cell apoptosis and down&#8208;regulate the expression of programmed cell death ligand 1 to alleviate immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. The mild photothermal heating can not only induce tumor&#8208;associated antigen release, but also trigger sustainable expression of cytokine interleukin&#8208;2. Notably, a synergistic antitumor effect is achieved between the process of p53 transfection and NIR&#8208;II light&#8208;activated genetic engineering of bacteria. This work proposes a facile strategy for the construction of hybrid system to achieve cascade&#8208;augmented cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Photothermal Catalytic Reduction and Bone Tissue Engineering Towards a Three&#8208;in&#8208;One Therapy Strategy for Osteosarcoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A triple&#8208;function 3D&#8208;printed bioscaffold equipped with CMB nanowheel crystals (CMB@BG) is designed and engineered for the comprehensive treatment of osteosarcoma. Due to their photothermally enhanced ROS&#8208;scavenging capacity, CMB@BG scaffolds exhibit exceptional NIR&#8208;II photothermal&#8208;conversion efficiency, osteogenic induction activity, and anti&#8208;inflammatory capabilities. Therefore, they are regarded as an ideal therapeutic strategy that balances clearance, protection, and repair for osteosarcoma.








Abstract
Osteosarcoma is one of the most dreadful bone neoplasms in young people, necessitating the development of innovative therapies that can effectively eliminate tumors while minimizing damage to limb function. An ideal therapeutic strategy should possess three essential capabilities: antitumor effects, tissue&#8208;protective properties, and the ability to enhance osteogenesis. In this study, self&#8208;assembled Ce&#8208;substituted molybdenum blue (CMB) nanowheel crystals are synthesized and loaded onto 3D&#8208;printed bioactive glass (CMB@BG) scaffolds to develop a unique three&#8208;in&#8208;one treatment approach for osteosarcoma. The CMB@BG scaffolds exhibit outstanding photothermally derived tumor ablation within the near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II window due to the surface plasmon resonance properties of the CMB nanowheel crystals. Furthermore, the photothermally synergistic catalytic effect of CMB promotes the rapid scavenging of reactive oxygen species caused by excessive heat, thereby suppressing inflammation and protecting surrounding tissues. The CMB@BG scaffolds possess pro&#8208;proliferation and pro&#8208;differentiation capabilities that efficiently accelerate bone regeneration within bone defects. Altogether, the CMB@BG scaffolds that combine highly efficient tumor ablation, tissue protection based on anti&#8208;inflammatory mechanisms, and enhanced osteogenic ability are likely to be a point&#8208;to&#8208;point solution for the comprehensive therapeutic needs of osteosarcoma.

         <title>An Efficient Trifunctional Spinel&#8208;Based Electrode for Oxygen Reduction/Evolution Reactions and Nonoxidative Ethane Dehydrogenation on Protonic Ceramic Electrochemical Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here a novel spinel&#8208;based composite of Mn0.9Cs0.1Co2O4&#8208;&#948; (MCCO)&#8208;Co3O4 (CO) (MCCO&#8208;CO, 8:2 in mass ratio) oxide is reported as a trifunctional electrode for electricity generation and ethylene electro&#8208;production on protonic ceramic electrochemical cells.








Abstract
Protonic ceramic electrochemical cells (PCECs) have received considerable attention as they can directly generate electricity and/or produce chemicals. Development of the electrodes with the trifunctionalities of oxygen reduction/evolution and nonoxidative ethane dehydrogenation is yet challenging. Here these findings are reported in the design of trifunctional electrodes for PCECs with a detailed composition of Mn0.9Cs0.1Co2O4&#8208;&#948; (MCCO) and Co3O4 (CO) (MCCO&#8211;CO, 8:2 mass ratio). At 600&#160;&#176;C, the MCCO&#8211;CO electrode exhibits a low area&#8208;specific resistance of 0.382 &#937; cm2 and reasonable stability for &#8776;105&#160;h with no obvious degradation. The single cell with the MCCO&#8211;CO electrode shows an encouraging peak power density of 1.73&#160;W cm&#8722;2 in the fuel cell (FC) mode and a current density of &#8208;3.93 A cm&#8722;2 at 1.3&#160;V in the electrolysis cell (EC) mode at 700&#160;&#176;C. Moreover, the MCCO&#8211;CO cell displays promising operational stability in FC mode (223&#160;h), EC mode (209&#160;h), and reversible cycling stability (52 cycles, 208&#160;h) at 650&#160;&#176;C. The MCCO&#8211;CO single cell shows an encouraging ethane&#160;conversion to ethylene (with a conversion of 40.3% and selectivity of 94%) and excellent H2 production rates of 4.65&#160;mL min&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at 1.5&#160;V and 700&#160;&#176;C, respectively, with reasonable Faradaic efficiencies.

         <title>Enriched Oxygen Coverage Localized within Ir Atomic Grids for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic grid structure with high&#8208;density Ir sites (&#8776;10 atoms per nm2) on MnO2&#8211;x support realizes co&#8208;catalytic Ir&#8211;Mn interaction in water oxidation process, involving enriched oxygen coverage driven by Mn&#8208;Ov coordination defects to cooperate with highly electrophilic Ir&#8211;O(II&#8208;&#948;)&#8722; species, which facilitates intensive O&#8211;O radical direct coupling within the grids for performance enhancement.








Abstract
Inefficient active site utilization of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts have limited the energy efficiency of proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis. Here, an atomic grid structure is demonstrated composed of high&#8208;density Ir sites (&#8776;10&#160;atoms per nm2) on reactive MnO2&#8211;x support which mediates oxygen coverage&#8208;enhanced OER process. Experimental characterizations verify the low&#8208;valent Mn species with decreased oxygen coordination in MnO2&#8211;x exert a pivotal impact in the enriched oxygen coverage on the surface during OER process, and the distributed Ir atomic grids, where highly electrophilic Ir&#9472;O(II&#8208;&#948;)&#8722; bonds proceed rapidly, render intense nucleophilic attack of oxygen radicals. Thereby, this metal&#8208;support cooperation achieves ultra&#8208;low overpotentials of 166&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 283&#160;mV at 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, together with a striking mass activity which is 380 times higher than commercial IrO2 at 1.53&#160;V. Moreover, its high OER performance also markedly surpasses the commercial Ir black catalyst in PEM electrolyzers with long&#8208;term stability.

         <title>Bio&#8208;inspired Mechanically Responsive Smart Windows for Visible and Near&#8208;Infrared Multiwavelength Spectral Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A feasible layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly strategy is proposed toward large&#8208;area fabricating mechanically responsive film for VIS and NIR multiwavelength spectral modulation smart windows. The excellent mechanical and optical cycling stability of the composite film provide a favorable basis for their practical applications. Furthermore, these spectral selective and dynamic smart windows will provide suitable solutions for the decarbonization of buildings.








Abstract
Mechanochromic light control technology that can dynamically regulate solar irradiation is recognized as one of the leading candidates for energy&#8208;saving windows. However, the lack of spectrally selective modulation ability still hinders its application for different scenarios or individual needs. Here, inspired by the generation of structure color and color change of living organisms, a simple layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly approach toward large&#8208;area fabricating mechanically responsive film for visible and near&#8208;infrared multiwavelength spectral modulation smart windows is reported here. The assembled SiO2 nanoparticles&#160;and W18O49 nanowires enable the film with an optical modulation rate of up to 42.4% at the wavelength of 550&#160;nm and 18.4% for the near&#8208;infrared region, separately, and the typical composite film under 50% stretching shows &#8776;41.6% modulation rate at the wavelength of 550&#160;nm with NIR modulation rate less than 2.7%. More importantly, the introduction of the multilayer assembly structure not only optimizes the film's optical modulation but also enables the film with high stability during 100&#160;000 stretching cycles. A cooling effect of 21.3 and 6.9 &#176;C for the blackbody and air inside a model house in the real environmental application is achieved. This approach provides theoretical and technical support for the new mechanochromic energy&#8208;saving windows.

         <title>Multifunctional Metamaterial with Reconfigurable Electromagnetic Scattering Properties for Advanced Stealth and Adaptive Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bistable condition of the curved beam and design is studied with wave&#8208;absorbing metamaterials. So it has the bistable characteristic and the ability to absorb bandwidth switching. The absorbing mechanism is explained through the macroscopic and microscopic levels. The adjustable form is enriched with digital coding and applied to the satellite configuration to realize the reconstruction function of electromagnetic scattering properties.








Abstract
The rapid development of radar detection systems has led to an increased sensitivity to the electromagnetic (EM) scattering properties of detected targets. Flexible and adaptable EM scattering properties significantly enhance the survivability of battlefield weapons. This paper presents the design of a novel multifunctional metamaterial with reconfigurable EM scattering properties based on a bistable curved beam. In addition to the cushioning and energy absorption properties of curved beams, the metamaterial achieves more than 90% EM absorption in the frequency range of 2.17&#8211;17.31&#160;GHz, with a relative thickness of only 0.09&#955;L. The bistable nature of the metamaterial allows it to switch between different states. Moreover, combined with the digital coding, this metamaterial can continuously adjust the absorbing bandwidth and further enhance the EM absorption rate within a specific frequency band range. If applied to satellite configurations, the developed metamaterial significantly reduces the radar cross section and offers potential applications in reconfiguring EM scattering properties, when applied to satellite configurations. By actively controller and reconstructing the EM scattering properties at certain frequency points, the metamaterial can achieve camouflage, providing innovative solutions for future stealth technology, electronic countermeasures, and deception jamming in radar detection.

         <title>Water&#8208;Templated Growth of Interfacial Superglue Polymers for Tunable Thin Films and In Situ Fluid Encapsulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
WRAPPINGS is an eco&#8208;friendly concept that delivers thin poly(cyanoacrylate) films with precisely engineered properties. Exposing a water surface containing cationic surfactants to superglue vapors results in a film with tailored thickness, shape, and color. Using drops and bubbles as templates for film growth, the in situ packaging of chemical and biological liquid cargos and the encapsulation of gases is demonstrated.








Abstract
Thin polymer films (TPFs) are indispensable elements in numerous technologies ranging from liquid encapsulation to biotechnology to electronics. However, their production typically relies on wet chemistry involving organic solvents or chemical vapor deposition, necessitating elaborate equipment and often harsh conditions. Here, an eco&#8208;friendly, fast, and facile synthesis of water&#8208;templated interfacial polymers based on cyanoacrylates (superglues, CAs) that yield thin films with tailored properties is demonstrated. Specifically, by exposing a cationic surfactant&#8208;laden water surface to cyanoacrylate vapors, surfactant&#8208;modulated anionic polymerization produces a manipulable thin polymer film with a thickness growth rate of 8&#160;nm&#160;min&#8722;1. Furthermore, the shape and color of the film are precisely controlled by the polymerization kinetics, wetting conditions, and/or exposure to patterned light. Using various interfaces as templates for film growth, including the free surface of drops and soap bubbles, the developed method advantageously enables in situ packaging of chemical and biological cargos in liquid phase as well as the encapsulation of gases within solidified bubbles. Simple, versatile, and biocompatible, this technology constitutes a potent platform for programmable coating and soft/smart encapsulation of fluids.

         <title>Uncovering the Intrinsic High Fracture Toughness of Titanium via Lowered Oxygen Impurity Content</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here it is revealed that the low&#8208;oxygen titanium (Ti) has an intrinsic fracture toughness of 255 MPa m1/2. The low oxygen concentration promotes deformation twinning, and the numerous twin boundaries further stimulate the &#12296;c+a&#12297; slip at the crack tip. The operation of these two &#12296;c&#12297;&#8208;axis deformation modes enhances the uniform deformation abilities, resulting in a remarkable leap in fracture resistance of Ti.








Abstract
Titanium (Ti) and its alloys are known to exhibit room&#8208;temperature fracture toughness below 130 MPa m1/2, only about one half of the best austenitic stainless steels. It is purported that this is not the best possible fracture resistance of Ti, but a result of oxygen impurities that sensitively retard the activities of plasticity carriers in this hexagonal close&#8208;packed metal. By a reduction of oxygen content from the 0.14&#160;wt% in commercial purity Ti to 0.02&#160;wt%, the mode&#8208;&#921; fracture toughness of the low&#8208;oxygen Ti is measured to be as high as KJIc &#8776; 255 MPa m1/2, corresponding to J&#8208;integral&#8208;based crack&#8208;initiation toughness of up to JIc &#8776; 537&#160;kJ m&#8722;2. This extraordinary toughness, reported here for the first time for pure Ti, places Ti among the toughest known materials. The intrinsic high fracture resistance is attributed to the profuse plastic deformation in a significantly enlarged plastic zone, rendered by the pronounced deformation twinning ahead of the crack tip along with ample twin&#8208;stimulated &#12296;c+a&#12297; dislocation activities, in the absence of impeding oxygen. Controlling the content of a property&#8208;controlling impurity thus holds the promise to be a readily applicable strategy to reach for unprecedented damage tolerance in some other structural alloys.

         <title>SonoPrint: Acoustically Assisted Volumetric 3D Printing for Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
SonoPrint merges sound energy with volumetric printing to create composite materials with aligned reinforcement patterning. This innovative 3D printing technique embeds particles such as glass, metal, and polystyrene into photosensitive resin, forming intricate motifs and mechanically tunable geometries. Completing prints in minutes, SonoPrint enhances structural properties and advances applications in biohybrid robots, tissue engineering, and composite fabrication, broadening the horizons of volumetric printing.








Abstract
Advances in additive manufacturing in composites have transformed aerospace, medical devices, tissue engineering, and electronics. A key aspect of enhancing properties of 3D&#8208;printed objects involves fine&#8208;tuning the material by embedding and orienting reinforcement within the structure. Existing methods for orienting these reinforcements are limited by pattern types, alignment, and particle characteristics. Acoustics offers a versatile method to control the particles independent of their size, geometry, and charge, enabling intricate pattern formations. However, integrating acoustics into 3D printing has been challenging due to the scattering of the acoustic field between polymerized layers and unpolymerized resin, resulting in unwanted patterns. To address this challenge, SonoPrint, an innovative acoustically assisted volumetric 3D printer is developed that enables simultaneous reinforcement patterning and printing of the entire structure. SonoPrint generates mechanically tunable composite geometries by embedding reinforcement particles, such as microscopic glass, metal, and polystyrene, within the fabricated structure. This printer employs a standing wave field to create targeted particle motifs&#8208;including parallel lines, radial lines, circles, rhombuses, hexagons, and polygons&#8208;directly in the photosensitive resin, completing the print in just a few minutes. SonoPrint enhances structural properties and promises to advance volumetric printing, unlocking applications in tissue engineering, biohybrid robots, and composite fabrication.

A novel photoswitchable cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;spiropyran host&#8211;guest complex is designed to exhibit fast and reversible switching of binding ratios between 1:2 and 1:1 in response to UV and blue light. Such photoswitchable complexation stoichiometries are rationally exploited as (de)crosslinking units in multiple polymers for the design of supramolecular hydrogels displaying highly dynamic and switchable features that are spatiotemporally controlled by light.








Abstract
The integration of photoswitchable supramolecular units into hydrogels allows for spatiotemporal control over their nanoscale topological network and macroscale properties using light. Nevertheless, the current availability of photoswitchable supramolecular interactions for the development of such materials remains limited. Here, the molecular design of a novel photoswitchable cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;spiropyran host&#8211;guest complex exhibiting fast and reversible switching of binding ratios between 1:2 and 1:1 is reported. Photoswitchable complexation stoichiometries are rationally exploited as (de)crosslinking units in multiple polymers for the design of supramolecular hydrogels displaying highly dynamic and switchable features that are spatiotemporally controlled by light. The hydrogels exhibit rapid reversible mechanical softening&#8208;hardening upon alternating irradiation with blue and UV light, which is used to significantly accelerate and improve the efficiency of self&#8208;healing and shape&#8208;remolding of hydrogels. Furthermore, spiropyran endows such materials with unique reversible photochromic properties for reproducible patterning/erasing and information storage. Using a dual&#8208;light&#8208;assisted extrusion process, meter&#8208;scale hydrogel fibers with enhanced structural integrity and photoswitchable ionic conductivity are constructed and woven into various slidable knots and fluorescent shapes. This work represents an innovative molecular design strategy for advancing the development of spatiotemporally engineered supramolecular hydrogels using light and opens avenues for their prospective applications in dynamic materials and adaptive systems.

         <title>Biomimetic Nanomodulators With Synergism of Photothermal Therapy and Vessel Normalization for Boosting Potent Anticancer Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomimetic nanomodulator Tm@PDA&#8208;GA with homologous targeting is developed for boosting potent anticancer immunity. Especially Tm@PDA&#8208;GA inhibits HSPs expression for chemo&#8208;photothermal synergetic anti&#8208;tumor and increases ICD to promote the maturation of dendritic cells. Additionally, it normalizes the vessels via HIF&#8208;1&#945; and VEGF inhibition to enhance immune infiltration. So Tm@PDA&#8208;GA combined with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 can effectively suppress tumor growth and lung metastasis.








Abstract
Combination therapy using photothermal therapy (PTT) and immunotherapy is one of the most promising approaches for eliciting host immune responses to ablate tumors. However, its therapeutic efficacy is limited due to inefficient immune cell infiltration and cellular immune responses. In this study, a biomimetic immunostimulatory nanomodulator, Tm@PDA&#8208;GA (4T1 membrane@polydopamine&#8208;gambogic acid), with homologous targeting is developed. The 4T1 membrane (Tm) coating reduced immunogenicity and facilitated uptake of Tm@PDA&#8208;GA by tumor cells. Polydopamine (PDA) as a drug carrier can induce PTT under near&#8208;infrared ray (NIR) irradiation and immunogenic cell death (ICD) to activate dendritic cells (DCs). Moreover, Tm@PDA&#8208;GA on&#8208;demand released gambogic acid (GA) in an acidic tumor microenvironment, inhibiting the expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs) for synergetic chemo&#8208;photothermal anti&#8208;tumor activity and increasing the ICD of 4T1 cells. More importantly, GA can normalize the vessels via HIF&#8208;1&#945; and VEGF inhibition to enhance immune infiltration and alleviate hypoxia stress. Thus, Tm@PDA&#8208;GA induced ICD, activated DCs, stimulated cytotoxic T cells, and suppressed Tregs. Moreover, Tm@PDA&#8208;GA is combined with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 to further augment the tumor immune response and effectively suppress tumor growth and lung metastasis. In conclusion, biomaterial&#8208;mediated PTT combined with vessel normalization is a promising strategy for effective immunotherapy of triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC).

         <title>Direct Chiral Discrimination with NMR</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) elucidates molecular structures down to the atomic level. However, only with an auxiliary molecule, it is currently possible to distinguish the handedness of enantiomers directly with NMR. NMR is normally blind to chirality. A newly developed method now allows the distinction of enantiomers, just by using a standard NMR instrument, and without adulteration of the sample under investigation.








Abstract
Unaided nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is considered incapable of distinguishing enantiomers. However, as first derived by A.D. Buckingham, the tensor coupling the electric and magnetic dipoles is space&#8208;dependent, which varies according to the molecular structure, hence, would be different for two enantiomers. Exploiting the odd&#8208;parity coupling tensor, a new variant of a double&#8208;resonant radiofrequency (RF) NMR detector is developed, which is sensitive to both electric and magnetic dipoles. Using the detector, a new method for liquid&#8208;state NMR is developed and elaborated, with which two enantiomers are successfully discriminated.

         <title>Enhanced Self&#8211;Assembly and Spontaneous Separation for Ultrathin, Air&#8210;Floating Graphene Macrofilms and their Application in Ultrasensitive In&#8208;Site Growth Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By means of ethanol&#8208;based binary solution, the self&#8208;assembly performance of graphene oxide is enhanced dramatically at air&#8211;liquid interface, and the formed graphene oxide film first separates spontaneously from the solution to obtain an ultrathin air&#8210;floating graphene macrofilm (AGF). The in situ growth sensors based on AGFs are fabricated and show quick response and ultrahigh sensitivity for temperature and slight disturbance.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled graphene films at air&#8208;liquid interface have great potential for multiple applications. However, the large size and ultrathin thickness for graphene&#8208;based films are hardly achieved simultaneously because of poor assembly ability of graphene oxide (GO) and cautious film transfer process (FTP). Herein, the ethanol&#8208;based binary solution with supramolecular clusters and weak polarity is introduced to enhance the assembly performance of GO. In this regime, GO film is formed within 52 s, and its formation temperature can be as low as &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C. More importantly, the attractive force between the formed GO film and this binary solution is 62% lower than that between GO film and traditional aqueous solution. On this basis, for the first time a spontaneous separation of the self&#8208;assembled GO film from solution is reported, and the air&#8210;floating graphene films (AGFs) with nanoscale thickness and centimeter&#8208;scale diameter are prepared without FTP. By means of this separation behavior, the in situ growth AGFs sensors are fabricated, and they express fast response and ultrahigh sensitivity to imperceptible change in temperature and disturbances that are hardly recognized by common sensors. Therefore, a new accessible strategy is demonstrated to prepare ultrathin graphene macrofilms, which can be the excellent candidates for multifunctional, ultrasensitive sensors.

         <title>Densification of Cathode/Electrolyte Interphase to Enhance Reversibility of LiCoO2 at 4.65&#160;V</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A progressively reinforced cathode/electrolyte interphase (CEI) is realized via constructing Zr&#9472;O deposits (ZrO2 and Li2ZrO3) on Z&#8208;LCO, i.e. the fluorination of Zr&#9472;O and densification of CEI layer driven by the chemical reaction between ZrOxFy and LiF, greatly reinforcing the toughness of CEI containing inorganic species. Consequently, Z&#8208;LCO achieve an enhanced and reversible O3/H1&#8208;3 phase transition and excellent electrochemical performance at 4.6/4.65 V.








Abstract
For LiCoO2 (LCO) operated beyond 4.55&#160;V (vs Li/Li+), it usually suffers from severe surface degradation. Constructing a robust cathode/electrolyte interphase (CEI) is effective to alleviate the above issues, however, the correlated mechanisms still remain vague. Herein, a progressively reinforced CEI is realized via constructing Zr&#9472;O deposits (ZrO2 and Li2ZrO3) on LCO surface (i.e., Z&#8208;LCO). Upon cycle, these Zr&#9472;O deposits can promote the decomposition of LiPF6, and progressively convert to the highly dispersed Zr&#9472;O&#9472;F species. In particular, the chemical reaction between LiF and Zr&#9472;O&#9472;F species further leads to the densification of CEI, which greatly reinforces its toughness and conductivity. Combining the robust CEI and thin surface rock&#8208;salt layer of Z&#8208;LCO, several benefits are achieved, including stabilizing the surface lattice oxygen, facilitating the interface Li+ transport kinetics, and enhancing the reversibility of O3/H1&#8208;3 phase transition, etc. As a result, the Z&#8208;LCO||Li cells exhibit a high capacity retention of 84.2% after 1000 cycles in 3&#8211;4.65&#160;V, 80.9% after 1500 cycles in 3&#8211;4.6&#160;V, and a high rate capacity of 160&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 16 C (1 C&#160;=&#160;200&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1). This work provides a new insight for developing advanced LCO cathodes.

&lt;p&gt;For LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (LCO) operated beyond 4.55&#160;V (vs Li/Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), it usually suffers from severe surface degradation. Constructing a robust cathode/electrolyte interphase (CEI) is effective to alleviate the above issues, however, the correlated mechanisms still remain vague. Herein, a progressively reinforced CEI is realized via constructing Zr&#9472;O deposits (ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ZrO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) on LCO surface (i.e., Z-LCO). Upon cycle, these Zr&#9472;O deposits can promote the decomposition of LiPF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, and progressively convert to the highly dispersed Zr&#9472;O&#9472;F species. In particular, the chemical reaction between LiF and Zr&#9472;O&#9472;F species further leads to the densification of CEI, which greatly reinforces its toughness and conductivity. Combining the robust CEI and thin surface rock-salt layer of Z-LCO, several benefits are achieved, including stabilizing the surface lattice oxygen, facilitating the interface Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport kinetics, and enhancing the reversibility of O3/H1-3 phase transition, etc. As a result, the Z-LCO||Li cells exhibit a high capacity retention of 84.2% after 1000 cycles in 3&#8211;4.65&#160;V, 80.9% after 1500 cycles in 3&#8211;4.6&#160;V, and a high rate capacity of 160&#160;mAh&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 16 C (1 C&#160;=&#160;200&#160;mA&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). This work provides a new insight for developing advanced LCO cathodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultralong K0.5Mn0.75PS3 Nanowires Tailored by K&#8208;Ion Scissors for Extraordinary Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>

The concept of &#8220;K&#8208;ion scissors&#8221; is proposed for the first time to achieve rapid transformation of MnPS3 bulk to K0.5Mn0.75PS3 nanowires with extraordinary sodium storage performance.








Abstract
1D&#160;layered nanowires (NWs) are expected to be excellent electrode materials due to their efficient electron/ion transport and strain/stress relaxation. However, it is a great challenge to synthesize layered NWs by a top&#8208;down synthetic route. Herein, ultralong 1D layered K0.5Mn0.75PS3 NWs (length: &gt;100&#160;&#181;m; diameter: &#8776;300&#160;nm) are synthesized for the first time using &#8220;K&#8208;ion chemical scissors&#8221;, whose excellent sodium storage performance originates from the bifunctional structural unit, ingeniously combining the alloying energy storage functional unit (P&#8722;P dimer) with the quasi&#8208;intercalated functional unit ([MnS3]4&#8722; framework). Stress&#8208;driven K&#8208;ion scissors achieve the rapid transformation of MnPS3 bulk to K0.5Mn0.75PS3 NWs with directed tailoring. Compared to MnPS3, the NWs exhibit enlarged interlayer spacing (9.32 &#197;), enhanced electronic conductivity (8.17&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;5 S m&#8722;1 vs 4.47&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;10 S m&#8722;1), and high ionic conductivity (2.14 mS cm&#8722;1). As expected, the NWs demonstrate high capacity (709 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 A g&#8722;1) and excellent cycling performance (&#8776;100% capacity retention after 2500 cycles at 10 A g&#8722;1), ranking among metal thiophosphates. A quasi&#8208;topological intercalation mechanism of the NWs is revealed through further characterizations. This work expands the top&#8208;down synthesis approach and offers innovative insights for the cost&#8208;effective and large&#8208;scale fabrication of NWs with outstanding electrochemical performance.

         <title>Leidenfrost Effect&#8208;Induced Chaotic Vortex Flow for Efficient Mixing of Highly Viscous Droplets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;efficiency mixing of viscous liquids in microfluidics manipulation is a long&#8208;standing challenge because of unfavorable diffusion kinetics. Here, a peculiar Leidenfrost phenomenon, which can achieve mixing of viscous droplets within several hundred ms due to internal vortex motion, is resorted to. This new mixing mechanism can be used to synthesize nanoparticles of the desired morphology.








Abstract
Efficiently mixing highly viscous liquids in microfluidic systems is appealing for green chemistry such as chemical synthesis and catalysis, but it is a long&#8208;standing challenge owing to the unfavorable diffusion kinetics. In this work, a new strategy is explored for mixing viscous droplets by harnessing a peculiar Leidenfrost state, where the substrate temperature is above the boiling point of the liquid without apparent liquid evaporation. Compared to the control experiment where the droplet stays at a similar temperature but in the contact boiling regime, the mixing time can be reduced significantly. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the liquid mixing originates from the chaotic convection flow in the Leidenfrost droplet, characterized by the internal vortex motion evidenced by the microscale visualization. A correlation between mixing time and droplet volume is also proposed, showing a good agreement with experimental results. It is further shown that Leidenfrost droplets can be used to synthesize nanoparticles of the desired morphology, and it is anticipated that this simple and scalable fabrication approach will find applications in the biological, pharmaceutical, and chemical industries.

         <title>Anisotropic Superprotonic Conduction in a Layered Single&#8208;Component Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework with Multiple In&#8208;Plane Open Channels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>

A layered single&#8208;component hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF), HOF&#8208;TPB&#8208;A3, is prepared, which exhibited anisotropic superprotonic conduction via multiple in&#8208;plane open channels. A&#160;proton rectifier device is further demonstrated, highlighting the promise of HOFs as conducting media for ionic devices.








Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) are promising proton conductive materials because of their inherent and abundant hydrogen&#8208;bonding sites. However, most superprotonic&#8208;conductive HOFs are constructed from multiple components to enable favorable framework architectures and structural integrity. In this contribution, layered HOF&#8208;TPB&#8208;A3 with a single component is synthesized and exfoliated. The exfoliated nanoplates exhibited anisotropic superprotonic conduction, with in&#8208;plane proton conductivities reaching 1.34&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2 S cm&#8722;1 at 296 K and 98% relative humidity (RH). This outperforms the previously reported single&#8208;component HOFs and is comparable with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art multiple&#8208;component HOFs. The high and anisotropic proton conductive properties can be attributed to the efficient proton transport along multiple open channels parallel to their basal planes. Moreover, an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state (ASS) proton rectifier device is demonstrated by combining HOF&#8208;TPB&#8208;A3 and a hydroxide ion&#8208;conducting layered double hydroxide (LDH). This work suggests that single&#8208;component HOFs with multiple open channels offer more opportunities as versatile platforms for proton conductors, making them promising candidates for conducting media in protonic devices.

         <title>All&#8208;in&#8208;One 2D Molecular Crystal Optoelectronic Synapse for Polarization&#8208;Sensitive Neuromorphic Visual System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pioneering all&#8208;in&#8208;one 2D molecular crystal (2DMC) optoelectronic synapse for polarization&#8208;sensitive neuromorphic visual system is demonstrated. The synaptic phototransistor exhibits remarkable photoelectric performance and simulates biological synapse functions. The in&#8208;plane crystal anisotropy of 2DMC endows the synaptic phototransistor with polarization perception capabilities, which is successfully applied to noncontact fingerprint detection with a high recognition accuracy.








Abstract
Neuromorphic visual systems (NVSs) hold the potential to not only preserve but also enhance human visual capabilities. One such augmentation lies in harnessing polarization information from light reflected or scattered off surfaces like bees, which can disclose unique characteristics imperceptible to the human eyes. While creating polarization&#8208;sensitive optoelectronic synapses presents an intriguing avenue for equipping NVS with this capability, integrating functions like polarization sensitivity, photodetection, and synaptic operations into a singular device has proven challenging. This integration typically necessitates distinct functional components for each performance metric, leading to intricate fabrication processes and constraining overall performance. Herein, a pioneering linear polarized light sensitive synaptic organic phototransistor (OPT) based on 2D molecular crystals (2DMCs) with highly integrated, all&#8208;in&#8208;one functionality, is demonstrated. By leveraging the superior crystallinity and molecular thinness of 2DMC, the synaptic OPT exhibits comprehensive superior performance, including a linear dichroic ratio up to 3.85, a high responsivity of 1.47 &#215; 104 A W&#8722;1, and the adept emulation of biological synapse functions. A sophisticated application in noncontact fingerprint detection achieves a 99.8% recognition accuracy, further highlights its potential. The all&#8208;in&#8208;one 2DMC optoelectronic synapse for polarization&#8208;sensitive NVS marks a new era for intelligent perception systems.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuromorphic visual systems (NVSs) hold the potential to not only preserve but also enhance human visual capabilities. One such augmentation lies in harnessing polarization information from light reflected or scattered off surfaces like bees, which can disclose unique characteristics imperceptible to the human eyes. While creating polarization-sensitive optoelectronic synapses presents an intriguing avenue for equipping NVS with this capability, integrating functions like polarization sensitivity, photodetection, and synaptic operations into a singular device has proven challenging. This integration typically necessitates distinct functional components for each performance metric, leading to intricate fabrication processes and constraining overall performance. Herein, a pioneering linear polarized light sensitive synaptic organic phototransistor (OPT) based on 2D molecular crystals (2DMCs) with highly integrated, all-in-one functionality, is demonstrated. By leveraging the superior crystallinity and molecular thinness of 2DMC, the synaptic OPT exhibits comprehensive superior performance, including a linear dichroic ratio up to 3.85, a high responsivity of 1.47 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; A W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and the adept emulation of biological synapse functions. A sophisticated application in noncontact fingerprint detection achieves a 99.8% recognition accuracy, further highlights its potential. The all-in-one 2DMC optoelectronic synapse for polarization-sensitive NVS marks a new era for intelligent perception systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Biomimetic Autophagosomes&#8208;Based Nanovaccine Boosts Anticancer Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a biomimetic autophagosome&#8208;based (BAPs) personalized nanovaccine that integrates neoantigens sourced from tumor cell&#8208;derived autophagosomes, immunoadjuvants, and targeting nanovesicles to induce a potent tumor&#8208;specific immune response. The BAPs nanovaccine demonstrates significant efficacy in eradicating established tumors, providing comprehensive protection to mice against tumor rechallenges, and decreasing tumor incidence. This represents a highly versatile formulation for personalized cancer immunotherapy.








Abstract
Personalized cancer vaccines based on tumor cell lysates offer promise for cancer immunotherapy yet fail to elicit a robust therapeutic effect due to the weak immunogenicity of tumor antigens. Autophagosomes, obtained from pleural effusions and ascites of cancer patients, have been identified as abundant reservoirs of tumor neoantigens that exhibit heightened immunogenicity. However, their potential as personalized cancer vaccines have been constrained by suboptimal lymphatic&#8208;targeting performances and challenges in antigen&#8208;presenting cell endocytosis. Here,a reinforced biomimetic autophagosome&#8208;based (BAPs) nanovaccine generated by precisely amalgamating autophagosome&#8208;derived neoantigens and two types of adjuvants capable of targeting lymph nodes is developed to potently elicit antitumor immunity. The redox&#8208;responsive BAPs facilitate cytosolic vaccine opening within antigen&#8208;presenting cells, thereby exposing adjuvants and antigens to stimulate a strong immune response. BAPs evoke broad&#8208;spectrum T&#8208;cell responses, culminating in the effective eradication of 71.4% of established tumors. Notably, BAPs vaccination triggers enduring T&#8208;cell responses that confer robust protection, with 100% of mice shielded against tumor rechallenge and a significant reduction in tumor incidence by 87.5%. Furthermore, BAPs synergize with checkpoint blockade therapy to inhibit tumor growth in the poorly immunogenic breast cancer model. The biomimetic approach presents a powerful nanovaccine formula with high versatility&#160;for personalized cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Simultaneous Color&#8208; and Dose&#8208;Controlled Thiol&#8211;Ene Resins for Multimodulus 3D Printing with Programmable Interfacial Gradients</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>

Exposing a novel multifunctional resin to different colors and intensities of light enables 3D printing of high&#8208;resolution objects with programmable stiffness gradients that are mimetic of structures found in nature.








Abstract
Drawing inspiration from nature's own intricate designs, synthetic multimaterial structures have the potential to offer properties and functionality that exceed those of the individual components. However, several contemporary hurdles, from a lack of efficient chemistries to processing constraints, preclude the rapid and precise manufacturing of such materials. Herein, the development of a photocurable resin comprising color&#8208;selective initiators is reported, triggering disparate polymerization mechanisms between acrylate and thiol functionality. Exposure of the resin to UV light (365&#160;nm) leads to the formation of a rigid, highly crosslinked network via a radical chain&#8208;growth mechanism, while violet light (405&#160;nm) forms a soft, lightly crosslinked network via an anionic step&#8208;growth mechanism. The efficient photocurable resin is employed in multicolor digital light processing 3D printing to provide structures with moduli spanning over two orders of magnitude. Furthermore, local intensity (i.e., grayscale) control enables the formation of programmable stiffness gradients with &#8776;150&#215; change in modulus occurring across sharp (&#8776;200&#160;&#181;m) and shallow (&#8776;9&#160;mm) interfaces, mimetic of the human knee entheses and squid beaks, respectively. This study provides composition&#8211;processing&#8211;property relationships to inform advanced manufacturing of next&#8208;generation multimaterial objects having a myriad of applications from healthcare to education.

         <title>Implantable Microneedle&#8208;Mediated Eradication of Postoperative Tumor Foci Mitigates Glioblastoma Relapse</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biodegradable and immunomodulatory microneedle (GMAN@CMN) is reported in this work. As an adjunctive strategy for the treatment of GBM, GMAN@CMN initiates anti&#8208;tumor immunity and effectively prevents GBM postoperative relapse. The implantable microneedle even holds potential when the tumor invades vital regions that cannot be surgically resected.








Abstract
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) remains incurable despite multimodal treatments after surgical debulking. Almost all patients with GBM relapse within a narrow margin (2&#8211;3&#160;cm) of the initial resected lesion due to the unreachable residual cancerous cells. Here, a completely biodegradable microneedle for surgical cavity delivery glioblastoma&#8208;associated macrophages (GAMs)&#8208;activating immune nano&#8208;stimulator that mitigates glioblastoma relapse is reported. The residual tumor lesion&#8208;directed biocompatible microneedle releases the nano&#8208;stimulator and toll&#8208;like receptor 9 agonist in a controlled manner until the microneedles completely degrade over 1 week, efferently induce in situ phonotypic shifting of GAMs from anti&#8208; to pro&#8208;inflammatory and the tumor recurrence is obviously inhibited. The implantable microneedles offer a significant improvement over conventional transdermal ones, as they are 100% degradable, ensuring safe application within surgical cavities. It is also revealed that the T cells are recruited to the tumor niche as the GAMs initiate anti&#8208;tumor response and eradicate residual GBM cells. Taken together, this work provides a potential strategy for immunomodulating the postoperative tumor niche to mitigate tumor relapse in GBM patients, which may have broad applications in other malignancies with surgical intervention.

         <title>Achieving Near&#8208;Infrared Phosphorescence Supramolecular Hydrogel Based on Amphiphilic Bromonaphthalimide Pyridinium Hierarchical Assembly</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient near&#8208;infrared phosphorescence supramolecular hydrogel is constructed based on amphiphilic bromonaphthalimide pyridinium hierarchical assembly in aqueous medium, which exhibits long&#8208;lived photoluminescence at 823&#160;nm with ultralarge Stokes shift and is successfully applied for cell labeling.








Abstract
Phosphorescent supramolecular hydrogels are currently a prevalent topic for their great promise in various photonic applications. Herein, an efficient near&#8208;infrared (NIR) phosphorescence supramolecular hydrogel is reported via the hierarchical assembly strategy in aqueous solution, which is fabricated from amphiphilic bromonaphthalimide pyridinium derivative (G), exfoliated Laponite (LP) nanosheets, and polymeric polyacrylamide (PAAm). Initially, G spontaneously self&#8208;aggregates into spherical nanoparticles covered with positively charged pyridinium units and emits single fluorescence at 410&#160;nm. Driven by electrostatic interactions with negatively charged nanosheets, the nanoparticles subsequently function as the cross&#8208;linked binders and coassemble with LP into supramolecular hydrogels with an engendered red room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) up to 620&#160;nm. Benefiting from hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions&#8208;mediated physical cross&#8208;linkage, the further introduction of PAAm not only significantly elevates the mechanical strength of the hydrogels showing fast self&#8208;healing capability, but also increases phosphorescence lifetime from 2.49&#160;to 4.20&#160;ms, especially generating phosphorescence at even higher temperature (&#964;
363 K = 2.46&#160;ms). Additionally, efficient RTP energy transfer occurs after doping a small amount of organic dye heptamethine cyanine (IR780) as an acceptor into hydrogels, resulting in a long&#8208;lived NIR emission at 823&#160;nm with a high donor/acceptor ratio, which is successfully applied for cell labeling in the NIR window.

         <title>In&#8208;Materia Annealing and Combinatorial Optimization Based on Vertical Memristive Array</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study utilizes the inter&#8208;layer interference of a vertically stacked memristive crossbar array as an annealing method for combinatorial optimization problems. When these problems are mapped into the CBA's configuration layer, decaying annealing profiles are generated in the adjacent noise layers. The annealing profiles can be controlled electrically, offering material&#8208;based noise to solve the problems efficiently. 








Abstract
Due to its area and energy efficiency, a memristive crossbar array (CBA) has been extensively studied for various combinatorial optimization applications, from network problems to circuit design. However, conventional approaches include heavily burdening software fine&#8208;tuning for the annealing process. Instead, this study introduces the &#8220;in&#8208;materia annealing&#8221; method, where the inter&#8208;layer interference of vertically stacked memristive CBA is utilized as an annealing method. When mapping combinatorial optimization problems into the configuration layer of the CBA, exponentially decaying annealing profiles are generated in nearby noise layers. Moreover, in&#8208;materia annealing profiles can be controlled by changing compliance current, read voltage, and read pulse width. Therefore, the annealing profiles can be arbitrarily controlled and generated individually for each cell, providing rich noise sources to solve the problem efficiently. Consequently, the experimental and simulation of Max&#8208;Cut and weighted Max&#8208;Cut problems achieve notable results with the minimum software burden.

         <title>Cu&#8208;In Dual Sites with Sulfur Defects toward Superior Ethanol Electrosynthesis from CO2 Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To concurrently improve the yield of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol and catalyst stability, electro&#8208;driven intercalation is employed to form Cu&#8208;In dual&#8208;active sites with sulfur vacancies for the simultaneous adsorption of *H and *CO intermediates. This catalyst facilitates the rate&#8208;limiting step of *CHO formation for the key *OCHCHO* intermediate of ethanol production, delivering a stable and high rate of ethanol formation from CO2 electrolysis.








Abstract
The electrosynthesis of multi&#8208;carbon chemicals from excess carbon dioxide (CO2) is an area of great interest for research and commercial applications. However, improving both the yield of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol conversion and the stability of the catalyst at the same time is proving to be a challenging issue. Here it is proposed to stabilize active Cu(I) and In dual sites with sulfur defects through an electro&#8208;driven intercalation strategy, which leads to the delocalization of electron density that enhances orbital hybridizations between the Cu&#8208;C and In&#8208;H bonds. Hence, the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;limiting *CHO formation step is reduced toward the key *OCHCHO* formation during ethanol production, which is also facilitated by the combined Cu site enabling C&#8208;C coupling and In site with a higher oxygen affinity based on both thermodynamic and kinetic calculations. Accordingly, such dual&#8208;site catalyst achieves a high partial current density toward ethanol of 409 &#177; 15&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8315;2 for over 120 h. Furthermore, a scaled&#8208;up flow cell is assembled with an industrial&#8208;relevant current of 5.7 A for over 36 h, in which the carbon loss is less than 2.5% and single&#8208;pass carbon efficiency is &#8776;19%.

         <title>Toward Thin&#8208;Film Laser Diodes with Metal Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Perspective discusses fundamental material limitations and device integration challenges that need to be addressed to bring metal halide perovskite thin&#8208;film devices from lasing under optical pumping to electrical pumping. These aspects include optical gain mechanisms, carrier recombination dynamics, electroluminescence efficiency roll&#8208;off, thermal runaway, and low&#8208;optical&#8208;loss layouts with compatible resonant cavity integration methods.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskite semiconductors hold a strong promise for enabling thin&#8208;film laser diodes. Perovskites distinguish themselves from other non&#8208;epitaxial media primarily through their ability to maintain performance at high current densities, which is a critical requirement for achieving injection lasing. Coming in a wide range of varieties, numerous perovskites delivered low&#8208;threshold optical amplified spontaneous emission and optically pumped lasing when combined with a suitable optical cavity. A progression toward electrically pumped lasing requires the development of efficient light&#8208;emitting structures with reduced optical losses and high radiative efficiency at lasing&#8208;level current densities. This involves a set of important trade&#8208;offs in terms of material choice, stack and waveguide design, as well as resonator integration. In this Perspective, the key milestones are highlighted that have been achieved in the study of passive optical waveguides and light&#8208;emitting diodes, and these learnings are translated toward more complex laser diode architectures. Finally, a novel resonator integration route is proposed that is capable of relaxing optical and electrical design constraints.

         <title>Atto&#8208;Scale Noise Near&#8208;Infrared Organic Photodetectors Enabled by Controlling Interfacial Energetic Offset through Enhanced Anchoring Ability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study examines the JD and noise equiv. power (NEP) in NIR OPDs with varying electron blocking layers (EBLs). A newly synthesized EBL (named 3PAFBr) is introduced via a JD generation mechanism, significantly impacting NEP. The 3PAFBr&#8208;based OPD demonstrates a noise current of 852 aA (JD = 12.3 fA&#160;cm&#8315;2 at V &#8594; &#8722;0.1 V) and achieves several femtowatt&#8208;scale NEPs.








Abstract
The near&#8208;infrared (NIR) sensor technology is crucial for various applications such as autonomous driving and biometric tracking. Silicon photodetectors (SiPDs) are widely used in NIR applications; however, their scalability is limited by their crystalline properties. Organic photodetectors (OPDs) have attracted attention for NIR applications owing to their scalability, low&#8208;temperature processing, and notably low dark current density (JD), which is similar to that of SiPDs. However, the still high JD (at NIR band) and few measurements of noise equivalent powers (NEPs) pose challenges for accurate performance comparisons. This study addresses these issues by quantitatively characterizing the performance matrix and JD generation mechanism using electron&#8208;blocking layers (EBLs) in OPDs. The energy offset at an EBL/photosensitive layer interface determines the thermal activation energy and directly affects JD. A newly synthesized EBL (3PAFBr) substantially enhances the interfacial energy barrier by forming a homogeneous contact owing to the improved anchoring ability of 3PAFBr. As a result, the OPD with 3PAFBr yields a noise current of 852 aA (JD = 12.3 fA&#160;cm&#8315;2 at V &#8594; &#8722;0.1&#160;V) and several femtowatt&#8208;scale NEPs. As far as it is known, this is an ultralow of&#160;JD in NIR OPDs. This emphasizes the necessity for quantitative performance characterization.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By Ni substitution in the tetrahedral sites of Co&#8208;based thiospinel, Co atoms are activated to construct catalytic domain with multiple active sites. Resultant adsorption configuration leads to enhanced interaction between Li2CO3 and NiCo2S4, which result in reduced energy barrier for Li2CO3 decomposition and excellent catalytic activity to CO2 evolution reaction. As a result, the charge voltage is significantly reduced.








Abstract
Catalytic reactions mainly depend on the adsorption properties of reactants on the catalyst, which provides a perspective for the design of reversible lithium&#8722;carbon dioxide (Li&#8722;CO2) batteries including CO2 reduction (CO2RR) and CO2 evolution (CO2ER) reactions. However, due to the complex reaction process, the relationship between the adsorption configuration and CO2RR/CO2ER catalytic activity is still unclear in Li&#9472;CO2 batteries. Herein, taking Co3S4 as a model system, nickel (Ni&#160;substitution in the tetrahedral site to activate cobalt (Co) atom for forming multiatom catalytic domains in NiCo2S4 is utilized. Benefiting from the special geometric and electronic structures, NiCo2S4 exhibits an optimized adsorption configuration of lithium carbonate (Li2CO3), promoting its effective activation and decomposition. As a result, the Li&#8722;CO2 batteries with NiCo2S4 cathode exhibit remarkable electrochemical performance in terms of low potential gap of 0.42&#160;V and high energy efficiency of 88.7%. This work provides a unique perspective for the development of highly efficient catalysts in Li&#8722;CO2 batteries.

         <title>Inhibited Passivation by Bioinspired Cell Membrane Zn Interface for Zn&#8211;Air Batteries with Extended Temperature Adaptability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bioinspired cell membrane Zn|electrolyte interface inhibits the growth rate of the passivation layer on the Zn surface of Zn&#8211;air batteries, thereby increasing the charge transfer dynamics at the Zn interface. The robust cycling stability of corresponding bioinspired Zn&#8211;air batteries from 25 to &#8722;60&#160;&#176;C is achieved, which is almost three times that of unmodified Zn&#8211;air batteries.








Abstract
Due to the slow dynamics of mass and charge transfer at Zn|electrolyte interface, the stable operation of Zn&#8211;air batteries (ZABs) is challenging, especially at low temperature. Herein, inspired by cell membrane, a hydrophilic&#8208;hydrophobic dual modulated Zn|electrolyte interface is constructed. This amphiphilic design enables the quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state (QSS) ZABs to display a long&#8208;term cyclability of 180 h@50&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 25&#160;&#176;C. Moreover, a record&#8208;long time of 173 h@4&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;60&#160;&#176;C is also achieved, which is almost threefolds of untreated QSS ZABs. Control experiments and (in situ) characterization reveal that the growth of insulating ZnO passivation layers is largely inhibited by tuned hydrophilic&#8211;hydrophobic behavior. Thus, the enhanced transfer dynamic of Zn2+ at Zn|electrolyte interface from 25 to &#8722;60&#160;&#176;C is attained. As an extension, the QSS Al&#8208;air batteries (AABs) with bioinspired interface also show unprecedented discharge stability of 420 h@1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at &#8208;40&#160;&#176;C, which is about two times of untreated QSS AABs. This bioinspired&#8208;hydrophilic&#8208;hydrophobic dual modulation strategy may provide a reference for energy transform and storage devices with broad temperature adaptability.

Surface Amorphization
In article number 2404103, WooChul Jung, Bong&#8208;Joong Kim, Jongsu Seo, Scott A. Barnett, and their research team successfully induced simultaneous surface amorphization and nanocatalyst ex&#8208;solution on perovskite oxides through a simple hydrogen heat treatment. This surface reconstruction leads to a highly reactive and stable solid oxide fuel cell cathode, demonstrating its potential applicability to a full cell system. The cover image illustrates this surface reconstruction process, showing how hydrogen gas creates an amorphous surface and facilitates nanocatalyst ex&#8208;solution.

Hemostatic Peptide Hydrogel
The immemorial Chinese fairy tale &#8220;Nuwa fixing the sky&#8221; is used to metaphor the hemostatic process of hemostatic peptide hydrogel (HPH) in article number 2405290 by Chaoqiang Fan, Malcolm Xing, Shiming Yang, and co&#8208;workers. The hole in the sky and the pouring flood from Tianhe River are metaphors for the wound and severe hemorrhage. The goddess Nuwa is using colorful stones which represent HPH, triggered by the blue laser to halt bleeding and saving lives.

Spontaneous Separation for Air&#8208;Floating Graphene Macrofilms
By means of ethanol&#8208;based binary solution, the self&#8208;assembly performance of graphene oxide is enhanced dramatically at air&#8208;liquid interface, and the formed graphene oxide film first separates spontaneously from the solution to obtain an ultrathin air&#8208;floating graphene macrofilm (AGF). The in situ growth sensors based on AGFs are fabricated and show quick response and ultrahigh sensitivity for temperature and slight disturbance. More details can be found in article number 2408550 by Guomin Ding, Bowen Yang, Qilin Mei, and co&#8208;workers.

Porous Carbon Scaffolds
A dodecahedral activated N&#8208;doped porous carbon scaffold is synthesized and used for the nanoconfinement of Mg(BH4)2. Precise activation control enables a transformation from microporous carbon materials to mesoporous ones with extremely high specific surface area and pore volume, and hence the efficient nanoconfinement of Mg(BH4)2, realization of one&#8208;step dehydrogenation and superior reversibility. More details can be found in article number 2406152 by Lixian Sun, Lixin Chen, Xuezhang Xiao, and co&#8208;workers.

         <title>Delivery Systems Developed for Treatment Combinations to Improve Adoptive Cell Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive overview of various delivery strategies for combination cell therapy and their application in the clinic. Furthermore, the remaining challenges and opportunities in this emerging field are disscussed in detial, with the hope of accelerating the clinical translation of adoptive cell therapy for solid tumour.








Abstract
Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) has shown great success in the clinic for treating hematologic malignancies. However, solid tumor treatment with ACT monotherapy is still challenging, owing to insufficient expansion and rapid exhaustion of adoptive cells, tumor antigen downregulation/loss, and dense tumor extracellular matrix. Delivery strategies for combination cell therapy have great potential to overcome these hurdles. The delivery of vaccines, immune checkpoint inhibitors, cytokines, chemotherapeutics, and photothermal reagents in combination with adoptive cells, have been shown to improve the expansion/activation, decrease exhaustion, and promote the penetration of adoptive cells in solid tumors. Moreover, the delivery of nucleic acids to engineer immune cells directly in vivo holds promise to overcome many of the hurdles associated with the complex ex vivo cell engineering strategies. Here, these research advance, as well as the opportunities and challenges for integrating delivery technologies into cell therapy s are discussed, and the outlook for these emerging areas are criticlly analyzed.

This review offers a comprehensive overview of the development of new materials and strategies aimed at enhancing N2 activation and NH3 formation in thermal catalysis. It highlights recent mechanisms, including self&#8208;electron donation, hydride fixation, promotion of anionic vacancies, and hydridic hydrogen reduction. Furthermore, the review discusses future challenges and opportunities for achieving sustainable ammonia synthesis.








Abstract
Ammonia (NH3) is one of the most important precursors of various chemicals and fertilizers. Given that ammonia synthesis via the traditional Haber&#8211;Bosch process requires high temperatures and pressures, it is critical to explore effective strategies and catalysts for ammonia synthesis under mild reaction conditions. Although electrocatalysis and photocatalysis can convert N2 to NH3 under mild conditions, their efficiencies and production scales are still far from the requirements for industrialization. Thermal catalysis has been proven to be the most direct and effective approach for ammonia synthesis. Over the past few decades, significant efforts have been made to develop novel catalysts capable of nitrogen fixation and ammonia generation via thermal catalytic processes. In parallel with catalyst exploration, new strategies such as self&#8208;electron donation, hydride fixation, hydridic hydrogen reduction, and anionic vacancy promotion have also been explored to moderate the operating conditions and improve the catalytic efficiency of ammonia synthesis. In this review, the emergence of new materials and strategies for promoting N2 activation and NH3 formation during thermal catalysis is briefly summarized. Moreover, challenges and prospects are proposed for the future development of thermal catalytic ammonia synthesis.

         <title>Nanoengineering&#8208;Enhanced Capillary Cooling Achieves Sustained Thermal Protection for Ultra&#8208;High Heat Flux and Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Extreme thermal conditions with heat flux densities exceeding 1 MW&#183;m&#8722;2 or temperatures reaching up to 1000 &#176;C are prevalent in various situations. However, the ability of thermal protection either depends on specialized materials or is currently limited with existing cooling schemes. Herein, we propose an innovative cooling scheme that relies on evaporation&#8208;driven capillary flow enhanced by nanoengineering&#8208;designed porous structures with common materials. Experimentally&#8208;obtained capillary flow cooling curve identifies critical heat flux corresponding to evaporation&#8208;driven flow stage, where coolants cool the surface and subsequent vapor impedes heat transfer from thermal boundaries. Nanoengineering provides opportunities for enhanced capillary flow, which proves to endow bronze, TC4, and Al2O3 with thermal protection ability 50%&#8722;180% higher than that without nanoengineering&#8208;designed. Our scheme achieves critical heat flux up to 2.0&#8208;3.1 MW&#183;m&#8722;2, and performs thermal dissipation capacity almost twice higher than inherent latent heat of coolant. Furthermore, in a supersonic wind tunnel with total temperature reaching up to 1792 K, our scheme effectively protects surfaces by cooling them to surface temperatures below 500 K. Nanoengineering&#8208;enhanced capillary cooling gives access to the application of common materials for high&#8208;temperature and high&#8208;heat&#8208;flux environments and paves the way for the development of lightweight, long&#8208;lasting, and large&#8208;scale solutions for thermal protection.

Abstract
Inspired by intriguing color changeable ability of natural animals, the design and fabrication of artificial mechanochromic materials capable of changing colors upon stretching or pressing have attracted intense scientific interest. Liquid crystal (LC) is a self&#8208;organized soft matter with anisotropic molecular alignment. Due to the sensitivity to various external stimulations, LC has been considered as an emerging and appealing responsive building block to construct intelligent materials and advanced devices. Recently, mechanochromic LC materials have becoming a hot topic in multi fields from flexible artificial skins to visualized sensors and smart biomimetic devices. In this review, the recent progress of mechanochromic LCs is comprehensively summarized. Firstly, the mechanism and functionalities of mechanochromic LC is introduced, followed by preparation of various functional materials based on mechanochromic LCs. Then the applications of mechanochromic LCs are provided. Finally, the conclusion and outlooks of this field is given. This overview is hoped to provide inspiration in fabrication of advanced functional soft materials for scientists and engineers from multidisciplines including materials science, elastomers, chemistry and physical science.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Mediated DNA Nanotechnology in 3D: Structural Library by Templated Diffraction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
DNA double helices containing metal&#8208;mediated DNA (mmDNA) base pairs have been constructed from Ag+ and Hg2+ ions between pyrimidine:pyrimidine pairs with the promise of nanoelectronics. Rational design of mmDNA nanomaterials has been impractical without a complete lexical and structural description. Here, we explore the programmability of structural DNA nanotechnology toward its founding mission of self&#8208;assembling a diffraction platform for biomolecular structure determination. We employed the tensegrity triangle to build a comprehensive structural library of mmDNA pairs via X&#8208;ray diffraction and elucidated generalized design rules for mmDNA construction. We uncovered two binding modes: N3&#8208;dominant, centrosymmetric pairs and major groove binders driven by 5&#8208;position ring modifications. Energy gap calculations showed additional levels in the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) of mmDNA structures, rendering them attractive molecular electronic candidates.
