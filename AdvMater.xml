         <title>Harvesting Energy from Atmospheric Water: Grand Challenges in Continuous Electricity Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Atmospheric water is ubiquitous on Earth and extensively participates in the natural water cycle through evaporation and condensation. This process involves tremendous energy exchange with the environment, but very little of the energy has so far been harnessed. The recently emerged hydrovoltaic technology, especially moisture&#8208;induced electricity, has shown great potential in harvesting energy from atmospheric water and gives birth to moisture energy harvesting devices. The device performance, especially the long&#8208;term operational capacity, has been significantly enhanced over the past few years. Further development, however, requires in&#8208;depth understanding of mechanisms, innovative materials, and ingenious system designs. In this review, beginning with describing the basic properties of water, we discuss the key aspects of the water&#8208;hygroscopic material interactions and mechanisms of power generation. We then summarize the current material systems and advances in promising material development. Aiming at the chief bottlenecks of limited operational time, we list advanced system designs that are helpful to improve device performance. Especially, the synergistic effect of moisture adsorption and water evaporation on material and system levels to accomplish sustained electricity generation is discussed. Finally, we analyze the remaining challenges and suggest future directions for developing this promising technology.

         <title>Chiral MoSe2 Nanoparticles for Ultrasensitive Monitoring of Reactive Oxygen Species In Vivo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral molybdenum diselenide nanoparticles modified by the fluorescent molecule (cyanine 3) are synthesized. They are used as nanoprobes for reactive oxygen species (ROS) detection through changes in chiral and fluorescent signals due to Mo4+ and Se2&#8722; oxidation reaction induced by ROS on the surface of nanoparticles. These signals can indicate the ROS levels in living cells and in vivo.








Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, and acute hepatitis, and quantification of ROS is critical for the early diagnosis of these diseases. In this work, a novel probe is developed,&#160;based on chiral molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2) nanoparticles (NPs) modified by the fluorescent molecule, cyanine 3 (Cy3). Chiral MoSe2 NPs show intensive circular dichroism (CD) signals at 390 and 550&#160;nm, whereas the fluorescence of Cy3 at 560&#160;nm is quenched by MoSe2 NPs. In the presence of ROS, the probe reacts with the ROS and then oxidates rapidly, resulting in decreased CD signals and the recovery of the fluorescence. Using this strategy, the limit of detection values of CD and fluorescent signals in living cells are 0.0093&#160;nmol/106 cells and 0.024&#160;nmol/106 cells, respectively. The high selectivity and sensitivity to ROS in complex biological environments is attributed to the Mo4+ and Se2&#8722; oxidation reactions on the surface of the NPs. Furthermore, chiral MoSe2 NPs are able to monitor the levels of ROS in vivo by the fluorescence. Collectively, this strategy offers a new approach for ROS detection and has the potential to inspire others to explore chiral nanomaterials as biosensors to investigate biological events.

         <title>Microenvironmentally Responsive Chemotherapeutic Prodrugs and CHEK2 Inhibitors Self&#8208;Assembled Micelles: Protecting Fertility and Enhancing Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A co&#8208;delivery micelle (BML@PMP) that consists of a reduction&#8208;sensitive paclitaxel prodrug (PMP) for chemotherapy and a CHEK2 inhibitor (BML277) is developed for both fertility protection and chemotherapy enhancement. The BML@PMP micelles enhance the antitumor effect by delivering a high dose of paclitaxel to the tumor and inhibiting DNA damage repair, and prevent fertility damage by inhibiting the CHEK2&#8208;TAp63&#945; pathway in the ovary.








Abstract
Chemotherapy is a widely used and effective adjuvant treatment for cancer, and it has unavoidable damage to female fertility, with statistics showing 38% of women who have received chemotherapy are infertile. How to reduce fertility toxicity while enhancing the oncologic chemotherapy is a clinical challenge. Herein, co&#8208;delivery micelles (BML@PMP) are developed, which are composed of a reduction&#8208;sensitive paclitaxel prodrug (PMP) for chemotherapy and a CHEK2 inhibitor (BML277) for both fertility protection and chemotherapy enhancement. BML@PMP achieves fertility protection through three actions: (1) Due to the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, BML@PMP is more enriched in the tumor, while very little in the ovary (about 1/10th of the tumor). (2) Glutathione (GSH) triggers the release of PTX, and with low levels of GSH in the ovary, the amount of PTX released in the ovary is correspondingly reduced. (3) BML277 inhibits oocyte apoptosis by inhibiting the CHEK2&#8208;TAp63&#945; pathway. Because of the different downstream targets of CHEK2 in tumor cells and oocytes, BML277 also enhances chemotherapeutic efficacy by reducing DNA damage repair which is activated through the CHEK2 pathway. This bidirectional effect of CHEK2 inhibitor&#8208;based co&#8208;delivery system represents a promising strategy for improving oncology treatment indices and preventing chemotherapy&#8208;associated fertility damage.

         <title>Toward Electrocatalytic Methanol Oxidation Reaction: Longstanding Debates and Emerging Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The study on direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) has lasted around 70 years since its first investigation in the early 1950s. Though enormous effort has been devoted in this field, it is still far from commercialization. The methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) as a semi&#8208;reaction of DMFCs is the bottleneck reaction that restricts the overall performance of DMFCs. To date, there are intense debates on the complex 6&#8208;electron reaction, but barely any reviews have systematically discussed this topic. To this end, we summarized the controversies and progress regarding the electrocatalytic mechanisms, performance evaluations as well as the design science toward MOR electrocatalysts. This review also provides a comprehensive introduction on the recent development of emerging MOR electrocatalysts with a focus on the innovation of the alloy, core&#8208;shell structure, heterostructure and single&#8208;atom catalysts. Finally, perspectives on the future outlook toward the mechanisms study and electrocatalysts design are provided.

         <title>Ceria Nanoparticles as Copper Chaperones that Activate SOD1 for Synergistic Antioxidant Therapy to Treat Ischemic Vascular Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
All exogenous nanomaterials undergo rapid biotransformation once injected into body and fall short of executing the intended purpose. Here we report that copper&#8208;deposited ceria nanoparticles (CuCe NPs) exhibit enhanced antioxidant effects than pristine ceria nanoparticles as the released copper buffers the depletion of glutathione while providing the bioavailable copper as a cofactor for the antioxidant enzyme, superoxide dismutase 1. The upregulated intracellular antioxidants along with ceria nanoparticles synergistically scavenge reactive oxygen species and promote anti&#8208;inflammation and M2 polarization of macrophages by modulating STAT1 and STAT6. The therapeutic effect of CuCe NPs is demonstrated in ischemic vascular diseases (i.e., murine models of hindlimb ischemia and myocardial infarction) in which the copper&#8208;deposition affords increased perfusion and alleviation in tissue damages. The results provide rationale that metal oxide nanomaterials can be designed in a way to induce the upregulation of specific biological factors for optimal therapeutic performance.

Abstract
Lithium metal is a promising anode for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium batteries, but its practical application is still hindered by intrinsic defects such as infinite volume expansion and uncontrollable dendrites growth. Herein, a dendrite&#8208;free 3D composite Li anode (Li&#8208;B@SSM) is prepared by mechanically rolling of lithiophilic LiB nanofibers supported Li&#8208;B composite and lithiophobic stainless&#8208;steel mesh (SSM). Featuring hierarchical lithiophilic&#8208;lithiophobic dual&#8208;skeletons, the Li&#8208;B@SSM anode shows an ultra&#8208;high Coulombic efficiency of 99.95% and a long lifespan of 900 h under 2 mA cm&#8722;2/1 mAh cm&#8722;2. It is demonstrated that the abnormally reversible Li stripping/plating processes should be closely related to the site&#8208;selective plating behavior and spatial confinement effect induced by the robust lithiophilic&#8208;lithiophobic dual&#8208;skeletons, which alleviates the volume changes, suppresses the growth of Li dendrites, and reduces the accumulation of &#8220;dead&#8221; Li. More importantly, the application feasibility of the Li&#8208;B@SSM anode is also confirmed in full batteries, of which the Li&#8208;B@SSM|LiFePO4 full cell shows a high capacity retention of 97.5% after 400 cycles while the Li&#8208;B@SSM|S pouch battery exhibits good cycle stability even under practically harsh conditions. This work paves the way for the facile and efficient fabrication of high&#8208;efficiency Li metal anode toward practical applications.

         <title>Multiplexed Ultrasensitive Sample&#8208;to&#8208;Answer RT&#8208;LAMP Chip for the Identification of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and Influenza Viruses</title>

         <dc:description>
An ultrasensitive sample&#8208;to&#8208;answer chip operated by LED is developed to detect SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and influenza viruses simultaneously. The ultrafast target enrichment (&#8776;500&#215;) followed by autonomous elution and amplification via photothermal activation enables limit&#8208;of&#8208;detection of 0.5 copies &#181;L&#8722;1. The sensitive detection in point&#8208;of&#8208;care settings comparable to standard polymerase chain reaction allows timely management of various pandemic situations that may be faced shortly.








Abstract
Prompt on&#8208;site diagnosis of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 with other respiratory infections will have minimized the global impact of the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic through rapid, effective management. However, no such multiplex point&#8208;of&#8208;care (POC) chip has satisfied a suitable sensitivity of gold&#8208;standard nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs). Here, a rapid multiplexed ultrasensitive sample&#8208;to&#8208;answer loop&#8208;mediated isothermal amplification (MUSAL) chip operated by simple LED&#8208;driven photothermal amplification to detect six targets from single&#8208;swab sampling is presented. First, the MUSAL chip allows ultrafast on&#8208;chip sample preparation with &#8776;500&#8208;fold preconcentration at a rate of 1.2&#160;mL min&#8722;1. Second, the chip enables contamination&#8208;free amplification using autonomous target elution into on&#8208;chip reagents by photothermal activation. Finally, the chip accomplishes multiplexed on&#8208;chip diagnostics of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and influenza viruses with a limit of detection (LoD) of 0.5 copies &#181;L&#8722;1. The rapid, ultrasensitive, cost&#8208;effective sample&#8208;to&#8208;answer chip with a multiplex capability will allow timely management of various pandemics situations that may be faced shortly.

         <title>Correlated Rattling of Sodium&#8208;Chains Suppressing Thermal Conduction in Thermoelectric Stannides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tin&#8208;based intermetallics with tunnel frameworks encapsulating zigzag Na&#8208;chains show lower thermal conductivity with decreasing inter&#8208;Na distances. Na atoms behave as Einstein&#8208;like oscillators along the tunnel, while significant interactions exist both between Na atoms in the chain and between the chain and the framework. The large anisotropic oscillations, the correlation of Na atoms in the tunnels, and their interaction with frameworks&#160;lead to low thermal conductivity.








Abstract
Tin&#8208;based intermetallics with tunnel frameworks containing zigzag Na chains that excite correlated rattling impinging on the framework phonons are attractive as thermoelectric materials owing to their low lattice thermal conductivity. The correlated rattling of Na atoms in the zigzag chains and the origin of the low thermal conductivity is uncovered via experimental and computational analyses. The Na atoms behave as oscillators along the tunnel, resulting in substantial interactions between Na atoms in the chain and between the chain and framework. In these intermetallic compounds, a shorter inter&#8208;rattler distance results in lower thermal conductivity, suggesting that phonon scattering by the correlated rattling Na&#8208;chains is enhanced. These results provide new insights into the behavior of thermoelectric materials with low thermal conductivity and suggest strategies for the development of such materials that utilize the correlated rattling.

         <title>Direct CO2 Capture by Alkali&#8208;Dissolved Cellulose and Sequestration in Building Materials and Artificial Reef Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkali cellulose solutions are used as CO2 absorption media to lead mineralized cellulose materials at a tailorable cellulose&#8208;to&#8208;mineral ratio. Cellulose lean gels are converted into dry powders, shown as a functional component of ceramic glazes and cementitious composites; meanwhile, cellulose&#8208;rich gels are moldable and extrudable, yielding stone&#8208;like structures tested as artificial substrates for coral reef restoration.








Abstract
Current carbon capture and utilization (CCU) technologies require high energy input and costly catalysts. Here, an effective pathway is offered that addresses climate action by atmospheric CO2 sequestration. Industrially relevant highly reactive alkali cellulose solutions are used as CO2 absorption media. The latter lead to mineralized cellulose materials (MCM) at a tailorable cellulose&#8208;to&#8208;mineral ratio, forming organic&#8208;inorganic viscous systems (viscosity from 102 to 107&#160;mPa&#160;s and storage modulus from 10 to 105&#160;Pa). CO2 absorption and conversion into calcium carbonate and associated minerals translate to maximum absorption of 6.5&#160;gCO2 gcellulose&#8722;1, tracking inversely with cellulose loading. Cellulose lean gels are easily converted into dry powders, shown as a functional component of ceramic glazes and cementitious composites. Meanwhile, cellulose&#8208;rich gels are moldable and extrudable, yielding stone&#8208;like structures tested as artificial substrates for coral reef restoration. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) suggests new CCU opportunities for building materials, as demonstrated in underwater deployment for coral reef ecosystem restoration.

         <title>Controlled Distributed Ti3C2Tx Hollow Microspheres on Thermally Conductive Polyimide Composite Films for Excellent Electromagnetic Interference Shielding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Flexible multifunctional polymer&#8208;based electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding composite films have important applications in the fields of 5G communication technology, wearable electronic devices, and artificial intelligence. Based on the design of a porous/multilayered structure, and using polyimide (PI) as the matrix and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) microspheres as the template, flexible (Fe3O4/PI)&#8211;Ti3C2Tx&#8211;(Fe3O4/PI) composite films with controllable pore sizes and distribution of Ti3C2Tx hollow microspheres are successfully prepared by sacrificial template method. Owing to the porous/multilayered structure, when the pore size of the Ti3C2Tx hollow microspheres is 10&#160;&#956;m and the mass ratio of PMMA/Ti3C2Tx is 2:1, the (Fe3O4/PI)&#8211;Ti3C2Tx&#8211;(Fe3O4/PI) composite film has the most excellent EMI shielding performance, with EMI shielding effectiveness (EMI SE) of 85&#160;dB. It is further verified by finite element simulation that the composite film has an excellent shielding effect on electromagnetic waves. In addition, the composite film has good thermal conductivity (thermal conductivity coefficient of 3.49&#160;W/(m&#183;K)) and mechanical properties (tensile strength of 65.3&#160;MPa). This flexible (Fe3O4/PI)&#8211;Ti3C2Tx&#8211;(Fe3O4/PI) composite film with excellent EMI shielding performance, thermal conductivity, and mechanical properties has demonstrated great potential for applications in EMI shielding protection for high&#8208;power, portable, and wearable flexible electronic devices.

This flexible (Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/PI)&#8211;Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&#8211;(Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/PI) composite film with excellent EMI shielding performance, thermal conductivity, and mechanical properties has demonstrated great potential for applications in EMI shielding protection for high-power, portable, and wearable flexible electronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;

Charged interfaces are a central functional domain for advanced energy materials and biomacromolecules. Predictive simulations play a pivotal role in understanding molecular mechanisms, optimizing performance metrics, and providing rational design strategies for novel advanced materials.








Abstract
Electrostatic interactions play a dominant role in charged materials systems. Understanding the complex correlation between macroscopic properties with microscopic structures is of critical importance to develop rational design strategies for advanced materials. But the complexity of this challenging task is augmented by interfaces present in the charged materials systems, such as electrode&#8211;electrolyte interfaces or biological membranes. Over the last decades, predictive molecular simulations that are founded in fundamental physics and optimized for charged interfacial systems have proven their value in providing molecular understanding of physicochemical properties and functional mechanisms for diverse materials. Novel design strategies utilizing predictive models have been suggested as promising route for the rational design of materials with tailored properties. Here, an overview of recent advances in the understanding of charged interfacial systems aided by predictive molecular simulations is presented. Focusing on three types of charged interfaces found in energy materials and biomacromolecules, how the molecular models characterize ion structure, charge transport, morphology relation to the environment, and the thermodynamics/kinetics of molecular binding at the interfaces is discussed. The critical analysis brings two prominent field of energy materials and biological science under common perspective, to stimulate crossover in both research field that have been largely&#160;separated.

         <title>Transfer&#8208;Tattoo&#8208;Like Cell&#8208;Sheet Delivery Induced by Interfacial Cell Migration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 4, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of a transfer&#8208;tattoo&#8208;like cell&#8208;sheet delivery platform is described, based on interfacial cell migration. The use of a commercially available flexible parylene film facilitates the manipulation of cell sheets and the creation of freeform designs. The efficacy of a multilayered cell&#8208;sheet skin substitute in promoting re&#8208;epithelialization and re&#8208;vascularization of wounds in mouse models is demonstrated.








Abstract
A direct transfer of a cell sheet from a culture surface to a target tissue is introduced. Commercially available, flexible parylene is used as the culture surface, and it is proposed that the UV&#8208;treated parylene offers adequate and intermediate levels of cell adhesiveness for both the stable cell attachment during culture and for the efficient cell transfer to a target surface. The versatility of this cell&#8208;transfer process is demonstrated with various cell types, including MRC&#8208;5, HDFn, HULEC&#8208;5a, MC3T3&#8208;E1, A549, C2C12 cells, and MDCK&#8208;II cells. The novel cell&#8208;sheet engineering is based on a mechanism of interfacial cell migration between two surfaces with different adhesion preferences. Monitoring of cytoskeletal dynamics and drug treatments during the cell&#8208;transfer process reveals that the interfacial cell migration occurs by utilizing the existing transmembrane proteins on the cell surface to bind to the targeted surface. The re&#8208;establishment and reversal of cell polarity after the transfer process are also identified. Its unique capabilities of 3D multilayer stacking, freeform design, and curved surface application are demonstrated. Finally, the therapeutic potential of the cell&#8208;sheet delivery system is demonstrated by applying it to cutaneous wound healing and skin&#8208;tissue regeneration in mice models.

         <title>How to Change the Reaction Chemistry on Nonprecious Metal Oxide Nanostructure Materials for Electrocatalytic Oxidation of Biomass&#8208;Derived Glycerol to Renewable Chemicals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 4, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction kinetics and chemistry for the electrocatalytic glycerol oxidation reaction are investigated. Both experimental and computational methods are used to understand and reveal how and why the reaction kinetics and chemistry change with the electrochemically synthesized CuCo&#8208;oxide, Cu&#8208;oxide, and Co&#8208;oxide catalysts compared to conventional Au and Pt catalysts.








Abstract
Au and Pt are well&#8208;known catalysts for electrocatalytic oxidation of biomass&#8208;derived glycerol. Although some nonprecious&#8208;metal&#8208;based materials to replace the costly Au and Pt are used for this reaction, the fundamental question of how the nonprecious catalysts affect the reaction chemistry and mechanism compared to Au and Pt catalysts is still unanswered. In this work, both experimental and computational methods are used to understand how and why the reaction performance and chemistry for the electrocatalytic glycerol oxidation reaction (EGOR) change with electrochemically&#8208;synthesized CuCo&#8208;oxide, Cu&#8208;oxide, and Co&#8208;oxide catalysts compared to conventional Au and Pt catalysts. The Au and Pt catalysts generate major glyceric acid and glycolic acid products from the EGOR. Interestingly, the prepared Cu&#8208;based oxides produce glycolic acid and formic acid with high selectivity of about 90.0%. This different reaction chemistry is related to the enhanced ability of C&#63743;C bond cleavage on the Cu&#8208;based oxide materials. The density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the formic acids are mainly formed on the Cu&#8208;based oxide surfaces rather than in the process of glycolic acid formation in the free energy diagram. This study provides critical scientific insights into developing future nonprecious&#8208;based materials for electrochemical biomass conversions.

         <title>Atomically Thin Synapse Networks on Van Der Waals Photo&#8208;Memtransistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 4, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of an atomistic synaptic network on an atomically thin van der Waals heterostructure, where the ultrasmall cells built with trilayer tungsten disulfide (WS2) semiconductor serve as a gate&#8208;tunable photoactive synapse, is demonstrated. UV pulses onto the memristor generate dopants at atomic&#8208;level precision by direct light&#8211;lattice interactions, leading to the accurate modulation of the synaptic cells.








Abstract
A new type of atomically thin synaptic network on van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures is reported, where each ultrasmall cell (&#8776;2&#160;nm thick) built with trilayer WS2 semiconductor acts as a gate&#8208;tunable photoactive synapse, i.e., a photo&#8208;memtransistor. A train of UV pulses onto the WS2 memristor generates dopants in atomic&#8208;level precision by direct light&#8211;lattice interactions, which, along with the gate tunability, leads to the accurate modulation of the channel conductance for potentiation and depression of the synaptic cells. Such synaptic dynamics can be explained by a parallel atomistic resistor network model. In addition, it is shown that such a device scheme can generally be realized in other 2D vdW semiconductors, such as MoS2, MoSe2, MoTe2, and WSe2. Demonstration of these atomically thin photo&#8208;memtransistor arrays, where the synaptic weights can be tuned for the atomistic defect density, provides implications for a new type of artificial neural networks for parallel matrix computations with an ultrahigh integration density.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 4, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly active Ru catalyst with abundant active sites for ammonia dehydrogenation, which is essential for utilizing ammonia as a hydrogen carrier, is prepared by a novel synthesis method. A highly active Ru catalyst with a unique atomic structure is designed to induce the formation of hexagonal planar&#8208;shaped Ru nanoparticles with abundant B5 sites by utilizing 2D hexagonal boron nitride as a template support.








Abstract
Ruthenium is one of the most active catalysts for ammonia dehydrogenation and is essential for the use of ammonia as a hydrogen storage material. The B5&#8208;type site on the surface of ruthenium is expected to exhibit the highest catalytic activity for ammonia dehydrogenation, but the number of these sites is typically low. Here, a B5&#8208;site&#8208;rich ruthenium catalyst is synthesized by exploiting the crystal symmetry of a hexagonal boron nitride support. In the prepared ruthenium catalyst, ruthenium nanoparticles are formed epitaxially on hexagonal boron nitride sheets with hexagonal planar morphologies, in which the B5 sites predominate along the nanoparticle edges. By activating the catalyst under the reaction condition, the population of B5 sites further increases as the facets of the ruthenium nanoparticles develop. The electron density of the Ru nanoparticles also increases during catalyst activation. The synthesized catalyst shows superior catalytic activity for ammonia dehydrogenation compared to previously reported catalysts. This work demonstrates that morphology control of a catalyst via support&#8208;driven heteroepitaxy can be exploited for synthesizing highly active heterogeneous catalysts with tailored atomic structures.

&lt;p&gt;A highly active Ru catalyst with abundant active sites for ammonia dehydrogenation, which is essential for utilizing ammonia as a hydrogen carrier, is prepared by a novel synthesis method. A highly active Ru catalyst with a unique atomic structure is designed to induce the formation of hexagonal planar-shaped Ru nanoparticles with abundant B&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; sites by utilizing 2D hexagonal boron nitride as a template support.

         <title>Electroconductive, Adhesive, Non&#8208;Swelling, and Viscoelastic Hydrogels for Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 4, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new conductive hydrogel is developed through the simultaneous exfoliation of graphite and polymerization of zwitterionic monomers triggered by microwave irradiation. This hydrogel demonstrates tissue&#8208;like extraneuronal electrodes satisfying requirements of bioelectronics such as low storage modulus, high viscoelasticity, low toxicity, reliable adhesion, and conformability to biological tissues, and maintenance of conductivity and hydrogel volume in wet environments.








Abstract
As a new class of materials, implantable flexible electrical conductors have recently been developed and applied to bioelectronics. An ideal electrical conductor requires high conductivity, tissue&#8208;like mechanical properties, low toxicity, reliable adhesion to biological tissues, and the ability to maintain its shape in wet physiological environments. Despite significant advances, electrical conductors that satisfy all these requirements are insufficient. Herein, a facile method for manufacturing a new conductive hydrogels through the simultaneous exfoliation of graphite and polymerization of zwitterionic monomers triggered by microwave irradiation is introduced. The mechanical properties of the obtained conductive hydrogel are similar to those of living tissue, which is ideal as a bionic adhesive for minimizing contact damage due to mechanical mismatches between hard electronics and soft tissues. Furthermore, it exhibits excellent adhesion performance, electrical conductivity, non&#8208;swelling, and high conformability in water. Excellent biocompatibility of the hydrogel is confirmed through a cytotoxicity test using C2C12 cells, a biocompatibility test on rat tissues, and their histological analysis. The hydrogel is then implanted into the sciatic nerve of a rat and neuromodulation is demonstrated through low&#8208;current electrical stimulation. This hydrogel demonstrates a tissue&#8208;like extraneuronal electrode, which possesses high conformability to improve the tissue&#8211;electronics interfaces, promising next&#8208;generation bioelectronics applications.

         <title>Superionic Bifunctional Polymer Electrolytes for Solid&#8208;State Energy Storage and Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 4, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superionic bifunctional polymer electrolytes, in which ion relaxation is decoupled from polymer relaxation, are developed to advance electromechanical and electrochemical technologies. Through the formation of intra&#8208;monomer hydrogen bonds between two functional groups, electrostatic interactions of the polymer matrix are effectively weakened to form interconnected rod&#8208;like ion channels in the glassy matrix, thereby accelerating proton transport with a low activation barrier.








Abstract
Achieving superionic conductivity from solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes is an important task in the development of future energy storage and conversion technologies. Herein, a platform for innovative electrolyte technologies based on a bifunctional polymer, poly(3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;4&#8208;sulfonated styrene) (PS&#8208;3H4S), is presented. By incorporating &#63743;OH and &#63743;SO3H functional groups at adjacent positions in the styrene repeating unit, &#8220;intra&#8208;monomer&#8221; hydrogen bonds are formed to effectively weaken the electrostatic interactions of the &#63743;SO3&#8722; moieties in the polymer matrix with embedded ions, promoting rich structural and dynamic heterogeneity in the PS&#8208;3H4S electrolyte. Upon the incorporation of an ionic liquid, interconnected rod&#8208;like ion channels, which allow the decoupling of ion relaxation from polymer relaxation, are formed in the stiff motif of the polymeric domains passivated by interfacial ionic layers. This results in accelerated proton hopping through the glassy polymer matrix, and proton hopping becomes more pronounced at cryogenic temperatures down to &#8722;35 &#176;C. The PS&#8208;3H4S/ionic liquid composite electrolytes exhibit a high ionic conductivity of 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 and high storage modulus of &#8776;100&#160;MPa at 25 &#176;C, and can be successfully applied in soft actuators and lithium&#8208;metal batteries.

         <title>Spatial Separation of Cocatalysts on Z&#8208;Scheme Organic/Inorganic Heterostructure Hollow Spheres for Enhanced Photocatalytic H2 Evolution and In&#8208;Depth Analysis of the Charge&#8208;Transfer Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 4, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction hollow sphere with spatially separated cocatalysts is proposed to overcome the fundamental limitation in photocatalytic water splitting. The Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction effectively stimulates interfacial charge transfer while retaining high redox power, whereas the spatially separated cocatalysts stimulate surface charge separation. Their synergistic effect results in an exceptional photocatalytic H2 evolution performance of 8.15 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1.








Abstract
A Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction with spatially separated cocatalysts is proposed for overcoming fundamental issues in photocatalytic water splitting, such as inefficient light absorption, charge recombination, and sluggish reaction kinetics. For efficient light absorption and interfacial charge separation, Z&#8208;scheme organic/inorganic heterojunction photocatalysts are synthesized by firmly immobilizing ultrathin g&#8208;C3N4 on the surface of TiO2 hollow spheres via electrostatic interactions. Additionally, two cocatalysts, Pt and IrOx, are spatially separated along the Z&#8208;scheme charge&#8208;transfer pathway to enhance surface charge separation and reaction kinetics. The as&#8208;prepared Pt/g&#8208;C3N4/TiO2/IrOx (PCTI) hollow sphere photocatalyst exhibits an exceptional H2 evolution rate of 8.15&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 and a remarkable apparent quantum yield of 24.3% at 330&#160;nm in the presence of 0.5 wt% Pt and 1.2 wt% IrOx cocatalysts on g&#8208;C3N4 and TiO2, respectively. Photoassisted Kelvin probe force microscopy is used to systematically analyze the Z&#8208;scheme charge&#8208;transfer mechanism within PCTI. Furthermore, the benefits of spatially separating cocatalysts in the PCTI system are methodically investigated in comparison to randomly depositing them. This work adequately demonstrates that the combination of a Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction and spatially separated cocatalysts can be a promising strategy for designing high&#8208;performance photocatalytic platforms for solar fuel production.

Photocatalytic H2 Evolution
In article number 2200172, Kijung Yong and co&#8208;workers present a Pt/g&#8208;C3N4/TiO2/IrOx hollow sphere for photocatalytic water splitting. The two cocatalysts, Pt and IrOx, are spatially separated along the Z&#8208;scheme charge&#8208;transfer pathway within the g&#8208;C3N4/TiO2 heterojunction. The synergistic effect of the spatial separation of cocatalysts and the Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction boosts charge separation/transfer, leading to superior and stable photocatalytic H2 evolution in water.

         <title>Planar Optical Cavities Hybridized with Low&#8208;Dimensional Light&#8208;Emitting Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 4, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;dimensional light&#8208;emitting materials have presented peculiar optical and optoelectronic properties, unlike their bulk form. The light&#8211;matter interaction of these emitters can be engineered by integrating with various planar optical cavities, which is a planar nano&#8208; and microstructure that tightly confines light. These integrations provide opportunities for realizing nanophotonic devices based on the new physics allowed by low&#8208;dimensional emitters.








Abstract
Low&#8208;dimensional light&#8208;emitting materials have been actively investigated due to their unprecedented optical and optoelectronic properties that are not observed in their bulk forms. However, the emission from low&#8208;dimensional light&#8208;emitting materials is generally weak and difficult to use in nanophotonic devices without being amplified and engineered by optical cavities. Along with studies on various planar optical cavities over the last decade, the physics of cavity&#8211;emitter interactions as well as various integration methods are investigated deeply. These integrations not only enhance the light&#8211;matter interaction of the emitters, but also provide opportunities for realizing nanophotonic devices based on the new physics allowed by low&#8208;dimensional emitters. In this review, the fundamentals, strengths and weaknesses of various planar optical resonators are first provided. Then, commonly used low&#8208;dimensional light&#8208;emitting materials such as 0D emitters (quantum dots and upconversion nanoparticles) and 2D emitters (transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenide and hexagonal boron nitride) are discussed. The integration of these emitters and cavities and the expect interplay between them are explained in the following chapters. Finally, a comprehensive discussion and outlook of nanoscale cavity&#8208;emitter integrated systems is provided.

         <title>Dynamic Surface Evolution of Metal Oxides for Autonomous Adaptation to Catalytic Reaction Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 4, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dynamic self&#8208;reorganization of as&#8208;prepared materials during catalytic reactions brings about novel catalytic properties. A thorough overview of how the surfaces of metal oxides are reorganized at the nanoscale under diverse (electro)chemical reaction conditions is presented. Also, how the surface changes influence catalytic functionality is discussed from experimental and theoretical standpoints, presenting valuable design guidelines for future energy materials.








Abstract
Metal oxides possessing distinctive physical/chemical properties due to different crystal structures and stoichiometries play a pivotal role in numerous current technologies, especially heterogeneous catalysis for production/conversion of high&#8208;valued chemicals and energy. To date, many researchers have investigated the effect of the structure and composition of these materials on their reactivity to various chemical and electrochemical reactions. However, metal oxide surfaces evolve from their initial form under dynamic reaction conditions due to the autonomous behaviors of the constituent atoms to adapt to the surrounding environment. Such nanoscale surface phenomena complicate reaction mechanisms and material properties, interrupting the clarification of the origin of functionality variations in reaction environments. In this review, the current findings on the spontaneous surface reorganization of metal oxides during reactions are categorized into three types: 1) the appearance of nano&#8208;sized second phase from oxides, 2) the (partial) encapsulation of oxide atoms toward supported metal surfaces, and 3) the oxide surface reconstruction with selective cation leaching in aqueous solution. Then their effects on each reaction are summarized in terms of activity and stability, providing novel insight for those who design metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;based catalytic materials.

         <dc:description>
Polymeric materials indispensable to building safe, high&#8208;energy&#8208;density advanced batteries, in terms of electrode integrity, interface stability, and extending operational limits, are reviewed.

Abstract
Riding on the rapid growth in electric vehicles and the stationary energy storage market, high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries and next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries (i.e., advanced batteries) have been long&#8208;accepted as essential building blocks for future technology reaching the specific energy density of 400&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at the cell&#8208;level. Such progress, mainly driven by the emerging electrode materials or electrolytes, necessitates the development of polymeric materials with advanced functionalities in the battery to address new challenges. Therefore, it is urgently required to understand the basic chemistry and essential research directions in polymeric materials and establish a library for the polymeric materials that enables the development of advanced batteries. Herein, based on indispensable polymeric materials in advanced high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion, lithium&#8211;sulfur, lithium&#8208;metal, and dual&#8208;ion battery chemistry, the key research directions of polymeric materials for achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and safety are summarized and design strategies for further improving performance are examined. Furthermore, the challenges of polymeric materials for advanced battery technologies are discussed.

         <title>Advances in Biodegradable Electronic Skin: Material Progress and Recent Applications in Sensing, Robotics, and Human&#8211;Machine Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 4, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developments of biodegradable electronic skins (e&#8208;skins) have attracted considerable attention for successful application in wearable biosensors, artificial intelligence, physiological signal monitoring, robotics, and prosthetics. Progress in materials and various strategies for performance improvement of biodegradable e&#8208;skins and flexible electronics are comprehensively described. The most recent research advances, current challenges, and future perspectives are also outlined and extrapolated to future applications.








Abstract
The rapid growth of the electronics industry and proliferation of electronic materials and telecommunications technologies has led to the release of a massive amount of untreated electronic waste (e&#8208;waste) into the environment. Consequently, catastrophic environmental damage at the microbiome level and serious human health diseases threaten the natural fate of the planet. Currently, the demand for wearable electronics for applications in personalized medicine, electronic skins (e&#8208;skins), and health monitoring is substantial and growing. Therefore, &#8220;green&#8221; characteristics such as biodegradability, self&#8208;healing, and biocompatibility ensure the future application of wearable electronics and e&#8208;skins in biomedical engineering and bioanalytical sciences. Leveraging the biodegradability, sustainability, and biocompatibility of natural materials will dramatically influence the fabrication of environmentally friendly e&#8208;skins and wearable electronics. Here, the molecular and structural characteristics of biological skins and artificial e&#8208;skins are discussed. The focus then turns to the biodegradable materials, including natural and synthetic&#8208;polymer&#8208;based materials, and their recent applications in the development of biodegradable e&#8208;skin in wearable sensors, robotics, and human&#8211;machine interfaces (HMIs). Finally, the main challenges and outlook regarding the preparation and application of biodegradable e&#8208;skins are critically discussed in a near&#8208;future scenario, which is expected to lead to the next generation of biodegradable e&#8208;skins.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rapid growth of the electronics industry and proliferation of electronic materials and telecommunications technologies has led to the release of a massive amount of untreated electronic waste (e-waste) into the environment. Consequently, catastrophic environmental damage at the microbiome level and serious human health diseases threaten the natural fate of the planet. Currently, the demand for wearable electronics for applications in personalized medicine, electronic skins (e-skins), and health monitoring is substantial and growing. Therefore, &#8220;green&#8221; characteristics such as biodegradability, self-healing, and biocompatibility ensure the future application of wearable electronics and e-skins in biomedical engineering and bioanalytical sciences. Leveraging the biodegradability, sustainability, and biocompatibility of natural materials will dramatically influence the fabrication of environmentally friendly e-skins and wearable electronics. Here, the molecular and structural characteristics of biological skins and artificial e-skins are discussed. The focus then turns to the biodegradable materials, including natural and synthetic-polymer-based materials, and their recent applications in the development of biodegradable e-skin in wearable sensors, robotics, and human&#8211;machine interfaces (HMIs). Finally, the main challenges and outlook regarding the preparation and application of biodegradable e-skins are critically discussed in a near-future scenario, which is expected to lead to the next generation of biodegradable e-skins.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>New Approaches to Produce Large&#8208;Area Single Crystal Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 4, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review introduces novel synthetic strategies to produce large&#8208;area single crystal thin films of various materials and discusses the technological challenges of dealing with the isostructured crystals (3D materials such as metals, III&#8208;V semiconductors, oxide perovskites, halide perovskites, organic semiconductors) and anisotropic crystals (2D materials such as graphene, hBN, and metal chalcogenides).








Abstract
Wafer&#8208;scale growth of single crystal thin films of metals, semiconductors, and insulators is crucial for manufacturing high&#8208;performance electronic and optical devices, but still challenging from both scientific and industrial perspectives. Recently, unconventional advanced synthetic approaches have been attempted and have made remarkable progress in diversifying the species of producible single crystal thin films. This review introduces several new synthetic approaches to produce large&#8208;area single crystal thin films of various materials according to the concepts and principles.

         <title>Heterogenization of Molecular Electrocatalytic Active Sites through Reticular Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 4, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Considering the importance of electrochemical catalysis in energy conversion reactions, in this review, notable active sites of molecular and heterogeneous electrocatalysts are identified. The recent progress in metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based electrochemical catalysis, which primarily involves active site heterogenization through reticular chemistry, is also overviewed. Finally, the design strategies for the assembly of effective MOF&#8208;based electrocatalysts are discussed.








Abstract
The electrochemical conversion of small molecules, such as CO2, O2, and H2O, has received significant attention as a potential engine for sustainable life. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are a promising class of electrocatalytic materials for such processes. An attractive aspect of utilizing this class of materials as electrocatalysts is that well&#8208;known molecular active sites can be introduced to well&#8208;defined crystalline heterogeneous catalytic systems with high tunability. This review offers strategic insights into recent studies on MOF&#8208;based electrocatalysts by discussing the notable active sites that have been utilized in both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts, while highlighting instances where such active sites have been introduced into MOFs. In addition, material design principles enabling the integration of electrochemically active components with the MOF platform are outlined. Viewpoints on the viability of MOFs as an alternative to currently used electrocatalysts are also discussed. Finally, the future direction of MOF&#8208;based electrocatalysis research is established.

         <title>Programmable Synthesis of Biobased Materials Using Cell&#8208;Free Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 4, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cell&#8208;free systems utilize the bioactivity of key cellular reactions&#8212;transcription and translation&#8212;in vitro, where the restriction of sustaining life is eliminated. Supplementation of exogenous genes or substrates into the reactions enables the production of a wide variety of innovative materials beyond the capability of living systems.








Abstract
Motivated by the intricate mechanisms underlying biomolecule syntheses in cells that chemistry is currently unable to mimic, researchers have harnessed biological systems for manufacturing novel materials. Cell&#8208;free systems (CFSs) utilizing the bioactivity of transcriptional and translational machineries in vitro are excellent tools that allow supplementation of exogenous materials for production of innovative materials beyond the capability of natural biological systems. Herein, recent studies that have advanced the ability to expand the scope of biobased materials using CFS are summarized and approaches enabling the production of high&#8208;value materials, prototyping of genetic parts and modules, and biofunctionalization are discussed. By extending the reach of chemical and enzymatic reactions complementary to cellular materials, CFSs provide new opportunities at the interface of materials science and synthetic biology.

         <title>Liquid Crystalline Systems from Nature and Interaction of Living Organisms with Liquid Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 4, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomaterials have been extensively explored to understand living organisms and obtain scientific inspiration. However, many aspects are not still fully understood. Because liquid crystalline phases are ubiquitous, therefore, a wide range of research has made attempts to approach unresolved issues with the concept of liquid crystals (LCs). This review presents these studies addressing the interactive correlation between biomaterials and LCs.








Abstract
Biomaterials, which are substances interacting with biological systems, have been extensively explored to understand living organisms and obtain scientific inspiration (such as biomimetics). However, many aspects of biomaterials have yet to be fully understood. Because liquid crystalline phases are ubiquitously found in biomaterials (e.g., cholesterol, amphiphile, DNA, cellulose, bacteria), therefore, a wide range of research has made attempts to approach unresolved issues with the concept of liquid crystals (LCs). This review presents these studies that address the interactive correlation between biomaterials and LCs. Specifically, intrinsic LC behavior of various biomaterials such as DNA, cellulose nanocrystals, and bacteriaare first introduced. Second, the dynamics of bacteria in LC media are addressed, with focus on how bacteria interact with LCs, and how dynamics of bacteria can be controlled by exploiting the characteristics of LCs. Lastly, how the strong correlation between LCs and biomaterials has been leveraged to design a new class of biosensors with additional functionalities (e.g., self&#8208;regulated drug release) that are not available in previous systems is reviewed. Examples addressed in this review convey the message that the intersection between biomaterials and LCs offers deep insights into fundamental understanding of biomaterials, and provides resources for development of transformative technologies.

         <title>Engineering Grain Boundaries in Two&#8208;Dimensional Electronic Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 4, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Grain boundary engineering in 2D electronic materials for emergent properties is reviewed. Reported structural engineering methods and emergent properties are introduced for various stacking and stitching boundaries such as twist boundary, tilt boundary, stacking fault, and dislocation arrays. Also, remaining challenges and outlook for the future research directions are discussed.








Abstract
Engineering the boundary structures in 2D materials provides an unprecedented opportunity to program the physical properties of the materials with extensive tunability and realize innovative devices with advanced functionalities. However, structural engineering technology is still in its infancy, and creating artificial boundary structures with high reproducibility remains difficult. In this review, various emergent properties of 2D materials with different grain boundaries, and the current techniques to control the structures, are introduced. The remaining challenges for scalable and reproducible structure control and the outlook on the future directions of the related techniques are also discussed.

Nanochitins have recently attracted attention as a source of advanced green materials. Recent advances in molecular&#8208; and nanoscience have enabled the development of chitin nanostructures exhibiting physicochemical and biological properties depending on the length scale. This review summarizes new perspectives in developing sustainable advanced functional materials based on nanochitins with multiscale properties.








Abstract
Nanochitin and nanochitosan (with random&#8208;copolymer&#8208;based multiscale architectures of glucosamine and N&#8208;acetylglucosamine units) have recently attracted immense attention for the development of green, sustainable, and advanced functional materials. Nanochitin and nanochitosan are multiscale materials from small oligomers, rod&#8208;shaped nanocrystals, longer nanofibers, to hierarchical assemblies of nanofibers. Various physical properties of chitin and chitosan depend on their molecular&#8208; and nanostructures; translational research has utilized them for a wide range of applications (biomedical, industrial, environmental, and so on). Instead of reviewing the entire extensive literature on chitin and chitosan, here, recent developments in multiscale&#8208;dependent material properties and their applications are highlighted; immune, medical, reinforcing, adhesive, green electrochemical materials, biological scaffolds, and sustainable food packaging are discussed considering the size, shape, and assembly of chitin nanostructures. In summary, new perspectives for the development of sustainable advanced functional materials based on nanochitin and nanochitosan by understanding and engineering their multiscale properties are described.

         <title>Molecular&#8208;Switch&#8208;Embedded Solution&#8208;Processed Semiconductors</title>

         <dc:description>
Under the banner of &#8220;More than Moore,&#8221; the key to developing solution&#8208;processed semiconductor&#8208;based optoelectronic devices is to add additional functionality to a limited space. Molecular switches can induce transitions between metastable isomers by non&#8208;destructive stimuli, effectively amplifying the functionality of optoelectronic devices when embedded in semiconductors. This review categorizes and discusses molecular&#8208;switch&#8208;embedded optoelectronic devices according to their operating mechanisms.








Abstract
Recent improvements in the performance of solution&#8208;processed semiconductor materials and optoelectronic devices have shifted research interest to the diversification/advancement of their functionality. Embedding a molecular switch capable of transition between two or more metastable isomers by light stimuli is one of the most straightforward and widely accepted methods to potentially realize the multifunctionality of optoelectronic devices. A molecular switch embedded in a semiconductor can effectively control various parameters such as trap&#8208;level, dielectric constant, electrical resistance, charge mobility, and charge polarity, which can be utilized in photoprogrammable devices including transistors, memory, and diodes. This review classifies the mechanism of each optoelectronic transition driven by molecular switches regardless of the type of semiconductor material or molecular switch or device. In addition, the basic characteristics of molecular switches and the persisting technical/scientific issues corresponding to each mechanism are discussed to help researchers. Finally, interesting yet infrequently reported applications of molecular switches and their mechanisms are also described.

Hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) has attracted great interest motivated by fascinating properties in the fields of quantum optics, electronics, and optoelectronics. The most recent discoveries of structural, optical, and electrical properties of h&#8208;BN and advancements in emerging photonic and electronic applications are reviewed.








Abstract
Hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN), an insulating 2D layered material, has recently attracted tremendous interest motivated by the extraordinary properties it shows across the fields of optoelectronics, quantum optics, and electronics, being exotic material platforms for various applications. At an early stage of h&#8208;BN research, it is&#160;explored as an ideal substrate and insulating layers for other 2D materials due to its atomically flat surface that is free of dangling bonds and charged impurities, and its high thermal conductivity. Recent discoveries of structural and optical properties of h&#8208;BN have expanded potential applications into emerging electronics and photonics fields. h&#8208;BN shows a very efficient deep&#8208;ultraviolet band&#8208;edge emission despite its indirect&#8208;bandgap nature, as well as stable room&#8208;temperature single&#8208;photon emission over a wide wavelength range, showing a great potential for next&#8208;generation photonics. In addition, h&#8208;BN is extensively being adopted as active media for low&#8208;energy electronics, including nonvolatile resistive switching memory, radio&#8208;frequency devices, and low&#8208;dielectric&#8208;constant materials for next&#8208;generation electronics.

         <title>Key Factors Affecting the Stability of CsPbI3 Perovskite Quantum Dot Solar Cells: A Comprehensive Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 4, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review intensively discusses the stability issues and strategies to overcome them in CsPbI3 perovskite quantum dot solar (PQD) cells. The detailed degradation mechanisms of CsPbI3 PQDs are provided from the material and device architectural viewpoints. Furthermore, related design strategies for stable CsPbI3 PQD solar cells along with possible future perspectives are proposed.








Abstract
The power conversion efficiency of CsPbI3 perovskite quantum dot (PQD) solar cells shows increase from 10.77% to 16.2% in a short period owing to advances in material and device design for solar cells. However, the device stability of CsPbI3 PQD solar cells remains poor in ambient conditions, which requires an in&#8208;depth understanding of the degradation mechanisms of CsPbI3 PQDs solar cells in terms of both inherent material properties and device characteristics. Along with this analysis, advanced strategies to overcome poor device stability must be conceived. In this review, fundamental mechanisms that cause the degradation of CsPbI3 PQD solar cells are discussed from the material property and device viewpoints. In addition, based on detailed insights into degradation mechanisms in CsPbI3 PQD solar cells, various strategies are introduced to improve the stability of CsPbI3 PQD solar cells. Finally, future perspectives and challenges are presented to achieve highly durable CsPbI3 PQD solar cells. The investigation of the degradation mechanisms and the stability enhancement strategies can pave the way for the commercialization of CsPbI3 PQD solar cells.

         <title>Advances in Colloidal Building Blocks: Toward Patchy Colloidal Clusters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 4, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microspheres, colloidal clusters, spherical patchy particles, patchy colloidal clusters, and asymmetric patchy clusters have been developed sequentially. They can be assembled into opals, the laves phase, colloidal molecules or chains, colloidal cubic diamonds, and colloidal chiral structures, respectively.








Abstract
The scalable synthetic route to colloidal atoms has significantly advanced over the past two decades. Recently, colloidal clusters with DNA&#8208;coated cores called &#8220;patchy colloidal clusters&#8221; have been developed, providing a directional bonding with specific angle of rotation due to the shape complementarity between colloidal clusters. Through a DNA&#8208;mediated interlocking process, they are directly assembled into low&#8208;coordination colloidal structures, such as cubic diamond lattices. Herein, the significant progress in recent years in the synthesis of patchy colloidal clusters and their assembly in experiments and simulations is reviewed. Furthermore, an outlook is given on the emerging approaches to the patchy colloidal clusters and their potential applications in photonic crystals, metamaterials, topological photonic insulators, and separation membranes.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;assisted Nanozyme Design: Lessons from Materials and Engineered Enzymes</title>

Abstract
Nanozymes are nanomaterials that exhibit enzyme&#8208;like biomimicry. In combination with intrinsic characteristics of nanomaterials, nanozymes have broad applicability in materials science, chemical engineering, bioengineering, biochemistry, and disease theranostics. Recently, the heterogeneity of published results highlights the complexity and diversity of nanozymes in terms of consistency of catalytic capacity. Machine learning (ML) shows promising potential for discovering new materials, yet it remains challenging to design new nanozymes based on ML approaches. Alternatively, ML has been employed to promote optimization of intelligent design and application of catalytic materials and engineered enzymes. Incorporation of the successful ML algorithms used in the intelligent design of catalytic materials and engineered enzymes can concomitantly facilitate the guided development of next&#8208;generation nanozymes with desirable properties. Here, we summarize recent progress in ML, its utilization in the design of catalytic materials and enzymes, and how emergent ML applications serve as promising strategies to circumvent challenges associated with time&#8208;expensive and laborious testing in nanozyme research and development. The potential applications of successful examples of ML&#8208;aided catalytic materials and engineered enzymes in nanozyme design are also highlighted, with special focus on the unified aims in enhancing design and recapitulation of substrate selectivity and catalytic activity.

         <title>Hierarchical Porous Monoliths of Steel with Self&#8208;Reinforcing Adaptive Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous steel structures combining ultralow weight and high mechanical efficiency are manufactured by printing, reducing, and sintering wet foams containing iron oxide precursor particles. By forming new load&#8208;bearing struts when compressed, the porous structures are able to reversibly stiffen in response to nonuniform stresses, a behavior that conceptually resembles the unique adaptive properties of human bone.








Abstract
Porous structures offer an attractive approach to reduce the amount of natural resources used while maintaining relatively high mechanical efficiency. However, for some applications the drop in mechanical properties resulting from the introduction of porosity is too high, which has limited the broader utilization of porous materials in industry. Here, it is shown that steel monoliths can be designed to display high mechanical efficiency and reversible self&#8208;reinforcing properties when made with porous architectures with up to three hierarchical levels. Ultralight steel structures that can float on water and autonomously adapt their stiffness are manufactured by the thermal reduction and sintering of 3D printed foam templates. Using distinct mechanical testing techniques, image analysis, and finite element simulations, the mechanisms leading to the high mechanical efficiency and self&#8208;stiffening ability of the hierarchical porous monoliths are studied. The design and fabrication of mechanically stable porous monoliths using iron as a widely available natural resource is expected to contribute to the future development of functional materials with a more sustainable footprint.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Locked Tandem Fluorescent Probe for Imaging of Pyroptosis in Cancer Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;locked and tandem activatable probe (DTAP) is presented for real&#8208;time near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging of intratumoral pyroptosis during cancer chemo&#8208;immunotherapy in living mice. It provides a non&#8208;invasive tool to study the regulatory mechanism of pyroptosis during cancer therapy and predict cancer therapeutic efficacy, hence capable of being applied to optimize cancer chemo&#8208;immunotherapies for precision medicine.








Abstract
Real&#8208;time imaging of programmed cancer cell death (PCD) is imperative to monitor cancer therapeutic efficacy and tailor therapeutic regimens; however, specific in vivo detection of intratumoral pyroptosis remains challenging. Herein, a dual&#8208;locked and tandem activatable probe (DTAP) is reported for near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging of intratumoral pyroptosis during cancer chemo&#8208;immunotherapy in living mice. The probe comprises a hemicyanine dye dual&#8208;locked with an enzyme&#8208;responsive moiety that can be tandemly cleaved by pyroptosis&#8208;related biomarker (Caspase&#8208;1) and cancer biomarker (GGT) to turn on its NIRF signal. As pyroptosis plays a vital role in triggering anti&#8208;tumor immune responses, the activated signal of DTAP correlates well with the population of tumor&#8208;infiltrating cytotoxic T lymphocytes and tumor growth inhibition, consequently permitting the prediction of cancer therapeutic efficacy. This study also provides a non&#8208;invasive technique to study the regulatory mechanism of pyroptosis in cancer therapy and to optimize cancer chemo&#8208;immunotherapies for precision medicine.

         <title>Understanding Self&#8208;Assembly of Silica&#8208;Precipitating Peptides to Control Silica Particle Morphology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomimetic silaffin&#8208;based peptides give rise to different template structures depending on stereochemistry and connectivity of the central residue. NMR experiments help to decipher the peptidic template structures. The resulting structure&#8211;activity relationship provides a key to rationally control the assembly of such peptides and thereby the resulting silica material as the peptidic precursor structures determine the materials final architecture.








Abstract
The most advanced materials are those found in nature. These evolutionary optimized substances provide highest efficiencies, e.g., in harvesting solar energy or providing extreme stability, and are intrinsically biocompatible. However, the mimicry of biological materials is limited to a few successful applications since there is still a lack of the tools to recreate natural materials. Herein, such means are provided based on a peptide library derived from the silaffin protein R5 that enables rational biomimetic materials design. It is now evident that biomaterials do not form via mechanisms observed in vitro. Instead, the material's function and morphology are predetermined by precursors that self&#8208;assemble in solution, often from a combination of protein and salts. These assemblies act as templates for biomaterials. The RRIL peptides used here are a small part of the silica&#8208;precipitation machinery in diatoms. By connecting RRIL motifs via varying central bi&#8208; or trifunctional residues, a library of stereoisomers is generated, which allows characterization of different template structures in the presence of phosphate ions by combining residue&#8208;resolved real&#8208;time NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Understanding these templates in atomistic detail, the morphology of silica particles is controlled via manipulation of the template precursors.

         <dc:description>
Recently reported new methods to induce strain are summarized and discussed, and the latest developments on the modification of electrical, magnetic, and optical properties of 2D materials are updated by strain engineering (in particular properties such as the electrochemical, magnetic and superconducting characteristics, and their strain tuning have received little attention previously), and future perspectives are presented.








Abstract
Strain engineering is a promising way to tune the electrical, electrochemical, magnetic, and optical properties of 2D&#160;materials, with the potential to achieve high&#8208;performance 2D&#8208;material&#8208;based devices ultimately. This review discusses the experimental and theoretical results from recent advances in the strain engineering of 2D materials. Some novel methods to induce strain are summarized and then the tunable electrical and optical/optoelectronic properties of 2D materials via strain engineering are highlighted, including particularly the previously less&#8208;discussed strain tuning of superconducting, magnetic, and electrochemical properties. Also, future perspectives of strain engineering are given for its potential applications in functional devices. The state of the survey presents the ever&#8208;increasing advantages and popularity of strain engineering for tuning properties of 2D materials. Suggestions and insights for further research and applications in optical, electronic, and spintronic devices are provided.

         <title>Intracellular Glucose&#8208;Depriving Polymer Micelles for Antiglycolytic Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A glucose&#8208;responsive polymer is designed, considering the unique metabolism of cancer cells. The polymer exhibits micellar&#8208;structure stability during blood circulation and accumulates in tumor tissues. Specific binding between the polymer and intracellular glucose induces glucose deprivation in tumor cells. Glucose metabolism is particularly inhibited; the lack of energy in tumor cells is intensified, leading to tumor suppression.








Abstract
A new anticancer strategy to exploit abnormal metabolism of cancer cells rather than to merely control the drug release or rearrange the tumor microenvironment is reported. An antiglycolytic amphiphilic polymer, designed considering the unique metabolism of cancer cells (Warburg effect) and aimed at the regulation of glucose metabolism, is synthesized through chemical conjugation between glycol chitosan (GC) and phenylboronic acid (PBA). GC&#8208;PBA derivatives form stable micellar structures under physiological conditions and respond to changes in glucose concentration. Once the micelles accumulate at the tumor site, intracellular glucose capture occurs, and the resultant energy deprivation through the inhibition of aerobic glycolysis remarkably suppresses tumor growth without significant side effects in vivo. This strategy highlights the need to develop safe and effective cancer treatment without the use of conventional anticancer drugs.

An antiglycolytic amphiphilic polymer, designed considering the unique metabolism of cancer cells (Warburg effect) and aimed at the regulation of glucose metabolism, is synthesized through chemical conjugation between glycol chitosan (GC) and phenylboronic acid (PBA). GC-PBA derivatives form stable micellar structures under physiological conditions and respond to changes in glucose concentration. Once the micelles accumulate at the tumor site, intracellular glucose capture occurs, and the resultant energy deprivation through the inhibition of aerobic glycolysis remarkably suppresses tumor growth without significant side effects in vivo. This strategy highlights the need to develop safe and effective cancer treatment without the use of conventional anticancer drugs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>3D Printing of Self&#8208;Assembling Nanofibrous Multidomain Peptide Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multidomain peptides (MDPs), a class of self&#8208;assembling peptides, are used to 3D print complex, 3D structures. Multiple MDPs are demonstrated as printable, and oppositely charged MDPs are printed together into layered, porous constructs. MDPs are found to support high cell viability regardless of charge, while charge is shown to influence cellular behavior and morphology.








Abstract
3D printing has become one of the primary fabrication strategies used in biomedical research. Recent efforts have focused on the 3D printing of hydrogels to create structures that better replicate the mechanical properties of biological tissues. These pose a unique challenge, as soft materials are difficult to pattern in three dimensions with high fidelity. Currently, a small number of biologically derived polymers that form hydrogels are frequently reused for 3D printing applications. Thus, there exists a need for novel hydrogels with desirable biological properties that can be used as 3D printable inks. In this work, the printability of multidomain peptides (MDPs), a class of self&#8208;assembling peptides that form a nanofibrous hydrogel at low concentrations, is established. MDPs with different charge functionalities are optimized as distinct inks and are used to create complex 3D structures, including multi&#8208;MDP prints. Additionally, printed MDP constructs are used to demonstrate charge&#8208;dependent differences in cellular behavior in vitro. This work presents the first time that self&#8208;assembling peptides have been used to print layered structures with overhangs and internal porosity. Overall, MDPs are a promising new class of 3D printable inks that are uniquely peptide&#8208;based and rely solely on supramolecular mechanisms for assembly.

         <title>Picoperovskites: The Smallest Conceivable Isolated Halide Perovskite Structures Formed within Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halide perovskites CsPbBr3 and lead&#8208;free CsSnI3 form &#8220;picoperovskites&#8221; in 1.2&#8211;1.6&#160;nm&#8208;diameter single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes with cross&#8208;sectional unit&#8208;cell or sub&#8208;unit&#8208;cell dimensions. The smallest of these are bilayer inorganic polymers retaining ABX3 stoichiometry while intermediate&#8208;scale Cs3PbBr3 preserves Pb2+ by forming ordered vacancies. The largest Cs4Sn4Ix form alternates Cs4 and Sn4Ix layers along the nanotube cavities.








Abstract
Halide perovskite structures are revolutionizing the design of optoelectronic materials, including solar cells, light&#8208;emitting diodes, and photovoltaics when formed at the quantum scale. Four isolated sub&#8208;nanometer, or picoscale, halide perovskite structures formed inside &#8776;1.2&#8211;1.6&#160;nm single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) by melt insertion from CsPbBr3 and lead&#8208;free CsSnI3 are reported. Three directly relate to the ABX3 perovskite archetype while a fourth is a perovskite&#8208;like lamellar structure with alternating Cs4 and polyhedral Sn4Ix layers. In &#8776;1.4&#160;nm&#8208;diameter SWCNTs, CsPbBr3 forms Cs3PbIIBr5 nanowires, one ABX3 unit cell in cross section with the Pb2+ oxidation state maintained by ordered Cs+ vacancies. Within &#8776;1.2&#160;nm&#8208;diameter SWCNTs, CsPbBr3 and CsSnI3 form inorganic&#8208;polymer&#8208;like bilayer structures, one&#8208;fourth of an ABX3 unit cell in cross section with systematically reproduced ABX3 stoichiometry. Producing these smallest halide perovskite structures at their absolute synthetic cross&#8208;sectional limit enables quantum confinement effects with first&#8208;principles calculations demonstrating bandgap widening compared to corresponding bulk structural forms.

         <title>Upcycling of Waste Plastic into Hybrid Carbon Nanomaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Graphitic one&#8208;dimensional (1D) and hybrid nanomaterials represent a powerful solution in composite and electronic applications due to exceptional properties, but large&#8208;scale synthesis of hybrid materials has yet to be realized. Here, we report a rapid, scalable method to produce graphitic 1D materials from polymers using flash Joule heating (FJH). This avoids lengthy chemical vapor deposition and uses no solvent or water. The flash 1D materials (F1DM), synthesized using a variety of earth&#8208;abundant catalysts, have controllable diameters and morphologies by parameter tuning. Furthermore, the process can be modified to form hybrid materials, with F1DM bonded to turbostratic graphene. In nanocomposites, F1DM outperform commercially available carbon nanotubes. Compared to current 1D material synthetic strategies using life cycle assessment, FJH synthesis represents an 86&#8211;92% decrease in cumulative energy demand and 92&#8211;94% decrease in global warming potential. Our work suggests that FJH affords a cost&#8208;effective and sustainable route to upcycle waste plastic into valuable 1D and hybrid nanomaterials.

         <title>Graph Analysis with Multifunctional Self&#8208;Rectifying Memristive Crossbar Array</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A graph analysis based on the desired sneak current is performed using a self&#8208;rectifying memristor and a &#8220;metal cell at diagonalcrossbar array (mCBA)&#8221; structure. mCBA effectively extracts hidden information from complex networks without preprocessing and loss of information. Three graph algorithms (pathfinding, link prediction, community detection) and brain network&#8208;based attention&#8208;deficit/hyperactivity disorder classification are performed effectively based on the mCBA.








Abstract
Many big data have interconnected and dynamic graph structures growing over time. Analyzing these graphical data requires the hidden relationship between the nodes in the graphs to be identified, which has conventionally been achieved by finding the effective similarity. However, graphs are generally non&#8208;Euclidean, which does not allow finding it. In this study, the non&#8208;Euclidean graphs are mapped to a specific crossbar array (CBA) composed of self&#8208;rectifying memristors and metal cells at the diagonal positions. The sneak current, an intrinsic physical property in the CBA, allows for the identification of the similarity function. The sneak&#8208;current&#8208;based similarity function indicates the distance between the nodes, which can be used to predict the probability that unconnected nodes will be connected in the future, connectivity between communities, and neural connections in a brain. When all bit lines of the CBA are connected to the ground, the sneak current is suppressed, and the CBA can be used to search for adjacent nodes. This work demonstrates the physical calculation methods applied to various graphical problems&#160;using the CBA composed of the self&#8208;rectifying memristor based on the HfO2 switching layer. Moreover, such applications suffer less from the memristors&#8217; inherent issues related to their stochastic nature.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Water Harvesting and Concurrent Carbon Capture: A Review for Hygroscopic Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
As water scarcity becomes a pending global issue, hygroscopic materials prove a significant solution. Thus, there is a good cause following the structure&#8208;performance relationship to review the recent development of hygroscopic materials&#160;and provide inspirational insight of&#160;creative materials. Herein, traditional hygroscopic materials, crystalline frameworks,&#160;polymers, and composite materials are reviewed. The similarity in working conditions of water harvesting and carbon capture makes the simultaneous addressing of the water shortage and reduction of greenhouse effects possible. The concurrent water harvesting and carbon capture is&#160;likely to become a future challenge. Therefore, an emphasis is laid on MOFs for the excellent performance in water and CO2&#160;adsorption, and representative role of micro&#8208; and meso&#8208;porous materials. The water adsorption mechanisms of MOFs are summarized, followed by a review of MOF's water stabilit, with a highlight on the emerging machine learning (ML) technique to predict MOF water stability and water uptake. Recent advances in the mechanistic elaboration of moisture's effects on CO2&#160;adsorption are reviewed.&#160;This review summarizes recent advances in water harvesting porous materials with special attention on MOFs and expects to direct researchers&#8217; attention into the topic of concurrent water harvesting and carbon capture as a future challenge.

Herein, traditional hygroscopic materials, crystalline frameworks,&#160;polymers, and composite materials are reviewed. The similarity in working conditions of water harvesting and carbon capture makes the simultaneous addressing of the water shortage and reduction of greenhouse effects possible. The concurrent water harvesting and carbon capture is&#160;likely to become a future challenge. Therefore, an emphasis is laid on MOFs for the excellent performance in water and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;adsorption, and representative role of micro- and meso-porous materials. The water adsorption mechanisms of MOFs are summarized, followed by a review of MOF's water stabilit, with a highlight on the emerging machine learning (ML) technique to predict MOF water stability and water uptake. Recent advances in the mechanistic elaboration of moisture's effects on CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;adsorption are reviewed.&#160;This review summarizes recent advances in water harvesting porous materials with special attention on MOFs and expects to direct researchers&#8217; attention into the topic of concurrent water harvesting and carbon capture as a future challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Compressible Polymer Composites with Enhanced Dielectric Temperature Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
High&#8208;dielectric&#8208;constants polymer composites have broad application prospects in flexible electronics and electrostatic energy storage capacitors. Substantial enhancement in dielectric constants (&#949;r) of polymer composites so far can only be obtained at high loading of nanofillers, resulting in high dielectric loss and high elastic modulus of polymer composites. Addressing the polarization shielding and the consequent polarization discontinuity at polymer/filler interfaces has been a long&#8208;standing challenge to achieve flexible polymer composite with high &#949;r. Herein, we propose and demonstrate a polymer composite with interconnected BaTiO3 (BT) ceramic scaffold exhibiting a high &#949;r &#8764; 210 at low BT volume fraction of &#8764; 18&#160;vol.%, approaching the upper limit predicted by the parallel model. By incorporating relaxor Ba(ZrxTi1&#8208;x)O3 phase in BT scaffold, we further achieved excellent dielectric temperature stability with &#916;&#949;r below &#177;10% within broad temperature range (25&#8208;140&#160;&#176;C). Moreover, the dielectric performances remain stable under compressive strain up to 80%. This work provides a facile approach to construct large&#8208;scale polymer composites with robust dielectric performance against changes in thermal and mechanical condition, which are promising for high&#8208;temperature applications in flexible electronics.

         <title>Surface Energy Regulated Growth of &#945;&#8208;phase Cs0.03FA0.97PbI3 for Highly Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Methylammonium (MA) free formamidine (FA) dominated CsxFA(1&#8208;x)PbI3 is rising as the most promising candidate for highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells. However, the growth of high quality CsxFA(1&#8208;x)PbI3 black phase perovskite structure without ion doping in lattice remains to be a challenge. Herein, we synthesized a propeller&#8208;shaped halogenated tertiary ammonium showing high binding energy on perovskite surface and large steric hindrance. This molecule can significantly reduce the barrier of high surface energy that suppress the growth of &#945;&#8208;phase CsxFA(1&#8208;x)PbI3 structure. As a result, &#945;&#8208;phase structure can be formed at room temperature, which can further act as seed for the growth of high&#8208;quality film. Solar cells based on the film show a record efficiency up to 23.6% for MA free CsxFA1&#8208;xPbI3 solar cells with inverted structure, and excellent stability at 85&#176;C over 200 hours.

         <title>Origin of the Anomalous Electrical Transport Behavior in Fe Intercalated Weyl Semimetal Td&#8208;MoTe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Weyl semimetal Td&#8208;MoTe2 has recently attracted much attention due to its intriguing electronic properties and potential applications in spintronic. Here, Fe intercalated Td&#8208;FexMoTe2 single crystals (0 &lt;x &lt; 0.15 ) are grown successfully. The electrical and thermoelectric transport results consistently demonstrate that the phase transition temperature TS is gradually suppressed with increasing x. Theoretical calculation suggests that the increased energy of Td phase, enhanced transition barrier and more occupied bands in 1T&#8242; phase are responsible for the suppression in TS. In addition, a &#961;&#8733; &#8208;ln T behavior induced by Kondo effect is observed with x &#10878; 0.08, due to the coupling between conduction carriers and the local magnetic moments of intercalated Fe atoms. For Td&#8208;Fe0.15MoTe2, a spin&#8208;glass transition occurs at about 10K. The calculated band structure of Td&#8208;Fe0.25MoTe2 shows that two flat bands exist near the Fermi level, which are mainly contributed by the dyz and dx2&#8722;y2$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals of Fe atoms. Finally, the electronic phase diagram of Td&#8208;FexMoTe2 has been established for the first time. Our&#160;work provides a new route to control the structural instability and explore exotic electronic states for transition&#8208;metal&#160;dichalcogenides.

         <title>Photoelectrochemical Glycerol Conversion over a Mie Scattering Effect&#8208;Enhanced Porous BiVO4 Photoanode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The photoelectrochemical (PEC) oxidation of glycerol (GLY) to high value&#8208;added dihydroxyacetone (DHA) can be achieved over the BiVO4 photoanode, while the PEC performance of most BiVO4 photoanodes is impeded due to the upper limits of the photocurrent density. In this work, an enhanced Mie scattering effect of a well&#8208;documented porous BiVO4 photoanode is obtained with less effort by a simple annealing process, which significantly reduces the reflectivity to near zero. The great light absorbability increases the basic photocurrent density by 1.77 times. The selective oxidation of GLY over the BiVO4 photoanode results in a photocurrent density of 6.04 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2 and a DHA production rate of 325.2 mmol&#183;m&#8722;2&#183;h&#8722;1 that exceeds all reported values. This work addresses the poor ability of nanostructured BiVO4 to harvest light, paving the way for further improvements in charge transport and transfer to realize highly efficient PEC conversion.

         <title>A General Strategy to Remove Metal Aggregates toward Metal&#8208;Nitrogen&#8208;Carbon Catalysts with Exclusive Atomic Dispersion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Metal&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;doped nanocarbons (M&#8208;N&#8208;Cs) are promising alternatives to precious metals for catalyzing electrochemical energy conversion processes. However, M&#8208;N&#8208;Cs synthesized by high&#8208;temperature pyrolysis frequently suffer from compositional heterogeneity with the simultaneous presence of atomically dispersed M&#8208;Nx sites and crystalline metal nanoparticles (NPs), which hinders the identification of active sites and rational optimization in performance. Herein, we report a universal and efficient strategy to obtain both precious and non&#8208;precious metal&#8208;based M&#8208;N&#8208;Cs (M = Pt, Fe, Co, Ni, Mn, Cu, Zn) with exclusive atomic dispersion by making use of ammonium iodide as the etchant to remove excessive metal aggregates at high temperature. Taking Pt&#8208;N&#8208;C as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, the complete removal of Pt NPs in Pt&#8208;N&#8208;C enables the clarification on the contributions of the atomic Pt&#8208;Nx moieties and Pt NPs to the catalytic activity toward the hydrogen evolution reaction. Combined electrochemical measurements and theoretical calculations identify that the atomic Pt&#8208;Nx moieties by themselves possess negligible activity, but they could significantly boost the activity of the Pt NPs via the synergistic effect.

&lt;p&gt;Metal- and nitrogen-doped nanocarbons (M-N-Cs) are promising alternatives to precious metals for catalyzing electrochemical energy conversion processes. However, M-N-Cs synthesized by high-temperature pyrolysis frequently suffer from compositional heterogeneity with the simultaneous presence of atomically dispersed M-N&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; sites and crystalline metal nanoparticles (NPs), which hinders the identification of active sites and rational optimization in performance. Herein, we report a universal and efficient strategy to obtain both precious and non-precious metal-based M-N-Cs (M = Pt, Fe, Co, Ni, Mn, Cu, Zn) with exclusive atomic dispersion by making use of ammonium iodide as the etchant to remove excessive metal aggregates at high temperature. Taking Pt-N-C as a proof-of-concept demonstration, the complete removal of Pt NPs in Pt-N-C enables the clarification on the contributions of the atomic Pt-N&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; moieties and Pt NPs to the catalytic activity toward the hydrogen evolution reaction. Combined electrochemical measurements and theoretical calculations identify that the atomic Pt-N&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; moieties by themselves possess negligible activity, but they could significantly boost the activity of the Pt NPs via the synergistic effect.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Exsolution Modeling and Control to Improve the Catalytic Activity of Nanostructured Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
In situ exsolution for nanoscale electrode design has attracted considerable attention because of its promising activity and high stability. However, fundamental research on the mechanisms underlying particle growth remains insufficient. Herein, cation diffusion&#8208;determined exsolution is presented using an analytical model based on classical nucleation and diffusion. In the designed perovskite system, the exsolution trend for particle growth is consistent with our diffusion model, which strongly depends on the initial cation concentration and reduction conditions. Based on the experimental and theoretical results, a highly Ni&#8208;doped anode and an electrochemical switching technique are employed to promote exsolution and overcome growth limitations. The optimal cell exhibits an outstanding maximum power density of 1.7&#160;W cm&#8722;2 at 900&#176;C and shows no evident degradation when operating at 800&#176;C for 240&#160;h under wet H2. This study provides crucial insights into the developing and tuning of heterogeneous catalysts for energy&#8208;conversion applications.

         <title>Encapsulating High&#8208;Temperature Superconducting Twisted van der Waals Heterostructures Blocks Detrimental Effects of Disorder</title>

Abstract
High&#8208;temperature cuprate superconductors (HTS)&#8208;based van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures hold high technological promise. One of the obstacles hindering the progress is the detrimental effect of disorder on the properties of the vdW devices&#8208;based Josephson junctions (JJ). Here we&#160;report the new method of fabricating twisted vdW heterostructures made of Bi2Sr2CuCa2O8 + &#948;&#160;, crucially improving the JJ characteristics and pushing them up to those of the intrinsic JJs in bulk samples. The method combines cryogenic stacking using a solvent&#8208;free stencil mask technique and covering the interface by insulating hexagonal boron nitride crystals. Despite the high&#8208;vacuum condition down to 10&#8722;6mbar in the evaporation chamber, the interface appears to be protected from water molecules during the in&#8208;situ metal deposition only when fully encapsulated. Comparing the current&#8208;voltage curves of encapsulated and unencapsulated interfaces, we&#160;reveal that the encapsulated interfaces' characteristics are crucially improved so that the corresponding JJs demonstrate high critical currents and sharpness of the superconducting transition comparable to those of the intrinsic JJs. Finally, we&#160;show that the encapsulated heterostructures are more stable over&#160;time.

         <title>Unlock Restricted Capacity via O&#8208;Ce Hybridization for Li&#8208;Oxygen Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The aprotic Li&#8208;O2 battery (LOB) has the highest theoretical energy density of any rechargeable batteries. However, such system has been largely restricted by the electrochemically formed lithium peroxide (Li2O2) on the cathode surface, leading ultimately to low actual capacities and early cell death. In contrast to the surface&#8208;mediated growth of thin&#8208;film with thickness less than 50&#160;nm, a non&#8208;crystalline Li2O2 film with thickness of more than 400&#160;nm can be formed via an optimal O&#8208;Ce hybridized electronic structure. Specially, oxygen can react with dissolved cerium cations in the electrolyte via a cerium&#8208;oxygen reaction to form a high&#8208;energy faceted cerium oxide catalyst, which not only generates a great number of non&#8208;saturable active sites, but also erects electron transport bridges between the lattice O and adjacent Ce atoms. Such Ce&#8208;O orbital coupling also forms a direct charge transfer channel from Ce&#8208;4f of CeO2 to O22&#8722;${\rm{O}}_2^{2 - }$&#8208;&#960;* of Li2O2, eventually leading to submicron&#8208;thick Li2O2 shells via a subsequent lithium&#8208;oxygen reaction. Relying on the above merits, this work unlocks the rechargeable capacities of LOB from restricted 1000 to unprecedented 10&#8239;000 mAh g&#8722;1 with good cyclabilities and reduced charge&#8208;discharge overpotentials.

         <title>An Active Pixel&#8208;matrix Electrocaloric Device for Targeted and Differential Thermal Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
More than 55% of electronic failures are caused by damage from localized overheating. Up to now, there is still no efficient method for targeted temperature control against localized overheating. Although some existing thermal management devices handle this issue by full coverage cooling, it generates a lot of useless energy consumption. Here, we report a highly efficient pixel&#8208;matrix electrocaloric (EC) cooling device, which can realize a targeted and differential thermal management. The modified P(VDF&#8208;TrFE&#8208;CFE) reaches a large adiabatic temperature change of 7.8 K and is more suitable for thermal transfer and electrostatic actuation at high frequencies. All active pixels in the EC cooling device exhibit a stable temperature span of 4.6 K and a heat flux of 62&#160;mW/cm2, which is more than twice that of the one&#8208;layer EC device. Each refrigeration pixel can be independently controlled and effectively cool down the localized overheating site(s) in situ. The surface temperature of the simulated CPU decreased by 33.2 K at 120 s after applying this EC device. Such a compact, embeddable, low cost and active solid&#8208;state pixel&#8208;matrix cooling device have a great potential for localized overheating protection in microelectronics.

         <title>Manipulating Polymer Backbone Configuration Via Halogenated Asymmetric End&#8208;Group Enables Over 18% Efficiency All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
High&#8208;performance all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) deeply rely on the joint contributions of desirable optical absorption, adaptive energy level and appropriate morphology. Herein, two structural analogous polymerized small molecule acceptors (PSMAs), PYFCl&#8208;T and PYF&amp;PYCl&#8208;T, were synthesized, and then incorporated into the PM6:PY&#8208;IT binary blends to construct ternary all&#8208;PSCs. Due to the superior compatibility of PY&#8208;IT and PYFCl&#8208;T, the ternary all&#8208;PSC based on PM6:PY&#8208;IT:PYFCl&#8208;T with 10 wt% PYFCl&#8208;T, presented higher and more balanced charge mobilities, suppressed charge recombination, and faster charge transfer kinetics, resulting in an outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.12% with the enhanced Jsc and FF, which is much higher than that (PCE of 16.09%) of the binary all&#8208;PSCs based on PM6:PY&#8208;IT. Besides, the ternary all&#8208;PSCs also exhibited improved photostability. The conspicuous performance enhancement principally should give the credit to the miscibility&#8208;driven phase optimization of the donor and acceptor. These findings highlight the significance of polymer backbone configuration modulation of PSMAs in morphology optimization toward boosting the device properties of all&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Simultaneous Oxidative Cleavage of Lignin and Reduction of Furfural via Efficient Electrocatalysis by P&#8208;doped CoMoO4</title>

Abstract
Electrochemical oxidative lignin cleavage and coupled 2&#8208;furaldehyde reduction provide a promising approach for producing high&#8208;value added products. However, developing efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts with noble metal&#8208;like activity still remains a challenge. Here, we report an efficient electrochemical strategy for the selective oxidative cleavage of C&#945;&#8208;C&#946; bonds in lignin into aromatic monomers by tailoring the electronic structure through P&#8208;doped CoMoO4 spinels (99% conversion, highest monomer selectivity of 56%). Additionally, the conversion and selectivity of 2&#8208;furaldehyde reduction to 2&#8208;methyl furan reached 87% and 73%, respectively. The in situ Fourier transform infrared and density functional theory analysis revealed that an upward shift of the Ed upon P&#8208;doping led to an increase in the antibonding level, which facilitated the C&#945;&#8208;C&#946; adsorption of the lignin model compounds, thereby enhancing the bifunctional electrocatalytic activity of the active site. This work explored the potential of a spinel as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for the oxidative cracking of lignin and the reductive conversion of small organic molecules to high&#8208;value added chemicals via P anion modulation.

         <title>Laser&#8208;Induced Transient Self&#8208;organization of TiNx Nano&#8208;Filament Percolated Networks for High Performance Surface&#8208;Mountable Filter Capacitors</title>

Abstract
Filter capacitors (FCs) are substantial for digital circuits and microelectronic devices, and thus more compact FCs are eternally demanded for system miniaturization. Even though microsupercapacitors are broadly regarded as an excellent candidate for the future FCs, yet due to the limitation of available electrode materials, the capacitive performance of reported MSCs drops sharply under high&#8208;frequency alternating current. Herein, we present a unique laser induced transient self&#8208;organization strategy, which synergizes pulsed laser energy and multi&#8208;physical field controlled coalescence processes, leading to the rapid and controllable preparation of titanium nitride ultrafine nano&#8208;filaments (diameter approximately 3&#8211;5 nm) networks. Their chaotic fractal nanoporous structure, superior specific surface area and excellent conductivity render these nanostructures promising candidates for FCs. Surface&#8208;mounted filter capacitors based on this electrode material exhibit ultra&#8208;long cycle&#8208;life (2,000,000 cycles) with record ultrahigh volumetric energy density of 9.17 mWh cm&#8211;3 at 120 Hz in aqueous electrolyte, displaying advantages in function, size and integratability compared with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art aluminum electrolytic capacitors. The method here provides a versatile toolbox for designing novel nanostructures with intriguing characteristics and insights for developing advanced and miniaturized filter and power devices.

         <title>High&#8208;Gain of NdIII Complex Doped Optical Waveguide Amplifiers at 1.06 and 1.31&#160;&#956;m Wavelengths Based on Intramolecular Energy Transfer Mechanism</title>

Abstract
Chelate phosphine oxide ligand (9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;9H&#8208;xanthene&#8208;4,5&#8208;diyl) bis (diphenylphosphineoxide) (XPO) is prepared as a neutral ligand to synthesize complex Nd (TTA)3 (XPO) (TTA = 2&#8208;thenoyltrifluoroacetone). An appropriate energy gap between the XPO and TTA ligands, which can support two additional energy transfer routines from the first excited triplet state (T1) energy level of the XPO to that of the TTA, improves energy transfer in the Nd complex. Based on intramolecular energy transfer mechanism, optical gains at 1.06 and 1.31&#160;&#956;m are demonstrated in Nd (TTA)3 (XPO)&#8208;doped polymer waveguides with the excitation of low&#8208;power light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) instead of semiconductor lasers as pump sources. Using the vertical top&#8208;pumping mode of a 365&#160;nm LED, relative gains of 22.5 and 8.4&#160;dB cm&#8722;1 are obtained at 1.06 and 1.31&#160;&#956;m, respectively, in a 0.2&#8208;cm long embedded waveguide with a cross&#8208;section of 8 &#215; 5 &#956;m2. The active core layer is Nd (TTA)3 (XPO)&#8208;doped SU&#8208;8 polymer. Moreover, relative gains are achieved in evanescent&#8208;field waveguide with a cross&#8208;section of 6 &#215; 4 &#956;m2. The 21.0 and 5.6&#160;dB cm&#8722;1 relative gains are achieved at 1.06 and 1.31&#160;&#956;m, respectively, with a net gain of 13.8 &#177; 0.3&#160;dB cm&#8722;1 obtained at 1.06&#160;&#956;m in a 0.9&#8208;cm long SU&#8208;8 waveguide with Nd (TTA)3 (XPO)&#8208;doped polymethylmethacrylate as upper cladding.

Abstract
Conventional bulky and rigid planar architecting power systems are difficult to satisfy the growing demand for wearable applications. One&#8208;dimensional fiber batteries bearing appealing features of miniaturization, adaptability, and weavability, represent a promising solution, yet challenges remain pertaining to energy density and scalability. Herein, an ingenious densifiable functional ink is invented to fabricate scalable, flexible, and high mass loading fiber lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) by adopting a fast ink&#8208;extrusion technology. In the formulated ink, pyrrole&#8208;modified reduced graphene oxide (py&#8208;rGO) is elaborately introduced and exerts multiple influences: not only assembles carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF&#8208;HFP) to compose a sturdy, conductive and agglomeration&#8208;free three&#8208;dimensional network that realizes an ultra&#8208;high content (75 wt%) of the active materials and endows the electrode excellent flexibility, but serves as a capillary densification inducer, encouraging an extremely large linear mass loading (1.01&#160;mg cm&#8722;1 per fiber) and packing density (782.1&#160;mg cm&#8722;3). As a result, the assembled fiber LIBs deliver an impressive linear and volumetric energy densities with superb mechanical compliance, demonstrating the best performance among all the reported extruded fiber batteries. This work highlights a highly effective and facile approach to fabricate high&#8208;performance fiber energy storage devices for future practical wearable applications.

         <title>Flattening Grain&#8208;Boundary Grooves for Perovskite Solar Cells with High Opto&#8208;Mechanical Reliability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Opto&#8208;mechanical reliability has emerged as an important criterion for evaluating the performance and commercialization potential of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) due to the mechanical&#8208;property mismatch of metal halide perovskites with other device layers. In this work, grain&#8208;boundary groove, a rarely discussed film microstructural characteristics, is found to impart significant effects on the opto&#8208;mechanical reliability of perovskite&#8208;substrate heterointerfaces and thus PSC performance. By pre&#8208;burying iso&#8208;butylammonium chloride additive in the electron&#8208;transport layer, we flattened GB grooves and created an opto&#8208;mechanically reliable perovskite heterointerface that resists the photothermal fatigue. The improved mechanical integrity of ETL&#8208;perovskite heterointerfaces also benefits the charge transport and chemical stability by facilitating the carrier injection and reducing the moisture or solvent trapping, respectively. Accordingly, we achieved high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells which exhibit efficiency retentions of 94.8% under 440 h damp heat test (85% RH and 85 &#176;C), and 93.0% under 2000 h continuous light soaking.

In this work, grain-boundary groove, a rarely discussed film microstructural characteristics, is found to impart significant effects on the opto-mechanical reliability of perovskite-substrate heterointerfaces and thus PSC performance. By pre-burying iso-butylammonium chloride additive in the electron-transport layer, we flattened GB grooves and created an opto-mechanically reliable perovskite heterointerface that resists the photothermal fatigue.

         <title>Spacer&#8208;engineered Ionic Channels in Covalent Organic Framework Membrane toward Ultrafast Proton Transport</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Side chain engineering of covalent organic frameworks as advanced ion conductors is a critical issue to be explored. Herein, ionic covalent organic framework membranes (iCOFMs) with spacer&#8208;engineered ionic channel were de novo designed and prepared. The ionic channels were decorated with side chains comprising of spacers having different carbon chain lengths and the &#8208;SO3H groups at the end. Attributed to the synergistic contribution from the spacers and the &#8208;SO3H groups, the iCOFM with moderate&#8208;length spacer exhibited the highest through&#8208;plane proton conductivity of 889 mS cm&#8722;1 at 90&#160;&#176;C.

         <title>Dynamically Tunable Optical Cavities with Embedded Nematic Liquid Crystalline Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Tunable metal&#8208;insulator&#8208;metal (MIM) Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot cavities that can dynamically control light enable novel sensing, imaging, and display applications. However, the realization of dynamic cavities incorporating stimuli&#8208;responsive materials pose a significant engineering challenge. Current approaches rely on refractive index modulation and suffer from low dynamic tunability, high losses, limited spectral ranges and require liquid and hazardous materials for operation. To overcome these challenges, a new tuning mechanism employing reversible mechanical adaptations of a polymer network is proposed and dynamic tuning of optical resonances is demonstrated. Solid&#8208;state temperature&#8208;responsive optical coatings are developed by preparing a monodomain nematic liquid crystalline network (LCN) and are incorporated between metallic mirrors to form active optical microcavities. LCN microcavities offer large, reversible and highly linear spectral tuning of Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot resonances reaching wavelength&#8208;shifts up to 40&#160;nm via thermo&#8208;mechanical actuation while featuring outstanding repeatability and precision over more than 100 heating&#8208;cooling cycles. This degree of tunability allows for reversible switching between the reflective and the absorbing states of the device over the entire visible and near&#8208;infrared spectral regions, reaching large changes in reflectance with modulation efficiency &#916;R = 79%.

         <title>Optically Tunable Transient Plasmons in InSb Nanowires</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Optical carrier incubation can effectively alter the electron transport properties of semiconductors; thus, optical switching of the plasmonic response of the semiconductor enables the ultrafast manipulation of the light at the nanoscale. Semiconductor nanostructures are promising platforms in on&#8208;chip high&#8208;speed plasmonic devices, owing to their high photoinduced electron injection efficiency at sub&#8208;picosecond and compatibility with contemporary semiconductor technologies. The pure single&#8208;crystalline InSb nanowires are promising plasmonic materials in the mid&#8208;infrared region due to their high electron mobility and small electron effective mass. Here, we utilize the pump&#8208;probe nanoscopy to investigate the pump fluence dependency and the dynamics of the non&#8208;equilibrium plasmons in the InSb nanowires. We successfully switch the InSb plasmon by injecting the photo&#8208;induced electrons and show the practical tuning of the plasmon frequency to one octave by increasing the pump fluence from 0 to 90 &#956;J/cm2. The density of the photo&#8208;induced electrons in InSb nanowires is 18.8&#215;1018 cm&#8722;3 with pump fluence as low as 90 &#956;J/cm2. The high electron mobility of the InSb supports the low&#8208;loss plasmon with a damping rate of about 200 cm&#8722;1. The InSb nanowires' excellent plasmonic properties ensure they are a promising platform for upcoming high&#8208;speed mid&#8208;infrared plasmonic materials for informatic devices.

         <title>Synergistic Surface Modification of Tin&#8211;Lead Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergistic surface modification of mixed Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite films by the combination of piperazine and C60 pyrrolidine tris&#8208;acid realizes narrow&#8208;bandgap solar cells with power conversion efficiencies up to 22.7% and substantially elongated stability.








Abstract
Interfaces in thin&#8208;film photovoltaics play a pivotal role in determining device efficiency and longevity. In this work, the top surface treatment of mixed tin&#8211;lead (&#8776;1.26&#160;eV) halide perovskite films for p&#8211;i&#8211;n solar cells is studied. Charge extraction is promoted by treating the perovskite surface with piperazine. This compound reacts with the organic cations at the perovskite surface, modifying the surface structure and tuning the interfacial energy level alignment. In addition, the combined treatment with C60 pyrrolidine tris&#8208;acid (CPTA) reduces hysteresis and leads to efficiencies up to 22.7%, with open&#8208;circuit voltage values reaching 0.90&#160;V, &#8776;92% of the radiative limit for the bandgap of this material. The modified cells also show superior stability, with unencapsulated cells retaining 96% of their initial efficiency after &gt;2000 h of storage in N2 and encapsulated cells retaining 90% efficiency after &gt;450 h of storage in air. Intriguingly, CPTA preferentially binds to Sn2+ sites at film surface over Pb2+ due to the energetically favored exposure of the former, according to first&#8208;principles calculations. This work provides new insights into the surface chemistry of perovskite films in terms of their structural, electronic, and defect characteristics and this knowledge is used to fabricate state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art solar cells.

         <title>Terahertz Nonlinear Hall Rectifiers Based on Spin&#8208;Polarized Topological Electronic States in&#160;1T&#8208;CoTe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A second&#8208;order nonlinear Hall effect response for high&#8208;efficiency terahertz rectification, is observed in the spin&#8208;polarized 1T&#8208;CoTe2, led by the zero&#8208;magnetic&#8208;field&#160;extrinsic contribution of topological electronic states. The Hall&#8208;rectifier, without invoking any semiconductor junctions or bias voltage, shows up room&#8208;temperature responsivity of over 0.1 A W&#8722;1, and a mean noise equivalent power of 1 pW Hz&#8722;1/2, opening up device implementation based on quantum&#8208;wavefunction engineering.








Abstract
The zero&#8208;magnetic&#8208;field nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE) refers to the second&#8208;order transverse current induced by an applied alternating electric field; it indicates the topological properties of inversion&#8208;symmetry&#8208;breaking crystals. Despite several studies on the NLHE induced by the Berry&#8208;curvature dipole in Weyl semimetals, the direct current conversion by rectification is limited to very low driving frequencies and cryogenic temperatures. The nonlinear photoresponse generated by the NLHE at room temperature can be useful for numerous applications in communication, sensing, and photodetection across a high bandwidth. In this study, observations of the second&#8208;order NLHE in type&#8208;II Dirac semimetal CoTe2 under time&#8208;reversal symmetry are reported. This is determined by the disorder&#8208;induced extrinsic contribution on the broken&#8208;inversion&#8208;symmetry surface and room&#8208;temperature terahertz rectification without the need for semiconductor junctions or bias voltage. It is shown that remarkable photoresponsivity over 0.1 A W&#8722;1, a response time of approximately 710&#160;ns, and a mean noise equivalent power of 1 pW Hz&#8722;1/2 can be achieved at room temperature. The results open a new pathway for low&#8208;energy photon harvesting via nonlinear rectification induced by the NLHE in strongly spin&#8211;orbit&#8208;coupled and inversion&#8208;symmetry&#8208;breaking systems, promising a considerable impact in the field of infrared/terahertz photonics.

In situ absorption measurement is used to investigate the aggregation behavior of acceptors during slot&#8208;die&#8208;coating. The 1 cm2 flexible device can reach a power conversion efficiency of 13.70%, with excellent shelf stability and upscaling ability. The connected modules (180 cm2) can effectively power a smartphone, showing great potential for future applications.








Abstract
Slot&#8208;die coating is recognized as the most compatible method for the roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll (R2R) processing of large&#8208;area flexible organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the photovoltaic performance of large&#8208;area flexible OSC lags significantly behind that of traditional spin&#8208;coating devices. In this work, two acceptors, Qx&#8208;1 and Qx&#8208;2, show quite different film&#8208;formation kinetics in the slot&#8208;die coating process. In situ absorption spectroscopy indicates that the excessive crystallinity of Qx&#8208;2 provides early phase separation and early aggregation, resulting in oversized crystal domains. Consequently, the PM6:Qx&#8208;1&#8208;based 1&#160;cm2 flexible device exhibits an excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.70%, which is the best performance among the slot&#8208;die&#8208;coated flexible devices; in contrast, the PM6:Qx&#8208;2 blend shows a pretty poor efficiency, which is lower than 1%. Moreover, the 30 cm2 modules based on PM6:Qx&#8208;1, containing six 5 cm2 sub&#8208;cells, exhibit a PCE of 12.20%. After being stored in a glove box for over 6000&#160;h, the PCE remains at 103% of its initial values, indicating excellent shelf stability. Therefore, these results show a promising future strategy for the upscaling fabrication of flexible large&#8208;area OSCs.

         <title>Modular Approach to Creating Functionalized Surface Arrays of Molecular Qubits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method to create 2D arrays of molecular spin qubits is reported. The quantum properties are retained and the quantum coherence times are improved compared to bulk conditions.








Abstract
The quest for developing quantum technologies is driven by the promise of exponentially faster computations, ultrahigh performance sensing, and achieving thorough understanding of many&#8208;particle quantum systems. Molecular spins are excellent qubit candidates because they feature long coherence times, are widely tunable through chemical synthesis, and can be interfaced with other quantum platforms such as superconducting qubits. A present challenge for molecular spin qubits is their integration in quantum devices, which requires arranging them in thin films or monolayers on surfaces. However, clear proof of the survival of quantum properties of molecular qubits on surfaces has not been reported so far. Furthermore, little is known about the change in spin dynamics of molecular qubits going from the bulk to monolayers. Here, a versatile bottom&#8208;up method is reported to arrange molecular qubits as functional groups of self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) on surfaces, combining molecular self&#8208;organization and click chemistry. Coherence times of up to 13 &#181;s demonstrate that qubit properties are maintained or even enhanced in the monolayer.

         <title>Rational Design of Platinum&#8211;Bismuth Sulfide Schottky Heterostructure for Sonocatalysis&#8208;Mediated Hydrogen Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of sonocatalytic hydrogen evolution is first proposed. The synthesized platinum&#8211;bismuth sulfide&#160;nanoparticles exhibit ultrasound&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen production, glutathione oxidation, relieve hypoxia in vitro and in vivo, and effectively kill cancer cells by inhibiting cancer cell energy metabolism, increasing intratumoral reactive oxygen species levels, and inducing DNA damage.








Abstract
Conventional sonodynamic therapy is unavoidably limited by the tumor microenvironment, although many sonosensitizers have been developed to improve them to a certain extent. Given this, a concept of sonocatalytic hydrogen evolution is proposed, which is defined as an oxygen&#8208;independent therapeutics. To demonstrate the feasibility of the concept, the narrow&#8208;bandgap semiconductor bismuth sulfide (Bi2S3) is selected as the sonocatalyst and platinum (Pt) nanoparticles are grown in situ to optimize their catalytic performance. In this nanocatalytic system, the Pt nanoparticles help to capture sonoexcited electrons, whereas intratumoral overexpressed glutathione (GSH), as a natural hole sacrificial agent, can consume sonoexcited holes, which greatly improves the charge&#8208;separation efficiency and promotes controllable and sustainable H2&#160;generation. Even under hypoxic conditions, the Pt&#8208;Bi2S3&#160;nanoparticles can also produce sufficient H2&#160;under ultrasound irradiation. Mechanistically, mitochondrial dysfunction caused by H2&#160;and intratumoral redox homeostasis destruction by GSH depletion synergistically damage DNA to induce tumor cells apoptosis. At the same time, the Pt nanoparticles and holes can also trigger the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into O2&#160;to relieve tumor hypoxia,&#160;thus&#160;being synergistic with GSH depletion to reverse tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment. The proposed sonocatalysis&#8208;mediated therapy will provide a new direction to realize facile and efficient cancer therapy.

         <title>Combined Vacuum Evaporation and Solution Process for High Efficiency Large&#8208;Area Perovskite Solar Cells with Exceptional Reproducibility</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Organic inorganic hybrid perovskites have exhibited outstanding performances in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the complex solution chemistry of perovskites precursors renders it difficult to prepare large&#8208;area devices in a reproducible way, which is a prerequisite for the technology to make an impact beyond lab scale. Vacuum processing, instead, is an established technology for large&#8208;scale coating of thin films. However, with respect to the hybrid perovskites it is highly challenging due to the high vapor pressure of the organic ammonium halide. In this work, we combine vacuum evaporation of lead iodide and solution processing of organic ammonium halide to produce large&#8208;area homogeneous perovskite films with large grains in a highly reproducible way. The resulting PSCs achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.3% (certified 23.9%) on small area (0.10 cm2), 24.0% (certified 23.7%) on large area (1 cm2) and 20.0% for minimodule (16 cm2), and maintained 90% of its initial efficiency after 1000 hours 1&#8208;sun operation. The vacuum evaporation prevents advert environmental effects on lead halide formation, guarantees a reproducible fabrication of high&#8208;quality large&#8208;area perovskite films, which opens a promising way for large scale fabrication of perovskite optoelectronics.

         <title>Reshaping the Endogenous Electric Field to Boost Wound Repair via Electrogenerative Dressing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The endogenous electric field (EF) generated by transepithelial potential difference plays a decisive role in wound re&#8208;epithelialization. For patients with large or chronic wounds, negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is the most effective clinical method in inflammation control by continuously removing the necrotic tissues or infected substances, thus creating a pro&#8208;proliferative microenvironment beneficial for wound re&#8208;epithelialization. However, continuous negative pressure drainage causes electrolyte loss and weakens the endogenous EF, which in turn hinders wound re&#8208;epithelialization. Here, we developed an electrogenerative dressing (EGD) by integrating triboelectric nanogenerators with NPWT. By converting the negative pressure&#8208;induced mechanical deformation into electricity, EGD produced a stable and high&#8208;safety EF that could trigger a robust epithelial electrotactic response and drive the macrophages toward a reparative M2 phenotype in vitro. Translational medicine studies confirmed that EGD completely reshaped the wound EF weakened by NPWT, and promoted wound closure by facilitating an earlier transition of inflammation/proliferation and guiding epithelial migration and proliferation to accelerate re&#8208;epithelialization. Long&#8208;term EGD therapy remarkably advanced tissue remodeling with mature epithelium, orderly extracellular matrix and less scar formation. Compared with the golden standard of NPWT, EGD orchestrated all the essential wound stages in a non&#8208;invasive manner, presenting an excellent prospect in clinical wound therapy.

Abstract
(Living creatures possess complex geometries, exceptional adaptability, and continuous growing and regenerating characteristics, which are difficult for synthetic materials to imitate simultaneously. We report a living polymer network with these features. The polymer can be digitally printed into arbitrary 3D shapes and subsequently undergo growth via living polymerization of a monomer as the nutrient. This leads to macroscopic dimensional growth and transforms the printed amorphous network into a crystallizable network, resulting in geometric adaptability via a shape memory mechanism. By controlling the localized growth, an initial homogeneous structure can be converted into a geometrically different heterogeneous structure composed of materials with different properties (crystallization and mechanical properties). After growth, the original network can be chemically regenerated for regrowth. With this regenerative living 4D printing, one 3D printed seed template can be turned into different derivatives with distinct geometries and mechanical properties when repeated regeneration is conducted in different localized regions and the degree of regrowth is varied).

         <title>Arrested Phase Separation Enables High&#8208;Performance Keratoprosthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Corneal transplantation is impeded by donor shortages, immune rejection, and ethical reservations. Pre&#8208;made cornea prosthesis (keratoprosthesis) offers a proven option to alleviate these issues. Ideal keratoprosthesis must possess optical clarity and mechanical robustness, but also high permeability, processability and recyclability. Here we show that rationally controlling the extent of arrested phase separation can lead to optimized multiscale structure that reconcile permeability and transparency, a previously conflicting goal by common pore&#8208;forming strategies. The process is simply accomplished by hydrothermally treating a dense and transparent hydrophobic association hydrogel. The examination of multi&#8208;scale structure evolution during hydrothermal treatment reveals that the phase separation with upper miscibility gap evolves to confer time&#8208;dependent pore growth due to slow dynamics of polymer&#8208;rich phase which is close to vitrification. Such a process can render a combination of multiple desired properties that equal or surpass those of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art keratoprosthesis. In vivo tests confirm that our keratoprosthesis can effectively repair corneal perforation and restore a transparent cornea with treatment outcomes akin to that of allo&#8208;keratoplasty. Our keratoprosthesis is easy to access and convenient to carry, thus it would be an effective temporary substitute for a corneal allograft in emergency condition.

         <title>Pt Quantum Dots Modified S&#8208;NiFe Layered Double Hydroxide for High&#8208;Current&#8208;Density Alkaline Water Splitting at Industrial Temperature</title>

Abstract
Suitable electrocatalysts for industrial water splitting can veritably promote practical hydrogen applications. Rational surface design is exceptionally significant for electrocatalysts to bridge the gap between fundamental science and industrial expectation in water splitting. Here, we designed Pt quantum dots (Pt QDs) modified sulfur&#8208;doped NiFe layered double hydroxides (Pt@S&#8208;NiFe LDHs) with eximious catalytic activity toward hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) under industrial&#160;condition. Benefiting from enhanced binding energy, mass transfer and hydrogen release, Pt@S&#8208;NiFe LDHs exhibit outstanding activity in HER at high current densities. Notably, it obtains an impressively low overpotential of 71&#160;mV and long&#8208;term stability of 200&#160;h at 100&#8239;mA&#8239;cm&#8722;2, exceeding commercial 40% Pt/C and most reported Pt&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Its mass activity is 2.7 times higher than that of 40% Pt/C with an overpotential of 100&#160;mV. Furthermore, at industrial temperature (65 &#176;C), the electrolyzer based on Pt@S&#8208;NiFe LDH needs just 1.62&#160;V to reach the current density of 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, superior to that of the commercial one of 40% Pt/C//IrO2. This work provides rational ideas to develop electrocatalysts with exceptional performance for industrial high&#8208;temperature water splitting at high current densities.

         <title>Unsaturated, Trialkyl Ionizable Lipids are Versatile LNP Components for Therapeutic and Vaccine Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Lipid nanoparticles (LNP) have proven a successful platform for the delivery of nucleic acid (NA) based therapeutics and vaccines, with the ionizable lipid component playing a key role in modulating potency and tolerability. Here, we screened a library of 16 novel ionizable lipids hypothesizing that short, branched trialkyl hydrophobic domains would improve LNP fusogenicity or endosomal escape, and potency. LNPs formulated with the top&#8208;performing trialkyl lipid (Lipid 10) encapsulating transthyretin siRNA elicited significantly greater gene silencing and were better tolerated than those with the benchmark Onpattro&#174; lipid DLin&#8208;MC3&#8208;DMA. Lipid 10 also demonstrated superior liver delivery of mRNA when compared to other literature ionizable lipids, was well tolerated, and successfully repeat dosed in non&#8208;human primates. In a prime&#8208;boost hemagglutinin (HA) rodent vaccine model, intramuscular administration of Lipid&#8208;10 LNP elicited comparable or better antibody titers to the SM&#8208;102 and ALC&#8208;0315 lipid compositions used in the FDA&#8208;approved mRNA COVID vaccines. Our data suggest that Lipid 10 is a particularly versatile ionizable lipid, well&#8208;suited for both systemic therapeutic and intramuscular vaccine applications and able to successfully deliver diverse NA payloads.

         <title>Plasmonic Dual&#8208;Gap Nanodumbbells for Label&#8208;Free On&#8208;Particle Raman DNA Assays</title>

Abstract
Metal nanostructures with a tunable plasmonic gap are useful for photonics, surface&#8208;enhanced spectroscopy, biosensing and bioimaging applications. The use of these structures as chemical and biological sensing/imaging probes typically requires an ultra&#8208;precise synthesis of the targeted nanostructure in a high yield, Raman dye&#8208;labeling and complex assay components and procedures. Here, we designed and synthesized a plasmonic nanostructure with tunable dual nanogaps, Au dual&#8208;gap nanodumbbells (AuDGNs), via the anisotropic adsorption of polyethyleneimine on Au nanorods to facilitate tip&#8208;selective Au growths on nanorod tips for forming mushroom&#8208;shaped dumbbell&#8208;head structures at both tips and result in dual gaps (intra&#8208;head and inter&#8208;head gaps) within a single particle. AuDGNs were synthesized in a high yield (&gt;90%) while controlling the inter&#8208;head gap size, and the average surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) enhancement factor (EF) value is 7.5&#215;108 with a very narrow EF distribution from 1.5&#215;108 to 1.5&#215;109 for &gt;90% of analyzed particles. Importantly, AuDGNs enabled label&#8208;free on&#8208;particle SERS detection assays through the diffusion of target molecules into the intraparticle dumbbell gap for different DNA sequences with varying ATGC combinations in a highly specific and sensitive manner without a need for Raman dyes.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Zn&#8208;N5 Sites immobilized on g&#8208;C3N4 Nanosheets for Ultrasensitive Selective Detection of Phenanthrene by Dual Ratiometric Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Ultrasensitively selective detection of trace polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) like phenanthrene (PHE) is critical but remains challenging. Herein, for the first time, atomically&#8208;dispersed Zn sites on g&#8208;C3N4 nanosheets (sZn&#8208;CN) are constructed by thermal polymerization of Zn&#8208;cyanuric acid&#8208;melamine supramolecular precursor for the fluorescence detection of PHE. The high&#8208;amount (1.6 wt%) sZn is grafted in the cave of CN with one N vacancy in the form of unique Zn(II)&#8208;N5 coordination. The optimized sZn&#8208;CN achieves a wide detection range (1 ng&#183;L&#8722;1 &#8764; 5 mg&#183;L&#8722;1), ultralow detection limit (0.35 ng&#183;L&#8722;1, with 5&#8208;order magnitude improvement over CN), and ultrahigh selectivity towards PHE even among typical PAHs based on the built PHE&#8208;CN dual ratiometric fluorescence method. By means of the in&#8208;situ Fourier transform infrared spectra, time&#8208;resolved absorption and fluorescence spectra, and theoretical calculation, the resulting superior detection performance is attributed to the favorable selective adsorption of PHE on as&#8208;constructed atomic Zn(II)&#8208;N5 sites via the ionic cation&#8208;&#960; interactions (Zn&#948;+&#8211;C2&#948;&#8208; type), and the fluorescence quenching is dominated by the inner filter effect (IFE) from the multilayer adsorption of PHE at low concentrations, while it is done by the protruded photogenerated electron transfer (PET) process as well as IFE from the monolayer adsorption of PHE at ultralow concentration.

         <title>Electrically Driven Sub&#8208;Micron Light&#8208;Emitting Diode Arrays Using Maskless and Etching&#8208;Free Pixelation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
For the decades, group III&#8208;nitride&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) are regarded as a light emitting source for future displays in virtue of their novel properties such as high efficiency, brightness and stability. Nevertheless, realization of high pixel density displays is still challenging due to limitations on pixelation methods. In this study, a maskless and etching&#8208;free micro&#8208;LEDs (&#956;LEDs) pixelation method is developed via tailored He focused ion beam (FIB) irradiation technique, and electrically&#8208;driven sub&#8208;micrometer&#8208;scale &#956;LED pixel arrays are demonstrated. It is confirmed that optical quenching and electrical isolation effects are simultaneously induced at a certain ion dose (&#8764;1014 ions/cm2) without surface damage. Furthermore, highly efficient &#956;LED pixel arrays at sub&#8208;micrometer&#8208;scale (square pixel, 0.5&#160;&#956;m side length) are fabricated. Their pixelation and brightness are verified by various optical measurements such as cathodo&#8208;, photo&#8208; and electro&#8208;luminescence. We expect that the FIB&#8208;induced optical quenching and electrical isolation method can pioneer a new defect engineering technology not only for &#956;LED fabrication, but also for sub&#8208;micron&#8208;scale optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Rapid Data&#8208;Efficient Optimization of Perovskite Nanocrystal Syntheses through Machine Learning Algorithm Fusion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
With the demand for renewable energy and efficient devices rapidly increasing, a need arises to find and optimize novel (nano)materials. With sheer limitless possibilities for material combinations and synthetic procedures, obtaining novel, highly functional materials has been a tedious trial and error process. Recently, machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool to help optimize syntheses; however, most approaches require a substantial amount of input data, limiting their pertinence. Here, we&#160;merge three well&#8208;known machine&#8208;learning models with Bayesian Optimization into one to optimize the synthesis of CsPbBr3 nanoplatelets with limited data demand. The algorithm can accurately predict the photoluminescence emission maxima of nanoplatelet dispersions using only the three precursor ratios as input parameters. This allowed us to fabricate previously unobtainable 7 and 8 monolayer&#8208;thick nanoplatelets. Moreover, the algorithm dramatically improved the homogeneity of 2&#8208;6 monolayer&#8208;thick nanoplatelet dispersions, as evidenced by narrower and more symmetric photoluminescence spectra. Decisively, only 200 total syntheses were&#160;required to achieve this vast improvement, highlighting how rapidly material properties can be optimized. The algorithm is highly versatile and can incorporate additional synthetic parameters. Accordingly, it is readily applicable to other less&#8208;explored nanocrystal syntheses and can help rapidly identify and improve exciting compositions'&#160;quality.

         <title>Bistable Joints Enable Morphing of Hydrogel Sheets with Multi&#8208;Stable Configurations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Joints, as a flexing element to connect different parts, are widespread in natural systems. Various joints exist in our bodies and play crucial roles to execute gestures and gaits. These scenarios have inspired us to design mechanical joints with passive, hard materials, which usually need an external power supply to drive the transformations. Incorporation of soft and active joints provides a modular strategy to devise soft actuators and robots. However, transformations of responsive joints under external stimuli are usually in uni&#8208;mode with pre&#8208;determined direction. Reported here are hydrogel joints capable of folding and twisting transformation in bi&#8208;mode, enabling the composite hydrogel to form multiple configurations under constant condition. These joints have an in&#8208;plane gradient structure and comprise stiff, passive gel as the frame and soft, active gel as the actuating unit. Under external stimuli, the response mismatch between different gels leads to out&#8208;of&#8208;plane folding or twisting deformation with the feature of bistability. These joints can be modular integrated with other gels to afford complex deformations and multi&#8208;stable configurations. This approach favors selective control of hydrogel's architectures and versatile design of hydrogel devices, as demonstrated by proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept examples. It should also merit the development of metamaterials, soft actuators and robots, etc.

         <title>In Situ Generation of Red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR Emissive Radical Cations in Stomach for Gastrointestinal Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR fluorescent probes with the advantages such as high spatiotemporal resolution and in situ sensing abilities are highly attractive for gastrointestinal disease diagnosis and targeted drug development. However, conventional red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR fluorophores with electron closed&#8208;shell structures require tedious synthetic procedures for preparation, and it is difficult to further decorate them with sensing groups. In this study, we developed a series of easily prepared pyrroles with simple structures that can quickly be transformed into red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR emissive radical cations in acidic buffer solution and in vivo stomachs. The in situ generated red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR emissive pyrrole radical cations in stomach have excellent biocompatibility and stability and can be used not only for intravital gastrointestinal imaging with high spatiotemporal resolution, but also for dynamic monitoring of the gastric emptying process and assessment of anti&#8208;gastric acid therapy. We believe the acidity&#8208;induced generation of pyrrole radical cations provides a facile strategy for developing red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR fluorophores and studying gastrointestinal diseases.

         <title>A Super Tough, Rapidly Biodegradable, Ultrafast Hemostatic Bioglue</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new bioglue is composed of amidated&#8208;gelatin and Tetra&#8208;PEG&#8208;SS for rapid hemostasis in massive hemorrhage. The amino terminals in gelatin quickly react with active ester moieties in the PEG&#8208;SS, endowing the amino&#8208;gelatin&#8208;PEG glue firm and indiscriminate adhesion with various moist tissues (e.g., adhesively sealing cardiac hemorrhagic wounds). The bioglue provides a fascinating hemostatic approach for clinical hemostasis and emergency rescue.








Abstract
Death happening due to massive hemorrhage has been involved in military conflicts, traffic accidents, and surgical injuries of various human disasters. Achieving rapid and effective hemostasis to save lives is crucial in urgent massive bleeding situations. Herein, a covalent cross&#8208;linked AG&#8208;PEG glue based on extracellular matrix&#8208;like amino&#8208;gelatin (AG) and PEG derivatives is developed. The AG&#8208;PEG glue gelatinizes fast and exhibits firm and indiscriminate close adhesion with various moist tissues upon being dosed. The formed glue establishes an adhesive and robust barrier to seal the arterial, hepatic, and cardiac hemorrhagic wounds, enabling it to withstand up to 380&#160;mmHg blood pressure in comparison with normal systolic blood pressure of 60&#8211;180&#160;mmHg. Remarkably, massive bleeding from a pig cardiac penetrating hole with 6&#160;mm diameter is effectively stopped using the glue within 60&#160;s. Postoperative indexes of the treated pig gradually recover and the cardiac wounds regrow significantly at 14&#160;days. Possessing on&#8208;demand solubility, self&#8208;gelling, and rapid degradability, the AG&#8208;PEG glue may provide a fascinating stop&#8208;bleeding approach for clinical hemostasis and emergency rescue.

A highly efficient and cost&#8208;effective imaging&#8208;guided/&#8208;assessed H2&#8208;therapy of tumors based on a joint electrochemo&#8208;sonodynamic treatment (H2&#8208;EC/SD co&#8208;therapy) is developed. The endogenic H2&#8208;triggered &#8220;domino effect&#8221; in tumor tissue is clearly revealed. The developed H2&#8208;EC/SD co&#8208;therapy guided by US imaging in vivo will open up a feasible new way for green, economic, and effective treatment of cancer in the future.








Abstract
Precise and on&#8208;demand release of sufficient hydrogen (H2) to tumor sites remains a key challenge for emerging H2&#8208;oncotherapy, and little is known about the physiological effects of &#8220;abundant&#8221; H2 on complex tumor microenvironments (TME). Here, a highly efficient and cost&#8208;effective imaging&#8208;guided/&#8208;assessed H2&#8208;therapy of tumors based on a joint electrochemo&#8208;sonodynamic treatment (H2&#8208;EC/SD co&#8208;therapy) with strong &#8220;domino effect&#8221; triggered by endogenous H2 generation at tumor sites is reported to speedily eliminate tumor tissue (&#8804;80&#160;mm3) within 1&#160;day. Adequate H2 is controllably generated in tumor sites through mild electrochemistry in vivo due to acidic TME by using clinical acupuncture Fe needles as electrodes. Besides starvation damage due to gas blockage/destruction of vessels, nano&#8208;/micro&#8208;bubbles of H2 formed in situ can elevate the tumor's internal temperature and burst vessels to further destroy the tumor&#160;under ultrasound irradiation. Remarkably, vulnerable homeostasis of TME is disturbed as H2 also participates in the physiological activity of tumor cells, leading to tumor dysfunction. Last but not least, the body's inflammatory response to cancer is reduced after the treatment, which is beneficial for the body's immune system during post&#8208;treatment recovery. Based on all of these merits, the H2&#8208;EC/SD co&#8208;therapy provides a potentially safe and viable therapeutic strategy for future clinical applications.

         <title>Highly Damping and Self&#8208;Healable Ionic Elastomer from Dynamic Phase Separation of Sticky Fluorinated Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the heterogeneous structure of adipose tissue, the first example of damping self&#8208;healable ionic elastomer is reported, which features a dynamic phase&#8208;separated structure with energy&#8208;dissipating nanophases embedded in an elastic matrix. By virtue of phase separation and sticky liquid crystal assembly of fluorinated copolymers, this design reconciles elasticity and damping capacity, which are usually contradictive in previous ionic skins.








Abstract
Shock&#8208;induced low&#8208;frequency vibration damage is extremely harmful to bionic soft robots and machines that may incur the malfunction of fragile electronic elements. However, current skin&#8208;like self&#8208;healable ionic elastomers as the artificial sensing and protecting layer still lack the ability to dampen vibrations, due to their almost opposite design for molecular frictions to material's elasticity. Inspired by the two&#8208;phase structure of adipose tissue (the natural damping skin layer), here, a highly damping ionic elastomer with energy&#8208;dissipating nanophases embedded in an elastic matrix is introduced, which is formed by polymerization&#8208;induced dynamic phase separation of sticky fluorinated copolymers in the presence of lithium salts. Such a supramolecular design decouples the elastic and damping functions into two distinct phases, and thus reconciles a few intriguing properties including ionic conductivity, high stretchability, softness, strain&#8208;stiffening, elastic recovery, room&#8208;temperature self&#8208;healability, recyclability, and most importantly, record&#8208;high damping capacity at the human motion frequency range (loss factor tan &#948;&#160;&gt;&#160;1 at 0.1&#8211;50&#160;Hz). This study opens the door for the artificial syntheses of high&#8208;performance damping ionic skins with robust sensing and protective applications in soft electronics and robotics.

         <title>A Breathable, Passive&#8208;Cooling, Non&#8208;Inflammatory, and Biodegradable Aerogel Electronic Skin for Wearable Physical&#8208;Electrophysiological&#8208;Chemical Analysis</title>

         <dc:description>
A breathable, passive&#8208;cooling, non&#8208;inflammatory, biodegradable, and flexible aerogel electronic skin is developed to monitor physical, electrophysiological, and metabolic biomarkers from the human body continuously and simultaneously.








Abstract
Real&#8208;time monitoring of human health can be significantly improved by designing novel electronic skin (E&#8208;skin) platforms that mimic the characteristics and sensitivity of human skin. A high&#8208;quality E&#8208;skin platform that can simultaneously monitor multiple physiological and metabolic biomarkers without introducing skin discomfort or irritation is an unmet medical need. Conventional E&#8208;skins are either monofunctional or made from elastomeric films that do not include key synergistic features of natural skin, such as multi&#8208;sensing, breathability, and thermal management capabilities in a single patch. Herein, a biocompatible and biodegradable E&#8208;skin patch based on flexible gelatin methacryloyl aerogel (FGA) for non&#8208;invasive and continuous monitoring of multiple biomarkers of interest is engineered and demonstrated. Taking advantage of cryogenic temperature treatment and slow polymerization, FGA is fabricated with a highly interconnected porous structure that displays good flexibility, passive&#8208;cooling capabilities, and ultra&#8208;lightweight properties that make it comfortable to wear for long periods of time. It also provides numerous permeable capillary channels for thermal&#8208;moisture transfer, ensuring its excellent breathability. Therefore, the engineered FGA&#8208;based E&#8208;skin can simultaneously monitor body temperature, hydration, and biopotentials via electrophysiological sensors and detect glucose, lactate, and alcohol levels via electrochemical sensors. This work offers a previously unexplored materials strategy for next&#8208;generation E&#8208;skin platforms with superior practicality.

         <title>Hydrogel with Robust Adhesion in Various Liquid Environments by Electrostatic Induced Hydrophilic and Hydrophobic Polymer Chains Migration and Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Hydrogels with wet adhesion are promising interfacial adhesive materials; however, their adhesion in water, oil, or organic solvents remains a major challenge. To address this, we fabricated a pressure&#8208;sensitive P(AAm&#8208;co&#8208;C18)/PTA&#8208;Fe hydrogel, which exhibited robust adhesion to various substrates in both aqueous solutions and oil environments. We demonstrated that the key to wet adhesion under liquid conditions is the removal of the interfacial liquid, which can be achieved through rational molecular composition regulation. By complexing with hydrophilic polymer networks, phosphotungstic acid (PTA) was introduced into the hydrogel network as a physical crosslinker and anchor point to improve the cohesion strength and drive the migration of polymer chains. The migration and rearrangement of hydrophilic and hydrophobic polymer chains on hydrogel surface were induced by the electrostatic interactions of Fe3+, which created a surface with interfacial water&#8208; and oil&#8208;removing properties. By co&#8208;regulating the hydrophilic and hydrophobic polymer chains, the P(AAm&#8208;co&#8208;C18)/PTA&#8208;Fe hydrogel was able to act as a pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesive (PSA) under water and oils with adhesion strength of 92.6 and 90.0 kPa, respectively. We anticipate that this regulation strategy for polymer chains will promote the development of wet adhesion hydrogels, which could have a wide range of applications.

         <title>Dramatically Accelerated Formation of Graphite Intercalation Compounds Catalyzed by Sodium</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Graphite intercalation compounds (GICs) have a variety of functions due to their rich material variations, and thus, innovative methods for their synthesis are desired for practical applications. We have discovered that Na has a catalytic property that dramatically accelerates the formation of GICs. We demonstrate that LiC6n (n = 1, 2), KC8, KC12n (n = 2, 3, 4), and NaCx are synthesized simply by mixing alkali metals and graphite powder with Na at room temperature (&#8764;25&#176;C), and AEC6 (AE = Ca, Sr, Ba) are synthesized by heating Na&#8208;added reagents at 250&#176;C only for a few hours. The NaCx, formed by the mixing of C and Na, is understood to act as a reaction intermediate for a catalyst, thereby accelerating the formation of GICs by lowering the activation energy of intercalation. The Na&#8208;catalyzed method, which enables the rapid and mass synthesis of homogeneous GIC samples in a significantly simpler manner than conventional methods, is anticipated to stimulate research and development for GIC applications.

         <title>Scalable Manufacturing of Mechanical Robust Bio&#8208;Inspired Ceramic&#8208;Resin Composites with Locally Tunable Heterogeneous Structures</title>

Abstract
Light&#8208;weight structural materials with a unique combination of high stiffness, strength, toughness, and hardness, are highly&#8208;desired yet challenging to be artificially fabricated. Biological structural materials, on the other hand, ingeniously integrate multiple mutually exclusive mechanical properties together relying on their hierarchically heterogeneous structures bonded with gradient interfaces. Here, we report a scalable bottom&#8208;up approach combining continuous nanofiber&#8208;assisted evaporation&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly with laminating, pressure&#8208;less sintering and resin infiltration to fabricate bio&#8208;inspired heterogeneous ceramic&#8208;resin composites with locally&#8208;tunable microstructure to fulfill specific properties. A gradient interlayer was&#160; introduced to provide gradual transition between adjacent heterogeneous layers, effectively alleviating their property mismatch. The optimized heterogeneous nacre&#8208;like composite, as a demonstration, exhibit an attractive combination of low density (&#8764;2.8&#160;g cm&#8722;3), high strength (&#8764;292&#160;MPa), toughness (&#8764;6.4&#160;MPa m1/2), surface hardness (&#8764;1144 kgf mm&#8722;2) and impact&#8208;resistance, surpassing the overall performance of engineering alumina. This material&#8208;independent approach paves the way for designing advanced bio&#8208;inspired heterogeneous materials for diverse structural and functional applications.

&lt;p&gt;Light-weight structural materials with a unique combination of high stiffness, strength, toughness, and hardness, are highly-desired yet challenging to be artificially fabricated. Biological structural materials, on the other hand, ingeniously integrate multiple mutually exclusive mechanical properties together relying on their hierarchically heterogeneous structures bonded with gradient interfaces. Here, we report a scalable bottom-up approach combining continuous nanofiber-assisted evaporation-induced self-assembly with laminating, pressure-less sintering and resin infiltration to fabricate bio-inspired heterogeneous ceramic-resin composites with locally-tunable microstructure to fulfill specific properties. A gradient interlayer was&#160; introduced to provide gradual transition between adjacent heterogeneous layers, effectively alleviating their property mismatch. The optimized heterogeneous nacre-like composite, as a demonstration, exhibit an attractive combination of low density (&#8764;2.8&#160;g cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;), high strength (&#8764;292&#160;MPa), toughness (&#8764;6.4&#160;MPa m&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;), surface hardness (&#8764;1144 kgf mm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and impact-resistance, surpassing the overall performance of engineering alumina.

         <title>Extremely Robust and Multifunctional Nanocomposite Fibers for Strain&#8208;Unperturbed Textile Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Since textile electronics are generally worn on human bodies, they are inevitably stretched or compressed due to substantial deformations generated from human motions. Thus, textile electronics are needed that can achieve strain&#8208;unaltered performance when they undergo irregular and repeated strain deformation. Such strain&#8208;unaltered textile electronics require advanced fibers that simultaneously have high functionalities and extreme robustness as fabric materials. Current synthetic nanocomposite fibers based on inorganic matrix have remarkable functionalities but often suffer from low robustness and poor tolerance against crack formation; thus, they cannot endure large strain or cyclic strain loadings. Here, we present a design for a high&#8208;performance multifunctional nanocomposite fiber that is mechanically and electrically robust, which was realized by crosslinking titanium carbide (MXene) nanosheets with a slide&#8208;ring polyrotaxane to form an internal mechanically&#8208;interlocked network. This inorganic matrix nanocomposite fiber featured distinct strain&#8208;hardening mechanical behavior and exceptional load&#8208;bearing capability (toughness approaching 60&#160;MJ/m3 and ductility over 27%). It retained 100% of its ductility after cyclic strain loading. Moreover, the high electrical conductivity (&gt;1.1&#215;105 S/m) and electrochemical performance (&gt;360 F/cm3) of the nanocomposite fiber can be well retained after subjecting the fiber to extensive (&gt; 25% strain) and long&#8208;term repeated (10,000 cycles) dimensional changes. Such superior robustness allowed for the fabrication of the nanocomposite fibers into various robust wearable devices, such as textile&#8208;based electromechanical sensors with strain&#8208;unalterable sensing performance and fiber&#8208;shaped supercapacitors with invariant electrochemical performance for 10,000 strain loading cycles.

         <title>Interface Modulation of Metal Sulfide Anodes for Long&#8208;Cycle&#8208;Life Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Although studies of transition metal sulfides (TMS) as anode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries have been extensively reported, the short cycle life is still a thorny problem that impedes their practical application. In this work, we demonstrate a new capacity fading mechanism of the TMS electrodes; that is, the parasitic reaction between electrolyte anions (i.e., ClO4&#8722;) and metal sulfides yields non&#8208;conductive and unstable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) and meanwhile corrosively turns metal sulfides into less&#8208;active oxides. This knowledge guides the development of an electrochemical strategy to manipulate the anion decomposition and construct a stable interface that prevents extensive parasitic reactions. We show that introducing sodium nitrate to the electrolyte radically changes the Na+ solvation structure by populating nitrate ions in the first solvation sheath, generating a stable and conductive SEI layer containing both Na3N and NaF. The optimized interface enables an iron sulfide anode to stably cycle for over 2000 cycles with negligible capacity loss, and a similar enhancement in cycle performance is demonstrated on a number of other metal sulfides. This work discloses metal sulfides&#8217; cycling failure mechanism from a unique perspective and highlights the critical importance in manipulating the interface chemistry in sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Comprehensively Understanding the Role of Anion Vacancies on K&#8208;Ion Storage: A Case Study of Se Vacancy Engineered VSe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Anion vacancy engineering (AVE) has been widely used to improve the Li&#8208;ion and Na&#8208;ion storage of conversion&#8208;type anode materials. However, AVE is still an emerging strategy in K&#8208;ion batteries which is promising for large&#8208;scale energy storage. In addition, the role of anion vacancies on ion storage is far from clear, despite several proposed explanations. Herein, by employing VSe2 as a model conversion&#8208;type anode material, Se vacancies are intentionally introduced (labeled as P&#8208;VSe2&#8211;x) to investigate their effect on K+ storage. The P&#8208;VSe2&#8211;x shows excellent cyclability in half cells (143&#160;mA h g&#8211;1 at 3.0 A g&#8211;1 after 1000 cycles) and high energy density in coin&#8208;type full cells (206.8&#160;Wh kg&#8211;1). By applying various electrochemical techniques, we uncover the effects of Se vacancies on the redox potentials of K&#8208;ion insertion/extraction and the K&#8208;ion diffusions in electrodes upon cycling. In addition, we disclose the structural evolution of Se vacancies during potassiation/de&#8208;potassiation using various operando and ex&#8208;situ characterizations. Moreover, for the first time, we demonstrate that Se vacancies can facilitate the break of V&#8208;Se bonds upon the P&#8208;VSe2&#8211;x conversion using theoretical calculations. This work comprehensively explains the role of anion vacancies in ion storage for developing high&#8208;performance conversion&#8208;type anode materials.

         <title>Sunlight Stimulated Photochemical Self&#8208;Healing Polymers Capable of Re&#8208;bonding Damages up to a Centimeter Below the Surface Even Out of the Reach of the Illumination</title>

To break the bottlenecks in developing photochemical self&#8208;healing polymers
: (i) only the surface cracks can be restored and (ii) materials&#8217; mechanical properties are lower, we design crosslinked poly(urethane&#8208;dithiocarbamate)s carrying photo&#8208;reversible dithiocarbamate bonds covalently linked to indole chromophores and benzyl groups. The conjugated structure of the chromophore and benzyl enhances the addition reactivity of thiocarbonyl moiety and facilitates photo&#8208;cleavage of C&#8722;S bond, so that transfer of the created radicals among dithiocarbamate linkages is promoted. Accordingly, reshuffling of the reversibly crosslinked networks via dynamic exchange between the activated dithiocarbamates is enabled in both surface layer and the interior upon exposure to the low&#8208;intensity UV light from the sun. It is found that the damages up to a centimeter below the surface can be effectively recovered in the sunshine, which greatly exceeds the maximum penetration distance of UV light (hundreds of microns). Besides, tensile strength and failure strain of the poly(urethane&#8208;dithiocarbamate) are superior to the reported photo&#8208;reversible polymers, achieving the record&#8208;high 33.8&#160;MPa and 782.0% owing to the wide selectivity of soft/hard blocks, multiple interactions and appropriate crosslinking architecture. The present work provides a novel paradigm of photo self&#8208;healing polymers capable of re&#8208;bonding cracks even out of the reach of the illumination.

         <title>In&#8208;situ Synthesis of &#8208;P = N&#8208;doped Carbon Nanofibers for Single Atom Catalytic Hydrosilylation</title>

Abstract
Single atom catalyst becomes a popular choice in various catalysis applications, which takes advantages of both homogeneous catalysis (e.g., high efficiency) and heterogeneous catalysis (e.g., easy catalyst recovery). The atom support plays an indispensable role in anchoring atomic species and interplaying with them for ultimate catalytic performance. Therefore, development of new support materials for superior catalysis is of great importance. Here we reported the synthesis of carbon nanofibers based on the reaction between P2O5 and N&#8208;Methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyrrolidone. The underlying reaction process was systematically investigated by FTIR and NMR. The carbon nanofibers owned interesting &#8208;P = N&#8208; units in their chemical structure, which acts as the anchoring site for single atom catalyst. The Pt atoms anchoring carbon nanofibers exhibit high activity for hydrosilylation with a turnover frequency of 9.2&#215;106 h&#8722;1 and a selectivity &gt; 99%. This research affords not only a new in&#8208;situ chemical strategy to synthesize multiatom doped carbon nanofibers but also presents a potential superior support in catalysis, which opens a hopeful window in materials chemistry and catalysis applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Q Thin&#8208;Film Lithium Niobate Microrings Fabricated with Wet Etching</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 3, January 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wet etching method is developed for thin&#8208;film lithium niobate (TFLN), leading to the fabrication of a micro&#8208;racetrack with an intrinsic quality factor over 9 million. This method features a high throughput, a high reproducibility, and a low cost in etching TFLN, showing the potential to boost the mass production of integrated TFLN devices with high fidelity and affordability dramatically.








Abstract
Thin&#8208;film lithium niobate (TFLN) has been widely used in electro&#8208;optic modulators, acoustic&#8208;&#8211;optic modulators, electro&#8208;optic frequency combs, and nonlinear wavelength converters owing to the excellent optical properties of lithium niobate. The performance of these devices is highly dependent on the fabrication quality of TFLN. Although state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art TFLN microrings with an intrinsic quality factor (Q&#8208;factor) exceeding 1 &#215; 107 have been realized by inductively coupled plasma&#8211;reactive ion etching (ICP&#8208;RIE) and chemical mechanical polishing (CMP), ICP&#8208;RIE has moderate throughput, moderate reproducibility, and high cost in etching TFLN, while CMP features moderate throughput and low cost in etching TFLN. Here, a wet etching method for TFLN, leading to the fabrication of a micro&#8208;racetrack with an intrinsic Q&#8208;factor of over 9.27 &#215; 106 is developed. The suitability of this method to fabricate a narrow coupling gap between the bus waveguide and microring enables the coupling conditions of the microring to be customized. This method features a high throughput, a high reproducibility, and a low cost in etching TFLN, showing the potential to boost the mass production of integrated LN photonic devices with high fidelity and affordability&#160;dramatically.

         <title>Visualization of Tunable Weyl Line in A&#8211;A Stacking Kagome Magnets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 3, January 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work provides the spectroscopic evidence of 3D Weyl lines in Mn&#8208;based kagome magnets with the systematic angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiment. Interestingly, the bandgap and binding energies of the Weyl lines can be tuned through cation engineering, which demonstrate the system as a promising platform for realizing controllable and robust 3D quantum devices.








Abstract
Kagome magnets provide a fascinating platform for a plethora of topological quantum phenomena, in which the delicate interplay between frustrated crystal structure, magnetization, and spin&#8211;orbit coupling (SOC) can engender highly tunable topological states. Here, utilizing angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy, the Weyl lines are directly visualized with strong out&#8208;of&#8208;plane dispersion in the A&#8211;A stacked kagome magnet GdMn6Sn6. Remarkably, the Weyl lines exhibit a strong magnetization&#8208;direction&#8208;tunable SOC gap and binding energy tunability after substituting Gd with Tb and Li, respectively. These results not only illustrate the magnetization direction and valence counting as efficient tuning knobs for realizing and controlling distinct 3D topological phases, but also demonstrate AMn6Sn6 (A = rare earth, or Li, Mg, or Ca) as a versatile material family for exploring diverse emergent topological quantum responses.

         <title>3D&#8208;Bioprinted Phantom with Human Skin Phototypes for Biomedical Optics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 3, January 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Skin&#8208;mimicking phantoms with different Fitzpatrick scale values are reported to understand the impact of skin phototypes on biomedical optics. The absorption and scattering coefficients of the skin phantoms are similar to real human skin. This approach may have value in understanding differences in the performance of biomedical optics as a function of skin tone.








Abstract
3D&#8208;bioprinted skin&#8208;mimicking phantoms with skin colors ranging across the Fitzpatrick scale are reported. These tools can help understand the impact of skin phototypes on biomedical optics. Synthetic melanin nanoparticles of different sizes (70&#8211;500&#160;nm) and clusters are fabricated to mimic the optical behavior of melanosome. The absorption coefficient and reduced scattering coefficient of the phantoms are comparable to real human skin. Further the melanin content and distribution in the phantoms versus real human skins are validated via photoacoustic (PA) imaging. The PA signal of the phantom can be improved by: 1) increasing melanin size (3&#8211;450&#8208;fold), 2) increasing clustering (2&#8211;10.5&#8208;fold), and 3) increasing concentration (1.3&#8211;8&#8208;fold). Then, multiple biomedical optics tools (e.g., PA, fluorescence imaging, and photothermal therapy) are used to understand the impact of skin tone on these modalities. These well&#8208;defined 3D&#8208;bioprinted phantoms may have value in translating biomedical optics and reducing racial bias.

         <title>In Situ Halide Exchange of Cesium Lead Halide Perovskites for Blue Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 3, January 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient deep&#8208;blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) are achieved by introducing multifunctional organic halide salts to treat perovskite films, which can facilitate halide exchange and passivate defects of 3D perovskites. The LEDs exhibit a peak external quantum efficiency of 4.6% and a luminance of &#8776;1680&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, which show color coordinates of (0.131, 0.055), close to the Rec.&#160;2020 blue standard.








Abstract
3D perovskites are promising to achieve efficient and bright deep&#8208;blue light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), which are required for lighting and display applications. However, the efficiency of deep&#8208;blue 3D perovskite&#8208;based LEDs is limited by high density of defects in perovskites, and their deep&#8208;blue emission is not easy to achieve due to the halide phase separation and low solubility of chloride in precursor solutions. Here, an in situ halide exchange method is developed to achieve deep&#8208;blue 3D perovskites by spin&#8208;coating an organic halide salts solution to treat blue 3D perovskites. It is revealed that the halide&#8208;exchange process is mainly determined by halide ion diffusion targeting a concentration equalization, which leads to homogeneous 3D mixed&#8208;halide perovskites. By further introducing multifunctional organic ammonium halide salts into the exchange solution to passivate defects, high&#8208;quality deep&#8208;blue perovskites with reduced trap density can be obtained. This approach leads to efficient deep&#8208;blue perovskite LEDs with a peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 4.6% and a luminance of 1680&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, which show color coordinates of (0.131, 0.055), very close to the Rec. 2020 blue standard. Moreover, the halide exchange method is bidirectional, and blue perovskite LEDs can be achieved with color coordinates of (0.095, 0.160), exhibiting a high EQE of 11.3%.

This approach leads to efficient deep-blue perovskite LEDs with a peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 4.6% and a luminance of 1680&#160;cd&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which show color coordinates of (0.131, 0.055), very close to the Rec. 2020 blue standard. Moreover, the halide exchange method is bidirectional, and blue perovskite LEDs can be achieved with color coordinates of (0.095, 0.160), exhibiting a high EQE of 11.3%.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Janus Au&#8211;Polymersome Heterostructure with Near&#8208;Field Enhancement Effect for Implant&#8208;Associated Infection Phototherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 3, January 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Janus Au&#8211;porphyrin polymersome heterostructure (J&#8208;AuPPS) is constructed by a facile one&#8208;step photocatalytic synthesis process. The near&#8208;field enhancement effect between the porphyrin polymersome and Au nanoparticles in the as&#8208;prepared J&#8208;AuPPS is achieved to synergistically improve the photochemical activity. As a result, J&#8208;AuPPS shows enhanced in vitro&#160;and in vivo phototherapy effects in bacterial ablation and combating implant&#8208;associated infections.








Abstract
Polymer&#8211;inorganic hybrid Janus nanoparticles (PI&#8208;JNPs) have attracted extensive attention due to their special structures and functions. However, achieving the synergistic enhancement of photochemical activity between polymer and inorganic moieties in PI&#8208;JNPs remains challenging. Herein, the construction of a novel Janus Au&#8211;porphyrin polymersome (J&#8208;AuPPS) heterostructure by a facile one&#8208;step photocatalytic synthesis is reported. The near&#8208;field enhancement (NFE) effect between porphyrin polymersome (PPS) and Au nanoparticles in J&#8208;AuPPS is achieved to enhance its near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light absorption and electric/thermal field intensity at their interface, which improves the energy transfer and energetic charge&#8208;carrier generation. Therefore, J&#8208;AuPPS shows a higher NIR&#8208;activated photothermal conversion efficiency (48.4%) and generates more singlet oxygen compared with non&#8208;Janus core&#8211;particle Au&#8211;PPS nanostructure (28.4%). As a result, J&#8208;AuPPS exhibits excellent dual&#8208;mode (photothermal/photodynamic) antibacterial and anti&#8208;biofilm performance, thereby significantly enhancing&#160;the in vivo therapeutic effect in an implant&#8208;associated&#8208;infection rat model. This work is believed to motivate the rational design of advanced hybrid JNPs with desirable NFE effect and further extend their biological applications.

         <title>Ferrielectricity in the Archetypal Antiferroelectric, PbZrO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 3, January 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Leveraging highly oriented thin films, a ferrielectric phase is observed in PbZrO3 at room temperature and low field. Ferrielectricity is observed in modulations of amplitude and direction of the spontaneous polarization and large anisotropy for critical electric fields, and is qualitatively consistent with theoretical predictions, and correlates with high dielectric tunability and large strains.








Abstract
Antiferroelectric materials, where the transition between antipolar and polar phase is controlled by external electric fields, offer exceptional energy storage capacity with high efficiencies, giant electrocaloric effect, and superb electromechanical response. PbZrO3 is the first discovered and the archetypal antiferroelectric material. Nonetheless, substantial challenges in processing phase pure PbZrO3 have limited studies of the undoped composition, hindering understanding of the phase transitions in this material or unraveling the controversial origins of a low&#8208;field ferroelectric phase observed in lead zirconate thin films. Leveraging highly oriented PbZrO3 thin films, a room&#8208;temperature ferrielectric phase is observed in the absence of external electric fields, with modulations of amplitude and direction of the spontaneous polarization and large anisotropy for critical electric fields required for phase transition. The ferrielectric state observations are qualitatively consistent with theoretical predictions, and correlate with very high dielectric tunability, and ultrahigh strains (up to 1.1%). This work suggests a need for re&#8208;evaluation of the fundamental science of antiferroelectricity in this archetypal&#160;material.

         <title>Highly Efficient Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells through Pentylammonium Acetate Modification with Certified Efficiency of 23.35%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 3, January 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient and stable flexible inverted perovskite solar cells are developed through modifying the interface between perovskite and hole transport layer via pentylammonium acetate molecule, which achieve a record power conversion efficiency of&#160;23.68% (0.08 cm2, certified: 23.35%) and excellent mechanical stability.








Abstract
Among the emerging photovoltaic technologies, rigid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have made tremendous development owing to their exceptional power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to&#160;25.7%. However, the record PCE of flexible PSCs (&#8776;22.4%) still lags far behind their rigid counterparts and their mechanical stabilities are also not satisfactory. Herein, through modifying the interface between perovskite and hole transport layer via pentylammonium acetate (PenAAc) molecule a highly efficient and stable flexible inverted PSC is reported. Through synthetic manipulation of anion and cation, it is shown that the PenA+ and Ac&#8722; have strong chemical binding with both acceptor and donor defects of surface&#8208;terminating ends on perovskite films. The PenAAc&#8208;modified flexible PSCs achieve a record PCE of&#160;23.68% (0.08 cm2, certified: 23.35%) with a high open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of&#160;1.17&#160;V. Large&#8208;area devices (1.0 cm2) also realized an exceptional PCE of&#160;21.52%. Moreover, the fabricated devices show excellent stability under mechanical bending, with PCE remaining above&#160;91% of the original PCE even after&#160;5000 bends.

         <title>An Integrated Polymeric mRNA Vaccine without Inflammation Side Effects for Cellular Immunity Mediated Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 3, January 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of alternating copolymers &#8220;PHTA&#8221; featured with ortho&#8208;hydroxy tertiary amine (HTA) repeat units is&#160;developed for mRNA cancer vaccine delivery. Such an integrated PHTA&#8208;based polymeric nanoplatform shows negligible inflammatory side effects, and the top candidate PHTA&#8208;C18 can successfully deliver mRNA cancer vaccine in vivo, leading to a robust CD8+ T cell mediated antitumor cellular immunity.








Abstract
Among the few available mRNA delivery vehicles, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are the most clinically advanced but they require cumbersome four components and suffer from inflammation&#8208;related side effects that should be minimized for safety. Yet, a certain level of proinflammatory responses and innate immune activation are required to evoke T&#8208;cell immunity for mRNA cancer vaccination. To address these issues and develop potent yet low&#8208;inflammatory mRNA cancer vaccine vectors, a series of alternating copolymers &#8220;PHTA&#8221; featured with ortho&#8208;hydroxy tertiary amine (HTA) repeating units for mRNA delivery is synthesized, which can play triple roles of condensing mRNA, enhancing the polymeric nanoparticle (PNP) stability, and prolonging circulation time. Unlike LNPs exhibiting high levels of inflammation, the PHTA&#8208;based PNPs show negligible inflammatory side effects in vivo. Importantly, the top candidate PHTA&#8208;C18 enables successful mRNA cancer vaccine delivery in vivo and leads&#160;to a robust CD8+ T cell mediated antitumor cellular immunity. Such PHTA&#8208;based integrated PNP provides a potential approach for establishing mRNA cancer vaccines with good inflammatory safety profiles.

         <title>Highly Efficient Flexocatalysis of Two&#8208;Dimensional Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 3, January 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexocatalysis in 2D centrosymmetric semiconductors is demonstrated for the first time via dynamic flexoelectric polarization, largely expanding the polarization&#8208;based mechanocatalysis from non&#8208;centrosymmetric materials into 2D centrosymmetric semiconductors. The flexocatalysis shows the distinguished performance comparable to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art piezocatalysis, with excellent stability and reproducibility. It opens the field of flexoelectric effect&#8208;based mechanochemistry in 2D centrosymmetric semiconductors.








Abstract
Catalysis is vitally important for chemical engineering, energy, and environment. It is critical to discover new mechanisms for efficient catalysis. For piezoelectric/pyroelectric/ferroelectric materials that have a non&#8208;centrosymmetric structure, interfacial polarization&#8208;induced redox reactions at surfaces leads to advanced mechanocatalysis. Here, the first flexocatalysis for 2D centrosymmetric semiconductors, such as MnO2&#160;nanosheets, is demonstrated largely expanding the polarization&#8208;based&#8208;mechanocatalysis to 2D centrosymmetric materials. Under ultrasonic excitation, the reactive species are created due to the strain&#8208;gradient&#8208;induced flexoelectric polarization in MnO2&#160;nanosheets composed nanoflowers. The organic pollutants (Methylene Blue et&#160;al.) can be effectively degraded within 5&#160;min; the performance of the flexocatalysis is comparable to that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art piezocatalysis, with excellent stability and reproducibility. Moreover, the factors related to flexocatalysis such as material morphology, adsorption, mechanical vibration intensity, and temperature are explored, which give deep insights into the mechanocatalysis. This study opens the field of flexoelectric effect&#8208;based mechanochemistry in 2D centrosymmetric semiconductors.

         <title>Hyperelastic Kevlar Nanofiber Aerogels as Robust Thermal Switches for Smart Thermal Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 3, January 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hyperelastic Kevlar nanofiber aerogels (HEKAs) are synthesized by a slow&#8208;proton&#8208;release&#8208;modulating gelation and thermo&#8208;induced crosslinking strategy. The HEKAs exhibit low thermal conductivity and ultralow density, high porosity, and compression resilience. The application of HEKAs as thermal switches is demonstrated, which exhibit high responsive speed and heat flux. The heat loss can be reversibly switched on/off over 50 times.








Abstract
Aerogels, the lightest artificial solid materials characterized by low density and thermal conductivity, high porosity, and large specific surface area, have attracted increasing interest. Aerogels exhibit single&#8208;mode thermal insulation properties regardless of the surrounding temperature. In this study, hyperelastic Kevlar nanofiber aerogels (HEKAs) are designed and fabricated by a slow&#8208;proton&#8208;release&#8208;modulating gelation and thermoinduced crosslinking strategy. The method does not use crosslinking agents and endows the ultralow&#8208;density (4.7 mg cm&#8722;3) HEKAs with low thermal conductivity (0.029 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1), high porosity (99.75%), high thermal stability (550&#160;&#176;C), and increased compression resilience (80%) and fatigue resistance. Proofs of the concept of the HEKAs acting as on&#8211;off thermal switches are demonstrated through experiments and simulations. The thermal switches exhibit a rapid thermal response speed of 0.73&#160;&#176;C s&#8722;1, high heat flux of 2044 J m&#8722;2 s&#8722;1, and switching ratio of 7.5. Heat dissipation can be reversibly switched on/off more than fifty times owing to the hyperelasticity and fatigue resistance of the HEKAs. This study suggests a route to fulfill the hyperelasticity of highly porous aerogels and to tailor heat flux on&#8208;demand.

         <title>Transcranial Nongenetic Neuromodulation via Bioinspired Vesicle&#8208;Enabled Precise NIR&#8208;II Optical Stimulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 3, January 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transcranial nongenetic biological modulation via nanovesicle&#8208;enabled precise second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) optical&#8208;stimulation is presented. The bioinspired vesicles obtained from membrane&#8208;confined enzymatic reactions can mediate NIR&#8208;II photothermal stimuli to elicit neuronal signaling dynamics and evoke defined neural circuits. Eliminating implants and integrating brain&#8208;imaging techniques, the vesicle&#8208;enabled multimodal NIR&#8208;II neurostimulation allows behavioral modulation of nontransgenic organisms with minimal invasiveness and high spatiotemporal resolution.








Abstract
Regulating the activity of specific neurons is essentially important in neurocircuit dissection and neuropathy therapy. As a recently developed strategy, nanomaterial&#8208;enabled nongenetic neuromodulations that realize remote physical stimuli have made vast progress and shown great clinical potential. However, minimal invasiveness and high spatiotemporal resolution are still challenging for nongenetic neuromodulation. Herein, a second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II)&#8208;light&#8208;induced transcranial nongenetic neurostimulation via bioinspired nanovesicles is reported. The rationally designed vesicles are obtained from vesicle&#8208;membrane&#8208;confined enzymatic reactions. This study demonstrates that the vesicle&#8208;enabled NIR&#8208;II photothermal stimuli can elicit neuronal signaling dynamics with precise spatiotemporal control and thus evoke defined neural circuits in nontransgenic mice. Moreover, the vesicle&#8208;mediated NIR&#8208;II optical stimulation can regulate mouse motor behaviors with minimal invasiveness by eliminating light&#8208;emitting implants. Furthermore, the biological modulation is integrated with photoacoustic brain imaging, realizing navigational, and efficient neuromodulation. Such transcranial and precise NIR&#8208;II optical neuromodulation mediated by bioinspired vesicles shows the potential for the optical&#8208;theranostics of neurological diseases in nontransgenic organisms.

         <title>Ultralong Lifetime of Plasmon&#8208;Excited Electrons Realized in Nonepitaxial/Epitaxial Au@CdS/CsPbBr3 Triple&#8208;Heteronanocrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 3, January 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
How to effectively extract the energetic electrons from plasmonic metal and prolong their lifetimes is a daunting challenge for plasmon&#8208;assisted chemistry. Here, it is demonstrated that in contrast to Au/CsPbBr3 directly connected system showing severe plasmon&#8208;exciton suppression, Au@CdS/CsPbBr3 ternary heteronanocrystals with judiciously engineered interfaces enable to leverage the exceptional hot carrier dynamics of halide perovskite and acquire ultralong&#8208;lived plasmon&#8208;excited electrons.








Abstract
Combination of the strong light&#8208;absorbing power of plasmonic metals with the superior charge carrier dynamics of halide perovskites is appealing for bio&#8208;inspired solar&#8208;energy conversion due to the potential to acquire long&#8208;lived plasmon&#8208;induced hot electrons. However, the direct coupling of these two materials, with Au/CsPbBr3 heteronanocrystals (HNCs) as a prototype, results in severe suppression of plasmon resonances. The present work shows that interfacial engineering is a key knob for overcoming this impediment, based on the creation of a CdS mediate layer between Au and CsPbBr3 forming atomically organized Au&#8208;CdS and CdS&#8208;CsPbBr3 interfaces by nonepitaxial/epitaxial combined strategy. Transient spectroscopy studies demonstrate that the resulting Au@CdS/CsPbBr3 HNCs generate remarkably long&#8208;lived plasmon&#8208;induced charge carriers with lifetime up to nanosecond timescale, which is several orders of magnitude longer than those reported for colloidal plasmonic metal&#8208;semiconductor systems. Such long&#8208;lived carriers extracted from plasmonic antennas enable to drive CO2 photoreduction with efficiency outperforming previously reported CsPbBr3&#8208;based photocatalysts. The findings disclose a new paradigm for achieving much elongated time windows to harness the substantial energy of transient plasmons through realization of synergistic coupling of plasmonic metals and halide perovskites.

         <dc:description>
Transition&#8208;metal carbides/nitrides (MXene)&#8208;organic single crystal vertical transistor exhibits a fast switching characteristic under an ultralow operating voltage of &#8722;1&#160;mV, meanwhile consumes only 8.7 aJ per spike when working as an electrical synaptic transistor.








Abstract
Organic field&#8208;effect transistors with parallel transmission and learning functions are of interest in the development of brain&#8208;inspired neuromorphic computing. However, the poor performance and high power consumption are the two main issues limiting their practical applications. Herein, an ultralow&#8208;power vertical transistor is demonstrated based on transition&#8208;metal carbides/nitrides (MXene) and organic single crystal. The transistor exhibits a high JON of 16.6&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a high JON/JOFF ratio of 9.12 &#215; 105 under an ultralow working voltage of &#8722;1&#160;mV. Furthermore, it can successfully simulate the functions of biological synapse under electrical modulation along with consuming only 8.7 aJ of power per spike. It also permits multilevel information decoding modes with a significant gap between the readable time of professionals and nonprofessionals, producing a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio up to 114.15&#160;dB. This work encourages the use of vertical transistors and organic single crystal in decoding information and advances the development of low&#8208;power neuromorphic systems.

         <title>Enhancing Electron Correlation at a 3d Ferromagnetic Surface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 3, January 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Does adatom adsorption on the surface of a 3D ferromagnet influence electron correlation? A far from trivial question! Using state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art theoretical and experimental methods, it is found that an iron surface in contact with oxygen represents a moderately correlated system with some features in between metallic Fe and the Mott insulator FeO.








Abstract
Spin&#8208;resolved momentum microscopy and theoretical calculations are combined beyond the one&#8208;electron approximation to unveil the spin&#8208;dependent electronic structure of the interface formed between iron (Fe) and an ordered oxygen (O) atomic layer, and an adsorbate&#8208;induced enhancement of electronic correlations is found. It is demonstrated that this enhancement is responsible for a drastic narrowing of the Fe d&#8208;bands close to the Fermi energy (EF) and a reduction of the exchange splitting, which is not accounted for in the Stoner picture of ferromagnetism. In addition, correlation leads to a significant spin&#8208;dependent broadening of the electronic bands at higher binding energies and their merging with satellite features, which are manifestations of a pure many&#8208;electron behavior. Overall, adatom adsorption can be used to vary the material parameters of transition metal surfaces to access different intermediate electronic correlated regimes, which will otherwise not be accessible. The results show that the concepts developed to understand the physics and chemistry of adsorbate&#8211;metal interfaces, relevant for a variety of research areas, from spintronics to catalysis, need to be reconsidered with many&#8208;particle effects being of utmost importance. These may affect chemisorption energy, spin transport, magnetic order, and even play a key role in the emergence of ferromagnetism at interfaces between non&#8208;magnetic systems.

         <title>Orbital Interactions between the Organic Semiconductor Spacer and the Inorganic Layer in Dion&#8211;Jacobson Perovskites Enable Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 3, January 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A semiconductor spacer, namely bithiophenedimethylamine (BThDMA), is successfully developed for 2D Dion&#8211;Jacobson (DJ) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and high photovoltaic performance is demonstrated. An important finding is that there are strong orbital interactions between the conjugated organic spacer and the adjacent inorganic layers, whereas no such interactions exist in DJ perovskites using an insulating aliphatic spacer with similar length.








Abstract
2D Dion&#8211;Jacobson (DJ) perovskites have become emerging photovoltaic materials owing to their intrinsic structure stability. However, as insulating aliphatic cations are widely used as spacers, the interactions between the spacers and inorganic layers in DJ perovskites have rarely been studied. Here, an organic semiconductor spacer with two covalently connected thiophene rings, namely bithiophene dimethylammonium (BThDMA), is successfully developed for 2D DJ perovskite solar cells (PSCs). An important finding is that there are strong orbital interactions between the conjugated organic spacer and adjacent inorganic layers, whereas no such interactions exist in DJ perovskite using an aliphatic octane&#8208;1,8&#8208;diaminium (ODA) spacer with similar length. The BThDMA spacer with multiple conjugated aromatic rings can also induce crystal growth with large grain size and preferred vertical orientation, resulting in reduced trap density and improved charge&#8208;carrier mobility. As a result, the optimized device based on (BThDMA)MAn&#8722;1PbnI3n+1 (nominal n&#160;= 5) shows an excellent PCE of 18.1% with negligible hysteresis, which is a record efficiency for 2D DJ PSCs using a spacer with two or more covalently linked aromatic rings. These findings provide a novel and important insight on achieving efficient and stable 2D DJ perovskite solar cells by developing organic semiconductor spacers.

         <title>A Therapeutic Nanovaccine that Generates Anti&#8208;Amyloid Antibodies and Amyloid&#8208;specific Regulatory T Cells for Alzheimer's Disease</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 3, January 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rapamycin&#8208;incorporated lipid nanoparticle containing amyloid&#8208;&#946; (LNP&#8208;R/A&#946;) attenuates neuroinflammation and improves cognitive function in a transgenic rodent model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by inducing tolerogenic dendritic cells and A&#946;&#8208;specific regulatory T cells, and generating anti&#8208;amyloid antibodies. Furthermore, LNP&#8208;R/A&#946; reduces T helper 1 cells in AD brains, implying lower risks of meningitis, which is the major reason for the failure of conventional A&#946; vaccines.








Abstract
Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia, is a complex condition characterized by multiple pathophysiological mechanisms including amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) plaque accumulation and neuroinflammation in the brain. The current immunotherapy approaches, such as anti&#8208;A&#946; monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy, A&#946; vaccines, and adoptive regulatory T (Treg) cell transfer, target a single pathophysiological mechanism, which may lead to unsatisfactory therapeutic efficacy. Furthermore, A&#946; vaccines often induce T helper 1 (Th1) cell&#8208;mediated inflammatory responses. Here, a nanovaccine composed of lipid nanoparticles loaded with A&#946; peptides and rapamycin is developed, which targets multiple pathophysiological mechanisms, exhibits the combined effects of anti&#8208;A&#946; antibody therapy and adoptive A&#946;&#8208;specific Treg cell transfer, and can overcome the limitations of current immunotherapy approaches for AD. The Nanovaccine effectively delivers rapamycin and A&#946; peptides to dendritic cells, produces both anti&#8208;A&#946; antibodies and A&#946;&#8208;specific Treg cells, removes A&#946; plaques in the brain, alleviates neuroinflammation, prevents Th1 cell&#8208;mediated excessive immune responses, and inhibits cognitive impairment in mice. The nanovaccine shows higher&#160;efficacy in cognitive recovery than an A&#946; vaccine. Unlike anti&#8208;A&#946; mAb therapy and adoptive Treg cell transfer, both of which require complicated and costly manufacturing processes, the nanovaccine is easy&#8208;to&#8208;prepare and cost&#8208;effective. The nanovaccines can represent a novel treatment option for AD.

         <title>Refining Perovskite Heterojunctions for Effective Light&#8208;Emitting Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 3, January 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double&#8208;heterojunction refinement strategy with wide&#8208;bandgap salts is used to engineer the bottom interfaces and the top interfaces associated with a perovskite. The double&#8208;heterojunction refinement allows both efficient light&#8208;harvesting through a photovoltaic response and light&#8208;emission under ultralow bias in the same device. By connecting to an electric battery, a multifunctional harvesting&#8211;storage&#8211;utilization system is realized.








Abstract
Solar cells capable of light&#8208;harvesting during daytime and light&#8208;emission at night are multifunctional semiconductor devices with many potential applications.

&lt;p&gt;A double-heterojunction refinement strategy with wide-bandgap salts is used to engineer the bottom interfaces and the top interfaces associated with a perovskite. The double-heterojunction refinement allows both efficient light-harvesting through a photovoltaic response and light-emission under ultralow bias in the same device. By connecting to an electric battery, a multifunctional harvesting&#8211;storage&#8211;utilization system is realized.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solar cells capable of light-harvesting during daytime and light-emission at night are multifunctional semiconductor devices with many potential applications. Here, it is reported that halide perovskite heterojunction interfaces can be refined to yield stable and efficient solar cells. The cell can also operate effectively as an ultralow-voltage light-emitting diode (LED) with a peak external quantum efficiency&#160;of electroluminescence (EQE&lt;sub&gt;EL&lt;/sub&gt;)&#160;of 3.3%. Spectroscopic and microscopic studies reveal that double-heterojunction refinement with wide-bandgap salts is key to densifying the packing of perovskite grains and enlarging the bandgaps of the perovskite surfaces that are in contact with charge-transport semiconductors.

         <title>Reversal of Anomalous Hall Effect and Octahedral Tilting in SrRuO3 Thin Films via Hydrogen Spillover</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 3, January 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The perovskite SrRuO3 is a prototypical itinerant ferromagnet that has drawn considerable attention due to its strongly correlated physical properties. In this work, a new concept is demonstrated to induce octahedral distortions, magnetism, and reversal of the anomalous Hall effect in SrRuO3 thin films via hydrogen spillover, revealed by comprehensive in situ experiments and density functional theory calculations.








Abstract
The perovskite SrRuO3 (SRO) is a strongly correlated oxide whose physical and structural properties are strongly intertwined. Notably, SRO is an itinerant ferromagnet that exhibits a large anomalous Hall effect (AHE) whose sign can be readily modified. Here, a hydrogen spillover method is used to tailor the properties of SRO thin films via hydrogen incorporation. It is found that the magnetization and Curie temperature of the films are strongly reduced and, at the same time, the structure evolves from an orthorhombic to a tetragonal phase as the hydrogen content is increased up to &#8776;0.9 H per SRO formula unit. The structural phase transition is shown, via in situ crystal truncation rod measurements, to be related to tilting of the RuO6 octahedral units. The significant changes observed in magnetization are shown, via density functional theory (DFT), to be a consequence of shifts in the Fermi level. The reported findings provide new insights into the physical properties of SRO via tailoring its lattice symmetry and emergent physical phenomena via the hydrogen spillover technique.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Gate&#8208;Tunable Nonreciprocal Charge Transport in Lattice&#8208;Matched InSb/CdTe Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 3, January 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lattice&#8208;matched InSb/CdTe heterostructures are utilized to tailor the nonreciprocal charge transport up to room temperature. Benefiting from both the inversion symmetry breaking and interfacial Rashba spin&#8211;orbit coupling, this nonmagnetic hybrid system not only warrants a pronounced unidirectional magnetoresistance effect, but also enables highly efficient gate tuning of the rectification response, hence offering feasible strategies for controllable spin&#8211;orbit applications.








Abstract
Symmetry manipulation can be used to effectively tailor the physical order in solid&#8208;state systems. With the breaking of both the inversion and time&#8208;reversal symmetries, nonreciprocal magneto&#8208;transport may arise in nonmagnetic systems to enrich spin&#8211;orbit effects. Here, the observation of unidirectional magnetoresistance (UMR) in lattice&#8208;matched InSb/CdTe films is investigated up to room temperature. Benefiting from the strong built&#8208;in electric field of 0.13 V&#160;nm&#8722;1 in the heterojunction region, the resulting Rashba&#8208;type spin&#8211;orbit coupling and quantum confinement result in a distinct sinusoidal UMR signal with a nonreciprocal coefficient that is 1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude larger than most non&#8208;centrosymmetric materials at 298 K. Moreover, this heterostructure configuration enables highly efficient gate tuning of the rectification response, wherein the UMR amplitude is enhanced by 40%. The results of this study advocate the use of narrow&#8208;bandgap semiconductor&#8208;based hybrid systems with robust spin textures as suitable platforms for the pursuit of controllable chiral spin&#8211;orbit applications.

         <title>P&#8208;Mediated Cu&#8211;N4 Sites in Carbon Nitride Realizing CO2 Photoreduction to C2H4 with Selectivity Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 3, January 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu&#8211;N4 sites anchored P&#8208;modulated carbon nitride (CuACs/PCN) is prepared as a photocatalyst to tailor the intermediate energy levels in the C2H4 formation reaction pathway. The formation of the C&#8722;C coupling intermediates can be realized on Cu&#8211;N4 sites, and the surrounding P facilitates the C2H4 production. CuACs/PCN exhibits a high C2H4 selectivity of 53.2% with a yield of 30.51&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1.








Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction to high value&#8208;added C2 products (e.g., C2H4) is of considerable interest but challenging. The C2H4 product selectivity strongly hinges on the intermediate energy levels in the CO2 reduction pathway. Herein, Cu&#8211;N4 sites anchored phosphorus&#8208;modulated carbon nitride (CuACs/PCN) is designed as a photocatalyst to tailor the intermediate energy levels in the the C2H4 formation reaction pathway for realizing its high production with tunable selectivity. Theoretical calculations combined with experimental data demonstrate that the formation of the C&#8722;C coupling intermediates can be realized on Cu&#8211;N4 sites and the surrounding doped P facilitates the production of C2H4. Thus, CuACs/PCN exhibits a high C2H4 selectivity of 53.2% with a yielding rate of 30.51 &#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1. The findings reveal the significant role of the coordination environment and surrounding microenvironment of Cu single atoms in C2H4 formation and offer an effective approach for highly selective CO2 photoreduction to produce C2H4.

         <title>In Situ Encapsulated Moir&#233; Perovskite for Stable Photodetectors with Ultrahigh Polarization Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 3, January 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Owing to its enhanced light collection ability, the Moir&#233;&#8208;lattice&#8208;structured perovskite photodetectors (PDs) in situ encapsulated by two nano&#8208;grating&#8208;structured Polydimethylsiloxane show a responsivity up to 1026.5&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1. The PD still maintained 95% performance after exposure to air for 233 days. The Moir&#233;&#8208;lattice structures endow the PD a dichroism ratio of up to 9.1.








Abstract
Nanostructures provide a simple, effective, and low&#8208;cost route to enhance the light&#8208;trapping capability of optoelectronic devices. In recent years, nano&#8208;optical structures have been widely used in perovskite optoelectronic devices to greatly enhance the device performance. However, the inherent instability of perovskite materials hinders the practical application of these nanostructured optoelectronic devices. Here, in situ encapsulated moir&#233; lattice perovskite photodetectors (PDs) by two nanograting&#8208;structured soft templates with relative rotation angles is fabricated. The confinement growth of the two nanograting templates leads to crystal growth with moir&#233; lattice structure, which improves the light&#8208;harvesting ability of the perovskite crystal, thereby improving the device performance. The PD&#160;exhibits responsivity to 1026.5&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1. The Moir&#233; lattice&#8208;perovskite&#8208;based PD maintained 95% of the initial performance after 223&#160;days. After being continuously sprayed with water moist for 180&#160;min, the performance is maintained at 95.7% of its initial level. The nanograting structure endows the device with high polarization sensitivity of Imax/Imin as high as 9.1.

The PD still maintained 95% performance after exposure to air for 233 days. The Moir&#233;-lattice structures endow the PD a dichroism ratio of up to 9.1.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nanostructures provide a simple, effective, and low-cost route to enhance the light-trapping capability of optoelectronic devices. In recent years, nano-optical structures have been widely used in perovskite optoelectronic devices to greatly enhance the device performance. However, the inherent instability of perovskite materials hinders the practical application of these nanostructured optoelectronic devices. Here, in situ encapsulated moir&#233; lattice perovskite photodetectors (PDs) by two nanograting-structured soft templates with relative rotation angles is fabricated. The confinement growth of the two nanograting templates leads to crystal growth with moir&#233; lattice structure, which improves the light-harvesting ability of the perovskite crystal, thereby improving the device performance. The PD&#160;exhibits responsivity to 1026.5&#160;A&#160;W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The Moir&#233; lattice-perovskite-based PD maintained 95% of the initial performance after 223&#160;days. After being continuously sprayed with water moist for 180&#160;min, the performance is maintained at 95.7% of its initial level. The nanograting structure endows the device with high polarization sensitivity of &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;/&lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt; as high as 9.1.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Probiotic&#8208;Inspired Nanomedicine Restores Intestinal Homeostasis in Colitis by Regulating Redox Balance, Immune Responses, and the Gut Microbiome</title>

Probiotic&#8208;inspired drug&#8208;free nanomedicine ameliorates inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) by restoring redox balance, immune responses, and the gut microbiome.








Abstract
Microbiota&#8208;based therapeutics offer innovative strategies to treat inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). However, the poor clinical outcome so far and the limited flexibility of the bacterial approach call for improvement. Inspired by the health benefits of probiotics in alleviating symptoms of bowel diseases, bioartificial probiotics are designed to restore the intestinal microenvironment in colitis by regulating redox balance, immune responses, and the gut microbiome. The bioartificial probiotic comprises two components: an E. coli Nissle 1917&#8208;derived membrane (EM) as the surface and the biodegradable diselenide&#8208;bridged mesoporous silica nanoparticles (SeM) as the core. When orally administered, the probiotic&#8208;inspired nanomedicine (SeM@EM) adheres strongly to the mucus layer and restored intestinal redox balance and immune regulation homeostasis in a murine model of acute colitis induced by dextran sodium sulfate. In addition, the respective properties of the EM and SeM synergistically alter the gut microbiome to a favorable state by increasing the bacterial diversity and shifting the microbiome profile to an anti&#8208;inflammatory phenotype. This work suggests a safe and effective nanomedicine that can restore intestinal homeostasis for IBDs therapy.

         <title>A Noble&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Spintronic System with Proximity&#8208;Enhanced Ferromagnetic Topological Surface State of FeSi above Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 3, January 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism and strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling are realized at a novel topological surface state of the nonmagnetic insulator FeSi by exploiting the proximity effect from a wide&#8208;bandgap insulator. A consequent spintronic functionality, that is, current&#8208;induced magnetization switching at room temperature, shows great potential for the application of proximity&#8208;controlled light&#8208;element topological materials as noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free devices.








Abstract
Strongly spin&#8211;orbit coupled states at metal interfaces, topological insulators, and 2D materials enable efficient electric control of spin states, offering great potential for spintronics. However, there are still materials challenges to overcome, including the integration into advanced silicon electronics and the scarce resources of constituent heavy elements of those materials. Through magneto&#8208;transport measurements and first&#8208;principles calculations, here robust spin&#8211;orbit coupling (SOC)&#8208;induced properties of a ferromagnetic topological surface state in FeSi and their controllability via hybridization with adjacent materials are demonstrated. In comparison to the case of its naturally oxidized surface, the ferromagnetic transition temperature is greatly increased beyond room temperature and the effective SOC strength is almost doubled at the surface in proximity to a wide&#8208;bandgap fluoride insulator. Those enhanced magnetic properties enable room&#8208;temperature magnetization switching, being applicable to spin&#8211;orbit torque based spintronic devices. Realization of strong SOC in the noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free silicon&#8208;based compound will accelerate spintronic applications.

         <title>Bone&#8208;Adhesive Anisotropic Tough Hydrogel Mimicking Tendon Enthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 3, January 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strong adhesive triple&#8208;network hydrogel consisting of ionically cross&#8208;linked alginate, polyacrylamide, and adhesive imidazole&#8208;containing polyaspartamide derivatives subjected to stretching&#8208;mediated linear remodeling followed by cross&#8208;linking exhibits strong mechanical properties and high adhesiveness. The hydrogel exhibits an anisotropic structure similar to that of tendons. The proposed hydrogel is promising for the development of artificial tendons and clinical applications.








Abstract
Tendon consists of soft collagen, yet it is mechanically strong and firmly adhered to the bone owing to its hierarchically anisotropic structure and unique tendon&#8208;to&#8208;bone integration (enthesis), respectively. Despite the recent advances in biomaterials, hydrogels simultaneously providing tendon&#8208;like high mechanical properties and strong adhesion to bone&#8208;mimicking enthesis is still challenging. Here, a strong, stiff, and adhesive triple&#8208;network (TN) anisotropic hydrogel that mimics a bone&#8208;adhering tendon is shown. The tough adhesive TN hydrogel is developed by combining imidazole&#8208;containing polyaspartamide (providing multiple hydrogen bonds to the bone surface) and energy&#8208;dissipative alginate&#8211;polyacrylamide double&#8208;network. To mimic the anisotropic structure and high mechanical properties of tendons, the bone&#8208;adhered TN hydrogel is linearly stretched and subsequently fixed via secondary cross&#8208;linking. The resulting hydrogel exhibits high tensile modulus and strength while maintaining a high bone adhesion without chemical modification of the bone surface. Furthermore, a bone&#8211;ligament&#8211;bone structure with strong bone adhesion reminiscent of the natural ligament is realized.

         <title>Fluorination Enhances NIR&#8208;II Emission and Photothermal Conversion Efficiency of Phototheranostic Agents for Imaging&#8208;Guided Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 3, January 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorination of A&#8211;D&#8211;A type planar phototheranostic agents can simultaneously enhance NIR&#8208;II quantum yield (QY) and photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE). Accordingly, the structure of vasculature and NIR&#8208;IIimaging&#8208;guided photothermal therapy of tumor are successfully achieved owing to the high NIR&#8208;II QY (4.2%) and PCE (80%) of fluorinated phototheranostic agents. This work provides an intriguing guideline for designing highly efficient NIR&#8208;II phototheranostic agents.








Abstract
Phototheranostics with second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) imaging and photothermal effect have become a burgeoning biotechnology for tumor diagnosis and precise treatment. As important parameters of phototheranostic agents (PTAs), fluorescence quantum yield (QY) and photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) are usually considered as a pair of contradictions that is difficult to be simultaneously enhanced. Herein, a fluorination strategy for designing A&#8211;D&#8211;A type PTAs with synchronously improved QY and PCE is proposed. Experimental results show that the molar extinction coefficient (&#949;), NIR&#8208;II QY, and PCE of all fluorinated PTAs nanoparticles (NPs) are definitely improved compared with the chlorinated counterparts. Theoretical calculation results demonstrate that fluorination can maximize the electrostatic potential difference by virtue of the high electronegativity of fluorine, which may increase intra/intermolecular D&#8211;A interactions, tighten molecule packing,&#160;and further promote the increase of &#949;, ultimately leading to simultaneously enhanced QY and PCE. In these PTA NPs, FY6&#8208;NPs display NIR&#8208;II emission extended to 1400&#160;nm with the highest NIR&#8208;II QY (4.2%) and PCE (80%). These features make FY6&#8208;NPs perform well in high&#8208;resolution imaging of vasculature and NIR&#8208;II imaging&#8208;guided photothermal therapy (PTT) of tumors. This study develops a valuable guideline for constructing NIR&#8208;II organic PTAs with high performance.

         <title>Atomically Flat, 2D Edge&#8208;Directed Self&#8208;Assembly of Block Copolymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 3, January 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically flat, 2D&#160;edge directed self&#8208;assembly of block copolymers are demonstrated as sub&#8208;10 nm nanopatterns that are remarkably well&#8208;aligned along the atomic edge of 2D flakes, including graphene, MoS2, and h&#8208;BN, and they are readily exploited for nanoscale shape engineering of 2D materials. The resultant highly aligned sub&#8208;10&#8208;nm&#8208;wide graphene nanoribbon exhibits superior switching characteristics (on&#8208;to&#8208;off ratio of &#8776;6 &#215; 104).








Abstract
Nanoscale shape engineering is an essential requirement for the practical use of 2D&#160;materials, aiming at precisely customizing optimal structures and properties. In this work, sub&#8208;10&#8208;nm&#8208;scale block copolymer (BCP) self&#8208;assembled nanopatterns finely aligned along the atomic edge of 2D flakes, including graphene, MoS2, and h&#8208;BN, are exploited for reliable nanopatterning of 2D materials. The underlying mechanism for the alignment of the self&#8208;assembled nanodomains is elucidated based on the wetting layer alternation of the BCP film in the presence of intermediate 2D flakes. The resultant highly aligned nanocylinder templates with remarkably low levels of line edge roughness (LER) and line&#8208;width roughness (LWR) yield a sub&#8208;10&#8208;nm&#8208;wide graphene nanoribbon (GNR) array with noticeable switching characteristics (on&#8208;to&#8208;off ratio up to &#8776;6 &#215; 104).

         <title>Ultralow&#8208;Temperature Li/CFx Batteries Enabled by Fast&#8208;Transport and Anion&#8208;Pairing Liquefied Gas Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 3, January 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Primary batteries serve as indispensable power sources for hard&#8208;to&#8208;reach places or when recharging is unnecessary. A Li/CFx&#160;primary battery with practical loading is developed to provide high energy density down to &#8722;70&#160;&#176;C, which is enabled by a liquefied gas electrolyte providing fast transport and anion&#8208;pairing. These design principles are of high interest to similar battery systems operating under extreme conditions.








Abstract
Lithium fluorinated&#8208;carbon (Li/CFx) is one of the most promising chemistries for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density primary energy&#8208;storage systems in applications where rechargeability is not required. Though Li/CFx demonstrates high energy density (&gt;2100&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1) under ambient conditions, achieving such a high energy density when exposed to subzero temperatures remains a challenge, particularly under high current density. Here, a liquefied gas electrolyte with an anion&#8208;pair solvation structure based on dimethyl ether with a low melting point (&#8722;141&#160;&#176;C) and low viscosity (0.12 mPa s, 20&#160;&#176;C), leading to high ionic conductivity (&gt;3.5 mS cm&#8722;1) between &#8722;70 and 60&#160;&#176;C is reported. Besides that, through systematic X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy integrated with transmission electron microscopy characterizations, the interface of CFx is evaluated for low&#8208;temperature performance. The fast transport and anion&#8208;pairing solvation structure of the electrolyte are concluded to bring about reduced charge&#8208;transfer resistance at low temperatures, which results in significantly enhanced performance of Li/CFx cells (1690 Wh kg&#8722;1, &#8722;60&#160;&#176;C based on active materials). Utilizing 50&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 loading electrodes, the Li/CFx still displays 1530&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at &#8722;60&#160;&#176;C. This work provides insights into the electrolyte design that may overcome the operational limits of batteries in extreme environments.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Doping&#8208;Induced Mobility Modulation Effect for Transport Enhancement in Organic Single&#8208;Crystal Transistors</title>

Mobilities of transistors based on dinaphtho[2,3&#8208;b:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;f]&#8208;thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene (DNTT) single crystals are robustly increased via van der Waals epitaxy of crystalline 1,3,4,5,7,8&#8208;hexafluoro&#8208;tetracyanonaphthoquinodimethane (F6TCNNQ) on surface of DNTT crystals. Mobility Modulation Effect from interplay between charge transfer interface and gate electric field has been proposed responsible for transport enhancements, which sufficiently utilizes the high mobility of the bulk transport in the crystals.








Abstract
Molecular doping has conventionally been an effective way to improve the electrical&#8208;transport performances in organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs), while corresponding mechanisms associated with specific doping techniques have been less investigated and discussed in detail. Here, based on ultrathin dinaphtho[2,3&#8208;b:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;f]&#8208;thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene (DNTT) single crystals, robust transconductance enhancements are realized in OFETs upon surface molecular doping realized via van der Waals epitaxially growing crystalline 1,3,4,5,7,8&#8208;hexafluoro&#8208;tetracyanonaphthoquinodimethane (F6TCNNQ) onto the single crystal's surface. It is proposed that it is the mobility modulation effect (MME) from the interactions between charge&#8208;transfer interface and gate electric field, that contributes to more weighted bulk carriers, and finally improves charge&#8208;transport performances. The evaluations are further supported by scanning Kelvin probe microscopy&#160;(SKPM) surface potential characterizations, which manifest the gate&#8208;induced more delocalized holes near the charge&#8208;transfer interfaces. Space&#8208;charge&#8208;limited current (SCLC) investigations, numerical calculations, and theoretical mobility modeling are also performed to corroborate the analysis. This study can deepen the understanding of charge transport in doped semiconductors and provide effective ways for optimizing the electrical performance of organic devices.

         <title>Engineering Electrodes with Robust Conducting Hydrogel Coating for Neural Recording and Modulation</title>

Bioelectrodes with Robust Conducting Hydrogel Coating for Neural recording and Modulation: Bioelectrodes are engineered with a conducting hydrogel layer, featuring robust interfacial adhesion, long&#8208;term reliability, highly&#8208;desirable electronic conductivity, and mechanical compliance, for long&#8208;term electrophysiological recordings of neural activities and low&#8208;voltage electrical stimulation.








Abstract
Coating conventional metallic electrodes with conducting polymers has enabled the essential characteristics required for bioelectronics, such as biocompatibility, electrical conductivity, mechanical compliance, and the capacity for structural and chemical functionalization of the bioelectrodes. However, the fragile interface between the conducting polymer and the electrode in wet physiological environment greatly limits their utility and reliability. Here, a general yet reliable strategy to seamlessly interface conventional electrodes with conducting hydrogel coatings is established, featuring tissue&#8208;like modulus, highly&#8208;desirable electrochemical properties, robust interface, and long&#8208;term reliability. Numerical modeling reveals the role of toughening mechanism, synergy of covalent anchorage of long&#8208;chain polymers, and chemical cross&#8208;linking, in improving the long&#8208;term robustness of the interface. Through in vivo implantation in freely&#8208;moving mouse models, it is shown that stable electrophysiological recording can be achieved, while the conducting hydrogel&#8211;electrode interface remains robust during the long&#8208;term low&#8208;voltage electrical stimulation. This simple yet versatile design strategy addresses the long&#8208;standing technical challenges in functional bioelectrode engineering, and opens up new avenues for the next&#8208;generation diagnostic brain&#8208;machine&#160;interfaces.

         <title>Phosphorous Dendron Micelles as a Nanomedicine Platform for Cooperative Tumor Chemoimmunotherapy via Synergistic Modulation of Immune Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 3, January 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A doxorubicin&#8208;loaded nanomedicine formulation based on phosphorus dendron micelles with intrinsic immunomodulatory activity is constructed. The created nanomedicine can synergistically proliferate natural killer (NK) cells, recruit tumor&#8208;infiltrating NK cells and cytotoxic T cells, and decrease regulatory T cells, thus allowing for chemoimmunotherapy of tumors with strong antitumor immunity and immune memory effect for effective prevention of lung metastasis.








Abstract
Design of effective nanomedicines to modulate multiple immune cells to overcome the immune&#8208;suppressive tumor microenvironment is desirable to improve the overall poor clinical outcomes of immunotherapy. Herein, a nanomedicine platform is reported based on chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin (DOX)&#8208;loaded phosphorus dendron micelles (M&#8208;G1&#8208;TBPNa@DOX, TBP, tyramine bearing two dimethylphosphonate) with inherent immunomodulatory activity for synergistic tumor chemoimmunotherapy. The M&#8208;G1&#8208;TBPNa@DOX micelles with good stability and a mean particle size of 86.4 nm can deliver DOX to solid tumors to induce significant tumor cell apoptosis and immunogenic cell death (ICD). With the demonstrated intrinsic activity of M&#8208;G1&#8208;TBPNa that can promote the proliferation of natural killer (NK) cells, the ICD&#8208;resulted maturation of dendritic cells of the DOX&#8208;loaded micelles, and the combination of anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibody, the synergistic modulation of multiple immune cells through NK cell proliferation, recruitment of tumor&#8208;infiltrating NK cells and cytotoxic T cells, and decrease of regulatory T cells for effective tumor chemoimmunotherapy with strong antitumor immunity and immune memory effect for effective prevention of lung metastasis are demonstrated. The developed phosphorous dendron micelles may hold great promise to be used as an advanced nanomedicine formulation for synergistic modulation of multiple immune cells through NK cell proliferation for effective chemoimmunotherapy of different tumor types.

         <title>Corrosion&#8208;Resistant and High&#8208;Entropic Non&#8208;Noble&#8208;Metal Electrodes for Oxygen Evolution in Acidic Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 3, January 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Corrosion&#8208;resistant non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal catalysts demonstrate the possibility of replacing noble metals such as IrO2 as anode catalysts in acidic media. The place replacement of Ni and Co as catalytically active elements in passivation elements such as Ti, Zr, Nb, and Mo plays an important role in enhancing oxygen evolution reaction activity.








Abstract
To realize a sustainable hydrogen economy, corrosion&#8208;resistant non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal catalysts are needed to replace noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts. The combination of passivation elements and catalytically active elements is crucial for simultaneously achieving high corrosion resistance and high catalytic activity. Herein, the self&#8208;selection/reconstruction characteristics of multi&#8208;element (nonary) alloys that can automatically redistribute suitable elements and rearrange surface structures under the target reaction conditions during the oxygen evolution reaction are investigated. The following synergetic effect (i.e., cocktail effect), among the elements Ti, Zr, Nb, and Mo, significantly contributes to passivation, whereas Cr, Co, Ni, Mn, and Fe enhance the catalytic activity. According to the practical water electrolysis experiments, the self&#8208;selected/reconstructed multi&#8208;element alloy demonstrates high performance under a similar condition with proton exchange membrane (PEM)&#8208;type water electrolysis without obvious degradation during stability tests. This verifies the resistance of the alloy to corrosion when used as an electrode under a practical PEM electrolysis condition.

         <title>Aggregation&#8208;Induced&#8208;Emission Photosensitizer&#8208;Loaded Nano&#8208;Superartificial Dendritic Cells with Directly Presenting Tumor Antigens and Reversed Immunosuppression for Photodynamically Boosted Immunotherapy</title>

         <dc:description>
Nano&#8208;superartificial dendritic cells (saDC@Fs&#8208;NPs) are developed by coating superartificial dendritic cells membranes onto aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) photosensitizers. The outer cell membranes are derived from engineered 4T1 cells in which pMHC&#8208;I, CD86, and anti&#8208;LAG3 are simultaneously anchored. saDC@Fs&#8208;NPs directly stimulate T&#8208;cell activation and reverse T&#8208;cell exhaustion for cancer immunotherapy. The inner AIE&#8208;active photosensitizers induce immunogenic cell death to improve tumor microenvironment, which boosts immunotherapy efficiency.








Abstract
The success of tumor immunotherapy highlights the potential of harnessing immune system to fight cancer. Activating both native T cells and exhausted T cells is a critical step for generating effective antitumor immunity, which is determined based on the efficient presentation of tumor antigens and co&#8208;stimulatory signals by antigen&#8208;presenting cells, as well as immunosuppressive reversal. However, strategies for achieving an efficient antigen presentation process and improving the&#160;immunosuppressive microenvironment remain unresolved. Here, aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission (AIE) photosensitizer&#8208;loaded nano&#8208;superartificial dendritic cells (saDC@Fs&#8208;NPs) are developed by coating superartificial dendritic cells membranes from genetically engineered 4T1 tumor cells onto nanoaggregates of AIE photosensitizers. The outer cell membranes of saDC@Fs&#8208;NPs are derived from recombinant lentivirus&#8208;infected 4T1 tumor cells in which peptide&#8208;major histocompatibility complex class I, CD86, and anti&#8208;LAG3 antibody are simultaneously anchored. These saDC@Fs&#8208;NPs could directly stimulate T&#8208;cell activation and reverse T&#8208;cell exhaustion for cancer immunotherapy. The inner AIE&#8208;active photosensitizers induce immunogenic cell death to activate dendritic cells and enhance T lymphocyte infiltration by photodynamic therapy, promoting the transformation of &#8220;cold tumors&#8221; into &#8220;hot tumors,&#8221; which further boosts&#160;immunotherapy efficiency. This work presents a powerful photoactive and artificial antigen&#8208;presenting platform for activating both native T cells and exhausted T cells, as well as facilitating tumor photodynamic immunotherapy.

         <title>Controlling Mineralization with Protein&#8208;Functionalized Peptoid Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 3, January 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptoid nanotubes functionalized with solid&#8208;binding proteins are used to achieve sub&#8208;5&#197; control over the size of TiO2 particles in a 1.4 to 4.4 nm range that has heretofore been inaccessible to biomimetic mineralization. These novel hybrid nanostructures also support the synthesis of gold nanoparticles, and the dual mineralization of TiO2 and gold to yield integrated nanocomposites capable of photocatalytic activity under visible&#8208;light illumination.








Abstract
Sequence&#8208;defined foldamers that self&#8208;assemble into well&#8208;defined architectures are promising scaffolds to template inorganic mineralization. However, it has been challenging to achieve robust control of nucleation and growth without sequence redesign or extensive experimentation. Here, peptoid nanotubes functionalized with a panel of solid&#8208;binding proteins are used to mineralize homogeneously distributed and monodisperse anatase nanocrystals from the water&#8208;soluble TiBALDH precursor. Crystallite size is systematically tuned between 1.4 and 4.4 nm by changing protein coverage and the identity and valency of the genetically engineered solid&#8208;binding segments. The approach is extended to the synthesis of gold nanoparticles and, using a protein encoding both material&#8208;binding specificities, to the fabrication of&#160;titania/gold nanocomposites capable of photocatalysis under visible&#8208;light illumination. Beyond uncovering critical roles for hierarchical organization and denticity on solid&#8208;binding protein mineralization outcomes, the strategy described herein should prove valuable for the fabrication of hierarchical hybrid materials incorporating a broad range of inorganic components.

         <title>Tailored Polypeptide Star Copolymers for 3D Printing of Bacterial Composites Via Direct Ink Writing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 3, January 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D printing of biocompatible hydrogel networks based on the self&#8208;assembly of 3&#8208;arm polypeptide stars permits the additive manufacturing of &#8220;living&#8221; objects. In this work, the design of the 3&#8208;arm block copolypeptide stars allows for tuning of mechanical properties and printing performance while also directly impacting the proliferation, activity, and colony formation of embedded Escherichia coli.








Abstract
Hydrogels hold much promise for 3D printing of functional living materials; however, challenges remain in tailoring mechanical robustness as well as biological performance. In addressing this challenge, the modular synthesis of functional hydrogels from 3&#8208;arm diblock copolypeptide stars composed of an inner poly(l&#8208;glutamate) domain and outer poly(l&#8208;tyrosine) or poly(l&#8208;valine) blocks is described. Physical crosslinking due to &#223;&#8208;sheet assembly of these star block copolymers gives mechanical stability during extrusion printing and the selective incorporation of methacrylate units allows for subsequent photocrosslinking to occur under biocompatible conditions. This permits direct ink writing (DIW) printing of bacteria&#8208;based mixtures leading to 3D objects with high fidelity and excellent bacterial viability. The tunable stiffness of different copolypeptide networks enables control over proliferation and colony formation for embedded Escherichia coli bacteria as demonstrated via isopropyl &#223;&#8208;d&#8208;1&#8208;thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) induction of green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression. This translation of molecular structure to network properties highlights the versatility of these polypeptide hydrogel systems with the combination of writable structures and biological activity illustrating the future potential of these 3D&#8208;printed biocomposites.

&lt;p&gt;3D printing of biocompatible hydrogel networks based on the self-assembly of 3-arm polypeptide stars permits the additive manufacturing of &#8220;living&#8221; objects. In this work, the design of the 3-arm block copolypeptide stars allows for tuning of mechanical properties and printing performance while also directly impacting the proliferation, activity, and colony formation of embedded &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;.

         <title>Zwitterions Narrow Distribution of Perovskite Quantum Wells for Blue Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Efficiency Exceeding 15%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 3, January 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a facile strategy base on bifunctional zwitterions is proposed that effectively modulates the crystallization kinetics of quantum wells&#8212;both suppressing the formation of low&#8208;n phases and restricting the growth of high&#8208;n phases&#8212;contributing to a narrow n distribution. Accordingly, high&#8208;performance sky&#8208;blue PeLEDs at 490&#160;nm with a recorded EQE of 15.6% are realized.








Abstract
While quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional (quasi&#8208;2D) perovskites have emerged as promising semiconductors for light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), the broad&#8208;width distribution of quantum wells hinders their efficient energy transfer and electroluminescence performance in blue emission. In particular, the underlying mechanism is closely related to the crystallization kinetics and has yet to be understood. Here for the first time, the influence of bifunctional zwitterions with different coordination affinity on the crystallization kinetics of quasi&#8208;2D perovskites is systematically investigated. The zwitterions can coordinate with Pb2+ and also act as co&#8208;spacer organic species in quasi&#8208;2D perovskites, which collectively inhibit the aggregation of colloidal precursors and shorten the distance of quantum wells. Consequently, restricted nucleation of high&#8208;n phases and promoted growth of low&#8208;n phases are achieved with moderately coordinated zwitterions, leading to the final film with a more concentrated n distribution and improved energy transfer efficiency. It thus enables high&#8208;efficiency blue LEDs with a recorded external quantum efficiency of 15.6% at 490&#160;nm, and the operation stability has also been prolonged to 55.3&#160;min. These results provide useful directions for tuning the crystallization kinetics of quasi&#8208;2D perovskites, which is expected to lead to high&#8208;performance perovskite LEDs.

         <title>A Smart &#8220;Energy NanoLock&#8221; Selectively Blocks Oral Cancer Energy Metabolism through Synergistic Inhibition of Exogenous Nutrient Supply and Endogenous Energy Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 3, January 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A smart responsive &#8220;Energy NanoLock&#8221; is developed to improve oral cancer metabolic intervention. NanoLock is a pomegranate&#8208;like nanocomplex of cyclicRGD&#8208;modified carboxymethyl chitosan encapsulating indocyanine green and apoptotic peptides functionalized gold nanoparticles, which together form a dual pH&#8208; and photoresponsive therapeutic platform. NanoLock can simultaneously inhibit nutrient supply and energy production, resulting in effectively eliminating tumors while preserving oral functions.








Abstract
The major challenge in oral cancer is the lack of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art treatment modality that effectively cures cancer while preserving oral functions. Recent insights into tumor metabolic dependency provide a therapeutic opportunity for exploring optimal treatment approaches. Herein, a smart responsive &#8220;Energy NanoLock&#8221; is developed to improve cancer metabolic intervention by simultaneously inhibiting nutrient supply and energy production. NanoLock is a pomegranate&#8208;like nanocomplex of cyclicRGD&#8208;modified carboxymethyl chitosan (CyclicRC, pI = 6.7) encapsulating indocyanine green and apoptotic peptides functionalized gold nanoparticles (IK&#8208;AuNPs), which together form a dual pH&#8208; and photoresponsive therapeutic platform. NanoLock exhibits good stability under physiological conditions, but releases small&#8208;size CyclicRC and IK&#8208;AuNPs in response to the tumor acidic microenvironment, leading to deep tumor penetration. CyclicRC targets integrins to inhibit tumor angiogenesis, and consequently blocks tumor nutrient supply. Meanwhile, IK&#8208;AuNPs specifically induce apoptotic peptides and photothermally mediated mitochondrial collapse, and consequently inhibits endogenous energy production, thereby facilitating cell death. Importantly, in both xenograft and orthotopic oral cancer models, NanoLock selectively eliminates tumors with little cross&#8208;reactivity with normal tissues, especially oral functions, resulting in prolonged survival of mice. Therefore, NanoLock provides a novel metabolic therapy to exploit synergistic inhibition of exogenous nutrient supply and endogenous energy production, which potentially advances oral cancer treatment.

         <title>Local Electric Field Promoted Kinetics and Interfacial Stability of a Phosphorus Anode with Ionic Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 3, January 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cationic covalent organic framework creates a local electric field to regulate the reaction process of phosphorus anode. The local electric field can confine the soluble intermediate lithium polyphosphide species, change the electronic structure of polyphosphide anions to accelerate the reaction kinetics, and induce the generation of stable and tough SEI for long cycling stability.








Abstract
A phosphorus anode is a promising option for energy&#8208;storage applications because of its high theoretical specific capacity and safe lithiation potential. However, the multiphase phosphorus lithiation/delithiation reactions and soluble reaction intermediates cause sluggish reaction kinetics and loss of&#160;active materials. Herein, a novel local electric field (LEF) strategy is proposed to inhibit the intermediates dissolution and promote the reaction kinetics by optimizing ionic covalent organic frameworks (iCOFs). Among them, the LEF induced by the cationic covalent organic framework effectively enhances the electrochemical performance of the phosphorus anode. The strong electrostatic interaction between the polyphosphides and cationic covalent organic framework confines the dissolution of active materials and tailors the electronic structure of polyphosphides to accelerate the reaction kinetics. The cationic covalent&#8208;organic&#8208;framework&#8208;assisted phosphorus anode provides a high capacity of 1227.8 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10.4 A g&#8722;1 (8.6 C) and a high&#8208;capacity retention of 87% after 500 cycles at 1.3 A g&#8722;1. This work not only broadens the application of iCOFs for phosphorus anode but also inspires the great potential of the local electric field in battery technology.

         <title>Unraveling the Stretch&#8208;Induced Microstructural Evolution and Morphology&#8211;Stretchability Relationships of High&#8208;Performance Ternary Organic Photovoltaic Blends</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 3, January 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multiscale morphology and stretch&#8208;induced microstructural evolution of the high&#8208;efficiency ternary organic solar cell blends are probed in real&#8208;time with multiple synchrotron X&#8208;ray scattering techniques. The morphology&#8211;stretchability relations are established with stretchable metrics being predictable. This work sets a methodology for uncovering the regulation mechanisms of morphology, mechanics, and performance of stretchable organic electronics.








Abstract
The stretchability and stretch&#8208;induced structural evolution of organic solar cells (OSCs) are pivotal for their collapsible, portable, and wearable applications, and they are mainly affected by the complex morphology of active layers. Herein, a highly ductile conjugated polymer P(NDI2OD&#8208;T2) is incorporated into the active layers of high&#8208;efficiency OSCs based on nonfullerene small molecule acceptors to simultaneously investigate the morphological, mechanical, and photovoltaic properties and structural evolution under stretching of ternary blend films with various acceptor contents. The structural robustness of the blend films is indicated by their stretch&#8208;induced structural evolution, which is monitored in real&#8208;time by a combination of in situ wide/small angle X&#8208;ray scattering. It is found that adding the soft P(NDI2OD&#8208;T2) can enhance the stretchability and structural robustness of ternary blend films by more entangled chains and tie chains to dissipate strain. Furthermore, the stretchability of the ternary blends can be superbly predicted by a 3D equivalent box model. This work provides instructive insight and guidance for designing stretchable electronics and predicting the stretchability of multicomponent blends.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stretchability and stretch-induced structural evolution of organic solar cells (OSCs) are pivotal for their collapsible, portable, and wearable applications, and they are mainly affected by the complex morphology of active layers. Herein, a highly ductile conjugated polymer P(NDI2OD-T2) is incorporated into the active layers of high-efficiency OSCs based on nonfullerene small molecule acceptors to simultaneously investigate the morphological, mechanical, and photovoltaic properties and structural evolution under stretching of ternary blend films with various acceptor contents. The structural robustness of the blend films is indicated by their stretch-induced structural evolution, which is monitored in real-time by a combination of in situ wide/small angle X-ray scattering. It is found that adding the soft P(NDI2OD-T2) can enhance the stretchability and structural robustness of ternary blend films by more entangled chains and tie chains to dissipate strain. Furthermore, the stretchability of the ternary blends can be superbly predicted by a 3D equivalent box model. This work provides instructive insight and guidance for designing stretchable electronics and predicting the stretchability of multicomponent blends.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Taming Solvent&#8211;Solute Interaction Accelerates Interfacial Kinetics in Low&#8208;Temperature Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 3, January 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Desolvation is validated as the predominant contributor to energy loss at low temperatures, largely overwhelming the contributions from other interfacial ion transportation processes. A rational and original design by taming solvent&#8211;solute interaction with low&#8208;affinity solvents like 1,3&#8208;dioxolane is proposed to enable high capacity and durable operation of practical lithium&#8208;metal batteries at &#8722;40 &#176;C.








Abstract
Lithium (Li)&#8208;metal batteries promise energy density beyond 400 Wh kg&#8722;1, while their practical operation at an extreme temperature below &#8722;30 &#176;C suffers severe capacity deterioration. Such battery failure highly relates to the remarkably increased kinetic barrier of interfacial processes, including interfacial desolvation, ion transportation, and charge transfer. In this work, the interfacial kinetics in three prototypical electrolytes are quantitatively probed by three&#8208;electrode electrochemical techniques and molecular dynamics simulations. Desolvation as the limiting step of interfacial processes is validated to dominate the cell impedance and capacity at low temperature. 1,3&#8208;Dioxolane&#8208;based electrolyte with tamed solvent&#8211;solute interaction facilitates fast desolvation, enabling the practical Li|LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 cells at &#8722;40 &#176;C to retain 66% of room&#8208;temperature capacity and withstand remarkably fast charging rate (0.3 C). The barrier of desolvation dictated by solvent&#8211;solute interaction environments is quantitatively uncovered. Regulating the solvent&#8211;solute interaction by low&#8208;affinity solvents emerges as a promising solution to low&#8208;temperature batteries.

         <title>Reducing Trap Density in Organic Solar Cells via Extending the Fused Ring Donor Unit of an A&#8211;D&#8211;A&#8208;Type Nonfullerene Acceptor for Over 17% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 3, January 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extending the donor core in a nonfullerene acceptor (NFA) is applied to suppress trap states in organic solar cells (OSCs). TTPIC&#8208;4F with an extended core exhibits higher crystallinity than BTPIC&#8208;4F. Thus, D18:TTPIC&#8208;4F&#8208;based OSCs afford a lower trap density of 4.02&#160;&#215;&#160;1015&#160;cm&#8722;3 for higher mobility and reduced &#916;Enr, and achieve an impressive PCE of 17.1%, which is the record for A&#8211;D&#8211;A&#8208;type NFAs.








Abstract
The high trap density (generally 1016 to 1018&#160;cm&#8722;3) in thin films of organic semiconductors is the primary reason for the inferior charge&#8208;carrier mobility and large nonradiative recombination energy loss (&#916;Enr) in organic solar cells (OSCs), limiting improvement in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). In this study, the trap density in OSCs is efficiently reduced via extending the donor core of nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) from a heptacyclic unit to a nonacyclic unit. TTPIC&#8208;4F with a nonacyclic unit has stronger intramolecular and intermolecular interactions, affording higher crystallinity in thin films relative to its counterpart BTPIC&#8208;4F. Thus, the D18:TTPIC&#8208;4F&#8208;based device achieves a lower trap density of 4.02&#160;&#215;&#160;1015&#160;cm&#8722;3, comparable to some typical high&#8208;performance inorganic/hybrid semiconductors, with higher mobility and inhibited charge&#8208;carrier recombination in devices. Therefore, the D18:TTPIC&#8208;4F&#8208;based OSC exhibits an impressive PCE of 17.1% with a low &#916;Enr of 0.208&#160;eV, which is the best known value for A&#8211;D&#8211;A&#8208;type NFAs. Therefore, extending the donor core of NFAs is an efficient method for suppressing trap states in OSCs for high PCEs.

         <title>Precise Functionalization of a Multiple&#8208;Resonance Framework: Constructing Narrowband Organic Electroluminescent Materials with External Quantum Efficiency over 40%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 3, January 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic methodology is implemented for functionalizing brominated B&#63743;N&#8208;containing multiple&#8208;resonance framework with multifarious electron groups, such as donors, acceptors, and moieties without obvious push&#8211;pull electron properties. The optimized m&#8208;DPAcP&#8211;BNCz&#8208;based organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) exhibits green emission with a full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 28 nm and a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 40.6%.








Abstract
It is of important strategic significance to develop high&#8208;efficiency narrowband organic electroluminescent materials that can be employed to fabricate ultrahigh&#8208;definition displays with wide color gamut. This topic implies a great challenge to molecular design and synthesis, especially for the development of universality, diversity, scalability, and robustness of molecular architectonics. In this work, a synthetic methodology is demonstrated for functionalizing brominated B&#63743;N&#8208;containing multiple&#8208;resonance (MR) frameworks with multifarious functional groups, such as donors, acceptors, and moieties without obvious push&#8211;pull electron properties. The m&#8208;DPAcP&#8211;BNCz&#8208;based organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) exhibits green emission with a full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 28&#160;nm and a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 40.6%. The outstanding performance of m&#8208;DPAcP&#8211;BNCz is attributed to the perfect integration of the inherent advantages of the MR framework and the donor&#8211;acceptor configuration, which can not only achieve bathochromic shift and narrowband emission, but also obtain high photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield (&#934;PL) and horizontal emitting dipole orientation ratio (&#920;//). This straightforward and efficient approach provides insightful guidance for the construction and enrichment of more high&#8208;efficiency narrowband emitters.

SrRuO3 Thin Films
The perovskite SrRuO3 is a prototypical itinerant ferromagnet that has drawn considerable attention due to its strongly correlated physical properties. In article number 2207246, Hyeon Han, Stuart S. P. Parkin, and co&#8208;workers use the hydrogen spillover technique to modify the structure and magnetic properties and induce a reversal in sign of the anomalous Hall effect in SrRuO3 thin films, as revealed by comprehensive in situ experiments and density functional theory calculations.

Electron Correlation
In article number 2205698, David Maximilian Janas, Andrea Droghetti, Giovanni Zamborlini, and co&#8208;workers use state&#8208;of&#8208;the art photoemission spectroscopy and theoretical methods to unravel the origin of enhanced electron correlation at the interface between iron and an oxygen adsorbate layer. Since the degree of correlation is controlled by interface charge transfer, it can be easily engineered by selecting different adsorbates. This strategy could allow the design of low&#8208;dimensional materials in yet&#8208;unexplored intermediate correlated regimes. Image credit: Mira Sophie Arndt.

Self&#8208;Assembled Nanodomains
In article number 2207338, Jang Hwan Kim, Hyeong Min Jin, Jaeup U. Kim, Sang Ouk Kim, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate the realization of sub&#8208;10&#8208;nm scale nanopatterns that are remarkably well aligned along the atomic edge of 2D flakes. Self&#8208;assembled nanodomains are elucidated based on alternation of the wetting layer of the BCP film in the presence of intermediate 2D flakes. This novel approach highlights the synergistic integration of bottom&#8208;up nanofabrication.

         <title>Progress and Perspectives of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Gas Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 3, January 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gas sensors are widely used in many areas. Compared to the traditional sensing materials including semiconductors, nanomaterials, and 2D materials, the emerging single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) show great potential owing to the maximum atom utilization and unique chemical and physical properties. This work timely summarizes the recent progress and provides future perspectives on the SACs sensing.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) attract extensive attention in the field of heterogeneous catalysis in recent years due to the maximum atom utilization and unique physical and chemical properties. The gas sensing is actually a heterogeneous catalysis process but the SACs are new to this area. Although SACs show huge potential in gas sensing, the SACs gas sensing area currently is still at the infancy stage. This work critically reviews the recent advances and current status of single&#8208;atom gas sensing materials. General synthesis routes, characterization methods, and sensing performance indexes are introduced. At the end, the challenges and future prospects on SACs gas sensing are presented from the authors&#8217; perspectives. This work is anticipated to provide insights and guideline for the chemical sensing community.

         <title>Recent Advances in Ultrathin Chiral Metasurfaces by Twisted Stacking</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 3, January 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple twisted stacking of two layers of nanomaterials can produce ultrathin planarized nanostructures with optical chirality. This review thoroughly examines the recent progress in ultrathin chiroptical metasurfaces prepared through chiral stacking, discussing the monolayer materials, fabrication strategies, and the induced circular dichroism. A special focus is placed on the flexible tunability of the chiroptical responses and relevant optical applications.








Abstract
Artificial chiral nanostructures have been subjected to extensive research for their unique chiroptical activities. Planarized chiral films of ultrathin thicknesses are in particular demand for easy on&#8208;chip integration and improved energy efficiency as polarization&#8208;sensitive metadevices. Recently, controlled twisted stacking of two or more layers of nanomaterials, such as 2D van der Waals materials, ultrathin films, or traditional metasurfaces, at an angle has emerged as a general strategy to introduce optical chirality into achiral solid&#8208;state systems. This method endows new degrees of freedom, e.g., the interlayer twist angle, to flexibly engineer and tune the chiroptical responses without having to change the material or the design, thus greatly facilitating the development of multifunctional metamaterials. In this review, recent exciting progress in planar chiral metasurfaces are summarized and discussed from the viewpoints of building blocks, fabrication methods, as well as circular dichroism and modulation thereof in twisted stacked nanostructures. The review further highlights the ever&#8208;growing portfolio of applications of these chiral metasurfaces, including polarization conversion, information encryption, chiral sensing, and as an engineering platform for hybrid metadevices. Finally, forward&#8208;looking prospects are provided.

Recently, how to suppress the loss of polymer&#8208;based dielectrics has been increasingly recognized as a critical point to attain a high charge&#8211;discharge efficiency in the film capacitors. Some achievements are made in analyzing the source of loss and suppressing loss via Edison's trial and error method. In this review, the significance of suppressing loss in polymer&#8208;based dielectrics is firstly emphasized. Then, different sources of loss are discussed carefully and an in&#8208;depth analysis of the related measurements is presented. Next, recent research results in suppressing loss are summarized and discussed in detail according to different strategies. Finally, the challenges and opportunities in the loss suppression research for the rational design of high&#8208;efficiency polymer&#8208;based dielectrics are proposed.

         <title>Construction of Fluorinated Propane&#8208;Trap in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Record Polymer&#8208;grade Propylene Production under High Humidity Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Propane/propene (C3H8/C3H6) separation is essential in the petrochemical industry but challenging because of their similar physical and chemical properties. Adsorptive separation with C3H8&#8208;selective porous materials can energy&#8208;efficient produce high&#8208;purity C3H6, which is highly promising for replacing conventional cryogenic distillation but suffers from unsatisfactory performance. Herein, through the precise introduction of fluorinated functional groups into the confined pore space, a new fluorinated MOF (FDMOF&#8208;2) featuring the unique strong C3H8&#8208;trap was successfully constructed. FDMOF&#8208;2 exhibit an unprecedented C3H8 capture capacity of 140 cm3 cm&#8722;3 and excellent C3H8/C3H6 (1:1, v/v) selectivity up to 2.18 (298 K and 1&#160;bar), thus setting new benchmarks for all reported porous materials. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies reveal that the tailor&#8208;made pore confinement in FDMOF&#8208;2 provided stronger and multiple attractive interactions with C3H8, enabling excellent binding affinities. Breakthrough experiments demonstrate that C3H8 can be directly extracted from various C3H8/C3H6 mixtures through FDMOF&#8208;2, affording an outstanding C3H6 production (501&#160;mmol L&#8722;1) with over 99.99% purity. Benefiting from the robust framework and hydrophobic ligands, the separation performance of FDMOF&#8208;2 can be well maintained even under 70% relative humidity conditions. The exceptional propylene separation productivity and ultrahigh structural stability make this MOF material a very promising candidate for this challenging separation process.

         <title>Hydration Activates Dual&#8208;Confined Shape Memory Effects of Cold&#8208;Reprogrammable Photonic Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Shape memory photonic crystals (SMPCs) transform the nanoscale deformation of copolymers into structural colors through an undifferentiated response to stimuli, however, activatable selective responses are extremely rare. Herein, activatable dual confined shape memory effects (CSMEs) derived from the remodeling of the interchain hydrogen bonds (H&#8208;bonds) in cold&#8208;programmable SMPCs were revealed. The first level is the water&#8208;triggered interchain H&#8208;bonds reconstruction, which can activate/lock the collapsed skeleton, showing shape recovery/retention in response to ethanol vapor. The second level is the pressure&#8208;induced interchain H&#8208;bonds reorganization that results in the recovered skeleton being locked even when exposed to ethanol vapor or water, while the background porous structure can switch between collapse and recovery. Dual CSMEs result from the Laplace pressure difference and the binding effect of interchain H&#8208;bonds in the skeleton according to insights of swelling, in&#8208;situ deformation tracking, multi&#8208;dimensional infrared spectra, and water wetting/evaporation simulations. The signal interference, source code extraction, and color enhancement of structurally colored patterns can be implemented using CSMEs. This work opens up a new method for fabricating activatable responsive structural colors and contributes to the expansion of nanophotonic technology in water printing, erasable watermarks, signal amplifiers, and information coding.

         <title>Embedded 3D Printing of Architected Ceramics via Microwave&#8208;activated Polymerization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Light&#8208; and ink&#8208;based 3D printing (3DP) methods have vastly expanded the design space and geometric complexity of architected ceramics. However, light&#8208;based methods are typically confined to a relatively narrow range of preceramic and particle&#8208;laden resins, while ink&#8208;based methods are limited in geometric complexity due to layerwise assembly.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light- and ink-based 3D printing (3DP) methods have vastly expanded the design space and geometric complexity of architected ceramics. However, light-based methods are typically confined to a relatively narrow range of preceramic and particle-laden resins, while ink-based methods are limited in geometric complexity due to layerwise assembly. Here, we&#160;combine embedded 3D (EMB3D) printing with microwave-activated curing to generate architected ceramics with spatially controlled composition in freeform shapes. Aqueous colloidal inks are printed within a support matrix, rapidly cured via microwave-activated polymerization, and subsequently dried and sintered into dense architectures composed of one or more oxide materials. Our&#160;integrated manufacturing method opens new avenues for the design and fabrication of complex ceramic architectures with programmed composition, density, and form for myriad applications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Moisture Enabled Electricity from Hygroscopic Materials: A New Type of Clean Energy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The water utilization is accompanied with the development of human beings. Whereas, the gaseous moisture is usually regarded as underexploited resources. The advances of highly&#8208;efficient hygroscopic materials endow the atmospheric water harvesting an intriguing solution to convert moisture into clean water. The discovery of hygroelectricity, which refers to the charge build&#8208;up at material surface dependent on humidity, and the following moisture enabled electric generation (MEG) realizes the energy conversion and directly output electricity. Much progress has been made since then to optimize the MEG performance, pushing forward the applications of MEG into practical level. Herein, the evolvement and development of MEG are systematically summarized in a chronological order. The optimization strategies of MEG are discussed and comprehensively evaluated. Then, the latest applications of MEG are presented, including high&#8208;performance powering units and self&#8208;powered devices. In the end, a perspective on the future development of MEG is given for inspiring more researchers into this promising area.

         <title>A Physiologically Responsive Nanocomposite Hydrogel for Treatment of Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma via Proteolysis&#8208;targeting Chimeras Enhanced Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Although immunotherapy has revolutionized oncotherapy, only &#8764;15% of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients benefit from the current therapies. An immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and dysregulation of the polycomb ring finger oncogene BMI1 are potential reasons for the failure. Herein, to promote immunotherapeutic efficacy against HNSCC, we developed an injectable nanocomposite hydrogel with a polymer framework (PLGA&#8208;PEG&#8208;PLGA) that is loaded with both imiquimod encapsulated CaCO3 nanoparticles (RC) and cancer cell membrane (CCM) coated mesoporous silica nanoparticles containing a peptide&#8208;based proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTAC) for BMI1 and paclitaxel (PepM@PacC). Upon injection, this nanocomposite hydrogel undergoes in situ gelation, after which it degrades in the TME over time, releasing RC and PepM@PacC nanoparticles to respectively perform immunotherapy and chemotherapy. Specifically, the RC particles selectively manipulate tumor&#8208;associated macrophages and dendritic cells to activate a T&#8208;cell immune response, while CCM&#8208;mediated homologous targeting and endocytosis delivers the PepM@PacC particles into cancer cells, where endogenous glutathione promotes disulfide bond cleavage to release the PROTAC peptide for BMI1 degradation and frees the paclitaxel from the particle pores to elicit apoptosis meanwhile enhance immunotherapy. Thus, our nanocomposite hydrogel, which was designed to exploit multiple known vulnerabilities of HNSCC, succeeds in suppressing both growth and metastasis of HNSCC.

         <title>Superfast Mass Transport of Na/K Via Mesochannels for Dendrite&#8208;Free Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Fast ion diffusion in anode hosts enabling uniform distribution of Li/Na/K is essential for achieving dendrite&#8208;free alkali metal batteries. Common strategies, e.g. expanding the interlayer spacing of anode materials, can enhance bulk diffusion of Li, but are less efficient for Na and K due to their larger ionic radius. Herein, we propose a universal strategy to drastically improve the mass transport efficiency of Na/K by introducing open mesochannels in carbon hosts. Such pore engineering can increase the accessible surface area by one order of magnitude, thus remarkably accelerating the surface diffusion, as visualized by in&#8208;situ transmission electron microscopy. In particular, once the mesochannels are filled by Na/K metals, they become the superfast channels for mass transport via the mechanism of interfacial diffusion. Thus&#8208;modified carbon hosts enable Na/K filling in their inner cavities and uniform deposition across the whole electrodes with fast kinetics. The resulting Na metal anodes can exhibit stable dendrite&#8208;free cycling with outstanding rate performance at high current density up to 30&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. This work presents an inspiring attempt to address the sluggish transport issue of Na/K, as well as valuable insights into the mass transport mechanism in porous anodes for high&#8208;performance alkali metal storage.

         <title>Orthogonal Photo&#8208;chemistry Towards Direct Encryption of a 3D Printed Hydrogel</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Encryption technologies are essential for information security and product anti&#8208;counterfeiting, but they are typically restricted to planar surfaces. Encryption on complex 3D objects offers great potential to further improve security. However, it is rarely achieved owing to the lack of encoding strategies for non&#8208;planar surfaces. Here, we report an approach to directly encrypt on a 3D printed object employing orthogonal photo&#8208;chemistry. In this system, visible light photo&#8208;chemistry is used for 3D printing of a hydrogel and ultraviolet light is subsequently employed to activate its geometrically complex surface through the dissociation of ortho&#8208;nitrobenzyl ester units in a spatio&#8208;selective manner for information coding. Our approach offers a new way for more reliable encryption and the underlying orthogonal photo&#8208;chemistry can be extended towards functional modification of 3D printed products beyond information protection.

Abstract
Immunotherapy has achieved revolutionary success in clinics, but it remains challenging for treating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) characterized by high vascularization. Here, we reported that metal&#8208;organic framework&#8208;801 (MOF&#8208;801) could be employed as stimulator of interferon genes (STING) through Toll&#8208;like receptor 4 (TLR4) not just a drug delivery carrier. Notably, cytosine&#8208;phosphate&#8208;guanine oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG ODNs) and 5, 6&#8208;dimethylxanthenone&#8208;4&#8208;acetic acid (DMXAA) STING agonist with vascular disrupting function could coordinate with MOF&#8208;801 to self&#8208;assemble into a nanoparticle (MOF&#8208;CpG&#8208;DMXAA) that effectively delivered CpG ODNs and DMXAA to cells for synergistically improving the tumour microenvironment by reprogramming tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs), promoting dendritic cells (DCs) maturation as well as destroying tumour blood vessels. In HCC&#8208;bearing mouse models, we demonstrated that MOF&#8208;CpG&#8208;DMXAA triggered systemic immune activation and stimulated robust tumoricidal immunity, resulting in a superior immunotherapeutic efficiency in orthotopic and recurrent HCC.

         <title>Polymorphic Memtransistor with Tunable Metallic and Semiconducting Channel</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Modulating semiconducting channel potential has been used for electrical switching in transistors without biological plasticity operations that are critical for energy&#8208;efficient neuromorphic computing. To achieve efficient data processing, alternative transport mechanisms, such as tunneling and thermionic emission, have been introduced with two&#8208;dimensional materials. Here, we report on a polymorphic memtransistor based on atomically&#8208;thin Mo0.91W0.09Te2, where the lattice and electronic structures of the lateral device channel can be tuned as either metallic (1T&#8217;) or semiconducting (2H) phases by electrical gating. The structural and electronic phase change of the channel material, optimized in Mo0.91W0.09Te2, was explored using transport and optical measurements at the device scale. Based on the phase transition, our polymorphic memtransistor demonstrates a high on/off ratio (up to 105), low subthreshold swing (down to 80&#160;mV/dec), and various memristive behaviors, which are distinguished from traditional phase change memory, transistors, and passive memristors for diverse neuromorphic and in&#8208;memory computing.

Here, we report on a polymorphic memtransistor based on atomically-thin Mo&lt;sub&gt;0.91&lt;/sub&gt;W&lt;sub&gt;0.09&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, where the lattice and electronic structures of the lateral device channel can be tuned as either metallic (1T&#8217;) or semiconducting (2H) phases by electrical gating. The structural and electronic phase change of the channel material, optimized in Mo&lt;sub&gt;0.91&lt;/sub&gt;W&lt;sub&gt;0.09&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, was explored using transport and optical measurements at the device scale. Based on the phase transition, our polymorphic memtransistor demonstrates a high on/off ratio (up to 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;), low subthreshold swing (down to 80&#160;mV/dec), and various memristive behaviors, which are distinguished from traditional phase change memory, transistors, and passive memristors for diverse neuromorphic and in-memory computing.&lt;/p&gt;

Abstract
Metamaterials are artificial materials in which the atoms of ordinary solids are replaced by tailored functional building blocks. Therefore, previous work has emphasized tailoring the inside of the building blocks, for example by exploiting local resonances, to realize unusual effective metamaterial properties. However, the wave properties of a metamaterial are not only determined by its building blocks but also by the interactions between these building blocks. Here, reconfigurable &#8220;plug&#8208;and&#8208;play&#8221; electromagnetic metamaterials are introduced for which the building blocks are essentially trivial standard BNC connectors and the effective metamaterial properties are solely achieved by tailoring the local and especially the nonlocal interactions mediated by standard coaxial cables. Unprecedented dispersion relations of the lowest band with multiple regions of slow waves and backward waves are demonstrated. Importantly, the dispersion relation of such metamaterials dominated by nonlocal interactions is not limited by the principle of causality in the same way as for metamaterials designed by local resonances of building blocks.

         <title>Nanoimprinted 2D&#8208;chiral Perovskite Nanocrystal Metasurfaces for Circularly Polarized Photoluminescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The versatile hybrid perovskite nanocrystals are one of the most promising materials for optoelectronics in virtue of their tunable bandgaps and high photoluminescence quantum yields. However, their inherent crystalline chemical structure limits the chiroptical properties achievable with the material. The production of chiral perovskites has become an active field of research for its promising applications in optics, chemistry or biology. Typically, chiral halide perovskites are obtained by the incorporation of different chiral moieties in the material. Unfortunately, these chemically modified perovskites have demonstrated moderate values of chiral photoluminescence so far. Here we introduce a general and scalable approach to produce chiral photoluminescence from arbitrary nano&#8208;emitters assembled into 2D&#8208;chiral metasurfaces. The fabrication via nanoimprinting lithography employs elastomeric molds engraved with chiral motifs covering millimeter areas that are used to pattern two types of unmodified colloidal perovskite nanocrystal inks: green&#8208;emissive CsPbBr3 and red&#8208;emissive CsPbBr1I2. The perovskite 2D&#8208;metasurfaces exhibit remarkable photoluminescence dissymmetry factors (glum) of 0.16 that can be further improved up to glum of 0.3 by adding a high refractive index coating on the metasurfaces. This scalable approach to produce chiral photoluminescent thin films paves the way for the seamless production of bright chiral light sources for upcoming optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Sound&#8208;speed Modifying Acoustic Metasurfaces for Acoustic Holography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Acoustic metasurfaces offer unique capabilities to steer and direct acoustic fields, though these are generally comprised of complex 3D structures, complicating their fabrication and applicability to higher frequencies. Here, we demonstrate an ultrathin metasurface approach utilizing planarized micropillars in a discretized phase array. This sub&#8208;wavelength metasurface is easily produced via a single&#8208;step etching process and is suitable for MHz&#8208;scale applications. We further demonstrate the flexibility of this metasurface approach in the production of complex acoustic patterns via acoustic holography. This metasurface approach, with models used to predict their behavior, has broad potential in applications where robust, high&#8208;frequency acoustic manipulation is required, including microfluidics, cell/tissue engineering and medical ultrasound.

         <title>Vanadium Oxide&#8208;Doped Laser&#8208;Induced Graphene Multi&#8208;Parameter Sensor to Decouple Soil Nitrogen Loss and Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Monitoring nitrogen utilization efficiency and soil temperature in agricultural systems for timely intervention is essential to monitor crop health, promote sustainable and precision agriculture, and reduce environmental pollution. Therefore, it is of vital significance to develop a multi&#8208;parameter sensor for effectively and accurately decoupled detection of nitrogen loss and soil temperature, which is yet to be reported. Herein, this work presents a high&#8208;performance multi&#8208;parameter sensor based on vanadium oxide (VOX)&#8208;doped laser&#8208;induced graphene (LIG) foam to completely decouple nitrogen oxides (NOX) and temperature. By exploiting the laser&#8208;assisted synthesis, the highly porous 3D VOX&#8208;doped LIG foam composite is readily obtained by laser scribing vanadium sulfide (V5S8)&#8208;doped block copolymer and phenolic resin self&#8208;assembled films. Compared with the intrinsic LIG, the heterojunction formed at the LIG/VOX interface provides the sensor with a significantly enhanced response to NOX, and an ultralow limit of detection (LOD) of 3 ppb (theoretical estimate of 451 ppt) at room temperature. The sensor also exhibits a wide detection range (from 3 ppb to 5&#160;ppm), fast response/recovery (217/650 s to 1&#160;ppm NO2), good selectivity (ten&#8208;fold response to NO2 over other interfering gases), and stability over 16 days. Meanwhile, the sensor can accurately detect temperature over a wide linear range of 10&#8211;110&#176;C with a small detection limit of 0.2&#176;C. The encapsulation of the sensor with a soft membrane further allows for temperature sensing without being affected by NOX, presenting an effective strategy to decouple nitrogen loss and soil temperature for accurate soil environmental monitoring. The sensor without encapsulation but operated at elevated temperature removes the influences of ambient relative humidity and temperature variations for accurate NOX measurements. The capability to simultaneously detect ultra&#8208;low NOX concentrations and small temperature changes paves the way for the development of future multimodal electronic devices with decoupled sensing mechanisms for health monitoring and precision agriculture.

         <title>Solution&#8208;processed Pure Red TADF Organic Light&#8208;emitting Diodes With High External Quantum Efficiency and Saturated Red Emission Color</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In spite of recent research progress in red thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters, highly efficient and solution&#8208;processable pure red TADF emitters are rarely reported. Most of the red TADF emitters reported to date were designed using a rigid acceptor unit which renders them insoluble and unsuitable for solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). To resolve this issue, we designed and synthesized a novel TADF emitter, 6,7&#8208;bis(4&#8208;(bis(4&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl)phenyl)amino)phenyl)&#8208;2,3&#8208;bis(4&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl)phenyl)quinoxaline&#8208;5,8&#8208;dicarbonitrile (tBuTPA&#8208;CNQx), to achieve high external quantum efficiency (EQE) and pure red emission in solution&#8208;processed device. The highly twisted donor&#8208;acceptor architecture and appropriate highest occupied molecular orbital/lowest unoccupied molecular orbital distribution lead to a very small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap of 0.07&#160;eV, high photoluminescence quantum yield of 92%, and short delayed fluorescence lifetime of 52.4 &#956;s. The peripheral t&#8208;butyl phenyl decorated quinoxaline acceptor unit and t&#8208;butyl protected triphenylamine donor unit were proven to be useful building blocks to improve solubility and minimize the intermolecular interaction for high efficiency. The solution processed OLED based on tBuTPA&#8208;CNQx achieved a high EQE of 16.7% with a pure red emission peak at 662&#160;nm, which is one of the highest EQE value reported till date in the solution processed pure red TADF OLEDs. Additionally, vacuum&#8208;processable OLED based on tBuTPA&#8208;CNQx exhibited a high EQE of 22.2% and negligible efficiency roll&#8208;off. The newly developed synthetic route may trigger the future design of highly efficient solution&#8208;processed pure red TADF emitters.

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Reaction Heterogeneity During Calcination of Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery Cathode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;temperature calcination used for Li&#8208;ion battery particle synthesis is chemically imaged. Various parallel and serial combinations of heterogeneous reactions, such as the thermal aerobic/anaerobic decomposition, Li2CO3 decomposition, Li2&#8208;O insertion/diffusion, and O2 insertion/diffusion, prevail during the calcination reaction. The anaerobic decomposition of the precursor core slows down Li2&#8208;O incorporation.








Abstract
During solid&#8208;state calcination, with increasing temperature, materials undergo complex phase transitions with heterogeneous solid&#8208;state reactions and mass transport. Precise control of the calcination chemistry is therefore crucial for synthesizing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides (LiNi1&#8208;x&#8208;yCoxMnyO2, NRNCM) as cathode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Although the battery performance depends on the chemical heterogeneity during NRNCM calcination, it has not yet been elucidated. Herein, through synchrotron&#8208;based X&#8208;ray, mass spectrometry microscopy, and structural analyses, it is revealed that the temperature&#8208;dependent reaction kinetics, the diffusivity of solid&#8208;state lithium sources, and the ambient oxygen control the local chemical compositions of the reaction intermediates within a calcined particle. Additionally, it is found that the variations in the reducing power of the transition metals (i.e., Ni, Co, and Mn) determine the local structures at the nanoscale. The investigation of the reaction mechanism via imaging analysis provides valuable information for tuning the calcination chemistry and developing high&#8208;energy/power density lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Dual Topology of Dirac Electron Transport and Photogalvanic Effect in Low&#8208;Dimensional Topological Insulator Superlattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stacking layer number&#8208;dependent electron structure, quantum properties, and circularly (linearly) polarized photogalvanic effect are assessed in the low&#8208;dimensional dual topological superlattices (TSLs) (Bi2Se3)&#8208;(Bi2/Bi2Se3)N. The results show that the surface electronic structure of the dual TSLs is highly tunable and well&#8208;regulated for quantum transport and photoexcitation, which shed light on engineering for opto&#8208;electronic/spintronic applications.








Abstract
Dual topological insulators, simultaneously protected by time&#8208;reversal symmetry and crystalline symmetry, open great opportunities to explore different symmetry&#8208;protected metallic surface states. However, the conventional dual topological states located on different facets hinder integration into planar opto&#8208;electronic/spintronic devices. Here, dual topological superlattices (TSLs) Bi2Se3&#8208;(Bi2/Bi2Se3)N with limited stacking layer number N are constructed. Angle&#8208;resolved photoelectron emission spectra of the TSLs identify the coexistence and adjustment of dual topological surface states on Bi2Se3 facet. The existence and tunability of spin&#8208;polarized dual&#8208;topological bands with N on Bi2Se3 facet result in an unconventionally weak antilocalization effect (WAL) with variable WAL coefficient &#945; (maximum close to 3/2) from quantum transport experiments. Most importantly, it is identified that the spin&#8208;polarized surface electrons from dual topological bands exhibit circularly and linearly polarized photogalvanic effect (CPGE and LPGE). It is anticipated that the stacked dual&#8208;topology and stacking layer number controlled bands evolution provide a platform for realizing intrinsic CPGE and LPGE. The results show that the surface electronic structure of the dual TSLs is highly tunable and well&#8208;regulated for quantum transport and photoexcitation, which shed light on engineering for opto&#8208;electronic/spintronic applications.

         <title>Macroscale Fabrication of Lightweight and Strong Porous Carbon Foams through Template&#8208;Coating Pair Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The manufacturing of low&#8208;density&#8208;high&#8208;strength carbon materials on a macroscopic length scale has a significant impact on the construction, packaging, and transportation industries. Presented herein is a tunable platform for macroscale fabrication of lightweight and strong pyrolytic carbon foams through template&#8208;coating pair design.








Abstract
Manufacturing of low&#8208;density&#8208;high&#8208;strength carbon foams can benefit the construction, transportation, and packaging industries. One successful route to lightweight and mechanically strong carbon foams involves pyrolysis of polymeric architectures, which is inevitably accompanied by drastic volumetric shrinkage (usually &gt;98%). As such, a challenge of these materials lies in maintaining bulk dimensions of building struts that span orders of magnitude difference in length scale from centimeters to nanometers. This work demonstrates fabrication of macroscale low&#8208;density&#8208;high&#8208;strength carbon foams that feature exceptional dimensional stability through pyrolysis of robust template&#8208;coating pairs. The template serves as the architectural blueprint and contains strength&#8208;imparting properties (e.g., high node density and small strut dimensions); it is composed of a low char&#8208;yielding porous polystyrene backbone with a high carbonization&#8208;onset temperature. The coating serves to imprint and transcribe the template architecture into pyrolytic carbon; it is composed of a high char&#8208;yielding conjugated polymer with a relatively low carbonization&#8208;onset temperature. The designed carbonization mismatch enables structural inheritance, while the decomposition mismatch affords hollow struts, minimizing density. The carbons synthesized through this new framework exhibit remarkable dimensional stability (&#8776;80% dimension retention; &#8776;50% volume retention) and some of the highest specific strengths (&#8776;0.13&#160;GPa g&#8722;1 cm3) among reported carbon foams derived from porous polymer templates.

         <title>Many&#8208;Body Correlations and Exciton Complexes in CsPbBr3 Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Many&#8208;body interactions in exciton complexes are crucial in many devices, for example, lasers, LEDs, and quantum light sources. Here, a combination of single quantum&#8208;dot photoluminescence spectroscopy at cryogenic temperatures and configuration&#8208;interaction calculations reveals the size&#8208;dependent binding energies of trions (7&#8211;17&#160;meV) and biexcitons (15&#8211;30&#160;meV) in CsPbBr3&#160;quantum dots.








Abstract
All&#8208;inorganic lead&#8208;halide perovskite (LHP) (CsPbX3, X&#160;=&#160;Cl, Br, I) quantum dots (QDs) have emerged as a competitive platform for classical light&#8208;emitting devices (in the weak light&#8211;matter interaction regime, e.g., LEDs and laser), as well as for devices exploiting strong light&#8211;matter interaction at room temperature. Many&#8208;body interactions and quantum correlations among photogenerated exciton complexes play an essential role, for example, by determining the laser threshold, the overall brightness of LEDs, and the single&#8208;photon purity in quantum light sources. Here, by combining cryogenic single&#8208;QD photoluminescence spectroscopy with configuration&#8208;interaction (CI) calculations, the size&#8208;dependent trion and biexciton binding energies are addressed. Trion binding energies increase from 7&#160;to 17&#160;meV for QD sizes decreasing from 30&#160;to 9&#160;nm, while the biexciton binding energies increase from 15&#160;to 30&#160;meV, respectively. CI calculations quantitatively corroborate the experimental results and suggest that the effective dielectric constant for biexcitons slightly deviates from the one of the single excitons, potentially as a result of coupling to the lattice in the multiexciton regime. The findings here provide a deep insight into the multiexciton properties in all&#8208;inorganic LHP QDs, essential for classical and quantum optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Conjugated Coordination Polymer as a New Platform for Efficient and Selective Electroreduction of Nitrate into Ammonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>

A general strategy for simultaneous enhancement of activity and selectivity toward nitrate electroreduction into ammonia (NRA) is demonstrated by utilizing Ni&#8208;based conjugated coordination polymer catalysts for the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study. Coordination modulation can tailor their electrostatic attractions with the metal&#8208;hydrated cations that can regulate proton migration at the catalyst surface, promoting the NRA and inhibiting the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).








Abstract
Electroreduction of nitrate into ammonia (NRA) provides a sustainable route to convert the widespread nitrate pollutants into high&#8208;value&#8208;added products under ambient conditions, which unfortunately suffers from unsatisfactory selectivity due to the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Previous strategies of modifying the metal sites of catalysts often met a dilemma for simultaneously promoting activity and selectivity toward NRA. Here, a general strategy is reported to enable an efficient and selective NRA process through coordination modulation of single&#8208;atom catalysts to tailor the local proton concentration at the catalyst surface. By contrast, two analogous Ni&#8208;single&#8208;atom enriched conjugated coordination polymers (NiO4&#8208;CCP and NiN4&#8208;CCP) with different coordination motifs are investigated for the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study. The NiO4&#8208;CCP catalyst exhibits an ammonia yield rate as high as 1.83&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 mg&#8722;1 with a Faradaic efficiency of 94.7% under a current density of 125&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, outperforming the NiN4&#8208;CCP catalyst. These experimental and theoretical studies both suggest that the strategy of coordination modulation can not only accelerate the NRA&#160;by adjusting the adsorption energies of NRA intermediates on the metal sites but also inhibit the HER through regulating the proton migration with contributions from the metal&#8208;hydrated cations adsorbed at the catalyst surface, thus achieving simultaneous enhancement of NRA selectivity and activity.

         <title>Efficient and Bright Deep&#8208;Red Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes based on a Lateral 0D/3D Perovskite Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient and bright deep&#8208;red perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) are achieved based on a lateral Cs4PbI6/FAxCs1&#8722;xPbI3 (0D/3D) heterostructure, which can simultaneously reduce nonradiative recombination and enhance light extraction. This leads to deep&#8208;red perovskite LEDs with a record external quantum efficiency of 21% at a high current density of &#8776;200&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Bright and efficient deep&#8208;red light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) are important for applications in medical therapy and biological imaging due to the high penetration of deep&#8208;red photons into human tissues. Metal&#8208;halide perovskites have potential to achieve bright and efficient electroluminescence due to their favorable optoelectronic properties. However, efficient and bright perovskite&#8208;based deep&#8208;red LEDs have not been achieved yet, due to either Auger recombination in low&#8208;dimensional perovskites or trap&#8208;assisted nonradiative recombination in 3D perovskites. Here, a lateral Cs4PbI6/FAxCs1&#8722;xPbI3 (0D/3D) heterostructure that can enable efficient deep&#8208;red perovskite LEDs at very high brightness&#160;is demonstrated. The Cs4PbI6 can facilitate the growth of low&#8208;defect FAxCs1&#8722;xPbI3, and act as low&#8208;refractive&#8208;index grids, which can simultaneously reduce nonradiative recombination and enhance light extraction. This device reaches a peak external quantum efficiency of 21.0% at a photon flux of 1.75&#160;&#215;&#160;1021 m&#8722;2 s&#8722;1, which is almost two orders of magnitude higher than that of reported high&#8208;efficiency deep&#8208;red perovskite LEDs. Theses LEDs are suitable for pulse oximeters, showing an error &lt;2% of blood oxygen saturation compared with commercial oximeters.

         <title>Impact of Planar and Vertical Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors on Flexible Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Given their low&#8208;temperature solution processability and mechanical flexibility, organic field&#8208;effect transistors are promising candidates for developing Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things technologies and realizing next&#8208;generation wearable applications. Here, the authors compare the performance of flexible transistors with the emerging vertical&#8208;transistor technology, outline the critical device fabrication and material&#8208;design strategies, and discuss their role and function in a wide range of flexible electronics applications.








Abstract
The development of flexible and conformable devices, whose performance can be maintained while being continuously deformed, provides a significant step toward the realization of next&#8208;generation wearable and e&#8208;textile applications. Organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) are particularly interesting for flexible and lightweight products, because of their low&#8208;temperature solution processability, and the mechanical flexibility of organic materials that endows OFETs the natural compatibility with plastic and biodegradable substrates. Here, an in&#8208;depth review of two competing flexible OFET technologies, planar and vertical OFETs (POFETs and VOFETs, respectively) is provided. The electrical, mechanical, and physical properties of POFETs and VOFETs are critically discussed, with a focus on four pivotal applications (integrated logic circuits, light&#8208;emitting devices, memories, and sensors). It is pointed out that the flexible function of the relatively newer VOFET technology, along with its perspective on advancing the applicability of flexible POFETs, has not been reviewed so far, and the direct comparison regarding the performance of POFET&#8208; and VOFET&#8208;based flexible applications is most likely absent. With discussions spanning printed and wearable electronics, materials science, biotechnology, and environmental monitoring, this contribution is a clear stimulus to researchers working in these fields to engage toward the plentiful possibilities that POFETs and VOFETs offer to flexible electronics.

         <title>Solvation and Interfacial Engineering Enable &#8208;40&#160;&#176;C Operation of Graphite/NCM Batteries at Energy Density over 270 wh&#160;kg&#8722;g</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kinetic barriers related to Li+ transport at low temperatures is knocked down by formulating a weakly&#8208;solvated electrolyte containing Na+ as a hetero&#8208;cation additive, where a Li&#8208;Na hybrid SEI is identified to favor Li+ migration through the multiple LiF/NaF grain boundaries. As such, the electrolyte affords a 2 Ah, 270&#160;Wh&#160;Kg&#8722;1 graphite/NCM523 pouch cell with discharge capacity of 108.7 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at &#8208;40&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) that can operate under low temperature (LT) conditions are essential for applications in orbital missions, subsea areas, and electric vehicles. Unfortunately, severe capacity loss is witnessed due to tremendous kinetic barriers that emerge at LT. Herein, to surmount such kinetic limitations, a low dielectric environment is tamed throughout the bulk electrolyte, which efficaciously brought the Li+ desolvation energy down to 30.76 KJ&#160;mol&#8722;1. At the meantime, the adoption of sodium cations (Na+) is proposed as a hetero&#8208;cation additive, and a Li&#8208;Na hybrid and fluoride&#8208;rich interphase is further identified via preferential reduction of Na+&#8208;(solvent/anion) clusters, which is found to efficiently facilitate Li+ migration through the LiF/NaF grain boundaries. Based on a N/P ratio of 1.1, the graphite/LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM) full cell (cathode loading of &#8776;18.5&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2) delivers a capacity as high as 125.1 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 under &#8208;20&#160;&#176;C with prolonged cycling to 100 cycles. Finally, a 270&#160;Wh&#160;Kg&#8722;1 graphite/NCM pouch cell is assembled, which affords a discharge capacity of 108.7 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 under &#8208;40&#160;&#176;C during the initial cycles. With an eye to both fundamental and practical aspects, this work will propel additional advancements and allow LIBs to fill more roles under extreme operation temperatures than ever before.

         <title>Dissolvable Self&#8208;Locking Microneedle Patches Integrated with Immunomodulators for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An advanced projection micro&#8208;stereolithography 3D printer&#8208;based self&#8208;locking dissolvable microneedle is presented as a mass&#8208;producible and cost&#8208;effective transdermal drug delivery platform for precise microdose delivery of drugs in a minimally invasive manner. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, a novel combination immunotherapy approach proposed to improve melanoma treatment efficacy shows a significantly higher efficacy when delivered via self&#8208;locking microneedles than intratumoral injection.








Abstract
Advancements in micro&#8208;resolution 3D printers have significantly facilitated the development of highly complex mass&#8208;producible drug delivery platforms. Conventionally, due to the limitations of micro&#8208;milling machineries, dissolvable microneedles (MNs) are mainly fabricated in cone&#8208;shaped geometry with limited drug delivery accuracy. Herein, to overcome the limitations of conventional MNs, a novel projection micro&#8208;stereolithography 3D printer&#8208;based self&#8208;locking MN for precise skin insertion, adhesion, and transcutaneous microdose drug delivery is presented. The geometry of self&#8208;locking MN consists of a sharp skin&#8208;penetrating tip, a wide skin interlocking body, and a narrow base with mechanical supports fabricated over a flexible hydrocolloid patch to improve the accuracy of skin penetration into irregular surfaces. Melanoma, a type of skin cancer, is selected as the model for the investigation of self&#8208;locking MNs due to its irregular and uneven surface. In vivo immunotherapy efficacy is evaluated by integrating SD&#8208;208, a novel transforming growth factor&#8208;&#946; (TGF&#8208;&#946;) inhibitor that suppresses the proliferation and metastasis of tumors, and anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 (aPD&#8208;L1 Ab), an immune checkpoint inhibitor that induces T cell&#8208;mediated tumor cell death, into self&#8208;locking MNs and comparing them with intratumoral injection. Evaluation of (aPD&#8208;L1 Ab)/SD&#8208;208 delivery effectiveness in B16F10 melanoma&#8208;bearing mice model confirms significantly improved dose efficacy of self&#8208;locking MNs compared with intratumoral injection.

         <title>Recent Research Progress of Organic Small&#8208;Molecule Semiconductors with High Electron Mobilities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the structural modification strategies of organic small&#8208;molecule semiconductors with high electron mobilities, a promising candidate for the construction of next&#8208;generation complementary organic logic&#8208;digital circuits, to achieve chemical stability and high electron transport properties. In addition, the applications of n&#8208;type small&#8208;molecule semiconductor materials based on high mobility in organic electronic devices, such as organic field&#8208;effect transistors, organic light&#8208;emitting transistors, organic photodetectors, and gas sensors, are introduced.








Abstract
Organic electronics has made great progress in the past decades, which is inseparable from the innovative development of organic electronic devices and the diversity of organic semiconductor materials. It is worth mentioning that both of these great advances are inextricably linked to the development of organic high&#8208;performance semiconductor materials, especially the representative n&#8208;type organic small&#8208;molecule semiconductor materials with high electron mobilities. The n&#8208;type organic small molecules have the advantages of simple synthesis process, strong intermolecular stacking, tunable molecular structure, and easy to functionalize structures. Furthermore, the n&#8208;type semiconductor is a remarkable and important component for constructing complementary logic circuits and p&#8208;n heterojunction structures. Therefore, n&#8208;type organic semiconductors play an extremely important role in the field of organic electronic materials and are the basis for the industrialization of organic electronic functional devices. This review focuses on the modification strategies of organic small molecules with high electron mobility at molecular level, and discusses in detail the applications of n&#8208;type small&#8208;molecule semiconductor materials with high mobility in organic field&#8208;effect transistors, organic light&#8208;emitting transistors, organic photodetectors, and gas sensors.

         <title>Electrochemical Replication and Transfer for Low&#8208;Cost, Sub&#8208;100&#160;nm Patterning of Materials on Flexible Substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new additive patterning technique, named electrochemical replication and transfer, is developed to pattern a wide variety of metals, semiconductors, and polymers with resolutions spanning from sub&#8208;100&#160;nm to many centimeters on flexible substrates at low cost and high throughput.








Abstract
The fabrication of high&#8208;resolution patterns on flexible substrates is an essential step in the development of flexible electronics. However, the patterning process on flexible substrates often requires expensive equipment and tedious lithographic processing. Here, a bottom&#8208;up patterning technique, termed electrochemical replication and transfer (ERT) is reported, which fabricates multiscale patterns of a wide variety of materials by selective electrodeposition of target materials on a predefined template, and subsequent transfer of the electrodeposited materials to a flexible substrate, while leaving the undamaged template for reuse for over 100 times. The additive and parallel patterning attribute of ERT allows the fabrication of multiscale patterns with resolutions spanning from sub&#8208;100&#160;nm to many centimeters simultaneously, which overcomes the trade&#8208;off between resolution and throughput of conventional patterning techniques. ERT is suitable for fabricating a wide variety of materials including metals, semiconductors, metal oxides, and polymers into arbitrary shapes on flexible substrates at a very low cost.

         <title>Ultrasensitive and Ultraprecise Pressure Sensors for Soft Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Making flexible sensors more precise is the focus of this research. It is found that by making the pressure sensing layer using pure materials&#160;and separating it from the rest of the sensor structure, the errors caused by the sensor's deformation can be reduced when it is subjected to external forces. This leads to improved precision and flexibility in sensing.








Abstract
Highly sensitive soft pressure sensors have attracted tremendous attention in recent years due to their great promise in robotics, healthcare, smart wearables, etc. Although high sensitivities can be realized by existing sensing mechanisms, they usually cause large random errors owing to inhomogeneous sensing layers, thus considerably reducing the sensing precision for practical applications. Herein, a pure&#8208;polymer and field emission bilayer structure (PFEBS)&#8208;based transduction mechanism is presented to successfully design an ultrasensitive and ultraprecise soft pressure sensor for the first time. This unique structure enables numerous tunneling electrons generated by field emission to be transmitted through the homogeneous sensing layer, which undergoes uniform deformation under subtle pressures, simultaneously achieving a sensing precision with variation &lt;1.62% and a sensitivity of 372.2 kPa&#8722;1. This study offers a new design strategy to develop next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance flexible pressure sensors for soft systems.

         <title>Photoresponsive Supramolecular Polymers: From Light&#8208;Controlled Small Molecules to Smart Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Control over supramolecular interactions is an important part of the toolbox for developing functional materials. The design of supramolecular polymers with light&#8208;triggered molecules allows remote control of supramolecular polymers and materials with high spatiotemporal precision. Here, a perspective review of various approaches and major advances toward photoresponsive supramolecular polymers with controlled functions is presented.








Abstract
Photoresponsive supramolecular polymers are well&#8208;organized assemblies based on highly oriented and reversible noncovalent interactions containing photosensitive molecules as (co&#8208;)monomers. They have attracted increasing interest in smart materials and dynamic systems with precisely controllable functions, such as light&#8208;driven soft actuators, photoresponsive fluorescent anticounterfeiting and light&#8208;triggered electronic devices. The present review discusses light&#8208;activated molecules used in photoresponsive supramolecular polymers with their main photo&#8208;induced changes, e.g., geometry, dipole moment, and chirality. Based on these distinct changes, supramolecular polymers formed by light&#8208;activated molecules exhibit photoresponsive disassembly and reassembly. As a consequence, photo&#8208;induced supramolecular polymerization, &#8220;depolymerization,&#8221; and regulation of the lengths and topologies are observed. Moreover, the light&#8208;controlled functions of supramolecular polymers, such as actuation, emission, and chirality transfer along length scales, are highlighted. Furthermore, a perspective on challenges and future opportunities is presented. Besides the challenge of moving from harmful UV light to visible/near IR light avoiding fatigue, and enabling biomedical applications, future opportunities include light&#8208;controlled supramolecular actuators with helical motion, light&#8208;modulated information transmission, optically recyclable materials, and multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive supramolecular systems.

Integrating a coordination polymer catalyst consisting of Cu(I) and benzimidazole units linked via Cu(I)&#8208;imidazole coordination bonds in a cation exchange membrane&#8208;based membrane electrode assembly enables stable acetate electrosynthesis for 190&#160;h, while achieving direct collection of concentrated acetate, an average single&#8208;pass utilization of 50%, and an average acetate full&#8208;cell energy efficiency of 15% at 250&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Upgrading carbon dioxide/monoxide to multi&#8208;carbon C2+ products using renewable electricity offers one route to more sustainable fuel and chemical production. One of the most appealing products is acetate, the profitable electrosynthesis of which demands a catalyst with higher efficiency. Here, a coordination polymer (CP) catalyst is reported that consists of Cu(I) and benzimidazole units linked via Cu(I)&#8208;imidazole coordination bonds, which enables selective reduction of CO to acetate with a 61% Faradaic efficiency at &#8722;0.59 volts versus the reversible hydrogen electrode at a current density of 400&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in flow cells. The catalyst is integrated in a cation exchange membrane&#8208;based membrane electrode assembly that enables stable acetate electrosynthesis for 190&#160;h, while achieving direct collection of concentrated acetate (3.3 molar) from the cathodic liquid stream, an average single&#8208;pass utilization of 50% toward CO&#8208;to&#8208;acetate conversion, and an average acetate full&#8208;cell energy efficiency of 15% at a current density of 250&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Wavelength Light&#8208;Responsive Metal&#8211;Phenolic Network&#8208;Based Microrobots for Reactive Species Scavenging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a hollow metal&#8211;phenolic network&#8208;based microrobot with spray&#8208;coated asymmetric capping is reported capable of moving under both near&#8208;infrared irradiation and ultraviolet irradiation without fuel. With multi&#8208;wavelength light&#8208;responsiveness, tunable size of the particles, and great reactive oxygen and nitrogen species scavenging capacity, the proposed microrobots can be ideal for future in vivo analytical sensing and medical treatment.








Abstract
Light&#8208;driven microrobots with different propulsion mechanisms have attracted great attention in microrobot synthesis and applications. However, current systems rely heavily on precious metals, using a complex synthesis process and limited working wavelength. It is therefore of great interest to fabricate microrobots that can be driven by multi&#8208;wavelength irradiation and with simple components. Here, metal&#8211;phenolic network (MPN)&#8208;based microrobots are synthesized using a sacrificial polystyrene bead template and an extra capping is added to regulate their symmetry. The hollow MPN microrobots with different layers of capping are capable of moving under both near&#8208;infrared (NIR) irradiation and ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, without fuel. The velocity of the microrobots under irradiation is altered by the thickness of the asymmetric capping and their motion could be manipulated remotely by switching the NIR or UV irradiation on and off. With light&#8208;driven mobility, the reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) scavenging activity of the microrobots is significantly increased. Therefore, this proposed microrobot system provides a synthesis strategy to develop asymmetric light&#8208;navigated microrobots for future medical treatment with tunable structure, multi&#8208;wavelength light&#8208;responsive mobility, and great RONS scavenging capacity.

         <title>Membrane&#8208;Fusion&#8208;Mediated Multiplex Engineering of Tumor Cell Surface Glycans for Enhanced NK Cell Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A core&#8211;shell membrane&#8208;fusogenic liposome is designed to fuse with tumor cell membrane to deliver sialyltransferase inhibitor&#8208;loaded core into cytoplasm and anchor natural killer (NK)&#8208;activating glycan&#8208;modified shell onto surface synchronously. This membrane&#8208;fusion&#8208;mediated delivery approach reprograms the sialic acid&#8208;caused immunosuppression of tumor surface into a Lewis X trisaccharide&#8208;based NK&#8208;activating type, sufficiently reactivating the NK recognition and lysis for enhanced antitumor therapy.








Abstract
Natural killer (NK) cell therapies show potential for tumor treatment but are immunologically resisted by the overexpressed immunosuppressing tumor cell surface glycans. To reverse this glycan&#8208;mediated immunosuppression, the surface NK&#8208;inhibitory glycan expressions need to be downregulated and NK&#8208;activating glycan levels should be elevated synchronously with optimal efficiency. Here, a core&#8211;shell membrane&#8208;fusogenic liposome (MFL) is designed to simultaneously achieve the physical modification of NK&#8208;activating glycans and biological inhibition of immunosuppressing glycans on the tumor cell surface via a membrane&#8208;fusion manner. Loaded into a tumor&#8208;microenvironment&#8208;triggered&#8208;degradable thermosensitive hydrogel, MFLs could be conveniently injected and controllably released into local tumor. Through fusion with tumor cell membrane, the released MFLs could simultaneously deliver sialyltransferase&#8208;inhibitor&#8208;loaded core into cytoplasm, and anchor NK&#8208;activating&#8208;glycan&#8208;modified shell onto tumor surface. This spatially&#8208;differential distribution of core and shell in one cell ensures the effective inhibition of intracellular sialyltransferase to downregulate immunosuppressing sialic acid, and direct presentation of NK&#8208;activating Lewis X trisaccharide (LeX) on tumor surface simultaneously. Consequentially, the sialic acid&#8208;caused immunosuppression of tumor surface is reprogrammed to be LeX&#8208;induced NK activation, resulting in sensitive susceptibility to NK&#8208;cell&#8208;mediated recognition and lysis for improved tumor elimination. This MFL provides a novel platform for multiplex&#160;cell engineering and personalized regulation of intercellular interactions for enhanced cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Unlocking High Capacity and Fast Na+ Diffusion of HxCrS2 by Proton&#8208;Exchange Pretreatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pretreatment of NaCrS2 to produce HxCrS2 results in a more robust and higher performing electrode by numerous measures. Proton exchange produces a heterostructure that permits fast diffusion while also seemingly unlocking reversible access to cationic redox, enabling high capacity. The unique biphasic structure of HxCrS2 may be generalizable to other materials, opening a new class of electrode materials.








Abstract
This study presents a new material, &#8220;HxCrS2&#8221; (denotes approximate composition) formed by proton&#8208;exchange of NaCrS2 which has a measured capacity of 728 mAh g&#8722;1 with significant improvements to capacity retention, sustaining over 700 mAh g&#8722;1 during cycling experiments. This is the highest reported capacity for a transition metal sulfide electrode and outperforms the most promising proposed sodium anodes to date. HxCrS2 exhibits a biphasic structure featuring alternating crystalline and amorphous lamella on the scale of a few nanometers. This unique structural motif enables reversible access to Cr redox in the material resulting in higher capacities than seen in the parent structure which features only S redox. Pretreatment by proton&#8208;exchange offers a route to materials such as HxCrS2 which provide fast diffusion and high capacities for sodium&#8208;ion&#160;batteries.

         <title>Dislocated Bilayer MOF Enables High&#8208;Selectivity Photocatalytic Reduction of CO2 to CO</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D monolayer and 2D bilayer metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are constructed by a simple solvothermal method. The bilayer MOF is a novel dislocation 2D porphyrin&#8208;based MOF material that exhibits good structural stability as well as ultra&#8208;high CO selectivity for photocatalytic CO2 reduction (100% selectivity). This work offers a new strategy for the construction of bilayer MOFs and provides a new perspective for the customization of photocatalytic performance.








Abstract
The highly selective photoreduction of CO2 into valuable small&#8208;molecule chemical feedstocks such as CO is an effective strategy for addressing the energy crisis and environmental problems. However, it remains a challenge because the complex CO2 photoreduction process usually generates multiple possible products and requires a subsequent separation step. In this paper, 2D monolayer and bilayer porphyrin&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are successfully constructed by adjusting the reaction temperature and solvent polarity with 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;pyridyl)porphyrin as the light&#8208;harvesting ligand. The bilayer MOF is a low&#8208;dimensional MOF with a special structure in which the upper and lower layers are arranged in dislocation and are bridged by halogen ions. This bilayer MOF exhibits 100% ultra&#8208;high selectivity for the reduction of CO2 to CO under simulated sunlight without any cocatalyst or photosensitizer and can be recycled at least three times. The intrinsic mechanism of this photocatalytic CO2 reduction process is explored through experimental characterization and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work shows that the rational design of the number of layers in 2D MOF structures can tune the stability of these structures and opens a new avenue for the design of highly selective MOF photocatalysts.

The bilayer MOF is a novel dislocation 2D porphyrin-based MOF material that exhibits good structural stability as well as ultra-high CO selectivity for photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction (100% selectivity). This work offers a new strategy for the construction of bilayer MOFs and provides a new perspective for the customization of photocatalytic performance.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highly selective photoreduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into valuable small-molecule chemical feedstocks such as CO is an effective strategy for addressing the energy crisis and environmental problems. However, it remains a challenge because the complex CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photoreduction process usually generates multiple possible products and requires a subsequent separation step. In this paper, 2D monolayer and bilayer porphyrin-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are successfully constructed by adjusting the reaction temperature and solvent polarity with 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-pyridyl)porphyrin as the light-harvesting ligand. The bilayer MOF is a low-dimensional MOF with a special structure in which the upper and lower layers are arranged in dislocation and are bridged by halogen ions. This bilayer MOF exhibits 100% ultra-high selectivity for the reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to CO under simulated sunlight without any cocatalyst or photosensitizer and can be recycled at least three times. The intrinsic mechanism of this photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction process is explored through experimental characterization and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work shows that the rational design of the number of layers in 2D MOF structures can tune the stability of these structures and opens a new avenue for the design of highly selective MOF photocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Sensitive Tin&#8208;Lead Perovskite Photodetectors with Over 450 Days Stability Enabled by Synergistic Engineering for Pulse Oximetry System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multifunctional additive 4&#8208;amino&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluorobenzoic acid (ATFBA), with terminal amino and carboxyl groups, passivates the surface defects and enhances the stability of the Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite, therefore resulting in high sensitivity and highly stable Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite photodetectors. In addition, the ATFBA&#8208;based photodetector has been integrated with a pulse oximetry visualization system, successfully yielding accurate blood oxygen saturation and heart rate.








Abstract
Low&#8208;bandgap tin (Sn)&#8208;lead (Pb) halide perovskites can achieve near&#8208;infrared response for photodetectors. However, the Sn&#8208;based devices suffer from notorious instability and high defect densities due to the oxidation propensity of Sn2+. Herein, a multifunctional additive 4&#8208;amino&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluorobenzoic acid (ATFBA) is presented, which can passivate surface defects and inhibit the oxidation of Sn2+ through hydrogen bonds and chelation coordination from the terminal amino and carboxyl groups. The perfluorinated benzene ring structure of ATFBA affords the passivator assembled at the grain boundaries to enhance the water resistance. With the synergistical passivation of these functional groups, the Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite photodetector exhibits a remarkable responsivity of 0.52&#160;A&#160;W&#8208;1 and an excellent specific detectivity of 5.34&#160;&#215;&#160;1012 Jones at 850&#160;nm, along with remaining 97% of its initial responsivity over 450 days. Benefitting from high sensitivity, the photodetector is integrated into a pulse oximetry sensor visualization system, yielding accurate blood oxygen saturation and heart rate with less than 2% error. This work paves the avenue toward constructing high&#8208;performance and stable Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite photodetectors for practical applications.

         <title>Y&#8208;Type Non&#8208;Fullerene Acceptors with Outer Branched Side Chains and Inner Cyclohexane Side Chains for 19.36% Efficiency Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Y&#8208;type non&#8208;fullerene acceptors with outer branched side chains and inner cyclohexane side chains are designed for polymer solar cells with the power conversion efficiencies of 18.52% and 19.36% achieved in the binary and ternary blend devices, respectively, which are among the highest values for single&#8208;junction solar cells at present.








Abstract
Raising the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of Y&#8208;type non&#8208;fullerene acceptors can increase the open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) and thus the photovoltaic performance of the current top performing polymer solar cells (PSCs). One of the viable routes is demonstrated by the successful Y6 derivative of L8&#8208;BO with the branched alkyl chains at the outer side. This will introduce steric hindrance and reduce intermolecular aggregation, thus open up the bandgap and raise the LUMO energy level. To take further advantages of the steric hindrance influence on optoelectronic properties of Y6 derivatives, two Y&#8208;type non&#8208;fullerene acceptors of BTP&#8208;Cy&#8208;4F and BTP&#8208;Cy&#8208;4Cl are designed and synthesized by adopting outer branched side chains and inner cyclohexane side chains. An outstanding Voc of 0.937&#160;V is achieved in the D18:BTP&#8208;Cy&#8208;4F binary blend devices along with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.52%. With the addition of BTP&#8208;eC9 to extend the absorption spectral coverage, a remarkable PCE of 19.36% is realized finally in the related ternary blend devices, which is one of the highest values for single&#8208;junction PSCs at present. The results illustrate the great potential of cyclohexane side chains in constructing high&#8208;performance non&#8208;fullerene acceptors and their PSCs.

         <title>Over 19% Efficiency Organic Solar Cells by Regulating Multidimensional Intermolecular Interactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intermolecular interactions are ubiquitous and elusive in organic solar cells. Herein, the complicated relationship between multidimensional intermolecular interactions in active layers and photovoltaic performance is disclosed. The results show that complex interactions are critical to synergistically regulating comprehensive properties, including molecular assembly, stacking orientations, charge transport, and morphology management, which helps to achieve an efficiency over 19% in ternary devices.








Abstract
Research on organic solar cells (OSCs) has progressed through material innovation and device engineering. However, well&#8208;known and ubiquitous intermolecular interactions, and particularly their synergistic effects, have received little attention. Herein, the complicated relationship between photovoltaic conversion and multidimensional intermolecular interactions in the active layers is investigated. These interactions are dually regulated by side&#8208;chain isomerization and end&#8208;cap engineering of the acceptors. The phenylalkyl featured acceptors (LA&#8208;series) exhibit stronger crystallinity with preferential face&#8208;on interactions relative to the alkylphenyl attached isomers (ITIC&#8208;series). In addition, the PM6&#160;and LA&#8208;series acceptors exhibit moderate donor/acceptor interactions compared to those of the strongly interacting PM6/ITIC&#8208;series pairs, which helps to enhance phase separation and charge transport. Consequently, the output efficiencies of all LA series acceptors are over 14%. Moreover, LA&#8208;series acceptors show appropriate compatibility, host/guest interactions, and crystallinity relationships with BTP&#8208;eC9, thereby leading to uniform and well&#8208;organized &#8220;alloy&#8208;like&#8221; mixed phases. In particular, the highly crystalline LA23&#160;further optimizes multiple interactions and ternary microstructures, which results in a high efficiency of 19.12%. Thus, these results highlight the importance of multidimensional intermolecular interactions in the photovoltaic performance of OSCs.

         <title>Efficient Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells on Industrially Compatible Textured Silicon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, an anion&#8208;engineered additive strategy is reported to modify the crystallization process of perovskite films on industrially feasible double&#8208;side textured silicon, which enables conformal deposition with improved film crystallinity and reduced trap density. This allows the fabrication of perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells with efficiencies of 28.9% (certified efficiency of 27.9%) and 25.1% for areas of 1 and 16&#160;cm2, respectively.








Abstract
Monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells promise power&#8208;conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding the Shockley&#8208;Queisser limit of single&#8208;junction solar cells. The conformal deposition of perovskites on industrially feasible textured silicon solar cells allows for both lowered manufacturing costs and a higher matched photocurrent density, compared to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art tandems using front&#8208;side flat or mildly textured silicon. However, the inferior crystal quality of perovskite films grown on fully&#8208;textured silicon compromises the photovoltaic performance. Here, an anion&#8208;engineered additive strategy is developed to control the crystallization process of wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite films, which enables improved film crystallinity, reduced trap density, and conformal deposition on industrially textured silicon. This strategy allows the fabrication of 28.6%&#8208;efficient perovskite/silicon heterojunction tandem solar cells (certified 27.9%, 1&#160;cm2). This approach is compatible with the scalable fabrication of tandems on industrially textured silicon, demonstrating an efficiency of 25.1% for an aperture area of 16&#160;cm2. The anion&#8208;engineered additive significantly improves the operating stability of wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells, and the encapsulated tandem solar cells retain over 80% of their initial performance following 2000&#160;h of operation under full 1&#8208;sun illumination in ambient conditions.

         <title>Resistive Switching Crossbar Arrays Based on Layered Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Resistive switching devices made of layered materials (LMs) have shown interesting performance. However, most studies employ fabrication methods and device structures that are not industry&#8208;relevant. In this review, the focus is on the status of crossbar arrays of LMs.








Abstract
Resistive switching (RS) devices are metal/insulator/metal cells that can change their electrical resistance when electrical stimuli are applied between the electrodes, and they can be used to store and compute data. Planar crossbar arrays of RS devices can offer a high integration density (&gt;108&#160;devices mm&#8722;2) and this can be further enhanced by stacking them three&#8208;dimensionally. The advantage of using layered materials (LMs) in RS devices compared to traditional phase&#8208;change materials and metal oxides is that their electrical properties can be adjusted with a higher precision. Here, the key figures&#8208;of&#8208;merit and procedures to implement LM&#8208;based RS devices are defined. LM&#8208;based RS devices fabricated using methods compatible with industry are identified and discussed. The focus is on small devices (size&#160;&lt;&#160;9&#160;&#181;m2) arranged in crossbar structures, since larger devices may be affected by artifacts, such as grain boundaries and flake junctions. How to enhance device performance, so to accelerate the development of this technology, is also discussed.

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Promoted Co&#8208;Production of Dihydroisoquinoline and H2O2 over Defective Zn3In2S6</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;functional and defective Zn3In2S6 photocatalyst is developed for the simultaneous efficient photocatalytic co&#8208;syntheses of dihydroisoquinoline and H2O2, which shows the highest rate for both reactions up to date.








Abstract
One of the most sustainable and promising approaches for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production in a low&#8208;cost and environment&#8208;friendly way is photosynthesis, which, however, suffers from poor carrier utilization and low H2O2 productivity. The addition of proton donors such as isopropanol or ethanol can increase H2O2 production, which, unfortunately, will inevitably elevate the entire cost while wasting the oxidizing power of holes (h+). Herein, the tetrahydroisoquinolines (THIQs) is employed as a distinctive proton donor for the thermodynamically feasible and selective semi&#8208;dehydrogenation reaction to highly valuable dihydroisoquinolines (DHIQs), and meanwhile, to couple with and promote H2O2 generation in one photoredox reaction under the photocatalysis by dual&#8208;functional Zn3In2S6 photocatalyst. Surprisingly, the suitably defective Zn3In2S6 offers an excellent and near&#8208;stoichiometric co&#8208;production performance of H2O2 and DHIQs at unprecedentedly high rates of 66.4 and 62.1&#160;mmol h&#8208;1 g&#8208;1 under visible light (&#955;&#160;&#8805; 400&#160;nm), respectively, which outperforms all the previously available reports even though sacrificial agents&#160;were&#160;employed in those reports. Additionally, photocatalytic redox reaction mechanism demonstrates that H2O2 can be generated through multiple pathways, highlighting the synergistic effect among ROS (&#183;O2&#8208; and 1O2), h+ and proton donor, which has been ignored in previous studies.

         <title>Symmetry&#8208;Guaranteed High Carrier Mobility in Quasi&#8208;2D Thermoelectric Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The horizontal mirror symmetry in BaAgSb vanishes the electron&#8211;phonon coupling mediated by phonons with purely out&#8208;of&#8208;plane vibrational vectors, which weakens the phonon&#8208;induced carrier scattering and triggers a record hole mobility among polycrystalline quasi&#8208;2D thermoelectrics. Such high mobility accompanied with intrinsically low thermal conductivity gives rise to excellent p&#8208;type thermoelectric performance in polycrystalline BaAgSb.








Abstract
Quasi&#8208;2D semiconductors have garnered immense research interest for next&#8208;generation electronics and thermoelectrics due to their unique structural, mechanical, and transport properties. However, most quasi&#8208;2D semiconductors experimentally synthesized so far have relatively low carrier mobility, preventing the achievement of exceptional power output. To break through this obstacle, a route is proposed based on the crystal symmetry arguments to facilitate the charge transport of quasi&#8208;2D semiconductors, in which the horizontal mirror symmetry is found to vanish the electron&#8211;phonon coupling strength mediated by phonons with purely out&#8208;of&#8208;plane vibrational vectors. This is demonstrated in ZrBeSi&#8208;type quasi&#8208;2D systems, where the representative sample Ba1.01AgSb shows a high room&#8208;temperature hole mobility of 344 cm2 V&#8722;1 S&#8722;1, a record value among quasi&#8208;2D polycrystalline thermoelectrics. Accompanied by intrinsically low thermal conductivity, an excellent p&#8208;type zT of &#8776;1.3 is reached at 1012 K, which is the highest value in ZrBeSi&#8208;type compounds. This work uncovers the relation between electron&#8211;phonon coupling and crystal symmetry in quasi&#8208;2D systems, which broadens the horizon to develop high mobility semiconductors for electronic and energy conversion applications.

         <title>Reshaping de Novo Protein Switches into Bioresponsive Materials for Biomarker, Toxin, and Viral Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining regenerated silk fibroin and de novo protein switches enables the design of a variety of sensing interfaces that have long shelf life and are highly sensitive and specific to numerous analytes such as pathogens, viruses, cancer markers, and toxins.








Abstract
De novo designed protein switches are powerful tools to specifically and sensitively detect diverse targets with simple chemiluminescent readouts. Finding an appropriate material host for de novo designed protein switches without altering their thermodynamics while preserving their intrinsic stability over time would enable the development of a variety of sensing formats to monitor exposure to pathogens, toxins, and for disease diagnosis. Here, a de novo protein&#8208;biopolymer hybrid that maintains the detection capabilities induced by the conformational change of the incorporated proteins&#160;in response to analytes of interest is generated in multiple, shelf&#8208;stable material formats without the need of refrigerated storage conditions. A set of functional demonstrator devices including personal protective equipment such as masks and laboratory gloves, free&#8208;standing films, air quality monitors, and wearable devices is presented to illustrate the versatility of the approach. Such formats are designed to be responsive to human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2), anti&#8208;hepatitis B (HBV) antibodies, Botulinum neurotoxin B (BoNT/B), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2). This combination of form and function offers wide opportunities for ubiquitous sensing in multiple environments by enabling a large class of bio&#8208;responsive interfaces of broad utility.

         <title>Rational Screening of Artificial Solid Electrolyte Interphases on Zn for Ultrahigh&#8208;Rate and Long&#8208;Life Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The exploration about solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs) on Zn anodes is based on trial and error, which is laborious, inefficient, and missing of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art candidates. In this work, an exercisable way is proposed to screen the potential SEIs in view of dendrite&#8208;suppressing ability and charge&#8208;transfer property. As an output, Zn3(BO3)2 is reported as the SEI on Zn anode.








Abstract
Solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on Zn anodes plays a pivotal role for high&#8208;rate and long&#8208;life aqueous batteries, because it effectively inhibits side reactions and dendritic growth. Many materials are explored as SEIs by a trial&#8208;and&#8208;error approach. Herein, an exercisable way is proposed to screen the potential SEIs on Zn anodes in view of dendrite&#8208;suppressing ability and charge&#8208;transfer property theoretically. As an output of this screening, Zn3(BO3)2 (ZBO) is checked experimentally. In symmetrical cells, Zn@ZBO runs over 250&#160;h at an ultrahigh current density of 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for a large areal capacity 10 mAh cm&#8722;2. In full cells, Zn@ZBO||MnO2 shows an impressive cumulative capacity (&#8776;406 mAh cm&#8722;2) under harsh conditions, i.e., a lean electrolyte condition (10&#160;&#181;L mAh&#8722;1), limited Zn supply (negative/positive electrode capacity ratio, N/P ratio = 2.3), and high areal capacity (5.0 mAh cm&#8722;2). The significance of this work lies in not only the first report of ZBO on Zn showing excellent electrochemical performance, but also a feasible way to screen the promising SEI materials for other metal anodes.

As an output, Zn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(BO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is reported as the SEI on Zn anode.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on Zn anodes plays a pivotal role for high-rate and long-life aqueous batteries, because it effectively inhibits side reactions and dendritic growth. Many materials are explored as SEIs by a trial-and-error approach. Herein, an exercisable way is proposed to screen the potential SEIs on Zn anodes in view of dendrite-suppressing ability and charge-transfer property theoretically. As an output of this screening, Zn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(BO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (ZBO) is checked experimentally. In symmetrical cells, Zn@ZBO runs over 250&#160;h at an ultrahigh current density of 50&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; for a large areal capacity 10 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. In full cells, Zn@ZBO||MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; shows an impressive cumulative capacity (&#8776;406 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) under harsh conditions, i.e., a lean electrolyte condition (10&#160;&#181;L mAh&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), limited Zn supply (negative/positive electrode capacity ratio, N/P ratio = 2.3), and high areal capacity (5.0 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). The significance of this work lies in not only the first report of ZBO on Zn showing excellent electrochemical performance, but also a feasible way to screen the promising SEI materials for other metal anodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Core&#8211;Shell Engineering of Conductive Fillers toward Enhanced Dielectric Properties: A Universal Polarization Mechanism in Polymer Conductor Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new polarization mechanism based on electron displacement across a filler&#8208;cluster is developed, which can quantitatively explain dielectric behaviors of percolative polymer composites. With the guidance, a novel design principle, via the manipulation of filler structure and composite morphology, to achieve desirable dielectric properties is demonstrated. The composite design is fundamentally different from traditional approaches based on filler&#8211;polymer interfaces.








Abstract
Flexible dielectric and electronic materials with high dielectric constant (k) and low loss are constantly pursued. Encapsulation of conductive fillers with insulating shells represents a promising approach, and has attracted substantial research efforts. However, progress is greatly impeded due to the lack of a fundamental understanding of the polarization mechanism. In this work, a series of core&#8211;shell polymer composites is studied, and the correlation between macroscopic dielectric properties (across entire composites) and microscopic polarization (around single fillers) is investigated. It is revealed that the polarization in polymer conductor composites is determined by electron transport across multiple neighboring conductive fillers&#8212;a domain&#8208;type polarization. The formation of a core&#8211;shell filler structure affects the dielectric properties of tpolymer composites by essentially modifying the filler&#8208;cluster size. Based on this understanding, a novel percolative composite is prepared with higher&#8208;than&#8208;normal filler concentration and optimized shell's electrical resistivity. The developed composite shows both high&#8208;k due to enlarged cluster size and low loss due to restrained charge transport simultaneously, which cannot be achieved in traditional percolative composites or via simple core&#8211;shell filler design. The revealed polarization mechanism and the optimization strategy for core&#8211;shell fillers provide critical guidance and a new paradigm, for developing advanced polymer dielectrics with promising property sets.

         <title>Dimensional Control of Highly Anisotropic and Transparent Conductive Coordination Polymers for Solution&#8208;Processable Large&#8208;Scale 2D Sheets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The material dimension of copper&#8208;halide coordination polymers can be controlled for 1D, 2D, and 3D via solution&#8208;based strategies. The coordination polymer exhibits a highly anisotropic electronic conductivity of up to &#8776;1000 differences through polaron&#8208;mediated electron transfer. The dimensional control and intrinsic anisotropy add a new degree of freedom to the excitation, detection, and control of electrons and photons.








Abstract
Controlling the dimensional aspect of conductive coordination polymers is currently a key scientific interest. Herein, solution&#8208;based dimension control strategies are proposed for copper chloride thiourea (CuCl&#8208;TU) coordination polymers that enable centimeter&#8208;scale, 2D nanosheet formation for use as transparent electrodes. Despite the wide bandgap of CuCl&#8208;TU polymers (4.33&#160;eV), through polaron&#8208;mediated electron transfer, the electrical conductivity of the 2D sheet at room temperature is able to reach 4.45 S cm&#8722;1 without intentional doping. This leads to a highly anisotropic electronic conductivity of up to the order of &#8776;103 differences, depending on the material orientation. Furthermore, by substituting alternative thiourea candidates, it is demonstrated that it is possible to predesign CuCl&#8208;TU&#160;structures with the desired functionality, stability, and porosity through dimensional control. These findings provide a blueprint to design next&#8208;generation transparent conducting materials that can operate at room temperature, thereby expanding their applicability to different fields.

         <title>Locking Active Li Metal through Localized Redistribution of Fluoride Enabling Stable Li&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A LiF&#8208;rich interphase is constructed via a LiF dissolution&#8211;reprecipitation mechanism, which is conceptually different from mainstream methods. The overall protective LiF&#8208;rich interphase endows the metallic Li electrode with significantly improved anticorrosive properties against electrolytes under various test conditions and enables stable Li&#8208;metal batteries.








Abstract
The creation of fluorinated interphase has emerged as an effective strategy for improving Li&#8208;metal anodes for rechargeable high&#8208;energy batteries. In contrast to the introduction of fluorine&#8208;containing species through widely adopted electrolyte engineering, a Li&#8208;metal composite design is reported in which LiF can locally redistribute on the Li&#8208;metal surface in liquid electrolytes via a dissolution&#8211;reprecipitation mechanism, and enable the formation of a high&#8208;fluorine&#8208;content solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). For validation, a Li/Li22Sn5/LiF ternary composite is investigated, where the as&#8208;formed LiF&#8208;rich SEI locks the active Li metal from corrosive electrolyte. The Li/Li22Sn5/LiF anode displays an impressive average Coulombic efficiency (ACE, &#8776;99.2%) at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 1 mAh cm&#8722;2 in a carbonate electrolyte and a remarkable cycling life of over 1600&#160;h at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 2 mAh cm&#8722;2. Applied to a LiCoO2 full cell with a high cathode areal capacity of 4.0 mAh cm&#8722;2, a high capacity retention of &#8776;91.1% is realized for 100 cycles at 0.5 C between 2.8 to 4.5&#160;V with a low negative/positive (N/P) ratio of 2:1. This design is conceptually different from the design employing the widely used fluorine&#8208;containing electrolyte additive and provides an alternative approach to realize reliable Li&#8208;metal batteries.

         <title>Enhanced Flexible Mold Lifetime for Roll&#8208;to&#8208;Roll Scaled&#8208;Up Manufacturing of Adhesive Complex Microstructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;step curing technique, including an incomplete curing process and a post&#8208;curing process, is presented as a strategy to enhance the flexible mold lifetime in UV&#8208;curing&#8208;based roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll manufacturing systems. By utilizing the technique, silicone molds patterned with complex adhesive microstructures are replicated over 1000 cycles by highly adhesive polyurethane acrylate materials.








Abstract
Various functional complex 3D patterned surfaces with micro&#8208; or nanostructures have been developed and their superior performances over non&#8208;patterned smooth surfaces proven. However, it is challenging to mass&#8208;produce such complex micro&#8208;/nanopatterned surfaces, which limits their commercialization drastically. Although roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll (R2R) manufacturing using flexible molds has been implemented for mass&#8208;production of such functional surfaces, the poor mold repeatability issue has not been resolved yet. Here, a strategy to significantly improve the repeatability of the micropatterned flexible silicone molds over 1000 cycles against highly adhesive polyurethane acrylates (PUAs) in UV light curing based R2R systems by using a two&#8208;step curing process is reported. The mold repeatability is drastically increased from 10s of cycles to over 1000 cycles through the proposed strategy in spite of the complicated 3D undercut geometry and high tackiness of the microstructure. This two&#8208;step process would enable scaled&#8208;up production of micro&#8208;/nanostructured adhesives, such as gecko&#8208;inspired microfiber adhesives as demonstrated in this study, as well as various other functional micro&#8208;/nanostructured surfaces by enhancing the flexible mold lifetime.

         <title>Tethered Small&#8208;Molecule Acceptors Simultaneously Enhance the Efficiency and Stability of Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thermodynamic relaxation of small&#8208;molecule acceptors (SMAs) in its blend with polymer donor raises concerns related to the long&#8208;term operational stability of polymer solar cells. With flexible spacers to restrict the motion of individual SMAs, the tethered SMAs show higher efficiency, and, most important, large glass transition temperatures to suppress the thermodynamic relaxation in mixed domains.








Abstract
For polymer solar cells (PSCs), the mixture of polymer donors and small&#8208;molecule acceptors (SMAs) is fine&#8208;tuned to realize a favorable kinetically trapped morphology and thus a commercially viable device efficiency. However, the thermodynamic relaxation of the mixed domains within the blend raises concerns related to the long&#8208;term operational stability of the devices, especially in the record&#8208;holding Y&#8208;series SMAs. Here, a new class of dimeric Y6&#8208;based SMAs tethered with differential flexible spacers is reported to regulate their aggregation and relaxation behavior. In their polymer blends with PM6, it is found that they favor an improved structural order relative to that of Y6 counterpart. Most importantly, the tethered SMAs show large glass transition temperatures to suppress the thermodynamic relaxation in mixed domains. For the high&#8208;performing dimeric blend, an unprecedented open circuit voltage of 0.87&#160;V is realized with a conversion efficiency of 17.85%, while those of regular Y6&#8208;base devices only reach 0.84&#160;V and 16.93%, respectively. Most importantly, the dimer&#8208;based device possesses substantially reduced burn&#8208;in efficiency loss, retaining more than 80% of the initial efficiency after operating at the maximum power point under continuous illumination for 700&#160;h. The tethering approach provides a new direction to develop PSCs with high efficiency and excellent operating stability.

         <title>A Monolithic Stochastic Computing Architecture for Energy Efficient Arithmetic</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stochastic computing architecture for arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and sorting, with low energy and area overhead through monolithic integration of logic gates and stochastic&#8208;bit generator is reported, which exploits the cycle&#8208;to&#8208;cycle variation in programming of 2D memtransistors based on monolayer MoS2.








Abstract
As the energy and hardware investments necessary for conventional high&#8208;precision digital computing continue to explode in the era of artificial intelligence (AI), a change in paradigm that can trade precision for energy and resource efficiency is being sought for many computing applications. Stochastic computing (SC) is an attractive alternative since, unlike digital computers, which require many logic gates and a high transistor volume to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, sorting, etc., SC can implement the same using simple logic gates. While it is possible to accelerate SC using traditional silicon complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) technology, the need for extensive hardware investment to generate stochastic bits (s&#8208;bits), the fundamental computing primitive for SC, makes it less attractive. Memristor and spin&#8208;based devices offer natural randomness but depend on hybrid designs involving CMOS peripherals for accelerating SC, which increases area and energy burden. Here, the limitations of existing and emerging technologies are overcome, and a standalone SC architecture embedded in memory and based on 2D&#160;memtransistors is experimentally demonstrated. The monolithic and non&#8208;von&#8208;Neumann SC architecture occupies a small hardware footprint and consumes a miniscule amount of energy (&lt;1&#160;nJ) for both s&#8208;bit generation and arithmetic operations, highlighting the benefits of SC.

         <title>Drug Delivery in Plants Using Silk Microneedles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The utility of silk&#8208;based microneedles is demonstrated in delivery of plant hormones (gibberellic acid) to Arabidopsis thaliana and several crop species with minimal wounding response and higher efficiency and efficacy than foliar spray. Microneedle&#8208;mediated delivery allows tissues restricted by current delivery methods to be reached and opens the door to a new tool for plant science and precision agriculture.








Abstract
New systems for agrochemical delivery in plants will foster precise agricultural practices and provide new tools to study plants and design crop traits, as standard spray methods suffer from elevated loss and limited access to remote plant tissues. Silk&#8208;based microneedles can circumvent these limitations by deploying a known amount of payloads directly in plants&#8217; deep tissues. However, plant response to microneedles&#8217; application and microneedles&#8217; efficacy in deploying physiologically relevant biomolecules are unknown. Here, it is shown that gene expression associated with Arabidopsis thaliana wounding response decreases within 24 h post microneedles&#8217; application. Additionally, microinjection of gibberellic acid (GA3) in A. thaliana mutant ft&#8208;10 provides a more effective and efficient mean than spray to activate GA3 pathways, accelerating bolting and inhibiting flower formation. Microneedle efficacy in delivering GA3 is also observed in several monocot and dicot crop species, i.e., tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), lettuce (Lactuca sativa), spinach (Spinacia oleracea), rice (Oryza Sativa), maize (Zea mays), barley (Hordeum vulgare), and soybean (Glycine max). The wide range of plants that can be successfully targeted with microinjectors opens the doors to their use in plant science and agriculture.

Abstract
Mesocrystals are a class of nanostructured material, where a multiple&#8208;length&#8208;scale structure is a prerequisite of many interesting phenomena. Resolving the mesocrystal structure is quite challenging due to their structuration on different length scales. The combination of small&#8208; and wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS and WAXS) techniques offers the possibility of non&#8208;destructively probing mesocrystalline structures simultaneously, over multiple length scales to reveal their microscopic structure. This work describes how high dynamical range of modern detectors sheds light on the weak features of scattering, significantly increasing the information content. The detailed analysis of X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) from the magnetite mesocrystals with different particle sizes and shapes is described, in tandem with electron microscopy. The revealed features provide valuable input to the models of mesocrystal growth and the choice of structural motif; the impact on magnetic properties is discussed.

         <title>Emergent Magnetic States and Tunable Exchange Bias at 3d Nitride Heterointerfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;quality single&#8208;crystalline ferromagnetic Fe3N thin films and heterostructures with precisely controlled thickness are fabricated. A strong in&#8208;plane magnetic anisotropy and reversal of anomalous Hall resistance are observed when its thickness exceeds 5 unit&#8208;cells.

Interfacial magnetism stimulates the discovery of giant magnetoresistance (MR) and spin&#8211;orbital coupling across the heterointerfaces, facilitating the intimate correlation between spin transport and complex magnetic structures. Over decades, functional heterointerfaces composed of nitrides have seldom been explored due to the difficulty in synthesizing high&#8208;quality nitride films with correct compositions. Here, the fabrication of single&#8208;crystalline ferromagnetic Fe3N thin films with precisely controlled thicknesses is reported. As film thickness decreases, the magnetization dramatically deteriorates, and the electronic state changes from metallic to insulating. Strikingly, the high&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism is maintained in a Fe3N layer with a thickness down to 2&#160;u.c. (&#8776;8&#160;&#197;). The MR exhibits a strong in&#8208;plane anisotropy; meanwhile, the anomalous Hall resistivity&#160;reverses its sign when the Fe3N layer thickness exceeds 5&#160;u.c. Furthermore, a sizable exchange bias is observed at the interfaces between a ferromagnetic Fe3N and an antiferromagnetic CrN. The exchange bias field and saturation moment strongly depend on the controllable bending curvature using the cylinder diameter engineering technique, implying the tunable magnetic states under lattice deformation. This work provides a guideline for exploring functional nitride films and applying their interfacial phenomena for innovative perspectives toward practical applications.

&lt;p&gt;High-quality single-crystalline ferromagnetic Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N thin films and heterostructures with precisely controlled thickness are fabricated. A strong in-plane magnetic anisotropy and reversal of anomalous Hall resistance are observed when its thickness exceeds 5 unit-cells.

         <title>A Totipotent &#8220;All&#8208;In&#8208;One&#8221; Peptide Sequentially Blocks Immune Checkpoint and Reverses the Immunosuppressive Tumor Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A totipotent &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; peptide can transform into &#945;&#8208;helix in response to the tumor microenvironment. It possesses the abilities of self&#8208;assembling, blocking the PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1&#160;axis, inhibiting Rbm38&#8208;eIF4E complex formation, and activating p53.








Abstract
Immune checkpoint blockade combined with reversal of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) can dramatically enhance anti&#8208;tumor immunity, which can be achieved by using multiple&#8208;agent therapy. However, the optimal dose and order of administration of different agents remain elusive. To address this dilemma, multiple agents are often grafted together to construct &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; totipotent drugs, but this usually comes at the cost of a lack of synergy between the agents. Herein, by comprehensively analyzing the conserved sites of the immune checkpoint and TME drug targets, peptide secondary structures, assembly properties, and other physicochemical properties, a high&#8208;content peptide library is designed. By using the &#8220;3D&#8208;molecular&#8208;evolution&#8221; screening strategy, an efficient and totipotent &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; peptide (TAP) is obtained, which possesses the abilities of self&#8208;assembling, blocking the PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1&#160;axis, inhibiting Rbm38&#8208;eIF4E complex formation, and activating p53. It is shown that in mice treated with TAP, with either subcutaneous tumors or patient&#8208;derived xenografts, PD&#8208;L1&#160;is blocked, with increased activation of both T and NK cells whilst reversing the immunosuppressive TME. Moreover, TAP can mitigate tumor activity and suppress tumor growth, showing superior therapeutic effect over antibody&#8208;based drugs.

         <title>Unravelling the Interfacial Dynamics of Bandgap Funneling in Bismuth&#8208;Based Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interfacial dynamics and electrochemical interactions of hybrid perovskites prepared by an anion&#8208;exchange process in the photoelectrochemical system is investigated through computational simulation, experimental photophysical, and (photo)electrochemical analysis. The synergically interfacial dynamics and electrochemical analysis help to discover the intrinsic and interfacial properties of semiconductor materials.








Abstract
An environmentally friendly mixed&#8208;halide perovskite MA3Bi2Cl9&#8722;xIx with a bandgap funnel structure has been developed. However, the dynamic interfacial interactions of bandgap funneling in MA3Bi2Cl9&#8722;xIx perovskites in the photoelectrochemical (PEC) system remain ambiguous. In light of this, single&#8208; and mixed&#8208;halide lead&#8208;free bismuth&#8208;based hybrid perovskites&#8212;MA3Bi2Cl9&#8722;yIy and MA3Bi2I9 (named MBCl&#8208;I and MBI)&#8212;in the presence and absence of the bandgap funnel structure, respectively, are prepared. Using temperature&#8208;dependent transient photoluminescence and electrochemical voltammetric techniques, the photophysical and (photo)electrochemical phenomena of solid&#8211;solid and solid&#8211;liquid interfaces for MBCl&#8208;I and MBI halide perovskites are therefore confirmed. Concerning the mixed&#8208;halide hybrid perovskites MBCl&#8208;I with a bandgap funnel structure, stronger electronic coupling arising from an enhanced overlap of electronic wavefunctions results in more efficient exciton transport. Besides, MBCl&#8208;I's effective diffusion coefficient and electron&#8208;transfer rate demonstrate efficient heterogeneous charge transfer at the solid&#8211;liquid interface, generating improved photoelectrochemical hydrogen production. Consequently, this combination of photophysical and electrochemical techniques opens up an avenue to explore the intrinsic and interfacial properties of semiconductor materials for elucidating the correlation between material characterization and device performance.

         <title>Solar&#8208;Driven Reversible Hydrogen Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concept is demonstrated to achieve solar&#8208;driven reversible hydrogen storage of metal hydrides via coupling the photothermal effect and catalytic role of Cu nanoparticles uniformly distributed on the surface of MXene nanosheets. Induced by this synergistic effect, a reversible hydrogen storage capacity of 5.9&#160;wt% is achieved for MgH2 after 30 cycles.








Abstract
The lack of safe and efficient hydrogen storage is a major bottleneck for large&#8208;scale application of hydrogen energy. Reversible hydrogen storage of light&#8208;weight metal hydrides with high theoretical gravimetric and volumetric hydrogen density is one ideal solution but requires extremely high operating temperature with large energy input. Herein, taking MgH2 as an example, a concept is demonstrated to achieve solar&#8208;driven reversible hydrogen storage of metal hydrides via coupling the photothermal effect and catalytic role of Cu nanoparticles uniformly distributed on the surface of MXene nanosheets (Cu@MXene). The photothermal effect of Cu@MXene, coupled with the &#8220;heat isolator&#8221; role of MgH2 indued by its poor thermal conductivity, effectively elevates the temperature of MgH2 upon solar irradiation. The &#8220;hydrogen pump&#8221; effect of Ti and TiHx species that are in situ formed on the surface of MXene from the reduction of MgH2, on the other hand, plays a catalytic role in effectively alleviating the kinetic barrier and hence decreasing the operating temperature required for reversible hydrogen adsorption and desorption of MgH2. Based on the combination of photothermal and catalytic effect of Cu@MXene, a reversible hydrogen storage capacity of 5.9&#160;wt% is achieved for MgH2 after 30 cycles using solar irradiation as the only energy source.

Inspired by the respiration systems of organisms, highly efficient transport and transformation of biomacromolecular substances are achieved through the thermo&#8208;stimulated active &#8220;inhalation&#8211;exhalation&#8221; cycles of hierarchically structured smart DNA hydrogels. The application of active &#8220;inhalation&#8211;exhalation&#8221; cycles in the poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide)&#8211;DNA hydrogels improves the catalytic efficiency of the incorporated DNAzyme or CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a systems by up to 280% or 390%, respectively.








Abstract
Although smart hydrogels hold great promise in biosensing and biomedical applications, their response to external stimuli is governed by the passive diffusion&#8208;dependent substance transport between hydrogels and environments and within the 3D hydrogel matrices, resulting in slow response to biomacromolecules and limiting their extensive applications. Herein, inspired by the respiration systems of organisms, an active strategy to achieve highly efficient biomolecular substance transport through the thermo&#8208;stimulated &#8220;inhalation&#8211;exhalation&#8221; cycles of hydrogel matrices is demonstrated. The cryo&#8208;structured poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAM)&#8211;DNA hydrogels, composed of functional DNA&#8208;tethered pNIPAM networks and free&#8208;water&#8208;containing macroporous channels, exhibit thermally triggered fast and reversible shrinking/swelling cycles with high&#8208;volume changes, which drive the formation of dynamic water stream to accelerate the intake of external substances and expelling of endogenous substances, thus promoting the functional properties of hydrogel systems. Demonstrated by catalytic DNAzyme and CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a&#8208;incorporating hydrogels, significantly enhanced catalytic efficiency with up to 280% and 390% is achieved, upon the introduction of active &#8220;inhalation&#8211;exhalation&#8221; cycles, respectively. Moreover, remotely near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;triggering of &#8220;inhalation&#8211;exhalation&#8221; cycles is achieved after the introduction of NIR&#8208;responsive MXene nanosheets into the hydrogel matrix. These hydrogel systems with enhanced substance transport and transformation properties hold promise in the development of more effective biosensing and therapeutic systems.

         <title>Braiding Lateral Morphotropic Grain Boundaries in Homogenetic Oxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Morphotropic grain boundaries (GBs) in laterally interconnected cobaltite homostructures are achieved. Single&#8208;crystalline substrates and suspended freestanding membranes provide independent templates for coherent epitaxy and constraints on the growth orientation and strain, resulting in seamless and atomically sharp GBs. This work provides a feasible strategy for exploring potential device applications.








Abstract
Interfaces formed by correlated oxides offer a critical avenue for discovering emergent phenomena and quantum states. However, the fabrication of oxide interfaces with variable crystallographic orientations and strain states integrated along a film plane is extremely challenging&#160;by conventional layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer stacking or self&#8208;assembling. Here, the creation of morphotropic grain boundaries (GBs) in laterally interconnected cobaltite homostructures is reported. Single&#8208;crystalline substrates and suspended ultrathin freestanding membranes provide independent templates for coherent epitaxy and constraint on the growth orientation, resulting in seamless and atomically sharp GBs. Electronic states and magnetic behavior in hybrid structures are laterally modulated and isolated by GBs, enabling artificially engineered functionalities in the planar matrix. This work offers a simple and scalable method for fabricating unprecedented innovative interfaces through controlled synthesis routes as well as providing a platform for exploring potential applications in neuromorphics, solid&#8208;state batteries, and catalysis.

         <title>Boosting Perovskite Solar Cells Efficiency and Stability: Interfacial Passivation of Crosslinked Fullerene Eliminates the &#8220;Burn&#8208;in&#8221; Decay</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Li+ ion migration induced &#8220;burn&#8208;in&#8221; degradation in n&#8208;i&#8208;p type perovskite solar cells is reported. To block the Li+ ion movement, a thin cross&#8208;linked [6,6]&#8208;phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric acid methyl ester layer is introduced on top of the SnO2 layer, resulting in Li+ immobilization. Finally, the efficiency and stability are significantly improved.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) longevity is nowadays the bottleneck for their full commercial exploitation. Although lot of research is ongoing, the initial decay of the output power &#8211; an effect known as &#8220;burn&#8208;in&#8221; degradation happening in the first 100&#160;h &#8211; is still unavoidable, significantly reducing the overall performance (typically of &gt;20%). In this paper, the origin of the &#8220;burn&#8208;in&#8221; degradation in n&#8208;i&#8208;p type PSCs is demonstrated that is directly related to Li+ ions migration coming from the SnO2 electron transporting layer visualized by time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF&#8208;SIMS) measurements. To block the ion movement, a thin cross&#8208;linked [6,6]&#8208;phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric acid methyl ester layer on top of the SnO2 layer is introduced, resulting in Li+ immobilization. This results in the elimination of the &#8220;burn&#8208;in&#8221; degradation, showing for the first time a zero &#8220;burn&#8208;in&#8221; loss in the performances while boosting device power conversion efficiency to &gt;22% for triple&#8208;cation&#8208;based PSCs and &gt;24% for formamidinium&#8208;based (FAPbI3) PSCs, proving the general validity of this approach and creating a new framework for the realization of stable PSCs devices.

         <title>High Entropy Approach to Engineer Strongly Correlated Functionalities in Manganites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study introduces a new approach to materials design based on the inherent magneto&#8208;electronic inhomogeneities present in high entropy (HE) materials to manipulate and enhance strongly correlated functionalities in oxide systems. In this case study, substantial degree of colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) and unique lattice imperfections are observed in charge&#8208;doped HE&#8208;manganites.








Abstract
Technologically relevant strongly correlated phenomena such as colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) and metal&#8208;insulator transitions (MIT) exhibited by perovskite manganites are driven and enhanced by the coexistence of multiple competing magneto&#8208;electronic phases. Such magneto&#8208;electronic inhomogeneity is governed by the intrinsic lattice&#8208;charge&#8208;spin&#8208;orbital correlations, which, in turn, are conventionally tailored in manganites via chemical substitution, charge doping, or strain engineering. Alternately, the recently discovered high entropy oxides (HEOs), owing to the presence of multiple&#8208;principal cations on a given sub&#8208;lattice, exhibit indications of an inherent magneto&#8208;electronic phase separation encapsulated in a single crystallographic phase. Here, the high entropy (HE) concept is combined with standard property control by hole doping in a series of single&#8208;phase orthorhombic HE&#8208;manganites (HE&#8208;Mn), (Gd0.25La0.25Nd0.25Sm0.25)1&#8208;xSrxMnO3 (x&#160;=&#160;0&#8211;0.5). High&#8208;resolution transmission microscopy reveals hitherto&#8208;unknown lattice imperfections in HEOs: twins, stacking faults, and missing planes. Magnetometry and electrical measurements infer three distinct ground states&#8212;insulating antiferromagnetic, unpercolated metallic ferromagnetic, and long&#8208;range metallic ferromagnetic&#8212;coexisting or/and competing as a result of hole doping and multi&#8208;cation complexity. Consequently, CMR &#8776;1550% stemming from an MIT is observed in polycrystalline pellets, matching the best&#8208;known values for bulk conventional manganites. Hence, this initial case study highlights the potential for a synergetic development of strongly correlated oxides offered by the high entropy design approach.

         <title>Large Magneto&#8208;Transverse and Longitudinal Thermoelectric Effects in the Magnetic Weyl Semimetal TbPtBi</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Huge magneto&#8208;transverse and longitudinal power factors are simultaneously detected in the magnetic Weyl semimetal TbPtBi. This can be ascribed to the magnetic field&#8208;enhanced transverse and longitudinal thermopower induced by bipolar effect, and large Hall angle related to the large net Berry curvature and high carrier mobility, and the incompletely compensated charge carriers and large transverse magnetoresistance, respectively.








Abstract
Magnetic topological semimetals provide new opportunities for power generation and solid&#8208;state cooling based on thermoelectric (TE) effect. The interplay between magnetism and nontrivial band topology prompts the magnetic topological semimetals to yield strong transverse TE effect, while the longitudinal TE performance is usually poor. Herein, it is demonstrated that the magnetic Weyl semimetal TbPtBi has high value for both transverse and longitudinal thermopower with large power factor (PF). At 300&#160;K and 13.5&#160;Tesla, the transverse thermopower and PF reach up to 214&#160;&#181;V&#160;K&#8722;1 and 35&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;2, respectively, which are comparable to those of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art TE materials. Combining first&#8208;principles calculations, longitudinal magnetoresistance and planar Hall resistance measurements, and two&#8208;band model fitting, the large transverse thermopower and PF are attributed to both bipolar effect and large Hall angle. Moreover, the imperfectly compensated charge carriers and large transverse magnetoresistance induce the maximum magneto&#8208;longitudinal thermopower of 251&#160;&#181;V&#160;K&#8722;1 with a PF of 24&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;2 at 150&#160;K and 13.5&#160;Tesla, which is two times higher than that at zero magnetic field. This work demonstrates the great potential of topological semimetals for TEs and offers a new excellent candidate for magneto&#8208;TEs.

         <title>A MoS2 Hafnium Oxide Based Ferroelectric Encoder for Temporal&#8208;Efficient Spiking Neural Network</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A temporal&#8208;efficient noise&#8208;resilient ferroelectric encoder, exploiting the time&#8208;to&#8208;first&#8208;spike encoding scheme, is proposed for information preprocessing in spiking neural networks.&#160;Our&#160;device manifests prominent ferroelectric dynamics, showing an excellent classification accuracy of 95.14%, in addition to resilience against noise attacks. This work manifests the potential to enable spike&#8208;driven computations for energy&#8208;efficient machine learning and artificial intelligence.








Abstract
Spiking neural network (SNN), where the information is evaluated recurrently through spikes, has manifested significant promises to minimize the energy expenditure in data&#8208;intensive machine learning and artificial intelligence. Among these applications, the artificial neural encoders are essential to convert the external stimuli to a spiking format that can be subsequently fed to the neural network. Here, a molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) hafnium oxide&#8208;based ferroelectric encoder is demonstrated for temporal&#8208;efficient information processing in SNN. The fast domain switching attribute associated with the polycrystalline nature of hafnium oxide&#8208;based ferroelectric material is exploited for spike encoding, rendering it suitable for realizing biomimetic encoders. Accordingly, a high&#8208;performance ferroelectric encoder is achieved, featuring a superior switching efficiency, negligible charge trapping effect, and robust ferroelectric response, which successfully enable a broad dynamic range. Furthermore, an SNN is simulated to verify the precision of the encoded information, in which an average inference accuracy of 95.14% can be achieved, using the Modified National Insitute of Standards and Technology&#160;(MNIST) dataset for digit classification. Moreover, this ferroelectric encoder manifests prominent resilience against noise injection with an overall prediction accuracy of 94.73% under various Gaussian noise levels, showing practical promises to reduce the computational load for the neural network.

         <title>Mixed&#8208;Dimensional Pt&#8211;Ni Alloy Polyhedral Nanochains as Bifunctional Electrocatalysts for Direct Methanol Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mixed&#8208;dimensional Pt&#8211;Ni nanostructures, consisting of ordered nanopolyhedra&#8211;nanowires&#8211;nanopolyhedra, are designed and prepared for efficient dual&#8208;function application in direct methanol fuel cells. The nanostructure enjoys the advantages of both the optimal catalytic activity of 0D nanopolyhedra and the robust catalytic stability of 1D nanowires, and also compensates for the nonuniformity of catalytic activity and catalytic stability caused by the size effect.








Abstract
Pt nanocatalysts play a critical role in direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) due to their appropriate adsorption/desorption energy, yet suffer from an unbalanced relationship between size&#8208;dependent activity and stability. Herein, mixed&#8208;dimensional Pt&#8211;Ni alloy polyhedral nanochains (Pt&#8211;Ni PNCs) with an ordered assembly of a nanopolyhedra&#8211;nanowire&#8211;nanopolyhedra architecture are fabricated as bifunctional electrocatalysts for DMFCs, effectively alleviating the size effect. The Pt&#8211;Ni PNCs exhibit 7.23 times higher mass activity for the anodic methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) than that of commercial Pt/C. In situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and CO stripping measurements demonstrate the prominent stability of the Pt&#8211;Ni PNCs to resist CO poisoning. For the cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), a positive half&#8208;wave potential exceeding Pt/C is achieved by the Pt&#8211;Ni PNCs, and it can be well maintained for 10&#160;000 cycles with negligible activity decay. The designed nanostructure can alleviate the agglomeration and dissolution problems of 0D small&#8208;sized Pt&#8211;Ni alloy nanocrystals and enrich surface atom steps and active facets of 1D chain&#8208;like nanostructures. This work provides a proposed strategy to improve the catalytic performance of Pt&#8208;based nanocatalysts by constructing novel interfacial relationships in mixed dimensions to alleviate the imbalance between catalytic activity and catalytic stability caused by size effects.

         <title>A Demulsification&#8211;Crystallization Model for High&#8208;Quality Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A demulsification&#8208;crystallization (D&#8211;C) model is constructed to describe the crystallization process of the perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs). Furtherly, a multiple&#8208;acid&#8208;anion synergistic assisted strategy is designed to optimize the D&#8211;C model for high&#8208;quality PNCs. Finally, the green light&#8208;emitting diodes based on the PNCs achieved EQE of 22.5%.








Abstract
A room&#8208;temperature technique with all&#8208;nonpolar&#8208;solvent, which circumvents the sensitivity of ionic perovskite to polar solvent, has become attractive for the synthesis of metal halide perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs). However, the lack of understanding of the inner mechanism, especially for the state of the precursor and the crystallization process of the PNCs, hinders further development of this technique. Here, through systematic study of the Pb precursor and in situ characterization of the PNCs, it is revealed that the reverse micelle nature of the Pb precursor exactly creates a novel demulsification&#8208;crystallization (D&#8211;C) model, namely, a two&#8208;stage nucleation is divided by a demulsification process for the PNCs. On this basis, a top efficiency for green light&#8208;emitting diodes based on PNCs is obtained with a maximum external quantum efficiency of 22.5% through tailoring the D&#8211;C model using a multiple&#8208;acid&#8208;anion synergistic assisted strategy to obtain high&#8208;quality PNCs. Beyond the high efficiency, the work paves the way for diverse ideas in PNC synthesis.

         <title>Skyrmions Under Control&#8212;FIB Irradiation as a Versatile Tool for Skyrmion Circuits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel way to guide the motion and control the nucleation of skyrmions, magnetic bubbles envisioned for next&#8208;generation spintronic data storage and computation, by means of local ion irradiation, is presented. It is shown that ion irradiation with an optimized dose can create repulsive barriers and even nucleation centers for skyrmions.








Abstract
Magnetic data storage and processing offer certain advances over conventional technologies, amongst which nonvolatility and low power operation are the most outstanding ones. Skyrmions are a promising candidate as a magnetic data carrier. However, the sputtering of skyrmion films and the control of the skyrmion nucleation, motion, and annihilation remains challenging. This work demonstrates&#160;that using optimized focused ion beam irradiation and annealing protocols enables the skyrmion phase in W/CoFeB/MgO thin films to be accessed easily. By analyzing ion&#8208;beam&#8208;engineered skyrmion hosting wires, excited by sub&#8208;100 ns current pulses, possibilities to control skyrmion nucleation, guide their motion, and control their annihilation unfold. Overall, the key elements needed to develop extensive skyrmion networks are presented.

&lt;p&gt;A novel way to guide the motion and control the nucleation of skyrmions, magnetic bubbles envisioned for next-generation spintronic data storage and computation, by means of local ion irradiation, is presented. It is shown that ion irradiation with an optimized dose can create repulsive barriers and even nucleation centers for skyrmions.

         <title>A Switchable One&#8208;Compound Diode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
With Ag18Cu3Te11Cl3, a material for the first one&#8208;compound diode is discovered. A temperature&#8208;gradient driven pn&#8208;junction is realized in a single crystal where p&#8208; and n&#8208;type conduction is accessed without external doping. The transition close to room temperature enables a variety of semiconductor applications.








Abstract
A diode requires the combination of p&#8208; and n&#8208;type semiconductors or at least the defined formation of such areas within a given compound. This is a prerequisite for any IT application, energy conversion technology, and electronic semiconductor devices. Since the discovery of the pnp&#8208;switchable compound Ag10Te4Br3 in 2009, it is in principle possible to fabricate a diode from a single material without adjusting the semiconduction type by a defined doping level. Often a structural phase transition accompanied by a dynamic change of charge carriers or a charge density wave within certain substructures are responsible for this effect. Unfortunately, the high pnp&#8208;switching temperature between 364 and 580 K hinders the application of this phenomenon in convenient devices. This effect is far removed from a suitable operation temperature at ambient conditions. Ag18Cu3Te11Cl3&#160;is a room temperature pnp&#8208;switching material and the first single&#8208;material position&#8208;independent diode. It shows the highest ever reported Seebeck coefficient drop that takes place within a few Kelvin. Combined with its low thermal conductivity, it offers great application potential within an accessible and applicable temperature window. Ag18Cu3Te11Cl3 and pnp&#8208;switching materials have the potential for applications and processes where diodes, transistors, or any defined charge separation with junction formation are utilized.

         <title>Heterogeneous Strain Distribution Based Programmable Gated Microchannel for Ultrasensitive and Stable Strain Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the ion channels in living organisms, discretely distributed laterally free micropillars are introduced into the fluidic channel to act as the gates and construct a gated strain sensor with the conductive liquid infiltrated within the gaps, obtaining a high gauge factor of up to 45&#8201;300, wide broad range of 590%, and great stability of 90&#8201;000&#160;drift&#8208;free cycling tests.








Abstract
Developing highly sensitive strain sensors requires conduction pathways capable of rapidly switching between disconnection and reconnection in response to strain. Ion channels in living organisms exactly control the channel switch through protein&#8208;composed gates, achieving changeable ion currents. Herein, inspired by the gating characteristics of the ion channels, a programmable fluidic strain sensor enhanced by gating ion pathways through heterogeneous strain distribution of discrete micropillars is proposed. During stretching, the contraction and closure of the widthwise gaps between discrete micropillars greatly weaken or even nearly cut off the conduction pathway, resulting in orders of magnitude increase in resistance and thus ultrahigh sensitivity. By adjusting the combination form and structural parameters of the discrete micropillars in the fluidic channel, the sensitivity and strain range can be customized. Thus, a gauge factor&#160;of up to 45&#160;300&#160;and a stretch range of 590% are obtained. Benefiting from the fluidic gating mechanism, no mechanical mismatch can be observed at the interface, breaking through the sensing stability issue of flexible sensors. The proposed sensor can be used to detect the full range of human motion, and integrated into a data glove to achieve human&#8211;machine interaction.

         <title>Dynamic Epitaxial Growth of Organic Heterostructures for Polarized Exciton Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through regulating the location of the dynamic epitaxial growth, a stepwise seeded growth approach is demonstrated for the organic low&#8208;dimensional heterostructures with a hierarchical spatial organization, such as triblock, core/shell, and axial&#8208;branch heterostructures. Moreover, these prepared organic heterostructures can be used in the micro/nanoscale multiple in/output optical logic gates.








Abstract
Highly spatial and angular precision in epitaxial&#8208;growth process is crucial for constructing organic low&#8208;dimensional heterostructures (OLDHs) with the desired substructures, which remains significant challenge owing to the unpredicted location of complex heterogeneous nucleation. Herein, a dynamic epitaxial&#8208;growth approach is developed along the tailored longitudinal/horizontal directions to create diverse OLDHs with hierarchical architectures. The controlled morphology evolution of seed crystals from kinetic to thermodynamic species is achieved via incrementally increasing the crystallization time from 0 to 600&#160;s. Accordingly, the kinetic and thermodynamic seed crystals respectively present the specific lattice&#8208;matching crystal&#8208;planes of (100) and (011), which facilitates the longitudinal epitaxial&#8208;growth (LG) process for triblock heterostructures, and the horizontal epitaxial&#8208;growth (HG) process for axial&#8208;branch heterostructures. The dominant core/shell heterostructures are prepared via both LG and HG processes with a crystallization time of &#8776;30&#160;s. Significantly, these prepared OLDHs realize the rationally polarized exciton conversion for optical logic gate application through the exciton conversion and photon propagation at the heterojunction. This strategy provides an avenue for the precise synthesis of OLDHs with anisotropy optical characters for integrated optoelectronics.

         <title>Reconstruction of Thiospinel to Active Sites and Spin Channels for Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemical reconstruction of thiospinel CoFe2S4 evolves both oxyhydroxide species as active site and Fe3S4 component as spin channel, which is unique. The reconstructed CoFe2S4 shows state&#8208;of&#8208;art oxygen evolution reaction activity because of a strong magnetic anisotropy at the interface between oxyhydroxide and Fe3S4 components. The reconstructed configuration also benefits a robust performance in membrane electrolyzers.








Abstract
Water electrolysis is a promising technique for carbon neutral hydrogen production. A great challenge remains at developing robust and low&#8208;cost anode catalysts. Many pre&#8208;catalysts are found to undergo surface reconstruction to give high intrinsic activity in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The reconstructed oxyhydroxides on the surface are active species and most of them outperform directly synthesized oxyhydroxides. The reason for the high intrinsic activity remains to be explored. Here, a study is reported to showcase the unique reconstruction behaviors of a pre&#8208;catalyst, thiospinel CoFe2S4, and its reconstruction chemistry for a high OER activity. The reconstruction of CoFe2S4 gives a mixture with both Fe&#8211;S component and active oxyhydroxide (Co(Fe)OxHy) because Co is more inclined to reconstruct as oxyhydroxide, while the Fe is more stable in Fe&#8211;S component in a major form of Fe3S4. The interface spin channel is demonstrated in the reconstructed CoFe2S4, which optimizes the energetics of OER steps on Co(Fe)OxHy species and facilitates the spin sensitive electron transfer to reduce the kinetic barrier of O&#8211;O coupling. The advantage is also demonstrated in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzer. This work introduces the feasibility of engineering the reconstruction chemistry of the precatalyst for high performance and durable MEA electrolyzers.

The interface spin channel is demonstrated in the reconstructed CoFe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, which optimizes the energetics of OER steps on Co(Fe)O&lt;i&gt;

The advantage is also demonstrated in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzer.

2D colloidal self&#8208;assembly provides a simple strategy to produce functional nanostructure arrays. Regularity of the formed 2D crystal is essential to ensure functionality, but can be difficult to achieve in self&#8208;assembling systems. The acoustic crystallization of 2D crystals process provides a simple methodology to anneal interfacial colloidal monolayers by periodic extension of the interfacial area, creating long&#8208;range order over macroscopic dimensions.








Abstract
2D colloidal crystallization provides a simple strategy to produce defined nanostructure arrays over macroscopic areas. Regularity and long&#8208;range order of such crystals is essential to ensure functionality, but difficult to achieve in self&#8208;assembling systems. Here, a simple loudspeaker setup for the acoustic crystallization of 2D colloidal crystals (ACDC) of polystyrene, microgels, and core&#8211;shell particles at liquid interfaces is introduced. This setup anneals an interfacial colloidal monolayer and affords an increase in average grain size by almost two orders of magnitude. The order is characterized via the structural color of the colloidal crystal, the acoustic annealing process is optimized via the frequency and the amplitude of the applied sound wave, and its efficiency is rationalized via the surface coverage&#8208;dependent interactions within the interfacial colloidal monolayer. Computer simulations show that multiple rearrangement mechanisms at different length scales, from the local motion around voids to grain boundary movements via consecutive particle rotations around common centers, collude to remove defects. The experimentally simple ACDC process, paired with the demonstrated applicability toward complex particle systems, provides access to highly defined nanostructure arrays for a wide range of research communities.

         <title>Engineering Spin Configurations of Synthetic Antiferromagnet by Controlling Long&#8208;Range Oscillatory Interlayer Coupling and Neighboring Ferrimagnetic Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controllable manipulation of the inner spin configuration of the Pt/[Co/Pt/Co]/Ru/CoTb heterostructure is achieved by controlling long&#8208;range interlayer coupling and neighboring ferrimagnetic coupling. Based on controllable spin regulations, ferrimagnetic&#8208;based synesthetic antiferromagnetic devices with compensated magnetization, enhanced Hall resistance, and wide&#8208;temperature stable spin&#8208;orbit torque switching are realized, which are of great interest for the realistic spin&#8208;orbitronic applications.








Abstract
Controllable manipulation of specific spin configurations of magnetic materials is the key to constructing functional spintronic devices. Here, it is demonstrated by integrating the merits of ferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic, and antiferromagnetic spin configurations into one synthetic antiferromagnetic (SAF) heterostructure by controlling both long&#8208;range oscillatory interlayer coupling and neighboring ferrimagnetic coupling. A controllable manipulation of four types of spin configurations of the Pt/[Co/Pt/Co]/Ru/CoTb SAF heterostructures composed of ferromagnetic Co/Pt/Co and ferrimagnetic CoTb layers is successfully achieved. In particular, the compensated magnetization, enhanced anomalous Hall resistance in the remanence state, wide&#8208;temperature spin&#8208;orbit torque switching of magnetization, and high immunity to the external magnetic field are simultaneously obtained in one of the SAF heterojunctions with macroscopic interlayer antiferromagnetic coupling. This design concept of engineering spin configurations may enable efficient spin manipulation for customized memory and logic applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Aerogels: A New Platform for Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unique high&#8208;entropy alloy aerogels (HEAAs) with strong metal interactions and abundant unsaturated sites are constructed. Particularly, PdCuAuAgBiIn HEAAs achieve almost 100% of Faradaic efficiency (FE) for C1 products from &#8722;0.7 to &#8722;1.1&#160;V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and a maximum FE for formic acid of 98.1% at &#8722;1.1&#160;VRHE, showing a new class of electrocatalysts for CO2 electroreduction with potential practical applications.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy alloy aerogels (HEAAs) combined with the advantages of high&#8208;entropy alloys and aerogels are prospective new platforms in catalytic reactions. However, due to the differences in reduction potentials and miscibility behavior of different metals, the realization of HEAAs with a single phase is still a great challenge. Herein, a series of HEAAs is fabricated via the freeze&#8211;thaw method as highly active and durable electrocatalysts for the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). Especially, the PdCuAuAgBiIn HEAAs can achieve Faradaic efficiency (FE) of C1 products almost 100% from &#8722;0.7 to &#8722;1.1&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (VRHE), and a maximum FE for formic acid (FEHCOOH) of 98.1% at &#8722;1.1&#160;VRHE, outperforming PdCuAuAgBiIn high&#8208;entropy alloy particles (HEAPs) and Pd metallic aerogels (MAs). Specifically, the current density and FEHCOOH are almost 200&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and 87% in a flow cell. The impressive CO2RR performance of the PdCuAuAgBiIn HEAAs is attributed to the strong interactions between the different metals and the surface unsaturated sites, which can regulate the electronic structures of different metals and allow the optimal HCOO* intermediate adsorption and desorption onto the catalysts surface to enhance HCOOH production. The work not only provides a facile synthetic strategy to fabricate HEAAs, but also opens the avenue for development of efficient catalysts and beyond.

         <title>A Template Editing Strategy to Create Interlayer&#8208;Confined Active Species for Efficient and Durable Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interlayer&#8208;confined intercalated architecture is created by template editing, suppressing the undesirable &#947; to &#946; phase transformation and exhibiting efficient and durable oxygen evolution reaction activity. As a result, water oxidation can occur at an extremely low overpotential of 130&#160;mV and affords 1000&#160;h stability at 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Substantial overpotentials and insufficient and unstable active sites of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts limit their efficiency and stability in OER&#8208;related energy conversion and storage technologies. Here, a template editing strategy is proposed to graft highly active catalytic species onto highly conductive rigid frameworks to tackle this challenge. As a successful attempt, two types of NiO6 units of layered Ni BDC (BDC stands for 1,4&#8208;benzenedicarboxylic acid) metal organic frameworks are selectively edited by chemical etching&#8208;assisted electroxidation to create layered &#947;&#8208;NiOOH with intercalated Ni&#8211;O species. In such an interlayer&#8208;confined intercalated architecture, the large interlayer space with high ion permeability offers an ideal reaction region to sufficiently expose the OER active sites comprising high&#8208;density intercalated Ni&#8211;O species, which also suppresses the undesirable &#947; to &#946; phase transformation, thus exhibiting efficient and durable OER activity. As a result, water oxidation can occur at an extremely low overpotential of 130&#160;mV and affords 1000&#160;h stability at 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. The strategy conceptually shows the possibility of achieving stable homogeneous&#8208;like catalysis in heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Triggering ZT to 0.40 by Engineering Orientation in One Polymeric Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bimodal orientation of diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;based polymer films exhibits a figure of merit of 0.40, which is more than 400% superior to the corresponding values of face&#8208;on/edge&#8208;on unimodal films.








Abstract
Breaking the thermoelectric (TE) trade&#8208;off relationship is an important task for maximizing the TE performance of polymeric semiconductors. Existing efforts have focused on designing high&#8208;mobility semiconductors and achieving ordered molecular doping, ignoring the critical role of the molecular orientation during TE conversion. Herein, the achievement of ZT to 0.40 is reported by fine&#8208;tuning the molecular orientation of one diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)&#8208;based polymer (DPP&#8208;BTz). Films with bimodal molecular orientation yield superior doping efficiency by increasing the lamellar spacing and achieve increased splitting between the Fermi energy and the transport energy to enhance the thermopower. These factors contribute to the simultaneous improvement in the Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity in an unexpected manner. Importantly, the bimodal film exhibits a maximum power factor of up to 346 &#181;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2, &gt;400% higher than that of unimodal films. These results demonstrate the great potential of molecular orientation engineering in polymeric semiconductors for developing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art organic TE (OTE) materials.

         <title>In Situ Confinement of Ultrasmall Metal Nanoparticles in Short Mesochannels for Durable Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction with High Efficiency and Selectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal in situ confinement strategy is developed to synthesize ultrasmall metal nanoparticles in the mesochannels of 1D mesoporous carbon. The obtained catalysts show an impressive electrocatalytic NO3&#8722; reduction performance with nearly 100% conversion efficiency, 98% N2&#160;selectivity, 55% current efficiency, an ultralong cycling stability over 30&#160;days, and an ultrahigh removal capacity of 15&#8201;000&#160;mg&#160;N&#160;g&#8722;1 CuPd.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic reduction is a sustainable approach for NO3&#8722; removal and high&#8208;value N&#8208;containing compounds manufacturing, which, however, is strongly obstructed by sluggish kinetics, low selectivity, and poor stability. Herein, the in situ confinement of ultrasmall CuPd alloy nanoparticles in mesochannels of conductive core&#8211;shell structured carbon nanotubes@mesoporous carbon substrates (CNTs@mesoC@CuPd) via a simple molecule&#8208;mediated interfacial assembly method is reported. As a catalyst for electrocatalytic NO3&#8722; reduction, the CNTs@mesoC@CuPd shows a splendid conversion efficiency (100%), N2&#160;selectivity (98%), cycling stability (&gt;30&#160;days), and removal capacity as high as 30&#160;000&#160;mg&#160;N&#160;g&#8722;1 CuPd, which are much superior to most of the prior reports. Notably, experimental (in situ testing and isotopic labeling) and theoretical results unveil that bimetallic and monometallic catalysts for electrocatalytic NO3&#8722; reduction exhibit exclusive selectivity for N2&#160;and NH3, respectively. This in situ confinement strategy is universal for the synthesis of stable and highly accessible metallic catalysts, which opens an appealing way to synthesize advanced catalysts with high activity, selectivity, and stability.

         <title>Ultrafast Non&#8208;Equilibrium Synthesis of Cathode Materials for Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrafast high&#8208;temperature shock strategy is proposed to synthesize cathode materials in seconds for lithium&#8208;ion batteries, avoiding high energy and long time consumption. It provides an ultrahigh heating rate, leading to a non&#8208;equilibrium reaction and fast reaction kinetics. Mainstream cathode materials are successfully synthesized with pure phases, oxygen vacancies, ultrasmall particle sizes, and good electrochemical performance, indicative of a universal and efficient synthesis approach.








Abstract
The synthesis of cathode materials plays an important role in determining the production efficiency, cost, and performance of lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, conventional synthesis methods always experience a slow heating rate and involve a complicated multistep reaction process and sluggish reaction dynamics, leading to high energy and long time consumption. Herein, a high&#8208;temperature shock (HTS) strategy is reported for the ultrafast synthesis of cathode materials in seconds. The HTS process experiences an ultrahigh heating rate, leading to a non&#8208;equilibrium reaction and fast reaction kinetics, and avoids high energy and long time consumption. Mainstream cathode materials (such as LiMn2O4, LiCoO2, LiFePO4, and Li&#8208;rich layered oxide/NiO heterostructured material) are successfully synthesized with pure phases, oxygen vacancies, ultrasmall particle sizes, and good electrochemical performance. The HTS process not only provides an efficient synthesis approach for cathode materials, but also can be extended beyond lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Injectable Anti&#8208;Inflammatory Supramolecular Nanofiber Hydrogel to Promote Anti&#8208;VEGF Therapy in Age&#8208;Related Macular Degeneration Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An injectable antibody&#8208;loaded supramolecular nanofiber hydrogel is fabricated by mixing betamethasone phosphate (BetP), anti&#8208;vascular endothelial growth factor (anti&#8208;VEGF), with CaCl2. Such a BetP hydrogel based on all clinically approved agents can prolong the effective treatment time of conventional anti&#8208;VEGF therapy, and may be readily translated into clinical use for age&#8208;related macular degeneration treatment, with the potential to replace the current therapy.








Abstract
Age&#8208;related macular degeneration (AMD) is a major cause of visual impairment and severe vision loss worldwide, while the currently available treatments are often unsatisfactory. Previous studies have demonstrated both inflammation and oxidative&#8208;stress&#8208;induced damage to the retinal pigment epithelium are involved in the pathogenesis of aberrant development of blood vessels in wet AMD (wet&#8208;AMD). Although antivascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy (e.g., Ranibizumab) can impair the growth of new blood vessels, side effects are still found with repeated monthly intravitreal injections. Here, an injectable antibody&#8208;loaded supramolecular nanofiber hydrogel is fabricated by simply mixing betamethasone phosphate (BetP), a clinic anti&#8208;inflammatory drug, anti&#8208;VEGF, the gold&#8208;standard anti&#8208;VEGF drug for AMD treatment, with CaCl2. Upon intravitreal injection, such BetP&#8208;based hydrogel (BetP&#8208;Gel),&#160;while enabling long&#8208;term sustained release of anti&#8208;VEGF to inhibit vascular proliferation in the retina and attenuate choroidal neovascularization, can also scavenge reactive oxygen species to reduce local inflammation. Remarkably, such BetP&#8208;Gel can dramatically prolong the effective treatment time of conventional anti&#8208;VEGF therapy. Notably, anti&#8208;VEGF&#8208;loaded supramolecular hydrogel based on all clinically approved agents may be readily translated into clinical use for AMD treatment, with the potential to replace the current anti&#8208;VEGF therapy.

         <title>Panoramic Mapping of Phonon Transport from Ultrafast Electron Diffraction and Scientific Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The integrated experimental&#8208;machine learning framework that extracts crucial hidden phonon thermal transport properties from ultrafast diffraction. The phonon transport results in local atomic vibrations that further links to the time&#8208;dependent diffraction intensities. By using adjoint&#8208;state scientific machine learning approach to solve the inverse thermal transport containing thousands of coupled differential equations, the hidden phonon properties can be reliably uncovered.








Abstract

&lt;p&gt;The integrated experimental-machine learning framework that extracts crucial hidden phonon thermal transport properties from ultrafast diffraction. The phonon transport results in local atomic vibrations that further links to the time-dependent diffraction intensities. By using adjoint-state scientific machine learning approach to solve the inverse thermal transport containing thousands of coupled differential equations, the hidden phonon properties can be reliably uncovered.

         <title>3D&#8208;Printed Prolamin Scaffolds for Cell&#8208;Based Meat Culture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Edible prolamin scaffolds with a highly ordered tessellated structure are printed based on the electrohydrodynamic printing technique after formulating food&#8208;grade zein/hordein and zein/secalin inks. Mouse skeletal myoblasts and porcine skeletal muscle satellite cells show favorable cellular activities on the prepared fibrous matrix, demonstrating the great potential of prolamin scaffolds in cultured meat production.








Abstract
Cultivating meat from muscle stem cells in vitro requires 3D edible scaffolds as the supporting matrix. Electrohydrodynamic (EHD) printing is an emerging 3D&#8208;printing technology for fabricating ultrafine fibrous scaffolds with high precision microstructures for biomedical applications. However, edible EHD&#8208;printed scaffolds remain scarce in cultured meat (CM) production partly due to special requirements with regard to the printability of ink. Here, hordein or secalin is mixed, which are cereal prolamins extracted from barley or rye, with zein to produce pure prolamin&#8208;based inks, which exhibit favorable printability similar to common polycaprolactone ink. Zein/hordein and zein/secalin scaffolds with highly ordered tessellated structures are successfully fabricated after optimizing printing conditions. The prolamin scaffolds demonstrated good water stability and in vitro degradability due to the porous fiber surface, which is spontaneously generated by culturing muscle cells for 1&#160;week. Moreover, mouse skeletal myoblasts (C2C12) and porcine skeletal muscle satellite cells (PSCs) can adhere and proliferate on the fibrous matrix, and a CM slice is produced by culturing PSCs on prolamin scaffolds with high tissue similarity. The upregulation of myogenic proteins shows that the differentiation process is triggered in the 3D culture, demonstrating the great potential of prolamin scaffolds in CM production.

         <title>Dynamic Sustainable Polyimide Film Combining Hardness with Softness via a &#8220;Mimosa&#8208;Like&#8221; Bionic Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic polyimide (PI) film, which can transform among three molecular structures,&#160;is designed by imitating the behavior of the Mimosa plant. The PI film is a super&#8208;corona&#8208;resistant film, a matrix of high&#8208;sensitivity humidity sensor and carbon&#8208;fiber&#8208;reinforced composites due to its excellent capabilities of degradation, self&#8208;healable ability, and recyclability.








Abstract
Dielectric polyimides (PIs)&#160;are ubiquitous as insulation in electrical power systems and electronic devices. Generally, dynamic polyimide is required to solve irreversible failure processes of electrical or mechanical damage, for example, under high temperature, pressure, and field strength. The challenge lies in the design of the molecular structure of rigid polyimide to achieve dynamic reversibility. Herein, a low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polyimide gene unit is designed to crosslink with polyimide ligase to prepare the smart film. Interestingly, due to the variability of gene unit and ligase combinations, the polyimide films combining hardness with softness are designed into three forms via a &#8220;Mimosa&#8208;like&#8221; bionic strategy to adapt to different application scenarios. Meanwhile, the films have good degradation efficiency, excellent recyclability, and can be self&#8208;healable, which makes them reuse. Clearly, the films can be used in the preparation of ultrafast sensors with a response time &#8776;0.15 s and the application of corona&#8208;resistant films with 100% recovery. Furthermore, the construction of polyimide and carbon&#8208;fiber&#8208;reinforced composites (CFRCs) has been verified to apply to the worse environment. Nicely, the composites have the property of multiple cycles and the non&#8208;destructive recycle rate of carbon fiber (CF) is as high as 100%. The design idea of preparing high&#8208;strength dynamic polyimide by crosslinking simple polyimide gene unit with ligase could provide a good foundation and a clear case for the sustainable development of electrical and electronic polyimides, from the perspective of Mimosa bionics.

Semiconductor Devices
In article 2208698, Janio Venturini, Tom Nilges, and co&#8208;workers report on the first position&#8208; and direction&#8208;flexible diode made solely from Ag18Cu3Te11Cl3. A temperature gradient of a few degrees around room temperature is sufficient to switch between p&#8208; and n&#8208;type conduction, controlling the existence, position, and current flow direction in the device.

Interfacial Dynamics
In article number 2207835, Hsien&#8208;Yi Hsu and co&#8208;workers systematically study interfacial dynamics of bandgap funnelling in MA3Bi2Cl9&#8722;xIx perovskites using temperature&#8208;dependent transient photoluminescence and electrochemical voltammetric techniques. The photophysical and (photo)electrochemical phenomena of solid&#8211;solid and solid&#8211;liquid interfaces are therefore confirmed. The importance of this work is to explore the intrinsic and interfacial properties of semiconductor materials for elucidating the correlation between material characterization and device performance.

Magnetite Mesocrystals
Mesocrystals are a class of nanostructured materials where a multiple&#8208;length&#8208;scale  structure is a prerequisite of many interesting phenomena. In article number 2207130, Aleksandra Chumakova, Elena V. Sturm, Alexe&#239; Bosak, and co&#8208;workers describe the detailed analysis of X&#8208;ray diffraction from magnetite mesocrystals with different particle sizes and shapes, in tandem with electron microscopy. The revealed features provide valuable  input to the models of mesocrystal growth.

Strain Sensing
In article number 2207141, Yongsong Luo, Xiaoliang Chen, Jinyou Shao, and co&#8208;workers propose a gated microchannel&#8208;based strain&#8208;sensing strategy inspired by ion channels in living organisms. Discretely distributed micropillars are introduced into fluidic channels to act as smart gates, which can nearly cut off the ion pathways during contraction and closure, resulting in ultrahigh sensitivity and robust stability.

         <title>All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Thin Film Lithium/Lithium&#8208;Ion Microbatteries for Powering the Internet of Things</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state thin film lithium/lithium&#8208;ion microbatteries (TFBs) are regarded as the ideal on&#8208;chip power sources for powering the microelectronic devices in Internet of Things. Recent progress in preparation techniques, materials design, interface modification, strategy for improving energy density, and multiple functionalities of TFBs is comprehensively summarized and discussed, and an overview of challenges and future perspectives is provided.








Abstract
As the world steps into the era of Internet of Things (IoT), numerous miniaturized electronic devices requiring autonomous micropower sources will be connected to the internet. All&#8208;solid&#8208;state thin&#8208;film lithium/lithium&#8208;ion microbatteries (TFBs) combining solid&#8208;state battery architecture and thin&#8208;film manufacturing are regarded as ideal on&#8208;chip power sources for IoT&#8208;enabled microelectronic devices. However, unlike commercialized lithium&#8208;ion batteries, TFBs are still in the immature state, and new advances in materials, manufacturing, and structure are required to improve their performance. In this review, the current status and existing challenges of TFBs for practical application in internet&#8208;connected devices for the IoT are discussed. Recent progress in thin&#8208;film deposition, electrode and electrolyte materials, interface modification, and 3D architecture design is comprehensively summarized and discussed, with emphasis on state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategies to improve the areal capacity and cycling stability of TFBs. Moreover, to be suitable power sources for IoT devices, the design of next&#8208;generation TFBs should consider multiple functionalities, including wide working temperature range, good flexibility, high transparency, and integration with energy&#8208;harvesting systems. Perspectives on designing practically accessible TFBs are provided, which may guide the future development of reliable power sources for IoT devices.

The phase transition, multiple valence bands, and resonant bonding endow GeTe with promising thermoelectric performance. Significant breakthroughs are achieved in GeTe&#8208;based materials. This review summarizes the recent progress in developing high&#8208;performance GeTe&#8208;based materials and devices, including the underlying fundamentals, large&#8208;scale production, novel strategies for boosting performance, and techniques of device assembly.








Abstract
Driven by the intensive efforts in the development of high&#8208;performance GeTe thermoelectrics for mass&#8208;market application in power generation and refrigeration, GeTe&#8208;based materials display a high figure of merit of &gt;2.0 and an energy conversion efficiency beyond 10%. However, a comprehensive review on GeTe, from fundamentals to devices, is still needed. In this regard, the latest progress on the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art GeTe is timely reviewed. The phase transition, intrinsic high carrier concentration, and multiple band edges of GeTe are fundamentally analyzed from the perspectives of the native atomic orbital, chemical bonding, and lattice defects. Then, the fabrication methods are summarized with a focus on large&#8208;scale production. Afterward, the strategies for enhancing electronic transports of GeTe by energy filtering effect, resonance doping, band convergence, and Rashba band splitting, and the methods for strengthening phonon scatterings via nanoprecipitates, planar vacancies, and superlattices, are comprehensively reviewed. Besides, the device assembly and performance are highlighted. In the end, future research directions are concluded and proposed, which enlighten the development of broader thermoelectric materials.

         <title>Filler&#8208;Integrated Composite Polymer Electrolyte for Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A critical overview on filler&#8208;integrated composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs) for solid&#8208;state lithium batteries is provided. The categories of fillers and their mechanisms in enhancing ionic conductivity are briefly summarized. Rational design of filler&#8211;polymer interface and filler&#8208;promoted electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface is further elaborated. Challenges and directions are outlined, especially a future vision for developing advanced CPEs for high&#8208;performing SSLBs is proposed.








Abstract
Composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs) utilizing fillers as the promoting component bridge the gap between solid polymer electrolytes and inorganic solid electrolytes. The integration of fillers into the polymer matrices is demonstrated as a prevailing strategy to enhance Li&#8208;ion transport and assist in constructing Li+&#8208;conducting electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface layer, which addresses the two key barriers of solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (SSLBs): low ionic conductivity of electrolyte and high interfacial impedance. Recent review articles have largely focused on the performance of a broad spectrum of CPEs and the general effects of fillers on SSLBs device. Recognizing this, in this review, after briefly presenting the categories of fillers (traditional and emerged) and the promoted ionic conducting mechanisms in CPEs, the progress in the interfacial structure design principle, with the emphasis on the crucial influence of filler size, concentration, and hybridization strategies on filler&#8211;polymer interface that is the most critical to Li&#8208;ion transport is assessed. The latest exciting advances on filler&#8208;enabled in situ generation of a Li+&#8208;conductive layer at the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface to greatly reduce the interfacial impedance are further elaborated. Finally, this review discusses the challenges to be addressed, outlines research directions, and provides a future vision for developing advanced CPEs for high&#8208;performing SSLBs.

         <title>Fully Optical in Operando Investigation of Ambient Condition Electrical Switching in MoS2 Nanodevices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically thin MoS2 electrical switches are characterized for the first time in operando and in ambient conditions through a non&#8208;invasive spectroscopy&#8208;based method. The study sheds light on the &#8211; controversial and still debated &#8211; dynamics driving the switching mechanism. It reveals volatile metallic filaments percolating interatomic spacing in MoS2 and stresses the impact of transfer residues on the electrical performance of switches.








Abstract
MoS2 nanoswitches have shown superb ultralow switching energies without excessive leakage currents. However, the debate about the origin and volatility of electrical switching is unresolved due to the lack of adequate nanoimaging of devices in operando. Here, three optical techniques are combined to perform the first noninvasive in situ characterization of nanosized MoS2 devices. This study reveals volatile threshold resistive switching due to the intercalation of metallic atoms from electrodes directly between Mo and S atoms, without the assistance of sulfur vacancies. A &#8220;semi&#8208;memristive&#8221; effect driven by an organic adlayer adjacent to MoS2 is observed, which suggests that nonvolatility can be achieved by careful interface engineering. These findings provide a crucial understanding of nanoprocess in vertically biased MoS2 nanosheets, which opens new routes to conscious engineering and optimization of 2D electronics.

         <title>Fast and Dynamic Mapping of the Protein Corona on Nanoparticle Surfaces by Photocatalytic Proximity Labeling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein corona broadly affects the delivery of nanomedicines in vivo. Here, a photocatalytic proximity labeling technology in nanoparticles (nano&#8208;PPL) is developed for in situ labeling of corona proteins. Nano&#8208;PPL exhibits a significantly improved temporal resolution (5 s duration) and reveals precise dynamics of protein coronas on anionic and cationic nanoparticles. This technology represents a significant methodological advance toward nano&#8208;protein interactions.








Abstract
Protein corona broadly affects the delivery of nanomedicines in vivo. Although it has been widely studied by multiple strategies like centrifugal sedimentation, the rapidly forming mechanism and the dynamic structure of the protein corona at the seconds level remains challenging. Here, a photocatalytic proximity labeling technology in nanoparticles (nano&#8208;PPL) is developed. By fabricating a &#8220;core&#8208;shell&#8221; nanoparticle co&#8208;loaded with chlorin e6 catalyst and biotin&#8208;phenol probe, nano&#8208;PPL technology is validated for the rapid and precise labeling of corona proteins in situ. Nano&#8208;PPL significantly improves the temporal resolution of nano&#8208;protein interactions to 5 s duration compared with the classical centrifugation method (&gt;30 s duration). Furthermore, nano&#8208;PPL achieves the fast and dynamic mapping of the protein corona on anionic and cationic nanoparticles, respectively. Finally, nano&#8208;PPL is deployed to verify the effect of the rapidly formed protein corona on the initial interaction of nanoparticles with cells. These findings highlight a significant methodological advance toward nano&#8208;protein interactions in the delivery of nanomedicines in vivo.

         <title>Holographically Activatable Nanoprobe via Glutathione/Albumin&#8208;Mediated Exponential Signal Amplification for High&#8208;Contrast Tumor Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A holographically activatable nanoprobe caging manganese tetraoxide is reported for tumor&#8208;selective contrast enhancement in magnetic resonance imaging, which is accomplished through both glutathione/albumin&#8208;mediated cascade signal amplification in tumors and rapid elimination in normal tissues.








Abstract
Glutathione (GSH)&#8208;activatable probes hold great promise for in vivo cancer imaging, but are restricted by their dependence on non&#8208;selective intracellular GSH enrichment and uncontrollable background noise. Here, a holographically activatable nanoprobe caging manganese tetraoxide is shown for tumor&#8208;selective contrast enhancement in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) through cooperative GSH/albumin&#8208;mediated cascade signal amplification in tumors and rapid elimination in normal tissues. Once targeting tumors, the endocytosed nanoprobe effectively senses the lysosomal microenvironment to undergo instantaneous decomposition into Mn2+ with threshold GSH concentration of &#8776; 0.12&#160;mm for brightening MRI signals, thus achieving high contrast tumor imaging and flexible monitoring of GSH&#8208;relevant cisplatin resistance during chemotherapy. Upon efficient up&#8208;regulation of extracellular GSH in&#160;tumor via exogenous injection, the relaxivity&#8208;silent interstitial nanoprobe remarkably evolves into Mn2+ that are further captured/retained and re&#8208;activated into ultrahigh&#8208;relaxivity&#8208;capable complex by stromal albumin in the tumor, and simultaneously allows the renal clearance of off&#8208;targeted nanoprobe in the form of Mn2+ via lymphatic vessels for suppressing background noise to distinguish tiny liver metastasis. These findings demonstrate the concept of holographic tumor activation via both tumor GSH/albumin&#8208;mediated cascade signal amplification and simultaneous background suppression for precise tumor malignancy detection, surveillance, and surgical guidance.

         <title>Semi&#8208;Transparent, Chiral Organic Photodiodes with Incident Direction&#8208;Dependent Selectivity for Circularly Polarized Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semi&#8208;transparent organic photodiodes containing chiral non&#8208;fullerene acceptor and achiral polymer donor respond differently to left and right circularly polarized light. The preference switches when changing the direction of the incoming light. Circular selective absorption in combination with selective collection of carriers from a narrow space charge region can account for the change in polarization.








Abstract
Detection of the circular polarization of light is possible using chiral semiconductors, yet the mechanisms remain poorly understood. Semi&#8208;transparent chiral photodiodes allow for a simple experiment to investigate the basis of their selectivity: changing the side from which the diode is illuminated. A reversal of circular selectivity is observed in photocurrent generation when changing the direction of illumination on organic, bulk&#8208;heterojunction cells. The change in selectivity can be explained by a space&#8208;charge limitation on the collection of photocarriers in combination with preferential absorption of one of the circular polarizations of near&#8208;infrared light by the chiral non&#8208;fullerene acceptor. The space&#8208;charge limitation is supported by detailed measurements of frequency and intensity dependence of dc and ac photocurrents.

         <title>Multifunctional 3D&#8208;Printed Pollen Grain&#8208;Inspired Hydrogel Microrobots for On&#8208;Demand Anchoring and Cargo Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional hydrogel microrobot is created by different stimuli&#8208;responsive hydrogels with pollen grain&#8208;inspired microstructures. The robot is capable of conducting temperature&#8208;responsive on&#8208;demand surface attachment, magnetic locomotion, and pH&#8208;responsive cargo delivery toward biomedical applications.








Abstract
While a majority of wireless microrobots have shown multi&#8208;responsiveness to implement complex biomedical functions, their functional executions are strongly dependent on the range of stimulus inputs, which curtails their functional diversity. Furthermore, their responsive functions are coupled to each other, which results in the overlap of the task operations. Here, a 3D&#8208;printed multifunctional microrobot inspired by pollen grains with three hydrogel components is demonstrated: iron platinum (FePt) nanoparticle&#8208;embedded pentaerythritol triacrylate (PETA), poly N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide (pNIPAM), and poly N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide acrylic acid (pNIPAM&#8208;AAc) structures. Each of these structures exhibits their respective targeted functions: responding to magnetic fields for torque&#8208;driven surface rolling and steering, exhibiting temperature responsiveness for on&#8208;demand surface attachment (anchoring), and pH&#8208;responsive cargo release. The versatile multifunctional pollen grain&#8208;inspired robots conceptualized here pave the way for various future medical microrobots to improve their projected performance and functional diversity.

         <title>Weakening Li+ De&#8208;solvation Barrier for Cryogenic Li&#8211;S Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antecedent theoretical simulations decipher the correlation between lithium salt concentration and Li+ desolvation barrier in the electrolyte, indicating dilute electrolytes can enhance kinetics of sulfur cathode effectively. This insight endows Li&#8211;S pouch cells with an ultra&#8208;high energy density of 350 Wh kg&#8208;1 at 0 &#176;C, demonstrating great&#160;potential for&#160;cryogenic&#160;Li&#8211;S&#160;batteries.








Abstract
Li&#8211;S batteries hold promise for pushing cell&#8208;level energy densities beyond 300&#160;Wh kg&#8208;1 while operating at low temperatures (LTs, below 0&#160;&#176;C). However, the capacity release of existing Li&#8211;S batteries at LTs is still barely satisfactory, and there is almost no verification of the practicability of Li&#8211;S batteries at LTs in the Ah&#8208;level pouch cell. Here, antecedent molecular dynamics (MDs) combined with density functional theory analysis are used to systematically investigate Li+ solvation structure in conventional Li&#8211;S batteries at LTs, which unprecedentedly reveals the positive correlation between lithium salt concentration and Li+ de&#8208;solvation barrier, indicating dilute electrolytes can enhance the Li+ de&#8208;solvation kinetics and thus improve the capacity performance of cryogenic Li&#8211;S batteries. These insights derived from theoretical simulations invested Li&#8211;S batteries with a 67.34% capacity retention at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C compared to their room temperature performance. In particular, an Ah&#8208;level Li&#8211;S pouch cell using dilute electrolytes with a high sulfur loading (5.6&#160;mg cm&#8208;2) and lean electrolyte condition is fabricated, which delivers a discharge capacity of about 1000 mAh g&#8208;1 and ultra&#8208;high energy density of 350&#160;Wh kg&#8208;1 at 0&#160;&#176;C, offering a promising route toward a practical high&#8208;energy cryogenic Li&#8211;S battery.

         <title>Stem Cell Membrane&#8208;Coated Microribbon Scaffolds Induce Regenerative Innate and Adaptive Immune Responses in a Critical&#8208;Size Cranial Bone Defect Model</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cell membrane coating represents a biomimetic strategy for modifying the surface of biomaterials. Coating macroporous microribbon scaffolds with mesenchymal stem cell membrane (MSCM) enhances cranial bone healing via immunomodulation. Primed MSCM&#8208;coating contains ligands that promote M&#966; polarization toward M2, induce Treg differentiation and TCD8+ apoptosis, and enhance MSC osteogenesis. MSCM coating synergizes with BMP&#8208;2 to further accelerate bone regeneration while suppressing inflammation.








Abstract
Naturally&#8208;derived cell membranes have shown great promise in functionalizing nanoparticles to enhance biointerfacing functions for drug delivery applications. However, its potential for functionalizing macroporous scaffolds to enhance tissue regeneration in vivo remains unexplored. Engineering scaffolds with immunomodulatory functions represents an exciting strategy for tissue regeneration but is largely limited to soft tissues. Critical&#8208;sized bone defects cannot heal on their own, and the role of adaptive immune cells in scaffold&#8208;mediated healing of cranial bone defects remains largely unknown. Here, mensenchymal stem cell membrane (MSCM)&#8208;coated microribbon (&#181;RB) scaffolds for treating critical size cranial bone defects via targeting immunomodulation are reported. Confocal imaging and proteomic analyses are used to confirm successful coating and characterize the compositions of cell membrane coating. It is demonstrated that MSCM coating promotes macrophage (M&#966;) polarization toward regenerative phenotype, induces CD8+ T cell apoptosis, and enhances regulatory T cell differentiation in vitro and in vivo. When combined with a low dosage of BMP&#8208;2, MSCM coating further accelerates bone regeneration and suppresses inflammation. These results establish cell membrane&#8208;coated microribbon scaffolds as a promising strategy for treating critical size bone defects via immunomodulation. The platform may be broadly used with different cell membranes and scaffolds to enhance regeneration of multiple tissue types.

         <title>Pyridinic Nitrogen Sites Dominated Coordinative Engineering of Subnanometric Pd Clusters for Efficient Alkynes&#8217; Semihydrogenation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyridinic nitrogen&#8208;site&#8208;dominated coordinative engineering of subnanometric Pd clusters is proposed for efficient alkynes&#8217; semihydrogenation. The obtained catalyst Pd@PPy&#8208;600 exhibits excellent catalytic activity (99%) and selectivity (96%) for phenylacetylene semihydrogenation due to the abundant pyridinic nitrogen sites and interesting electron effects.








Abstract
Supported metal catalysts have played an important role in optimizing selective semihydrogenation of alkynes for fine chemicals. There into, nitrogen&#8208;doped carbons, as a type of promising support materials, have attracted extensive attentions. However, due to the general phenomenon of random doping for nitrogen species in the support, it is still atremendous challenge to finely identify which nitrogen configuration dominates the catalytic property of alkynes&#8217; semihydrogenation. Herein, it is reported that uniform mesoporous N&#8208;doped carbon spheres derived from mesoporous polypyrrole spheres are used as supports to immobilized subnanometric Pd clusters, which provide a particular platform to research the influence of nitrogen configurations on the alkynes&#8217; semihydrogenation. Comprehensive experimental results and density functional theory calculation indicate that pyridinic nitrogen configuration dominates the catalytic behavior of Pd clusters. The high contents of pyridinic nitrogen sites offer abundant coordination sites, which greatly reduces the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining reaction step and makes Pd clusters own high catalytic activity. The electron effect between pyridinic nitrogen sites and Pd clusters makes the reaction highly selective. Additionally, the good mesostructures also promote the fast transport of substrate. Based on the above, catalyst Pd@PPy&#8208;600 exhibits high catalytic activity (99%) and selectivity (96%) for phenylacetylene (C8H6) semihydrogenation.

         <title>Dual/Triple Template&#8208;Induced Evolved Emulsion for Controllable Construction of Anisotropic Carbon Nanoparticles from Concave to Convex</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual/triple template&#8208;induced evolved emulsion strategy is developed for the precise construction of anisotropic mesoporous carbon nanoparticles. It not only endows the concave structure with adjustable size and meso&#8208;structure but also realizes the innovative transformation from concave to convex in a one&#8208;pot method. Moreover, the well&#8208;designed basin&#8208;concave and mountain&#8208;convex nanoparticles manifest excellent performance for improving drug release rate and enzyme catalytic efficiency.








Abstract
Anisotropic mesoporous carbon (AMC) nanoparticles with asymmetric external morphologies, topological internal structure, and superior performance of carbon species are attracting great attention because of their seductive features differentiating them from symmetric nanoparticles. However, a bewildering challenge but crucial desire remains to endow them with flexibly tunable morphology and pore structure. Herein, a dual/triple&#8208;templating evolved emulsion strategy for tunable fabrication of AMC nanoparticles with distinctive defined structure by interface&#8208;energy&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly is first reported based on a brand&#8208;new mechanism. It describes the possible formation process of the concave&#8208;cavity structure and allows for manipulation of the longitudinal and lateral sizes systematically by adjusting emulsion polarity and sodium oleate dosage, respectively. Interestingly, the internal pore structure can be rearranged into radial channels and the external morphology can realize structural transformation from concave to convex by innovatively introducing the third template n&#8208;hexanol, which is unprecedented at nanoscale. Remarkably, due to the excellent properties of carbon species and unique structural characteristics, AMC nanoparticles not only demonstrate good biocompatibility but also exhibit splendid performance in improving the dissolution and release rates of insoluble drug and enhancing the enzyme catalytic efficiency. Generally, this approach provides new inspiration and insights for expanding exquisite anisotropic nanomaterials for many potential applications.

Generally, this approach provides new inspiration and insights for expanding exquisite anisotropic nanomaterials for many potential applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Progress, Challenges, and Opportunities in Oxide Semiconductor Devices: A Key Building Block for Applications Ranging from Display Backplanes to 3D Integrated Semiconductor Chips</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fundamentals of oxide semiconductors are addressed, including a brief history, the function of the constituents and defects, transport mechanisms, and reliability issues. Furthermore, recent achievements of oxide semiconductor transistors are reviewed, and their potential for monolithic 3D integration are introduced. Finally, remaining questions and future directions of oxide semiconductor devices are discussed for next&#8208;generation electronics.








Abstract
As Si has faced physical limits on further scaling down, novel semiconducting materials such as 2D transition metal dichalcogenides and oxide semiconductors (OSs) have gained tremendous attention to continue the ever&#8208;demanding downscaling represented by Moore's law. Among them, OS is considered to be the most promising alternative material because it has intriguing features such as modest mobility, extremely low off&#8208;current, great uniformity, and low&#8208;temperature processibility with conventional complementary&#8208;metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor&#8208;compatible methods. In practice, OS has successfully replaced hydrogenated amorphous Si in high&#8208;end liquid crystal display devices and has now become a standard backplane electronic for organic light&#8208;emitting diode displays despite the short time since their invention in 2004. For OS to be implemented in next&#8208;generation electronics such as back&#8208;end&#8208;of&#8208;line transistor applications in monolithic 3D integration beyond the display applications, however, there is still much room for further study, such as high mobility, immune short&#8208;channel effects, low electrical contact properties, etc. This study reviews the brief history of OS and recent progress in device applications from a material science and device physics point of view. Simultaneously, remaining challenges and opportunities in OS for use in next&#8208;generation electronics are discussed.

         <title>Acid&#8208;Ionizable Iron Nanoadjuvant Augments STING Activation for Personalized Vaccination Immunotherapy of Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An acid&#8208;ionizable iron nanoadjuvant (PEIM) is developed to potentiate cancer vaccination immunotherapy. PEIM nanoadjuvant is coassembled from acid&#8208;ionizable&#160;copolymers with iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) and a stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonist. PEIM nanoadjuvant effectively delivers tumor antigens to lymph nodes, amplifies STING activation and type&#8208;I interferon (IFN&#8208;I) production, and ultimately&#160;elicits antigen&#8208;specific T&#8208;cell response to inhibit tumor growth.








Abstract
The critical challenge for cancer vaccine&#8208;induced T&#8208;cell immunity is the sustained activation of antigen cross&#8208;presentation in antigen&#8208;presenting cells (APCs) with innate immune stimulation. In this study, it is first discovered that the clinically used magnetic contrast agents, iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs), markedly augment the type&#8208;I interferon (IFN&#8208;I) production profile of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonist MSA&#8208;2 and achieve a 16&#8208;fold dosage&#8208;sparing effect in the human STING haplotype. Acid&#8208;ionizable copolymers are coassembled with IONPs and MSA&#8208;2 into iron nanoadjuvants to concentrate STING activation in the draining lymph nodes. The top candidate iron nanoadjuvant (PEIM) efficiently delivers the model antigen ovalbumin (OVA) to CD169+ APCs and facilitates antigen cross&#8208;presentation to elicit a 55&#8208;fold greater frequency of antigen&#8208;specific CD8+ cytotoxic T&#8208;lymphocyte response than soluble antigen. PEIM@OVA nanovaccine immunization induces potent and durable antitumor immunity to prevent tumor lung metastasis and eliminate established tumors. Moreover, PEIM nanoadjuvant is applicable to deliver autologous tumor antigen and synergizes with immune checkpoint blockade therapy for prevention of postoperative tumor recurrence and distant metastasis in B16&#8208;OVA melanoma and MC38 colorectal tumor models. The acid&#8208;ionizable iron nanoadjuvant offers a generalizable and readily translatable strategy to augment STING cascade activation and antigen cross&#8208;presentation for personalized cancer vaccination immunotherapy.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Powered Dielectrophoretic Microparticle Manipulation Platform Based on a Triboelectric Nanogenerator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;powered DEP microparticle manipulation platform based on a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is proposed, which performs high&#8208;efficiency cell separation. This work provides an ideal scheme for improving the portability of microfluidic chips and is beneficial to the commercialization of lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip systems.








Abstract
Lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip systems aim to integrate laboratory operations on a miniaturized device with broad application prospects in the field of point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing. However, bulky peripheral power resources, such as high&#8208;voltage supplies, function generators, and amplifiers, hamper the commercialization of the system. In this work, a portable, self&#8208;powered microparticle manipulation platform based on triboelectrically driven dielectrophoresis (DEP) is reported. A rotary freestanding triboelectric nanogenerator (RF&#8208;TENG) and rectifier/filter circuit supply a high&#8208;voltage direct&#8208;current signal to form a non&#8208;uniform electric field within the microchannel, realizing controllable actuation of the microparticles through DEP. The operating mechanism of this platform and the control performance of the moving particles are systematically studied and analyzed. Randomly distributed particles converge in a row after passing through the serpentine channel and various particles are separated owing to the different DEP forces. Ultimately, the high&#8208;efficiency separation of live and dead yeast cells is achieved using this platform. RF&#8208;TENG as the power source for lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip exhibits better safety and portability than traditional high&#8208;voltage power sources. This study presents a promising solution for the commercialization of lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip.

         <title>&#8220;Enzyme&#8208;Like&#8221; Spatially Fixed Polyhydroxyl Microenvironment&#8208;Activated Hydrochromic Molecular Switching for Naked Eye Detection of ppm Level Humidity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An &#8220;enzyme&#8208;like&#8221; construction strategy for ultralow humidity&#8208;sensitive paper (UHSP) is proposed, which activates hydrochromic molecular switching by constructing a spatially&#8208;fixed polyhydroxyl microenvironment. As a result, recyclable naked eye recognition of 0.01&#8211;100&#160;ppm humidity is achieved first. This UHSP provides a more economical, environmental friendly and convenient choice for ultralow humidity monitoring required by high&#8208;tech manufacturing such as chips, solar cells, etc.








Abstract
The detection and monitoring of ultralow humidity (&lt;100&#160;ppm) are critical in many important industries, such as high&#8208;tech manufacturing, scientific research, and aerospace. However, the development of ppm level humidity sensors with portability, low cost, and ease of regeneration remains a significant challenge. Herein, an innovative &#8220;enzyme&#8208;like&#8221; construction strategy is proposed to address this problem by employing suitable molecular&#8208;level humidity&#8208;sensitive units and chemically constructing a multilevel spatial synergistic sensitization microenvironment around it. The as&#8208;prepared ultralow humidity&#8208;sensitive paper (UHSP) achieved a naked eye recognition humidity of 0.01&#8211;100&#160;ppm. UHSP not only is simple to prepare, handy and low&#8208;cost, but can also be simply and efficiently regenerated as well as recycled many times by skillfully utilizing the &#8220;unconventional sublimation&#8221; and &#8220;lime slaked&#8221; of calcium oxide. The molecular reaction mechanisms involved in the humidity response and regeneration of UHSP have been demonstrated in detail. UHSP can provide a promising new method for ultralow humidity detection in the form of portable kits or sirens. The demonstrated &#8220;enzyme&#8208;like&#8221; construction strategy can bring unlimited ideas and implications to the design and development of sensors with tunable response thresholds, particularly high sensitivity.

As a result, recyclable naked eye recognition of 0.01&#8211;100&#160;ppm humidity is achieved first. This UHSP provides a more economical, environmental friendly and convenient choice for ultralow humidity monitoring required by high-tech manufacturing such as chips, solar cells, etc.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The detection and monitoring of ultralow humidity (&amp;lt;100&#160;ppm) are critical in many important industries, such as high-tech manufacturing, scientific research, and aerospace. However, the development of ppm level humidity sensors with portability, low cost, and ease of regeneration remains a significant challenge. Herein, an innovative &#8220;enzyme-like&#8221; construction strategy is proposed to address this problem by employing suitable molecular-level humidity-sensitive units and chemically constructing a multilevel spatial synergistic sensitization microenvironment around it. The as-prepared ultralow humidity-sensitive paper (UHSP) achieved a naked eye recognition humidity of 0.01&#8211;100&#160;ppm. UHSP not only is simple to prepare, handy and low-cost, but can also be simply and efficiently regenerated as well as recycled many times by skillfully utilizing the &#8220;unconventional sublimation&#8221; and &#8220;lime slaked&#8221; of calcium oxide. The molecular reaction mechanisms involved in the humidity response and regeneration of UHSP have been demonstrated in detail. UHSP can provide a promising new method for ultralow humidity detection in the form of portable kits or sirens. The demonstrated &#8220;enzyme-like&#8221; construction strategy can bring unlimited ideas and implications to the design and development of sensors with tunable response thresholds, particularly high sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Phase&#8208;Change Perovskite Microlaser with Tunable Polarization Vortex</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A subwavelength&#8208;thin perovskite metasurface supporting multiple bound states in the continuum is used to realize a tunable polarization&#8208;vortex laser. The structural phase&#8208;change properties of the perovskite induce bistable dynamic switching of the topological charges as a function of temperature.








Abstract
Metasurfaces supporting optical bound states in the continuum (BICs) are emerging as simple and compact optical cavities to realize polarization&#8208;vortex lasers. The winding of the polarization around the singularity defines topological charges which are generally set by the cavity design and cannot be altered without changing geometrical parameters. Here, a subwavelength&#8208;thin phase&#8208;change halide perovskite BIC metasurface functioning as a tunable polarization vortex microlaser is demonstrated. Upon the perovskite structural phase transitions, both its refractive index and gain vary substantially, inducing reversible and bistable switching between distinct polarization vortexes underpinned by opposite topological charges. Dynamic tuning and switching of the resulting vector beams may find use in microscopy imaging, particle trapping and manipulation, and optical data storage.

         <title>Composition&#8208;Controllable Syntheses and Property Modulations from 2D Ferromagnetic Fe5Se8 to Metallic Fe3Se4 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the composition&#8208;controllable syntheses of 2D non&#8208;layered iron selenide nanosheets (25% Fe&#8208;intercalated triclinic Fe5Se8 and 50% Fe&#8208;intercalated monoclinic Fe3Se4), via a robust chemical vapor deposition strategy is presented. Intriguingly, it has been revealed that the 2D Fe5Se8 exhibits intrinsic room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetic property, and the ultrathin Fe3Se4 presents a novel metallic feature.








Abstract
Exploring new&#8208;type 2D magnetic materials with high magnetic transition temperature and robust air stability has attracted wide attention for developing innovative spintronic devices. Recently, intercalation of native metal atoms into the van der Waals gaps of 2D layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) has been developed to form 2D non&#8208;layered magnetic TMDs, while only succeeded in limited systems (e.g., Cr2S3, Cr5Te8). Herein, composition&#8208;controllable syntheses of 2D non&#8208;layered iron selenide nanosheets (25% Fe&#8208;intercalated triclinic Fe5Se8 and 50% Fe&#8208;intercalated monoclinic Fe3Se4) are firstly reported, via a robust chemical vapor deposition strategy. Specifically, the 2D Fe5Se8 exhibits intrinsic room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetic property, which is explained by the change of electron spin states from layered 1T'&#8208;FeSe2 to non&#8208;layered Fe&#8208;intercalated Fe5Se8 based on density functional theory calculations. In contrast, the ultrathin Fe3Se4 presents novel metallic features comparable with that of metallic TMDs. This work hereby sheds light on the composition&#8208;controllable synthesis and fundamental property exploration of 2D self&#8208;intercalation induced novel TMDs compounds, by propelling their application explorations in nanoelectronics and spintronics&#8208;related fields.

         <title>An Effective Sneak&#8208;Path Solution Based on a Transient&#8208;Relaxation Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy in which&#160;the transient relaxation in a type of dynamic selector made from unipolar volatile memristors is harnessed to effectively address&#160;the sneak&#8208;path problem in memristor arrays is demonstrated.








Abstract
An efficient strategy for addressing individual devices is required to unveil the full potential of memristors for high&#8208;density memory and computing applications. Existing strategies using two&#8208;terminal selectors that are preferable for compact integration have trade&#8208;offs in reduced generality or functional window. A strategy that applies to broad memristors and maintains their full&#8208;range functional window is proposed. This strategy uses a type of unipolar switch featuring a transient relaxation or retention as the selector. The unidirectional current flow in the switch suppresses the sneak&#8208;path current, whereas the transient&#8208;relaxation window is exploited for bidirectional programming. A unipolar volatile memristor with ultralow switching voltage (e.g., &lt;100&#160;mV), constructed from a protein nanowire dielectric harvested from Geobacter sulfurreducens, is specifically employed as the example switch to highlight the advantages and scalability in the strategy for array integration.

         <title>Modulating Hydrogen Adsorption via Charge Transfer at the Semiconductor&#8211;Metal Heterointerface&#160;for Highly Efficient Hydrogen Evolution Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The RhP2/Rh heterointerface induces electron transfer from metallic Rh to semiconductive RhP2, which effectively increases the electron density on the Rh atoms in RhP2 and weakens the hydrogen adsorption on RhP2. The interfacial electron transfer can activate the dual&#8208;site synergistic effect of Rh and P of RhP2, effectively promoting reorganization of interfacial water molecules for faster hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) kinetics.








Abstract
Designing and synthesizing highly efficient and stable electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is important for realizing the hydrogen economy. Tuning the electronic structure of the electrocatalysts is essential to achieve optimal HER activity, and interfacial engineering is an effective strategy to induce electron transfer in a heterostructure interface to optimize HER kinetics. In this study, ultrafine RhP2/Rh nanoparticles are synthesized with a well&#8208;defined semiconductor&#8211;metal heterointerface embedded in N,P co&#8208;doped graphene (RhP2/Rh@NPG) via a one&#8208;step pyrolysis. RhP2/Rh@NPG exhibits outstanding HER performances under all pH conditions. Electrochemical characterization and first principles density functional theory calculations reveal that the RhP2/Rh heterointerface induces electron transfer from metallic Rh to semiconductive RhP2, which increases the electron density on the Rh atoms in RhP2 and weakens the hydrogen adsorption on RhP2, thereby accelerating the HER kinetics. Moreover, the interfacial electron transfer activates the dual&#8208;site synergistic effect of Rh and P of RhP2 in neutral and alkaline environments, thereby promoting reorganization of interfacial water molecules for faster HER kinetics.

         <title>Hybrid Block Copolymer/Perovskite Heterointerfaces for Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid block copolymer/perovskite heterointerfaces strategy is developed for the first time by introducing a novel and functional block copolymer PBDB&#8208;T&#8208;b&#8208;PTY6, and consequently, such an architecture enhances light harvesting, promotes charge transfer and prevents moisture invasion, delivering a champion efficiency over 24% together with enhanced stability.








Abstract
Solution processable semiconductors like organics and emerging lead halide perovskites (LHPs) are ideal candidates for photovoltaics combining high performance and flexibility with reduced manufacturing cost. Moreover, the study of hybrid semiconductors would lead to advanced structures and deep understanding that will propel this field even further. Herein, a novel device architecture involving block copolymer/perovskite hybrid bulk heterointerfaces is investigated, such a modification could enhance light absorption, create an energy level cascade, and provides a thin hydrophobic layer, thus enabling enhanced carrier generation, promoting energy transfer and preventing moisture invasion, respectively. The resulting hybrid block copolymer/perovskite solar cell exhibits a champion efficiency of 24.07% for 0.0725&#160;cm2&#8208;sized devices and 21.44% for 1&#160;cm2&#8208;sized devices, respectively, together with enhanced stability, which is among the highest reports of organic/perovskite hybrid devices. More importantly, this approach has been effectively extended to other LHPs with different chemical compositions like MAPbI3 and CsPbI3, which may shed light on the design of highly efficient block copolymer/perovskite hybrid materials and architectures that would overcome current limitations for realistic application exploration.

         <title>Engineering Metal&#8211;Phenolic Networks for Solar Desalination with Directional Salt Crystallization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8722;phenolic network (MPN)&#8208;engineered 3D evaporators are constructed by alternately arranging superhydrophilic and superhydrophobic sponges secured with hydrophilic threads. The MPN coatings endow the sponges with photothermal properties and selective wettability, enabling the efficient, long&#8208;term, and sustained desalination of high&#8208;salinity brine for both indoor and outdoor field operations.








Abstract
Solar desalination is one of the most promising strategies to address the global freshwater shortage crisis. However, the residual salt accumulated on the top surface of solar evaporators severely reduces light absorption and steam evaporation efficiency, thus impeding the further industrialization of this technology. Herein, a metal&#8211;phenolic network (MPN)&#8208;engineered 3D evaporator composed of photothermal superhydrophilic/superhydrophobic sponges and side&#8208;twining hydrophilic threads for efficient desalination with directional salt crystallization and zero liquid discharge is reported. The MPN coatings afford the engineering of alternating photothermal superhydrophilic/superhydrophobic sponges with high heating efficiency and defined vapor escape channels, while the side&#8208;twining threads induce site&#8208;selective salt crystallization. The 3D evaporator exhibits a high and stable indoor desalination rate (&#8776;2.3&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1) of concentrated seawater (20&#160;wt%) under simulated sun irradiation for over 21 days without the need for salt crystallization inhibitors. This direct desalination is also achieved in outdoor field operations with a production rate of clean water up to &#8776;1.82&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1 from concentrated seawater (10&#160;wt%). Together with the high affinity and multiple functions of MPNs, this work is expected to facilitate the rational design of solar desalination devices and boost the research translation of MPN materials in broader applications.

         <title>Role of Bicontinuous Structure in Elastomeric Electrolytes for High&#8208;Energy Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>

The structure&#8211;property&#8211;electrochemical performance relationship of the elastomeric electrolyte system is established to demonstrate the importance of balancing Li&#8208;ion transport and mechanical properties for achieving high energy Li metal batteries.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium (Li)&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) are garnering attention as a next&#8208;generation battery technology that can surpass conventional Li&#8208;ion batteries in terms of energy density and operational safety under the condition that the issue of uncontrolled Li dendrite is resolved. In this study, various plastic crystal&#8208;embedded elastomer electrolytes (PCEEs) are investigated with different phase&#8208;separated structures, prepared by systematically adjusting the volume ratio of the phases, to elucidate the structure&#8208;property&#8208;electrochemical performance relationship of the PCEE in the LMBs. At an optimal volume ratio of elastomer phase to plastic&#8208;crystal phase (i.e., 1:1), bicontinuous&#8208;structured PCEE, consisting of efficient ion&#8208;conducting, plastic&#8208;crystal pathways with long&#8208;range connectivity within a crosslinked elastomer matrix, exhibits exceptionally high ionic conductivity (&#8776;10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1) at 20 &#176;C and excellent mechanical resilience (elongation at break &#8776; 300%). A full cell featuring this optimized PCEE, a 35&#160;&#181;m thick Li anode, and a high loading LiNi0.83Mn0.06Co0.11O2 (NMC&#8208;83) cathode delivers a high energy density of 437&#160;Wh kganode+cathode+electrolyte&#8722;1. The established structure&#8211;property&#8211;electrochemical performance relationship of the PCEE for solid&#8208;state LMBs is expected to inform the development of the elastomeric electrolytes for various electrochemical energy systems.

         <title>Porous Covalent Organic Polymer Coordinated Single Co Site Nanofibers for Efficient Oxygen&#8208;Reduction Cathodes in Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A liquid processable COP&#8208;based material is directly used in fuel cell devices via a pyrolysis&#8208;free strategy. The nanofibers can be facilely organized into a free&#8208;standing large&#8208;area film with a hierarchical porous texture and the full dispersion of the atomic Co active sites. Resultingly, both the power density and durability are significantly improved compared with the traditional conventional spraying methods.








Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;coordinated single&#8208;cobalt&#8208;atom electrocatalysts, particularly ones derived from high&#8208;temperature pyrolysis of cobalt&#8208;based zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), have emerged as a new frontier in the design of oxygen reduction cathodes in polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs) due to their enhanced durability and smaller Fenton effects related to the degradation of membranes and ionomers compared with emphasized iron&#8208;based electrocatalysts. However, pyrolysis techniques lead to obscure active&#8208;site configurations, undesirably defined porosity and morphology, and fewer exposed active sites. Herein, a highly stable cross&#8208;linked nanofiber electrode is directly prepared by electrospinning using a liquid processability cobalt&#8208;based covalent organic polymer (Co&#8208;COP) obtained via pyrolysis&#8208;free strategy. The resultant fibers can be facilely organized into a free&#8208;standing large&#8208;area film with a uniform hierarchical porous texture and a full dispersion of atomic Co active sites on the catalyst surface. Focused ion beam&#8208;field emission scanning electron microscopy and computational fluid dynamics experiments confirm that the relative diffusion coefficient is enhanced by 3.5 times, which can provide an efficient route both for reactants to enter the active sites, and drain away the produced water efficiently. Resultingly, the peak power density of the integrated Co&#8208;COP nanofiber electrode is remarkably enhanced by 1.72 times along with significantly higher durability compared with conventional spraying methods. Notably, this nanofabrication technique also maintains excellent scalability and uniformity.

Direct observation of the nanoscale polymer network of hydrogels is essential in understanding its properties. Herein, for the first time, a novel staining and structure fixation method is developed for transmission electron microscopy&#160;observation to visualize the hydrogel network architecture in its unperturbed conformation. The revealed molecular structures provide important insights for the friction, adhesion, and fracture of hydrogels.








Abstract
In this work, the authors succeed in direct visualization of the network structure of synthetic hydrogels with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) by developing a novel staining and network fixation method. Such a direct visualization is not carried out because sample preparation and obtaining sufficient contrast are challenging for these soft materials. TEM images reveal robust heterogeneous network architectures at mesh size scale and defects at micro&#8208;scale. TEM images also reveal the presence of abundant dangling chains on the surface of the hydrogel network. The real space structural information provides a comprehensive perspective that links bulk properties with a nanoscale network structure, including fracture, adhesion, sliding friction, and lubrication. The presented method has the potential to advance the field.

         <title>Emergent, Non&#8208;Aging, Extendable, and Rechargeable Exchange Bias in 2D Fe3GeTe2 Homostructures Induced by Moderate Pressuring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon moderate pressuring, Fe3GeTe2 as a prototypical layered magnet transits into a ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic coexisting state, and the homostructure with an atomically smooth interface exhibits unprecedented exchange bias (ExB) without gradual aging before collapsing via avalanching. The very existence of the non&#8208;aging nature further allows achieving, striking and technologically significant extendability and rechargeability of the ExB.








Abstract
As a crucial concept in magnetism and spintronics, exchange bias (ExB) measures the asymmetry in the hysteresis loop of a pinned ferromagnet (FM)/antiferromagnet (AFM) interface. Previous studies are mainly focused on FM/AFM heterostructures composed of conventional bulk materials, whose complex interfaces prohibit precise control and full understanding of the phenomenon. Here, the enabling power of 2D magnets is exploited to demonstrate the emergence, non&#8208;aging, extendability, and rechargeability of ExB in van der Waals Fe3GeTe2 homostructures, upon moderate pressuring. The emergence of the ExB is attributed to a local stress&#8208;induced FM&#8208;to&#8208;AFM transition, as validated using first&#8208;principles calculations, and confirmed in magneto&#8208;optical Kerr effect and second harmonic generation measurements. It is also observed that, negligible ExB aging before the training effect suddenly takes place through avalanching, pronounced delay of the avalanche via timed pressure repetition (extendability), ExB recovery in the post&#8208;training sample upon refreshed pressuring (rechargeability), and demonstrate its versatile tunability. These striking findings offer unprecedented insights into the underlying principles of ExB and its training, with immense technological applications in sight.

         <title>Polarization&#8208;Tunable Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Metatransistor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monolithic integration of a dielectric metasurface into a perovskite light&#8208;emitting transistor is demonstrated. The &#8220;metatransistor&#8221; shows an 8&#8208;fold enhancement of the electroluminescence compared to the unpatterned device. The combination of pixelated metasurfaces in the active area and electrically switchable recombination zone enables dynamic tunability of the electroluminescence polarization.








Abstract
Emerging immersive visual communication technologies require light sources with complex functionality for dynamic control of polarization, directivity, wavefront, spectrum, and intensity of light. Currently, this is mostly achieved by free space bulk optic elements, limiting the adoption of these technologies. Flat optics based on artificially structured metasurfaces that operate at the sub&#8208;wavelength scale are a viable solution, however, their integration into electrically driven devices remains challenging. Here, a radically new approach to monolithic integration of a dielectric metasurface into a perovskite light&#8208;emitting transistor is demonstrated. It is shown that nanogratings directly structured on top of the transistor channel yield an 8&#8208;fold increase of electroluminescence intensity and dynamic tunability of polarization. This new light&#8208;emitting metatransistor device concept opens unlimited opportunities for light management strategies based on metasurface design and integration.

         <title>Merging the Interfaces of Different Shape&#8208;Shifting Polymers Using Hybrid Exchange Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid exchange reactions (among ester, urethane, thiourethane, boronic&#8211;ester, and oxime&#8211;ester linkages) enable stable seamless bonding of covalently cross&#8208;linked networks made by different chemistry, as well as to produce new materials by cross&#8208;fusion. Distinctive multimaterial 3D shape&#8208;shifting structures are demonstrated since this strategy facilitates flexible design in morphology and integration of diverse properties in a monolithic recyclable and potentially healable system.








Abstract
Sophisticated shape&#8208;shifting structures and integration of advanced functions often call for different&#8208;chemistry&#8208;based polymers (such as epoxy and polyurethane) in a unified system. However, permanent cross&#8208;links pose crucial obstacles to be seamless. Here, merging interfaces via hybrid exchange reactions among different dynamic covalent bonds (including ester, urethane, thiourethane, boronic&#8211;ester, and oxime&#8211;ester linkages) is proposed, breaking the long&#8208;lasting restriction that these widely used bonds only undergo self&#8208;exchange reactions. Model compound studies are conducted to verify that hybrid exchange reactions occur. As demonstrations, different liquid crystal elastomers are tenaciously joined into coherent assemblies, with the desired biomimetic structures (e.g., flying fish containing stiff and flexible parts) and rare deformation modes (e.g., flower blooming upon both heating and cooling). Besides connecting polymers, hybrid exchange reactions also facilitate the creation of new materials through cross&#8208;fusion of different polymers. In addition to the polymers used in this work, hybrid exchange reactions can be adapted to other polymers based on similar mechanisms and beyond. Besides shape&#8208;shifting&#8208;related areas (e.g., soft robots, flexible electronics, and biomedical devices), it may also foster innovation in other fields involving general polymers, as well as promote deeper understanding of dynamic covalent chemistry.

         <title>When Chirophotonic Film Meets Wrinkles: Viewing Angle Independent Corrugated Photonic Crystal Paper</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
1D stripe and 2D wavy wrinkled photonic crystal paper are fabricated by shear coating on the wrinkled interpenetrating network rubber substrate to reflect the same color regardless of viewing angle. The wrinkled photonic crystal paper can be applied as an anti&#8208;counterfeiting film and wide&#8208;angle monochromatic light reflector.








Abstract
Light manipulation strategies of nature have fascinated humans for centuries. In particular, structural colors are of considerable interest due to their ability to control the interaction between light and matter. Here, wrinkled photonic crystal papers (PCPs) are fabricated to demonstrate the consistent reflection of colors regardless of viewing angles. The nanoscale molecular self&#8208;assembly of a cholesteric liquid crystal (CLC) with a microscale corrugated surface is combined. Fully polymerizable CLC paints are uniaxially coated onto a wrinkled interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) substrate. Photopolymerization of the helicoidal nanostructures results in a flexible and free&#8208;standing PCP. The facile method of fabricating the wrinkled PCPs provides a scalable route for the development of novel chirophotonic materials with precisely controlled helical pitch and curvature dimensions. The reflection notch position of the flat PCP shifts to a lower wavelength when the viewing angle increased, while the selective reflection wavelength of wrinkled PCP is remained consistent regardless of viewing angles. The optical reflection of the 1D stripe&#8208;wrinkled PCP is dependent on the wrinkle direction. PCPs with different corrugated directions can be patterned to reduce the angular&#8208;dependent optical reflection of wrinkles. Furthermore, 2D wavy&#8208;wrinkled PCP is successfully developed that exhibit directionally independent reflection of color.

         <title>Regulation of Polymer Configurations Enables Green Solvent&#8208;Processed Large&#8208;Area Binary All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells With Breakthrough Performance and High Efficiency Stretchability Factor</title>

         <dc:description>
Regulation of the configurations of the non&#8208;conjugated polymer acceptors enables green solvent&#8208;processed large&#8208;area binary all&#8208;polymer solar cells to achieve record efficiency and robustness. This study not only provides a series of reliable novel conductive materials with excellent performance for flexible wearable solar cells but also elucidates a concept to evaluate the comprehensive performance of organic solar cells.








Abstract
With the great potential of the all&#8208;polymer solar cells for large&#8208;area wearable devices, both large&#8208;area device efficiency and mechanical flexibility are very critical but attract limited attention. In this work, from the perspective of the polymer configurations, two types of terpolymer acceptors PYTX&#8208;A and PYTX&#8208;B (X&#160;= Cl or H) are developed. The configuration difference caused by the replacement of non&#8208;conjugated units results in distinct photovoltaic performance and mechanical flexibility. Benefiting from a good match between the intrinsically slow film&#8208;forming of the active materials and the technically slow film&#8208;forming of the blade&#8208;coating process, the toluene&#8208;processed large&#8208;area (1.21 cm2) binary device achieves a record efficiency of 14.70%. More importantly, a new parameter of efficiency stretchability factor (ESF) is proposed for the first time to comprehensively evaluate the overall device performance. PM6:PYTCl&#8208;A and PM6:PYTCl&#8208;B yield significantly higher ESF than PM6:PY&#8208;IT. Further blending with non&#8208;conjugated polymer donor PM6&#8208;A, the best ESF of 3.12% is achieved for PM6&#8208;A:PYTCl&#8208;A, which is among the highest comprehensive performances.

         <title>Colloidal Quantum Dot Infrared Lasers Featuring Sub&#8208;Single&#8208;Exciton Threshold and Very High Gain</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heavily doped PbS/PbSSe core/alloyed&#8208;shell colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) lead to short&#8208;wave infrared lasers with sub&#8208;single&#8208;exciton pump threshold. These CQDs exhibit strong suppression of Auger recombination thanks to their compositional grading at the core/shell interface. Besides, they offer record high modal gain coefficient as well as long optical gain lifetime.








Abstract
The use of colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) as a gain medium in infrared laser devices has been underpinned by the need for high pumping intensities, very short gain lifetimes, and low gain coefficients. Here, PbS/PbSSe core/alloyed&#8208;shell CQDs are employed as an infrared gain medium that results in highly suppressed Auger recombination with a lifetime of 485&#160;ps, lowering the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) threshold down to 300&#160;&#181;J&#160;cm&#8722;2, and showing a record high net modal gain coefficient of 2180&#160;cm&#8722;1. By doping these engineered core/shell CQDs up to nearly filling the first excited state, a significant reduction of optical gain threshold is demonstrated, measured by transient absorption, to an average&#8208;exciton population&#8208;per&#8208;dot &#12296;Nth&#12297;g of 0.45&#160;due to bleaching of the ground state absorption. This in turn have led to a fivefold reduction in ASE threshold at &#12296;Nth&#12297;ASE&#160;=&#160;0.70&#160;excitons&#8208;per&#8208;dot, associated with a gain lifetime of 280&#160;ps. Finally, these heterostructured QDs are used to achieve near&#8208;infrared lasing at 1670&#160;nm at a pump fluences corresponding to sub&#8208;single&#8208;exciton&#8208;per&#8208;dot threshold (&#12296;Nth&#12297;Las&#160;=&#160;0.87). This work brings infrared CQD lasing thresholds on par to their visible counterparts, and paves the way toward solution&#8208;processed infrared laser diodes.

         <title>Tissue&#8208;Mimetic Supramolecular Polymer Networks for Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integration of non&#8208;covalent cross&#8208;links and conducting polymers enables access to an electrically conductive supramolecular polymer network (E&#8208;SPN) exhibiting tissue&#8208;mimetic softness and stretchablity. The resultant material allows for fabrication of intrinsically&#8208;stretchable, stand&#8208;alone bioelectrodes, capable of comfortably and accurately measuring electromyography signals in real time. This research will offer a step toward the design and construction of next&#8208;generation, skin&#8208;like bioelectronics.








Abstract
Addressing the mechanical mismatch between biological tissue and traditional electronic materials remains a major challenge in bioelectronics. While rigidity of such materials limits biocompatibility, supramolecular polymer networks can harmoniously interface with biological tissues as they are soft, wet, and stretchable. Here, an electrically conductive supramolecular polymer network that simultaneously exhibits both electronic and ionic conductivity while maintaining tissue&#8208;mimetic mechanical properties, providing an ideal electronic interface with the human body, is introduced. Rational design of an ultrahigh affinity host&#8211;guest ternary complex led to binding affinities (&gt;1013&#160;M&#8208;2) of over an order of magnitude greater than previous reports. Embedding these complexes as dynamic cross&#8208;links, coupled with in situ synthesis of a conducting polymer, resulted in electrically conductive supramolecular polymer networks with tissue&#8208;mimetic Young's moduli (&lt;5&#160;kPa), high stretchability (&gt;500%), rapid self&#8208;recovery and high water content (&gt;84%). Achieving such properties enabled fabrication of intrinsically&#8208;stretchable stand&#8208;alone bioelectrodes, capable of accurately monitoring electromyography signals, free from any rigid&#160;materials.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Dual&#8208;Site Cathode with a Record High Sulfur Mass Loading for High&#8208;Performance Room&#8208;Temperature Sodium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated dual&#8208;active&#8208;site cathode is developed by wreathing monolayered MoS2 and Mo1 on sulfur&#8208;doped graphene frameworks for high&#8208;performance room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur batteries. The constructed atomic level MoS2&#8208;Mo1 with delocalized electron effects facilitates substantial charge transfer and a completely reversible reaction between S and Na, thus alleviating the shuttle effect.








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur (RT&#8208;Na/S) batteries possess high potential for grid&#8208;scale stationary energy storage due to their low cost and high energy density. However, the issues arising from the low S mass loading and poor cycling stability caused by the shuttle effect of polysulfides seriously limit their operating capacity and cycling capability. Herein, sulfur&#8208;doped graphene frameworks supporting atomically dispersed 2H&#8208;MoS2 and Mo1 (S@MoS2&#8208;Mo1/SGF) with a record high sulfur mass loading of 80.9&#160;wt.% are synthesized as an integrated dual active sites cathode for RT&#8208;Na/S batteries. Impressively, the as&#8208;prepared S@MoS2&#8208;Mo1/SGF display unprecedented cyclic stability with a high initial capacity of 1017&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 and a low&#8208;capacity fading rate of 0.05% per cycle over 1000&#160;cycles. Experimental and computational results including X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, in situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and density&#8208;functional theory calculations reveal that atomic&#8208;level Mo in this integrated dual&#8208;active&#8208;site forms a delocalized electron system, which could improve the reactivity of sulfur and reaction reversibility of S and Na, greatly alleviating the shuttle effect. The findings not only provide an effective strategy to fabricate high&#8208;performance dual&#8208;site cathodes, but also deepen the understanding of their enhancement mechanisms at an atomic level.

         <title>Decoupled Solar Energy Storage and Dark Photocatalysis in a 3D Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A material is showcased that combines light harvesting, photoinduced free&#8208;electron generation, and long&#8208;lived electron storage over several weeks. This phenomenon arises from the geometry&#8208;constraining confinement of a rhenium coordination complex in a metal&#8211;organic framework. Decoupled, on&#8208;demand discharge for dark photocatalysis and light&#8208;driven multicycle recharging is demonstrated, highlighting a candidate material toward solar capacitor and solar battery systems.








Abstract
Materials enabling solar energy conversion and long&#8208;term storage for readily available electrical and chemical energy are key for off&#8208;grid energy distribution. Herein, the specific confinement of a rhenium coordination complex in a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) unlocks a unique electron accumulating property under visible&#8208;light irradiation. About 15&#160;C gMOF&#8722;1 of electric charges can be concentrated and stored for over four weeks without loss. Decoupled, on&#8208;demand discharge for electrochemical reactions and H2 evolution catalysis is shown and light&#8208;driven recharging can be conducted for &gt;10 cycles with &#8776;90% of the initial charging capacity retained. Experimental investigations and theoretical calculations link electron trapping to MOF&#8208;induced geometry constraints as well as the coordination environment of the Re&#8208;center, highlighting the key role of MOF confinement on molecular guests. This study serves as the seminal report on 3D porous colloids achieving photoaccumulation of long&#8208;lived electrons, unlocking dark photocatalysis, and a path toward solar capacitor and solar battery systems.

         <title>Ultrathin Hydrogel Films toward Breathable Skin&#8208;Integrated Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin hydrogel films are fabricated by a facile cold&#8208;lamination method and demonstrated as the skin&#8211;electronics interface. The hydrogels comply with glyphic lines and subtle minutiae on the skin surface, allowing unimpeded transepidermal water loss and breathing of the skin underneath. Multitype organic thin&#8208;film (opto)electronics can attach to the skin interfaced with the ultrathin hydrogel, realizing seamless integration and long&#8208;term applications.








Abstract
On&#8208;skin electronics that offer revolutionary capabilities in personalized diagnosis, therapeutics, and human&#8211;machine interfaces require seamless integration between the skin and electronics. A common question remains whether an ideal interface can be introduced to directly bridge thin&#8208;film electronics with the soft skin, allowing the skin to breathe freely and the skin&#8208;integrated electronics to function stably. Here, an ever&#8208;thinnest hydrogel is reported that is compliant to the glyphic lines and subtle minutiae on the skin without forming air gaps, produced by a facile cold&#8208;lamination method. The hydrogels exhibit high water&#8208;vapor permeability, allowing nearly unimpeded transepidermal water loss and free breathing of the skin underneath. Hydrogel&#8208;interfaced flexible (opto)electronics without causing skin irritation or accelerated device performance deterioration are demonstrated. The long&#8208;term applicability is recorded for over one week. With combined features of extreme mechanical compliance, high permeability, and biocompatibility, the ultrathin hydrogel interface promotes the general applicability of skin&#8208;integrated electronics.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Microdomain Interlocking Polymer Electrolytes for Advanced All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Battery Chemistries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rational concept of high&#8208;entropy microdomain interlocking all&#8208;solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes is designed by introducing newly polymerized multifunctional ABC miktoarm star terpolymers into polyethylene oxide. The tailor&#8208;made electrolyte shows advanced mechanical, electrochemical, and thermodynamic performances, stably enabling all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li metal symmetrical cell cycles over 4000&#160;h.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes (ASPEs) with excellent processivity are considered one of the most forward&#8208;looking materials for large&#8208;scale industrialization. However, the contradiction between improving the mechanical strength and accelerating the ionic migration of ASPEs has always been difficult to reconcile. Herein, a rational concept is raised of high&#8208;entropy microdomain interlocking ASPEs (HEMI&#8208;ASPEs), inspired by entropic elasticity well&#8208;known in polymer and biochemical sciences, by introducing newly designed multifunctional ABC miktoarm star terpolymers into polyethylene oxide for the first time. The tailor&#8208;made HEMI&#8208;ASPEs possess multifunctional polymer chains, which induce themselves to assemble into micro&#8208; and nanoscale dynamic interlocking networks with high topological structure entropy. HEMI&#8208;ASPEs achieve excellent toughness, considerable ionic conductivity, an appreciable lithium transference number (0.63), and desirable thermal stability (Td&#160;&gt; 400&#160;&#176;C) for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries. The Li|HEMI&#8208;ASPE&#8208;Li|Li symmetrical cell shows a stable Li plating/stripping performance over 4000&#160;h, and a LiFePO4|HEMI&#8208;ASPE&#8208;Li|Li full cell exhibits a high capacity retention (&#8776;96%) after 300 cycles. This work contributes an innovative design concept introducing high&#8208;entropy supramolecular dynamic networks for ASPEs.

         <title>Extremely Suppressed Energetic Disorder in a Chemically Doped Conjugated Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is discovered that the energetic disorder inevitably arising in chemically doped conjugated polymers (CPs) can be suppressed close to the theoretical limit. Even after the incorporation of significant amount of dopant, the distribution of states for intramolecular sites is maintained as narrow because of the high planarity of the CP backbone chains, resulting in excellent charge&#8208;transport properties.








Abstract
Chemical doping can be used to tune the optoelectronic properties of conjugated polymers (CPs), extending their applications as conducting materials. Unfortunately, chemically doped CP films containing excess dopants exhibit an increase in energetic disorder upon structural alteration, and Coulomb interactions between charge carriers and dopants also affect such disorder. The increase in energetic disorder leads to a broadening of the density of states, which consequently impedes efficient charge transport in chemically doped CPs. However, the molecular origins that are inherently resistant to such incidental increase of energetic disorder in chemically doped CPs have not been sufficiently explored. Here, it is discovered that energetic disorder in chemically doped CPs can be suppressed to a level close to the theoretical limit. Indacenodithiophene&#8208;co&#8208;benzothiadiazole (IDTBT) doped with triethyloxonium hexachloroantimonate (OA) exhibits disorder&#8208;free charge&#8208;transport characteristics and band&#8208;like transport behavior with astonishing carrier mobility as a result of reinforced 1D intramolecular transport. Molecular structure of IDTBT provides a capability to lower the energetic disorder that generally arises from the inclusion of heterogeneous dopants. The results suggest the possibilities of implementing disorder&#8208;free CPs that exhibit excellent charge transport characteristics in the chemically doped state and satisfy a prerequisite for their availability in the industry.

         <title>Chiral Seeded Growth of Gold Nanorods Into Fourfold Twisted Nanoparticles with Plasmonic Optical Activity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fourfold twisted Au nanorods can be prepared via chiral seeded growth, using cysteine as a chiral inducer. A high dissymmetry factor is obtained and electromagnetic simulations show chiral plasmon modes with largely asymmetric near&#8208;field enhancement. The mechanism involved in chiral growth is related with cysteine&#8208;induced enantioselective development of chiral facets.








Abstract
A robust and reproducible methodology to prepare stable inorganic nanoparticles with chiral morphology may hold the key to the practical utilization of these materials. An optimized chiral growth method to prepare fourfold twisted gold nanorods is described herein, where the amino acid cysteine is used as a dissymmetry inducer. Four tilted ridges are found to develop on the surface of single&#8208;crystal nanorods upon repeated reduction of HAuCl4, in the presence of cysteine as the chiral inducer and ascorbic acid as a reducing agent. From detailed electron microscopy analysis of the crystallographic structures, it is proposed that the dissymmetry results from the development of chiral facets in the form of protrusions (tilted ridges) on the initial nanorods, eventually leading to a twisted shape. The role of cysteine is attributed to assisting enantioselective facet evolution, which is supported by density functional theory simulations of the surface energies, modified upon adsorption of the chiral molecule. The development of R&#8208;type and S&#8208;type chiral structures (small facets, terraces, or kinks) would thus be non&#8208;equal, removing the mirror symmetry of the Au NR and in turn resulting in a markedly chiral morphology with high plasmonic optical activity.

     alt="Chiral Seeded Growth of Gold Nanorods Into Fourfold Twisted Nanoparticles with Plasmonic Optical Activity"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourfold twisted Au nanorods can be prepared via chiral seeded growth, using cysteine as a chiral inducer. A high dissymmetry factor is obtained and electromagnetic simulations show chiral plasmon modes with largely asymmetric near-field enhancement. The mechanism involved in chiral growth is related with cysteine-induced enantioselective development of chiral facets.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A robust and reproducible methodology to prepare stable inorganic nanoparticles with chiral morphology may hold the key to the practical utilization of these materials. An optimized chiral growth method to prepare fourfold twisted gold nanorods is described herein, where the amino acid cysteine is used as a dissymmetry inducer. Four tilted ridges are found to develop on the surface of single-crystal nanorods upon repeated reduction of HAuCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, in the presence of cysteine as the chiral inducer and ascorbic acid as a reducing agent. From detailed electron microscopy analysis of the crystallographic structures, it is proposed that the dissymmetry results from the development of chiral facets in the form of protrusions (tilted ridges) on the initial nanorods, eventually leading to a twisted shape. The role of cysteine is attributed to assisting enantioselective facet evolution, which is supported by density functional theory simulations of the surface energies, modified upon adsorption of the chiral molecule. The development of &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;-type and &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-type chiral structures (small facets, terraces, or kinks) would thus be non-equal, removing the mirror symmetry of the Au NR and in turn resulting in a markedly chiral morphology with high plasmonic optical activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Impact&#8208;Resistant Hydrogels by Harnessing 2D Hierarchical Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioinspired hydrogels with lobster&#8208;underbelly&#8208;like properties are reported. By engineering the hierarchical structures, synthetic hydrogel materials can be enabled with the lobster&#8208;underbelly&#8208;like combinational properties, including high ballistic resistance, toughness, strength, water content, and superior softness.








Abstract
With the strengthening capacity through harnessing multi&#8208;length&#8208;scale structural hierarchy, synthetic hydrogels hold tremendous promise as a low&#8208;cost and abundant material for applications demanding unprecedented mechanical robustness. However, integrating high impact resistance and high water content, yet superior softness, in a single hydrogel material still remains a grand challenge. Here, a simple, yet effective, strategy involving bidirectional freeze&#8208;casting and compression&#8208;annealing is reported, leading to a hierarchically structured hydrogel material. Rational engineering of the distinct 2D&#160;lamellar structures, well&#8208;defined nanocrystalline domains and robust interfacial interaction among the lamellae, synergistically contributes to a record&#8208;high ballistic energy absorption capability (i.e., 2.1 kJ m&#8722;1), without sacrificing their high water content (i.e., 85 wt%) and superior softness. Together with its low&#8208;cost and extraordinary energy dissipation capacity, the hydrogel materials present a durable alternative to conventional hydrogel materials for armor&#8208;like protection&#160;circumstances.

         <title>Ultrastrong, Thermally Stable, and Food&#8208;Safe&#160;Seaweed&#8208;Based Structural Material for Tableware</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A food&#8208;safe sargassum cellulose nanofiber (SCNF) is extracted through an efficient and low energy consuming way. Then, by assembling the SCNF into a dense bulk material, a strong structural material can be prepared. It possesses good machinability, which can be processed into tableware with better overall performance than that of commercial tableware, showing great application potential in the tableware field.








Abstract
Widely used disposable plastic tableware is usually buried or directly discharged into the natural environment after using, which poses potential threats to the natural environment and human health. To solve this problem, nondegradable plastic tableware needs to be replaced by tableware composed of biodegradable structural materials with both food safety and the excellent mechanical and thermal properties. Here, a food&#8208;safe sargassum cellulose nanofiber (SCNF) is extracted from common seaweed in an efficient and low energy consuming way under mild reaction conditions. Then, by assembling the SCNF into a dense bulk material, a strong sargassum cellulose nanofiber structural material (SCNSM) with high strength (283&#160;MPa) and high thermal stability (&gt;160&#160;&#176;C) can be prepared. The SCNSM also possesses good machinability, which can be processed into tableware with different shapes, e.g., knives and forks. The overall performance of the SCNSM&#8208;based tableware is better than commercial plastic, wood&#8208;based, and poly(lactic acid) tableware, which shows great application potential in the tableware field.

         <title>Tolerogenic Nanovaccine for Prevention and Treatment of Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tolerogenic nanovaccine is constructed to deliver a self&#8208;antigen and dexamethasone on an abatacept&#8208;modified polydopamine nanoparticle. In experimental&#8208;autoimmune encephalomyelitis model mice, preimmunization of the nanovaccine completely blocks the development of clinical symptoms. Immunization after the self&#8208;antigen injection ameliorates the symptoms of autoimmune encephalomyelitis. The concept of tolerogenic nanovaccine can be applied to other autoimmune diseases.








Abstract
Herein, a tolerogenic nanovaccine is developed and tested on an animal model of multiple sclerosis. The nanovaccine is constructed to deliver the self&#8208;antigen, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) peptide, and dexamethasone on an abatacept&#8208;modified polydopamine core nanoparticle (AbaLDPN&#8208;MOG). AbaLDPN&#8208;MOG can target dendritic cells and undergo endocytosis followed by trafficking to lysosomes. AbaLDPN&#8208;MOG blocks the interaction between CD80/CD86 and CD28 in antigen&#8208;presenting cells and T cells, leading to decreased interferon gamma secretion. The subcutaneous administration of AbaLDPN&#8208;MOG to mice yields significant biodistribution to lymph nodes and, in experimental&#8208;autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model mice, increases the integrity of the myelin basic sheath and minimizes the infiltration of immune cells. EAE mice are treated with AbaLDPN&#8208;MOG before or after injection of the autoantigen, MOG. Preimmunization of AbaLDPN&#8208;MOG before the injection of MOG completely blocks the development of clinical symptoms. Early treatment with AbaLDPN&#8208;MOG at three days after injection of MOG also completely blocks the development of symptoms. Notably, treatment of EAE symptom&#8208;developed mice with AbaLDPN&#8208;MOG significantly alleviates the symptoms, indicating that the nanovaccine has therapeutic effects. Although AbaLDPN is used for MOG peptide delivery in the EAE model, the concept of AbaLDPN can be widely applied for the prevention and alleviation of other autoimmune diseases.

         <title>Tailoring Poly(Styrene&#8208;co&#8208;maleic anhydride) Networks for All&#8208;Polymer Dielectrics Exhibiting Ultrahigh Energy Density and Charge&#8211;Discharge Efficiency at Elevated Temperatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrahigh discharged energy densities at elevated temperatures are achieved in all&#8208;organic crosslinked polymer dielectrics by tailoring polymer networks at the molecular level. This work provides new insights into the polymer structures that control electrical conduction at high&#8208;temperatures and high&#8208;fields, which will propel the development of scalable capacitive dielectrics for harsh&#8208;environment applications.








Abstract
Polymer film capacitors have been widely used in electronics and electrical power systems due to their advantages of high power densities, fast charge&#8211;discharge speed, and great stability. However, the exponential increase of electrical conduction with temperature and applied electric field substantially degrades the capacitive performance of dielectric polymers at elevated temperatures. Here, the first example of controlling the energy level of charge traps in all&#8208;organic crosslinked polymers by tailoring molecular structures that significantly inhibit high&#8208;field high&#8208;temperature conduction loss, which largely differs from current approaches based on the introduction of inorganic fillers, is reported. The polymer network with optimized crosslinking structures exhibits an ultrahigh discharged energy density of 7.02&#8201;J&#8201;cm&#8722;3 with charge/discharge efficiencies of &gt;90% at 150&#160;&#176;C, far outperforming current dielectric polymers and composites. The charge&#8208;trapping effects in different crosslinked structures, as the origins of the marked improvements in the high&#8208;temperature capacitive performance, are comprehensively investigated experimentally and confirmed computationally. Moreover, excellent cyclability and self&#8208;healing features are demonstrated in the polymer film capacitors. This work offers a promising pathway of molecular structure design to scalable high&#8208;energy&#8208;density polymer dielectrics capable of operating under harsh environments.

         <title>Ultrathin Cellulose Nanofiber Assisted Ambient&#8208;Pressure&#8208;Dried, Ultralight, Mechanically Robust, Multifunctional MXene Aerogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Employing the renewable, ultrathin, large&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio cellulose nanofiber (CNF) as a cross&#8208;linker, the large&#8208;area, ultralight yet robust MXene&#8208;based aerogels with multifunctionality are prepared through the simple, energy&#8208;efficient, and scalable ambient&#8208;pressure&#8208;dried approach. The synergies of the MXene, CNF, and abundant pores efficiently improve the EMI shielding performance, dye adsorption, photothermal conversion, and absorption of viscous crude oil.








Abstract
Ambient&#8208;pressure&#8208;dried (APD) preparation of transition metal carbide/nitrides (MXene) aerogels is highly desirable yet remains highly challenging. Here, ultrathin, high&#8208;strength&#8208;to&#8208;weight&#8208;ratio, renewable cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) are efficiently utilized to assist in the APD preparation of ultralight yet robust, highly conductive, large&#8208;area MXene&#8208;based aerogels via a facile, energy&#8208;efficient, eco&#8208;friendly, and scalable freezing&#8208;exchanging&#8208;drying approach. The strong interactions of large&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio CNF and MXene as well as the biomimetic nacre&#8208;like microstructure induce high mechanical strength and stability to avoid the structure collapse of aerogels in the APD process. Abundant functional groups of CNFs facilitate the chemical crosslinking of MXene&#8208;based aerogels, significantly improving the hydrophobicity, water resistance, and even oxidation stability. The ultrathin, 1D nature of the CNF renders the minimal MXenes&#8217; interlayered gaps and numerous heterogeneous interfaces, yielding the excellent conductivity and electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding performance of aerogels. The synergies of the MXene, CNF, and abundant pores efficiently improve the EMI shielding performance, photothermal conversion, and absorption of viscous crude oil. This work shows great promises of the APD, multifunctional MXene&#8208;based aerogels in electromagnetic protection or compatibility, thermal therapy, and oil&#8208;water separation applications.

         <title>A Hemispherical Image Sensor Array Fabricated with Organic Photomemory Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The authors develop a photolithographic process to prepare a hemispherical image sensor array using one organic thin film photomemory transistor per pixel. Their organic thin&#8208;film photomemory transistors can achieve linear photoresponse, along with the best responsivity for similar dark currents among all the reported hemispherical image sensor arrays to date.








Abstract
Hemispherical image sensors simplify lens designs, reduce optical aberrations, and improve image resolution for compact wide&#8208;field&#8208;of&#8208;view cameras. To achieve hemispherical image sensors, organic materials are promising candidates due to the following advantages: tunability of optoelectronic/spectral response and low&#8208;temperature low&#8208;cost processes. Here, a photolithographic process is developed to prepare a hemispherical image sensor array using organic thin film photomemory transistors with a density of 308 pixels per square centimeter. This design includes only one photomemory transistor as a single active pixel, in contrast to the conventional pixel architecture, consisting of select/readout/reset transistors and a photodiode. The organic photomemory transistor, comprising light&#8208;sensitive organic semiconductor and charge&#8208;trapping dielectric, is able to achieve a linear photoresponse (light intensity range, from 1 to 50&#160;W m&#8722;2), along with a responsivity as high as 1.6 A W&#8722;1 (wavelength = 465&#160;nm) for a dark current of 0.24 A m&#8722;2 (drain voltage =&#160;&#8722;1.5&#160;V). These observed values represent the best responsivity for similar dark currents among all the reported hemispherical image sensor arrays to date. A transfer method was&#160;further developed that does not damage organic materials for hemispherical organic photomemory transistor arrays. These developed techniques are scalable and are amenable for other high&#8208;resolution 3D organic semiconductor devices.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Magnetic Skyrmions and Large Topological Hall Effect in Chromium Telluride Engineered by Self&#8208;Intercalation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic skyrmions and large topological Hall effect are demonstrated in chromium telluride. The Curie temperature and magnetic anisotropy in Cr1+xTe2 can be controlled by the self&#8208;intercalate concentration x. In Cr1.53Te2, which has a Curie temperature of 295&#160;K and a relatively weak perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, room&#8208;temperature skyrmions and topological Hall resistivity as large as &#8776;106&#160;n&#937;&#160;cm are observed.








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature magnetic skyrmion materials exhibiting robust topological Hall effect (THE) are crucial for novel nano&#8208;spintronic devices. However, such skyrmion&#8208;hosting materials are rare in nature. In this study, a self&#8208;intercalated transition metal dichalcogenide Cr1+xTe2 with a layered crystal structure that hosts room&#8208;temperature skyrmions and exhibits large THE is reported. By tuning the self&#8208;intercalate concentration, a monotonic control of Curie temperature from 169 to 333&#160;K and a magnetic anisotropy transition from out&#8208;of&#8208;plane to the in&#8208;plane configuration are achieved. Based on the intercalation engineering, room&#8208;temperature skyrmions are successfully created in Cr1.53Te2 with a Curie temperature of 295&#160;K and a relatively weak perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Remarkably, a skyrmion&#8208;induced topological Hall resistivity as large as &#8776;106&#160;n&#937; cm is observed at 290&#160;K. Moreover, a sign reversal of THE is also found at low temperatures, which can be ascribed to other topological spin textures having an opposite topological charge to that of the skyrmions. Therefore, chromium telluride can be a new paradigm of the skyrmion material family with promising prospects for future device applications.

         <title>Pt Single Atoms on CrN Nanoparticles Deliver Outstanding Activity and CO Tolerance in the Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt single&#8208;atom catalysts with novel and small&#8208;sized CrN nanoparticles as potential support is successfully prepared by atomic layer deposition method and exhibit superior activity and CO&#8208;tolerance toward hydrogen oxidation reaction, which is of great significance for the full utilization of low&#8208;cost H2 with impurity CO in proton exchange membrane fuel cells.








Abstract
The large&#8208;scale application of proton exchange membrane fuel cells is currently hampered by high cost of commercial Pt catalysts and their susceptibility to poisoning by CO impurities in H2 feed. In this context, the development of CO&#8208;tolerant electrocatalysts with high Pt atom utilization efficiency for hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) is of critical importance. Herein, Pt single atoms are successfully immobilized on chromium nitride nanoparticles by atomic layer deposition method, denoted as Pt SACs/CrN. Electrochemical tests establish Pt SACs/CrN to be a very efficient HOR catalyst, with a mass activity that is 5.7 times higher than commercial PtRu/C. Strikingly, the excellent performance of Pt SACs/CrN is maintained after introducing 1000&#160;ppm of CO in H2 feed. The excellent CO&#8208;tolerance of Pt SACs/CrN is related to weaker CO adsorption on Pt single atoms. This work provides guidelines for the design and construction of active and CO&#8208;tolerant catalysts for HOR.

         <title>Molecular&#8208;Crowding Effect Mimicking Cold&#8208;Resistant Plants to Stabilize the Zinc Anode with Wider Service Temperature Range</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular crowding electrolyte is developed for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries. Betaine in the electrolyte can regulate the solvation sheath of Zn2+ and adsorb on the Zn anode to guide the dendrite&#8208;free deposition of Zn2+. A high concentration of betaine breaks the H&#8208;bond between H2O, which keeps the Zn anode stable in a wide temperature range from &#8722;30 to 60 &#176;C.








Abstract
Growth of dendrites, the low plating/stripping efficiency of Zn anodes, and the high freezing point of aqueous electrolytes hinder the practical application of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries. Here, a zwitterionic osmolyte&#8208;based molecular crowding electrolyte is presented, by adding betaine (Bet, a by&#8208;product from beet plant) to the aqueous electrolyte, to solve the abovementioned problems. Substantive verification tests, density functional theory calculations, and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations consistently reveal that side reactions and growth of Zn dendrites are restrained because Bet can break Zn2+ solvation and regulate oriented 2D Zn2+ deposition. The Bet/ZnSO4 electrolyte enables superior reversibility in a Zn&#8211;Cu half&#8208;cell to achieve a high Coulombic efficiency &gt;99.9% for 900 cycles (&#8776;1800 h), and dendrite&#8208;free Zn plating/stripping in Zn&#8211;Zn cells for 4235 h at 0.5 mA cm&#8722;2 and 0.5 mAh cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, a high concentration of Bet lowers the freezing point of the electrolyte to &#8722;92 &#176;C via the molecular&#8208;crowding effect, which ensures the stable operation of the aqueous batteries at &#8722;30 &#176;C. This innovative concept of such a molecular crowding electrolyte will inject new vitality into the development of multifunctional aqueous electrolytes.

         <title>Mesoporous PdN Alloy Nanocubes for Efficient Electrochemical Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mesoporous PdN alloy nanocubes are reported as the highly active and selective electrocatalyst for electrocatalytic reduction of nitrate to recyclable ammonia (NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3). The remarkable performance results from combined synergies of mesoporous structure and PdN alloy, which facilitate the adsorption and reactivity of NO3&#8722; and enhance the retention time of electrocatalyzing NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 through an eight&#8208;electron transfer pathway.








Abstract
Developing highly active and selective electrocatalysts for electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NITRR) is very important for synthesizing recyclable ammonia (NH3) in an economic and environmentally friendly manner. Despite some encouraging progress, their activity and selectivity have been remarkably slower than expected. In this manuscript, mesoporous palladium&#8208;nonmetal (meso&#8208;PdX) nanocubes (NCs) are reported as a new series of highly efficient electrocatalysts for selective nitrate reduction reaction (NITRR) electrocatalysis to NH3. The samples feature uniformly alloyed compositions and highly penetrated mesopores with abundant highly active sites and optimized electronic structures. The best meso&#8208;PdN NCs hold an outstanding NITRR activity and selectivity with a remarkable NH3 Faradaic efficiency of 96.1% and a yield rate of 3760&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 mg&#8722;1, suppressing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts. Meanwhile, meso&#8208;PdN NCs are electrocatalytically stable, retaining well the activity and selectivity of NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 electrocatalysis for more than 20 cycles. Detailed mechanism studies ascribe the superior performance to combined compositional and structural synergies of meso&#8208;PdN NCs that not only promote the adsorption (reactivity) of NO3&#8722; and the desorption of NH3 but also increase the retention time of key intermediates for the deeper NITRR electrocatalysis to NH3 through an eight&#8208;electron pathway.

         <title>Bifacial Dye Membranes: Ultrathin and Free&#8208;Standing although not Being Covalently Bound</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of template layers for extension of Langmuir&#8208;Blodgett and related techniques to utilize water&#8208;soluble dyes for the synthesis of quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional molecular layers at the water&#8208;air interface is . Bilayers and intercalated layers stable enough to span 25 &#181;m &#215; 25 &#181;m meshes, although not covalently bonded, are demonstrated. Scalable fabrication of these broadly absorbing pi&#8208;conjugated films is realized via a modified roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll process.








Abstract
Layers of aligned dyes are key to photo&#8208;driven charge separation in dye sensitized solar cells, but cannot be exploited as rectifying membranes in photocatalysis to separate half&#8208;cells because they are not sufficiently stable. While impressive work on the fabrication of stable noncovalent membranes has been recently demonstrated, these membranes are inherently suffering from non&#8208;uniform orientation of the constituting dyes. To stabilize layers made from uniformly assembled and aligned dyes, they can be covalently cross&#8208;linked via functional groups or via chromophores at the expense of their optical properties. Here stable membranes from established dyes are reported that do not need to be elaborately functionalized nor do their chromophores need to be destroyed. These membranes are free&#8208;standing, although being only non&#8208;covalently linked. To enable uniform dye&#8208;alignment, Langmuir layers made from linear, water&#8208;insoluble dyes are used. That water&#8208;soluble charge transfer dyes adsorb onto and intercalate into the Langmuir layer from the aqueous subphase, thus yielding free&#8208;standing, molecularly thin membranes are demonstrated. The developed bifacial layers consist almost entirely of &#960;&#8208;conjugated units and thus can conduct charges and can be further engineered for optoelectronic and photocatalytic applications.

         <title>Chiral Seeded Growth of Gold Nanorods Into Fourfold Twisted Nanoparticles with Plasmonic Optical Activity (Adv. Mater. 1/2023)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>

Chiral Nanoparticles
In article number 2208299, Bing Ni, Sara Bals, Luis M. Liz&#8208;Marz&#225;n, and co&#8208;workers show how plasmonic optical activity in chiral nanoparticles can be tuned and optimized through the chiral morphological details. Twisted gold nanorods evolve through removal of mirror symmetry during dissymmetric seeded growth. Both experimental and theoretical analysis indicates that the underlying mechanism relates to cysteine&#8208;induced enantioselective development of chiral facets. The resulting 4&#8208;fold twisted structure leads to high dissymmetry factors.

&lt;p&gt;In article number &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202208299"&gt;2208299&lt;/a&gt;, Bing Ni, Sara Bals, Luis M. Liz-Marz&#225;n, and co-workers show how plasmonic optical activity in chiral nanoparticles can be tuned and optimized through the chiral morphological details. Twisted gold nanorods evolve through removal of mirror symmetry during dissymmetric seeded growth. Both experimental and theoretical analysis indicates that the underlying mechanism relates to cysteine-induced enantioselective development of chiral facets. The resulting 4-fold twisted structure leads to high dissymmetry factors.

Light&#8208;Emitting Metatransistors
A radically new light&#8208;emitting device concept, the perovskite light&#8208;emitting metatransistor, which enables active tunability of electroluminescence intensity, polarization, and spectrum, is demonstrated in article number 2207317 by Cesare Soci and co&#8208;workers. Monolithic integration of dielectric perovskite metasurfaces in the active region of electrically driven devices offers new routes for light control.

Long live the electron! Solar&#8208;energy conversion and long&#8208;term storage for on&#8208;demand electrical and chemical energy are crucial toward decentralized energy distribution. In article number 2207280, Julien Warnan and co&#8208;workers show how a hybrid material from a metal&#8211;organic framework and molecular rhenium complex enables light&#8208;driven accumulation of long&#8208;lived electrons. Full charge storage over several weeks is achieved as well as on&#8208;demand &#8220;dark photocatalysis&#8221; for decoupled hydrogen evolution.

         <title>Smart Eutectic Gallium&#8211;Indium: From Properties to Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review article gives a comprehensive overview of the unique properties and wide applications of liquid metal eutectic gallium&#8211;indium (EGaIn). The working principles for the EGaIn&#8208;based devices are illustrated and the developments of EGaIn&#8208;related techniques are summarized. The main challenges for the development of EGaIn&#8208;related techniques are analyzed and the potential applications of EGaIn in the new fields are prospected.








Abstract
Eutectic gallium&#8211;indium (EGaIn), a liquid metal with a melting point close to or below room temperature, has attracted extensive attention in recent years due to its excellent properties such as fluidity, high conductivity, thermal conductivity, stretchability, self&#8208;healing capability, biocompatibility, and recyclability. These features of EGaIn can be adjusted by changing the experimental condition, and various composite materials with extended properties can be further obtained by mixing EGaIn with other materials. In this review, not only the are unique properties of EGaIn introduced, but also the working principles for the EGaIn&#8208;based devices are illustrated and the developments of EGaIn&#8208;related techniques are summarized. The applications of EGaIn in various fields, such as flexible electronics (sensors, antennas, electronic circuits), molecular electronics (molecular memory, opto&#8208;electronic switches, or reconfigurable junctions), energy catalysis (heat management, motors, generators, batteries), biomedical science (drug delivery, tumor therapy, bioimaging and neural interfaces) are reviewed. Finally, a critical discussion of the main challenges for the development of EGaIn&#8208;based techniques are discussed, and the potential applications in new fields are prospected.

         <title>Recent Progress in Developing a LiOH&#8208;Based Reversible Nonaqueous Lithium&#8211;Air Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The progress in developing LiOH&#8208;based nonaqueous lithium&#8211;air batteries is reviewed, with emphasis in providing an updated understanding of the oxygen reduction/evolution reactions during cell operation. Many fundamental questions remain unanswered on the identities of the reaction intermediates, locations of reaction interfaces, causes of parasitic reactions, and the effect of CO2&#160;on the LiOH electrochemistry, which all warrant further investigation.








Abstract
The realization of practical nonaqueous lithium&#8211;air batteries (LABs) calls for novel strategies to address their numerous theoretical and technical challenges. LiOH formation/decomposition has recently been proposed as a promising alternative route to cycling LABs via Li2O2. Herein, the progress in developing LiOH&#8208;based nonaqueous LABs is reviewed. Various catalytic systems, either soluble or solid&#8208;state, that can activate a LiOH&#8208;based electrochemistry are compared in detail, with emphasis in providing an updated understanding of the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions in nonaqueous media.&#160;We&#160;identify the key factors that can switch the cell chemistry between Li2O2&#160;and LiOH and highlight the debate around these routes, as well as rationalize potential causes for these opposing opinions. The identities of the reaction intermediates, activity of redox mediators and additives, location of reaction interfaces, causes of parasitic reactions, as well as the effect of CO2&#160;on the LiOH electrochemistry, all play a critical role in altering the relative rates of a series of interconnected reactions and all warrant further investigation.

         <title>Tungsten&#8208;based Nanomaterials in the Biomedical Field: A Bibliometric Analysis of Research Progress and Prospects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The research progress and prospects of tungsten&#8208;based nanomaterials in biomedical field are analyzed by bibliometrics. First, general bibliometric distributions of the dataset by year/country/institute/referenced source/research hotspots are recognized. Next, to provide a comprehensive review of the subjectively recognized research hotspots in biomedical fields (including biological sensing, anticancer treatments, antibacterials, and toxicity evaluation). Finally, prospects and challenges are discussed.








Abstract
Tungsten&#8208;based nanomaterials (TNMs) with diverse nanostructures and unique physicochemical properties have been widely applied in the biomedical field. Although various reviews have described the application of TNMs in specific biomedical fields, there are still no comprehensive studies that summarize and analyze research trends of the field as a whole. To identify and further promote the development of biomedical TNMs, a bibliometric analysis method is used to analyze all relevant literature on this topic. First, general bibliometric distributions of the dataset by year, country, institute, referenced source, and research hotspots are recognized. Next, a comprehensive review of the subjectively recognized research hotspots in various biomedical fields, including biological sensing, anticancer treatments, antibacterials, and toxicity evaluation, is provided. Finally, the prospects and challenges of TNMs are discussed to provide a new perspective for further promoting their development in biomedical research.

         <dc:description>
This review presents the latest advances in Ag2Q&#8208;based (Q&#160;=&#160;S, Se, Te) silver chalcogenides that come forth as promising thermoelectric materials. These materials are endowed with complex structures, high carrier mobility coupled with low lattice thermal conductivity, and even exceptional plasticity, holding great promise in flexible or hetero&#8208;shaped thermoelectric applications.








Abstract
Thermoelectric technology provides a promising solution to sustainable energy utilization and scalable power supply. Recently, Ag2Q&#8208;based (Q&#160;=&#160;S, Se, Te) silver chalcogenides have come forth as potential thermoelectric materials that are endowed with complex crystal structures, high carrier mobility coupled with low lattice thermal conductivity, and even exceptional plasticity. This review presents the latest advances in this material family, from binary compounds to ternary and quaternary alloys, covering the understanding of multi&#8208;scale structures and peculiar properties, the optimization of thermoelectric performance, and the rational design of new materials. The &#8220;composition&#8208;phase structure&#8208;thermoelectric/mechanical properties&#8221; correlation is emphasized. Flexible and hetero&#8208;shaped thermoelectric prototypes based on Ag2Q materials are also demonstrated. Several key problems and challenges are put forward concerning further understanding and optimization of Ag2Q&#8208;based thermoelectric chalcogenides.
