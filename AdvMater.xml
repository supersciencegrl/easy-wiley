      <title>Metal Halide Perovskite Nanorods: Shape Matters</title>
      <dc:description>
Metal halide perovskite nanorods show strong polarized emission, high optical gain, and improved charge transport, and thus hold promising applications in solar cells, light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), photodetectors, photodetectors/phototransistors, and lasers. Recent advances in the synthetic strategies, growth mechanism, and optical and electronic properties of these materials are discussed, and the emerging applications are highlighted.








Abstract
Quasi&#8208;1D metal halide perovskite nanorods (NRs) are emerging as a type of materials with remarkable optical and electronic properties. Research into this field is rapidly expanding and growing in the past several years, with significant advances in both mechanistic studies of their growth and widespread possible applications. Here, the recent advances in 1D metal halide perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) are reviewed, with a particular emphasis on NRs. At first, the crystal structures of perovskites are elaborated, which is followed by a review of the major synthetic approaches toward perovskite NRs, such as wet&#8208;chemical synthesis, substrate&#8208;assisted growth, and anion exchange reactions, and discussion of the growth mechanisms associated with each synthetic method. Then, thermal and aqueous stability and the linear polarized luminescence of perovskite NRs are considered, followed by highlighting their applications in solar cells, light&#8208;emitting diodes, photodetectors/phototransistors, and lasers. Finally, challenges and future opportunities in this rapidly developing research area are summarized.

      <title>Memristors Based on 2D Materials as an Artificial Synapse for Neuromorphic Electronics</title>
      <dc:description>
The recent progress regarding memristors based on 2D materials for neuromorphic electronics is reviewed. They are categorized by their various materials, structures, and mechanisms. Owing to their outstanding synaptic characteristics, neuromorphic devices based on 2D materials offer excellent performance, energy&#8208;efficient operation, and modifiable synaptic functions applicable to complex learning.








Abstract
The memristor, a composite word of memory and resistor, has become one of the most important electronic components for brain&#8208;inspired neuromorphic computing in recent years. This device has the ability to control resistance with multiple states by memorizing the history of previous electrical inputs, enabling it to mimic a biological synapse in the neural network of the human brain. Among many candidates for memristive materials, including metal oxides, organic materials, and low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials, 2D layered materials have been widely investigated owing to their outstanding physical properties and electrical tunability, low&#8208;power&#8208;switching capability, and hetero&#8208;integration compatibility. Hence, a large number of experimental demonstrations on 2D material&#8208;based memristors have been reported showing their unique memristive characteristics and novel synaptic functionalities, distinct from traditional bulk&#8208;material&#8208;based systems. Herein, an overview of the latest advances in the structures, mechanisms, and memristive characteristics of 2D material&#8208;based memristors is presented. Additionally, novel strategies to modulate and enhance the synaptic functionalities of 2D&#8208;memristor&#8208;based artificial synapses are summarized. Finally, as a foreseeing perspective, the potentials and challenges of these emerging materials for future neuromorphic electronics are also discussed.

      <title>Recent Progress in Engineering the Atomic and Electronic Structure of Electrocatalysts via Cation Exchange Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>
Further development of electrocatalysts for renewable energy devices requires the design of catalytic materials at the atomic/electronic level, which is a grand challenge. The recent advances in the cation exchange strategy, a powerful tool for fine&#8208;tuning atomic/electronic structure of electrocatalysts through surface faceting, heteroatom doping, defects formation, and strain modulation, are reviewed.








Abstract
In the past few decades, tremendous advances have been made in electrocatalysis due to the rational design of electrocatalysts at the nanoscale level. Further development requires engineering electrocatalysts at the atomic level, which is a grand challenge. Here, the recent advances in cation exchange strategy, which is a powerful tool for fine&#8208;tuning atomic structure of electrocatalysts via surface faceting, heteroatom doping, defects formation, and strain modulation, are the main focus. Proper atomic structure engineering effectively adjusts the electronic structure, and thus enhances the electronic conductivity and facilitates the adsorption/desorption of reaction intermediates. By virtue, the cation exchange strategy greatly boosts the intrinsic and apparent activities of electrocatalysts and shows a great potential toward design of new energy conversion devices, such as water splitting devices and metal&#8211;air batteries. It is believed that cation exchange offers new insights and opportunities for the rational design of a new generation of electrocatalysts.

      <title>Air&#8208;Stable Low&#8208;Symmetry Narrow&#8208;Bandgap 2D Sulfide Niobium for Polarization Photodetection</title>
      <dc:description>
Novel 2D anisotropic sulfide niobium (NbS3) is introduced into the material family by demonstrating its in&#8208;plane structure, phonon vibrations, and electrical and optical anisotropies. Meaningfully, the NbS3 Schottky photodetectors exhibit broadband detection sensitivity (400&#8211;10&#8239;600&#160;nm), excellent response time (as fast as 11 &#181;s), photoelectrical dichroic ratio (1.84), and high&#8208;quality polarization imaging.








Abstract
Low&#8208;symmetry 2D materials with unique anisotropic optical and optoelectronic characteristics have attracted a lot of interest in fundamental research and manufacturing of novel optoelectronic devices. Exploring new and low&#8208;symmetry narrow&#8208;bandgap 2D materials will be rewarding for the development of nanoelectronics and nano&#8208;optoelectronics. Herein, sulfide niobium (NbS3), a novel transition metal trichalcogenide semiconductor with low&#8208;symmetry structure, is introduced into a narrowband 2D material with strong anisotropic physical properties both experimentally and theoretically. The indirect bandgap of NbS3 with highly anisotropic band structures slowly decreases from 0.42&#160;eV (monolayer) to 0.26&#160;eV (bulk). Moreover, NbS3 Schottky photodetectors have excellent photoelectric performance, which enables fast photoresponse (11.6 &#181;s), low specific noise current (4.6 &#215; 10&#8722;25 A2 Hz&#8722;1), photoelectrical dichroic ratio (1.84) and high&#8208;quality reflective polarization imaging (637 nm and 830&#160;nm). A room&#8208;temperature specific detectivity exceeding 107 Jones can be obtained at the wavelength of 3&#160;&#181;m. These excellent unique characteristics will make low&#8208;symmetry narrow&#8208;bandgap 2D materials become highly competitive candidates for future anisotropic optical investigations and mid&#8208;infrared optoelectronic applications.

Meaningfully, the NbS&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; Schottky photodetectors exhibit broadband detection sensitivity (400&#8211;10&#8239;600&#160;nm), excellent response time (as fast as 11 &#181;s), photoelectrical dichroic ratio (1.84), and high&#8208;quality polarization imaging.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low&#8208;symmetry 2D materials with unique anisotropic optical and optoelectronic characteristics have attracted a lot of interest in fundamental research and manufacturing of novel optoelectronic devices. Exploring new and low&#8208;symmetry narrow&#8208;bandgap 2D materials will be rewarding for the development of nanoelectronics and nano&#8208;optoelectronics. Herein, sulfide niobium (NbS&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), a novel transition metal trichalcogenide semiconductor with low&#8208;symmetry structure, is introduced into a narrowband 2D material with strong anisotropic physical properties both experimentally and theoretically. The indirect bandgap of NbS&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with highly anisotropic band structures slowly decreases from 0.42&#160;eV (monolayer) to 0.26&#160;eV (bulk). Moreover, NbS&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; Schottky photodetectors have excellent photoelectric performance, which enables fast photoresponse (11.6 &#181;s), low specific noise current (4.6 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;25&lt;/sup&gt; A&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Hz&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), photoelectrical dichroic ratio (1.84) and high&#8208;quality reflective polarization imaging (637 nm and 830&#160;nm). A room&#8208;temperature specific detectivity exceeding 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; Jones can be obtained at the wavelength of 3&#160;&#181;m. These excellent unique characteristics will make low&#8208;symmetry narrow&#8208;bandgap 2D materials become highly competitive candidates for future anisotropic optical investigations and mid&#8208;infrared optoelectronic applications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Broad&#8208;Spectral&#8208;Range Sustainability and Controllable Excitation of Hyperbolic Phonon Polaritons in &#945;&#8208;MoO3</title>
      <dc:description>
Hyperbolic phonon polaritons in &#945;&#8208;MoO3 are measured in a broad spectral range using electron energy loss spectroscopy. Polaritons with different dispersion types can be sustained in multiple Reststrahlen bands covering both mid&#8208; and far&#8208;infrared frequencies, and can be selectively excited by the electron beam. These findings provide new opportunities in nanophotonic applications such as directed light propagation and hyperlensing.








Abstract
Hyperbolic phonon polaritons (HPhPs) in orthorhombic&#8208;phase molybdenum trioxide (&#945;&#8208;MoO3) show in&#8208;plane hyperbolicity, great wavelength compression, and ultralong lifetime, therefore holding great potential in nanophotonic applications. However, its polaritonic response in the far&#8208;infrared (FIR) range remains unexplored due to challenges in experimental characterization. Here, monochromated electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) in a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) is used to probe HPhPs in &#945;&#8208;MoO3 in both mid&#8208;infrared (MIR) and FIR frequencies and correlate their behaviors with microstructures and orientations. It is found that low structural symmetry leads to various phonon modes and multiple Reststrahlen bands (RBs) over a broad spectral range (over 70 meV) and in different directions (55&#8211;63 meV and 119&#8211;125 meV along the b&#8208;axis, 68&#8211;106 meV along the c&#8208;axis, and 101&#8211;121 meV along the a&#8208;axis). These HPhPs can be selectively excited by controlling the direction of swift electrons. These findings provide new opportunities in nanophotonic and optoelectronic applications, such as directed light propagation, hyperlenses, and heat transfer.

Abstract
Transient electronics refers to an emerging class of advanced technology, defined by an ability to chemically or physically dissolve, disintegrate, and degrade in actively or passively controlled fashions to leave environmentally and physiologically harmless by&#8208;products in environments, particularly in bio&#8208;fluids or aqueous solutions.

      <title>Advances in the Design of 3D&#8208;Structured Electrode Materials for Lithium&#8211;Metal Anodes</title>
      <dc:description>
This progress report reviews the design of 3D&#8208;structured electrode materials for Li metal anode according to their categories, namely 1) metal&#8208;based materials, 2) carbon&#8208;based materials, and 3) their hybrids, and allows the results obtained under different experimental conditions to be seen at a single glance, thus being helpful for researchers working in related fields.








Abstract
Although the lithium&#8211;metal anode (LMA) can deliver a high theoretical capacity of &#8776;3860 mAh g&#8722;1 at a low redox potential of &#8722;3.040 V (vs the standard hydrogen electrode), its application in rechargeable batteries is hindered by the poor Coulombic efficiency and safety issues caused by dendritic metal growth. Consequently, careful electrode design, electrolyte engineering, solid&#8211;electrolyte interface control, protective layer introduction, and other strategies are suggested as possible solutions. In particular, one should note the great potential of 3D&#8208;structured electrode materials, which feature high active specific surface areas and stereoscopic structures with multitudinous lithiophilic sites and can therefore facilitate rapid Li&#8208;ion flux and metal nucleation as well as mitigate Li dendrite formation through the kinetic control of metal deposition even at high local current densities.

      <title>A Review of Shape Memory Polymers and Composites: Mechanisms, Materials, and Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
Shape memory polymers are promising stimuli&#8208;responsive materials that have provoked the interest of scientists over the past several decades. Progress in the mechanisms and applications of shape memory polymers is summarized, with a focus on the design and regulation of the shape memory effect. Future prospects and challenges in this exciting field are also proposed.








Abstract
Over the past decades, interest in shape memory polymers (SMPs) has persisted, and immense efforts have been dedicated to developing SMPs and their multifunctional composites. As a class of stimuli&#8208;responsive polymers, SMPs can return to their initial shape from a programmed temporary shape under external stimuli, such as light, heat, magnetism, and electricity. The introduction of functional materials and nanostructures results in shape memory polymer composites (SMPCs) with large recoverable deformation, enhanced mechanical properties, and controllable remote actuation. Because of these unique features, SMPCs have a broad application prospect in many fields covering aerospace engineering, biomedical devices, flexible electronics, soft robotics, shape memory arrays, and 4D printing. Herein, a comprehensive analysis of the shape recovery mechanisms, multifunctionality, applications, and recent advances in SMPs and SMPCs is presented. Specifically, the combination of functional, reversible, multiple, and controllable shape recovery processes is discussed. Further, established products from such materials are highlighted. Finally, potential directions for the future advancement of SMPs are proposed.

      <title>State of the Art and Perspectives of Hierarchical Zeolites: Practical Overview of Synthesis Methods and Use in Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>
A practical overview of the most recent literature on synthesis of hierarchical zeolites for most relevant zeolite topologies is presented. Several fine&#8208;tuning efforts of established and novel synthesis methods are discussed. Remaining challenges and points of attention and a personal view for future synthesis research to obtain the most sustainable and catalytically active hierarchical zeolites are also presented.








Abstract
Microporous zeolites have proven to be of great importance in many chemical processes. Yet, they often suffer from diffusion limitations causing inefficient use of the available catalytically active sites. To address this problem, hierarchical zeolites have been developed, which extensively improve the catalytic performance. There is a multitude of recent literature describing synthesis of and catalysis with these hierarchical zeolites. This review attempts to organize and overview this literature (of the last 5 years), with emphasis on the most important advances with regard to synthesis and application of such zeolites. Special attention is paid to the most common and important 10&#8208; and 12&#8208;membered ring zeolites (MTT, TON, FER, MFI, MOR, FAU, and *BEA). In contrast to previous reviews, the research per zeolite topology is brought together and discussed here. This allows the reader to instantly find the best synthesis method in accordance to the desired zeolite properties. A summarizing graph is made available to enable the reader to select suitable synthesis procedures based on zeolite acidity and mesoporosity, the two most important tunable properties.

      <title>A Self&#8208;Healing Amalgam Interface in Metal Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
An effective, universal strategy, introducing an amalgam interface, to resolve the interfacial issues of metal anodes/electrolytes toward high&#8208;performance metal batteries is presented. Such amalgam interface in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state symmetric cells, which shows a high electron/ion dual&#8208;conductivity, can undergo a reversible isothermal phase transition from solid (Li&#8208;rich amalgam) to liquid (Li&#8208;deficient amalgam) during cycling process at room temperature.








Abstract
Poor cyclability and safety concerns caused by the uncontrollable dendrite growth and large interfacial resistance severely restrict the practical applications of metal batteries. Herein, a facile, universal strategy to fabricate ceramic and glass phase compatible, and self&#8208;healing metal anodes is proposed. Various amalgam&#8208;metal anodes (Li, Na, Zn, Al, and Mg) show a long cycle life in symmetric cells. It has been found that liquid Li amalgam shows a complete wetting with the surface of lanthanum lithium titanate electrolyte and a glass&#8208;phase solid&#8208;state electrolyte. The interfacial compatibility between the lithium metal anode and solid&#8208;state electrolyte is dramatically improved by using an in situ regenerated amalgam interface with high electron/ion dual&#8208;conductivity, obviously decreasing the anode/electrolyte interfacial impedance. The lithium&#8208;amalgam interface between the metal anode and electrolyte undergoes a reversible isothermal phase transition between solid and liquid during the cycling process at room temperature, resulting in a self&#8208;healing surface of metal anodes.

      <title>Bio&#8208;Photonic Waveguide of a DNA&#8208;Hybrid Semiconductor Prismatic Hexagon</title>
      <dc:description>
DNA&#8211;DNA recognition is achieved based on the waveguide effect of a 1D hybrid prismatic hexagon crystal. This 1D hybrid&#8208;crystal can simultaneously discern one base mismatch of a sequence through waveguide performance.








Abstract
A successful identification of DNA&#8211;DNA recognition, based on the waveguide effect of a 1D hybrid prismatic hexagon crystal interfacing of DNA with an organic semiconductor is achieved. This bio&#8208;hybrid 1D crystal simultaneously discerns the complementary case at its one end against a 1&#8208;mer mismatch in 27&#8208;mer nucleic acid sequence at the other end. The loss coefficient value of this waveguide is estimated to be 0.159&#160;&#181;m&#8722;1 for the perfect match, which is a stark discrepancy compared to 0.244&#160;&#181;m&#8722;1 for the 1&#8208;mer mismatch, implying waveguide performance with a higher efficiency. These results demonstrate successfully that multiple&#160;biological interactions can be realized by the optical waveguide of the single&#160;1D bio&#8208;hybrid&#8208;crystal and will push this class of materials into bio&#8208;related applications.

      <title>Large&#8208;Area Single&#8208;Crystal Graphene via Self&#8208;Organization at the Macroscale</title>
      <dc:description>
Graphene flakes, nucleated over a polycrystalline graphene film, are shown to synchronize during growth, so as to ultimately yield a common crystal orientation at the macroscale, namely, large&#8208;area single&#8208;crystal growth. The work also demonstrates that graphene synthesis can be advanced to control the nucleated crystal shape, registry, and relative alignment between graphene crystals for wafer&#8208;scale areas.








Abstract
In 1665 Christiaan Huygens first noticed how two pendulums, regardless of their initial state, would synchronize.&#160; It is now known that the universe is full of complex self&#8208;organizing systems, from neural networks to correlated materials. Here, graphene flakes, nucleated over a polycrystalline graphene film, synchronize during growth so as to ultimately yield a common crystal orientation at the macroscale. Strain and diffusion gradients are argued as the probable causes for the long&#8208;range cross&#8208;talk between flakes and the formation of a single&#8208;grain graphene layer. The work demonstrates that graphene synthesis can be advanced to control the nucleated crystal shape, registry, and relative alignment between graphene crystals for large area, that is, a single&#8208;crystal bilayer, and (AB&#8208;stacked) few&#8208;layer graphene can been grown at the wafer scale.

      <title>Chelation Crosslinking of Biodegradable Elastomers</title>
      <dc:description>
A versatile metal chelation crosslink in biodegradable elastomers is reported. The types of metal ions, ligand density, and metal&#8211;ligand ratio offer fine control of the polymers&#8217; properties. A subcutaneous implantation in mice reveals higher biocompatibility than the widely use biomaterial, polycaprolactone.








Abstract
Widely present in nature and in manufactured goods, elastomers are network polymers typically crosslinked by strong covalent bonds. Elastomers crosslinked by weak bonds usually exhibit more plastic deformation. Here, chelation as a mechanism to produce biodegradable elastomers is reported. Polycondensation of sebacic acid, 1,3&#8208;propanediol, and a Schiff&#8208;base (2&#8208;[[(2&#8208;hydroxyphenyl) methylene]amino]&#8208;1,3&#8208;propanediol) forms a block copolymer that binds several biologically relevant metal ions. Chelation offers a unique advantage unseen in conventional elastomer design because one ligand binds multiple metal ions, yielding bonds of different strengths. Therefore, one polymeric ligand coordinated with different metal ions produces elastomers with vastly different characteristics. Mixing different metal ions in one polymer offers another degree of control on material properties. The density of the ligands in the block copolymer further regulates the mechanical properties. Moreover, a murine model reveals that Fe3+ crosslinked foam displays higher compatibility with subcutaneous tissues than the widely used biomaterial&#8212;polycaprolactone. The implantation sites restore to their normal architecture with little fibrosis upon degradation of the implants. The versatility of chelation&#8208;based design has already shown promise in hydrogels and highly stretchy nondegradable polymers. The biodegradable elastomers reported here would enable new materials and new possibilities in biomedicine and beyond.

      <title>Chemically Stable Black Phase CsPbI3 Inorganic Perovskites for High&#8208;Efficiency Photovoltaics</title>
      <dc:description>
The recent progress of CsPbI3 perovskite for highly efficient and stable photovoltaics are summarized. Furthermore, those important phase stabilization strategies for the black phase CsPbI3 are also discussed. With the advancing of fundamental study on CsPbI3 perovskite material properties, the CsPbI3 perovskite and other inorganic perovskite will become more and more promising for high&#8208;efficiency and stable perovskites solar cells.








Abstract
Research on chemically stable inorganic perovskites has achieved rapid progress in terms of high efficiency exceeding 19% and high thermal stabilities, making it one of the most promising candidates for thermodynamically stable and high&#8208;efficiency perovskite solar cells. Among those inorganic perovskites, CsPbI3 with good chemical components stability possesses the suitable bandgap (&#8776;1.7&#160;eV) for single&#8208;junction and tandem solar cells. Comparing to the anisotropic organic cations, the isotropic cesium cation without hydrogen bond and cation orientation renders CsPbI3 exhibit unique optoelectronic properties. However, the unideal tolerance factor of CsPbI3 induces the challenges of different crystal phase competition and room temperature phase stability. Herein, the latest important developments regarding understanding of the crystal structure and phase of CsPbI3 perovskite are presented. The development of various solution chemistry approaches for depositing high&#8208;quality phase&#8208;pure CsPbI3 perovskite is summarized. Furthermore, some important phase stabilization strategies for black phase CsPbI3 are discussed. The latest experimental and theoretical studies on the fundamental physical properties of photoactive phase CsPbI3 have deepened the understanding of inorganic perovskites. The future development and research directions toward achieving highly stable CsPbI3 materials will further advance inorganic perovskite for highly stable and efficient photovoltaics.

      <title>Mesoporous Nanoarchitectures for Electrochemical Energy Conversion and Storage</title>
      <dc:description>
Mesoporous nanomaterials have attracted significant attention in various important fields, especially as electrode materials or catalysts for energy storage and conversion devices. A comprehensive overview on the synthetic strategies and recent developments of mesoporous nanostructures, their electrochemical properties in energy storage and conversion systems, and future directions for design and synthesis of advanced mesoporous nanostructures is provided.








Abstract
Mesoporous materials have attracted considerable attention because of their distinctive properties, including high surface areas, large pore sizes, tunable pore structures, controllable chemical compositions, and abundant forms of composite materials. During the last decade, there has been increasing research interest in constructing advanced mesoporous nanomaterials possessing short and open channels with efficient mass diffusion capability and rich accessible active sites for electrochemical energy conversion and storage. Here, the synthesis, structures, and energy&#8208;related applications of mesoporous nanomaterials are the main focus. After a brief summary of synthetic methods of mesoporous nanostructures, the delicate design and construction of mesoporous nanomaterials are described in detail through precise tailoring of the particle sizes, pore sizes, and nanostructures. Afterward, their applications as electrode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries, supercapacitors, water&#8208;splitting electrolyzers, and fuel cells are discussed. Finally, the possible development directions and challenges of mesoporous nanomaterials for electrochemical energy conversion and storage are proposed.

     alt="Mesoporous Nanoarchitectures for Electrochemical Energy Conversion and Storage"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mesoporous nanomaterials have attracted significant attention in various important fields, especially as electrode materials or catalysts for energy storage and conversion devices. A comprehensive overview on the synthetic strategies and recent developments of mesoporous nanostructures, their electrochemical properties in energy storage and conversion systems, and future directions for design and synthesis of advanced mesoporous nanostructures is provided.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mesoporous materials have attracted considerable attention because of their distinctive properties, including high surface areas, large pore sizes, tunable pore structures, controllable chemical compositions, and abundant forms of composite materials. During the last decade, there has been increasing research interest in constructing advanced mesoporous nanomaterials possessing short and open channels with efficient mass diffusion capability and rich accessible active sites for electrochemical energy conversion and storage. Here, the synthesis, structures, and energy&#8208;related applications of mesoporous nanomaterials are the main focus. After a brief summary of synthetic methods of mesoporous nanostructures, the delicate design and construction of mesoporous nanomaterials are described in detail through precise tailoring of the particle sizes, pore sizes, and nanostructures. Afterward, their applications as electrode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries, supercapacitors, water&#8208;splitting electrolyzers, and fuel cells are discussed. Finally, the possible development directions and challenges of mesoporous nanomaterials for electrochemical energy conversion and storage are proposed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Filament&#8208;Free Bulk Resistive Memory Enables Deterministic Analogue Switching</title>
      <dc:description>
A resistive memory cell based on the electrochemical migration of oxygen vacancies for in&#8208;memory neuromorphic computing is presented. By using the average statistical behavior of all oxygen vacancies to store analogue information states, this cell overcomes the stochastic and unpredictable switching plaguing filament&#8208;forming memristors, and instead achieves linear, predictable, and deterministic switching.








Abstract
Digital computing is nearing its physical limits as computing needs and energy consumption rapidly increase. Analogue&#8208;memory&#8208;based neuromorphic computing can be orders of magnitude more energy efficient at data&#8208;intensive tasks like deep neural networks, but has been limited by the inaccurate and unpredictable switching of analogue resistive memory. Filamentary resistive random access memory (RRAM) suffers from stochastic switching due to the random kinetic motion of discrete defects in the nanometer&#8208;sized filament. In this work, this stochasticity is overcome by incorporating a solid electrolyte interlayer, in this case, yttria&#8208;stabilized zirconia (YSZ), toward eliminating filaments. Filament&#8208;free, bulk&#8208;RRAM cells instead store analogue states using the bulk point defect concentration, yielding predictable switching because the statistical ensemble behavior of oxygen vacancy defects is deterministic even when individual defects are stochastic. Both experiments and modeling show bulk&#8208;RRAM devices using TiO2&#8208;X switching layers and YSZ electrolytes yield deterministic and linear analogue switching for efficient inference and training. Bulk&#8208;RRAM solves many outstanding issues with memristor unpredictability that have inhibited commercialization, and can, therefore, enable unprecedented new applications for energy&#8208;efficient neuromorphic computing. Beyond RRAM, this work shows how harnessing bulk point defects in ionic materials can be used to engineer deterministic nanoelectronic materials and devices.

      <title>Near&#8208;Infrared AIE Dots with Chemiluminescence for Deep&#8208;Tissue Imaging</title>
      <dc:description>
Near&#8208;infrared chemiluminescence (NIR CL): A novel aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) luminogen named TBL is designed and the NIR CL emission of TBL dots can penetrate through 3 cm&#8208;thick pork ham, which is much better than NIR fluorescence and blue CL emission. Moreover, the successful differentiation of tumor and normal tissue makes this system promising for CL&#8208;guided tumor diagnosis and surgery.








Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) chemiluminescence (CL) emission is highly favorable for deep&#8208;tissue imaging, but chemically conjugated NIR CL emitters with the aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) property for biotechnology are seldom reported. Herein, an AIE&#8208;active NIR CL emitter, TBL, is synthesized by conjugating luminol unit with electron&#8208;accepting benzothiadiazole and an electron&#8208;donating triphenylamine, and subsequently TBL dots are prepared by using F127 as the surfactant. The CL emission of TBL dots can last continuously for over 60 min and can be employed for quantitative (in vitro) and qualitative (in vivo) detection of 1O2. Strikingly, the NIR CL emission can penetrate through tissues with a total thickness of over 3 cm, exhibiting significantly better performance than NIR fluorescence emission and blue CL emission. Moreover, the successful differentiation of tumor and normal tissues by TBL&#8208;based CL imaging in vivo also paves the way for CL&#8208;guided cancer diagnosis and surgery.

      <title>Fighting against Drug&#8208;Resistant Tumors using a Dual&#8208;Responsive Pt(IV)/Ru(II) Bimetallic Polymer</title>
      <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;responsive Pt(IV)/Ru(II) bimetallic polymer is designed to treat drug&#8208;resistant tumors in a patient&#8208;derived&#8208;xenograft (PDX) model. The polymer self&#8208;assembles into nanoparticles, which circulate in bloodstream, accumulate at tumor sites, and are taken up by drug&#8208;resistant cancer cells. The released cisplatin and Ru(II) complexes via intracellular reduction and light irradiation as well as photogenerated 1O2 inhibit the growth of drug&#8208;resistant tumors.








Abstract
Drug resistance is a major problem in cancer treatment. Herein, the design of a dual&#8208;responsive Pt(IV)/Ru(II) bimetallic polymer (PolyPt/Ru) to treat cisplatin&#8208;resistant tumors in a patient&#8208;derived xenograft (PDX) model is reported. PolyPt/Ru is an amphiphilic ABA&#8208;type triblock copolymer. The hydrophilic A blocks consist of biocompatible poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). The hydrophobic B block contains reduction&#8208;responsive Pt(IV) and red&#8208;light&#8208;responsive Ru(II) moieties. PolyPt/Ru self&#8208;assembles into nanoparticles that are efficiently taken up by cisplatin&#8208;resistant cancer cells. Irradiation of cancer cells containing PolyPt/Ru nanoparticles with red light generates 1O2, induces polymer degradation, and triggers the release of the Ru(II) anticancer agent. Meanwhile, the anticancer drug, cisplatin, is released in the intracellular environment via reduction of the Pt(IV) moieties. The released Ru(II) anticancer agent, cisplatin, and the generated 1O2 have different anticancer mechanisms; their synergistic effects inhibit the growth of drug&#8208;resistant cancer cells. Furthermore, PolyPt/Ru nanoparticles inhibit tumor growth in a PDX mouse model because they circulate in the bloodstream, accumulate at tumor sites, exhibit good biocompatibility, and do not cause side effects. The results demonstrate that the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive multi&#8208;metallic polymers provides a new strategy to overcome drug resistance.

      <title>Beyond Substrates: Strain Engineering of Ferroelectric Membranes</title>
      <dc:description>
Upon release from their growth substrates, the properties of single&#8208;crystal ferroelectric BaTiO3 membranes integrated on silicon are tuned via the interlayer stress from epitaxially coupled electrode layers where the removal of substrate clamping improves the polarization switching speed. Using this strategy, highly sensitive mechanical control of the dielectric properties in membranes integrated on polymers is also demonstrated.








Abstract
Strain engineering in perovskite oxides provides for dramatic control over material structure, phase, and properties, but is restricted by the discrete strain states produced by available high&#8208;quality substrates. Here, using the ferroelectric BaTiO3, production of precisely strain&#8208;engineered, substrate&#8208;released nanoscale membranes is demonstrated via an epitaxial lift&#8208;off process that allows the high crystalline quality of films grown on substrates to be replicated. In turn, fine structural tuning is achieved using interlayer stress in symmetric trilayer oxide&#8208;metal/ferroelectric/oxide&#8208;metal structures fabricated from the released membranes. In devices integrated on silicon, the interlayer stress provides deterministic control of ordering temperature (from 75&#160;to 425&#160;&#176;C) and releasing the substrate clamping is shown to dramatically impact ferroelectric switching and domain dynamics (including reducing coercive fields to &lt;10&#160;kV cm&#8722;1 and improving switching times to &lt;5&#160;ns for a 20&#160;&#181;m diameter capacitor in a 100&#8208;nm&#8208;thick film). In devices integrated on flexible polymers, enhanced room&#8208;temperature dielectric permittivity with large mechanical tunability (a 90% change upon &#177;0.1%&#160;strain application) is demonstrated. This approach paves the way toward the fabrication of ultrafast CMOS&#8208;compatible ferroelectric memories and ultrasensitive flexible nanosensor devices, and it may also be leveraged for the stabilization of novel phases and functionalities not achievable via direct epitaxial growth.

      <title>Liquid&#8208;Metal Synthesized Ultrathin SnS Layers for High&#8208;Performance Broadband Photodetectors</title>
      <dc:description>
Miniaturized photodetectors are key for the next generation of sensing, communication, and imaging technologies. Single&#8208;atom&#8208;thick SnS layers are printed on a millimeter scale to showcase application in high&#8208;performance photodetectors. These SnS&#8208;based ultrafast photodetectors show a broadband spectral response ranging from deep ultraviolet to near infrared wavelengths (i.e., 280 to 850&#160;nm) with excellent figures of merit.








Abstract
Atomically thin materials face an ongoing challenge of scalability, hampering practical deployment despite their fascinating properties. Tin monosulfide (SnS), a low&#8208;cost, naturally abundant layered material with a tunable bandgap, displays properties of superior carrier mobility and large absorption coefficient at atomic thicknesses, making it attractive for electronics and optoelectronics. However, the lack of successful synthesis techniques to prepare large&#8208;area and stoichiometric atomically thin SnS layers (mainly due to the strong interlayer interactions) has prevented exploration of these properties for versatile applications. Here, SnS layers are printed with thicknesses varying from a single unit cell (0.8 nm) to multiple stacked unit cells (&#8776;1.8 nm) synthesized from metallic liquid tin, with lateral dimensions on the millimeter scale. It is reveal that these large&#8208;area SnS layers exhibit a broadband spectral response ranging from deep&#8208;ultraviolet (UV) to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) wavelengths (i.e., 280&#8211;850 nm) with fast photodetection capabilities. For single&#8208;unit&#8208;cell&#8208;thick layered SnS, the photodetectors show upto three orders of magnitude higher responsivity (927 A W&#8722;1) than commercial photodetectors at a room&#8208;temperature operating wavelength of 660 nm. This study opens a new pathway to synthesize reproduceable nanosheets of large lateral sizes for broadband, high&#8208;performance photodetectors.

     alt="Liquid&#8208;Metal Synthesized Ultrathin SnS Layers for High&#8208;Performance Broadband Photodetectors"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miniaturized photodetectors are key for the next generation of sensing, communication, and imaging technologies. Single&#8208;atom&#8208;thick SnS layers are printed on a millimeter scale to showcase application in high&#8208;performance photodetectors. These SnS&#8208;based ultrafast photodetectors show a broadband spectral response ranging from deep ultraviolet to near infrared wavelengths (i.e., 280 to 850&#160;nm) with excellent figures of merit.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atomically thin materials face an ongoing challenge of scalability, hampering practical deployment despite their fascinating properties. Tin monosulfide (SnS), a low&#8208;cost, naturally abundant layered material with a tunable bandgap, displays properties of superior carrier mobility and large absorption coefficient at atomic thicknesses, making it attractive for electronics and optoelectronics. However, the lack of successful synthesis techniques to prepare large&#8208;area and stoichiometric atomically thin SnS layers (mainly due to the strong interlayer interactions) has prevented exploration of these properties for versatile applications. Here, SnS layers are printed with thicknesses varying from a single unit cell (0.8 nm) to multiple stacked unit cells (&#8776;1.8 nm) synthesized from metallic liquid tin, with lateral dimensions on the millimeter scale. It is reveal that these large&#8208;area SnS layers exhibit a broadband spectral response ranging from deep&#8208;ultraviolet (UV) to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) wavelengths (i.e., 280&#8211;850 nm) with fast photodetection capabilities. For single&#8208;unit&#8208;cell&#8208;thick layered SnS, the photodetectors show upto three orders of magnitude higher responsivity (927 A W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) than commercial photodetectors at a room&#8208;temperature operating wavelength of 660 nm. This study opens a new pathway to synthesize reproduceable nanosheets of large lateral sizes for broadband, high&#8208;performance photodetectors. It also provides important technological implications for scalable applications in integrated optoelectronic circuits, sensing, and biomedical imaging.&lt;/p&gt;

In article number 2002854, Un Jeong Kim, Hyungbin Son, and co&#8208;workers use phase&#8208;shifting interferometry to quickly obtain morphological information of atomic&#8208;scale structures on transferred graphene over a large area. The obtained morphological information includes wrinkles, various polymer residues, and tearing/opening of the transferred graphene, and it can be used to evaluate the quality of the transferred graphene, such as the physical integrity, thickness, and adhesive strength to the target substrate.

      <title>Scalable Fabrication of Molybdenum Disulfide Nanostructures and their Assembly</title>
      <dc:description>
Molybdenum disulfide nanoribbons and their oxide hybrids with tunable dimensions from several to tens of micrometers are fabricated in a scalable and reproducible fashion. They disperse in suspension, transport along prescribed trajectories with electric manipulation, and instantly assemble upon UV&#8208;click chemical reaction at the &#8220;press of a light button.&#8221; The nanoribbons demonstrate rapid optoelectric response and effectively remove mercury from solution.








Abstract
Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is a multifunctional material that can be used for various applications. In the single&#8208;crystalline form, MoS2 shows superior electronic properties. It is also an exceptionally useful nanomaterial in its polycrystalline form with applications in catalysis, energy storage, water treatment, and gas sensing. Here, the scalable fabrication of longitudinal MoS2 nanostructures, i.e., nanoribbons, and their oxide hybrids with tunable dimensions in a rational and well&#8208;reproducible fashion, is reported. The nanoribbons, obtained at different reaction stages, that is, MoO3, MoS2/MoO2 hybrid, and MoS2, are fully characterized. The growth method presented herein has a high yield and is particularly robust. The MoS2 nanoribbons can readily be removed from its substrate and dispersed in solution. It is shown that functionalized MoS2 nanoribbons can be manipulated in solution and assembled in controlled patterns and directly on microelectrodes with UV&#8208;click&#8208;chemistry. Owing to the high chemical purity and polycrystalline nature, the MoS2 nanostructures demonstrate rapid optoelectronic response to wavelengths from 450 to 750&#160;nm, and successfully remove mercury contaminants from water. The scalable fabrication and manipulation followed by light&#8208;directed assembly of MoS2 nanoribbons, and their unique properties, will be inspiring for device fabrication and applications of the transition metal dichalcogenides.

      <title>Nanoparticle&#8208;Based Electrodes with High Charge Transfer Efficiency through Ligand Exchange Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Assembly</title>
      <dc:description>
Various energy electrodes using high&#8208;energy nanoparticles (NPs) have great difficulty in enhancing their performance due to poor charge transfer between neighboring NPs, which mainly originates from the presence of bulky organic ligands onto the NPs. Recent progress on the control over organic ligands of energy NPs and adsorption approaches for the preparation of high&#8208;performance energy electrodes is introduced.








Abstract
Organic&#8208;ligand&#8208;based solution processes of metal and transition metal oxide (TMO) nanoparticles (NPs) have been widely studied for the preparation of electrode materials with desired electrical and electrochemical properties for various energy devices. However, the ligands adsorbed on NPs have a significant effect on the intrinsic properties of materials, thus influencing the performance of bulk electrodes assembled by NPs for energy devices. To resolve these critical drawbacks, numerous approaches have focused on developing unique surface chemistry that can exchange bulky ligands with small ligands or remove bulky ligands from NPs after NP deposition. In particular, recent studies have reported that the ligand&#8208;exchange&#8208;induced layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LE&#8208;LbL) assembly of NPs enables controlled assembly of NPs with the desired interparticle distance, and interfaces, dramatically improving the electrical/electrochemical performance of electrodes. This emerging approach also demonstrates that efficient surface ligand engineering can exploit the unique electrochemical properties of individual NPs and maximize the electrochemical performance of the resultant NP&#8208;assembled electrodes through improved charge transfer efficiency. This report focuses on how LE&#8208;LbL assembly can be effectively applied to NP&#8208;based energy storage/conversion electrodes. First, the basic principles of the LE&#8208;LbL approach are introduced and then recent progress on NP&#8208;based energy electrodes prepared via the LE&#8208;LbL approach is reviewed.

      <title>High Throughput Methods in the Synthesis, Characterization, and Optimization of Porous Materials</title>
      <dc:description>
High throughput synthetic, computational, and analytic/machine learning approaches applied to porous materials are reviewed. The benefits of a virtuous circle, where there is feedback between each strand of research, are highlighted.








Abstract
Porous materials are widely employed in a large range of applications, in particular, for storage, separation, and catalysis of fine chemicals. Synthesis, characterization, and pre&#8208; and post&#8208;synthetic computer simulations are mostly carried out in a piecemeal and ad hoc manner. Whilst high throughput approaches have been used for more than 30 years in the porous material fields, routine integration of experimental and computational processes is only now becoming more established. Herein, important developments are highlighted and emerging challenges for the community identified, including the need to work toward more integrated workflows.

      <title>Shape Changing Robots: Bioinspiration, Simulation, and Physical Realization</title>
      <dc:description>
Biological tissues exhibit incredible dynamic plasticity, enabling organisms to grow and thrive in challenging environments.

Abstract
One of the key differentiators between biological and artificial systems is the dynamic plasticity of living tissues, enabling adaptation to different environmental conditions, tasks, or damage by reconfiguring physical structure and behavioral control policies. Lack of dynamic plasticity is a significant limitation for artificial systems that must robustly operate in the natural world. Recently, researchers have begun to leverage insights from regenerating and metamorphosing organisms, designing robots capable of editing their own structure to more efficiently perform tasks under changing demands and creating new algorithms to control these changing anatomies. Here, an overview of the literature related to robots that change shape to enhance and expand their functionality is presented. Related grand challenges, including shape sensing, finding, and changing, which rely on innovations in multifunctional materials, distributed actuation and sensing, and somatic control to enable next&#8208;generation shape changing robots are also&#160;discussed.

These findings facilitate new opportunities for the development of next&#8208;generation transparent electrochemical devices.








Abstract
Newly born zinc&#8208;anode&#8208;based electrochromic devices (ZECDs), incorporating electrochromic and energy storage functions in a single transparent platform, represent the most promising technology for next&#8208;generation transparent electronics. As the existing ZECDs are limited by opaque zinc anodes, the key focus should be on the development of transparent zinc anodes. Here, the first demonstration of a flexible transparent zinc&#8208;mesh electrode is reported for a ZECD window that yields a remarkable electrochromic performance in an 80 cm2 device, including rapid switching times (3.6 and 2.5 s for the coloration and bleaching processes, respectively), a high optical contrast (67.2%), and an excellent coloration efficiency (131.5 cm2 C&#8722;1). It is also demonstrated that such ZECDs are perfectly suited for solar&#8208;charging smart windows as they inherently address the solar intermittency issue. These windows can be colored via solar charging during the day, and they can be bleached during the night by supplying electrical energy to electronic devices. The ZECD smart window platform can be scaled to a large area while retaining its excellent electrochromic characteristics. These findings represent a new technology for solar&#8208;charging windows and open new opportunities for the development of next&#8208;generation transparent batteries.

      <title>A Narrow&#8208;Bandgap n&#8208;Type Polymer with an Acceptor&#8211;Acceptor Backbone Enabling Efficient All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
A narrow&#8208;bandgap polymer acceptor L14 with an acceptor&#8211;acceptor (A&#8211;A) backbone is synthesized, showing lower&#8208;lying frontier molecular orbitals, higher electron mobility, and larger absorption coefficient without sacrificing photovoltage compared to its donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) analog polymer, L11. When applied in all&#8208;polymer solar cells, L14 yields an outstanding efficiency of 14.3%.








Abstract
Narrow&#8208;bandgap polymer semiconductors are essential for advancing the development of organic solar cells. Here, a new narrow&#8208;bandgap polymer acceptor L14, featuring an acceptor&#8211;acceptor (A&#8211;A) type backbone, is synthesized by copolymerizing a dibrominated fused&#8208;ring electron acceptor (FREA) with distannylated bithiophene imide. Combining the advantages of both the FREA and the A&#8211;A polymer, L14 not only shows a narrow bandgap and high absorption coefficient, but also low&#8208;lying frontier molecular orbital (FMO) levels. Such FMO levels yield improved electron transfer character, but unexpectedly, without sacrificing open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc), which is attributed to a small nonradiative recombination loss (Eloss,nr) of 0.22 eV. Benefiting from the improved photocurrent along with the high fill factor and Voc, an excellent efficiency of 14.3% is achieved, which is among the highest values for all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs). The results demonstrate the superiority of narrow&#8208;bandgap A&#8211;A type polymers for improving all&#8208;PSC performance and pave a way toward developing high&#8208;performance polymer acceptors for all&#8208;PSCs.

      <title>Interface Engineering in Multiphase Systems toward Synthetic Cells and Organelles: From Soft Mater Fundamentals to Biomedical Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
Engineered liquid&#8211;liquid interfaces of multiphase systems are effective for constructing compartmentalized cell&#8208;mimicking systems. Key features and examples of synthetic cells including lipid vesicles, polymer vesicles, hybrid systems and coacervate droplets are outlined, and their imitative biological behaviors such as growth, fusion, and energy conversion are summarized.

Abstract
Synthetic cells have a major role in gaining insight into the complex biological processes of living cells; they also give rise to a range of emerging applications from gene delivery to enzymatic nanoreactors. Living cells rely on compartmentalization to orchestrate reaction networks for specialized and coordinated functions. Principally, the compartmentalization has been an essential engineering theme in constructing cell&#8208;mimicking systems. Here, efforts to engineer liquid&#8211;liquid interfaces of multiphase systems into membrane&#8208;bounded and membraneless compartments, which include lipid vesicles, polymer vesicles, colloidosomes, hybrids, and coacervate droplets, are summarized. Examples are provided of how these compartments are designed to imitate biological behaviors or machinery, including molecule trafficking, growth, fusion, energy conversion, intercellular communication, and adaptivity. Subsequently, the state&#8208;of&#8208;art applications of these cell&#8208;inspired synthetic compartments are discussed. Apart from being simplified and cell models for bridging the gap between nonliving matter and cellular life, synthetic compartments also are utilized as intracellular delivery vehicles for nuclei acids and nanoreactors for biochemical synthesis. Finally, key challenges and future directions for achieving the full potential of synthetic cells are highlighted.

      <title>Tunable Piezoelectricity of Multifunctional Boron Nitride Nanotube/Poly(dimethylsiloxane) Stretchable Composites</title>
      <dc:description>
Boron nitride nanotube/poly(dimethylsiloxane) (BNNT/PDMS) stretchable composites are prepared via co&#8208;solvent blending with tetrahydrofuran. The composites demonstrate augmented Young's modulus and thermal conductivity without losing stretchability while developing a piezoelectric response comparable to widely used piezoelectric polymers. Uniquely, application of strain reversibly aligns BNNTs, further enhancing piezoelectric response and permitting applications as low&#8208;frequency&#8208;vibration detectors.








Abstract
Boron nitride nanotubes (BNNT) uniformly dispersed in stretchable materials, such as poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS), could create the next generation of composites with augmented mechanical, thermal, and piezoelectric characteristics. This work reports tunable piezoelectricity of multifunctional BNNT/PDMS stretchable composites prepared via co&#8208;solvent blending with tetrahydrofuran (THF) to disperse BNNTs in PDMS while avoiding sonication or functionalization. The resultant stretchable BNNT/PDMS composites demonstrate augmented Young's modulus (200% increase at 9 wt% BNNT) and thermal conductivity (120% increase at 9 wt% BNNT) without losing stretchability. Furthermore, BNNT/PDMS composites demonstrate piezoelectric responses that are linearly proportional to BNNT wt%, achieving a piezoelectric constant (|d33|) of 18 pmV&#8722;1 at 9 wt% BNNT without poling, which is competitive with commercial piezoelectric polymers. Uniquely, BNNT/PDMS accommodates tensile strains up to 60% without plastic deformation by aligning BNNTs, which enhances the composites&#8217; piezoelectric response approximately five times. Finally, the combined stretchable and piezoelectric nature of the composite was exploited to produce a vibration sensor sensitive to low&#8208;frequency (&#8776;1 kHz) excitation. This is the first demonstration of multifunctional, stretchable BNNT/PDMS composites with enhanced mechanical strength and thermal conductivity and furthermore tunable piezoelectric response by varying BNNT wt% and applied strain, permitting applications in soft actuators and vibration sensors.

      <title>Plasmonic Oxygen&#8208;Deficient TiO2&#8208;x Nanocrystals for Dual&#8208;Band Electrochromic Smart Windows with Efficient Energy Recycling</title>
      <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;band electrochromic smart window assembled using a plasmonic oxygen&#8208;deficient TiO2&#8208;x nanocrystal electrode not only successfully overcomes the issues of aliovalent substitutional doping in dual&#8208;band electrochromic applications, but also delivers the independent control of visible light and near&#8208;infrared with impressive electrochromic performance and efficient energy recycling, which can significantly reduce the energy consumption of buildings and electrochromic devices.








Abstract
Dual&#8208;band electrochromic smart windows capable of the spectrally selective modulation of visible (VIS) light and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) can regulate solar light and solar heat transmittance to reduce the building energy consumption. The development of these windows is however limited by the number of available dual&#8208;band electrochromic materials. Here, plasmonic oxygen&#8208;deficient TiO2&#8208;x nanocrystals (NCs) are discovered to be an effective single&#8208;component dual&#8208;band electrochromic material, and that oxygen&#8208;vacancy creation is more effective than aliovalent substitutional doping to introduce dual&#8208;band properties to TiO2 NCs. Oxygen vacancies not only confer good near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;selective modulation, but also improve the Li+ diffusion in the TiO2&#8208;x host, circumventing the disadvantage of aliovalent substitutional doping with ion diffusion. Consequently optimized TiO2&#8208;x NC films are able to modulate the NIR and visible light transmittance independently and effectively in three distinct modes with high optical modulation (95.5% at 633&#160;nm and 90.5% at 1200&#160;nm), fast switching speed, high bistability, and long cycle life. An impressive dual&#8208;band electrochromic performance is also demonstrated in prototype devices. The use of TiO2&#8208;x NCs enables the assembled windows to recycle a large fraction of energy consumed in the coloration process (&#8220;energy recycling&#8221;) to reduce the energy consumption in a round&#8208;trip electrochromic operation.

An impressive dual&#8208;band electrochromic performance is also demonstrated in prototype devices. The use of TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&#8208;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; NCs enables the assembled windows to recycle a large fraction of energy consumed in the coloration process (&#8220;energy recycling&#8221;) to reduce the energy consumption in a round&#8208;trip electrochromic operation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Experimentalist's Guide to the Cycloid, or Noncollinear Antiferromagnetism in Epitaxial BiFeO3</title>
      <dc:description>
A thorough, critical review of the literature concerning the room&#8208;temperature multiferroic BiFeO3 is presented. Specifically, research exploring the structure and behavior of the incommensurate spin cycloid is addressed. After elucidating the importance of this magnetic oxide for functional devices and nanotechnologies, possible techniques for probing the spin cycloid, alongside perturbations and behavior under various external stimuli, are discussed.








Abstract
Bismuth ferrite (BiFeO3) is one of the most widely studied multiferroics. The coexistence of ferroelectricity and antiferromagnetism in this compound has driven an intense search for electric&#8208;field control of the magnetic order. Such efforts require a complete understanding of the various exchange interactions that underpin the magnetic behavior. An important characteristic of BiFeO3 is its noncollinear magnetic order; namely, a long&#8208;period incommensurate spin cycloid. Here, the progress in understanding this fascinating aspect of BiFeO3 is reviewed, with a focus on epitaxial films. The advances made in developing the theory used to capture the complexities of the cycloid are first chronicled, followed by a description of the various experimental techniques employed to probe the magnetic order. To help the reader fully grasp the nuances associated with thin films, a detailed description of the spin cycloid in the bulk is provided. The effects of various perturbations on the cycloid are then described: magnetic and electric fields, doping, epitaxial strain, finite size effects, and temperature. To conclude, an outlook on possible device applications exploiting noncollinear magnetism in BiFeO3 films is presented. It is hoped that this work will act as a comprehensive experimentalist's guide to the spin cycloid in BiFeO3 thin films.

      <title>Liquid Metal Initiator of Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization: Self&#8208;Capsulation into Thermal/Photomoldable Powder for Multifunctional Composites</title>
      <dc:description>
Ring&#8208;opening polymerization initiated by sonicating EGaIn in fluidic lactones enables self&#8208;capsulation of EGaIn droplets into polylactone shells with tunable thickness. With thermal/photomoldability, biocompatibility, biodegradability, and high photothermal efficiency, powder of EGaIn capsules is ideal for multifunctional composites (e.g., with sintering ability, notch&#8208;insensitive tearing property, electric conductivity, and photothermal effect), applicable in stretchable electronics, biomedicines, and smart materials.








Abstract
Liquid metal nanodroplets not only share similar metallic properties and nanoscale effect with solid metal nanoparticles, but also possess the additional uniqueness in nonvolatile fluidity and ambient sintering ability into continuous conductors. In most cases, liquid metal nanodroplets are encapsulated into ultrathin and fragile shells of oxides and amphiphile monolayers, and may be hindered from incorporating homogeneously into various composites through conventional processing methods. In this study, ring&#8208;opening polymerization is found to be initiated by sonicating the liquid metal EGaIn in fluidic lactones. By this in situ polymerization, EGaIn nanodroplets are encapsulated into polylactone shells with tunable thickness, which can further be dried into a solid powder. Besides high chemical stability and dispersibility in organic solvents, the powder of the EGaIn capsules combines the exceptional properties of the EGaIn droplets (e.g., photothermal effect) and the polylactone shells (e.g., biocompatibility, biodegradability, and compatibility with different polymer matrixes), being capable of being introduced into thermoplastic composites through liquid casting and thermal&#8208; or photomolding for the notch&#8208;insensitive tearing property, sintering&#8208;induced electric conductivity, and photothermal effect. Thus, the EGaIn initiator of ring&#8208;opening polymerization may start a pathway to produce stable andthermal/photomoldable powders of EGaIn capsules and their multifunctionalcomposites, applicable in biomedicines, soft electronics, and smart robots.

      <title>Synergistic Interface&#8208;Assisted Electrode&#8211;Electrolyte Coupling Toward Advanced Charge Storage</title>
      <dc:description>
A &#8220;smart&#8221; Co3O4&#8211;redox electrolyte (RE) interface that not only significantly increases the electrochemical activity of Co3O4 but also effectively confines the redox species is created, thus simultaneously achieving remarkable enhancement of faradaic charge storage capability and suppressed self&#8208;discharge. With such a synergistic interface, the energy density of RE&#8208;enhanced aqueous rechargeable batteries can be effectively increased without compromising the low self&#8208;discharge.








Abstract
Owing to the limited charge storage capability of transitional metal oxides in aqueous electrolytes, the use of redox electrolytes (RE) represents a promising strategy to further increase the energy density of aqueous batteries or pseudocapacitors. The usual coupling of an electrode and an RE possesses weak electrode/RE interaction and weak adsorption of redox moieties on the electrode, resulting in a low capacity contribution and fast self&#8208;discharge. In this work, Fe(CN)64&#8722; groups are grafted on the surface of Co3O4 electrode via formation of Co&#63743;N bonds, creating a synergistic interface between the electrode and the RE. With such an interface, the coupled Co3O4&#8211;RE system exhibits greatly enhanced charge storage from both Co3O4 and RE, delivering a large reversible capacity of &#8776;1000 mC cm&#8722;2 together with greatly reduced self&#8208;discharge. The significantly improved electrochemical activity of Co3O4 can be attributed to the tuned work function via charge injection from Fe(CN)64&#8722;, while the greatly enhanced adsorption of K3Fe(CN)6 molecules is achieved by the interface induced dipole&#8211;dipole interaction on the liquid side. Furthermore, this enhanced electrode&#8211;electrolyte coupling is also applicable in the NiO&#8211;RE system, demonstrating that the synergistic interface design can be a general strategy to integrate electrode and electrolyte for high&#8208;performance energy storage devices.

      <title>Multifunctional Polymer&#8208;Regulated SnO2 Nanocrystals Enhance Interface Contact for Efficient and Stable Planar Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
A biological polymer is employed to regulate the arrangement of SnO2 nanocrystals on a substrate and induce vertical crystal growth of a perovskite layer on top. The enhanced interface contact between the electron transport layer and the perovskite layer significantly contributes to the improvement of efficiency and stability of derived planar perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have rapidly developed and achieved power conversion efficiencies of over 20% with diverse technical routes. Particularly, planar&#8208;structured PSCs can be fabricated with low&#8208;temperature (&#8804;150 &#176;C) solution&#8208;based processes, which is energy efficient and compatible with flexible substrates. Here, the efficiency and stability of planar PSCs are enhanced by improving the interface contact between the SnO2 electron&#8208;transport layer (ETL) and the perovskite layer. A biological polymer (heparin potassium, HP) is introduced to regulate the arrangement of SnO2 nanocrystals, and induce vertically aligned crystal growth of perovskites on top. Correspondingly, SnO2&#8211;HP&#8208;based devices can demonstrate an average efficiency of 23.03% on rigid substrates with enhanced open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.162 V and high reproducibility. Attributed to the strengthened interface binding, the devices obtain high operational stability, retaining 97% of their initial performance (power conversion efficiency, PCE &gt; 22%) after 1000 h operation at their maximum power point under 1 sun illumination. Besides, the HP&#8208;modified SnO2 ETL exhibits promising potential for application in flexible and large&#8208;area devices.

      <title>Multimodal Luminescent Yb3+/Er3+/Bi3+&#8208;Doped Perovskite Single Crystals for X&#8208;ray Detection and Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting</title>
      <dc:description>
A Yb3+/Er3+/Bi3+ co&#8208;doped Cs2Ag0.6Na0.4InCl6 double&#8208;perovskite material shows multi&#8208;modal luminescence under excitation by X&#8208;rays, ultraviolet light, and near&#8208;infrared laser (980&#160;nm), which also features high stability against humidity and high temperature (up to 400&#160;&#176;C). This luminescence material further extends the functionality and potential for future commercial applications in anti&#8208;counterfeiting and X&#8208;ray detection.








Abstract
Anti&#8208;counterfeiting techniques have become a global topic since they is correlated to the information and data safety, in which multimodal luminescence is one of the most desirable candidates for practical applications. However, it is a long&#8208;standing challenge to actualize robust multimodal luminescence with high thermal stability and humid resistance. Conventionally, the multimodal luminescence is usually achieved by the combination of upconversion and downshifting luminescence, which only responds to the electromagnetic waves in a limited range. Herein, the Yb3+/Er3+/Bi3+ co&#8208;doped Cs2Ag0.6Na0.4InCl6 perovskite material is reported as an efficient multimodal luminescence material. Beyond the excitation of ultraviolet light and near&#8208;infrared laser (980&#160;nm), this work extends multimodal luminescence to the excitation of X&#8208;ray. Besides the flexible excitation sources, this material also shows the exceptional luminescence performance, in which the X&#8208;ray detection limit reaches the level of nGy s&#8722;1, indicating a great potential for further application as a colorless pigment in the anti&#8208;counterfeiting field. More importantly, the obtained double perovskite features high stability against both humidity and temperature up to 400&#160;&#176;C. This integrated multifunctional luminescent material provides a new directional solution for the development of multifunctional optical materials and devices.

This luminescence material further extends the functionality and potential for future commercial applications in anti&#8208;counterfeiting and X&#8208;ray detection.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anti&#8208;counterfeiting techniques have become a global topic since they is correlated to the information and data safety, in which multimodal luminescence is one of the most desirable candidates for practical applications. However, it is a long&#8208;standing challenge to actualize robust multimodal luminescence with high thermal stability and humid resistance. Conventionally, the multimodal luminescence is usually achieved by the combination of upconversion and downshifting luminescence, which only responds to the electromagnetic waves in a limited range. Herein, the Yb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;/Er&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;/Bi&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; co&#8208;doped Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ag&lt;sub&gt;0.6&lt;/sub&gt;Na&lt;sub&gt;0.4&lt;/sub&gt;InCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite material is reported as an efficient multimodal luminescence material. Beyond the excitation of ultraviolet light and near&#8208;infrared laser (980&#160;nm), this work extends multimodal luminescence to the excitation of X&#8208;ray. Besides the flexible excitation sources, this material also shows the exceptional luminescence performance, in which the X&#8208;ray detection limit reaches the level of nGy s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, indicating a great potential for further application as a colorless pigment in the anti&#8208;counterfeiting field. More importantly, the obtained double perovskite features high stability against both humidity and temperature up to 400&#160;&#176;C. This integrated multifunctional luminescent material provides a new directional solution for the development of multifunctional optical materials and devices.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Recent Progress in Nanolaser Technology</title>
      <dc:description>
Recent progress of five representative nanolasers, including photonic crystal lasers, plasmonic lasers, parity&#8211;time symmetry lasers, photonic topological insulator lasers, and bound states in the continuum lasers, is reviewed in terms of their operational principles, optical properties, and practical applications. The future perspectives and challenges of these nanolasers are also discussed.








Abstract
Nanolasers are key elements in the implementation of optical integrated circuits owing to their low lasing thresholds, high energy efficiencies, and high modulation speeds. With the development of semiconductor wafer growth and nanofabrication techniques, various types of wavelength&#8208;scale and subwavelength&#8208;scale nanolasers have been proposed. For example, photonic crystal lasers and plasmonic lasers based on the feedback mechanisms of the photonic bandgap and surface plasmon polaritons, respectively, have been successfully demonstrated. More recently, nanolasers employing new mechanisms of light confinement, including parity&#8211;time symmetry lasers, photonic topological insulator lasers, and bound states in the continuum lasers, have been developed. Here, the operational mechanisms, optical characterizations, and practical applications of these nanolasers based on recent research results are outlined. Their scientific and engineering challenges are also discussed.

      <title>An Adhesive Hydrogel with &#8220;Load&#8208;Sharing&#8221; Effect as Tissue Bandages for Drug and Cell Delivery</title>
      <dc:description>
An adhesive hydrogel based on a &#8220;load&#8208;sharing&#8221; effect of triple hydrogen bonding clusters is reported. To demonstrate their potential applications, these adhesive hydrogels are engineered into internally applied tissue bandages for delivery of either antitumor drugs directly to the tumor site or insulin&#8208;producing cells to treat type 1 diabetes.








Abstract
Hydrogels with adhesive properties have potential for numerous biomedical applications. Here, the design of a novel, intrinsically adhesive hydrogel and its use in developing internal therapeutic bandages is reported. The design involves incorporation of &#8220;triple hydrogen bonding clusters&#8221; (THBCs) as side groups into the hydrogel matrix. The THBC through a unique &#8220;load sharing&#8221; effect and an increase in bond density results in strong adhesions of the hydrogel to a range of surfaces, including glass, plastic, wood, poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE), stainless steel, and biological tissues, even without any chemical reaction. Using the adhesive hydrogel, tissue&#8208;adhesive bandages are developed for either targeted and sustained release of chemotherapeutic nanodrug for liver cancer treatment, or anchored delivery of pancreatic islets for a potential type 1 diabetes (T1D) cell replacement therapy. Stable adhesion of the bandage inside the body enables almost complete tumor suppression in an orthotopic liver cancer mouse model and &#8776;1 month diabetes correction in chemically induced diabetic mice.

      <title>Colorectal Tumor Microenvironment&#8208;Activated Bio&#8208;Decomposable and Metabolizable Cu2O@CaCO3 Nanocomposites for Synergistic Oncotherapy</title>
      <dc:description>
Bio&#8208;decomposable Cu2O@CaCO3 nanocomposites with pH&#8208;responsive CaCO3 shell and H2S&#8208;responsive Cu2O core can be triggered &#8220;on&#8221; into the therapeutic mode by the colorectal tumor environment (TME). The loss of protection from CaCO3 in the acidic TME exposes Cu2O to be sulfuretted by endogenous H2S to form metabolizable Cu31S16 nanocrystals. The Cu2O@CaCO3 can realize TME&#8208;triggered photothermal/photodynamic/chemodynamic/calcium&#8208;overload&#8208;mediated/immune synergistic colorectal oncotherapy.








Abstract
Rational design of tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;activated nanocomposites provides an innovative strategy to construct responsive oncotherapy. In colorectal cancer (CRC), the specific physiological features are the overexpressed endogenous H2S and slightly acidic microenvironment. Here, a core&#8211;shell Cu2O@CaCO3 nanostructure for CRC &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; therapy is reported. With CaCO3 responsive to pH decomposition and Cu2O responsive to H2S sulfuration, Cu2O@CaCO3 can be triggered &#8220;on&#8221; into the therapeutic mode by the colorectal TME. When the CaCO3 shell decomposes and releases calcium in acidic colorectal TME, the loss of protection from the CaCO3 shell exposes the Cu2O core to be sulfuretted by H2S to form metabolizable Cu31S16 nanocrystals that gain remarkably strong near&#8208;infrared absorption. After modifying hyaluronic acid, Cu2O@CaCO3 can achieve synergistic CRC&#8208;targeted and TME&#8208;triggered photothermal/photodynamic/chemodynamic/calcium&#8208;overload&#8208;mediated therapy. Moreover, it is found that the generation of hyperthermia and oxidative stress from Cu2O@CaCO3 nanocomposites can efficiently reprogram the macrophages from the M2&#160;phenotype to the M1 phenotype and initiate a vaccine&#8208;like immune effect after primary tumor removal, which further induces an immune&#8208;favorable TME and intense immune responses for anti&#8208;CD47 antibody to simultaneously inhibit CRC distant metastasis and recurrence by immunotherapy.

      <title>HOMO&#8211;HOMO Electron Transfer: An Elegant Strategy for p&#8208;Type Doping of Polymer Semiconductors toward Thermoelectric Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
A paradigm shift in the doping strategy of p&#8208;type conjugated polymers is proposed by using another p&#8208;type material having partly filled HOMO level instead of an acceptor molecule with low&#8208;lying LUMO value. This strategy results in extraordinary thermally and environmentally stable doped semiconductor systems with high electrical conductivity suitable for thermoelectric applications.








Abstract
Unlike the conventional p&#8208;doping of organic semiconductors (OSCs) using acceptors, here, an efficient doping concept for diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;based polymer PDPP[T]2&#8208;EDOT (OSC&#8208;1) is presented using an oxidized p&#8208;type semiconductor, Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD(TFSI)2 (OSC&#8208;2), exploiting electron transfer from HOMOOSC&#8208;1 to HOMOOSC&#8208;2. A shift of work function toward the HOMOOSC&#8208;1 upon doping is confirmed by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). Detailed X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and UV&#8211;vis&#8211;NIR absorption studies confirm HOMOOSC&#8208;1 to HOMOOSC&#8208;2 electron transfer. The reduction products of Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD(TFSI)2 to Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD(TFSI) and Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD is also confirmed and their relative amounts in doped samples is determined. Mott&#8211;Schottky analysis shows two orders of magnitude increase in free charge carrier density and one order of magnitude increase in the charge carrier mobility. The conductivity increases considerably by four orders of magnitude to a maximum of 10&#160;S&#160;m&#8722;1 for a very low doping ratio of 8 mol%. The doped polymer films exhibit high thermal and ambient stability resulting in a maximum power factor of 0.07&#160;&#181;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;2 at a Seebeck coefficient of 140 &#181;V K&#8722;1 for a very low doping ratio of 4 mol%. Also, the concept of HOMOOSC&#8208;1 to HOMOOSC&#8208;2 electron transfer is a highly efficient, stable and generic way to p&#8208;dope other conjugated polymers.

The doped polymer films exhibit high thermal and ambient stability resulting in a maximum power factor of 0.07&#160;&lt;b&gt;&#181;&lt;/b&gt;W&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at a Seebeck coefficient of 140 &lt;b&gt;&#181;&lt;/b&gt;V K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for a very low doping ratio of 4 mol%. Also, the concept of HOMO&lt;sub&gt;OSC&#8208;1&lt;/sub&gt; to HOMO&lt;sub&gt;OSC&#8208;2&lt;/sub&gt; electron transfer is a highly efficient, stable and generic way to p&#8208;dope other conjugated polymers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Converting 2D Nanofiber Membranes to 3D Hierarchical Assemblies with Structural and Compositional Gradients Regulates Cell Behavior</title>
      <dc:description>
A new class of 3D nanofiber assemblies with structural and compositional gradients is developed based on electrospinning, gas&#8208;foaming expansion, coating, diffusion, encapsulation, and crosslinking. Such assemblies with gradients in pore sizes, fiber organizations, and contents of signaling molecules can be used to engineer tissue constructs for tissue repair and build biomimetic disease models for studying disease biology and screening drugs.








Abstract
New methods are described for converting 2D electrospun nanofiber membranes to 3D hierarchical assemblies with structural and compositional gradients. Pore&#8208;size gradients are generated by tuning the expansion of 2D membranes in different layers with incorporation of various amounts of a surfactant during the gas&#8208;foaming process. The gradient in fiber organizations is formed by expanding 2D nanofiber membranes composed of multiple regions collected by varying rotating speeds of mandrel. A compositional gradient on 3D assemblies consisting of radially aligned nanofibers is prepared by dripping, diffusion, and crosslinking. Bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) on the 3D nanofiber assemblies with smaller pore size show significantly higher expression of hypoxia&#8208;related markers and enhanced chondrogenic differentiation compared to BMSCs cultured on the assemblies with larger pore size. The basic fibroblast growth factor gradient can accelerate fibroblast migration from the surrounding area to the center in an in vitro wound healing model. Taken together, 3D&#160;nanofiber assemblies with gradients in pore sizes, fiber organizations, and contents of signaling molecules can be used to engineer tissue constructs for tissue repair and build biomimetic disease models for studying disease biology and screening drugs, in particular, for interface tissue engineering and modeling.

      <title>Graphene Nanoribbons: On&#8208;Surface Synthesis and Integration into Electronic Devices</title>
      <dc:description>
Precision synthesis of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) with chemically defined structures is crucial for their fundamental studies as well as device applications. The recent progress in the surface&#8208;assisted synthesis of GNRs under ultrahigh vacuum and chemical vapor deposition conditions is summarized, and the updates in the applications of on&#8208;surface synthesized GNRs, especially directing toward transistor devices, are subsequently addressed.








Abstract
Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) are quasi&#8208;1D graphene strips, which have attracted attention as a novel class of semiconducting materials for various applications in electronics and optoelectronics. GNRs exhibit unique electronic and optical properties, which sensitively depend on their chemical structures, especially the width and edge configuration. Therefore, precision synthesis of GNRs with chemically defined structures is crucial for their fundamental studies as well as device applications. In contrast to top&#8208;down methods, bottom&#8208;up chemical synthesis using tailor&#8208;made molecular precursors can achieve atomically precise GNRs. Here, the synthesis of GNRs on metal surfaces under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) conditions is the main focus, and the recent progress in the field is summarized. The UHV method leads to successful unambiguous visualization of atomically precise structures of various GNRs with different edge configurations. The CVD protocol, in contrast, achieves simpler and industry&#8208;viable fabrication of GNRs, allowing for the scale up and efficient integration of the as&#8208;grown GNRs into devices. The recent updates in device studies are also addressed using GNRs synthesized by both the UHV method and CVD, mainly for transistor applications. Furthermore, views on the next steps and challenges in the field of on&#8208;surface synthesized GNRs are provided.

      <title>Understanding Plant Biomass via Computational Modeling</title>
      <dc:description>
The hierarchical structures and properties of plant biomass (especially wood) and relevant computational modeling are reviewed, which may inspire the bottom&#8208;up design of new bio&#8208;based materials and the manufacturing of nanomaterials from plant biomass. Both modeling and relevant experimental studies of wood cell wall, cellulose, lignin, and their molecular units are summarized. Common hierarchical structures in nature are also compared with wood.








Abstract
Plant biomass, especially wood, has been used for structural materials since ancient times. It is also showing great potential for new structural materials and it is the major feedstock for the emerging biorefineries for building a sustainable society. The plant cell wall is a hierarchical matrix of mainly cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. Herein, the structure, properties, and reactions of cellulose, lignin, and wood cell walls, studied using density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD), which are the widely used computational modeling approaches, are reviewed. Computational modeling, which has played a crucial role in understanding the structure and properties of plant biomass and its nanomaterials, may serve a leading role on developing new hierarchical materials from biomass in the future.

      <title>Precise Control of Perovskite Crystallization Kinetics via Sequential A&#8208;Site Doping</title>
      <dc:description>
The whole crystallization pathways and mechanism of two&#8208;step fabricated perovskites are unveiled by in situ grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering measurements and density functional theory calculations. Sequential A&#8208;site doping of Cs+ and GA+ is found to alter the crystallization kinetics and improves the perovskite film morphology, giving rise to device efficiency as high as 23.5%.








Abstract
Two&#8208;step&#8208;fabricated FAPbI3&#8208;based perovskites have attracted increasing attention because of their excellent film quality and reproducibility. However, the underlying film formation mechanism remains mysterious. Here, the crystallization kinetics of a benchmark FAPbI3&#8208;based perovskite film with sequential A&#8208;site doping of Cs+ and GA+ is revealed by in situ X&#8208;ray scattering and first&#8208;principles calculations. Incorporating Cs+ in the first step induces an alternative pathway from &#948;&#8208;CsPbI3 to perovskite &#945;&#8208;phase, which is energetically more favorable than the conventional pathways from PbI2. However, pinholes are formed due to the nonuniform nucleation with sparse &#948;&#8208;CsPbI3 crystals. Fortunately, incorporating GA+ in the second step can not only promote the phase transition from &#948;&#8208;CsPbI3 to the perovskite &#945;&#8208;phase, but also eliminate pinholes via Ostwald ripening and enhanced grain boundary migration, thus boosting efficiencies of perovskite solar cells over 23%. This work demonstrates the unprecedented advantage of the two&#8208;step process over the one&#8208;step process, allowing a precise control of the perovskite crystallization kinetics by decoupling the crystal nucleation and growth process.

      <title>Monolithic Organic/Colloidal Quantum Dot Hybrid Tandem Solar Cells via Buffer Engineering</title>
      <dc:description>
A monolithic organic/colloidal quantum dots hybrid tandem solar cell (TSC) is developed by introducing dual near&#8208;infrared absorbers. In addition, the interconnecting layer is engineered to use an organic subcell as a front cell to increase the matching current. Therefore, the hybrid TSC shows the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.7% among the previously reported monolithic PbS colloidal quantum dot (CQD)&#8208;based hybrid TSCs.








Abstract
Monolithically integrated hybrid tandem solar cells (TSCs) that combine solution&#8208;processed colloidal quantum dot (CQD) and organic molecules are a promising device architecture, able to complement the absorption across the visible to the infrared. However, the performance of organic/CQD hybrid TSCs has not yet surpassed that of single&#8208;junction CQD solar cells. Here, a strategic optical structure is devised to overcome the prior performance limit of hybrid TSCs by employing a multibuffer layer and a dual near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorber. In particular, a multibuffer layer is introduced to solve the problem of the CQD solvent penetrating the underlying organic layer. In addition, the matching current of monolithic TSCs is significantly improved to 15.2 mA cm&#8722;2 by using a dual NIR organic absorber that complements the absorption of CQD. The hybrid TSCs reach a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.7%, higher than that of the corresponding individual single&#8208;junction cells, representing the highest efficiency reported to date for CQD&#8208;based hybrid TSCs.

      <title>High&#8208;Throughput Growth of Wafer&#8208;Scale Monolayer Transition Metal Dichalcogenide via Vertical Ostwald Ripening</title>
      <dc:description>
High&#8208;throughput growth of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is developed on 6&#8208;inch wafer scale. Periodically interrupting the precursor supply drives lateral growth via the surface diffusion of adatoms on the pre&#8208;synthesized TMDs (vertical Ostwald ripening). The as&#8208;grown TMD possesses high crystallinity with well&#8208;stitched grains, and uniform electrical properties even after transfer by an etching&#8208;free de&#8208;bonding and bonding process.








Abstract
For practical device applications, monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) films must meet key industry needs for batch processing, including the high&#8208;throughput, large&#8208;scale production of high&#8208;quality, spatially uniform materials, and reliable integration into devices. Here, high&#8208;throughput growth, completed in 12 min, of 6&#8208;inch wafer&#8208;scale monolayer MoS2 and WS2 is reported, which is directly compatible with scalable batch processing and device integration. Specifically, a pulsed metal&#8211;organic chemical vapor deposition process is developed, where periodic interruption of the precursor supply drives vertical Ostwald ripening, which prevents secondary nucleation despite high precursor concentrations. The as&#8208;grown TMD films show excellent spatial homogeneity and well&#8208;stitched grain boundaries, enabling facile transfer to various target substrates without degradation. Using these films, batch fabrication of high&#8208;performance field&#8208;effect transistor (FET) arrays in wafer&#8208;scale is demonstrated, and the FETs show remarkable uniformity. The high&#8208;throughput production and wafer&#8208;scale automatable transfer will facilitate the integration of TMDs into Si&#8208;complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor platforms.

      <title>Nanoconfined Water&#8208;Molecule Channels for High&#8208;Yield Solar Vapor Generation under Weaker Sunlight</title>
      <dc:description>
Hydrophobic nanoconfined water&#8208;molecule channels are demonstrated to reduce water vaporization enthalpy in solar vapor generation (SVG) using both experimental methods and theoretical simulations. Under 0.5 sun irradiation, this designed evaporator achieves the record SVG rate of 1.25&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1. Furthermore, the evaporator can be applied in the water&#8208;purification process with high vapor yields.








Abstract
Solar vapor generation is a promising method to efficiently produce fresh water. However, the insufficient vapor yields under natural daylight restrict its practical applications, and the basic evaporation mechanisms are deficient for reasonable design of evaporator structure. Here, hydrophobic nano&#8208;confined water molecule channels (NCWMCs) are demonstrated, which can reduce the vaporization enthalpy for water evaporation and achieve a record vapor generation rate of 1.25&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 under 0.5 sun irradiation. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal the cluster&#8208;evaporation process in the NCWMC system. As a result, the evaporator with NCWMC system can effectively purify seawater and wastewater samples using this environmentally friendly strategy.

      <title>Coexisting Single&#8208;Atomic Fe and Ni Sites on Hierarchically Ordered Porous Carbon as a Highly Efficient ORR Electrocatalyst</title>
      <dc:description>
A hetero&#8208;single&#8208;atom oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalyst having atomically dispersed Fe and Ni coanchored to a microsized nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon support with unique trimodal&#8208;porous structure configured by ordered macropores interconnected through mesopores is presented. The achieved outstanding ORR performance results from the synergetic enhancement induced by the coexisting Fe&#63743;N4 and Ni&#63743;N4 sites, and the superior mass&#8208;transfer capability.








Abstract
The development of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts based on earth&#8208;abundant nonprecious materials is critically important for sustainable large&#8208;scale applications of fuel cells and metal&#8211;air batteries. Herein, a hetero&#8208;single&#8208;atom (h&#8208;SA) ORR electrocatalyst is presented, which has atomically dispersed Fe and Ni coanchored to a microsized nitrogen&#8208;doped graphitic carbon support with unique trimodal&#8208;porous structure configured by highly ordered macropores interconnected through mesopores. Extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectra confirm that Fe&#8208; and Ni&#8208;SAs are affixed to the carbon support via Fe&#63743;N4 and Ni&#63743;N4 coordination bonds. The resultant Fe/Ni h&#8208;SA electrocatalyst exhibits an outstanding ORR activity, outperforming SA electrocatalysts with only Fe&#8208; or Ni&#8208;SAs, and the benchmark Pt/C. The obtained experimental results indicate that the achieved outstanding ORR performance results from the synergetic enhancement induced by the coexisting Fe&#63743;N4 and Ni&#63743;N4 sites, and the superior mass&#8208;transfer capability promoted by the trimodal&#8208;porous&#8208;structured carbon support.

      <title>Bioinspired Adhesion: Multiple Mechanical Gradients are Responsible for the Strong Adhesion of Spider Attachment Hair (Adv. Mater. 37/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
Nanostructured adhesive hairs on the feet of spiders are responsible for strong adhesion, enabling the animals to walk vertically and upside down. In article number 2002758, Clemens F. Schaber, Martin M&#252;ller, and co&#8208;workers use scanning nanofocus X&#8208;ray scattering under force control to elucidate the mechanism of alignment and consequently strong attachment of the nanostructures to a glass surface. The spider attachment system is a promising model for the development of powerful residue&#8208;free dry adhesives.

      <dc:description>
Similar to placing a carpet on a staircase, terraced graphene is formed by stacking a layer of graphene on an atomically terraced substrate. This leads to topographic corrugations and charge puddles in the terraced graphene. In the presence of a magnetic field, its resistance can change as high as 5000% at room temperature, paving a route for extremely sensitive and high&#8208;resolution magnetic sensors, as revealed by Ariando Ariando and co&#8208;workers in article number 2002201.

      <title>Electrical Dynamic Switching of Magnetic Plasmon Resonance Based on Selective Lithium Deposition</title>
      <dc:description>
The first self&#8208;powered electrical dynamic switching of magnetic plasmon resonance (MPR) based on lithium deposition in a lithium metal battery is performed. With the precisely designed silver&#8208;based metal&#8211;insulator&#8211;metal (MIM) structure, dynamic optical switching between MPR and surface plasmon polariton excitations is realized via an electrochemical charging and discharging process, leading to a reconfigurable structure transformation from discontinuous MIM to semi&#8208;infinite metallic grating.








Abstract
Active plasmonic nanostructures have garnered considerable interest in physics, chemistry, and material science due to the dynamically switchable capability of plasmonic responses. Here, the first electrically dynamic control of magnetic plasmon resonance (MPR) through structure transformation by selective deposition of lithium on a metal&#8211;insulator&#8211;metal (MIM) structure is reported. Distinct optical switching between MPR and surface plasmon polariton (SPP) excitations can be enabled by applying a proper electrical current to the electrochemical cell. Furthermore, the structure transformation through lithium metal deposition indicates the reconfigurable MPR excitation in a full cycling of the charging and discharging process. The results may shed light on electrically compatible self&#8208;powered active plasmonics as well as nondestructive optical sensing for electrochemical evolution.

      <title>Metal&#8208;Free Halide Perovskite Single Crystals with Very Long Charge Lifetimes for Efficient X&#8208;ray Imaging</title>
      <dc:description>
A large size single&#8208;crystal metal&#8208;free perovskite DABCO&#8208;NH4Br3 is grown. The crystal exhibits a large semigap of &#8776;16 eV and an extremely long lifetime approaching the millisecond regime, which enables high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray response and imaging with sensitivity up to 173 &#956;C Gyair&#8722;1.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;free halide perovskites, as a specific category of the perovskite family, have recently emerged as novel semiconductors for organic ferroelectrics and promise the wide chemical diversity of the ABX3 perovskite structure with mechanical flexibility, light weight, and eco&#8208;friendly processing. However, after the initial discovery 17 years ago, there has been no experimental information about their charge transport properties and only one brief mention of their optoelectronic properties. Here, growth of large single crystals of metal&#8208;free halide perovskite DABCO&#8208;NH4Br3 (DABCO = N&#8208;N&#8242;&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octonium) is reported together with characterization of their instrinsic optical and electronic properties and demonstration, of metal&#8208;free halide perovskite optoelectronics. The results reveal that the crystals have an unusually large semigap of &#8776;16 eV and a specific band nature with the valence band maximum and the conduction band minimum mainly dominated by the halide and DABCO2+, respectively. The unusually large semigap rationalizes extremely long lifetimes approaching the millisecond regime, leading to very high charge diffusion lengths (tens of &#181;m). The crystals also exhibit high X&#8208;ray attenuation as well as being lightweight. All these properties translate to high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray imaging with sensitivity up to 173 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2. This makes metal&#8208;free perovskites novel candidates for the next generation of optoelectronics.

      <title>500 Wh kg&#8722;1 Class Li Metal Battery Enabled by a Self&#8208;Organized Core&#8211;Shell Composite Anode</title>
      <dc:description>
A self&#8208;organized core&#8211;shell composite anode, which contains an outer sheath of lithiated liquid metal and an inner layer of Li metal, is reported. Benefiting from the composite anode that prevents the dendrite formation and eliminates the use of copper as substrates, full cells that pair the composite anode with a commercially available cathode deliver ultrahigh energy density exceeding 500 Wh kg&#8722;1.








Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal offers the highest projected energy density as a battery anode, however its extremely high reactivity induces dendrite growth and dead Li formation during repeated charge/discharge processes, resulting in both poor reversibility and catastrophic failure. Approaches reported to date often seek to suppress dendrites formation at the expense of energy density. Here, a strategy that resolves the above conflict and achieves a dendrite&#8208;free and long&#8208;term reversible Li metal anode is reported. A self&#8208;organized core&#8211;shell composite anode, comprising an outer sheath of lithiated liquid metal (LixLMy) and an inner layer of Li metal, is developed, which posesses high electrical and ionic conductivity, and physically separates Li from the electrolyte. The introduction of LixLMy not only prevents dendrite formation, but also eliminates the use of copper as an inert substrate. Full cells made of such composite anodes and commercially available LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 (NCM622) cathodes deliver ultrahigh energy density of 1500 Wh L&#8722;1 and 483 Wh kg&#8722;1. The high capacity can be maintained for more than 500 cycles, with fading rate of less than 0.05% per cycle. Pairing with LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) further raises the energy density to 1732 Wh L&#8722;1 and 514 Wh kg&#8722;1.

     alt="500 Wh kg&#8722;1 Class Li Metal Battery Enabled by a Self&#8208;Organized Core&#8211;Shell Composite Anode"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A self&#8208;organized core&#8211;shell composite anode, which contains an outer sheath of lithiated liquid metal and an inner layer of Li metal, is reported. Benefiting from the composite anode that prevents the dendrite formation and eliminates the use of copper as substrates, full cells that pair the composite anode with a commercially available cathode deliver ultrahigh energy density exceeding 500 Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithium (Li) metal offers the highest projected energy density as a battery anode, however its extremely high reactivity induces dendrite growth and dead Li formation during repeated charge/discharge processes, resulting in both poor reversibility and catastrophic failure. Approaches reported to date often seek to suppress dendrites formation at the expense of energy density. Here, a strategy that resolves the above conflict and achieves a dendrite&#8208;free and long&#8208;term reversible Li metal anode is reported. A self&#8208;organized core&#8211;shell composite anode, comprising an outer sheath of lithiated liquid metal (Li&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;LM&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;) and an inner layer of Li metal, is developed, which posesses high electrical and ionic conductivity, and physically separates Li from the electrolyte. The introduction of Li&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;LM&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; not only prevents dendrite formation, but also eliminates the use of copper as an inert substrate. Full cells made of such composite anodes and commercially available LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.6&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (NCM&lt;sub&gt;622&lt;/sub&gt;) cathodes deliver ultrahigh energy density of 1500 Wh L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 483 Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The high capacity can be maintained for more than 500 cycles, with fading rate of less than 0.05% per cycle. Pairing with LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (NCM&lt;sub&gt;811&lt;/sub&gt;) further raises the energy density to 1732 Wh L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 514 Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rashba Effect in Functional Spintronic Devices</title>
      <dc:description>
The Rashba effect provides fascinating functionality for electronic devices because of the electric modulation of spin orientation. This work focuses on semiconductor spin transistors and spin&#8211;orbit torque devices. Recent theories and experiments related to generating and controlling spin current are presented. Future directions in the development of spin logic and memory devices are also discussed.








Abstract
Exploiting spin transport increases the functionality of electronic devices and enables such devices to overcome physical limitations related to speed and power. Utilizing the Rashba effect at the interface of heterostructures provides promising opportunities toward the development of high&#8208;performance devices because it enables electrical control of the spin information. Herein, the focus is mainly on progress related to the two most compelling devices that exploit the Rashba effect: spin transistors and spin&#8211;orbit torque devices. For spin field&#8208;effect transistors, the gate&#8208;voltage manipulation of the Rashba effect and subsequent control of the spin precession are discussed, including for all&#8208;electric spin field&#8208;effect transistors. For spin&#8211;orbit torque devices, recent theories and experiments on interface&#8208;generated spin current are discussed. The future directions of manipulating the Rashba effect to realize fully integrated spin logic and memory devices are also discussed.

      <title>Rational Design of Semiconductor&#8208;Based Chemiresistors and their Libraries for Next&#8208;Generation Artificial Olfaction</title>
      <dc:description>
A variety of material design strategies are investigated for the realization of next&#8208;generation artificial olfaction. Inspired by the mammalian olfactory system, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electronic noses will have diverse material libraries coupled with advanced signal processors that can replace and/or surpass the human olfactory system. These electronic noses are expected to be applicable to numerous on&#8208;demand application fields.








Abstract
Artificial olfaction based on gas sensor arrays aims to substitute for, support, and surpass human olfaction. Like mammalian olfaction, a larger number of sensors and more signal processing are crucial for strengthening artificial olfaction. Due to rapid progress in computing capabilities and machine&#8208;learning algorithms, on&#8208;demand high&#8208;performance artificial olfaction that can eclipse human olfaction becomes inevitable once diverse and versatile gas sensing materials are provided. Here, rational strategies to design a myriad of different semiconductor&#8208;based chemiresistors and to grow gas sensing libraries enough to identify a wide range of odors and gases are reviewed, discussed, and suggested. Key approaches include the use of p&#8208;type oxide semiconductors, multinary perovskite and spinel oxides, carbon&#8208;based materials, metal chalcogenides, their heterostructures, as well as heterocomposites as distinctive sensing materials, the utilization of bilayer sensor design, the design of robust sensing materials, and the high&#8208;throughput screening of sensing materials. In addition, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art and key issues in the implementation of electronic noses are discussed. Finally, a perspective on chemiresistive sensing materials for next&#8208;generation artificial olfaction is provided.

These features can contribute to reducing e&#8208;waste, ensuring device integrity and performance, enabling the device to self&#8208;charge, displaying the charge status, and maintaining the performance under a wide range of temperatures.








Abstract
With the miniaturization of personal wearable electronics, considerable effort has been expended to develop high&#8208;performance flexible/stretchable energy storage devices for powering integrated active devices. Supercapacitors can fulfill this role owing to their simple structures, high power density, and cyclic stability.

Artificial skin perception that integrates the perception functionality into a flexible and stretchable sensing system could endow current flexible electronic devices with higher intelligence. The recent progress, challenges, and perspects of artificial skin perception are discussed, offering some inspiration for the development of next&#8208;generation intelligent systems, especially soft robotics.








Abstract
Skin is the largest organ, with the functionalities of protection, regulation, and sensation. The emulation of human skin via flexible and stretchable electronics gives rise to electronic skin (e&#8208;skin), which has realized artificial sensation and other functions that cannot be achieved by conventional electronics. To date, tremendous progress has been made in data acquisition and transmission for e&#8208;skin systems, while the implementation of perception within systems, that is, sensory data processing, is still in its infancy. Integrating the perception functionality into a flexible and stretchable sensing system, namely artificial skin perception, is critical to endow current e&#8208;skin systems with higher intelligence. Here, recent progress in the design and fabrication of artificial skin perception devices and systems is summarized, and challenges and prospects are discussed. The strategies for implementing artificial skin perception utilize either conventional silicon&#8208;based circuits or novel flexible computing devices such as memristive devices and synaptic transistors, which enable artificial skin to surpass human skin, with a distributed, low&#8208;latency, and energy&#8208;efficient information&#8208;processing ability. In future, artificial skin perception would be a new enabling technology to construct next&#8208;generation intelligent electronic devices and systems for advanced applications, such as robotic surgery, rehabilitation, and prosthetics.

      <title>Crystalline Porous Organic Salts: From Micropore to Hierarchical Pores</title>
      <dc:description>
An overview of recent achievements in the synthetic approaches, structural features, and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art applications of crystalline porous organic salts (CPOSs) and a perspective on the construction of the porous hierarchy within the CPOS frameworks are described.








Abstract
Crystalline porous organic salts (CPOSs), as an emerging class of porous organic materials, combining the uniform microporous system and distinct polarized channels, have become a highly evolving field of important current interest. The unique ionic bond of a CPOS endows the confined channels with high polarity, making CPOSs distinct from other organic frameworks. CPOSs show many fascinating properties, such as proton conductivity and fast transport of polar molecules, which involve the interaction between highly polarized guest molecules and host frameworks. Substantial progress has been made in the synthesis and applications of CPOSs. Herein, an overview is provided to impart a comprehensive understanding of the link between the synthetic approaches and the resultant microporous structure, the structure&#8211;function correlation and the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art applications of CPOSs. The enhanced mass&#8208;transport performance of hierarchically porous structure in combination with the intrinsic polarized channels of CPOSs is very promising to create new applications and contribute to a new research upsurge. The perspective to construct porous hierarchy within the crystalline porous organic salts is assessed and will open a new research avenue. In the conclusion, the current challenges on the synthesis, structural regulation, and applications of CPOSs and the future of hierarchically porous crystalline organic salts are discussed.

      <title>Strain&#8208;Sensitive Magnetization Reversal of a van der Waals Magnet</title>
      <dc:description>
An ultrasensitive magnetization reversal in the van der Waals magnet Fe3GeTe2 is realized by strain. Remarkably increased coercive field, Curie temperature, and transition temperature between single&#8208; and labyrinthine&#8208;domain states under tensile strain are also observed. The strain&#8208;tunable magnetism could result from the sensitive change of magnetic anisotropy energy with the theoretical results.








Abstract
By virtue of the layered structure, van der Waals (vdW) magnets are sensitive to the lattice deformation controlled by the external strain, providing an ideal platform to explore the one&#8208;step magnetization reversal that is still conceptual in conventional magnets due to the limited strain&#8208;tuning range of the coercive field. In this study, a uniaxial tensile strain is applied to thin flakes of the vdW magnet Fe3GeTe2 (FGT), and a dramatic increase of the coercive field (Hc) by more than 150% with an applied strain of 0.32% is observed. Moreover, the change of the transition temperatures between the different magnetic phases under strain is investigated, and the phase diagram of FGT in the strain&#8211;temperature plane is obtained. Comparing the phase diagram with theoretical results, the strain&#8208;tunable magnetism is attributed to the sensitive change of magnetic anisotropy energy. Remarkably, strain allows an ultrasensitive magnetization reversal to be achieved, which may promote the development of novel straintronic device applications.

      <title>A Review on Micro/Nanoforming to Fabricate 3D Metallic Structures</title>
      <dc:description>
A systematic review on micro/nanoforming processes for the fabrication of 3D metallic structures with multifunctional properties is presented. The latest advances in achieving such microbulk forming, microsheet forming, energy&#8208;field microforming processes, 3D nanoprinting, and nanoforming with remarkably innovative methods are described.








Abstract
With the rapid development of micro&#8208;electromechanical systems (MEMS), micro/nanoscale fabrication of 3D metallic structures with complex structures and multifunctions is becoming more and more important due to the recent trend of product miniaturization. As a promising micromanufacturing approach based on plastic deformation, micro/nanoforming shows the attractive advantages of high productivity, low cost, near&#8208;net&#8208;shape, and excellent mechanical properties, compared with other non&#8208;silicon&#8208;based micromanufacturing technologies. However, micro/nanoforming is far less established due to the so&#8208;called size effects in terms of materials models, process laws, tooling design, etc. The understanding of basic issues on micro/nanoforming is not yet mature, and it is currently a topic of rigorous investigation. Here, a systematic review on the micro/nanoforming processes of 3D structures with multifunctional properties is presented, wherein also a critical examination of the interplay between relevant length scales and size effects affecting the structural integrity of micro/mesoscale metallic systems is also provided. Finally, the challenges of micro/nanoscale fabrication are proposed, including the development trends of new micro/nanoforming processes, multiple field coupling effects, and theoretical modeling at the trans&#8208;scale.

      <title>Pillar[n]arene&#8208;Based Supramolecular Switches in Solution and on Surfaces</title>
      <dc:description>
The supramolecular switches based on pillar[n]arene derivatives that have been investigated in solution and further shifted to the solid surfaces of materials for collective amplified motions controlled by actuations are reviewed. The afforded materials present combined features of stimuli&#8208;responsiveness of pillar[n]arene&#8208;based switches and intrinsic properties of solid supports and show applications in various aspects.








Abstract
The design and synthesis of new synthetic macrocycles has driven the rapid development of supramolecular chemistry and materials. Pillar[n]arenes, as a new type of macrocyclic compounds, are used as a promising type of building blocks for switchable supramolecular systems due to their versatile functionalization and the ability of binding toward various guest molecules. A number of guests can form inclusion complexes with pillar[n]arenes and their derivatives in solution, which are sensitive to different external triggers. Interestingly, the pursuit of complex stimuli&#8208;responsive functional materials and devices has largely motivated the shift of pillar[n]arene&#8208;based switches from solution media to surfaces for controllable macroscopic motions on solid platforms. Facilitated by the facile modification of pillar[n]arenes on various solid supports and the dynamic binding of host&#8211;guest complexes, numerous functional hybrid materials with adjustable physical or chemical properties and integrated functionalities have been reported in the last decade. Here, the advance of supramolecular switches in solution and on surfaces based on pillar[n]arenes and derivatives with an emphasis on the efforts and the latest contributions from the field is discussed.

      <title>The Key Role of Intrinsic Lifetime Dynamics from Upconverting Nanosystems in Multiemission Particle Velocimetry</title>
      <dc:description>
Multiemission particle velocimetry exploits the intrinsic luminescence dynamics of different lanthanide ions in core&#8211;shell upconverting nanoparticles. These nanoprobes show sequential emissions within known time intervals, providing simultaneous measurements of time and distance of flowing particles with a single probe. This new method results in great accuracy and improved flexibility in the determination of flow velocities compared to previously established methods.








Abstract
Evaluation of particle dynamics at the nano&#8208; and microscale poses a challenge to the development of novel velocimetry techniques. Established optical methods implement external or internal calibrations of the emission profiles by varying the particle velocity and are limited to specific experimental conditions. The proposed multiemission particle velocimetry approach aims to introduce a new concept for a luminescent probe, which guarantees accurate velocity measurements at the microscale, independent of the particle concentration or experimental setup, and without need for calibration. The simplicity of these analyses relies on the intrinsic luminescence dynamics of core&#8211;shell upconverting nanoparticles. Upon excitation with a focused near&#8208;infrared pulsed laser, the nanoparticle emits photons at different wavelengths. The time interval between emissions from different excited states is independent of the local environment or particle velocity. The velocity of the particles is calculated by measuring the distance between the maxima of two different emissions and dividing it by the known difference in luminescence lifetimes. This method is demonstrated using simple digital imaging of nanoparticles flowing in 75&#8211;150 &#181;m diameter capillaries. Using this novel approach typically results in a relative standard deviation of the experimental velocities of 5% or lower without any calibration.

      <dc:description>
Degeneration of dopaminergic neurons is a most common age&#8208;related disorder in central nervous system. A break&#8208;through idea using electromagnetized nanoparticles to mediate neural plasticity and recover functions of degenerative dopaminergic neurons in midbrain of a Parkinson's disease animal model is conceived.

Abstract
The degeneration of dopaminergic neurons is a major contributor to the pathogenesis of mid&#8208;brain disorders. Clinically, cell therapeutic solutions, by increasing the neurotransmitter dopamine levels in the patients, are hindered by low efficiency and/or side effects. Here, a strategy using electromagnetized nanoparticles to modulate neural plasticity and recover degenerative dopamine neurons in vivo is reported. Remarkably, electromagnetic fields generated by the nanoparticles under ultrasound stimulation modulate intracellular calcium signaling to influence synaptic plasticity and control neural behavior. Dopaminergic neuronal functions are reversed by upregulating the expression tyrosine hydroxylase, thus resulting in ameliorating the neural behavioral disorders in zebrafish. This wireless tool can serve as a viable and safe strategy for the regenerative therapy of the neurodegenerative disorders.

      <dc:description>
In article number 2001736, Luiz E. Bertassoni and co&#8208;workers present the use of lithography&#8208;based 3D printing to fabricate a novel modular microcage scaffold system. These hollow microcages can be stacked in thousands of geometric configurations with the ability to scale in size and shape to fit complex tissue defects. Different growth factors and cells can be placed inside each block, enabling cell&#8208;instructive and accelerated repair of musculoskeletal tissue injuries.

In article number 2002784, Qin Hu, Haiming Zhu, Feng Liu, and co&#8208;workers use in situ grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering techniques to study the crystallization kinetics of 2D perovskites and reveal the role of additives in the crystallization process. The synergy between DMSO and KI additives can improve the crystal orientation and effectively passivate defects, owing to the sandwich&#8208;type distribution of K+, delivering a high efficiency of 16.48%.

      <title>Metasurfaces: Coherent Perfect Diffraction in Metagratings (Adv. Mater. 36/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
Coherent control of metagratings through multiple wave excitations provides new opportunities for highly reconfigurable broadband metasurfaces with large diffraction efficiency, beyond the limitations of conventional approaches. In article number 2002341, Ming Kang, Xueqian Zhang, Alex Krasnok, Jiaguang Han, Andrea Al&#249;, and co&#8208;workers discover that energy distribution between the diffraction orders can be continuously controlled on&#8208;demand by simply changing the relative phase difference between two excitation signals.

In article number &lt;a&gt;https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.2020023412002341&lt;/a&gt;, Ming Kang, Xueqian Zhang, Alex Krasnok, Jiaguang Han, Andrea Al&#249;, and co&#8208;workers discover that energy distribution between the diffraction orders can be continuously controlled on&#8208;demand by simply changing the relative phase difference between two excitation signals.

      <title>TFT Channel Materials for Display Applications: From Amorphous Silicon to Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
      <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance thin&#8208;film&#8208;transistor (TFT) channel materials are essential components in future displays with novel functions and form factors. The basic materials properties and their TFT applications are discussed, focusing mainly on their performance. In addition, other key considerations such as bias&#8208; and light&#8208;stability are also covered.








Abstract
As the need for super&#8208;high&#8208;resolution displays with various form factors has increased, it has become necessary to produce high&#8208;performance thin&#8208;film transistors (TFTs) that enable faster switching and higher current driving of each pixel in the display. Over the past few decades, hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a&#8208;Si:H) has been widely utilized as a TFT channel material. More recently, to meet the requirement of new types of displays such as organic light&#8208;emitting diode displays, and also to overcome the performance and reliability issues of a&#8208;Si:H, low&#8208;temperature polycrystalline silicon and amorphous oxide semiconductors have partly replaced a&#8208;Si:H channel materials. Basic material properties and device structures of TFTs in commercial displays are explored, and then the potential of atomically thin layered transition metal dichalcogenides as next&#8208;generation channel materials is discussed.

      <title>Metamaterials for Enhanced Optical Responses and their Application to Active Control of Terahertz Waves</title>
      <dc:description>
Passive and active metamaterials are important to the development of unconventional terahertz optical devices due to their engineered optical responses, such as enhanced optical responses, electrical control, and spatiotemporal control. These materials are reviewed, with emphasis on metamaterials for engineering of terahertz waves, from the regime of passive devices to broader areas in which functionalized active terahertz devices are particularly required.








Abstract
Metamaterials, artificially constructed structures that mimic lattices in natural materials, have made numerous contributions to the development of unconventional optical devices. With an increasing demand for more diverse functionalities, terahertz (THz) metamaterials are also expanding their domain, from the realm of mere passive devices to the broader area where functionalized active THz devices are particularly required. A brief review on THz metamaterials is given with a focus on research conducted in the authors' group. The first part is centered on enhanced THz optical responses from tightly coupled meta&#8208;atom structures, such as high refractive index, enhanced optical activity, anomalous wavelength scaling, large phase retardation, and nondispersive polarization rotation. Next, electrically gated graphene metamaterials are reviewed with an emphasis on the functionalization of enhanced THz optical responses. Finally, the linear frequency conversion of THz waves in a rapidly time&#8208;variant THz metamaterial is briefly discussed in the more general context of spatiotemporal control of light.

Abstract
One of the key breakthroughs enabling flexible electronics with novel form factors is the deployment of flexible polymer films in place of brittle glass, which is one of the major structural materials for conventional electronic devices. Flexible electronics requires polymer films with the core properties of glass (i.e., dimensional stability and transparency) while retaining the pliability of the polymer, which, however, is fundamentally intractable due to the mutually exclusive nature of these characteristics. An overview of a transparent fiber&#8208;reinforced polymer, which is suggested as a potentially viable structural material for emerging flexible/wearable electronics, is provided. This includes material concept and fabrication and a brief review of recent research progress on its applications over the past decade.

Abstract
Control of magnetization in magnetic nanostructures is essential for development of spintronic devices because it governs fundamental device characteristics such as energy consumption, areal density, and operation speed. In this respect, spin&#8211;orbit torque (SOT), which originates from the spin&#8211;orbit interaction, has been widely investigated due to its efficient manipulation of the magnetization using in&#8208;plane current. SOT spearheads novel spintronic applications including high&#8208;speed magnetic memories, reconfigurable logics, and neuromorphic computing. Herein, recent advances in SOT research, highlighting the considerable benefits and challenges of SOT&#8208;based spintronic devices, are reviewed. First, the materials and structural engineering that enhances SOT efficiency are discussed. Then major experimental results for field&#8208;free SOT switching of perpendicular magnetization are summarized, which includes the introduction of an internal effective magnetic field and the generation of a distinct spin current with out&#8208;of&#8208;plane spin polarization. Finally, advanced SOT functionalities are presented, focusing on the demonstration of reconfigurable and complementary operation in spin logic devices.

In this respect, spin&#8211;orbit torque (SOT), which originates from the spin&#8211;orbit interaction, has been widely investigated due to its efficient manipulation of the magnetization using in&#8208;plane current. SOT spearheads novel spintronic applications including high&#8208;speed magnetic memories, reconfigurable logics, and neuromorphic computing. Herein, recent advances in SOT research, highlighting the considerable benefits and challenges of SOT&#8208;based spintronic devices, are reviewed. First, the materials and structural engineering that enhances SOT efficiency are discussed. Then major experimental results for field&#8208;free SOT switching of perpendicular magnetization are summarized, which includes the introduction of an internal effective magnetic field and the generation of a distinct spin current with out&#8208;of&#8208;plane spin polarization. Finally, advanced SOT functionalities are presented, focusing on the demonstration of reconfigurable and complementary operation in spin logic devices.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes: Pushing Toward the Limits and Beyond</title>
      <dc:description>
Various approaches to enhance the outcoupling efficiency of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) are presented along with a discussion as to what can be done further to realize their ultimate potential. Recent efforts to extend the applications of OLEDs beyond displays are also highlighted. As such examples, OLED&#8208;based health&#8208;monitoring sensors, wearable phototherapeutic patches, and fabric&#8208;like OLEDs are introduced.








Abstract
Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) are established as a mainstream light source for display applications and can now be found in a plethora of consumer electronic devices used daily. This success can be attributed to the rich luminescent properties of organic materials, but efficiency enhancement made over the last few decades has also played a significant role in making OLEDs a practically viable technology. This report summarizes the efforts made so far to improve the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of OLEDs and discusses what should further be done to push toward the ultimate efficiency that can be offered by OLEDs. The study indicates that EQE close to 58% and 80% can be within reach without and with additional light extraction structures, respectively, with an optimal combination of cavity engineering, low&#8208;index transport layers, and horizontal dipole orientation. In addition, recent endeavors to identify possible applications of OLEDs beyond displays are presented with emphasis on their potential in wearable healthcare, such as OLED&#8208;based pulse oximetry as well as phototherapeutic applications based on body&#8208;attachable flexible OLED patches. OLEDs with fabric&#8208;like form factors and washable encapsulation strategies are also introduced as technologies essential to the success of OLED&#8208;based wearable electronics.

      <title>Polydopamine and Its Derivative Surface Chemistry in Material Science: A Focused Review for Studies at KAIST</title>
      <dc:description>
Polydopamine coating, the first material&#8208;independent surface chemistry, and its derivative methods influence nearly all areas of material sciences. Polydopamine chemistry&#8212;material science of four categories (catechol&#8208;containing small molecules, catechol&#8208;tethered polymers, gallol&#8208;containing small molecules, and gallol&#8208;conjugated polymers)&#8212;is discussed in detail.








Abstract
Polydopamine coating, the first material&#8208;independent surface chemistry, and its related methods significantly influence virtually all areas of material science and engineering. Functionalized surfaces of metal oxides, synthetic polymers, noble metals, and carbon materials by polydopamine and its related derivatives exhibit a variety of properties for cell culture, microfluidics, energy storage devices, superwettability, artificial photosynthesis, encapsulation, drug delivery, and numerous others. Unlike other articles, this review particularly focuses on the development of material science utilizing polydopamine and its derivatives coatings at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology for a decade. Herein, it is demonstrated how material&#8208;independent coating methods provide solutions for challenging problems existed in many interdisciplinary areas in bio&#8208;, energy&#8208;, and nanomaterial science by collaborations and independent research.

      <title>Disordered Optics: Exploiting Multiple Light Scattering and Wavefront Shaping for Nonconventional Optical Elements</title>
      <dc:description>
Recent progress on disordered materials is summarized. By exploiting disorder in materials using optical wavefront&#8208;shaping techniques, great potential is shown in enabling functionalities that go beyond their conventional materials, while exhibiting advantages in reduced form factors. Disordered materials will play important roles in both basic physical studies and their application in nanotechnology.








Abstract
Advances in diverse areas such as inspection, imaging, manufacturing, telecommunications, and information processing have been stimulated by novel optical devices. Conventional material ingredients for these devices are typically made of homogeneous refractive or diffractive materials and require sophisticated design and fabrication, which results in practical limitations related to their form and functional figures of merit. To overcome such limitations, recent developments in the application of disordered materials as novel optical elements have indicated great potential in enabling functionalities that go beyond their conventional counterparts, while the materials exhibit potential advantages with respect to reduced form factors. Combined with wavefront shaping, disordered materials enable dynamic transitions between multiple functionalities in a single active optical device. Recent progress in this field is summarized to gain insight into the physical principles behind disordered optics with regard to their advantages in various applications as well as their limitations compared to conventional optics.
