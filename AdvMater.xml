         <title>Engineered Bifunctional Proteins for Targeted Cancer Therapy: Prospects and Challenges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of various forms of bifunctional proteins (BFPs) for cancer treatment is becoming increasingly popular and important. BFPs can simultaneously act on different components in the tumor microenvironment, which are expected to play a diverse role in combating tumor heterogeneity and improving treatment outcomes. A variety of preclinical and early&#8208;stage clinical studies have reported their great potential in cancer treatment.








Abstract
Bifunctional proteins (BFPs) are a class of therapeutic agents produced through genetic engineering and protein engineering, and are increasingly used to treat various human diseases, including cancer. These proteins usually have two or more biological functions&#8212;specifically recognizing different molecular targets to regulate the related signaling pathways, or mediating effector molecules/cells to kill tumor cells. Unlike conventional small&#8208;molecule or single&#8208;target drugs, BFPs possess stronger biological activity but lower systemic toxicity. Hence, BFPs are considered to offer many benefits for the treatment of heterogeneous tumors. In this review, the authors briefly describe the unique structural feature of BFP molecules and innovatively divide them into bispecific antibodies, cytokine&#8208;based BFPs (immunocytokines), and protein toxin&#8208;based BFPs (immunotoxins) according to their mode of action. In addition, the latest advances in the development of BFPs are discussed and the potential limitations or problems in clinical applications are outlined. Taken together, future studies need to be centered on understanding the characteristics of BFPs for optimizing and designing more effective such drugs.

         <title>3D Printing of Superhydrophobic Objects with Bulk Nanostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The principle of polymerization&#8208;induced phase separation is exploited to 3D print superhydrophobic objects with bulk nanostructure and unlimited geometrical freedom. The bulk nanoporous structure of the 3D&#8208;printed superhydrophobic objects not only makes them tolerant to abrasion damage, but also opens new possibilities in applications including gas&#8208;permeable and water&#8208;repellent microfluidics, as well as hierarchically structured super oil absorbents.








Abstract
The rapid development of 3D printing (or additive manufacturing) technologies demands new materials with novel properties and functionalities. Superhydrophobic materials, owing to their ultralow water adhesion, self&#8208;cleaning, anti&#8208;biofouling, or superoleophilic properties are useful for myriad applications involving liquids. However, the majority of the methods for making superhydrophobic surfaces have been based on surface functionalization and coatings, which are challenging to apply to 3D objects. Additionally, these coatings are vulnerable to abrasion due to low mechanical stability and limited thickness. Here, a new materials concept and methodology for 3D printing of superhydrophobic macroscopic objects with bulk nanostructure and almost unlimited geometrical freedom is presented. The method is based on a specific ink composed of hydrophobic (meth)acrylate monomers and porogen solvents, which undergoes phase separation upon photopolymerization to generate inherently nanoporous and superhydrophobic structures. Using a desktop Digital Light Processing printer, superhydrophobic 3D objects with complex shapes are demonstrated, with ultralow and uniform water adhesion measured with scanning droplet adhesion microscopy. It is shown that the 3D&#8208;printed objects, owing to their nanoporous structure throughout the entire volume, preserve their superhydrophobicity upon wear damage. Finally, a superhydrophobic 3D&#8208;printed gas&#8208;permeable and water&#8208;repellent microfluidic device and a hierarchically structured 3D&#8208;printed super&#8208;oil&#8208;absorbent are demonstrated.

         <title>Conquering the Hypoxia Limitation for Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficacy of photodynamic therapy is often restricted by the hypoxic tumor microenvironment (TME). Herein, the strategies are reviewed that are developed to alleviate tumor hypoxia in the past decades, include delivering exogenous O2, in situ O2 generation, reducing cellular O2 consumption by inhibiting respiration, regulating the TME, and inhibiting hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor 1 (HIF&#8208;1) signaling pathway.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has aroused great research interest in recent years owing to its high spatiotemporal selectivity, minimal invasiveness, and low systemic toxicity. However, due to the hypoxic nature characteristic of many solid tumors, PDT is frequently limited in therapeutic effect. Moreover, the consumption of O2 during PDT may further aggravate the tumor hypoxic condition, which promotes tumor proliferation, metastasis, and invasion resulting in poor prognosis of treatment. Therefore, numerous efforts have been made to increase the O2 content in tumor with the goal of enhancing PDT efficacy. Herein, these strategies developed in past decade are comprehensively reviewed to alleviate tumor hypoxia, including 1) delivering exogenous O2 to tumor directly, 2) generating O2 in situ, 3) reducing tumor cellular O2 consumption by inhibiting respiration, 4) regulating the TME, (e.g., normalizing tumor vasculature or disrupting tumor extracellular matrix), and 5) inhibiting the hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor 1 (HIF&#8208;1) signaling pathway to relieve tumor hypoxia. Additionally, the O2&#8208;independent Type&#8208;I PDT is also discussed as an alternative strategy. By reviewing recent progress, it is hoped that this review will provide innovative perspectives in new nanomaterials designed to combat hypoxia and avoid the associated limitation of PDT.

         <title>Fluorescent Nanozeolite Receptors for the Highly Selective and Sensitive Detection of Neurotransmitters in Water and Biofluids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent artificial receptors are introduced that bind neurotransmitters with unprecedented affinity and selectivity in biofluids. They are based on nanozeolite hybrid materials and can be used for emission&#8208; and absorbance&#8208;based detection of serotonin and dopamine in urine at physiological relevant concentration, for (two&#8208;photon) imaging, and for label&#8208;free enzymatic reaction monitoring in real time.








Abstract
The design and preparation of synthetic binders (SBs) applicable for small biomolecule sensing in aqueous media remains very challenging. SBs designed by the lock&#8208;and&#8208;key principle can be selective for their target analyte but usually show an insufficient binding strength in water. In contrast, SBs based on symmetric macrocycles with a hydrophobic cavity can display high binding affinities but generally suffer from indiscriminate binding of many analytes. Herein, a completely new and modular receptor design strategy based on microporous hybrid materials is presented yielding zeolite&#8208;based artificial receptors (ZARs) which reversibly bind the neurotransmitters serotonin and dopamine with unprecedented affinity and selectivity even in saline biofluids. ZARs are thought to uniquely exploit both the non&#8208;classical hydrophobic effect and direct non&#8208;covalent recognition motifs, which is supported by in&#8208;depth photophysical, and calorimetric experiments combined with full atomistic modeling. ZARs are thermally and chemically robust and can be readily prepared at gram scales. Their applicability for the label&#8208;free monitoring of important enzymatic reactions, for (two&#8208;photon) fluorescence imaging, and for high&#8208;throughput diagnostics in biofluids is demonstrated. This study showcases that artificial receptor based on microporous hybrid materials can overcome standing limitations of synthetic chemosensors, paving the way towards personalized diagnostics and metabolomics.

Abstract
Usually, porous materials are synthesized by using conventional electric heating, which can be energy&#8208; and time&#8208;consuming. Microwave heating is commonly used in many households to quickly heat food. Microwave ovens can also be used as powerful devices in the synthesis of various porous materials. The microwave&#8208;assisted synthesis offers a simple, fast, efficient, and economic way to obtain many of the advanced nanomaterials. This review summarizes the recent achievements in the microwave&#8208;assisted synthesis of diverse groups of nanoporous materials including silicas, carbons, metal&#8211;organic frameworks, and metal oxides. Microwave&#8208;assisted methods afford highly porous materials with high specific surface areas (SSAs), e.g., activated carbons with SSA &#8776;3100 m2 g&#8722;1, metal&#8211;organic frameworks with SSA &#8776;4200&#160;m2 g&#8722;1, covalent organic frameworks with SSA &#8776;2900 m2 g&#8722;1, and metal oxides with relatively small SSA &#8776;300 m2 g&#8722;1. These methods are also successfully implemented for the preparation of ordered mesoporous silicas and carbons as well as spherically shaped nanomaterials. Most of the nanoporous materials obtained under microwave irradiation show potential applications in gas adsorption, water treatment, catalysis, energy storage, and drug delivery, among others.

&lt;p&gt;Usually, porous materials are synthesized by using conventional electric heating, which can be energy- and time-consuming. Microwave heating is commonly used in many households to quickly heat food. Microwave ovens can also be used as powerful devices in the synthesis of various porous materials. The microwave-assisted synthesis offers a simple, fast, efficient, and economic way to obtain many of the advanced nanomaterials.

         <title>Manipulating Intratumoral Fenton Chemistry for Enhanced Chemodynamic and Chemodynamic&#8208;Synergized Multimodal Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review first discusses the advances in reinforcement strategies to increase the efficiency of intratumoral Fenton reaction. Then, the multimodal anticancer therapies involving enhanced chemodynamic therapy and mechanisms of synergy are highlighted. Finally, the major challenges and further improvements of this evolving field are elaborated.








Abstract
Chemodynamic therapy (CDT) uses the tumor microenvironment&#8208;assisted intratumoral Fenton reaction for generating highly toxic hydroxyl free radicals (&#8226;OH) to achieve selective tumor treatment. However, the limited intratumoral Fenton reaction efficiency restricts the therapeutic efficacy of CDT. Recent years have witnessed the impressive development of various strategies to increase the efficiency of intratumoral Fenton reaction. The introduction of these reinforcement strategies can dramatically improve the treatment efficiency of CDT and further promote the development of enhanced CDT (ECDT)&#8208;based multimodal anticancer treatments. In this review, the authors systematically introduce these reinforcement strategies, from their basic working principles, reinforcement mechanisms to their representative clinical applications. Then, ECDT&#8208;based multimodal anticancer therapy is discussed, including how to integrate these emerging Fenton reinforcement strategies for accelerating the development of multimodal anticancer therapy, as well as the synergistic mechanisms of ECDT and other treatment methods. Eventually, future direction and challenges of ECDT and ECDT&#8208;based multimodal synergistic therapies are elaborated, highlighting the key scientific problems and unsolved technical bottlenecks to facilitate clinical translation.

         <title>Hybrid Organic&#8211;Inorganic&#8211;Organic Isoporous Membranes with Tunable Pore Sizes and Functionalities for Molecular Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic&#8211;organic isoporous membranes are fabricated via sequential infiltration synthesis and atomic layer deposition within block copolymer membranes followed by addition of functional organic molecules. The membrane pore sizes are controlled by metal oxide growth in a predictive manner. The hybrid membranes exhibit superior selectivity and permeability in separating 1&#8211;2 nm organic molecules and similar&#8208;sized proteins.








Abstract
Accomplishing on&#8208;demand molecular separation with a high selectivity and good permeability is very desirable for pollutant removal and chemical and pharmaceutical processing. The major challenge for sub&#8208;10&#160;nm filtration of particles and molecules is the fabrication of high&#8208;performance membranes with tunable pore size and designed functionality. Here, a versatile top&#8208;down approach is demonstrated to produce such a membrane using isoporous block copolymer membranes with well&#8208;defined pore sizes combined with growth of metal oxide using sequential infiltration synthesis and atomic layer deposition (SIS and ALD). The pore size of the membranes is tuned by controlled metal oxide growth within and onto the polymer channels, enabling up to twofold pore diameter reduction. Following the growth, the distinct functionalities are readily incorporated along the membrane nanochannels with either hydrophobic, cationic, or anionic groups via straightforward and scalable gas/liquid&#8211;solid interface reactions. The hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity of the membrane nanochannel is significantly changed by the introduction of hydrophilic metal oxide and hydrophobic fluorinated groups. The functionalized membranes exhibit a superior selectivity and permeability in separating 1&#8211;2&#160;nm organic molecules and fractionating similar&#8208;sized proteins based on size, charge, and hydrophobicity. This demonstrates the great potential of organic&#8211;inorganic&#8211;organic isoporous membranes for high&#8208;performance molecular separation in numerous applications.

         <title>Engineering d&#8208;p Orbital Hybridization in Single&#8208;Atom Metal&#8208;Embedded Three&#8208;Dimensional Electrodes for Li&#8211;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A descriptor, the d&#8208;p hybridization state between single&#8208;atom metal catalysts (SACs) and sulfur species, is proposed to guide the design of SACs for Li&#8211;S batteries. The large&#8208;sized and flexible three&#8208;dimensional electrodes with optimized SACs achieve high specific energy with low catalyst loading and high sulfur loading. The good mechanical stability for bending also shows potential for fabricating bendable/foldable Li&#8211;S batteries.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom metal catalysts (SACs) are used as sulfur cathode additives to promote battery performance, although the material selection and mechanism that govern the catalytic activity remain unclear. It is shown that d&#8208;p orbital hybridization between the single&#8208;atom metal and the sulfur species can be used as a descriptor for understanding the catalytic activity of SACs in Li&#8211;S batteries. Transition metals with a lower atomic number are found, like Ti, to have fewer filled anti&#8208;bonding states, which effectively bind lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and catalyze their electrochemical reaction. A series of single&#8208;atom metal catalysts (Me = Mn, Cu, Cr, Ti) embedded in three&#8208;dimensional (3D) electrodes are prepared by a controllable nitrogen coordination approach. Among them, the single&#8208;atom Ti&#8208;embedded electrode has the lowest electrochemical barrier to LiPSs reduction/Li2S oxidation and the highest catalytic activity, matching well with the theoretical calculations. By virtue of the highly active catalytic center of single&#8208;atom Ti on the conductive transport network, high sulfur utilization is achieved with a low catalyst loading (1&#160;wt.%) and a high area&#8208;sulfur loading (8&#160;mg cm&#8722;2). With good mechanical stability for bending, these 3D electrodes are suitable for fabricating bendable/foldable Li&#8211;S batteries for wearable electronics.

Synergistic electrical and optical multimodal sensing by 3D nanoarchitectures for label&#8208;free gas detection.








Abstract
Practical sensing applications such as real&#8208;time safety alerts and clinical diagnoses require sensor devices to differentiate between various target molecules with high sensitivity and selectivity, yet conventional devices such as oxide&#8208;based chemo&#8208;resistive sensors and metal&#8208;based surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) sensors usually do not satisfy such requirements. Here, a label&#8208;free, chemo&#8208;resistive/SERS multimodal sensor based on a systematically assembled 3D cross&#8208;point multifunctional nanoarchitecture (3D&#8208;CMA), which has unusually strong enhancements in both &#8220;chemo&#8208;resistive&#8221; and &#8220;SERS&#8221; sensing characteristics is introduced. 3D&#8208;CMA combines several sensing mechanisms and sensing elements via 3D integration of semiconducting SnO2 nanowire frameworks and dual&#8208;functioning Au metallic nanoparticles. It is shown that the multimodal sensor can successfully estimate mixed&#8208;gas compositions selectively and quantitatively at the sub&#8208;100 ppm level, even for mixtures of gaseous aromatic compounds (nitrobenzene and toluene) with very similar molecular structures. This is enabled by combined chemo&#8208;resistive and SERS multimodal sensing providing complementary information.

         <title>Electrical Generation and Deletion of Magnetic Skyrmion&#8208;Bubbles via Vertical Current Injection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new route to generate and delete magnetic skyrmion&#8208;bubbles electrically is presented using a vertical current path. The vertical current path concept is easy to integrate with a widely used spin&#8211;orbit torque device. Using the vertical current path with a spin&#8211;orbit&#8208;torque device, core operations for a skyrmion racetrack memory device in a three&#8208;terminal device are demonstrated.








Abstract
The magnetic skyrmion is a topologically protected spin texture that has attracted much attention as a promising information carrier because of its distinct features of suitability for high&#8208;density storage, low power consumption, and stability. One of the skyrmion devices proposed so far is the skyrmion racetrack memory, which is the skyrmion version of the domain&#8208;wall racetrack memory. For application in devices, skyrmion racetrack memory requires electrical generation, deletion, and displacement of isolated skyrmions. Despite the progress in experimental demonstrations of skyrmion generation, deletion, and displacement, these three operations have yet to be realized in one device. Here, a route for generating and deleting isolated skyrmion&#8208;bubbles through vertical current injection with an explanation of its microscopic origin is presented. By combining the proposed skyrmion&#8208;bubble generation/deletion method with the spin&#8211;orbit&#8208;torque&#8208;driven skyrmion shift, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experimental demonstration of the skyrmion racetrack memory operation in a three&#8208;terminal device structure is provided.

         <title>Construction of Six&#8208;Oxygen&#8208;Coordinated Single Ni Sites on g&#8208;C3N4 with Boron&#8208;Oxo Species for Photocatalytic Water&#8208;Activation&#8208;Induced CO2 Reduction</title>

         <dc:description>
Six&#8208;oxygen&#8208;coordinated single Ni (II) sites are successfully anchored by highly dispersed boron&#8208;oxo species on g&#8208;C3N4 nanosheets. The as&#8208;fabricated single&#8208;atom Ni photocatalyst can realize efficient photocatalytic CO2 reduction, where single Ni atoms can effectively capture photoelectrons and preferentially reduce absorbed water to produce H atoms as active species eventually inducing the reduction of CO2.








Abstract
The configuration regulation of single&#8208;atom photocatalysts (SAPCs) can significantly influence the interfacial charge transfer and subsequent catalytic process. The construction of conventional SAPCs for aqueous CO2 reduction is mainly devoted toward favorable activation and photoreduction of CO2, however, the role of water is frequently neglected. In this work, single Ni atoms are successfully anchored by boron&#8208;oxo species on g&#8208;C3N4 nanosheets through a facile ion&#8208;exchange method. The dative interaction between the B atom and the sp2 N atom of g&#8208;C3N4 guarantees the high dispersion of boron&#8208;oxo species, where O atoms coordinate with single Ni (II) sites to obtain a unique six&#8208;oxygen&#8208;coordinated configuration. The optimized single&#8208;atom Ni photocatalyst, rivaling Pt&#8208;modified g&#8208;C3N4 nanosheets, provides excellent CO2 reduction rate with CO and CH4 as products. Quasi&#8208;in&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectra, transient absorption spectra, isotopic labeling, and in situ Fourier transform infrared spectra reveal that as&#8208;fabricated six&#8208;oxygen&#8208;coordinated single Ni (II) sites can effectively capture the photoelectrons of CN along the B&#63743;O bridges and preferentially activate adsorbed water to produce H atoms to eventually induce a hydrogen&#8208;assisted CO2 reduction. This work diversifies the synthetic strategies for single&#8208;atom catalysts and provides insight on correlation between the single&#8208;atom configuration and reaction pathway.

         <title>Controllable Doping in 2D Layered Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable doping by modulating the thickness is realized in 2D layered materials. The decreasing thickness&#8208;induced lattice deformation makes defects in PtSSe transit from Pt vacancies in thicker PtSSe to anion vacancies in thinner PtSSe, which leads to controllable doping. Thickness&#8208;modulated doping shows great potential in novel electronics and optoelectronics, especially including diodes and photodetectors.








Abstract
For each generation of semiconductors, the issue of doping techniques is always placed at the top of the priority list since it determines whether a material can be used in the electronic and optoelectronic industry or not. When it comes to 2D materials, significant challenges have been found in controllably doping 2D semiconductors into p&#8208; or n&#8208;type, let alone developing a continuous control of this process. Here, a unique self&#8208;modulated doping characteristic in 2D layered materials such as PtSSe, PtS0.8Se1.2, PdSe2, and WSe2 is reported. The varying number of vertically stacked&#8208;monolayers is the critical factor for controllably tuning the same material from p&#8208;type to intrinsic, and to n&#8208;type doping. Importantly, it is found that the thickness&#8208;induced lattice deformation makes defects in PtSSe transit from Pt vacancies to anion vacancies based on dynamic and thermodynamic analyses, which leads to p&#8208; and n&#8208;type conductance, respectively. By thickness&#8208;modulated doping, WSe2 diode exhibits a high rectification ratio of 4400 and a large open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.38&#160;V. Meanwhile, the PtSSe detector overcomes the shortcoming of large dark&#8208;current in narrow&#8208;bandgap optoelectronic devices. All these findings provide a brand&#8208;new perspective for fundamental scientific studies and applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Piezo&#8208;Electrocatalytic Sensing of Ascorbic Acid with Nanostructured Wurtzite Zinc Oxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cost&#8208;efficient, high&#8208;performance piezo&#8208;electrocatalytic sensor is designed for detecting l&#8208;ascorbic acid (AA), a critical chemical for many organisms, metabolic processes, and medical treatments. The electrocatalytic efficacy of AA is significantly boosted by the piezoelectric polarization induced in the nanostructured semiconducting zinc oxide catalysts.








Abstract
Nanostructured piezoelectric semiconductors offer unprecedented opportunities for high&#8208;performance sensing in numerous catalytic processes of biomedical, pharmaceutical, and agricultural interests, leveraging piezocatalysis that enhances the catalytic efficiency with the strain&#8208;induced piezoelectric field. Here, a cost&#8208;efficient, high&#8208;performance piezo&#8208;electrocatalytic sensor for detecting l&#8208;ascorbic acid (AA), a critical chemical for many organisms, metabolic processes, and medical treatments, is designed and demonstrated. Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanorods and nanosheets are prepared to characterize and compare their efficacy for the piezo&#8208;electrocatalysis of AA. The electrocatalytic efficacy of AA is significantly boosted by the piezoelectric polarization induced in the nanostructured semiconducting ZnO catalysts. The charge transfer between the strained ZnO nanostructures and AA is elucidated to reveal the mechanism for the related piezo&#8208;electrocatalytic process. The low&#8208;temperature synthesis of high&#8208;quality ZnO nanostructures allows low&#8208;cost, scalable production, and integration directly into wearable electrocatalytic sensors whose performance can be boosted by otherwise wasted mechanical energy from the working environment, for example, human&#8208;generated mechanical signals.

         <title>An Amorphous Peri&#8208;Implant Ligament with Combined Osteointegration and Energy&#8208;Dissipation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired peri&#8208;implant ligament (PIL) is realized using polymer&#8208;infiltrated amorphous titania nanotubes based on a periodontium&#8208;mimetic architecture. The PIL not only provides exceptional osteoinductivity by more than 18% bone&#8211;implant contact, but also remarkably reduces stress transfer to the peri&#8208;implant bone by &#8776;30% as compared to titanium. The PIL will open new possibilities for developing high&#8208;performance implant materials with increased lifespans.








Abstract
Progress toward developing metal implants as permanent hard&#8208;tissue substitutes requires both osteointegration to achieve load&#8208;bearing support, and energy&#8208;dissipation to prevent overload&#8208;induced bone resorption. However, in existing implants these two properties can only be achieved separately. Optimized by natural evolution, tooth&#8208;periodontal&#8208;ligaments with fiber&#8208;bundle structures can efficiently orchestrate load&#8208;bearing and energy dissipation, which make tooth&#8211;bone complexes survive extremely high occlusion loads (&gt;300 N) for prolonged lifetimes. Here, a bioinspired peri&#8208;implant ligament with simultaneously enhanced osteointegration and energy&#8208;dissipation is presented, which is based on the periodontium&#8208;mimetic architecture of a polymer&#8208;infiltrated, amorphous, titania nanotube array. The artificial ligament not only provides exceptional osteoinductivity owing to its nanotopography and beneficial ingredients, but also produces periodontium&#8208;similar energy dissipation due to the complexity of the force transmission modes and interface sliding. The ligament increases bone&#8211;implant contact by more than 18% and simultaneously reduces the effective stress transfer from implant to peri&#8208;implant bone by &#8776;30% as compared to titanium implants, which as far as is known has not previously been achieved. It is anticipated that the concept of an artificial ligament will open new possibilities for developing high&#8208;performance implanted materials with increased lifespans.

&lt;p&gt;A bioinspired peri-implant ligament (PIL) is realized using polymer-infiltrated amorphous titania nanotubes based on a periodontium-mimetic architecture. The PIL not only provides exceptional osteoinductivity by more than 18% bone&#8211;implant contact, but also remarkably reduces stress transfer to the peri-implant bone by &#8776;30% as compared to titanium. The PIL will open new possibilities for developing high-performance implant materials with increased lifespans.

         <title>Design Principles of Sodium/Potassium Protection Layer for High&#8208;Power High&#8208;Energy Sodium/Potassium&#8208;Metal Batteries in Carbonate Electrolytes: a Case Study of Na2Te/K2Te</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Na2Te (K2Te) protection layer with high ionic conductivity, low electronic conductivity, and high mechanical stability on Na (K) metal anode is designed and prepared. Therefore, the Na@Na2Te (K@K2Te) realizes excellent electrochemical performance for sodium (potassium) metal batteries of both symmetrical cells and full batteries in widely used carbonate electrolytes.








Abstract
The sodium (potassium)&#8208;metal anodes combine low&#8208;cost, high theoretical capacity, and high energy density, demonstrating promising application in sodium (potassium)&#8208;metal batteries. However, the dendrites&#8217; growth on the surface of Na (K) has impeded their practical application. Herein, density functional theory (DFT) results predict Na2Te/K2Te is beneficial for Na+/K+ transport and can effectively suppress the formation of the dendrites because of low Na+/K+ migration energy barrier and ultrahigh Na+/K+ diffusion coefficient of 3.7 &#215; 10&#8722;10 cm2 s&#8722;1/1.6 &#215; 10&#8722;10 cm2 s&#8722;1 (300 K), respectively. Then a Na2Te protection layer is prepared by directly painting the nanosized Te powder onto the sodium&#8208;metal surface. The Na@Na2Te anode can last for 700 h in low&#8208;cost carbonate electrolytes (1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, 1 mAh cm&#8722;2), and the corresponding Na3V2 (PO4)3//Na@Na2Te full cell exhibits high energy density of 223&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at an unprecedented power density of 29687 W kg&#8722;1 as well as an ultrahigh capacity retention of 93% after 3000 cycles at 20 C. Besides, the K@K2Te&#8208;based potassium&#8208;metal full battery also demonstrates high power density of 20 577 W kg&#8722;1 with energy density of 154&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1. This work opens up a new and promising avenue to stabilize sodium (potassium)&#8208;metal anodes with simple and low&#8208;cost interfacial layers.

         <title>A Conductive Network and Dipole Field for Harnessing Photogenerated Charge Kinetics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The TiO2 network exhibits two orders of magnitude enhancement in electric conductivity, which will greatly suppress electron&#8211;hole (e&#8211;h) recombination by reducing the charge&#8208;transfer resistance. In addition, 2D MXene induces a dipole at the interface. The dipole field pushes charge extraction and suppresses charge recombination by inducing band bending.








Abstract
Photogenerated charge separation and directional transfer to active sites are pivotal steps in photocatalysis, which limit the efficiency of redox reactions. Here, a conductive network and dipole field are employed to harness photogenerated charge kinetics by using a Ti3C2/TiO2 network (TTN). The TTN exhibits a prolonged charge&#8208;carrier lifetime (1.026&#160;ns) and an 11.76&#8208;fold increase in hexavalent chromium photoreduction reaction kinetics compared to TiO2 nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs). This super photocatalytic performance is derived from the efficient photogenerated charge kinetics, which is steered by the conductive network and dipole field. The conductivity enhancement of the TiO2 network is achieved by continuous chemical bonds, which promotes electron&#8211;hole (e&#8211;h) separation. In addition, at the interface of Ti3C2 and TiO2, band bending induced by the dipole field promotes photogenerated electron spatially directed transfer to the catalytic sites on Ti3C2. This study demonstrates that a conductive network and dipole field offer a new concept to harness charge kinetics for photocatalysis.

         <title>Evolution of Graphene Patterning: From Dimension Regulation to Molecular Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphene patterning has attracted widespread attention owing to its ability to tailor the structures and properties of graphene, targeting high&#8208;tech applications. The established strategies have been evolved from the initial dimension regulation to the emerging molecular engineering of graphene sheet. In general, these methods can be divided into top&#8208;down/bottom&#8208;up and chemical patterning routes as comprehensively disused in this review.








Abstract
The realization that nanostructured graphene featuring nanoscale width can confine electrons to open its bandgap has aroused scientists&#8217; attention to the regulation of graphene structures, where the concept of graphene patterns emerged. Exploring various effective methods for creating graphene patterns has led to the birth of a new field termed graphene patterning, which has evolved into the most vigorous and intriguing branch of graphene research during the past decade. The efforts in this field have resulted in the development of numerous strategies to structure graphene, affording a variety of graphene patterns with tailored shapes and sizes. The established patterning approaches combined with graphene chemistry yields a novel chemical patterning route via molecular engineering, which opens up a new era in graphene research. In this review, the currently developed graphene patterning strategies is systematically outlined, with emphasis on the chemical patterning. In addition to introducing the basic concepts and the important progress of traditional methods, which are generally categorized into top&#8208;down, bottom&#8208;up technologies, an exhaustive review of established protocols for emerging chemical patterning is presented. At the end, an outlook for future development and challenges is proposed.

         <title>Volatilizable Solid Additive&#8208;Assisted Treatment Enables Organic Solar Cells with Efficiency over 18.8% and Fill Factor Exceeding 80%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new morphology control approach is developed to fabricate high&#8208;performance organic solar cells by utilizing the synergistic effect of 1&#8208;chloronaphthalene (CN) and dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;d]thiophene (DTT) additives. This approach exhibits general application in various active layer systems to achieve well&#8208;developed morphology, enabled outstanding power&#8208;conversion efficiency over 18.8% and fill factor exceeding 80% for the device based on PTQ10:m&#8208;BTP&#8208;PhC6:PC71BM.








Abstract
Controlling the self&#8208;assembling of organic semiconductors to form well&#8208;developed nanoscale phase separation in the bulk&#8208;heterojunction active layer is critical yet challenging for building high&#8208;performance organic solar cells (OSCs). Particularly, the similar anisotropic conjugated structures between nonfullerene acceptors and p&#8208;type organic semiconductor donors raise more complexity on manipulating their aggregation toward appropriate phase separation. Herein, a new approach to tune the morphology of photoactive layer is developed by utilizing the synergistic effect of dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;d]thiophene (DTT) and 1&#8208;chloronaphthalene (CN). The volatilizable solid additive DTT with high crystallinity can restrict the over self&#8208;assembling of nonfullerene acceptors during the film casting process, and then allowing the refining of phase separation and molecular packing with the simultaneous volatilization of DTT under thermal annealing.

&lt;p&gt;A new morphology control approach is developed to fabricate high-performance organic solar cells by utilizing the synergistic effect of 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) and dithieno[3,2-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;:2&#8242;,3&#8242;-&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;]thiophene (DTT) additives. This approach exhibits general application in various active layer systems to achieve well-developed morphology, enabled outstanding power-conversion efficiency over 18.8% and fill factor exceeding 80% for the device based on PTQ10:m-BTP-PhC6:PC&lt;sub&gt;71&lt;/sub&gt;BM.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Controlling the self-assembling of organic semiconductors to form well-developed nanoscale phase separation in the bulk-heterojunction active layer is critical yet challenging for building high-performance organic solar cells (OSCs). Particularly, the similar anisotropic conjugated structures between nonfullerene acceptors and p-type organic semiconductor donors raise more complexity on manipulating their aggregation toward appropriate phase separation. Herein, a new approach to tune the morphology of photoactive layer is developed by utilizing the synergistic effect of dithieno[3,2-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;:2&#8242;,3&#8242;-&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;]thiophene (DTT) and 1-chloronaphthalene (CN). The volatilizable solid additive DTT with high crystallinity can restrict the over self-assembling of nonfullerene acceptors during the film casting process, and then allowing the refining of phase separation and molecular packing with the simultaneous volatilization of DTT under thermal annealing. Consequently, the PTQ10:&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;-BTP-PhC6:PC&lt;sub&gt;71&lt;/sub&gt;BM-based ternary OSCs processed by the dual additives of CN and DTT record a notable power-conversion efficiency of 18.89%, with a remarkable FF of 80.6%.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecule&#8208;Upgraded van der Waals Contacts for Schottky&#8208;Barrier&#8208;Free Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upgraded van der Waals metal&#8211;semiconductor contacts with near&#8208;zero Schottky barrier are realized by the stable, efficient, and non&#8208;residue molecule treatment of reducing the Schottky barrier width, to enable record&#8208;setting performance metrics of atomically thin transistors.








Abstract
The applications of any ultrathin semiconductor device are inseparable from high&#8208;quality metal&#8211;semiconductor contacts with designed Schottky barriers. Building van der Waals (vdWs) contacts of 2D semiconductors represents an advanced strategy of lowering the Schottky barrier height by reducing interface states, but will finally fail at the theoretical minimum barrier due to the inevitable energy difference between the semiconductor electron affinity and the metal work function. Here, an effective molecule optimization strategy is reported to upgrade the general vdWs contacts, achieving near&#8208;zero Schottky barriers and creating high&#8208;performance electronic devices. The molecule treatment can induce the defect healing effect in p&#8208;type semiconductors and further enhance the hole density, leading to an effectively thinned Schottky barrier width and improved carrier interface transmission efficiency. With an ultrathin Schottky barrier width of &#8776;2.17&#160;nm and outstanding contact resistance of &#8776;9 k&#937;&#160;&#181;m in the optimized Au/WSe2 contacts, an ultrahigh field&#8208;effect mobility of &#8776;148&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 in chemical vapor deposition grown WSe2 flakes is achieved. Unlike conventional chemical treatments, this molecule upgradation strategy leaves no residue and displays a high&#8208;temperature stability at &gt;200 &#176;C. Furthermore, the Schottky barrier optimization is generalized to other metal&#8211;semiconductor contacts, including 1T&#8208;PtSe2/WSe2, 1T&#8242;&#8208;MoTe2/WSe2, 2H&#8208;NbS2/WSe2, and Au/PdSe2, defining a simple, universal, and scalable method to minimize contact resistance.

         <title>Highly Sensitive Capacitive Pressure Sensors over a Wide Pressure Range Enabled by the Hybrid Responses of a Highly Porous Nanocomposite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low sensitivity at large pressure is a long&#8208;standing obstacle of capacitive pressure sensors. A novel soft capacitive pressure sensor that employs an electrically conductive porous nanocomposite is a promising solution for resolving this chronic challenge. This hybrid&#8208;response pressure sensor exhibits unprecedented sensitivity up to 50 kPa. An analytical model explains its mechanism and enables selection of optimal manufacturing parameters.








Abstract
Past research aimed at increasing the sensitivity of capacitive pressure sensors has mostly focused on developing dielectric layers with surface/porous structures or higher dielectric constants. However, such strategies have only been effective in improving sensitivities at low pressure ranges (e.g., up to 3&#160;kPa). To overcome this well&#8208;known obstacle, herein, a flexible hybrid&#8208;response pressure sensor (HRPS) composed of an electrically conductive porous nanocomposite (PNC) laminated with an ultrathin dielectric layer is devised. Using a nickel foam template, the PNC is fabricated with carbon nanotubes (CNTs)&#8208;doped Ecoflex to be 86% porous and electrically conductive. The PNC exhibits hybrid piezoresistive and piezocapacitive responses, resulting in significantly enhanced sensitivities (i.e., more than 400%) over wide pressure ranges, from 3.13 kPa&#8722;1 within 0&#8211;1 kPa to 0.43 kPa&#8722;1 within 30&#8211;50 kPa. The effect of the hybrid responses is differentiated from the effect of porosity or high dielectric constants by comparing the HRPS with its purely piezocapacitive counterparts. Fundamental understanding of the HRPS and the prediction of optimal CNT doping are achieved through simplified analytical models. The HRPS is able to measure pressures from as subtle as the temporal arterial pulse to as large as footsteps.

         <title>Direct Atomic&#8208;Scale Structure and Electric Field Imaging of Triazine&#8208;Based Crystalline Carbon Nitride</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The differential phase contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy technique reveals the local atomic configuration and also directly determines the atomic electric field of poly(triazine imide) crystal, the triazine&#8208;based crystalline carbon nitride. These findings offer a fundamental insight on the electronic structure for photoabsorption and the migration of charge carriers in photocatalysis with this material.








Abstract
Crystalline carbon nitrides (CNs) have recently attracted considerable attention owing to their superior photocatalytic activity. However, the electron&#8208;beam&#8208;sensitive nature of crystalline CNs hinders atomic&#8208;resolution imaging of their local structures by conventional (scanning) transmission electron microscopy ((S)TEM) techniques. Here, the atomic structure of a triazine&#8208;based crystalline CN, poly(triazine imide) (PTI) incorporated with lithium and chloride ions, is unambiguously revealed using the emerging imaging technique of differential phase contrast STEM under a low dose. The lightest&#8208;element Li/H configuration is resolved within framework cavities of PTI and significantly affects the electronic structure for photoabsorption. The atomic electric field of PTI crystal directly determined in real space provides a fundamental evidence for the chemical bonding of Li ions and adjacent atoms for the migration of photogenerated carriers. These results facilitate the comprehension on local atomic configuration and chemical bonding state of crystalline CNs and can lead to a deeper understanding of the photocatalytic mechanism.

First, the unique structural characteristics and properties of nanocellulose are briefly introduced. Second, the structure&#8211;property&#8211;application relationships of these composites are addressed to optimize their performances from the perspective of processing technologies and micro/nano&#8208;interface structure. Next, the recent specific applications of nanocellulose&#8208;based composites, ranging from flexible lithium&#8208;ion batteries and electrochemical supercapacitors to emerging electrochemical energy storage devices, such as lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries, sodium&#8208;ion batteries, and zinc&#8208;ion batteries, are comprehensively discussed.

         <title>Coupling Glucose&#8208;Assisted Cu(I)/Cu(II) Redox with Electrochemical Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a new approach is proposed to achieve low voltage and continuous hydrogen production using glucose&#8208;assisted Cu(I)/Cu(II) redox as anode reaction. Glucose in electrolyte can reduce the Cu(II) into Cu(I) spontaneously, thus completing the cycle of Cu(I)/Cu(II) redox. The assembled electrolyzer only requires a voltage input of 0.92&#160;V to achieve a current density of 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Water electrolysis is a sustainable technology for hydrogen production since this process can utilize the intermittent electricity generated by renewable energy such as solar, wind, and hydro. However, the large&#8208;scale application of this process is restricted by the high electricity consumption due to the large potential gap (&gt;1.23&#160;V) between the anodic oxygen evolution reaction and the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, a novel and efficient hydrogen production system is developed for coupling glucose&#8208;assisted Cu(I)/Cu(II) redox with HER. The onset potential of the electrooxidation of Cu(I) to Cu(II) is as low as 0.7 VRHE (vs reversible hydrogen electrode). In situ Raman spectroscopy, ex situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculation demonstrates that glucose in the electrolyte can reduce the Cu(II) into Cu(I) instantaneously via a thermocatalysis process, thus completing the cycle of Cu(I)/Cu(II) redox. The assembled electrolyzer only requires a voltage input of 0.92&#160;V to achieve a current density of 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Consequently, the electricity consumption for per cubic H2 produced in the system is 2.2&#160;kWh, only half of the value for conventional water electrolysis (4.5&#160;kWh). This work provides a promising strategy for the low&#8208;cost, efficient production of high&#8208;purity H2.

         <title>Carbon&#8208;Based Electrocatalysts for Efficient Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review comprehensively introduces the latest advances in carbon&#8208;based hybrid catalysts toward hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. In particular, the design of functional groups and the dependence of electrolyte pH play important roles to further improve the selectivity of H2O2 production via the oxygen reduction reaction.








Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an environment&#8208;friendly and efficient oxidant with a wide range of applications in different industries. Recently, the production of hydrogen peroxide through direct electrosynthesis has attracted widespread research attention, and has emerged as the most promising method to replace the traditional energy&#8208;intensive multi&#8208;step anthraquinone process. In ongoing efforts to achieve highly efficient large&#8208;scale electrosynthesis of H2O2, carbon&#8208;based materials have been developed as 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction catalysts, with the benefits of low cost, abundant availability, and optimal performance. This review comprehensively introduces the strategies for optimizing carbon&#8208;based materials toward H2O2 production, and the latest advances in carbon&#8208;based hybrid catalysts. The active sites of the carbon&#8208;based materials and the influence of coordination heteroatom doping on the selectivity of H2O2 are extensively analyzed. In particular, the appropriate design of functional groups and understanding the effect of the electrolyte pH are expected to further improve the selective efficiency of producing H2O2 via the oxygen reduction reaction. Methods for improving catalytic activity by interface engineering and reaction kinetics are summarized. Finally, the challenges carbon&#8208;based catalysts face before they can be employed for commercial&#8208;scale H2O2 production are identified, and prospects for designing novel electrochemical reactors are proposed.

         <title>Reborn Three&#8208;Dimensional Graphene with Ultrahigh Volumetric Desalination Capacity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3DG is repeatedly crushed and reshaped to upgrade its overall performance like &#8220;Phoenix Nirvana.&#8221; 3DG is reborn to a higher self as NvG, making it emerge with unprecedented advantages in areas such as capacitive deionization and becoming a new engine to initiate the development of innovative 3D structures for carbon materials.








Abstract
The constructing of 3D materials with optimal performance is urgently needed to meet the growing demand of advanced materials in the high&#8208;tech sector. A distinctive 3D graphene (3DG) is designed based on a repeated rebirth strategy to obtain a better body and performance after each round of rebirth, as if it is Phoenix Nirvana. The properties of reborn graphene, namely 3DG after Nirvana (NvG), has been dramatically upgraded compared to 3DG, including high density (3.36 times) together with high porosity, as well as better electrical conductivity (1.41 times), mechanical strength (32.4 times), and ultrafast infiltration behavior. These advantages of NvG make it a strong intrinsic motivation for application in capacitive deionization (CDI). Using NvG directly as the CDI electrode, it has an extremely high volumetric capacity of 220&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;3 at 1&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;3 and a maximum salt absorption capacity of 8.02~9.2&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;3 (8.9&#8211;10.2 times), while the power consumption for adsorption of the same mass of salt is less than a quarter of 3DG. The &#8220;Phoenix Nirvana&#8221;&#8208;like strategy of manufacturing 3D structures will undoubtedly become the new engine to kick&#8208;start the development of innovative carbon materials through an overall performance upgrade.

         <title>Molecularly Engineered Black Phosphorus Heterostructures with Improved Ambient Stability and Enhanced Charge Carrier Mobility</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular engineering strategy is demonstrated to prepare ambient stable black phosphorus (BP)/hexaazatriphenylene (HAT) hybrid heterostructures. This strategy not only modifies the band structure of BP sheets but also improves their charge mobility, paving the way toward ambient processing and fabrication of high&#8208;performance BP&#8208;based devices.








Abstract
Overcoming the intrinsic instability and preserving unique electronic properties are key challenges for the practical applications of black phosphorus (BP) under ambient conditions. Here, it is demonstrated that molecular heterostructures of BP and hexaazatriphenylene derivatives (BP/HATs) enable improved environmental stability and charge transport properties. The strong interfacial coupling and charge transfer between the HATs and the BP lattice decrease the surface electron density and protect BP sheets from oxidation, resulting in an excellent ambient lifetime of up to 21 d. Importantly, HATs increase the charge scattering time of BP, contributing to an improved carrier mobility of 97 cm2 V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1, almost three times of the pristine BP films, based on noninvasive THz spectroscopic studies. The film mobility is an order of magnitude larger than previously reported values in exfoliated 2D materials. The strategy opens up new avenues for versatile applications of BP sheets and provides an effective method for tuning the physicochemical properties of other air&#8208;sensitive 2D semiconductors.

         <title>Updated Insights into 3D Architecture Electrodes for Micropower Sources</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D architecture electrode design enhances energy storage capability within a limited footprint area. This review comprehensively elucidates the superiority of 3D architecture electrodes for performance improvement of microbatteries and microsupercapacitors. The most recent research advances, current challenges, and future perspectives are outlined and discussed.








Abstract
Microbatteries (MBs) and microsupercapacitors (MSCs) are primary on&#8208;chip micropower sources that drive autonomous and stand&#8208;alone microelectronic devices for implementation of the Internet of Things (IoT). However, the performance of conventional MBs and MSCs is restricted by their 2D thin&#8208;film electrode design, and these devices struggle to satisfy the increasing IoT energy demands for high energy density, high power density, and long lifespan. The energy densities of MBs and MSCs can be improved significantly through adoption of a 2D thick&#8208;film electrode design; however, their power densities and lifespans deteriorate with increased electrode thickness.

&lt;p&gt;3D architecture electrode design enhances energy storage capability within a limited footprint area. This review comprehensively elucidates the superiority of 3D architecture electrodes for performance improvement of microbatteries and microsupercapacitors. The most recent research advances, current challenges, and future perspectives are outlined and discussed.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microbatteries (MBs) and microsupercapacitors (MSCs) are primary on-chip micropower sources that drive autonomous and stand-alone microelectronic devices for implementation of the Internet of Things (IoT). However, the performance of conventional MBs and MSCs is restricted by their 2D thin-film electrode design, and these devices struggle to satisfy the increasing IoT energy demands for high energy density, high power density, and long lifespan. The energy densities of MBs and MSCs can be improved significantly through adoption of a 2D thick-film electrode design; however, their power densities and lifespans deteriorate with increased electrode thickness. In contrast, 3D architecture electrodes offer remarkable opportunities to simultaneously improve MB and MSC energy density, power density, and lifespan. To date, various 3D architecture electrodes have been designed, fabricated, and investigated for MBs and MSCs. This review provides an update on the principal superiorities of 3D architecture electrodes over 2D thick-film electrodes in the context of improved MB and MSC energy density, power density, and lifespan. In addition, the most recent and representative progress in 3D architecture electrode development for MBs and MSCs is highlighted. Finally, present challenges are discussed and key perspectives for future research in this field are outlined.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Understanding the Synergistic Oxidation in Dichalcogenides through Electrochemiluminescence Blinking at Millisecond Resolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistic oxidation in molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is revealed through electrochemiluminescence blinking. The formation of sulfur vacancies at MoS2, by the edge activation of hydrogen peroxide and the oxygen migration to the basal plane, is more conducive to oxygen doping, which favors the formation of Mo&#8208;O&#8208;Mo, as active sites. This mechanism is universal to transition metal dichalcogenides containing sulfur atoms.








Abstract
The oxidation of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) has been extensively studied and applied in electronics, optics, and energy sources because of its tunable structure and performance. However, due to the lack of appropriate technology, dynamically observe the oxidation process remains an arduous task. Herein, the synergistic oxidation between edge and basal plane in molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is observed through electrogenerated chemiluminescence (ECL) blinking with a millisecond resolution. In addition, the ECL method provides a simple, convenient, and quick way to judge structural changes. The transient elevation of the ECL intensity proved the intermittent doping of oxygen at MoS2, which generates O&#8208;atom active sites. High ECL intensity enhanced from the produced hydroperoxide intermediates eases the monitoring of MoS2 particles. Further study shows that the formation of sulfur vacancies at MoS2, by the edge activation of hydrogen peroxide and the migration of oxygen to the basal plane, is more conducive to oxygen doping that favors the formation of Mo&#63743;O&#63743;Mo as new active sites to induce bursts. The revealing of sulfur vacancy&#8208;governed blinking from MoS2 indicates a complex interaction between oxygen and MoS2. The same phenomenon is observed on tungsten disulfide (WS2), which provides new information about the oxidation feature of 2D dichalcogenides.

         <title>Elastic Lattice and Excess Charge Carrier Manipulation in 1D&#8211;3D Perovskite Solar Cells for Exceptionally Long&#8208;Term Operational Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electro&#8208;strictive strain in 3D polycrystalline perovskite is first observed, which can lead to an accelerated ion migration under operational conditions. And the 1D&#8211;3D perovskite, that is, 1D BnPbI3 perovskite spatially distributed in the 3D perovskite film and compensates the dangling bonds in the grain boundaries, can effectively inhibit electro&#8208;strictive responses and unbalanced charge carrier extraction, realizing the ultra&#8208;long operational stability.








Abstract
3D organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid halide perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs) inherently face severe instability issue due to ion migration under operational conditions. This ion migration inevitably results from the decomposition of ionic bonds under lattice strain and is accelerated by the existence of excess charge carriers. In this study, a 1D&#8211;3D mixed&#8208;dimensional perovskite material is explored by adding an organic salt with a bulk benzimidazole cation (Bn+). The Bn+ can induce 3D perovskite crystalline growth with the preferred orientation and form a 1D BnPbI3 perovskite spatially distributed in the 3D perovskite film. For the first time, the electro&#8208;strictive response, which has a significant influence on the lattice strain under an electric field, is observed in polycrystalline perovskite. The 1D&#8211;3D perovskite can effectively suppress electro&#8208;strictive responses and unbalanced charge carrier extraction, providing an intrinsically stable lattice with enhanced ionic bonds and fewer excess charge carriers. As a result, the ion migration behavior of the p&#8208;i&#8208;n 1D&#8211;3D based pero&#8208;SC is dramatically suppressed under operational conditions, showing ultra&#8208;long&#8208;term stability that retains 95.3% of its initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) under operation for 3072 h, and simultaneously achieving an excellent PCE with a hysteresis&#8208;free photovoltaic behavior.

         <title>Bioengineering Approaches for the Advanced Organoid Research</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emergence of organoid technologies, in terms of development of 3D miniature organs in vitro, has provided revolutionized approaches for understanding developmental processes and disease modeling. Comprehensive insights into the materials and genome engineering techniques applied to organoid culture are demonstrated. Based on the recent achievements, prospects and key challenges for the next&#8208;generation organoid technologies are also discussed.








Abstract
Recent advances in 3D cell culture technology have enabled scientists to generate stem cell derived organoids that recapitulate the structural and functional characteristics of native organs. Current organoid technologies have been striding toward identifying the essential factors for controlling the processes involved in organoid development, including physical cues and biochemical signaling. There is a growing demand for engineering dynamic niches characterized by conditions that resemble in vivo organogenesis to generate reproducible and reliable organoids for various applications. Innovative biomaterial&#8208;based and advanced engineering&#8208;based approaches have been incorporated into conventional organoid culture methods to facilitate the development of organoid research. The recent advances in organoid engineering, including extracellular matrices and genetic modulation, are comprehensively summarized to pinpoint the parameters critical for organ&#8208;specific patterning. Moreover, perspective trends in developing tunable organoids in response to exogenous and endogenous cues are discussed for next&#8208;generation developmental studies, disease modeling, and therapeutics.

         <title>Engineering Photoresponsive Ligand Tethers for Mechanical Regulation of Stem Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy is developed to regulate the behaviors and functions of stem cells by switching the states of light switchable tethers. This method offers the chance to study the mechanotransduction via cellular tethers and realize the spatiotemporal regulation of differential cell fates.








Abstract
Regulating stem cell functions by precisely controlling the nanoscale presentation of bioactive ligands has a substantial impact on tissue engineering and regenerative medicine but remains a major challenge. Here it is shown that bioactive ligands can become mechanically &#8220;invisible&#8221; by increasing their tether lengths to the substrate beyond a critical length, providing a way to regulate mechanotransduction without changing the biochemical conditions. Building on this finding, light switchable tethers are rationally designed, whose lengths can be modulated reversibly by switching a light&#8208;responsive protein, pdDronpa, in between monomer and dimer states. This allows the regulation of the adhesion, spreading, and differentiation of stem cells by light on substrates of well&#8208;defined biochemical and physical properties. Spatiotemporal regulation of differential cell fates on the same substrate is further demonstrated, which may represent an important step toward constructing complex organoids or mini tissues by spatially defining the mechanical cues of the cellular microenvironment with light.

Combining unique yolk&#8208;shell structure with synergistic effect of the three components, the MTCN&#8208;H (ys) demonstrates remarkable catalytic performance in photocatalytic reduction of CO2 with H2O.








Abstract
The precise tuning and multi&#8208;dimensional processing of covalent organic frameworks (COFs)&#8208;based materials into multicomponent superstructures with appropriate diversity are essential to maximize their advantages in catalytic reactions. However, up to now, it remains an ongoing challenge for the precise design of COFs&#8208;based multicomponent nanocomposites with diverse architectures. Herein, a metal organic framework (MOF)&#8208;sacrificed in situ acid&#8208;etching (MSISAE) strategy that enables continuous synthesis of core&#8208;shell, yolk&#8208;shell, and hollow&#8208;sphere COFs&#8208;based nanocomposites through tuning of core decomposition (NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 into TiO2) rate is developed. More importantly, due to the multiple active sites, fast transfer of carriers, increased light utilization ability, et al, one of the obtained samples, NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125/TiO2@COF&#8208;366&#8208;Ni&#8208;OH&#8208;HAc (yolk&#8208;shell) with special three components, exhibits high photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion efficiency in the gas&#8208;solid mode. The MSISAE strategy developed in this work achieves the precise morphology design and control of multicomponent hybrid composites based on COFs, which may pave a new way in devealoping porous crystalline materials with powerful superstructures for multifunctional catalytic reactions.

         <title>Liquid Crystal Elastomer Metamaterials with Giant Biaxial Thermal Shrinkage for Enhancing Skin Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper develops unique mechanics&#8208;guided designs and fabrication schemes of liquid crystal elastomer metamaterials that allow access to unprecedented biaxial actuation shrinkage and negative thermal expansion. A low&#8208;temperature synthesis method enables excellent actuation performances at a substantially reduced temperature. Such biocompatible metamaterial is integrated with dressing to develop a shrinkable, hemostatic patch for enhancing skin regeneration.








Abstract
Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are a class of soft active materials of increasing interest, because of their excellent actuation and optical performances. While LCEs show biomimetic mechanical properties (e.g., elastic modulus and strength) that can be matched with those of soft biological tissues, their biointegrated applications have been rarely explored, in part, due to their high actuation temperatures (typically above 60&#160;&#176;C) and low biaxial actuation performances (e.g., actuation strain typically below 10%). Here, unique mechanics&#8208;guided designs and fabrication schemes of LCE metamaterials are developed that allow access to unprecedented biaxial actuation strain (&#8722;53%) and biaxial coefficient of thermal expansion (&#8722;33&#160;125&#160;ppm&#160;K&#8722;1), significantly surpassing those (e.g., &#8722;20% and &#8722;5950&#160;ppm&#160;K&#8722;1) reported previously. A low&#8208;temperature synthesis method with use of optimized composition ratios enables LCE metamaterials to offer reasonably high actuation stresses/strains at a substantially reduced actuation temperature (46&#160;&#176;C). Such biocompatible LCE metamaterials are integrated with medical dressing to develop a breathable, shrinkable, hemostatic patch as a means of noninvasive treatment. In vivo animal experiments of skin repair with both round and cross&#8208;shaped wounds demonstrate advantages of the hemostatic patch over conventional strategies (e.g., medical dressing and suturing) in accelerating skin regeneration, while avoiding scar and keloid generation.

Abstract
Hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) has emerged as a strong candidate for two&#8208;dimensional (2D) material owing to its exciting optoelectrical properties combined with mechanical robustness, thermal stability, and chemical inertness. Super&#8208;thin h&#8208;BN layers have gained significant attention from the scientific community for many applications, including nanoelectronics, photonics, biomedical, anti&#8208;corrosion, and catalysis, among others. This review provides a systematic elaboration of the structural, electrical, mechanical, optical, and thermal properties of h&#8208;BN followed by a comprehensive account of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art synthesis strategies for 2D h&#8208;BN, including chemical exfoliation, chemical, and physical vapor deposition, and other methods that have been successfully developed in recent years. It further elaborates a wide variety of processing routes developed for doping, substitution, functionalization, and combination with other materials to form heterostructures. Based on the extraordinary properties and thermal&#8208;mechanical&#8208;chemical stability of 2D&#160;h&#8208;BN, various potential applications of these structures are described.

         <title>Efficient and Spectrally Stable Blue Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Employing a Cationic &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorene&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;conjugated cationic polymer as a multifunctional passivator to suppress non&#8208;radiative processes, improve charge transport properties, and inhibit ion migration for blue mixed&#8208;halide perovskite semiconductors is reported. As a result, efficient and spectrally stable blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes with the emission wavelengths from 485 to 458 nanometres were&#160;achieved.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskite semiconductors have demonstrated remarkable potentials in solution&#8208;processed blue light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). However, the unsatisfied efficiency and spectral stability responsible for trap&#8208;mediated non&#8208;radiative losses and halide phase segregation remain the primary unsolved challenges for blue perovskite LEDs. In this study, it is reported that a fluorene&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;conjugated cationic polymer can be blended with the perovskite semiconductor to control film formation and optoelectronic properties. As a result, sky&#8208;blue and true&#8208;blue perovskite LEDs with Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage coordinates of (0.08, 0.22) and (0.12, 0.13) at the record external quantum efficiencies of 11.2% and 8.0% were&#160;achieved. In addition, the mixed halide perovskites with the conjugated cationic polymer exhibit excellent spectral stability under external bias. This result illustrates that &#960;&#8208;conjugated cationic polymers have a great potential to realize efficient blue mixed&#8208;halide perovskite LEDs with stable electroluminescence.

         <title>Tuning Conjugated Polymer Chain Packing for Stretchable Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bulky additive molecules residing between amorphous chain networks can disrupt the crystalline ordering of polymer semiconductors. The long&#8208;range crystalline domains are suppressed while short&#8208;range aggregations of conjugated polymers are promoted, leading to an improved thin&#8208;film stretchability without affecting charge transport under an external strain up to 100%.








Abstract
In order to apply polymer semiconductors to stretchable electronics, they need to be easily deformed under strain without being damaged. A small number of conjugated polymers, typically with semicrystalline packing structures, have been reported to exhibit mechanical stretchability. Herein, a method is reported to modify polymer semiconductor packing&#8208;structure using a molecular additive, dioctyl phthalate (DOP), which is found to act as a molecular spacer, to be inserted between the amorphous chain networks and disrupt the crystalline packing. As a result, large&#8208;crystal growth is suppressed while short&#8208;range aggregations of conjugated polymers are promoted, which leads to an improved mechanical stretchability without affecting charge&#8208;carrier transport. Due to the reduced conjugated polymer intermolecular interactions, strain&#8208;induced chain alignment and crystallization are observed.

&lt;p&gt;Bulky additive molecules residing between amorphous chain networks can disrupt the crystalline ordering of polymer semiconductors. The long-range crystalline domains are suppressed while short-range aggregations of conjugated polymers are promoted, leading to an improved thin-film stretchability without affecting charge transport under an external strain up to 100%.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to apply polymer semiconductors to stretchable electronics, they need to be easily deformed under strain without being damaged. A small number of conjugated polymers, typically with semicrystalline packing structures, have been reported to exhibit mechanical stretchability. Herein, a method is reported to modify polymer semiconductor packing-structure using a molecular additive, dioctyl phthalate (DOP), which is found to act as a molecular spacer, to be inserted between the amorphous chain networks and disrupt the crystalline packing. As a result, large-crystal growth is suppressed while short-range aggregations of conjugated polymers are promoted, which leads to an improved mechanical stretchability without affecting charge-carrier transport. Due to the reduced conjugated polymer intermolecular interactions, strain-induced chain alignment and crystallization are observed. By adding DOP to a well-known conjugated polymer, poly[2,5-bis(4-decyltetradecyl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-(2&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;,5&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;)-dione-(E)-1,2-di(2,2&#8242;-bithiophen-5-yl)ethene] (DPPTVT), stretchable transistors are obtained with anisotropic charge-carrier mobilities under strain, and stable current output under strain up to 100%.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

2D amorphous MoS3&#8208;on&#8208;rGO heterostructure is first constructed via an isotropic growth process for beyond&#8208;lithium&#8208;ion batteries (Na+, K+, and Zn2+) with outstanding electrochemical performance and superior cyclic stability. The amorphous MoS3&#8208;on&#8208;rGO exhibits low strain and fast reaction kinetics during cycling.








Abstract
Beyond&#8208;lithium&#8208;ion storage devices are promising alternatives to lithium&#8208;ion storage devices for low&#8208;cost and large&#8208;scale applications. Nowadays, the most of high&#8208;capacity electrodes are crystal materials. However, these crystal materials with intrinsic anisotropy feature generally suffer from lattice strain and structure pulverization during the electrochemical process. Herein, a 2D heterostructure of amorphous molybdenum sulfide (MoS3) on reduced graphene surface (denoted as MoS3&#8208;on&#8208;rGO), which exhibits low strain and fast reaction kinetics for beyond&#8208;lithium&#8208;ions (Na+, K+, Zn2+) storage is demonstrated. Benefiting from the low volume expansion and small sodiation strain of the MoS3&#8208;on&#8208;rGO, it displays ultralong cycling performance of 40&#8201;000&#160;cycles at 10&#160;A g&#8722;1 for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. Furthermore, the as&#8208;constructed 2D heterostructure also delivers superior electrochemical performance when used in Na+ full batteries, solid&#8208;state sodium batteries, K+ batteries, Zn2+ batteries and hybrid supercapacitors, demonstrating its excellent application prospect.

         <title>Self&#8208;Powered Interactive Fiber Electronics with Visual&#8211;Digital Synergies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bimodal fiber electronics that can simultaneously visualize and digitize mechanical stimulus without external power supply. The novel visual&#8211;digital synergies mechanism endows the fiber electronics with excellent optical and electrical performance, and new temporal&#8211;spatial resolution. Industrial&#8208;level scalable manufacture and recycling are thoroughly demonstrated. This bimodal fiber electronics shows unique application in human&#8211;machine interfaces and underwater sensing.








Abstract
Fiber electronics with mechanosensory functionality are highly desirable in healthcare, human&#8211;machine interfaces, and robotics. Most efforts are committed to optimize the electronically readable interface of fiber mechanoreceptor, while the user interface based on naked&#8208;eye readable output is rarely explored. Here, a scalable fiber electronics that can simultaneously visualize and digitize the mechanical stimulus without external power supply, named self&#8208;powered optoelectronic synergistic fiber sensors (SOEFSs), are reported. By coupling of space and surface charge polarization, a new mechanoluminescent (ML)&#8208;triboelectric synergistic effect is realized. It contributes to remarkable enhancement of both electrical (by 100%) and optical output (by 30%), as well as novel temporal&#8211;spatial resolution mode for motion capturing. Based on entirely new thermoplastic ML material system and spinning process, industrial&#8208;level continuously manufacture and recycling processes of SOEFS are realized. Furthermore, SOEFSs&#8217; application in human&#8211;machine interface, virtual reality, and underwater sensing, rescue, and information interaction is demonstrated.

         <title>Textile Waste Fiber Regeneration via a Green Chemistry Approach: A Molecular Strategy for Sustainable Fashion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a green chemical method for complete separation and regeneration of natural/synthetic blended fabrics, which aims to provide a universal recycling strategy for fast fashion waste and provide a new source of fibers. Besides single&#8208;component fibers, a new composite fiber consisting of cellulose and wool keratin is also regenerated, which presents unique morphology differing from previous studies.








Abstract
Fast fashion, as a continuously growing part of the textile industry, is widely criticized for its excessive resource use and high generation of textiles. To reduce its environmental impacts, numerous efforts are focused on finding sustainable and eco&#8208;friendly approaches to textile recycling. However, waste textiles and fibers are still mainly disposed of in landfills or by incineration after their service life and thereby pollute the natural environment, as there is still no effective strategy to separate natural fibers from chemical fibers. Herein, a green chemistry strategy is developed for the separation and regeneration of waste textiles at the molecular level. Cellulose/wool keratin composite fibers and multicomponent fibers are regenerated from waste textiles via a green chemical process. The strategy attempts to reduce the large amount of waste textiles generated by the fast&#8208;developing fashion industry and provide a new source of fibers, which can also address the fossil fuel reserve shortages caused by chemical fiber industries and global food shortages caused by natural fiber production.

         <title>Impact of Nanoscale Morphology on Charge Carrier Delocalization and Mobility in an Organic Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hole carrier wavefunction is propagated through samples of pentacene with varying levels of structural disorder using surface hopping non&#8208;adiabatic molecular dynamics. It is found that charge carriers are more delocalized, that is, more &#8220;quantum&#8221; than previously thought, even for relatively disordered samples, and establish the mechanism of charge transport as a function of crystallinity.








Abstract
A central challenge of organic semiconductor research is to make cheap, disordered materials that exhibit high electrical conductivity. Unfortunately, this endeavor is hampered by the poor fundamental understanding of the relationship between molecular packing structure and charge carrier mobility. Here a novel computational methodology is presented that fills this gap. Using a melt&#8208;quench procedure it is shown that amorphous pentacene spontaneously self&#8208;assembles to nanocrystalline structures that, at long quench times, form the characteristic herringbone layer of the single crystal. Quantum dynamical simulations of electron hole transport show a clear correlation between the crystallinity of the sample, the quantum delocalization, and the mobility of the charge carrier. Surprisingly, the long&#8208;held belief that charge carriers form relatively localized polarons in disordered OS is only valid for fully amorphous structures&#8212;for nanocrystalline and crystalline samples, significant charge carrier delocalization over several nanometers occurs that underpins their improved conductivities. The good agreement with experimentally available data makes the presented methodology a robust computational tool for the predictive engineering of disordered organic materials.

Tomoscopy provides up to 1000 tomograms per second at &#181;m&#8208;range resolution, running experiments for minutes without interruption. Tomoscopy is applied to study various dynamic processes in materials science.








Abstract
The structure and constitution of opaque materials can be studied with X&#8208;ray imaging methods such as 3D tomography. To observe the dynamic evolution of their structure and the distribution of constituents, for example, during processing, heating, mechanical loading, etc., 3D imaging has to be fast enough. In this paper, the recent developments of time&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray tomography that have led to what one now calls &#8220;tomoscopy&#8221; are briefly reviewed A novel setup is presented and applied that pushes temporal resolution down to just 1&#160;ms, that is, 1000&#160;tomograms per second (tps) are acquired, while maintaining spatial resolutions of micrometers and running experiments for minutes without interruption. Applications recorded at different acquisition rates ranging from 50 to 1000&#160;tps are presented. The authors observe and quantify the immiscible hypermonotectic reaction of AlBi10 (in wt%) alloy and dendrite evolution in AlGe10 (in wt%) casting alloy during fast solidification. The combustion process and the evolution of the constituents are analyzed in a burning sparkler. Finally, the authors follow the structure and density of two metal foams over a long period of time and derive details of bubble formation and bubble ageing including quantitative analyses of bubble parameters with millisecond temporal resolution.

         <title>Rational Design and General Synthesis of Multimetallic Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nano&#8208;Octahedra for Enhanced Li&#8211;S Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of Mn&#8208;based multimetallic metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nano&#8208;octahedra are prepared. The synthetic strategy is utilized to incorporate metal ions into the MOF architecture, of which the parent monometallic MOF nano&#8208;octahedra could not be prepared directly, thus rationally generating novel multimetallic MOFs, which also allows for the general synthesis of various micro&#8208;/nanoscale MOFs in the energy storage field.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), which consist of central metal nodes and organic linkers, constitute a fast growing class of crystalline porous materials with excellent application potential. Herein, a series of Mn&#8208;based multimetallic MOF (bimetallic and trimetallic MIL&#8208;100) nano&#8208;octahedra are prepared by a facile one&#8208;pot synthetic strategy. The types and proportions of the incorporated elements can be tuned while retaining the original topological structure. The introduction of other metal ions is verified at the atomic level by combining X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure experiments and theoretical calculations. Furthermore, these multimetallic Mn&#8208;based MIL&#8208;100 nano&#8208;octahedra are utilized as sulfur hosts to prepare cathodes for Li&#8211;S batteries. The MnNi&#8208;MIL&#8208;100@S cathode exhibits the best Li&#8211;S battery performance among all reported MIL&#8208;100@S composite cathode materials, with a reversible capacity of &#8776;708.8 mAh g&#8722;1 after 200 cycles. The synthetic strategy described herein is utilized to incorporate metal ions into the MOF architecture, of which the parent monometallic MOF nano&#8208;octahedra cannot be prepared directly, thus rationally generating novel multimetallic MOFs. Importantly, the strategy also allows for the general synthesis and study of various micro&#8208;/nanoscale MOFs in the energy storage field.

         <title>Nature&#8208;Inspired Circular&#8208;Economy Recycling for Proteins: Proof of Concept</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mixtures of peptides and high&#8208;tech proteins (silk fibroins, &#946;&#8208;lactoglobulin films) are depolymerized into their amino acid components. Such amino acids are used as the only source of monomers for polymerizing biotechnologically relevant proteins (fluorescent proteins, catechol 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase), outside living organisms. The process is repeated multiple times showing that sequence&#8208;defined polymers can be recycled by fulfilling the principles of circular economy.








Abstract
The billion tons of synthetic&#8208;polymer&#8208;based materials (i.e. plastics) produced yearly are a great challenge for humanity. Nature produces even more natural polymers, yet they are sustainable. Proteins are sequence&#8208;defined natural polymers that are constantly recycled when living systems feed. Digestion is the protein depolymerization into amino acids (the monomers) followed by their re&#8208;assembly into new proteins of arbitrarily different sequence and function. This breaks a common recycling paradigm where a material is recycled into itself. Organisms feed off of random protein mixtures that are &#8220;recycled&#8221; into new proteins whose identity depends on the cell's specific needs. In this study, mixtures of several peptides and/or proteins are depolymerized into their amino acid constituents, and these amino acids are used to synthesize new fluorescent, and bioactive proteins extracellularly by using an amino&#8208;acid&#8208;free, cell&#8208;free transcription&#8211;translation (TX&#8211;TL) system. Specifically, three peptides (magainin II, glucagon, and somatostatin 28) are digested using thermolysin first and then using leucine aminopeptidase. The amino acids so produced are added to a commercial TX&#8211;TL system to produce fluorescent proteins. Furthermore, proteins with high relevance in materials engineering (&#946;&#8208;lactoglobulin films, used for water filtration, or silk fibroin solutions) are successfully recycled into biotechnologically relevant proteins (fluorescent proteins, catechol 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase).

         <title>Bioinspired Multifunctional Photonic&#8208;Electronic Smart Skin for Ultrasensitive Health Monitoring, for Visual and Self&#8208;Powered Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrasensitive self&#8208;powered mechanoluminescence smart skin (SPMSS) with bioinspired strain&#8208;dependent microcrack structure has been designed and fabricated. The SPMSS demonstrates ultrasensitive sensing performances including ultralow detection limit, ultrahigh sensitivity, and ultrafast response. The SPMSS displays tunable and highly sensitive mechanoluminescence features for visual sensing and exhibits excellent triboelectric nanogenerator properties for reliable power source supply and self&#8208;powered sensing.








Abstract
Smart skin is highly desired to be ultrasensitive and self&#8208;powered as the medium of artificial intelligence. Here, an ultrasensitive self&#8208;powered mechanoluminescence smart skin (SPMSS) inspired by the luminescence mechanism of cephalopod skin and the ultrasensitive response of spider&#8208;slit&#8208;organ is developed. Benefitting from the unique strain&#8208;dependent microcrack structure design based on Ti3C2Tx (MXene)/carbon nanotube synergistic interaction, SPMSS possesses excellent strain sensing performances including ultralow detection limit (0.001% strain), ultrahigh sensitivity (gauge factor, GF = 3.92 &#215; 107), ultrafast response time (5&#160;ms), and superior durability and stability (&gt;45&#8201;000 cycles). Synchronously, SPMSS exhibits tunable and highly sensitive mechanoluminescence (ML) features under stretching. A relationship between ML features, strain sensing performances, and the deformation has been established successfully. Importantly, the SPMSS demonstrates excellent properties as triboelectric nanogenerator (4 &#215; 4 cm2), including ultrahigh triboelectric output (open&#8208;circuit voltage VOC&#160;= 540&#160;V, short&#8208;circuit current ISC&#160;= 42 &#181;A, short&#8208;circuit charge QSC&#160;= 317 nC) and power density (7.42 W m&#8722;2), endowing the smart skin with reliable power source supply and self&#8208;powered sensing ability. This bioinspired smart skin exhibits multifunctional applications in health monitoring, visual sensing, and self&#8208;powered sensing, showing great potential in artificial intelligence.

         <title>Synergistic Therapy of a Naturally Inspired Glycopolymer&#8208;Based Biomimetic Nanomedicine Harnessing Tumor Genomic Instability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by saccharide unit and its weak interactions and combined advantages of branched polymers, glycopolymer&#8211;pyropheophorbide&#8208;a conjugates are optimized for enhanced PDT, effective olaparib incorporation, and naturally tumor cell membrane modified ability. The obtained biomimetic nanomedicine with homotypic cancer targeting ability achieves a prominent antitumor effect via harnessing tumor genomic instability, providing a platform strategy for synergistic nanomedicines combat with cancer.








Abstract
Inspired by natural saccharide&#8208;protein complexes, a stimuli&#8208;responsive biodegradable and branched glycopolymer&#8211;pyropheophorbide&#8208;a (Ppa) conjugate (BSP) with saccharide units for cancer therapy is constructed. A linear glycopolymeric conjugate (LSP), a branched glycopolymeric conjugate (BShP) from Ppa with long carbon chains, and a branched conjugate (BHSP) based on poly[N&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide] (polyHPMA) without saccharide units are prepared as controls.

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by saccharide unit and its weak interactions and combined advantages of branched polymers, glycopolymer&#8211;pyropheophorbide-a conjugates are optimized for enhanced PDT, effective olaparib incorporation, and naturally tumor cell membrane modified ability. The obtained biomimetic nanomedicine with homotypic cancer targeting ability achieves a prominent antitumor effect via harnessing tumor genomic instability, providing a platform strategy for synergistic nanomedicines combat with cancer.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by natural saccharide-protein complexes, a stimuli-responsive biodegradable and branched glycopolymer&#8211;pyropheophorbide-a (Ppa) conjugate (BSP) with saccharide units for cancer therapy is constructed. A linear glycopolymeric conjugate (LSP), a branched glycopolymeric conjugate (BShP) from Ppa with long carbon chains, and a branched conjugate (BHSP) based on poly[&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-(2-hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide] (polyHPMA) without saccharide units are prepared as controls. Through structure&#8211;activity relationship studies, BSP with a 3D network structure forms stable nanostructures via weak intermolecular interactions, regulating the stacking state of Ppa to improve the singlet oxygen quantum yield and the corresponding photodynamic therapy (PDT) effect. BSP shows high loading of olaparib, and are further coated with tumor cell membranes, resulting in a biomimetic nanomedicine (CM-BSPO). CM-BSPO shows highly efficient tumor targeting and cellular internalization properties. The engulfment of CM-BSPO accompanied with laser irradiation results in a prominent antitumor effect, evidenced by disruption of cell cycles in tumor cells, increased apoptosis and DNA damage, and subsequent inhibition of repair for damaged DNA. The mechanism for the synergistic effect from PDT and olaparib is unveiled at the genetic and protein level through transcriptome analysis.

         <title>Calcium Phosphate&#8208;Reinforced Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Regulate Adenosine&#8208;Mediated Immunosuppression</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calcium phosphate&#8208;reinforced iron&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (CaP@Fe&#8208;MOFs) are designed to reduce adenosine accumulation and to inhibit adenosine&#8208;mediated immunosuppressive response. CaP@Fe&#8208;MOFs regulate the adenosine metabolism by promoting adenosine kinase&#8208;mediated phosphorylation and relieving the hypoxic tumor microenvironment. Moreover, CaP@Fe&#8208;MOFs enhance the antitumor immune response via adenosine regulation, including the increase of T lymphocytes and dendritic cells and the decrease of regulatory T lymphocytes.








Abstract
Long&#8208;term accumulation of adenosine (Ado) in tumor tissues helps to establish the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and to promote tumor development. Regulation of Ado metabolism is particularly pivotal for blocking Ado&#8208;mediated immunosuppression. The activity of adenosine kinase (ADK) for catalyzing the phosphorylation of Ado plays an essential role in regulating Ado metabolism. Specifically, accumulated Ado in the tumor microenvironment occupies the active site of ADK, inhibiting the phosphorylation of Ado. Phosphate can protect ADK from inactivation and restore the activity of ADK. Herein, calcium phosphate&#8208;reinforced iron&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (CaP@Fe&#8208;MOFs) are designed to reduce Ado accumulation and to inhibit Ado&#8208;mediated immunosuppressive response in the tumor microenvironment. CaP@Fe&#8208;MOFs are found to regulate the Ado metabolism by promoting ADK&#8208;mediated phosphorylation and relieving the hypoxic tumor microenvironment. Moreover, CaP@Fe&#8208;MOFs can enhance the antitumor immune response via Ado regulation, including the increase of T lymphocytes and dendritic cells and the decrease of regulatory T lymphocytes. Finally, CaP@Fe&#8208;MOFs are used for cancer treatment in mice, alleviating the Ado&#8208;mediated immunosuppressive response and achieving tumor suppression. This study may offer a general strategy for blocking the Ado&#8208;mediated immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment and further for enhancing the immunotherapy efficacy in vivo.

         <title>NanoRobotic Structures with Embedded Actuation via Ion Induced Folding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, a novel fabrication method for 4D nanorobotic systems via ion&#8208;induced folding is introduced. By tailoring the patterning and folding parameters, dynamic 4D microstructures with personalized properties are achieved using planar multilayer structures obtained by batch fabrication. High nanorobotic performances have been demonstrated theoretically and experimentally through a folded gripper.








Abstract
4D structures are tridimensional structures with time&#8208;varying abilities that provide high versatility, sophisticated designs, and a broad spectrum of actuation and sensing possibilities. The downsizing of these structures below 100 &#956;m opens up exceptional opportunities for many disciplines, including photonics, acoustics, medicine, and nanorobotics. However, it requires a paradigm shift in manufacturing methods, especially for dynamic structures. A novel fabrication method based on ion&#8208;induced folding of planar multilayer structures embedding their actuation is proposed&#8212;the planar structures are fabricated in bulk through batch microfabrication techniques. Programmable and accurate bidirectional foldings (&#8722;70&#176;&#160;&#8722;&#160;+90&#176;) of Silica/Chromium/Aluminium (SiO2/Cr/Al) multilayer structures are modeled, experimentally demonstrated then applied to embedded electrothermal actuation of controllable and dynamic 4D nanorobotic structures. The method is used to produce high&#8208;performances case&#8208;study grippers for nanorobotic applications in confined environments. Once folded, a gripping task at the nano&#8208;scale is demonstrated. The proposed fabrication method is suitable for creating small&#8208;scale 4D systems for nanorobotics, medical devices, and tunable metamaterials, where rapid folding and enhanced dynamic control are required.

         <dc:description>
A molten&#8208;salt&#8208;assisted crystallization (MSAC) strategy is developed to improve grain growth of the all&#8208;inorganic perovskite films. MSAC enables more active mass transfer and interaction among precursor colloids. The devices based on the MSAC strategy show much increased efficiency to as high as 19.83% with open&#8208;circuit voltage as high as 1.2&#160;V.








Abstract
Dynamic manipulation of crystallization is pivotal to the quality of polycrystalline films. A molten&#8208;salt&#8208;assisted crystallization (MSAC) strategy is presented to improve grain growth of the all&#8208;inorganic perovskite films. Compared with the traditional solvent annealing, MSAC enables more intensive mass transfer by means of convection and diffusion, which is beneficial to the interaction among the precursor colloids and to inducing in&#8208;plane growth of perovskite grains, resulting in the formation of high&#8208;quality perovskite films with suppressed pinhole and crack formation. Additionally, the introduction of molten salt alters the intermediate phases, and thus changes the crystallization pathways by reducing the energy barrier to produce films with desired optical and electrical properties. As a result, the MSAC strategy endows the devices with champion steady&#8208;state output efficiency of 19.83% and open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) as high as 1.2&#160;V, among the highest for this type of solar cell, thanks to its effectively reduced Voc deficit.

         <title>Ubiquitination Flow Repressors: Enhancing Wound Healing of Infectious Diabetic Ulcers through Stabilization of Polyubiquitinated Hypoxia&#8208;Inducible Factor&#8208;1&#945; by Theranostic Nitric Oxide Nanogenerators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A subcutaneous injectable near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;triggered theranostic nitric oxide nanogenerator is bioengineered to maintain hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor&#8208;1&#945; (HIF&#8208;1&#945;) stability by repressing ubiquitination&#8208;mediated protein degradation and promote diabetic ulcer healing. This nanogenerator is also capable of early detection and elimination of wound infections.








Abstract
Current treatments for diabetic ulcers (DUs) remain unsatisfactory due to the risk of bacterial infection and impaired angiogenesis during the healing process. The increased degradation of polyubiquitinated hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor&#8208;1&#945; (HIF&#8208;1&#945;) compromises wound healing efficacy. Therefore, the maintenance of HIF&#8208;1&#945; protein stability might help treat DU. Nitric oxide (NO) is an intrinsic biological messenger that functions as a ubiquitination flow repressor and antibacterial agent; however, its clinical application in DU treatment is hindered by the difficulty in controlling NO release. Here, an intelligent near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;triggered NO nanogenerator (SNP@MOF&#8208;UCNP@ssPDA&#8208;Cy7/IR786s, abbreviated as SNP@UCM) is presented. SNP@UCM represses ubiquitination&#8208;mediated proteasomal degradation of HIF&#8208;1&#945; by inhibiting its interaction with E3 ubiquitin ligases under NIR irradiation. Increased HIF&#8208;1&#945; expression in endothelial cells by SNP@UCM enhances angiogenesis in wound sites, promoting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion and cell proliferation and migration. SNP@UCM also enables early detection of wound infections and ROS&#8208;mediated killing of bacteria. The potential clinical utility of SNP@UCM is further demonstrated in infected full&#8208;thickness DU model under NIR irradiation. SNP@UCM is the first reported HIF&#8208;1&#945;&#8208;stabilizing advanced nanomaterial, and further materials engineering might offer a facile, mechanism&#8208;based method for clinical DU management.

         <title>Boron Nitride Nanosheets Can Induce Water Channels Across Lipid Bilayers Leading to Lysosomal Permeabilization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interactions of hexagonal boron nitride nanosheets with cells are revealed using a combination of molecular dynamics simulations, liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation, and in vitro imaging methods. Lipid bilayer penetration occurs through a cross&#8208;membrane water channel formation, opening the door to a better understanding of the potential cytotoxicity mechanisms of 2D materials and their biomedical applications.








Abstract
While the interaction between 2D materials and cells is of key importance to the development of nanomedicines and safe applications of nanotechnology, still little is known about the biological interactions of many emerging 2D materials. Here, an investigation of how hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) interacts with the cell membrane is carried out by combining molecular dynamics (MD), liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation, and in vitro imaging methods. MD simulations reveal that a sharp hBN wedge can penetrate a lipid bilayer and form a cross&#8208;membrane water channel along its exposed polar edges, while a round hBN sheet does not exhibit this behavior. It is hypothesized that such water channels can facilitate cross&#8208;membrane transport, with important consequences including lysosomal membrane permeabilization, an emerging mechanism of cellular toxicity that involves the release of cathepsin B and generation of radical oxygen species leading to cell apoptosis. To test this hypothesis, two types of hBN nanosheets, one with a rhomboidal, cornered morphology and one with a round morphology, are prepared, and human lung epithelial cells are exposed to both materials. The cornered hBN with lateral polar edges results in a dose&#8208;dependent cytotoxic effect, whereas round hBN does not cause significant toxicity, thus confirming our&#160;premise.

         <title>AIEgen&#8208;Based Lifetime&#8208;Probes for Precise Furin Quantification and Identification of Cell Subtypes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An AIEgen&#8208;based PyTPA&#8208;ZGO probe with three lifetime signals is proposed for precise furin quantification, including signal 1 of AIEgen (&#964;Pn), signal 2 of inorganic nanoparticles (&#964;Zn), and signal 3 as the composite dual&#8208;lifetime signal (CDLSn). Furthermore, CDLSn exhibits higher accuracy than &#964;Pn and &#964;Zn in identifying cell subtypes based on the specific furin concentration in each subtype.








Abstract
Biochemical sensing probes based on aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission luminogens (AIEgens) are widely used in biological imaging and therapy, chemical sensing, and material sciences. However, it is still a great challenge to quantify the targets through fluorescence intensity of AIEgen probes due to their undesirable aggregations. Here, a PyTPA&#8208;ZGO probe with three lifetime signals for precise quantification of furin is constructed: the lifetime signal 1 and signal 2 comes from AIEgen PyTPA&#8208;P (&#964;Pn) and inorganic nanoparticles Zn2GeO4:Mn2+&#8208;NH2 (&#964;Zn), respectively, while the lifetime signal 3 is marked as the composite dual&#8208;lifetime signal (CDLSn, CDLSn=&#964;Zn&#964;Pn). In contrast, the fluorescence intensity signal of PyTPA&#8208;P shows defectively quantitative performance. Furthermore, it is found that the CDLSn exhibits higher significant differences than the two other lifetime signals (&#964;Pn and &#964;Zn) thanks to its wide range between the maximum and minimum signal values and small standard deviation. Therefore, CDLSn is further used to accurately identify cell subtypes based on the specific concentration of furin in each subtype. The lifetime criterion can realize precise quantification, and it should be a promising direction of AIEgen&#8208;based quantitative analysis in the future.

         <title>Large&#8208;Area Pixelized Optoelectronic Neuromorphic Devices with Multispectral Light&#8208;Modulated Bidirectional Synaptic Circuits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A large&#8208;area optoelectronic neuromorphic system demonstrates the hardware training of random images using multispectral light signals. It provides the first demonstration of a monolithically integrated and scalable optoelectronic neuromorphic devices composed of a heterostructure phototransistor and circuit component with standard complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (CMOS) processing, which is capable of efficient pattern recognition by the fully optic&#8208;derived signals.








Abstract
The complete hardware implementation of an optoelectronic neuromorphic computing system is considered as one of the most promising solutions to realize energy&#8208;efficient artificial intelligence. Here, a fully light&#8208;driven and scalable optoelectronic neuromorphic circuit with metal&#8208;chalcogenide/metal&#8208;oxide heterostructure phototransistor and photovoltaic divider is proposed. To achieve wavelength&#8208;selective neural operation and hardware&#8208;based pattern recognition, multispectral light modulated bidirectional synaptic circuits are utilized as an individual pixel for highly accurate and large&#8208;area neuromorphic computing system. The wavelength selective control of photo&#8208;generated charges at the heterostructure interface enables the bidirectional synaptic modulation behaviors including the excitatory and inhibitory modulations. More importantly, a 7 &#215; 7 neuromorphic pixel circuit array is demonstrated to show the viability of implementing highly accurate hardware&#8208;based pattern training. In both the pixel training and pattern recognition simulation, the neuromorphic circuit array with the bidirectional synaptic modulation exhibits lower training errors and higher recognition rates, respectively.

         <title>A Liquid Metal Mediated Metallic Coating for Antimicrobial and Antiviral Fabrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article offers a simple method to coat metallic particles on fibers. Liquid metal (LM), gallium particles serve as an adhesive nucleation layer to reduce copper ions into metallic copper via galvanic replacement. The liquid metal&#8211;copper (LMCu) particles have excellent antimicrobial and antiviral activity against a wide range of bacteria, fungi, and influenza and corona viruses.








Abstract
Fabrics are widely used in hospitals and many other settings for bedding, clothing, and face masks; however, microbial pathogens can survive on surfaces for a long time, leading to microbial transmission. Coatings of metallic particles on fabrics have been widely used to eradicate pathogens. However, current metal particle coating technologies encounter numerous issues such as nonuniformity, processing complexity, and poor adhesion. To overcome these issues, an easy&#8208;to&#8208;control and straightforward method is reported to coat a wide range of fabrics by using gallium liquid metal (LM) particles to facilitate the deposition of liquid metal copper alloy (LMCu) particles. Gallium particles coated on the fabric provide nucleation sites for forming LMCu particles at room temperature via galvanic replacement of Cu2+ ions. The LM helps promote strong adhesion of the particles to the fabric. The presence of the LMCu particles can eradicate over 99% of pathogens (including bacteria, fungi, and viruses) within 5&#160;min, which is significantly more effective than control samples coated with only Cu. The coating remains effective over multiple usages and against contaminated droplets and aerosols, such as those encountered in facemasks. This facile coating method is promising for generating robust antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral fabrics and surfaces.

The effective size of zeolite pores is systematically tuned using a versatile methoid wherein organic molecules are covalently attached to zeolite frameworks via bridging oxygens using an electrophile, thereby obtaining size&#8208;selective adsorbents for light olefin/paraffin separations. 4&#8208;Methoxybenzene&#8208;functionalized MOR separates ethylene from ethane, whereas toluene&#8208;grafted MOR separates propylene/propane mixtures. Therefore, tailoring the molecular&#8208;sieving properties of zeolites by organic&#8208;functionalization broadens their applications to challenging separations.








Abstract
Zeolite molecular sieves are widely used in gas separation and shape&#8208;selective catalysis, but these applications often require discriminating differences as little as 0.1 &#197;. Molecular sieving with such size selectivity demands zeolites with highly tunable pore diameters and adsorption properties, which are technically challenging to prepare. Nevertheless, it is shown that a wide range of organic functional groups can be covalently functionalized onto the interior pore walls of the zeolites, MOR, LTL, FAU, and MFI, to systematically &#8220;tune&#8221; their effective pore diameters with respect to the size of organic groups. For organic functionalization, small and aggressive organic electrophiles are used (e.g., organo&#8208;halide and &#8208;diazonium) as grafting agents, which are accessible to the intracrystalline void space, forming a C&#8211;Ozeolite bond in a reaction with a bridging oxygen as proved by multiple analysis data. It is demonstrated that the post&#8208;functionalization can be used to tailor the molecular sieving action of a parent zeolite to give size&#8208;selective adsorbents for light olefin/paraffin separations. 4&#8208;Methoxybenzene&#8208;functionalized MOR separates ethylene from ethane with an ideal&#8208;adsorbed&#8208;solution&#8208;theory selectivity of &#8776;5873, whereas toluene&#8208;grafted MOR completely separates propylene/propane mixtures. Therefore, tailoring the molecular&#8208;sieving properties of zeolites by organic functionalization broadens their applications to challenging separations.

&lt;p&gt;The effective size of zeolite pores is systematically tuned using a versatile methoid wherein organic molecules are covalently attached to zeolite frameworks via bridging oxygens using an electrophile, thereby obtaining size-selective adsorbents for light olefin/paraffin separations. 4-Methoxybenzene-functionalized MOR separates ethylene from ethane, whereas toluene-grafted MOR separates propylene/propane mixtures.

         <title>Lattice&#8208;Confined Ir Clusters on Pd Nanosheets with Charge Redistribution for the Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction under Alkaline Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient Ir@Pd heterostructured electrocatalyst is designed for the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) in alkaline media. The well&#8208;defined heterointerface with charge redistribution possesses an optimal balance between the adsorption of Had and OHad, and substantially promotes the HOR kinetics as well as durability. The results highlight the significance of engineering multifunctional heterointerface for designing advanced alkaline HOR electrocatalysts.








Abstract
Electrocatalysts with high activity and long&#8208;term stability for the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) under alkaline conditions is still a major challenge for anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs). Herein, a heterostructured Ir@Pd electrocatalyst with ultrasmall Ir nanoclusters (NCs) epitaxially confined on Pd nanosheets (NSs) for catalyzing the sluggish alkaline HOR is reported. Apparent charge redistribution occurs across the heterointerface, and both experimental and theoretical results suggest that the electrons transfer from Pd to Ir, which consequently greatly weakens the hydrogen binding on Pd. More interestingly, the interfacial epitaxy results in the formation of Ir/IrO2 Janus nanostructures, where the partially oxidized Ir species away from the interface further optimize the hydroxyl adsorption behavior. The unique Ir@Pd heterostructure eventually shows an optimal balance between hydrogen and hydroxyl adsorption, and hence exhibits impressive HOR activity with an exchange current density of up to 7.18&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 in 0.1 m KOH solution. In addition, the Ir@Pd electrocatalyst exhibits negligible activity degradation owing to the confinement effect of the unique epitaxial interface.

         <title>Liquid Crystal Structure of Supercooled Liquid Gallium and Eutectic Gallium&#8211;Indium</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 38, September 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The existence of a liquid crystal (LC) mesophase in metallic materials is counterintuitive. Typical LCs are made of covalently bonded organic molecules. This study reports on the observation of LC mesophases in supercooled liquid gallium and eutectic gallium&#8211;indium alloy. An LC texture of the lamellar structure similar to that of the smectic phase is unveiled at room temperature.








Abstract
Understanding the origin of structural ordering in supercooled liquid gallium (Ga) has been a great scientific quest in the past decades. Here, reflective polarized optical microscopy on Ga sandwiched between glasses treated with rubbed polymers reveals the onset of an anisotropic reflection at 120&#160;&#176;C that increases on cooling and persists down to room temperature or below. The polymer rubbing usually aligns the director of thermotropic liquid crystals (LCs) parallel to the rubbing direction. On the other hand, when Ga is sandwiched between substrates that align conventional LC molecules normal to the surface, the reflection is isotropic, but mechanical shear force induces anisotropic reflection that relaxes in seconds. Such alignment effects and shear&#8208;induced realignment are typical to conventional thermotropic LCs and indicate a LC structure of liquid Ga. Specifically, Ga textures obtained by atomic force and scanning electron microscopy reveal the existence of a lamellar structure corresponding to a smectic LC phase, while the nanometer&#8208;thin lamellar structure is transparent under transmission polarized optical microscopy. Such spatial molecular arrangements may be attributed to dimer molecular entities in the supercooled liquid Ga. The LC structure observation of electrically conductive liquid Ga can provide new opportunities in materials science and LC applications.

         <title>Rational Design of a High Performance and Robust Solar Evaporator via 3D&#8208;Printing Technology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 38, September 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rationally designed solar evaporator using a double&#8208;layered photoabsorber on a concave&#8208;shaped 3D&#8208;printed supporter improves the light&#8208;harvesting capacity by reutilizing reflected light and prevents salt deposition due to the hydrophobic upper layer of the photoabsorber; meanwhile, the hydrophilic bottom layer continuously pumps the water. As a result, the rationally designed solar evaporator exhibits an outstanding evaporation performance.








Abstract
Utilizing the broad&#8208;band solar spectrum for sea water desalination is a promising method that can provide fresh water without sophisticated infrastructures. However, the solar&#8208;to&#8208;vapour efficiency has been limited due to the lack of a proper design for the evaporator to deal with either a large amount of heat loss or salt accumulation. Here, these issues are addressed via two cost&#8208;effective approaches: I) a rational design of a concave shaped supporter by 3D&#8208;printing that can promote the light harvesting capacity via multiple reflections on the surface; II) the use of a double layered photoabsorber composed of a hydrophilic bottom layer of a polydopamine (PDA) coated glass fiber (GF/C) and a hydrophobic upper layer of a carbonized poly(vinyl alcohol)/polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVA/PVP) hydrogel on the supporter, which provides competitive benefit for preventing deposition of salt while quickly pumping the water. The 3D&#8208;printed solar evaporator can efficiently utilize solar energy (99%) with an evaporation rate of 1.60 kg m&#8211;2 h&#8211;1 and efficiency of 89% under 1 sun irradiation. The underlying reason for the high efficiency obtained is supported by the heat transfer mechanism. The 3D&#8208;printed solar evaporator could provide cheap drinking water in remote areas, while maintaining stable performance for a long term.

         <title>Confinement of Ultrasmall Bimetallic Nanoparticles in Conductive Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks via Site&#8208;Specific Nucleation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 38, September 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrasmall bimetallic nanoparticles (BNPs) are confined in pores of 2D conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (cMOFs). BNPs in cMOFs significantly improve the NO2&#8208;sensing performance, owing to the bimetallic synergies of PtRu NPs and the high surface area and porosity of the cMOF.








Abstract
Conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (cMOFs) are emerging materials for various applications due to their high surface area, high porosity, and electrical conductivity. However, it is still challenging to develop cMOFs having high surface reactivity and durability. Here, highly active and stable cMOF are presented via the confinement of bimetallic nanoparticles (BNPs) in the pores of a 2D cMOF, where the confinement is guided by dipolar&#8208;interaction&#8208;induced site&#8208;specific nucleation. Heterogeneous metal precursors are bound to the pores of 2D cMOFs by dipolar interactions, and the subsequent reduction produces ultrasmall (&#8776;1.54&#160;nm) and well&#8208;dispersed PtRu NPs confined in the pores of the cMOF. PtRu&#8208;NP&#8208;decorated cMOFs exhibit significantly enhanced chemiresistive NO2 sensing performances, owing to the bimetallic synergies of PtRu NPs and the high surface area and porosity of cMOF. The approach paves the way for the synthesis of highly active and conductive porous materials via bimetallic and/or multimetallic NP loading.

PtRu-NP-decorated cMOFs exhibit significantly enhanced chemiresistive NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sensing performances, owing to the bimetallic synergies of PtRu NPs and the high surface area and porosity of cMOF. The approach paves the way for the synthesis of highly active and conductive porous materials via bimetallic and/or multimetallic NP loading.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stabilizing Zinc Anodes by Regulating the Electrical Double Layer with Saccharin Anions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 38, September 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Saccharin is introduced as an electrolyte additive for building a H2O&#8208;poor electrical double layer (EDL) structure near the Zn metal surface. With the presence of this unique EDL structure, Zn symmetric cells display a high cumulative plating capacity of 2.75 Ah cm&#8722;2 and a high average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.6% under harsh test conditions (10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, 10 mAh cm&#8722;2).








Abstract
Zn anodes suffer from poor Coulombic efficiency (CE) and serious dendrite formation due to the unstable anode/electrolyte interface (AEI). The electrical double layer (EDL) structure formed before cycling is of great significance for building stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on Zn surface but barely discussed in previous research about the stabilization of Zn anode. Herein, saccharin (Sac) is introduced as electrolyte additive for regulating the EDL structure on the AEI. It is found that Sac derived anions are preferentially adsorbed on the Zn metal surface instead of water dipole, creating a new H2O&#8208;poor EDL structure. Moreover, the unique SEI is also detected on the Zn surface due to the decomposition of Sac anions. Both are proved to be capable of modulating Zn deposition behavior and preventing side reactions. Encouragingly, Zn|Zn symmetric cells using Sac additive deliver a high cumulative plated capacity of 2.75 Ah cm&#8722;2 and a high average CE of 99.6% under harsh test condition (10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, 10 mAh cm&#8722;2). The excellent stability is also achieved at a high rate of 40&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The effectiveness of this Sac additive is further demonstrated in the Zn&#8208;MnO2 full cells.

         <title>Metamorphosis of Heterostructured Surface&#8208;Mounted Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Yielding Record Oxygen Evolution Mass Activities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 38, September 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile strategy is developed to prepare highly active oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts by the in situ structural transformation and self&#8208;activation of heterostructured surface&#8208;mounted metal&#8211;organic frameworks (SURMOFs). This work enables access to a parameter space of metal&#8208;oxyhydroxide&#8208;type catalyst fabrication through the structural metamorphosis of SURMOFs.








Abstract
Materials derived from surface&#8208;mounted metal&#8211;organic frameworks (SURMOFs) are promising electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). A series of mixed&#8208;metal, heterostructured SURMOFs is fabricated by the facile layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer deposition method. The obtained materials reveal record&#8208;high electrocatalyst mass activities of &#8776;2.90 kA g&#8722;1 at an overpotential of 300&#160;mV in 0.1 m KOH, superior to the benchmarking precious and nonprecious metal electrocatalysts. This property is assigned to the particular in situ self&#8208;reconstruction and self&#8208;activation of the SURMOFs during the immersion and the electrochemical treatment in alkaline aqueous electrolytes, which allows for the generation of NiFe (oxy)hydroxide electrocatalyst materials of specific morphology and microstructure.

         <title>Hydrogen Passivation of M&#8211;N&#8211;C (M = Fe, Co) Catalysts for Storage Stability and ORR Activity Improvements</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 38, September 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The storage stability of M&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts is investigated. Surface oxidation and hydroxylation are found to be responsible for serious performance degradation after long&#8208;term storage in ambient environment. A hydrogen passivation strategy is proposed to modify and protect the catalytic active sites, which can greatly improve the storage stability as well as the fuel&#8208;cell activity and power density of the catalysts.








Abstract
M&#8211;N&#8211;C (M = Fe, Co) are highly active nonprecious metal electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and other applications. Although their operation stability has been extensively studied in proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cells, the storage stability that determines the performance maintenance before use has not yet been understood. Here, it is found that long&#8208;term exposure of M&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts in air would cause surface oxidation and hydroxylation, resulting in significant decrease of ORR activity and fuel&#8208;cell performances. Hydrogen passivation is demonstrated to be an effective strategy to protect the atomic M&#8211;N4 active sites and improve the storage stability of the catalysts. In addition, the hydrogen&#8208;termination can also reduce the ORR energy barrier and increase the utilization of active sites, leading to the improvements of fuel&#8208;cell activity and power density. Notably, these findings help to understand the storage&#8208;associated degradation and protection of M&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts.

         <title>Enhancing Thermoelectric Power Factor of 2D Organometal Halide Perovskites by Suppressing 2D/3D Phase Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 38, September 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reducing the dimension of the perovskite structure from 3D (MASnI3) to 2D [(PEA)2(MA)n&#8722;1SnnI3n+1 (n&#160;= 1, 2, 3, 4)] enables a facile control of carrier concentration and induces the quantum confinement effect. Both the Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity increase at an optimum n, which results in a high thermoelectric power factor of 111 &#181;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2.








Abstract
Organometal halide perovskites (OHPs) exhibit superior charge transport characteristics and ultralow thermal conductivities. However, thermoelectric (TE) applications of OHPs have been limited because of difficulties in controlling their carrier concentration, which is a key to optimizing their TE properties. Here, facile control of the carrier concentration in Sn&#8208;based OHPs is achieved by developing 2D crystal structures. The 2D OHP crystals are laterally oriented using a mixed solvent, and the morphology and crystal structure of the coexisting 2D/3D hybrid structures are systematically controlled via doping with methylammonium chloride. The effective number neff of inorganic octahedron layers in the 2D OHPs shows a strong positive correlation with the carrier concentration. Moreover, the 2D structure induces the quantum confinement effect, which enhances both the Seebeck coefficient and the electrical conductivity. A 2D OHP shows a high power factor of 111 &#181;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2, which is an order of magnitude greater than the power factor of its 3D counterpart.

         <title>Uranium In Situ Electrolytic Deposition with a Reusable Functional Graphene&#8208;Foam Electrode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 38, September 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reusable 3D functionalized reduced graphene oxide foam (3D&#8208;FrGOF) is used as an in situ electrolytic deposition electrode to extract uranium from contaminated water. The specific U(VI) extraction capacity is 4560&#160;mg g&#8722;1, and the Coulombic efficiency is 54%. Moreover, uranium in spiked seawater is reduced from 3&#160;ppm to less than 19.9 ppb (the US Environmental Protection Agency drinking water limit is 30 ppb).








Abstract
Nuclear fission produces 400 GWe which represents 11% of the global electricity output. Uranium is the essential element as both fission fuel and radioactive waste. Therefore, the recovery of uranium is of great importance. Here, an in situ electrolytic deposition method to extract uranium from aqueous solution is reported. A functionalized reduced graphene oxide foam (3D&#8208;FrGOF) is used as the working electrode, which acts as both a hydrogen evolution reaction catalyst and a uranium deposition substrate. The specific electrolytic deposition capacity for U(VI) ions with the 3D&#8208;FrGOF is 4560&#160;mg g&#8722;1 without reaching saturation, and the Coulombic efficiency can reach 54%. Moreover, reduction of the uranium concentration in spiked seawater from 3&#160;ppm to 19.9 ppb is achieved, which is lower than the US Environmental Protection Agency uranium limits for drinking water (30 ppb). Furthermore, the collection electrode can be efficiently regenerated and recycled at least nine times without much efficiency fading, by ejecting into 2000&#160;ppm concentrated uranium solution in a second bath with reverse voltage bias. All these findings open new opportunities in using free&#8208;standing 3D&#8208;FrGOF electrode as an advanced separation technique for water treatment.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Induced Modulation of Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance in Ultrathin Hexagonal Gold Nanoplates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 38, September 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monochromated electron energy&#8208;loss spectral maps reveal four distinct localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) components and intensity distributions of all LSPR modes in a hexagonal gold nanoplate (NPL). Strain maps provide experimental evidence that the tensile strain field induced by a Z&#8208;shaped faulted dipole is responsible for the asymmetric distribution of the LSPR intensity in a hexagonal gold NPL.








Abstract
Anisotropic gold nanoplates (NPLs) have raised the interesting possibility that their reduced geometrical symmetry allows fine tuning of their optical properties associated with the excitation of localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs). Recent developments have greatly improved LSPR tunability by utilizing the spatial distribution of LSPR modes. However, the nanoscale interplay between defect&#8208;induced mechanical strain and the spatial variation of LSPR modes remains poorly understood. In this work, the combination of high spatial&#8208; and spectral&#8208;resolution mapping of LSPR modes and nanoscale strain mapping using aberration&#8208;corrected transmission electron microscopy are applied to investigate the nanoscale distribution of LSPR modes in an ultrathin single hexagonal gold NPL and the effect of defect&#8208;induced strains on its LSPR properties. The electron energy&#8208;loss spectral maps reveal four distinct LSPR components and intensity distributions of all LSPR modes in a hexagonal gold NPL. Furthermore, the strain maps provide experimental evidence that the tensile strain field induced by a Z&#8208;shaped faulted dipole is responsible for the asymmetric distribution of LSPR intensity in a hexagonal gold NPL.

         <title>Low&#8208;Density Fluorinated Silane Solvent Enhancing Deep Cycle Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries&#8217; Lifetime</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 38, September 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of bifunctional fluorinated  silane&#8208;based electrolyte with a low density is proposed. This electrolyte can not only effectively reduce the electrolyte weight/cell capacity in lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S)  batteries, but also form a robust solid electrolyte interface to minimize lithium depletion. Hence, long&#8208;term&#8208;cycling Li&#8211;S pouch cells are obtained under lean&#8208; electrolyte and low lithium excess.








Abstract
The lithium metal anode (LMA) instability at deep cycle with high utilization is a crucial barrier for developing lithium (Li) metal batteries, resulting in excessive Li inventory and electrolyte demand. This issue becomes more severe in capacity&#8208;type lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries. High&#8208;concentration or localized high&#8208;concentration electrolytes are noted as effective strategies to stabilize Li metal but usually lead to a high electrolyte density (&gt;1.4&#160;g mL&#8722;1). Here we&#160;propose a bifunctional fluorinated silane&#8208;based electrolyte with a low density of 1.0&#160;g mL&#8722;1 that not only is much lighter than conventional electrolytes (&#8776;1.2&#160;g mL&#8722;1) but also form a robust solid electrolyte interface to minimize Li depletion. Therefore, the Li loss rate is reduced over 4.5&#8208;fold with the proposed electrolyte relative to its conventional counterpart. When paired with onefold excess LMA at the electrolyte weight/cell capacity (E/C) ratio of 4.5&#160;g Ah&#8722;1, the Li&#8211;S pouch cell using our&#160;electrolyte can survive for 103 cycles, much longer than with the conventional electrolyte (38 cycles). This demonstrates that our&#160;electrolyte not only reduces the E/C ratio but also enhances the cyclic stability of Li&#8211;S batteries under limited Li amounts.

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule Binding Assay Using Nanopores and Dimeric NP Conjugates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 38, September 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;molecule nanopore&#8208;based sensing strategy is developed to screen for biomarkers. In the presence of the target biomolecules, AuNPs dimerize and are detected electrically using a nanopore. This approach is highly sensitive and selective and can potentially be used for diagnosis and screening of diseases without the need for sample processing or amplification.








Abstract
The ability to measure biomarkers, both specifically and selectively at the single&#8208;molecule level in biological fluids, has the potential to transform the diagnosis, monitoring, and therapeutic intervention of diseases. The use of nanopores has been gaining prominence in this area, not only for sequencing but more recently in screening applications. The selectivity of nanopore sensing can be substantially improved with the use of labels, but substantial challenges remain, especially when trying to differentiate between bound from unbound targets. Here highly sensitive and selective molecular probes made from nanoparticles (NPs) that self&#8208;assemble and dimerize upon binding to a biological target are designed. It is shown that both single and paired NPs can be successfully resolved and detected at the single&#8208;molecule nanopore sensing and can be used for applications such as antigen/antibody detection and microRNA (miRNA) sequence analysis. It is expected that such technology will contribute significantly to developing highly sensitive and selective strategies for the diagnosis and screening of diseases without the need for sample processing or amplification while requiring minimal sample volume.

         <title>Antisolvent Engineering to Optimize Grain Crystallinity and Hole&#8208;Blocking Capability of Perovskite Films for High&#8208;Performance Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 38, September 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,3,5&#8208;Tris(1&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzene (TPBi) is introduced via an antisolvent engineering to regulate the growth of perovskite film. Upon the incorporation of TPBi, the perovskite film obtains a higher crystallinity and enhanced hole blocking capability on the surface. The TPBi&#8208;incorporated perovskite solar cell delivers a high efficiency of 21.79% and keeps &#8776;92% of the initial value after 1000 h in the ambient atmosphere.








Abstract
With potential commercial applications, inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have received wide&#8208;spread attentions as they are compatible with tandem devices and processed at low&#8208;temperature. Nevertheless, their efficiencies remain unsatisfactory due to insufficient film quality on hydrophobic hole transport layer and limited hole&#8208;blocking capability of the electron transport layer. Herein, 1,3,5&#8208;Tris(1&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzene (TPBi), an n&#8208;type semiconductor, is incorporated into the antisolvent to simultaneously regulate the grain growth and charge transport of perovskite films. TPBi facilitates the crystallization of perovskites along (100) orientation.

&lt;p&gt;1,3,5-Tris(1-phenyl-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)benzene (TPBi) is introduced via an antisolvent engineering to regulate the growth of perovskite film. Upon the incorporation of TPBi, the perovskite film obtains a higher crystallinity and enhanced hole blocking capability on the surface. The TPBi-incorporated perovskite solar cell delivers a high efficiency of 21.79% and keeps &#8776;92% of the initial value after 1000 h in the ambient atmosphere.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With potential commercial applications, inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have received wide-spread attentions as they are compatible with tandem devices and processed at low-temperature. Nevertheless, their efficiencies remain unsatisfactory due to insufficient film quality on hydrophobic hole transport layer and limited hole-blocking capability of the electron transport layer. Herein, 1,3,5-Tris(1-phenyl-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)benzene (TPBi), an n-type semiconductor, is incorporated into the antisolvent to simultaneously regulate the grain growth and charge transport of perovskite films. TPBi facilitates the crystallization of perovskites along (100) orientation. Besides, TPBi is mainly distributed near the top surface of perovskite film and enhances the hole-blocking capability of the area adjacent to the surface. The superior properties of this film lead to a remarkable improvement in the open-circuit voltage of inverted PSCs. The champion device achieves a high power conversion efficiency of 21.79% while keeping &#8776;92% of its initial value after 1000 h storage in the ambient atmosphere. This work provides an effective way to evidently promote the performance of inverted PSCs and illustrates its underlaying mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bio&#8208;Organic Chiral Nematic Materials with Adaptive Light Emission and On&#8208;Demand Handedness</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 38, September 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust and flexible chiral emissive bio&#8208;nanocomposite with chiral nematic&#8208;like organization that mimics the biological photonic mesostructure observed in nature are demonstrated. Small molecules built in chiral mesostructure are assembled along helical arrangement, allowing the generation of strong active circularly polarized light emission. Real&#8208;time phase transition of the molecules integrated into the biophotonic structure enables highly asymmetric circularly polarized light emission with on&#8208;demand handedness.








Abstract
Real&#8208;time active control of the handedness of circularly polarized light emission requires sophisticated manufacturing and structural reconfigurations of inorganic optical components that can rarely be achieved in traditional passive optical structures. Here, robust and flexible emissive optically&#8208;doped biophotonic materials that facilitate the dynamic optical activity are reported. These optically active bio&#8208;enabled materials with a chiral nematic&#8208;like organization of cellulose nanocrystals with intercalated organic dye generated strong circularly polarized photoluminescence with a high asymmetric factor. Reversible phase&#8208;shifting of the photochromic molecules intercalated into chiral nematic organization enables alternating circularly polarized light emission with on&#8208;demand handedness. Real&#8208;time alternating handedness can be triggered by either remote light illumination or changes in the acidic environment. This unique dynamic chiro&#8208;optical behavior presents an efficient way to design emissive bio&#8208;derived materials for dynamic programmable active photonic materials for optical communication, optical coding, visual protection, and visual adaptation.

         <title>Selective Catalysis Remedies Polysulfide Shuttling in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>

Selective catalysis is proposed as a fundamental remedy for consecutive solid&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid sulfur redox reactions. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept In&#8208;based catalyst targetedly decelerates the solid&#8211;liquid  conversion, dissolution of elemental  sulfur to polysulfides, while accelerating the liquid&#8211;solid conversion, deposition of polysulfides into insoluble Li2S, which basically reduces accumulation of polysulfides in the electrolyte, finally inhibiting the shuttle effect in Li&#8211;S batteries.








Abstract
The shuttling of soluble lithium polysulfides between the electrodes leads to serious capacity fading and excess use of electrolyte, which severely bottlenecks practical use of Li&#8208;S batteries. Here, selective catalysis is proposed as a fundamental remedy for the consecutive solid&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid sulfur redox reactions. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept Indium (In)&#8208;based catalyst targetedly decelerates the solid&#8208;liquid conversion, dissolution of elemental sulfur to polysulfides, while accelerates the liquid&#8208;solid conversion, deposition of polysulfides into insoluble Li2S, which basically reduces accumulation of polysulfides in electrolyte, finally inhibiting the shuttle effect. The selective catalysis is revealed, experimentally and theoretically, by changes of activation energies and kinetic currents, modified reaction pathway together with the probed dynamically changing catalyst (LiInS2 catalyst), and gradual deactivation of the In&#8208;based catalyst. The In&#8208;based battery works steadily over 1000 cycles at 4.0 C and yields an initial areal capacity up to 9.4 mAh cm&#8722;2 with a sulfur loading of &#8776;9.0 mg cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Photochemical Synthesis of Nonplanar Small Molecules with Ultrafast Nonradiative Decay for Highly Efficient Phototheranostics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 38, September 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile photochemical reaction is utilized to synthesize organic photothermal agents. Through this reaction, highly nonplanar small molecules (NSMs) containing Michler's base donors and a tricyanoquinodimethane acceptor are rationally designed and synthesized in high yields. The assembled nanoparticles (NSMN) with ultrafast nonradiative decay achieve effective in vivo photoacoustic imaging and photothermal therapy against tumor.








Abstract
There has been much recent progress in the development of photothermal agents (PTAs) for biomedical and energy applications. Synthesis of organic PTAs typically involves noble metal catalysts and high temperatures. On the other hand, photochemical synthesis, as an alternative and green chemical technology, has obvious merits such as low cost, energy efficiency, and high yields. However, photochemical reactions have rarely been employed for the synthesis of PTAs. Herein, a facile and high&#8208;yield photochemical reaction is exploited for synthesizing nonplanar small molecules (NSMs) containing strong Michler's base donors and a tricyanoquinodimethane acceptor as high&#8208;performance PTAs. The synthesized NSMs show interesting photophysical properties including good absorption for photons of over 1000&#160;nm wavelength, high near&#8208;infrared extinction coefficients, and excellent photothermal performance. Upon assembling the NSMs into nanoparticles (NSMN), they exhibit good biocompatibility, high photostability, and excellent photothermal conversion efficiency of 75%. Excited&#8208;state dynamic studies reveal that the NSMN has ultrafast nonradiative decay after photoexcitation. With these unique properties, the NSMN achieves efficient in vivo photoacoustic imaging and photothermal tumor ablation. This work demonstrates the superior potential of photochemical reactions for the synthesis of high&#8208;performance molecular PTAs.

         <title>Chiral Plasmonic Triangular Nanorings with SERS Activity for Ultrasensitive Detection of Amyloid Proteins in Alzheimer's Disease</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 38, September 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral Pt@Au triangular nanorings with intense optical activity are fabricated to detect amyloid proteins in Alzheimer's disease. This work opens up an avenue to use chiral plasmonic nanomaterials as ultrasensitive surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrates to early diagnosis of protein&#8208;misfolding diseases.








Abstract
Chiral plasmonic nanomaterials have attracted unprecedented attention due to their broad applications in biomedicine, negative refractive index, and chiral sensing. Here, using a wet&#8208;chemistry process, chiral triangular Au nanorings are fabricated with a platinum (Pt) framework (l/d&#8208;Pt@Au triangular nanorings, named l/d&#8208;Pt@Au TNRs). The l/d&#8208;Pt@Au TNRs exhibit strong optical activity with a g&#8208;factor of 0.023 and can be used effectively for the discrimination of enantiomers due to selective resonance coupling between the induced electric and magnetic dipoles associated with enantiomers and the chiral plasmonic TNRs, also known as the surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering&#8208;chiral anisotropy (SERS&#8208;ChA) effect. The chiral d&#8208;Pt@Au TNRs represent a label&#8208;free SERS platform that can be applied to detect A&#946; monomers and fibrils, the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD), achieving a limit of detection (LOD) down to 0.045 &#215; 10&#8722;12 m and 4 &#215; 10&#8722;15 m for 42&#8208;residue&#8208;long amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;42) monomer and fibrils, respectively. Furthermore, chiral d&#8208;Pt@Au TNRs can also be successfully carried out to detect A&#946;42 proteins in AD patients with ultrahigh levels of sensitivity, thus allowing picogram quantities of A&#946;42 proteins to be identified. This research opens up an avenue for the use of chiral plasmonic nanomaterials as ultrasensitive SERS substrates to early diagnosis of protein&#8208;misfolding diseases.

&lt;/i&gt;-Pt@Au TNRs can also be successfully carried out to detect A&#946;&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt; proteins in AD patients with ultrahigh levels of sensitivity, thus allowing picogram quantities of A&#946;&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt; proteins to be identified. This research opens up an avenue for the use of chiral plasmonic nanomaterials as ultrasensitive SERS substrates to early diagnosis of protein-misfolding diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Quantitative In Situ Visualization of Thermal Effects on the Formation of Gold Nanocrystals in Solution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 38, September 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
How temperature affects the formation of gold nanoparticles in water is revealed by liquid&#8208;phase transmission electron microscopy. Thermal effects on the nucleation and growth rates of the colloidal assemblies match with the classical models for nanoparticle formation but the direct observation of single nanoparticle dynamics provides new in situ insights into the atomic&#8208;scale mechanisms governing the size and shape of nanostructures.








Abstract
Understanding temperature effects in nanochemistry requires real&#8208;time in situ measurements because this key parameter of wet&#8208;chemical synthesis simultaneously influences the kinetics of chemical reactions and the thermodynamic equilibrium of nanomaterials in solution. Here, temperature&#8208;controlled liquid cell transmission electron microscopy is exploited to directly image the radiolysis&#8208;driven formation of gold nanoparticles between 25 &#176;C and 85 &#176;C and provide a deeper understanding of the atomic&#8208;scale processes determining the size and shape of gold colloids. By quantitatively comparing the nucleation and growth rates of colloidal assemblies with classical models for nanocrystal formation, it is shown that the increase of the molecular diffusion and the solubility of gold governs the drastic changes in the formation dynamics of nanostructures in solution with temperature. In contraction with the common view of coarsening processes in solution, it is also demonstrated that the dissolution of nanoparticles and thus the Ostwald ripening is not only driven by size effects. Furthermore, visualizing thermal effects on faceting processes at the single nanoparticle level reveals how the competition between the growth speed and the surface diffusion dictates the final shape of nanocrystals.

         <title>Reducing Water Activity by Zeolite Molecular Sieve Membrane for Long&#8208;Life Rechargeable Zinc Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 38, September 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A zeolite molecular sieve is demonstrated to reduce water activity and is employed for a high&#8208;performance zinc anode. Spectroscopy and simulation characterizations identify that the  zeolite&#8208;molecular&#8208;sieve&#8208;modified electrolyte renders a highly aggressive solvation sheath and restrains the activity of water molecules. Benefitting from the regulation, the fabricated zinc anode demon strates a compact deposition and superior stability with less side&#8208;product generation.








Abstract
Aqueous electrolytes offer major advantages in safe battery operation, green economy, and low production cost for advanced battery technology. However, strong water activity in aqueous electrolytes provokes a hydrogen evolution reaction and parasitic passivation on electrodes, leaving poor ion&#8208;transport in the electrolyte/electrode interface. Herein, a zeolite molecular sieve&#8208;modified (zeolite&#8208;modified) aqueous electrolyte is proposed to reduce water activity and its side&#8208;reaction. First, Raman spectroscopy reveals a highly aggressive solvation configuration and significantly suppressed water activity toward single water molecule. Then less hydrogen evolution and anti&#8208;corrosion ability of zeolite&#8208;modified electrolyte by simulation and electrochemical characterizations are identified. Consequently, a zinc (Zn) anode involves less side&#8208;reaction, and develops into a compact deposition morphology, as proved by space&#8208;resolution characterizations. Moreover, zeolite&#8208;modified electrolyte favors cyclic life of symmetric Zn||Zn cells to 4765 h at 0.8&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, zinc&#8208;VO2 coin cell to 3000 cycles, and pouch cell to 100 cycles. Finally, the mature production technique and low&#8208;cost of zeolite molecular sieve would tremendously favor the future scale&#8208;up application in engineering aspect.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Anisotropic Janus Silicon Quantum Dots via Masking on 2D Silicon Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 38, September 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;faced &#8220;Janus&#8221; silicon quantum dots (QDs) are synthesized by using silicon nanosheets as a sacrificial mask. The method exploits the photosensitivity of the mask and the photoreactivity of the QDs to introduce two different functional groups on either side. The characteristic optoelectronic properties remain unaffected while the two&#8208;sided nature imparts new unique properties such as self&#8208;assembly and monolayer formation.








Abstract
Surface&#8208;anisotropic nanoparticles represent a new class of materials that shows potential in a variety of applications, including self&#8208;assembly, microelectronics, and biology. Here, the first synthesis of surface&#8208;anisotropic silicon quantum dots (SiQDs), obtained through masking on 2D silicon nanosheets, is presented. SiQDs are deposited on the 2D substrate, thereby exposing only one side of the QDs, which is functionalized through well&#8208;established hydrosilylation procedures. The UV&#8208;sensitive masking substrate is removed through UV&#8208;irradiation, which simultaneously initiates the hydrosilylation of a second substrate, thereby introducing a second functional group to the other side of the now free&#8208;standing SiQDs. This renders surface&#8208;anisotropic SiQDs that have two different functional groups on either side of the particle. This method can be used to introduce a variety of functional groups including hydrophilic and hydrophobic substrates, while the unique optoelectronic properties of the SiQDs remain unaffected. The anisotropic morphology of the QDs is confirmed through the aggregation behavior of amphiphilic Janus SiQDs at the interface of water and hexane. Additionally, anisotropic SiQDs are used to produce the first controlled (sub)monolayer of SiQDs on a gold wafer.

         <title>Electro&#8208;Blown Spun Silk/Graphene Nanoionotronic Skin for Multifunctional Fire Protection and Alarm</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 38, September 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flame&#8208;retardant silk/graphene nanoionotronic (SGNI) skin with sensitive fire alarm property is fabricated using electro&#8208;blown spinning. The SGNI skin adheres to the target surface and serves as an alarm. Once exposed to fire, the SGNI skin senses the fire source and quickly sends an alarm to the control center and a cell phone.








Abstract
Artificial protective skins are widely used in artificial intelligence robots, such as humanoid robots, mobile manipulation robots, and automatic probe robots, but their safety in use, especially flame retardancy, is rarely considered. As many artificial skins are designed for use in flammable or even explosive environments, flammability is a significant concern. Herein, a flame&#8208;retardant silk/graphene nanoionotronic (SGNI) skin is developed by using a rationally designed high&#8208;throughput electro&#8208;blown spinning technique, with a more efficient production efficiency than electrospinning. These flame retardant SGNI skins combine the advantages of nanofibrous and ionotronic materials, and they are sustainable, conductive, highly porous, mechanically robust, highly stretchable, self&#8208;adhesive, and humidity&#8208; and temperature&#8208;sensitive. These merits support the assembly of SGNI skins into a fire alarm system, with real&#8208;time alarm (response in 2 s) to mobile phones, clouds, and a central control system. The concept that combines a flame retardant and fire alarm material into an intelligent skin may provide potential solutions toward the design of protective skins for robotics and human&#8211;machine interactions.

A highly sensitive and robust cutaneous ionogel mechanoreceptor is proposed through facile manufacturing methods. The hydrogel&#8208;based hierarchical architecture harnesses the ultracapacitive mechanism to achieve enhanced pressure&#8208;sensing functionality with high bandwidth and sensitivity. This scalable touch skin can provide tactile sensing for soft machines, physiological signal monitoring, industrial robots, and amputee prostheses.








Abstract
Touch sensing has a central role in robotic grasping and emerging human&#8211;machine interfaces for robot&#8208;assisted prosthetics. Although advancements in soft conductive polymers have promoted the creation of diverse pressure sensors, these sensors are difficult to be employed as touch skins for robotics and prostheses due to their limited sensitivity, narrow pressure range, and complex structure and fabrication process. Here, a highly sensitive and robust soft touch skin is presented with ultracapacitive sensing that combines ionic hydrogels with commercially available conductive fabrics. Prototypical designs of the capacitive sensors through facile manufacturing methods are introduced and a high sensitivity up to 1.5 kPa&#8722;1 (&#8776;44 times higher than conventional parallel&#8208;plate capacitive counterparts), a broad pressure detection range of over four orders of magnitudes (&#8776;35&#160;Pa to 330&#160;kPa), ultrahigh baseline of capacitance, fast response time (&#8776;18&#160;ms), and good repeatability are demonstrated. Ionogel skins composed of an array of cutaneous mechanoreceptors capable of monitoring various physiological signals and shape detection are further developed. The touch skin can be integrated within a soft bionic hand and provide an industrial robot and an amputee with robust tactile feedback when handling delicate objects, illustrating its potential applications in next&#8208;generation human&#8208;in&#8208;the&#8208;loop robotic systems with tactile sensing.

         <title>A First Wide&#8208;Open LDH Structure Hosting InP/ZnS QDs: A New Route Toward Efficient and Photostable Red&#8208;Emitting Phosphor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 38, September 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
InP/ZnS quantum dots (QDs) embedded into a bola layered&#8208;double&#8208;hydroxide (LDH) host structure exhibit photoluminescence properties surpassing those of the pristine QD powder. Incorporated into silicone, this new hybrid phosphor results in a homogeneous and highly saturated red&#8208;emitting film with good photonic stability, suitable for high color rendering index (CRI) LED lighting.








Abstract
The architecture of Zn&#8208;Al layered double hydroxides (LDHs), organo&#8208;modified with bola&#8208;amphiphiles molecules, is matching its interlayer space to the size of narrow&#8208;band red&#8208;emitting InP/ZnS core&#8211;shell quantum dots (QDs) to form original high&#8208;performance functional organic&#8211;inorganic QD&#8208;bola&#8208;LDH hybrids. The success of size&#8208;matching interlayer space (SMIS) approach is confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction, small angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS), TEM, STEM&#8208;HAADF, and photoluminescence investigations. The QD&#8208;Bola&#8208;LDH hybrid exhibits a photoluminescence quantum yield three times higher than that of pristine InP/ZnS QDs and provides an easy dispersion into silicone&#8208;based resins, what makes the SMIS approach a change of paradigm compared to intercalation chemistry using common host structures. Moreover, this novel hybrid presents low QD&#8211;QD energy transfer comparable to that obtained for QDs in suspension. Composite silicone films incorporating InP/ZnS (0.27&#160;wt%) QD&#8208;bola&#8208;LDH hybrids further show remarkable improved photostability relative to pristine QDs. An LED overlay consisting of a blue LED chip and silicone films loaded with QD&#8208;bola&#8208;LDH hybrids and YAG:Ce phosphors exhibits a color rendering index close to 94.

         <title>Design of Highly Durable Core&#8722;Shell Catalysts by Controlling Shell Distribution Guided by In&#8208;Situ Corrosion Study</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 38, September 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ liquid cell transmission electron microscopy observation is demonstrated as being able to guide the design of highly durable electrocatalysts, which is further verified by in situ corrosion and practical cyclic voltammetry measurements with the loss of 0.37% and 9.01% in specific and mass activities toward the oxygen reduction reaction.








Abstract
Most degradations in electrocatalysis are caused by corrosion in operation, for example the corrosion of the core in a core&#8722;shell electrocatalyst during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein, according to the in&#8208;situ study on nanoscale corrosion kinetics via liquid cell transmission electron microscopy (LC&#8208;TEM) in the authors&#8217; previous work, they sequentially designed an optimized nanocube with the protection of more layers on the corners by adjusting the Pt atom distribution on corners and terraces. This modified nanocube (MNC) is much more corrosion resistant in the in&#8208;situ observation. Furthermore, in the practical electrochemical stability testing, the MNC catalyst also showed the best stability performance with the 0.37% and 9.01% loss in specific and mass activity after 30&#8201;000 cycles accelerated durability test (ADT). This work also demonstrates that how an in&#8208;situ study can guide the design of desired materials with improved properties and build a bridge between in&#8208;situ study and practical application.

         <title>Electrolyte Design Enabling a High&#8208;Safety and High&#8208;Performance Si Anode with a Tailored Electrode&#8211;Electrolyte Interphase</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 38, September 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nonflammable and ether&#8208;based electrolyte is formulated, enabling a highly stabilized Si anode and a LiNi0.5Mn0.3Co0.2O2 (NMC532) cathode. The high reversible capacity of the Si electrode is retained at 2041.9 mAh g&#8722;1 after 200 cycles, with a capacity fading rate of 0.0615% per cycle. A full cell coupling unmodified Si with a commercial NMC532 cathode demonstrates cycle life to 60 cycles.








Abstract
Silicon (Si) anodes are advantageous for application in lithium&#8208;ion batteries in terms of their high theoretical capacity (4200 mAh g&#8722;1), appropriate operating voltage (&lt;0.4&#160;V vs Li/Li+), and earth&#8208;abundancy. Nevertheless, a large volume change of Si particles emerges with cycling, triggering unceasing breakage/re&#8208;formation of the solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) and thereby the fast capacity degradation in traditional carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes. Herein, it is demonstrated that superior cyclability of Si anode is achievable using a nonflammable ether&#8208;based electrolyte with fluoroethylene carbonate and lithium oxalyldifluoroborate dual additives. By forming a high&#8208;modulus SEI rich in fluoride (F) and boron (B) species, a high initial Coulombic efficiency of 90.2% is attained in Si/Li cells, accompanied with a low capacity&#8208;fading rate of only 0.0615% per cycle (discharge capacity of 2041.9 mAh g&#8722;1 after 200 cycles). Full cells pairing the unmodified Si anode with commercial LiFePO4 (&#8776;13.92&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) and LiNi0.5Mn0.3Co0.2O2 (&#8776;17.9&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) cathodes further show extended service life to 150 and 60 cycles, respectively, demonstrating the superior cathode&#8208;compatibility realized with a thin and F, B&#8208;rich cathode electrolyte interface. This work offers an easily scalable approach in developing high&#8208;performance Si&#8208;based batteries through Si/electrolyte interphase regulation.

         <title>Ambipolar Channel p&#8208;TMD/n&#8208;Ga2O3 Junction Field Effect Transistors and High Speed Photo&#8208;sensing in TMD Channel</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 38, September 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly crystalline 2D/3D&#8208;mixed p&#8208;TMD/n&#8208;Ga2O3 heterojunction devices are fabricated by mechanical exfoliation of each p&#8208; and n&#8208;type material, to finally realize ambipolar channel junction field&#8208;effect transistors (JFETs) as well as PN diodes. For more extended applications, p&#8208;TMD channel JFETs are used to sense visible or NIR photons through the &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 at high speed.








Abstract
Highly crystalline 2D/3D&#8208;mixed p&#8208;transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD)/n&#8208;Ga2O3 heterojunction devices are fabricated by mechanical exfoliation of each p&#8208; and n&#8208;type material. N&#8208;type &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 and p&#8208;type TMD separately play as a channel for junction field effect transistors (JFETs) with each type of carriers as well as materials for a heterojunction PN diode. The work thus mainly focuses on such ambipolar channel transistors with two different types of channel in a single device architecture. For more extended applications, the transparency of high energy band gap &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 (Eg&#160;&#8776; 4.8&#160;eV) is taken advantage of, firstly to measure the electrical energy gap of p&#8208;TMDs receiving visible or near infrared (NIR) photons through the &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3. Next, the p&#8208;TMD/n&#8208;Ga2O3 JFETs are put to high speed photo&#8208;sensing which is achieved from the p&#8208;TMD channel under reverse bias voltages on n&#8208;Ga2O3. The photo&#8208;switching cutoff frequency appears to be &#8776;16 and 29&#160;kHz for visible red and NIR illuminations, respectively, on the basis of &#8722;3&#160;dB photoelectric power loss. Such a high switching speed of the JFET is attributed to the fast transport of photo&#8208;carriers in TMD channels. The 2D/3D&#8208;mixed ambipolar channel JFETs and their photo&#8208;sensing applications are regarded novel, promising, and practically easy to achieve.

         <title>Spectroscopic Perception of Trap States on the Performance of Methylammonium and Formamidinium Lead Iodide Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 38, September 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsic mechanisms of doping effects on improving or decreasing the efficiency of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite (OIHP) solar cells are qualitatively and quantitatively clarified. The influences of the doping concentration, defects, trap density, and carrier mobility on the parameters (JSC, VOC, fill factor, and power conversion efficiency) of OIHP solar cells are identified by means of spectroscopic investigations.








Abstract
To enhance the efficiency and stability of the organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite (OIHP) solar cells, doping has been demonstrated as a straightforward method. Nevertheless, the perception of trap states regulated by doping and their effects on the performance of solar cells is not in&#8208;depth. Herein, typical OIHPs (CH3NH3PbI3 and Cs0.05FA0.85MA0.10Pb(I0.97Br0.03)3) doped with RbI are employed to expound the doping mechanism in affecting the efficiency of devices. Systematic spectroscopic characterizations indicate that doping significantly influences the photocarrier dynamics via directly regulating the trap states. The results indicate that doping would reduce the trap density by passivating defects and induce extra trapping centers. This directly manipulates the transient transport of the photocarriers and finally influences the output of devices. The optimization of solar cell performance requires the tradeoff of competitive relation between the passivation and introduction of trapping centers. The results provide the spectroscopic perception on how doping concentration affects trap density, carrier dynamics, transport behavior, and ultimately the parameters of devices. It provides a straightforward guidance to the design and optimization of OIHP&#8208;based solar cells.

         <title>Simultaneous Manipulation of Bulk Excitons and Surface Defects for Ultrastable and Highly Selective CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 38, September 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inventive molten strategy is used to synthesize homogeneously B&#8208;doped BiOCl nanosheets. Bulk B mitigates the strong excitonic effect confined in 2D BiOCl, whereas surface B induces a reactive B&#8208;OV associate for CO2 activation. The simultaneous tailoring of bulk excitons and surface defects enables ultrastable and highly selective CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO photoreduction in pure water.








Abstract
The objective of photocatalytic CO2 reduction (PCR) is to achieve high selectivity for a single energy&#8208;bearing product with high efficiency and stability. The bulk configuration usually determines charge carrier kinetics, whereas surface atomic arrangement defines the PCR thermodynamic pathway. Concurrent engineering of bulk and surface structures is therefore crucial for achieving the goal of PCR. Herein, an ultrastable and highly selective PCR using homogeneously doped BiOCl nanosheets synthesized via an inventive molten strategy is presented. With B2O3 as both the molten salt and doping precursor, this new doping approach ensures boron (B) doping from the surface into the bulk with dual functionalities. Bulk B doping mitigates strong excitonic effects confined in 2D BiOCl by significantly reducing exciton binding energies, whereas surface&#8208;doped B atoms reconstruct the BiOCl surface by extracting lattice hydroxyl groups, resulting in intimate B&#8208;oxygen vacancy (B&#8208;OV) associates. These exclusive B&#8208;OV associates enable spontaneous CO2 activation, suppress competitive hydrogen evolution and promote the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer step by stabilizing *COOH for selective CO generation. As a result, the homogeneous B&#8208;doped BiOCl nanosheets exhibit 98% selectivity for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO reduction under visible light, with an impressive rate of 83.64&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and ultrastability for long&#8208;term testing of 120 h.

         <title>A Universal Strategy toward the Precise Regulation of Initial Coulombic Efficiency of Li&#8208;Rich Mn&#8208;Based Cathode Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 38, September 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introduced cation/anion double defects can reduce the interface charge transfer resistance and enhance the Li+ ion diffusion coefficient. The induced in situ surface reconstruction layer can increase the electronic conductivity and stabilize the surface lattice oxygen. As a result, the initial Coulombic efficiency of Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based cathode material is controlled precisely.








Abstract
Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based cathode materials (LRMs) are potential cathode materials for high energy density lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) severely hinders the commercialization of LRM. Herein, a facile oleic acid&#8208;assisted interface engineering is put forward to precisely control the ICE, enhance reversible capacity and rate performance of LRM effectively. As a result, the ICE of LRM can be precisely adjusted from 84.1% to 100.7%, and a very high specific capacity of 330 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 C, as well as outstanding rate capability with a fascinating specific capacity of 250 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 C, are harvested. Theoretical calculations reveal that the introduced cation/anion double defects can reduce the diffusion barrier of Li+ ions, and in situ surface reconstruction layer can induce a self&#8208;built&#8208;in electric field to stabilize the surface lattice oxygen. Moreover, this facile interface engineering is universal and can enhance the ICEs of other kinds of LRM effectively. This work provides a valuable new idea for improving the comprehensive electrochemical performance of LRM through multistrategy collaborative interface engineering technology.

         <title>Out&#8208;Of&#8208;Plane Ordered Laminate Borides and Their 2D Ti&#8208;Based Derivative from Chemical Exfoliation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 38, September 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Out&#8208;of&#8208;plane chemical order in layered T2 phase Ti4MoSiB2 (o&#8208;MAB) is theoretically predicted and experimentally verified. Chemical exfoliation of the compound is shown by derivation of a 2D material, TiOxCly. The 2D sheets have a direct bandgap of &#8776;4.1&#160;eV and display characteristics suitable for supercapacitor applications.








Abstract
Exploratory theoretical predictions in uncharted structural and compositional space are integral to materials discoveries. Inspired by M5SiB2 (T2) phases, the finding of a family of laminated quaternary metal borides, M&#8242;4M&#8243;SiB2, with out&#8208;of&#8208;plane chemical order is reported here. 11 chemically ordered phases as well as 40 solid solutions, introducing four elements previously not observed in these borides are predicted. The predictions are experimentally verified for Ti4MoSiB2, establishing Ti as part of the T2 boride compositional space. Chemical exfoliation of Ti4MoSiB2 and select removal of Si and MoB2 sub&#8208;layers is validated by derivation of a 2D material, TiOxCly, of high yield and in the form of delaminated sheets. These sheets have an experimentally determined direct band gap of &#8776;4.1&#160;eV, and display characteristics suitable for supercapacitor applications. The results take the concept of chemical exfoliation beyond currently available 2D materials, and expands the envelope of 3D and 2D candidates, and their applications.

         <title>Superfast Water Transport Zwitterionic Polymeric Nanofluidic Membrane Reinforced by Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 38, September 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rigid&#8208;scaffold&#8208;reinforced polymeric nanoparticles&#8217; interfacial channel strategy is proposed for fabricating nanofluidic membranes that exhibit water permeance and dye/salt selectivity that are 1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude higher than conventional polymeric membranes. The unprecedented separation performance is due to the paradigm shift of water transport from conventional viscous flow to ultrafast nanofluidic flow in the membrane nanofluidics.








Abstract
Nanofluidics derived from low&#8208;dimensional nanosheets and protein nanochannels are crucial for advanced catalysis, sensing, and separation. However, polymer nanofluidics is halted by complicated preparation and miniaturized sizes. This work reports the bottom&#8208;up synthesis of modular nanofluidics by confined growth of ultrathin metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) in a polymer membrane consisting of zwitterionic dopamine nanoparticles (ZNPs). The confined growth of the MOFs on the ZNPs reduces the chain entanglement between the ZNPs, leading to stiff interfacial channels enhancing the nanofluidic transport of water molecules through the membrane. As such, the water permeability and solute selectivity of MOF@ZNPM are one magnitude improved, leading to a record&#8208;high performance among all polymer nanofiltration membranes. Both the experimental work and the molecular dynamics simulations confirm that the water transport is shifted from high&#8208;friction&#8208;resistance conventional viscous flow to ultrafast nanofluidic flow as a result of rigid and continuous nanochannels in MOF@ZNPM.

         <title>Efficient Blue Light Emitting Diodes Based On Europium Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 38, September 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ideal blue&#8208;light&#8208;emitting materials should simultaneously achieve narrow emission linewidth, suitable Commission Internationale de I'Eclairage color coordinate, excellent stability, good manufacturing compatibility, as well as non&#8208;toxic composition, which are rarely observed in previously reported materials. The design of robust and efficient lanthanide&#8208;based halide perovskites CsEuBr3 offers one possible solution for this long&#8208;standing challenge.








Abstract
Flat panel displays enjoy 100 billion&#8208;dollar markets with significant penetration in daily life, which require efficient, color&#8208;saturated blue, green, and red light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). The recently emerged halide perovskites have demonstrated low&#8208;cost and outstanding performance for potential LED applications. However, the performance of blue perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs) lags far behind red and green cousins, particularly for color coordinates approaching (0.131, 0.046) that fulfill the Rec. 2020 specification for blue emitters. Here, a high&#8208;efficiency, lead&#8208;free perovskite, CsEuBr3, is reported that exhibits bright blue exciton emission centered at 448&#160;nm with a color coordinates of (0.15, 0.04), contributed from Eu&#8208;5d&#8594;Eu&#8208;4f/Br&#8208;4p transition with an optical band gap of 2.85&#160;eV. Further optical characterizations reveal its short excited&#8208;state lifetime of 151&#160;ns, excellent exciton diffusion diffusivity of 0.0227 cm2 s&#8722;1, and high quantum yield of &#8776;69%. Inspired by these findings, deep&#8208;blue PeLEDs based on all&#8208;vacuum processing methods, which have been demonstrated as the most successful approach for the organic LED industry, are constructed. The devices show a maximum external quantum efficiency of 6.5% with an operating half&#8208;lifetime of 50 mins at an initial brightness of 15.9&#160;cd m&#8722;2. It is anticipated that this work will inspire further research on lanthanide&#8208;based perovskites for next&#8208;generation LED applications.

Light&#8208;Emitting Materials
In article number 2103411, Damien Boyer, Fabrice Leroux, and co&#8208;workers, report a new elegant method adapted from host&#8211;guest chemistry; the so&#8208;called &#8220;size&#8208;matching of the interlamellar space&#8221; (SMIS) is of particular interest in accommodating cumbersome, optically active, and fragile entities such as InP/ZnS quantum dots (QDs) within a wide&#8208;spread 2D host. The bi&#8208;termini telechelic&#8208;spacer&#8208;based QD&#8211;bola layered double hydoxide hybrid assembly yields highly homogeneous and saturated red&#8208;emitting films with high photonic stability.

Quantum Dots
In article number 2100288, Marc Julian Kloberg, Bernhard Rieger, and co&#8208;workers deposit quantum dots onto a 2D substrate (honeycomb lattice with buckling), which, upon irradiation with light, are released from  the surface while the underlying substrate is destroyed. The final product is Janus particles with two chemically different faces.

Solar Evaporators
In article number 2102649, Ji&#8208;Hyun Jang and co&#8208;workers present a 3D&#8208;printed solar evaporator that can efficiently utilize solar energy (99%) with an evaporation rate of 1.60 kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 and efficiency of 89% under 1 sun irradiation, which promotes light&#8208;harvesting capacity via multiple reflections on the surface and provides competitive benefits for preventing deposition of salt while quickly pumping the water, for long&#8208;term provision of drinking water in remote locations.

Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts
Carbon&#8208;supported single&#8208;atom catalysts are subjected to surface oxidation and hydroxylation upon long&#8208;term exposure to ambient environment, causing severe performance degradation. The hydrogen passivation strategy developed by Jianglan Shui and co&#8208;workers in article number 2103600 can protect the catalytic active sites and ultimately improve the storage stability of single&#8208;atom catalysts.

Liquid Gallium
In article number 2104807, Antal J&#225;kli, Metin Sitti, and co&#8208;workers observe a Schlieren texture in a supercooled liquid gallium film on a glass surface with an open&#8208;air boundary. The thin liquid film visualized with a circularly polarized light using reflective polarized microscopy shows two brush defects due to the presence of only 1/2&#8208;strength defects. The boundary layer tends to align the liquid crystal director parallel to the substrate in a degenerate planar condition.

NO2 Sensors
In article number 2101216, Il&#8208;Doo Kim and co&#8208;workers demonstrate a conductive metal&#8211;organic framework (cMOF) with enhanced activity owing to encapsulation of ultrasmall bimetallic nanoparticles (BNPs) within the cMOF matrix. The combination of the high surface area of the cMOF and the bimetallic synergies of the PtRu BNPs enables application as a highly sensitive chemiresistive sensor toward NO2 detection.

         <title>Recent Advances on Transition Metal Dichalcogenides for Electrochemical Energy Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 38, September 23, 2021. </description>

Some of the recent research progress of rationally activating the basal plane of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) for electrochemical energy conversion is summarized. The activated TMDC basal plane, with the integrated advantages of structure and composition, shows much enhanced electrochemical activity.








Abstract
Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) hold great promise for electrochemical energy conversion technologies in view of their unique structural features associated with the layered structure and ultrathin thickness. Because the inert basal plane accounts for the majority of a TMDC's bulk, activation of the basal plane sites is necessary to fully exploit the intrinsic potential of TMDCs. Here, recent advances on TMDCs&#8208;based hybrids/composites with greatly enhanced electrochemical activity are reviewed. After a summary of the synthesis of TMDCs with different sizes and morphologies, comprehensive in&#8208;plane activation strategies are described in detail, mainly including in&#8208;plane&#8208;modification&#8208;induced phase transformation, surface&#8208;layer modulation, and interlayer modification/coupling. Simultaneously, the underlying mechanisms for improved electrochemical activities are highlighted. Finally, the strategic evaluation on further research directions of TMDCs in&#8208;plane activation is featured. This work would shed some light on future design trends of TMDCs&#8208;based functional materials for electrochemical energy&#8208;related applications.

         <title>Membrane Materials for Selective Ion Separations at the Water&#8211;Energy Nexus</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 38, September 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Emerging water and energy technologies often require membranes that selectively separate an ion from similar species. Progress in enhancing selective ion transport in polymeric membranes is described, followed by analysis of three advanced material classes that are possible candidates for ion&#8208;selective membranes owing to their molecular&#8208;level control over physicochemical properties. Research directions and challenges for developing ion&#8208;selective membranes are discussed.








Abstract
Synthetic polymer membranes are enabling components in key technologies at the water&#8211;energy nexus, including desalination and energy conversion, because of their high water/salt selectivity or ionic conductivity. However, many applications at the water&#8211;energy nexus require ion selectivity, or separation of specific ionic species from other similar species. Here, the ion selectivity of conventional polymeric membrane materials is assessed and recent progress in enhancing selective transport via tailored free volume elements and ion&#8211;membrane interactions is described. In view of the limitations of polymeric membranes, three material classes&#8212;porous crystalline materials, 2D materials, and discrete biomimetic channels&#8212;are highlighted as possible candidates for ion&#8208;selective membranes owing to their molecular&#8208;level control over physical and chemical properties. Lastly, research directions and critical challenges for developing bioinspired membranes with molecular recognition are provided.

         <title>Heterogeneous Functional Dielectric Patterns for Charge&#8208;Carrier Modulation in Ultraflexible Organic Integrated Circuits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modulating the behavior of charge carriers in respective transistors on the same substrate is essential in maximizing the performance of organic integrated circuits (ICs). Heterogeneous functional dielectric patterns for charge&#8208;carrier modulation are obtained by UV patterning. Consequently, the threshold voltage is precisely controlled within the 2&#8211;4&#160;V operational range. Furthermore, these ultraflexible organic ICs exhibit the highest performance.








Abstract
Flexible electronics have gained considerable attention for application in wearable devices. Organic transistors are potential candidates to develop flexible integrated circuits (ICs). A primary technique for maximizing their reliability, gain, and operation speed is the modulation of charge&#8208;carrier behavior in the respective transistors fabricated on the same substrate. In this work, heterogeneous functional dielectric patterns (HFDP) of ultrathin polymer gate dielectrics of poly((&#177;)endo,exo&#8208;bicyclo[2.2.1]hept&#8208;ene&#8208;2,3&#8208;dicarboxylic acid, diphenylester) (PNDPE) are introduced. The HFDP that are obtained via the photo&#8208;Fries rearrangement by ultraviolet radiation in the homogeneous PNDPE provide a functional area for charge&#8208;carrier modulation. This leads to programmable threshold voltage control over a wide range (&#8722;1.5 to +0.2&#160;V) in the transistors with a high patterning resolution, at 2&#160;V operational voltage. The transistors also exhibit high operational stability over 140 days and under the bias&#8208;stress duration of 1800&#160;s. With the HFDP, the performance metrics of ICs, for example, the noise margin and gain of the zero&#8208;VGS load inverters and the oscillation frequency of ring oscillators are improved to 80%, 1200, and 2.5&#160;kHz, respectively, which are the highest among the previously reported zero&#8208;VGS&#8208;based organic circuits. The HFDP can be applied to much complex and ultraflexible ICs.

         <title>Biosensor&#8208;Enabled Multiplexed On&#8208;Site Therapeutic Drug Monitoring of Antibiotics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first electrochemical biosensor, with a synthetic&#8208;biology&#8208;emabled antibody&#8208;free assay, for temporal monitoring of piperacillin/tazobactam in exhaled breath condensate, along with a correlation study exploring the link between monitored drug levels, is presented. The validation of the findings with gold&#8208;standard measurements demonstrates the suitability of the system as a low&#8208;cost, rapid, and sample&#8208;independent tool for multiplexed on&#8208;site therapeutic drug monitoring.








Abstract
Personalized antibiotherapy ensures that the antibiotic concentration remains in the optimal therapeutic window to maximize efficacy, minimize side effects, and avoid the emergence of drug resistance due to insufficient dosing. However, such individualized schemes need frequent sampling to tailor the blood antibiotic concentrations. To optimally integrate therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) into the clinical workflow, antibiotic levels can either be measured in blood using point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing (POCT), or can rely on noninvasive sampling. Here, a versatile biosensor with an antibody&#8208;free assay for on&#8208;site TDM is presented. The platform is evaluated with an animal study, where antibiotic concentrations are quantified in different matrices including whole blood, plasma, urine, saliva, and exhaled breath condensate (EBC). The clearance and the temporal evaluation of antibiotic levels in EBC and plasma are demonstrated. Influence of matrix effects on measured drug concentrations is determined by comparing the plasma levels with those in noninvasive samples. The system's potential for blood&#8208;based POCT is further illustrated by tracking &#223;&#8209;lactam concentrations in untreated blood samples. Finally, multiplexing capabilities are explored successfully for multianalyte/sample analysis. By enabling a rapid, low&#8208;cost, sample&#8208;independent, and multiplexed on&#8208;site TDM, this system can shift the paradigm of &#8220;one&#8209;size&#8208;fits&#8208;all&#8221; strategy.

         <title>Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with EQE Exceeding 28% through a Synergetic Dual&#8208;Additive Strategy for Defect Passivation and Nanostructure Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;additive strategy is developed to prepare quasi&#8208;core/shell&#8208;structure perovskite nanocrystals by using 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 and poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate as the additives. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art external quantum efficiency of 28.1% and increased operating lifetime are achieved for the light&#8208;emitting diodes, owing to the synergetic effect for reduced defect density and improved environmental stability of the perovskite emissive layer.








Abstract
Quasi&#8208;2D perovskites have long been considered to have favorable &#8220;energy funnel/cascade&#8221; structures and excellent optical properties compared with their 3D counterparts. However, most quasi&#8208;2D perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) exhibit high external quantum efficiency (EQE) but unsatisfactory operating stability due to Auger recombination induced by high current density. Herein, a synergetic dual&#8208;additive strategy is adopted to prepare perovskite films with low defect density and high environmental stability by using 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 and poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate (MPEG&#8208;MAA) as the additives. The dual additives containing C&#63743;O&#63743;C bonds can not only effectively reduce the perovskite defects but also destroy the self&#8208;aggregation of organic ligands, inducing the formation of perovskite nanocrystals with quasi&#8208;core/shell structure. After thermal annealing, the MPEG&#8208;MAA with its C&#63742;C bond can be polymerized to obtain a comb&#8208;like polymer, further protecting the passivated perovskite nanocrystals against water and oxygen. Finally, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art green PeLEDs with a normal EQE of 25.2% and a maximum EQE of 28.1% are achieved, and the operating lifetime (T50) of the device in air environment is over ten times increased, providing a novel and effective strategy to make high efficiency and long operating lifetime PeLEDs.

         <title>Organic Semiconductor Single Crystals for X&#8208;ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic semiconductor single crystals of 9,10&#8208;diphenylanthracene (9,10&#8208;DPA) are prepared by a low&#8208;temperature solution&#8208;growth method and exhibit ultrafast radioluminescence with ultrahigh photon&#8208;conversion efficiency, and make it highly promising for X&#8208;ray detection with ultralow detectable dose rate and high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging. These findings demonstrate the potential of organic crystals for promising low&#8208;cost X&#8208;ray imaging technology in the future.








Abstract
Low&#8208;dose, high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging is vital for medical diagnostics and material/device analyses. Current X&#8208;ray imagers are dominated by expensive inorganic materials via high&#8208;temperature solid processes (up to 1700 &#176;C, e.g., CsI:Tl) with heavy metal elements. It is essential to search for new materials as X&#8208;ray imagers with low growth temperature, low cost, high sensitivity, along with high chemical and environmental stability. Here, 9,10&#8208;diphenylanthracene (9,10&#8208;DPA) single crystals are used as a representative model, which are grown via low&#8208;temperature solution processes, exhibiting intense X&#8208;ray radioluminescence with ultrahigh photon&#8208;conversion efficiency, ultrafast response and high sensitivity. The resolution of devices based on organic crystals exceeds 20.00 lp mm&#8722;1. Meanwhile the crystals exhibit high cycle performance under X&#8208;ray irradiation and environmental stability. This study demonstrates that organic semiconductors have potential use in low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;sensitivity and low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray imaging systems.

         <title>Electro&#8208;Optic Activity in Excess of 1000 pm V&#8722;1 Achieved via Theory&#8208;Guided Organic Chromophore Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using theory&#8208;guided design, a new series of organic electro&#8208;optic chromophores is demonstrated, based on strong bis(4&#8208;dialkylaminophenyl)phenylamino electron donating groups. Density functional theory modeling and hyper&#8208;Rayleigh scattering measurements confirm large improvements in hyperpolarizability. The best electro&#8208;optic coefficient (r33&#160;= 1100&#160;&#177; 100 pm V&#8722;1) is nearly twice as high as the previous best example and higher than thin film barium titanate.








Abstract
High performance organic electro&#8208;optic (OEO) materials enable ultrahigh bandwidth, small footprint, and extremely low drive voltage in silicon&#8208;organic hybrid and plasmonic&#8208;organic hybrid photonic devices. However, practical OEO materials under device&#8208;relevant conditions are generally limited to performance of &#8776;300 pm V&#8722;1 (10&#215; the EO response of lithium niobate). By means of theory&#8208;guided design, a new series of OEO chromophores is demonstrated, based on strong bis(4&#8208;dialkylaminophenyl)phenylamino electron donating groups, capable of EO coefficients (r33) in excess of 1000 pm V&#8722;1. Density functional theory modeling and hyper&#8208;Rayleigh scattering measurements are performed and confirm the large improvement in hyperpolarizability due to the stronger donor. The EO performance of the exemplar chromophore in the series, BAY1, is evaluated neat and at various concentrations in polymer host and shows a nearly linear increase in r33 and poling efficiency (r33/Ep, Ep is poling field) with increasing chromophore concentration. 25 wt% BAY1/polymer composite shows a higher poling efficiency (3.9&#160;&#177; 0.1 nm2 V&#8722;2) than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art neat chromophores. Using a high&#8208;&#949; charge blocking layer with BAY1, a record&#8208;high r33 (1100&#160;&#177; 100 pm V&#8722;1) and poling efficiency (17.8&#160;&#177; 0.8&#160;nm2 V&#8722;2) at 1310&#160;nm are achieved. This is the first reported OEO material with electro&#8208;optic response larger than thin&#8208;film barium titanate.

         <title>Long&#8208;Range Forces in Rock&#8208;Salt&#8208;Type Tellurides and How they Mirror the Underlying Chemical Bonding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 37, September 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Examining the chemical bonding in rock&#8208;salt&#8208;type IV&#8211;VI functional materials by projected force constants as derived from ab initio thermochemistry yields unusually strong long&#8208;range forces along the cubic lattice vectors, impossible to account for by either two&#8208;center covalent or ionic bonding. The full analysis, including orbital&#8208;based bonding descriptors, points toward hyperbonding, thereby explaining certain unique properties of this material class.








Abstract
Chemical bonding in main&#8208;group IV chalcogenides is an intensely discussed topic, easily understandable because of their remarkable physical properties that predestine these solid&#8208;state materials for their widespread use in, for instance, thermoelectrics and phase&#8208;change memory applications. The atomistic origin of their unusual property portfolio remains somewhat unclear, however, even though different and sometimes conflicting chemical&#8208;bonding concepts have been introduced in the recent years. Here, it is proposed that projecting phononic force&#8208;constant tensors for pairs of atoms along differing directions and ranges provide a suitable and quantitative descriptor of the bonding nature for these materials. In combination with orbital&#8208;based quantitative measures of covalency such as crystal orbital Hamilton populations (COHP), it is concluded that the well&#8208;established many&#8208;center and even n&#8208;center bonding is an appropriate picture of the underlying quantum&#8208;chemical bonding mechanism, supporting the recent proposal of hyperbonded phase&#8208;change materials.

         <title>Increasing Accessible Subsurface to Improving Rate Capability and Cycling Stability of Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

Heteroatom doping affects the interlayer spacing of the subsurface region much more than the bulk for carbonaceous nanoparticles. The increased accessible subsurface boosts the pseudocapacitive capacity and endows SRNDC&#8208;700 with excellent rate performance up to 50&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. This varies from diffusion&#8208;controlled capacity determinism and provides a novel design concept for doping carbonaceous material.








Abstract
Numerous studies have reported that the enhancement of rate capability of carbonaceous anode by heteroatom doping is due to the increased diffusion&#8208;controlled capacity induced by expanding interlayer spacing. However, percentage of diffusion&#8208;controlled capacity is less than 30% as scan rate is larger than 1&#160;mV s&#8722;1, suggesting there is inaccuracy in recognizing principle of improving rate capability of carbonaceous anode. In this paper, it is found that the heteroatom doping has little impact on interlayer spacing of carbon in bulk phase, meaning that diffusion&#8208;controlled capacity is hard to be enhanced by doping. After synergizing with tensile stress, however, the interlayer spacing in subsurface region is obviously expanded to 0.40&#160;nm, which will increase the thickness of accessible subsurface region at high current density. So SRNDC&#8208;700 electrodes display a high specific capacity of 160.6 and 69.5&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 20 and 50&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1, respectively. Additionally, the high reversibility of carbon structure insures ultralong cycling stability and hence attenuation of SRNDC&#8208;700 is only 0.0025% per cycle even at 10&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 for 6000 cycles. This report sheds new insight into mechanism of improving electrochemical performance of carbonaceous anode by doping and provides a novel design concept for doping carbon.

         <title>Crystallization by Amorphous Particle Attachment: On the Evolution of Texture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 37, September 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biogenic minerals are shown not only to provide key insight into material morphogenesis during crystallization by amorphous particle attachment but also to teach us fundamental new mechanisms that have a profound effect on textural evolution during non&#8208;classical crystal growth. A link between the emergence of texture and amorphous particle accretion rate is established.








Abstract
Crystallization by particle attachment (CPA) is a gradual process where each step has its own thermodynamic and kinetic constrains defining a unique pathway of crystal growth. An important example is biomineralization of calcium carbonate through amorphous precursors that are morphed into shapes and textural patterns that cannot be envisioned by the classical monomer&#8208;by&#8208;monomer approach. Here, a mechanistic link between the collective kinetics of mineral deposition and the emergence of crystallographic texture is established. Using the prismatic ultrastructure in bivalve shells as a model, a fundamental leap is made in the ability to analytically describe the evolution of form and texture of biological mineralized tissues and to design the structure and crystallographic properties of synthetic materials formed by CPA.

         <title>Highly Efficient Uniaxial In&#8208;Plane Stretching of a 2D Material via Ion Insertion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 37, September 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ion insertion in between the 2D layers of WTe2 is shown to induce an exotic crystallographic phase. This novel phase is linked to uniquely large uniaxial in&#8208;plane strain. On&#8208;chip electrochemical control over the lithium content in single flakes of WTe2 is demonstrated as an efficient, fast, and reversible way to control the strain, making LixWTe2 a promising microscale actuator.








Abstract
On&#8208;chip dynamic strain engineering requires efficient micro&#8208;actuators that can generate large in&#8208;plane strains. Inorganic electrochemical actuators are unique in that they are driven by low voltages (&#8776;1&#160;V) and produce considerable strains (&#8776;1%). However, actuation speed and efficiency are limited by mass transport of ions. Minimizing the number of ions required to actuate is thus key to enabling useful &#8220;straintronic&#8221; devices. Here, it is shown that the electrochemical intercalation of exceptionally few lithium ions into WTe2 causes large anisotropic in&#8208;plane strain: 5% in one in&#8208;plane direction and 0.1% in the other. This efficient stretching of the 2D WTe2 layers contrasts to intercalation&#8208;induced strains in related materials which are predominantly in the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction. The unusual actuation of LixWTe2 is linked to the formation of a newly discovered crystallographic phase, referred to as Td', with an exotic atomic arrangement. On&#8208;chip low&#8208;voltage (&lt;0.2&#160;V) control is demonstrated over the transition to the novel phase and its composition. Within the Td'&#8208;Li0.5&#8722;&#948;WTe2 phase, a uniaxial in&#8208;plane strain of 1.4% is achieved with a change of &#948; of only 0.075. This makes the in&#8208;plane chemical expansion coefficient of Td'&#8208;Li0.5&#8722;&#948;WTe2 far greater than of any other single&#8208;phase material, enabling fast and efficient planar electrochemical actuation.

         <title>Construction of a Porous Metal&#8211;Organic Framework with a High Density of Open Cr Sites for Record N2/O2 Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 37, September 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A N2&#8208;selective metal&#8211;organic framework material TYUT&#8208;96Cr, with dual open Cr (III) sites, record&#8208;high N2 capture capacity, and N2/O2 selectivity is developed, showing the highest separation performance, far beyond the current adsorbents. Importantly, this material displays ultrahigh structural stability under water, acid/base, and humidity conditions, being practically useful for O2 separation and purification in industry.








Abstract
The removal of low concentration N2 is of great significance and challenging in the industrial production of high&#8208;purity O2. Herein, a chromium&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework, namely, TYUT&#8208;96Cr, is reported, which has an unprecedented N2 capture capacity of 37.46 cm3 cm&#8722;3 and N2/O2 (5:95, v/v) selectivity up to 26.95 (298 K and 1 bar), thus setting new benchmarks for all reported metal&#8211;organic frameworks and commercially used ones (Li&#8208;LSX and 13X). Breakthrough experiments reveal that N2 can be directly extracted from various N2/O2 (79:21, 50:50, 5:95, and 1:99, v/v) mixtures by this material, affording a record&#8208;high O2&#8208;production scale with 99.99% purity. Density functional theory calculations and in situ infrared spectroscopy studies demonstrate that the high&#8208;density open Cr (III) sites in TYUT&#8208;96Cr can behave as effective Lewis acidic sites, thus resulting in a strong affinity toward N2. The high N2 adsorption selectivity, exceptional separation performance, and ultrahigh structural stability render this porous material with great potential for this important industrial application.

         <title>In Situ Chemical Lithiation Transforms Diamond&#8208;Like Carbon into an Ultrastrong Ion Conductor for Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 37, September 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ lithiated DLC/PP separator suppresses Li&#8208;dendrite growth and redistributes Li ions to render dendrite&#8208;free lithium deposition, which results in stable cycling of lithium plating/stripping (over 4500 h) at 3.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and more than 200 stable cycles at 0.2 C in a Li || LiNi0.5Co0.3Mn0.2O2 pouch cell with a cathode mass loading of &#8776;9&#160;mg cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Lithium (Li)&#8208;metal anodes are of great promise for next&#8208;generation batteries due to their high theoretical capacity and low redox potential. However, Li&#8208;dendrite growth during cycling imposes a tremendous safety concern on the practical application of Li&#8208;metal anodes. Herein, an effective approach to suppress Li&#8208;dendrite growth by coating a polypropylene (PP) separator with a thin layer of ultrastrong diamond&#8208;like carbon (DLC) is reported. Theoretical calculations indicate that the DLC coating layer undergoes in situ chemical lithiation once assembled with the lithium&#8208;metal anode, transforming the DLC/PP separator into an excellent 3D Li&#8208;ion conductor. This in situ lithiated DLC/PP separator can not only mechanically suppress Li&#8208;dendrite growth by its intrinsically high modulus (&#8776;100&#160;GPa), but also uniformly redistributes Li ions to render dendrite&#8208;free lithium deposition. The twofold effects of the DLC/PP separator result in stable cycling of lithium plating/stripping (over 4500 h) at a high current density of 3&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Remarkably, this approach enables more than 1000 stable cycles at 5 C with a capacity retention of &#8776;71% in a Li || LiFePO4 coin cell and more than 200 stable cycles at 0.2 C in a Li || LiNi0.5Co0.3Mn0.2O2 pouch cell with cathode mass loading of &#8776;9&#160;mg cm&#8722;2.

         <title>The Wet&#8208;Oxidation of a Cu(111) Foil Coated by Single Crystal Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 37, September 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
As&#8208;grown graphene by chemical vapor deposition cannot protect the Cu surface from wet&#8208;oxidation because there is a diffusion pathway enabling water to diffuse from the graphene edges to the graphene/Cu interface: a &#8220;gap&#8221; between the graphene and each of the bunched Cu step corners. This interfacial diffusion of water is eliminated if ultraflat graphene is coating an ultrasmooth Cu(111) surface.








Abstract
The wet&#8208;oxidation of a single crystal Cu(111) foil is studied by growing single crystal graphene islands on it followed by soaking it in water. 18O&#8208;labeled water is also used; the oxygen atoms in the formed copper oxides in both the bare and graphene&#8208;coated Cu regions come from water. The oxidation of the graphene&#8208;coated Cu regions is enabled by water diffusing from the edges of graphene along the bunched Cu steps, and along some graphene ripples where such are present. This interfacial diffusion of water can occur because of the separation between the graphene and the &#8220;step corner&#8221; of bunched Cu steps. Density functional theory simulations suggest that adsorption of water in this gap is thermodynamically stable; the &#8220;step&#8208;induced&#8208;diffusion model&#8221; also applies to graphene&#8208;coated Cu surfaces of various other crystal orientations. Since bunched Cu steps and graphene ripples are diffusion pathways for water, ripple&#8208;free graphene is prepared on ultrasmooth Cu(111) surfaces and it is found that the graphene completely shields the underlying Cu from wet&#8208;oxidation. This study greatly deepens the understanding of how a graphene&#8208;coated copper surface is oxidized, and shows that graphene completely prevents the oxidation when that surface is ultrasmooth and when the graphene has no ripples or wrinkles.

         <title>Mechanochromic, Structurally Colored, and Edible Hydrogels Prepared from Hydroxypropyl Cellulose and Gelatin</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 37, September 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;supporting and structurally colored hydrogel is produced by combining hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) and gelatin in a scalable formulation process. By retaining the lyotropic, liquid crystalline behavior of the HPC into the gelled state, a spectrum of dynamic colors is produced. Rheological studies confirm a desirable non&#8208;Newtonian shear&#8208;thinning behavior and an increased stiffness, which result in a much quicker mechanochromic relaxation time.








Abstract
Hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) is an edible, cost&#8208;effective and widely used derivative of cellulose. Under lyotropic conditions in water, HPC forms a photonic, liquid crystalline mesophase with an exceptional mechanochromic response. However, due to insufficient physical cross&#8208;linking photonic HPC can flow freely as a viscous liquid, preventing the exploitation of this mechanochromic material in the absence of any external encapsulation or structural confinement. Here this challenge is addressed by mixing HPC and gelatin in water to form a self&#8208;supporting, viscoelastic, and edible supramolecular photonic hydrogel. It is demonstrated that the structural coloration, mechanochromism and non&#8208;Newtonian shear&#8208;thinning behavior of the lyotropic HPC solutions can all be retained into the gel state. Moreover, the rigidity of the HPC&#8208;gel provides a 69% shorter mechanochromic relaxation time back to its initial color when compared to the liquid HPC&#8211;water only system, broadening the dynamic color range of HPC by approximately 2.5&#215; in response to a compressive pressure. Finally, the ability to formulate the HPC&#8208;gels in a scalable fashion from only water and &#8220;food&#8208;grade&#8221; constituents unlocks a wide range of potential applications, from response&#8209;tunable mechanochromic materials and colorant&#8208;free food decoration, to short&#8208;term sensors in, for example, biodegradable &#8220;smart labels&#8221; for food packaging.

         <title>Arsenene Nanodots with Selective Killing Effects and their Low&#8208;Dose Combination with &#223;&#8208;Elemene for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 37, September 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
PEGylated arsenene nanodots (AsNDs@PEG) with high monoelemental arsenic purity and negligible systemic toxicity are identified as a new&#8208;concept arsenical drug for selectively treating solid tumors through the valence&#8208;change of arsenic to generate toxic oxidation states and on&#8208;demand photothermal therapy. This work can encourage a fast&#8208;paced clinical translation of arsenene for tumor treatments with potentially low attrition rates.








Abstract
Arsenical drugs have achieved hallmark success in treating patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia, but expanding their clinical utility to solid tumors has proven difficult with the contradiction between the therapeutic efficacy and the systemic toxicity. Here, leveraging efforts from materials science, biocompatible PEGylated arsenene nanodots (AsNDs@PEG) with high monoelemental arsenic purity that can selectively and effectively treat solid tumors are synthesized. The intrinsic selective killing effect of AsNDs@PEG is closely related to high oxidative stress in tumor cells, which leads to an activated valence&#8208;change of arsenic (from less toxic As0 to severely toxic oxidation states), followed by decreased superoxide dismutase activity and massive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. These effects occur selectively within cancer cells, causing mitochondrial damage, cell&#8208;cycle arrest, and DNA damage. Moreover, AsNDs@PEG when applied in a multi&#8208;drug combination strategy with &#946;&#8208;elemene, a plant&#8208;derived anticancer drug, achieves synergistic antitumor outcomes, and its newly discovered on&#8208;demand photothermal properties facilitate the elimination of the tumors without recurrence, potentially further expanding its clinical utility. In line of the practicability for a large&#8208;scale fabrication and negligible systemic toxicity of AsNDs@PEG (even at high doses and with repetitive administration), a new&#8208;concept arsenical drug with high therapeutic efficacy for selective solid tumor therapy is provided.

         <title>High&#8208;Resolution Imaging of Human Viruses in Liquid Droplets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 37, September 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first high&#8208;resolution view of biological assemblies contained in a liquid environment is presented. The foundation for analyzing structure and dynamics of soft materials in real&#8208;time and in 3D is established.








Abstract
Liquid&#8208;phase electron microscopy (LP&#8208;EM) is an exciting new area in the materials imaging field, providing unprecedented views of molecular processes. Time&#8208;resolved insights from LP&#8208;EM studies are a strong complement to the remarkable results achievable with other high&#8208;resolution techniques. Here, the opportunities to expand LP&#8208;EM technology beyond 2D temporal assessments and into the 3D regime are described. The results show new structures and dynamic insights of human viruses contained in minute volumes of liquid while acquired in a rapid timeframe. To develop this strategy, adeno&#8208;associated virus (AAV) is used as a model system. AAV is a well&#8208;known gene therapy vehicle with current applications involving drug delivery and vaccine development for COVID&#8208;19. Improving the understanding of the physical properties of biological entities in a liquid state, as maintained in the human body, has broad societal implications for human health and disease.

         <title>Controllable Heterojunctions with a Semicoherent Phase Boundary Boosting the Potassium Storage of CoSe2/FeSe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 37, September 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modulation of the crystal orientation allows an effective way to control the electrical properties of a heterojunction. By engineering the heterointerfaces, rich vacancies and ultrafine CoSe2&#8211;FeSe2 heterojunctions with semicoherent phase boundary are simultaneously obtained. The smart design not only modifies the electronic structure but also boosts the K+ diffusion.








Abstract
Heterostructure construction is an efficient method for reinforcing K+ storage of transition metal selenides. The spontaneously developed internal electric fields give a strong boost to charge transport and significantly reduce the activation energy. Nevertheless, perfection of the interfacial region based on the energy level gradient and lattice matching degree is still a great challenge. Herein, rich vacancies and ultrafine CoSe2&#8211;FeSe2 heterojunctions with semicoherent phase boundary are simultaneously obtained, which possess unique electronic structures and abundant active sites. When employed as anodes for potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs), CoSe2&#8211;FeSe2@C composites display a reversible potassium storage of 401.1 mAh g&#8722;1 at 100&#160;mA g&#8722;1 and even 275 mAh g&#8722;1 at 2 A g&#8722;1. Theoretical calculation also reveals that the potassium&#8208;ion diffusion can be dramatically promoted by the controllable CoSe2&#8211;FeSe2 heterojunction.

         <title>Domino Reaction Encoded Heterogeneous Colloidal Microswarm with On&#8208;Demand Morphological Adaptability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 37, September 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomimetic colloidal swarm system, is developed, which can synchronously traverse complex environments through adaptive transformation and perform multitasks with domino reaction&#8208;enhanced efficiency through specialization and cooperation between building blocks, thus contributing to the development of multifunctional microswarm and the applications of micro/nanorobots for targeted therapy.








Abstract
Emulating natural swarm intelligence with group&#8208;level functionality in artificial micro/nanorobotic systems offers an opportunity to sublimate the limited functions of individuals and revolutionize their applications. However, achieving synchronous operation of microswarms with environmental adaptability and cooperative tasking capability remains a challenge. Here, an adaptive and heterogeneous colloidal magnetic microswarm with domino reaction encoded cooperative functions is presented. Through programming external magnetic fields, the system self&#8208;organizes into two swarm states, that is, vortex and ribbon microswarms, which can switch between each other reversibly within seconds, allowing to traverse tortuous, branched, and confined environments through adaptive morphological transformation. By specializing subgroups of building blocks with separate functions, cooperative tasking capability is integrated into the heterogeneous system following a &#8220;division of labor&#8221; manner. Given targeted therapy as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept task, the coordinated delivery of heterogeneous colloidal system across a complex environment with an access rate higher than 90% is demonstrated, and the specialization and cooperation between building blocks to disrupt multiple growth pathways of cancer cells via domino reaction are realized. The reconfigurable microswarm with hierarchical functionality presents a bioinspired approach to adapt to environmental variations and address multitasking requirements, which advances the development of microrobotic swarms and promises major benefits in biomedical fields.

         <title>Designing Shape Morphing Behavior through Local Programming of Mechanical Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 37, September 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different kinds of shape morphing are realized with programmable materials. Therefore, processing functions as well as if&#8208;then&#8208;else&#8208;conditions are implemented in unit cells. Local geometrical adaptions allow controlling the global shape in dependency of a load amplitude. Combining these elements, (strain&#8208;dependent) shapes as well as a moving hillock are created within a material.








Abstract
Shape morphing implicates that a specific condition leads to a morphing reaction. The material thus transforms from one shape to another in a predefined manner. In this paper, not only the target shape but rather the evolution of the material's shape as a function of the applied strain is programmed. To rationalize the design process, concepts from informatics (processing functions, for example, Poisson's ratio (PR) as function of strain: &#957;&#160;= f(&#949;) and if&#8208;then&#8208;else conditions) will be introduced. Three types of shape morphing behavior will be presented: (1) achieving a target shape by linearly increasing the amplitude of the shape, (2) filling up a target shape in linear steps, and (3) shifting a bulge through the material to a target position. In the first case, the shape is controlled by a geometric gradient within the material. The filling kind of behavior was&#160;implemented by logical operations. Moreover, programming moving hillocks (3) requires to implement a sinusoidal function &#949;y&#160;= sin&#8201;(&#949;x) and an if&#8208;then&#8208;else statement into the unit cells combined with a global stiffness gradient. The three cases will be used to show how the combination of mechanical mechanisms as well as the related parameter distribution enable a programmable shape morphing behavior in an inverse design&#160;process.

         <title>Intracellular Dynamic Assembly of Deep&#8208;Red Emitting Supramolecular Nanostructures Based on the Pt&#8230;Pt Metallophilic Interaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 37, September 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of molecular platinum complexes are described that, in the presence of serum proteins, self&#8208;assemble via the metallophilic interaction. The resulting nanoaggregates are deep&#8208;red emissive; they cross the cell membranes by endocytosis, but instead of following the regular lysosome&#8208;assisted pathway, directly end up in the mitochondria.








Abstract
Many drug delivery systems end up in the lysosome because they are built from covalent or kinetically inert supramolecular bonds. To reach other organelles, nanoparticles hence need to either be made from a kinetically labile interaction that allows re&#8208;assembly of the nanoparticles inside the cell following endocytic uptake, or, be taken up by a mechanism that short&#8208;circuits the classical endocytosis pathway. In this work, the intracellular fate of nanorods that self&#8208;assemble via the Pt&#8230;Pt interaction of cyclometalated platinum(II) compounds, is studied. These deep&#8208;red emissive nanostructures (638&#160;nm excitation, &#8776;700&#160;nm emission) are stabilized by proteins in cell medium. Once in contact with cancer cells, they cross the cell membrane via dynamin&#8208; and clathrin&#8208;dependent endocytosis. However, time&#8208;dependent confocal colocalization and cellular electron microscopy demonstrate that they directly move to mitochondria without passing by the lysosomes. Altogether, this study suggests that Pt&#8230;Pt interaction is strong enough to generate emissive, aggregated nanoparticles inside cells, but labile enough to allow these nanostructures to reach the mitochondria without being trapped in the lysosomes. These findings open new venues to the development of bioimaging nanoplatforms based on the Pt&#8230;Pt interaction.

Altogether, this study suggests that Pt&#8230;Pt interaction is strong enough to generate emissive, aggregated nanoparticles inside cells, but labile enough to allow these nanostructures to reach the mitochondria without being trapped in the lysosomes. These findings open new venues to the development of bioimaging nanoplatforms based on the Pt&#8230;Pt interaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering the Dynamics of Cell Adhesion Cues in Supramolecular Hydrogels for Facile Control over Cell Encapsulation and Behavior</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 37, September 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Slow&#8208; and fast&#8208;exchanging molecules are co&#8208;assembled into transient fibrous networks, forming supramolecular hydrogels. Modulating the ratio between these molecules can dictate the extent of dynamic behavior of the hydrogels and incorporated bioactive cues. The dynamic character of supramolecular building blocks and the tunability of this system are exploited for facile encapsulation of cellular components and control over their behavior.








Abstract
The extracellular matrix (ECM) forms through hierarchical assembly of small and larger polymeric molecules into a transient, hydrogel&#8208;like fibrous network that provides mechanical support and biochemical cues to cells. Synthetic, fibrous supramolecular networks formed via non&#8208;covalent assembly of various molecules are therefore potential candidates as synthetic mimics of the natural ECM, provided that functionalization with biochemical cues is effective. Here, combinations of slow and fast exchanging molecules that self&#8208;assemble into supramolecular fibers are employed to form transient hydrogel networks with tunable dynamic behavior. Obtained results prove that modulating the ratio between these molecules dictates the extent of dynamic behavior of the hydrogels at both the molecular and the network level, which is proposed to enable effective incorporation of cell&#8208;adhesive functionalities in these materials. Excitingly, the dynamic nature of the supramolecular components in this system can be conveniently employed to formulate multicomponent supramolecular hydrogels for easy culturing and encapsulation of single cells, spheroids, and organoids. Importantly, these findings highlight the significance of molecular design and exchange dynamics for the application of supramolecular hydrogels as synthetic ECM mimics.

         <title>Antiperovskite Gd3SnC: Unusual Coexistence of Ferromagnetism and Heavy Fermions in Gd Lattice</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 37, September 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electronically inverted structures with switched crystallographic positions of cations and anions from the original structure allow an exotic phenomenon to be accessed. Antiperovskite Gd3SnC exhibits unusual coexistence of ferromagnetism and heavy fermions, contradicting the common belief that heavy&#8208;fermion behavior cannot emerge in ferromagnetic 4f&#8208;block elements. These unusual phenomena originate from the mixed bonding nature of antiperovskite structure.








Abstract
Inverted structures of common crystal lattices, referred to as antistructures, are rare in nature due to their thermodynamic constraints imposed by the switched cation and anion positions in reference to the original structure. However, a stable antistructure formed with mixed bonding characters of constituent elements in unusual valence states can provide unexpected material properties. Here, a heavy&#8208;fermion behavior of ferromagnetic gadolinium lattice in Gd3SnC antiperovskite is reported, contradicting the common belief that ferromagnetic gadolinium cannot be a heavy&#8208;fermion system due to the deep energy level of localized 4f&#8208;electrons. The specific heat shows an unusually large Sommerfeld coefficient of &#8776;1114 mJ mol&#8722;1 K&#8722;2 with a logarithmic behavior of non&#8208;Fermi&#8208;liquid state. It is demonstrated that the heavy&#8208;fermion behavior in the non&#8208;Fermi&#8208;liquid state appears to arise from the hybridized electronic states of gadolinium 5d&#8208;electrons participating in metallic Gd&#63743;Gd and covalent Gd&#63743;C bonds. These results accentuate the unusual chemical bonds in CGd6 octahedra with the dual characters of gadolinium 5d&#8208;electrons for the emergence of heavy fermions.

         <title>A Barium Titanate&#8208;on&#8208;Oxide Insulator Optoelectronics Platform</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 37, September 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A barium&#8208;titanate&#8208;on&#8208;insulator platform with high&#8208;quality barium titanate single&#8208;crystal growth and excellent vertical optical confinement is introduced. The phase&#8208;transition temperature of barium titanate in the platform is extended to at least 700 &#176;C, which helps to avoid difficulties in device fabrication caused by heating, such as cracking. A low propagation loss is verified in the resultant fabricated waveguide.








Abstract
Electro&#8208;optic modulators are among the most important building blocks in optical communication networks. Lithium niobate, for example, has traditionally been widely used to fabricate high&#8208;speed optical modulators due to its large Pockels effect. Another material, barium titanate, nominally has a 50&#160;times stronger r&#8208;parameter and would ordinarily be a more attractive material choice for such modulators or other applications. In practice, barium titanate thin films for optical waveguide devices are usually grown on magnesium oxide due to its low refractive index, allowing vertical mode confinement. However, the crystal quality is normally degraded. Here, a group of scandate&#8208;based substrates with small lattice mismatch and low refractive index compared to that of barium titanate is identified, thus concurrently satisfying high crystal quality and vertical optical mode confinement. This work provides a platform for nonlinear on&#8208;chip optoelectronics and can be promising for waveguide&#8208;based optical devices such as Mach&#8211;Zehnder modulators, wavelength division multiplexing, and quantum optics&#8208;on&#8208;chip.

         <title>Double&#8208; to Single&#8208;Strand Transition Induces Forces and Motion in DNA Origami Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 37, September 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A designed pulling mechanism making use of the entropic spring behavior of single&#8208;stranded DNA is presented. Controlled and reversible motion of two arms of a nanoscale DNA origami structure is shown, resembling the arms of a jumping jack. The opening and closing of the arms are monitored with transmission electron microscopy, super&#8208;resolution microscopy, and dark&#8208;field analysis.








Abstract
The design of dynamic, reconfigurable devices is crucial for the bottom&#8208;up construction of artificial biological systems. DNA can be used as an engineering material for the de&#8208;novo design of such dynamic devices. A self&#8208;assembled DNA origami switch is presented that uses the transition from double&#8208; to single&#8208;stranded DNA and vice versa to create and annihilate an entropic force that drives a reversible conformational change inside the switch. It is distinctively demonstrated that a DNA single&#8208;strand that is extended with 0.34&#160;nm per nucleotide &#8211; the extension this very strand has in the double&#8208;stranded configuration &#8211; exerts a contractive force on its ends leading to large&#8208;scale motion. The operation of this type of switch is demonstrated via transmission electron microscopy, DNA&#8208;PAINT super&#8208;resolution microscopy and darkfield microscopy. The work illustrates the intricate and sometimes counter&#8208;intuitive forces that act in nanoscale physical systems that operate in fluids.

         <title>iSens: A Fiber&#8208;Based, Highly Permeable and Imperceptible Sensor Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 37, September 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Permeable sensors fabricated of paper or glass fibers for measuring the temperature and monitoring the curing of adhesives during production are fabricated. The paper substrate fits seamlessly into the wooden construction material, while in the case of composite materials the glass fibers themselves are electrically functionalized. This technology ushers  in a new generation of imperceptible sensors (iSens) and devices.








Abstract
Embedded sensors are key to optimizing processes and products; they collect data that allow time, energy, and materials to be saved, thereby reducing costs. After production, they remain in place and are used to monitor the long&#8208;term structural health of buildings or aircraft. Fueled by climate change, sustainable construction materials such as wood and fiber composites are gaining importance. Current sensors are not optimized for use with these materials and often act as defects that cause catastrophic failures. Here, flexible, highly permeable, and imperceptible sensors (iSens) are introduced that integrate seamlessly into a component. Their porous substrates are readily infused with adhesives and withstand harsh conditions. In situ resistive temperature measurements and capacitive sensing allows monitoring of adhesives curing as used in wooden structures and fiber composites. The devices also act as heating elements to reduce the hardening time of the glue. Results are analyzed using numerical simulations and theoretical analysis. The suggested iSens technology is widely applicable and represents a step towards realizing the Internet of Things for construction materials.

&lt;p&gt;Permeable sensors fabricated of paper or glass fibers for measuring the temperature and monitoring the curing of adhesives during production are fabricated. The paper substrate fits seamlessly into the wooden construction material, while in the case of composite materials the glass fibers themselves are electrically functionalized. This technology ushers  in a new generation of imperceptible sensors (iSens) and devices.

         <title>3D Laser Displays Based on Circularly Polarized Lasing from Cholesteric Liquid Crystal Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 37, September 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Full&#8208;color 3D laser displays are demonstrated on cholesteric liquid crystal arrays, which comprise two sets of red&#8211;green&#8211;blue (RGB) pixels to present two images with orthogonal circularly polarized laser emissions. Stereoscopic images can be generated in a viewer's mind by fusing the two images acquired by the left and right eyes, respectively.








Abstract
3D laser displays play an important role in next&#8208;generation display technologies owing to the ultimate visual experience they provide. Circularly polarized (CP) laser emissions, featuring optical rotatory power and invariability under rotations, are attractive for 3D displays due to potential in enhancing contrast ratio and comfortability. However, the lack of pixelated self&#8208;emissive CP microlaser arrays as display panels hinders the implementation of 3D laser displays. Here, full&#8208;color 3D laser displays are demonstrated based on CP lasing with inkjet&#8208;printed cholesteric liquid crystal (CLC) arrays as display panels. Individual CP lasers are realized by embedding fluorescent dyes into CLCs with their left&#8208;/right&#8208;handed helical superstructures serving as distributed feedback microcavities, bringing in ultrahigh circular polarization degree values (gem&#160;= 1.6). These CP microlaser pixels exhibit excellent far&#8208;field color&#8208;rendering features and a relatively large color gamut for high&#8208;fidelity displays. With these printed CLC red&#8211;green&#8211;blue (RGB) microlaser arrays serving as display panels, proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept full&#8208;color 3D laser displays are demonstrated via delivering images with orthogonal CP laser emissions into one's left and right eyes. These results provide valuable enlightenment for the development of 3D laser displays.

         <title>Ultrastrong and Ductile Soft Magnetic High&#8208;Entropy Alloys via Coherent Ordered Nanoprecipitates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 37, September 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrastrong and ductile bulk high&#8208;entropy alloys with excellent soft magnetic properties are achieved by introducing a high volume fraction of coherent and ordered nanoprecipitates into the alloy matrix. The high lattice coherency between the homogeneously dispersed nanoprecipitates and the alloy matrix creates only negligible distortion fields on magnetic domain wall motion and contributes significantly to the strength of the material.








Abstract
The lack of strength and damage tolerance can limit the applications of conventional soft magnetic materials (SMMs), particularly in mechanically loaded functional devices. Therefore, strengthening and toughening of SMMs is critically important. However, conventional strengthening concepts usually significantly deteriorate soft magnetic properties, due to Bloch wall interactions with the defects used for hardening. Here a novel concept to overcome this dilemma is proposed, by developing bulk SMMs with excellent mechanical and attractive soft magnetic properties through coherent and ordered nanoprecipitates (&lt;15&#160;nm) dispersed homogeneously within a face&#8208;centered cubic matrix of a non&#8208;equiatomic CoFeNiTaAl high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA). Compared to the alloy in precipitate&#8208;free state, the alloy variant with a large volume fraction (&gt;42%) of nanoprecipitates achieves significantly enhanced strength (&#8776;1526&#160;MPa) at good ductility (&#8776;15%), while the coercivity is only marginally increased (&lt;10.7&#160;Oe). The ordered nanoprecipitates and the resulting dynamic microband refinement in the matrix significantly strengthen the HEAs, while full coherency between the nanoprecipitates and the matrix leads at the same time to the desired insignificant pinning of the magnetic domain walls. The findings provide guidance for developing new high&#8208;performance materials with an excellent combination of mechanical and soft magnetic properties as needed for the electrification of transport and industry.

         <title>17.6%&#8208;Efficient Quasiplanar Heterojunction Organic Solar Cells from a Chlorinated 3D Network Acceptor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 37, September 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quasiplanar heterojunction (Q&#8208;PHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) based on D18 and BTIC&#8208;BO&#8208;4Cl with a 3D network are reported, yielding a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.60%. The results show that the Q&#8208;PHJ architecture can replace the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) architecture to realize excellent OSCs for certain unique donors and acceptors, giving an alternative approach for photovoltaic material design and device fabrication.








Abstract
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) have achieved great success because they overcome the shortcomings of short exciton diffusion distances. With the progress in material innovation and device technology, the efficiency of BHJ devices is continually being improved. For some special photovoltaic material systems, it is difficult to manipulate the miscibility and morphology of blend films, and this results in moderate, even poor device performance. Quasiplanar heterojunction (Q&#8208;PHJ) OSCs have been proposed to exploit the excellent photovoltaic properties of these materials. An OSC with BTIC&#8208;BO&#8208;4Cl has a 3D interpenetrating network structure with multiple channels that can facilitate the exciton diffusion and charge transport, and BTIC&#8208;BO&#8208;4Cl is therefore a good candidate for Q&#8208;PHJ OSCs. In this work, a D18:BTIC&#8208;BO&#8208;4Cl&#8208;based Q&#8208;PHJ device is fabricated. The exciton diffusion lengths of D18 and BTIC&#8208;BO&#8208;4Cl&#160;are in accord with&#160;the requirements of the Q&#8208;PHJ device and the efficiency of Q&#8208;PHJ device is as high as 17.60%. This study indicates that the Q&#8208;PHJ architecture can replace the BHJ architecture to produce excellent OSCs for certain unique donors and acceptors, providing an alternative approach to photovoltaic material design and device fabrication.

         <title>Regioregular Narrow&#8208;Bandgap n&#8208;Type Polymers with High Electron Mobility Enabling Highly Efficient All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 37, September 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regioregular narrow&#8208;bandgap n&#8208;type polymer, L15, is synthesized, showing higher electron mobility and larger absorption coefficient compared to its random analog. When applied as an electron acceptor in all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs), L15 yields outstanding efficiencies of 15.2% and 16.2% in binary and ternary all&#8208;PSCs, respectively.








Abstract
Narrow&#8208;bandgap n&#8208;type polymers with high electron mobility are urgently demanded for the development of all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs). Here, two regioregular narrow&#8208;bandgap polymer acceptors, L15 and MBTI, with two electron&#8208;deficient segments are synthesized by copolymerizing two dibrominated fused&#8208;ring electron acceptors (FREA) with distannylated aromatic imide, respectively. Taking full advantage of the FREA and the imide, both polymer acceptors show narrow bandgap and high electron mobility. Benefiting from the more extended absorption, better backbone ordering, and higher electron mobility than those of its regiorandom analog, the L15&#8208;based all&#8208;PSC yields a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.2% when blended with the polymer donor PM6. More importantly, MBTI incorporating a benzothiophene&#8208;core FREA segment shows relatively higher frontier molecular orbital levels than L15, forming a cascade&#8208;like energy level alignment with L15 and PM6. Based on this, ternary all&#8208;PSCs are designed where MBTI is introduced as a guest into the PM6:L15 host system. Thanks to further optimal blend morphology and more balanced charge transport, the PCE is improved up to 16.2%, which is among the highest values for all&#8208;PSCs. The results demonstrate that combining an FREA and an aromatic imide to construct regioregular narrow&#8208;bandgap polymer acceptors provides an effective approach to fabricate highly efficient all&#8208;PSCs.

More importantly, MBTI incorporating a benzothiophene-core FREA segment shows relatively higher frontier molecular orbital levels than L15, forming a cascade-like energy level alignment with L15 and PM6. Based on this, ternary all-PSCs are designed where MBTI is introduced as a guest into the PM6:L15 host system. Thanks to further optimal blend morphology and more balanced charge transport, the PCE is improved up to 16.2%, which is among the highest values for all-PSCs. The results demonstrate that combining an FREA and an aromatic imide to construct regioregular narrow-bandgap polymer acceptors provides an effective approach to fabricate highly efficient all-PSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tellurium Single&#8208;Crystal Arrays by Low&#8208;Temperature Evaporation and Crystallization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 37, September 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kinetics and dynamics of the crystallization of thermally evaporated amorphous Te films are studied. Single&#8208;crystalline tellurium arrays are demonstrated by controlling the crystallization pathway of the evaporated Te films. Field&#8208;effect transistors based on the evaporated Te single crystals exhibit an average effective hole mobility of &#8776;100 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and on/off ratio of &#8776;3 &#215; 104.








Abstract
Thermally evaporated tellurium possesses an intriguing crystallization behavior, where an amorphous to crystalline phase transition happens at near&#8208;ambient temperature. However, a comprehensive understanding and delicate control of the crystallization process for the evaporated Te films is lacking. Here, the kinetics and dynamics of the crystallization of thermally evaporated Te films is visualized and modeled. Low&#8208;temperature processing of highly crystalline tellurium films with large grain size and preferred out&#8208;of&#8208;plane orientation ((100) plane parallel to the surface) is demonstrated by controlling the crystallization process. Tellurium single crystals with a lateral dimension of up to 6&#160;&#181;m are realized on various substrates including glass and plastic. Field&#8208;effect transistors based on 5&#160;&#176;C crystallized Te single grains (6&#8208;nm&#8208;thick) exhibit an average effective hole mobility of &#8776;100 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, and on/off current ratio of &#8776;3 &#215; 104.

         <title>Au&#8208;Doped Ag2Te Quantum Dots with Bright NIR&#8208;IIb Fluorescence for In Situ Monitoring of Angiogenesis and Arteriogenesis in a Hindlimb Ischemic Model</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 37, September 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel near&#8208;infrared IIb fluorescent probe of Au&#8208;doped Ag2Te (Au:Ag2Te) quantum dots (QDs) is developed through a facile cation exchange method. The Au:Ag2Te QDs exhibit photoluminescence (PL) emission at 1600&#160;nm and a much&#8208;enhanced PL intensity of &#8776;12 fold compared to Ag2Te QDs at a doping amount of 4% (Au/Ag).








Abstract
Fluorescence located in 1500&#8211;1700&#160;nm (denoted as the near&#8208;infrared IIb window, NIR&#8208;IIb) has drawn great interest for bioimaging, owing to its ultrahigh tissue penetration depth and spatiotemporal resolution. Therefore, NIR&#8208;IIb fluorescent probes with high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and stability along with high biocompatibility are urgently pursued. Herein, a novel NIR&#8208;IIb fluorescent probe of Au&#8208;doped Ag2Te (Au:Ag2Te) quantum dots (QDs) is developed via a facile cation exchange method. The Au dopant concentration in the Ag2Te QDs is tunable from 0% to 10% by controlling the ratio of supplied Au precursor to Ag2Te QDs, resulting in a wide range of PL emission in the NIR&#8208;IIb window and a much&#8208;enhanced PL intensity. After surface modification, the Au:Ag2Te QDs possess bright NIR&#8208;IIb emission, high colloidal stability and photostability, and decent biocompatibility. Further, in vivo monitoring of the process of angiogenesis and arteriogenesis in an ischemic hindlimb is successfully performed.

         <title>High Resolution Patterning of an Organic&#8211;Inorganic Photoresin for the Fabrication of Platinum Microstructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 37, September 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;resolution patterning of an organic&#8211;inorganic platinum containing photoresin by microlithography and two&#8208;photon polymerization is demonstrated. The polymerized microstructures are debinded and reduced to highly conductive metallic platinum at a resolution of 300 nm. The conductivity of  the reduced platinum structures is 67% of the conductivity of bulk platinum.








Abstract
Platinum (Pt) is an interesting material for many applications due to its high chemical resilience, outstanding catalytic activity, high electrical conductivity, and high melting point. However, microstructuring and especially 3D microstructuring of platinum is a complex process, based on expensive and specialized equipment often suffering from very slow processing speeds. In this work, organic&#8211;inorganic photoresins, which can be structured using direct optical lithography as well as two&#8208;photon lithography (TPL) with submicrometer resolution and high&#8208;throughput is presented. The printed structures are subsequently converted to high&#8208;purity platinum using thermal debinding of the binder and reduction of the salt. With this technique, complex 3D structures with a 3D resolution of 300&#160;nm were&#160;fabricated. At a layer thickness of 35&#160;nm, the patterns reach a high conductivity of 67% compared to bulk platinum. Microheaters, thermocouple sensors as well as a Lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;Chip system are presented as exemplary applications. This technology will enable a broad range of application from electronics, sensing and heating elements to 3D photonics and metamaterials.

         <title>Ultrathin Multibridge Channel Transistor Enabled by van der Waals Assembly</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 37, September 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D ultrathin multibridge channel field&#8208;effect transistor (MBCFET), constructed based on 2&#160;nm/2&#160;nm MoS2 channels is demonstrated. This two&#8208;level&#8208;stacked MBCFET exhibits an on&#8211;off current ratio of up to 4&#160;&#215;&#160;108 with a theoretical minimum subthreshold swing value (60&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1) at room temperature.








Abstract
Multibridge channel field&#8208;effect transistors (MBCFETs) enable improved gate control and flow of a large drive current and they are regarded as promising candidates for next&#8208;generation transistor architecture. However, in achieving a larger drive current with a thinner channel, limitations arise from the decrease in mobility when the thickness of the Si nanosheet is less than 5&#160;nm. In addition, an increase in the leakage current is unavoidable when a large number of channels are stacked. Here, a 2D ultrathin MBCFET is demonstrate, constructed based on 2&#160;nm/2&#160;nm MoS2 channels. The normalized drive current (23.11 &#181;A*&#181;m&#160;&#181;m&#8722;1) in each level channel of this MBCFET exceeds that of the latest seven&#8208;level&#8208;stacked Si MBCFET, while the leakage current is only 0.4% of this value, with the subthreshold swing reaching 60&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1 and an on/off ratio reaching up to 4&#160;&#215;&#160;108 at room temperature. Furthermore, the drive current of this 2D ultrathin MBCFET can be further increased by regulating the polarity of the operation voltage to reduce the injection barrier. The combination of 2D materials and an MBC structure has the potential for use in high&#8208;performance and low&#8208;power&#8208;consumption electronics.

         <title>An Anti&#8208;Fatigue Design Strategy for 3D Ribbon&#8208;Shaped Flexible Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 37, September 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anti&#8208;fatigue strategy to significantly prolong the fatigue life of 3D ribbon&#8208;shaped flexible electronics by switching metal&#8208;dominated failure to the desired polymer&#8208;dominated failure is presented. Combined in situ measurements and computations allow the establishment of a failure criterion capable of accurately predicting fatigue life under compressions, thereby providing useful guidelines for the design of anti&#8208;fatigue mesostructures with diverse 3D geometries.








Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) flexible electronics represent an emerging area of intensive attention in recent years, owing to their broad&#8208;ranging applications in wearable electronics, flexible robots, tissue/cell scaffolds, among others. The widely adopted 3D conductive mesostructures in the functional device systems would inevitably undergo repetitive out&#8208;of&#8208;plane compressions during practical operations, and thus, anti&#8208;fatigue design strategies are of great significance to improve the reliability of 3D flexible electronics. Previous studies mainly focused on the fatigue failure behavior of planar ribbon&#8208;shaped geometries, while anti&#8208;fatigue design strategies and predictive failure criteria addressing 3D ribbon&#8208;shaped mesostructures are still lacking. This work demonstrates an anti&#8208;fatigue strategy to significantly prolong the fatigue life of 3D ribbon&#8208;shaped flexible electronics by switching the metal&#8208;dominated failure to desired polymer&#8208;dominated failure. Combined in situ measurements and computational studies allow the establishment of a failure criterion capable of accurately predicting fatigue lives under out&#8208;of&#8208;plane compressions, thereby providing useful guidelines for the design of anti&#8208;fatigue mesostructures with diverse 3D geometries. Two mechanically reliable 3D devices, including a resistance&#8208;type vibration sensor and a janus sensor capable of decoupled temperature measurements, serve as two demonstrative examples to highlight potential applications in long&#8208;term health monitoring and human&#8208;like robotic perception, respectively.

         <title>Strong Suppression of Thermal Conductivity in the Presence of Long Terminal Alkyl Chains in Low&#8208;Disorder Molecular Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 37, September 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A significant drop in in&#8208;plane thermal conductivity upon end alkylation of  the aromatic rings of dinaphtho[2,3&#8208;b:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;f]thieno[3,2&#8208;b] thiophene (DNTT), which is understood from a detailed vibrational&#8208;mode analysis, is identified via a comprehensive experimental and theoretical investigation. Combined with their enhanced charge transport, the results suggest the possibility of decoupling electron and phonon transport in alkylated DNTT systems, which opens pathways for improved thermoelectric applications.








Abstract
While the charge transport properties of organic semiconductors have been extensively studied over the recent years, the field of organics&#8208;based thermoelectrics is still limited by a lack of experimental data on thermal transport and of understanding of the associated structure&#8211;property relationships. To fill this gap, a comprehensive experimental and theoretical investigation of the lattice thermal conductivity in polycrystalline thin films of dinaphtho[2,3&#8208;b:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;f]thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene (Cn&#8208;DNTT&#8208;Cn with n&#160;= 0, 8) semiconductors is reported. Strikingly, thermal conductivity appears to be much more isotropic than charge transport, which is confined to the 2D molecular layers. A direct comparison between experimental measurements (3&#969;&#8211;V&#246;lklein method) and theoretical estimations (approach&#8208;to&#8208;equilibrium molecular dynamics (AEMD) method) indicates that the in&#8208;plane thermal conductivity is strongly reduced in the presence of the long terminal alkyl chains. This evolution can be rationalized by the strong localization of the intermolecular vibrational modes in C8&#8208;DNTT&#8208;C8 in comparison to unsubstituted DNTT cores, as evidenced by a vibrational mode analysis. Combined with the enhanced charge transport properties of alkylated DNTT systems, this opens the possibility to decouple electron and phonon transport in these materials, which provides great potential for enhancing the thermoelectric figure of merit ZT.

Spatial Structure Reconstruction
In article number 2100866, Jiangfeng Yang, Libo Li, and co&#8208;workers, through optimized spatial structure reconstruction, build TYUT&#8208;96Cr, composed of three kinds of small pore cages using Cr and trimesic acid. Benefitting from the high&#8208;density open Cr sites in the structure, this material features record N2 adsorption volume capacity and N2/O2 separation selectivity, and is practically useful for upmarket industrial applications.

Arsenical Drugs
In article number 2102054, Aiguo Wu, Tian Xie, Wei Tao, and co&#8208;workers reveal PEGylated arsenene nanodots (AsNDs@PEG) with high monoelemental arsenic purity and negligible systemic toxicity as a new&#8208;concept arsenical drug. This AsNDs@PEG, when applied in a low&#8208;dose combination strategy with &#946;&#8208;elemene, a plant&#8208;derived anticancer drug, achieves synergistic therapeutic outcomes.

Paper&#8208;Based Sensors
iSens are flexible, foldable, and translucent paper&#8208;based sensors. The porous substrates consist of a fiber structure that is highly permeable to liquids. Interdigital electrodes made of ultrathin copper are individually designed by one step laser ablation. This iSens platform, presented by Martin Kaltenbrunner and co&#8208;workers in article number 2102736, will contribute to a new generation of imperceptible sensors seamlessly integrated into smart composite materials.

Fatigue Life
In article number 2102684, Yihui Zhang and co&#8208;workers present an antifatigue strategy to prolong the fatigue life of 3D ribbon&#8208;shaped electronics by switching the metal&#8208;dominated failure to polymer&#8208;dominated. Combined measurements and computations allow establishment of a failure criterion capable of predicting fatigue life under compressions, thereby providing useful guidelines for the design of antifatigue flexible electronics with diverse 3D geometries.

         <title>Frontiers in Theoretical Analysis of Solid Electrolyte Interphase Formation Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 37, September 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nature of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formed on battery electrodes governs the performance and safety of current and post&#8208;Li&#8208;ion batteries. However, it has been unclear how reaction products of an electrolyte interact and aggregate to form the final SEI. The morphological growth mechanism of the SEI, as revealed by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art theoretical simulation methodologies, is highlighted.








Abstract
Solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is an ion conductive yet electron&#8208;insulating layer on battery electrodes, which is formed by the reductive decomposition of electrolytes during the initial charge. The nature of the SEI significantly impacts the safety, power, and lifetime of the batteries. Hence, elucidating the formation mechanism of the SEI layer has become a top priority. Conventional theoretical calculations reveal initial elementary steps of electrolyte reductive decomposition, whereas experimental approaches mainly focus on the characterization of the formed SEI in the final form. Moreover, both theoretical and experimental methodologies could not approach intermediate or transient steps of SEI growth. A major breakthrough has recently been achieved through a novel multiscale simulation method, which has enriched the understanding of how the reduction products are aggregated near the electrode and influence the SEI morphologies. This review highlights recent theoretical achievements to reveal the growth mechanism and provides a clear guideline for designing a stable SEI layer for advanced batteries.

         <title>Black Phosphorus/Polymers: Status and Challenges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 37, September 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>

Abstract
As a newly emerged mono&#8208;elemental nanomaterial, black phosphorus (BP) has been widely investigated for its fascinating physical properties, including layer&#8208;dependent tunable band gap (0.3&#8211;1.5 eV), high ON/OFF ratio (104), high carrier mobility (103 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1), excellent mechanical resistance, as well as special in&#8208;plane anisotropic optical, thermal, and vibrational characteristics. However, the instability caused by chemical degradation of its surface has posed a severe challenge for its further applications. A focused BP/polymer strategy has more recently been developed and implemented to hurdle this issue, so at present BP/polymers have been developed that exhibit enhanced stability, as well as outstanding optical, thermal, mechanical, and electrical properties. This has promoted researchers to further explore the potential applications of black phosphorous. In this review, the preparation processes and the key properties of BP/polymers are reviewed, followed by a detailed account of their diversified applications, including areas like optoelectronics, bio&#8208;medicine, and energy storage. Finally, in accordance with the current progress, the prospective challenges and future directions are highlighted and discussed.

&lt;p&gt;As a newly emerged mono-elemental nanomaterial, black phosphorus (BP) has been widely investigated for its fascinating physical properties, including layer-dependent tunable band gap (0.3&#8211;1.5 eV), high ON/OFF ratio (10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;), high carrier mobility (10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), excellent mechanical resistance, as well as special in-plane anisotropic optical, thermal, and vibrational characteristics. However, the instability caused by chemical degradation of its surface has posed a severe challenge for its further applications. A focused BP/polymer strategy has more recently been developed and implemented to hurdle this issue, so at present BP/polymers have been developed that exhibit enhanced stability, as well as outstanding optical, thermal, mechanical, and electrical properties. This has promoted researchers to further explore the potential applications of black phosphorous. In this review, the preparation processes and the key properties of BP/polymers are reviewed, followed by a detailed account of their diversified applications, including areas like optoelectronics, bio-medicine, and energy storage. Finally, in accordance with the current progress, the prospective challenges and future directions are highlighted and discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Identification of the Key Parameters for Horizontal Transition Dipole Orientation in Fluorescent and TADF Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 37, September 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Horizontal emitter orientation can significantly increase the efficiency of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. Intense research over the past decade has provided a large amount of data on the factors that may drive horizontal orientation of organic emitters. This research is reviewed, and a meta&#8208;analysis of the data is combined with quantum&#8208;chemical calculations to identify key parameters that influence this orientation.








Abstract
In organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), horizontal orientation of the emissive transition dipole moment (TDM) can improve light outcoupling efficiency by up to 50% relative to random orientation. Therefore, there have been extensive efforts to identify drivers of horizontal orientation. The aspect ratio of the emitter molecule and the glass&#8208;transition temperature (Tg) of the films are currently regarded as particularly important. However, there remains a paucity of systematic studies that establish the extent to which these and other parameters control orientation in the wide range of emitter systems relevant for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art OLEDs. Here, recent work on molecular orientation of fluorescent and thermally activated delayed fluorescent emitters in vacuum&#8208;processed OLEDs is reviewed. Additionally, to identify parameters linked to TDM orientation, a meta&#8208;analysis of 203 published emitter systems is conducted and combined with density&#8208;functional theory calculations. Molecular weight (MW) and linearity are identified as key parameters in neat systems. In host&#8211;guest systems with low&#8208;MW emitters, orientation is mostly influenced by the host Tg, whereas the length and MW of the emitter become more relevant for systems involving higher&#8208;MW emitters. To close, a perspective of where the field must advance to establish a comprehensive model of molecular orientation is given.

         <title>Photoresponsive and Polarization&#8208;Sensitive Structural Colors from Cellulose/Liquid Crystal Nanophotonic Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polarization&#8208;sensitive and photoresponsive nanophotonic system based on structural colors that are generated by cellulose nanocrystal films and modulated by a birefringent liquid crystal coating is presented. Intense structural colors are appealingly varied by altering the handedness of the illuminating circularly polarized light. The system is further made photoresponsive using a UV&#8208;light&#8208;sensitive liquid crystal mixture.








Abstract
Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) possess the ability to form helical periodic structures that generate structural colors. Due to the helicity, such self&#8208;assembled cellulose structures preferentially reflect left&#8208;handed circularly polarized light of certain colors, while they remain transparent to right&#8208;handed circularly polarized light. This study shows that combination with a liquid crystal enables modulation of the optical response to obtain light reflection of both handedness but with reversed spectral profiles. As a result, the nanophotonic systems provide vibrant structural colors that are tunable via the incident light polarization. The results are attributed to the liquid crystal aligning on the CNC/glucose film, to form a birefringent layer that twists the incident light polarization before interaction with the chiral cellulose nanocomposite. Using a photoresponsive liquid crystal, this effect can further be turned off by exposure to UV light, which switches the nematic liquid crystal into a nonbirefringent isotropic phase. The study highlights the potential of hybrid cellulose systems to create self&#8208;assembled yet advanced photoresponsive and polarization&#8208;tunable nanophotonics.

         <title>Chiral Phonons and Giant Magneto&#8208;Optical Effect in CrBr3 2D Magnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phonon chirality and magneto&#8208;optical phenomena in CrBr3 2D magnet are reported. The superposition of doubly degenerate Eg modes results in chiral phonons with PAM of l&#160;=&#160;&#177;1, exhibiting isotropic linearly polarized Raman scattering. The non&#8208;degenerate Ag modes display a giant magneto&#8208;optical effect under an external out&#8208;of&#8208;plane magnetic field, rotating the plane of polarization of the scattered linearly polarized light.








Abstract
Phonons with chirality determine the optical helicity of inelastic light scattering processes due to their nonzero angular momentum. Here it is shown that 2D magnetic CrBr3 hosts chiral phonons at the Brillouin&#8208;zone center. These chiral phonons are linear combinations of the doubly&#8208;degenerate Eg phonons, and the phonon eigenmodes exhibit clockwise and counterclockwise rotational vibrations corresponding to angular momenta of l = &#177; 1.&#160;Such Eg chiral phonons completely switch the polarization of incident circularly polarized light. On the other hand, the non&#8208;degenerate non&#8208;chiral Ag phonons display a giant magneto&#8208;optical effect under an external out&#8208;of&#8208;plane magnetic field, rotating the plane of polarization of the scattered linearly polarized light. The corresponding degree of polarization of the scattered light changes from 91% to &#8722;68% as the magnetic field strength increases from 0 to 5 T. In contrast, the chiral Eg modes display no field dependence. The results lay a foundation for the study of phonon chirality and magneto&#8208;optical phenomena in 2D magnetic materials, as well as their related applications, such as the phonon Hall effect, topological photonics, and Raman lasing.

         <title>Machine Learning to Predict Quasicrystals from Chemical Compositions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quasicrystals are long&#8208;range ordered materials that exhibit rotational symmetries disallowed for periodic crystals. Since the first discovery of a quasicrystal in 1984, 100 or so thermodynamically stable quasicrystals have been found, but the pace of the discovery has been slowing down significantly in recent years. Machine&#8208;learning technologies open up the door to the accelerated discovery of new quasicrystals.








Abstract
Quasicrystals have emerged as the third class of solid&#8208;state materials, distinguished from periodic crystals and amorphous solids, which have long&#8208;range order without periodicity exhibiting rotational symmetries that are disallowed for periodic crystals in most cases. To date, more than one hundred stable quasicrystals have been reported, leading to the discovery of many new and exciting phenomena. However, the pace of the discovery of new quasicrystals has lowered in recent years, largely owing to the lack of clear guiding principles for the synthesis of new quasicrystals. Here, it is shown that the discovery of new quasicrystals can be accelerated with a simple machine&#8208;learning workflow. With a list of the chemical compositions of known stable quasicrystals, approximant crystals, and ordinary crystals, a prediction model is trained to solve the three&#8208;class classification task and its predictability compared to the observed phase diagrams of ternary aluminum systems is evaluated. The validation experiments strongly support the superior predictive power of machine learning, with the overall prediction accuracy of the phase prediction task reaching &#8776;0.728. Furthermore, analyzing the input&#8211;output relationships black&#8208;boxed into the model, nontrivial empirical equations interpretable by humans that describe conditions necessary for stable quasicrystal formation are&#160;identified.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Independent Photocleavage of Radical Nanogenerator for Near&#8208;IR&#8208;Gated and H2O&#8208;Mediated Free&#8208;Radical Nanotherapy</title>

An interesting paradigm of oxygen&#8208;irrelevant photoactivated chemotherapy (PACT) via near&#8208;IR&#8208;gated and H2O&#8208;mediated photocleavage based on engineered yolk&#8211;shell upconversion of mesoporous silica nanoparticle nanomedicines to augment the therapeutic efficacy of PACT nanoagents for cancer treatment is reported.








Abstract
The oxygen&#8208;dependent nature and limited penetration capacity of visible light render the low efficiency of photodynamic therapy in hypoxic and deep&#8208;seated tumors. Therefore, the development of oxygen&#8208;free photoactivated chemotherapy (PACT) to generate cytotoxic reactive oxygen species by near&#8208;IR (NIR) light&#8208;cleavable photocages is in high demand. Here, an oxygen&#8208;irrelevant PACT strategy based on NIR light&#8208;triggered hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH) generation is developed for free&#8208;radical nanotherapy. Blebbistatin&#8208;loaded upconversion of mesoporous silica nanoparticles (UCSNs&#8208;B) is established to facilitate the high loading efficiency of blebbistatin and implement the efficient transformation of NIR light into blue light for unprecedented direct photorelease of oxygen&#8208;independent &#8226;OH. Under NIR laser irradiation, UCSNs&#8208;B converted NIR light into blue light, thus enabling the photocleavage of blebbistatin to induce the burst of &#8226;OH. The &#8226;OH burst under NIR laser irradiation further induces cancer cell apoptosis and significant suppression of hypoxic tumors. In addition, the gadolinium ion (Gd3+)&#8208;doped UCSNs&#8208;B are used as contrast agents in magnetic resonance imaging to facilitate real&#8208;time monitoring of the therapeutic processes. This study effectively demonstrates that the UCSNs&#8208;B act as NIR light&#8208;triggered photocages to facilitate oxygen&#8208;irrelevant &#8226;OH bursts, thus providing insights into the development of efficient PACT nanoagents for cancer treatment.

         <title>Controlling Surface Wettability for Automated In Situ Array Synthesis and Direct Bioscreening</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amphiphilic coating for glass surfaces is reported, on which small droplets of polar aprotic organic solvents can be deposited with enhanced contact angle (small feature size) and inhibited motion (strong binding), permitting fully automated multiple rounds of combinatorial synthesis of small&#8208;molecule compounds and peptides. The amphiphilic coating can be switched to hydrophilic network for protein&#8208; and cell&#8208;based screening.








Abstract
The in situ synthesis of biomolecules on glass surfaces for direct bioscreening can be a powerful tool in the fields of pharmaceutical sciences, biomaterials, and chemical biology. However, it is still challenging to 1) achieve this conventional multistep combinatorial synthesis on glass surfaces with small feature sizes and high yields and 2) develop a surface which is compatible with solid&#8208;phase syntheses, as well as the subsequent bioscreening. This work reports an amphiphilic coating of a glass surface on which small droplets of polar aprotic organic solvents can be deposited with an enhanced contact angle and inhibited motion to permit fully automated multiple rounds of the combinatorial synthesis of small&#8208;molecule compounds and peptides. This amphiphilic coating can be switched into a hydrophilic network for protein&#8208; and cell&#8208;based screening. Employing this in situ synthesis method, chemical space can be probed via array technology with unprecedented speed for various applications, such as lead discovery/optimization in medicinal chemistry and biomaterial development.

         <title>Production of Multiple Cell&#8208;Laden Microtissue Spheroids with a Biomimetic Hepatic&#8208;Lobule&#8208;Like Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A technique for producing multicellular microtissue spheroids using bioprinting and a microfluidic emulsification system is presented. Spheroids with the biomimetic structure of liver lobules are produced with high throughput and uniform size. The spheroids with biomimetic structure show enhanced functionalities and stable structural integrity. In addition, the in vivo study reveals enhanced engraftment potential of the structured spheroids.








Abstract
The construction of an in vitro 3D cellular model to mimic the human liver is highly desired for drug discovery and clinical applications, such as patient&#8208;specific treatment and cell&#8208;based therapy in regenerative medicine. However, current bioprinting strategies are limited in their ability to generate multiple cell&#8208;laden microtissues with biomimetic structures. This study presents a method for producing hepatic&#8208;lobule&#8208;like microtissue spheroids using a bioprinting system incorporating a precursor cartridge and microfluidic emulsification system. The multiple cell&#8208;laden microtissue spheroids can be successfully generated at a speed of approximately 45 spheroids min&#8722;1 and with a uniform diameter. Hepatic and endothelial cells are patterned in a microtissue spheroid with the biomimetic structure of a liver lobule. The spheroids allow long&#8208;term culture with high cell viability, and the structural integrity is maintained longer than that of non&#8208;structured spheroids. Furthermore, structured spheroids show high MRP2, albumin, and CD31 expression levels. In addition, the in vivo study reveals that structured microtissue spheroids are stably engrafted. These results demonstrate that the method provides a valuable 3D structured microtissue spheroid model with lobule&#8208;like constructs and liver functions.

         <title>Electric Field Control of the Magnetic Weyl Fermion in an Epitaxial SrRuO3 (111) Thin Film</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electric field control of the magnetic Weyl fermion is achieved in an epitaxial SrRuO3 (111) film, the topological property of which is identified with the help of magnetotransport measurements, angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), and first&#8208;principles calculations.








Abstract
The magnetic Weyl fermion originates from the time reversal symmetry (TRS)&#8208;breaking in magnetic crystalline structures, where the topology and magnetism entangle with each other. Therefore, the magnetic Weyl fermion is expected to be effectively tuned by the magnetic field and electrical field, which holds promise for future topologically protected electronics. However, the electrical field control of the magnetic Weyl fermion has rarely been reported, which is prevented by the limited number of identified magnetic Weyl solids. Here, the electric field control of the magnetic Weyl fermion is demonstrated in an epitaxial SrRuO3 (111) thin film. The magnetic Weyl fermion in the SrRuO3 films is indicated by the chiral anomaly induced magnetotransport, and is verified by the observed Weyl nodes in the electronic structures characterized by the angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and first&#8208;principles calculations. Through the ionic&#8208;liquid gating experiment, the effective manipulation of the Weyl fermion by electric field is demonstrated, in terms of the sign&#8208;change of the ordinary Hall effect, the nonmonotonic tuning of the anomalous Hall effect, and the observation of the linear magnetoresistance under proper gating voltages. The work may stimulate the searching and tuning of Weyl fermions in other magnetic materials, which are promising in energy&#8208;efficient electronics.

However, the electrical field control of the magnetic Weyl fermion has rarely been reported, which is prevented by the limited number of identified magnetic Weyl solids. Here, the electric field control of the magnetic Weyl fermion is demonstrated in an epitaxial SrRuO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (111) thin film. The magnetic Weyl fermion in the SrRuO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; films is indicated by the chiral anomaly induced magnetotransport, and is verified by the observed Weyl nodes in the electronic structures characterized by the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and first-principles calculations. Through the ionic-liquid gating experiment, the effective manipulation of the Weyl fermion by electric field is demonstrated, in terms of the sign-change of the ordinary Hall effect, the nonmonotonic tuning of the anomalous Hall effect, and the observation of the linear magnetoresistance under proper gating voltages. The work may stimulate the searching and tuning of Weyl fermions in other magnetic materials, which are promising in energy-efficient electronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Universal Compensation Strategy to Anchor Polar Organic Molecules in Bilayered Hydrated Vanadates for Promoting Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal compensation strategy is reported to introduce polar organic molecules into the interlayer of AlxV2O5&#183;nH2O by replacing partial crystal water. Owing to the high&#8208;polar carbonyl/sulfenyl and low&#8208;polar alkyl, the organic molecules display a strong interaction with pre&#8208;intercalated Al3+ and a weak interaction with Zn2+. Consequently, the cathode displays superior structural stability and ion transfer kinetics, leading to excellent performance.








Abstract
The electrochemical performance of layered vanadium oxides is often improved by introducing guest species into their interlayer. Guest species with high stability in the interlayer and weak interaction with Zn2+ during charge/discharge process are desired to promoting reversible Zn2+ transfer. Herein, a universal compensation strategy was&#160;developed to introduce various polar organic molecules into the interlayer of AlxV2O5&#183;nH2O by replacing partial crystal water. The high&#8208;polar groups in the organic molecules have a strong electrostatic attraction with pre&#8208;intercalated Al3+, which ensures that organic molecules can be anchored in the interlayer of hydrated vanadates. Simultaneously, the low&#8208;polar groups endow organic molecules with a weak interaction with Zn2+ during cycling, thus liberalizing reversible Zn2+ transfer. As a result, AlxV2O5 with polar organic molecules displays enhanced electrochemical performance. Furthermore, based on above cathode material, a pouch cell was&#160;assembled by further integrating a dendrite&#8208;free N&#8208;doped carbon nanofiber@Zn anode, displaying an energy density of 50&#160;Wh kg&#8208;1. This work provides a path for designing stable guest species with a weak interaction with Zn2+ in the interlayer of layered vanadium oxide towards high&#8208;performance cathode materials of aqueous Zn batteries.

         <title>Side Area&#8208;Assisted 3D Evaporator with Antibiofouling Function for Ultra&#8208;Efficient Solar Steam Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solar&#8208;driven interfacial steam generation (SISG) system involving an all&#8208;fiber porous cylinder&#8208;like foam 3D evaporator, side area&#8208;assisted evaporation protocol, and aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission&#8208;active solar absorber is explored. The SISG system exhibits a high solar evaporation rate of 3.6&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1, and shows photodynamic killing of bacteria to prevent biofouling.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven interfacial steam generation (SISG) has been recognized as a promising strategy to solve water shortages in an eco&#8208;friendly and low&#8208;cost way. However, the practical application of SISG is vitally restricted by some inherent limits, especially for finite evaporation rate and insufficient working life of evaporator. Herein, a novel SISG system involving an all&#8208;fiber porous cylinder&#8208;like foam 3D evaporator, side area&#8208;assisted evaporation protocol, and aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission&#8208;active solar absorber with &#8220;one stone two birds&#8221; function is explored. The solar absorber exhibits efficient photothermal conversion, endowing the side area&#8208;assisted evaporator with as high as 3.6&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 of solar evaporation rate, which is highly desirable for SISG under 1 sun of irradiation. Moreover, the solar absorber is capable of powerfully producing reactive oxygen species upon sunlight irradiation, which results in extraordinary photodynamic killing of bacteria nearby the fiber to prevent biofouling, consequently improving the working life of evaporator.

         <title>Titania&#8208;Supported Ni2P/Ni Catalysts for Selective Solar&#8208;Driven CO Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Titania&#8208;supported Ni2P/Ni nanoparticle catalysts, obtained through a facile gas&#8211;solid reaction strategy, show a remarkable C2+ selectivity of 70% for solar&#8208;driven CO hydrogenation. Conversely, CO methanation is the dominant process for metallic Ni nanoparticles in the absence of Ni2P. The results reveal a simple phosphidation strategy for tuning the selectivity of Ni&#8208;based catalysts for selective CO hydrogenation to value&#8208;added hydrocarbons.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven Fischer&#8211;Tropsch synthesis (FTS) holds great potential for the sustainable production of fuels from syngas and solar energy. However, the selectivity toward multi&#8208;carbon products (C2+) is often hampered by the difficulty in the regulation of transition metals acting as both light absorption units and active sites. Herein, a partial phosphidation strategy to prepare titania supported Ni2P/Ni catalysts for photothermal FTS is demonstrated. Under Xenon lamp or concentrated sunlight irradiation, the optimized catalyst shows a C2+ selectivity of 70% at a CO conversion of &gt;20%.&#160;Conversely, nickel metal in the absence of Ni2P delivers negligible C2+ products (&#8776;1%) with methane being the major product (&gt;90%). Structural characterization and density functional theory calculation reveal that the partial phosphidation allows exposed metallic Ni to be active for CO adsorption and activation, while the existence of Ni2P/Ni interface is responsible to inhibit CO methanation and promote C&#8211;C coupling of adsorbed *CH intermediates. This work introduces a novel phosphidation strategy for nickel&#8208;based photothermal catalysts in efficiently harnessing solar energy, and regulating the reaction pathways for CO hydrogenation to deliver high value products.

         <title>A Robust Narrow Bandgap Vanadium Tetrasulfide Sonosensitizer Optimized by Charge Separation Engineering for Enhanced Sonodynamic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vanadium tetrasulfide is presented as a new generation of robust narrow&#8208;bandgap sonosensitizer for sonodynamic therapy. The charge separation engineering strategy is also demonstrated to be highly efficient in optimizing its sono&#8208;catalytic performance. Besides, such nanoplatforms are capable of reshaping tumor microenvironments to achieve an excellent tumor therapeutic effect.








Abstract
The development and optimization of sonosensitizers for elevating intratumoral reactive oxygen species (ROS) are definitely appealing in current sonodynamic therapy (SDT). Given this, branched vanadium tetrasulfide (VS4) nanodendrites with a narrower bandgap (compared with the most extensively explored sonosensitizers) are presented as a new source of sonosensitizer, which allows a more effortless separation of sono&#8208;triggered electron&#8211;hole pairs for ROS generation. Specifically, platinum (Pt) nanoparticles and endogenous high levels of glutathione (GSH) are rationally engineered to further optimize its sono&#8208;sensitized performance. As cocatalyst, Pt is conducive to trapping electrons, whereas GSH, as a natural hole&#8208;scavenger, tends to capture holes. Compared with the pristine VS4 sonosensitizer, the GSH&#8208;Pt&#8208;VS4 nanocomposite can greatly prolong the lifetime of the charge and confer a highly efficacious ROS production activity. Furthermore, such nanoplatforms are capable of reshaping tumor microenvironments to realize ROS overproduction, contributed by overcoming tumor hypoxia to improve SDT&#8208;triggered singlet oxygen production, catalyzing endogenic hydrogen peroxide into destructive hydroxyl radicals for chemodynamic therapy, and depleting GSH to amplify intratumoral oxidative stress. All these combined effects result in a significantly efficient tumor suppression outcome. This study enriches sonosensitizer research and proves that sonosensitizers can be rationally optimized by charge separation engineering strategy.

Furthermore, such nanoplatforms are capable of reshaping tumor microenvironments to realize ROS overproduction, contributed by overcoming tumor hypoxia to improve SDT-triggered singlet oxygen production, catalyzing endogenic hydrogen peroxide into destructive hydroxyl radicals for chemodynamic therapy, and depleting GSH to amplify intratumoral oxidative stress. All these combined effects result in a significantly efficient tumor suppression outcome. This study enriches sonosensitizer research and proves that sonosensitizers can be rationally optimized by charge separation engineering strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Magneto&#8208;Heated Ferrimagnetic Sponge for Continuous Recovery of Viscous Crude Oil</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ferrimagnetic sponge with the skeletons coated with poly(dimethylsiloxane) and iron oxide nanoparticles is developed to achieve continuous recovery of viscous crude oil. Under the exposure of an alternating magnetic field, the viscosity of the viscous oil around the sponge decreases sharply, thus accelerating its absorption.








Abstract
The high viscosity and low fluidity of heavy crude oil hinder its sorption by conventional porous sorbents, so the efficient clean&#8208;up of such heavy crude oil spills is challenging. Recently, Joule heating has been emerging as a new tool to reduce the viscosity of heavy crude oil dramatically. However, this direct&#8208;contact heating approach presents a potential risk due to the high voltage applied. To develop a non&#8208;contact recovery of viscous crude oil, here, a new approach for the fabrication of a series of ferrimagnetic sponges (FMSs) with hydrophobic porous channels is reported, whose surface can be remotely heated to 120 &#176;C within 10 s under an alternating magnetic field (f&#160;= 274&#160;kHz, H&#160;= 30 kA m&#8722;1). Compared with the solar&#8208;driven superficial heating, the integral magnetic heating in FMSs can result in a higher internal temperature of the sponges because of the confinement of thermal transport in the porous channels, which contributes to a dramatic decrease in oil viscosity and a significant increase in oil flow into the pores of FMSs. Furthermore, FMSs assembled with a self&#8208;priming pump can achieve continuous recovery of viscous crude oil (33.05&#160;g h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2) via remotely magnetic heating.

         <title>An Ultra&#8208;Low&#8208;Temperature Elastomer with Excellent Mechanical Performance and Solvent Resistance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of perfluoropolyether (PFPE)&#8208;based elastomers crosslinked by dynamic urethane are reported, which exhibit excellent elasticity at temperature down to &#8722;110 &#176;C&#160;and outstanding ductility within the cryogenic temperature range. Moreover, the high proportion of fluorocarbon segments also provides wonderful compatibility to most organic solvents, accounting for the low&#8208;swelling characteristics of the elastomer in low&#8208;temperature sealing applications.








Abstract
Elastomers presenting good elasticity, ductility, and chemical resistance at low temperatures can serve as superior performers for explorations in extremely cold environments. However, no commercially available elastomer to date can comprehensively fulfill those demands. Here, a perfluoropolyether (PFPE)&#8208;based network crosslinked by dynamic urethane chemistry is demonstrated, which may satisfy the demands of application in ultracold environments. As the crucial constitute in such a crosslinked network, PFPE provides the elastomer with excellent elasticity at a temperature down to &#8722;110 &#176;C&#160;and outstanding ductility within the cryogenic temperature range. Importantly, the high proportion of fluorocarbon segment also provides wonderful compatibility to most organic solvents, accounting for the low&#8208;swelling characteristics of the elastomer in sealing applications. Furthermore, the dynamic crosslinking feature allows the cured elastomer to be reprocessed like thermoplastic polymers, which affords great promise to recycle and reuse the elastomer after its disposal. Inherently, this elastomer would inspire a worldwide interest in the design of elastic devices that are adaptable to extremely low temperature.

         <title>Highly Luminescent Metal&#8208;Free Perovskite Single Crystal for Biocompatible X&#8208;Ray Detector to Attain Highest Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A large metal&#8208;free perovskite MDABCO&#8208;NH4I3 single crystal is grown. The crystal exhibits triplet self&#8208;trapping excitons recombination, a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 53%, and structure&#8208;modulated band nature and luminescence under high pressure. Finally, high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray response and imaging are demonstrated with sensitivity up to 1997 &#177; 80 &#956;C Gy cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed metal&#8208;based halide perovskites have taken a dominant position for perovskite optoelectronics including light emission and X&#8208;ray detection; however, the toxicity of the included heavy metals severely restricts their applications for wearable, lightweight, and transient optoelectronic devices. Here, the authors describe investigations of large (4 &#215; 6 &#215; 2 mm3) 3D metal&#8208;free perovskite MDABCO&#8208;NH4I3 (MDBACO = methyl&#8208;N&#8242;&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octonium) single crystal and its charge recombination and extraction behavior for light emission and X&#8208;ray detection. Unlike conventional 3D metal&#8208;based perovskites, this lightweight and biocompatible perovskite large crystal is processed from aqueous solution at room temperature, and can achieve both an extremely long carrier lifetime up to &#8776;1.03 &#181;s and the formation of self&#8208;trapped excited states for luminescence. These features contribute to a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) as high as &#8776;53% at room temperature and an X&#8208;ray sensitivity up to 1997 &#177; 80 &#956;C Gy&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 50&#160;V bias (highest among all metal&#8208;free detectors). The ability to tune the perovskite band gap by modulating the structure under high pressure is also demonstrated, which opens up applications for the crystal as colored emitters. These attributes make it a molecular alternative to metal&#8208;based perovskites for biocompatible and transient optoelectronics.

         <title>Elucidating the Mechanism of Fast Na Storage Kinetics in Ether Electrolytes for Hard Carbon Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A monodispersed nanospherules hard carbon anode is successfully synthesized, showing excellent electrochemical performance when matched with an ether&#8208;based electrolyte in sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The unique solvated Na+ and Na+ co&#8208;intercalation mechanism and the formed thin solid electrolyte interphase film with low interface impedance in ether&#8208;based electrolytes can significantly accelerate Na storage kinetics for hard carbon anodes.








Abstract
The sodium storage performance of a hard carbon (HC) anode in ether electrolytes exhibits a higher initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) and better rate performance compared to conventional ester electrolytes. However, the mechanism behind faster Na storage kinetics for HC in ether electrolytes remains unclear. Herein, a unique solvated Na+ and Na+ co&#8208;intercalation mechanism in ether electrolytes is reported using designed monodispersed HC nanospheres. In addition, a thin solid electrolyte interphase film with a high inorganic proportion formed in an ether electrolyte is visualized by cryo transmission electron microscopy and depth&#8208;profiling X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, which facilitates Na+ transportation, and results in a high ICE. Furthermore, the fast solvated Na+ diffusion kinetics in ether electrolytes are also revealed via molecular dynamics simulation. Owing to the contribution of the ether electrolytes, an excellent rate performance (214&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 10 A g&#8722;1 with an ultrahigh plateau capacity of 120 mAh g&#8722;1) and a high ICE (84.93% at 1 A g&#8722;1) are observed in a half cell; in a full cell, an attractive specific capacity of 110.3 mAh g&#8722;1 is achieved after 1000 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1.

         <title>A Soft and Absorbable Temporary Epicardial Pacing Wire</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A soft and absorbable temporary epicardial pacing wire (TPW), made of materials approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration [poly(l&#8208;lactide&#8208;co&#8208;&#949;&#8208;caprolactone)] and liquid metal (EGaIn), can pace the heart to recover from abnormal heartbeats after surgery and reduce the severe complications from the rigid and nonabsorbable TPWs.








Abstract
Existing temporary epicardial pacing wires (TPWs) are rigid and non&#8208;absorbable, such that they can cause severe complications after cardiac surgery. Here, a soft and absorbable temporary epicardial pacing wire (saTPW) for effectively correcting abnormal heart rates in a rabbit model, such as bradycardia and ventricular premature beat, is developed. The saTPW exhibits excellent conductivity, flexibility, cycling stability (&gt;100&#160;000 cycles), and less inflammatory response during two&#8208;month subcutaneous implantation in a rat model. The saTPW which consists of poly(l&#8208;lactide&#8208;co&#8208;&#949;&#8208;caprolactone) and liquid metal, can degrade about 13% (mass loss) in the rats over a two&#8208;month subcutaneous implantation. It can be absorbed over time in the body. The cytocompatibility and absorbability avoid secondary injuries caused by remaining wires which are permanently left in the body. The saTPW will provide a great platform for diagnosis and treatments in cardiovascular diseases by delivering the physiological signal and applying electrical stimulation for therapy.

         <title>Second Near&#8208;Infrared Light&#8208;Activatable Polymeric Nanoantagonist for Photothermal Immunometabolic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoactivatable semiconducting polymeric nanoantagonist (ASPA) is presented, whose photothermal and immunomodulation activities are controlled by second near&#8208;infrared light. Such a design can not only elicit tumor ablation and immunogenic cell death, but also initiate immunometabolic reprogramming on the adenosinergic pathway, thereby fostering tumoricidal cytotoxic T cells yet counteracting the immunosuppressive Treg cells in tumor.








Abstract
Immunometabolic modulation offers new opportunities to treat cancers as it is highly associated with cancer progression and immunosuppressive microenvironment. However, traditional regimens using nonselective small&#8208;molecule immunomodulators lead to the off&#8208;target adverse effects and insufficient therapeutic outcomes. Herein a second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) photothermally activatable semiconducting polymeric nanoantagonist (ASPA) for synergistic photothermal immunometabolic therapy of cancer is reported. ASPA backbone is obtained by conjugating vipadenant, an antagonist to adenosine A2A receptor, onto NIR&#8208;II light&#8208;absorbing semiconducting polymer via an azo&#8208;based thermolabile linker. Under deep&#8208;penetrating NIR&#8208;II photoirradiation, ASPA induces tumor thermal ablation and subsequently immunogenic cell death, triggers the cleavage of thermolabile linker, and releases the antagonist to block the immunosuppressive adenosinergic pathway. Such a remotely controlled immunometabolic regulation potentiates cytotoxic T cell functions while suppresses regulatory T cell activities, leading to efficient primary tumor inhibition, pulmonary metastasis prevention, and long&#8208;term immunological memory. Thereby, this work provides a generic polymeric approach for precise spatiotemporal regulation of cancer immunometabolism.

         <title>Dynamic Bifunctional Metasurfaces for Holography and Color Display</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic bifunctional metasurface for color nanoprinting and metaholograms is numerically and experimentally realized. Metaholograms are multiplexed with structural colors by controlling the spectral and phase response of the metasurface. The light diffraction can be switched between the &#8220;ON&#8221; and &#8220;OFF&#8221; states, or remain unchanged for different wavelength with the infiltration of the dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solution, making the colorful holographic images dynamically switchable.








Abstract
Metasurfaces have shown their unprecedented ability in wavefront shaping and triggered various applications with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performances, e.g., color nanoprinting and metaholograms. Recently, these two functions have been combined into a single metasurface to further expand its capabilities. Despite the progress, the current dual&#8208;mode metasurfaces are mostly static and strongly hinder their practical applications. Herein, the realization of dynamic bifunctional metasurfaces is reported. Five metaholograms at two different wavelengths are multiplexed with structural colors by controlling the spectral and phase response of metasurface. Owing to the destructive interference and the resonance on external environment, the light diffraction at particular wavelengths can be switched between &#8220;ON&#8221; and &#8220;OFF&#8221; states, or remain unchanged with the change of surrounding refractive index. Consequently, the encoded metaholograms are selectively turned on and off, making the overall holographic image dynamically switchable. This concept paves a solid step toward practical applications of all&#8208;dielectric metasurfaces.

         <title>Precipitation Hardening in Ferroelectric Ceramics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel ferroelectric hardening method is proposed by precipitating a secondary phase inside of the ferroelectric grains. Akin to hindered dislocation motion in metals, domain wall motion in ferroelectrics is impeded and loss is reduced. The mechanical quality factor in the model system BaTiO3&#8211;CaTiO3 is enhanced by 1.5 times, while the piezoelectric coefficient and planar electromechanical coupling factor remain nearly unchanged.








Abstract
Domain wall motion in ferroics, similar to dislocation motion in metals, can be tuned by well&#8208;concepted microstructural elements. In demanding high&#8208;power applications of piezoelectric materials, the domain wall motion is considered as a lossy hysteretic mechanism that should be restricted. Current applications for so&#8208;called hard piezoelectrics are abundant and hinge on the use of an acceptor&#8208;doping scheme. However, this mechanism features severe limitations due to enhanced mobility of oxygen vacancies at moderate temperatures. By analogy with metal technology, the authors present here a new solution for electroceramics, where precipitates are utilized to pin domain walls and improve piezoelectric properties. Through a sequence of sintering, nucleation, and precipitate growth, intragranular precipitates leading to a fine domain structure are developed as shown by transmission electron microscopy, piezoresponse force microscopy, and phase&#8208;field simulation. This structure impedes the domain wall motion as elucidated by electromechanical characterization. As a result, the mechanical quality factor is increased by &#8776;50% and the hysteresis in electrostrain is suppressed considerably. This is even achieved with slightly increased piezoelectric coefficient and electromechanical coupling factor. This novel process can be smoothly implemented in industrial production processes and is accessible to simple laboratory experimentation for microstructure optimization and implementation in various ferroelectric systems.

         <title>Molecular Alignment of Homoleptic Iridium Phosphors in Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>

Dopant alignment in doped, vacuum&#8208;deposited films can be promoted by molecular asymmetry and/or asymmetry in the dopant's electrostatic surface potential.








Abstract
The orientation of facial (fac) tris&#8208;cyclometalated iridium complexes in doped films prepared by vacuum deposition is investigated by altering the physical shape and electronic asymmetry in the molecular structure. Angle&#8208;dependent photoluminescence spectroscopy and Fourier&#8208;plane imaging microscopy show that the orientation of roughly spherical fac&#8208;tris(2&#8208;phenylpyridyl)iridium (Ir(ppy)3) is isotropic, whereas complexes that are oblate spheroids, fac&#8208;tris(mesityl&#8208;2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole)iridium (Ir(mi)3) and fac&#8208;tris((3,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;[1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4&#8208;yl)&#8208;2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole)iridium (Ir(mip)3), have a net horizontal alignment of their transition dipole moments. Optical anisotropy factors of 0.26 and 0.15, respectively, are obtained from the latter complexes when doped into tris(4&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)phenyl)amine host thin films. The horizontal alignment is attributed to the favorable van der Waals interaction between the oblate Ir complexes and host material. Trifluoromethyl groups substituted on one polar face of the Ir(ppy)3 and Ir(mi)3 complexes introduce chemical asymmetries in the molecules at the expense of their oblate shapes. The anisotropy factors of films doped with these substituted derivatives are lower relative to the parent complexes, indicating that the fluorinated patches reinforce horizontal alignment during deposition. High efficiencies obtained from organic light emitting diodes prepared using the Ir dopants is attributed, in part, to improved outcoupling of electroluminescence brought about by molecular alignment.

&lt;p&gt;Dopant alignment in doped, vacuum-deposited films can be promoted by molecular asymmetry and/or asymmetry in the dopant's electrostatic surface potential.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The orientation of facial (&lt;i&gt;fac&lt;/i&gt;) tris-cyclometalated iridium complexes in doped films prepared by vacuum deposition is investigated by altering the physical shape and electronic asymmetry in the molecular structure. Angle-dependent photoluminescence spectroscopy and Fourier-plane imaging microscopy show that the orientation of roughly spherical &lt;i&gt;fac&lt;/i&gt;-tris(2-phenylpyridyl)iridium (Ir(ppy)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is isotropic, whereas complexes that are oblate spheroids, &lt;i&gt;fac&lt;/i&gt;-tris(mesityl-2-phenyl-1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-imidazole)iridium (Ir(mi)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;fac&lt;/i&gt;-tris((3,5-dimethyl-[1,1&#8242;-biphenyl]-4-yl)-2-phenyl-1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-imidazole)iridium (Ir(mip)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), have a net horizontal alignment of their transition dipole moments. Optical anisotropy factors of 0.26 and 0.15, respectively, are obtained from the latter complexes when doped into &lt;i&gt;tris&lt;/i&gt;(4-(9&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-carbazol-9-yl)phenyl)amine host thin films. The horizontal alignment is attributed to the favorable van der Waals interaction between the oblate Ir complexes and host material. Trifluoromethyl groups substituted on one polar face of the Ir(ppy)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and Ir(mi)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; complexes introduce chemical asymmetries in the molecules at the expense of their oblate shapes. The anisotropy factors of films doped with these substituted derivatives are lower relative to the parent complexes, indicating that the fluorinated patches reinforce horizontal alignment during deposition. High efficiencies obtained from organic light emitting diodes prepared using the Ir dopants is attributed, in part, to improved outcoupling of electroluminescence brought about by molecular alignment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hydrogel Ionic Diodes toward Harvesting Ultralow&#8208;Frequency Mechanical Energy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrogel ionic diode for ultralow&#8208;frequency mechanical&#8208;energy harvesting is designed based on a sandwiched structure of anion and cation ionomers in hydrogels embedded with carbon nanotubes and silver nanowire electrodes. The ionic diode exhibits power density, charge density, and harvested energy that outperform current energy&#8208;harvesting devices by several orders of magnitude at 0.01&#160;Hz.








Abstract
Energy harvesting from human motion is regarded as a promising protocol for powering portable electronics, biomedical devices, and smart objects of the Internet of things. However, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art mechanical&#8208;energy&#8208;harvesting devices generally operate at frequencies (&gt;10&#160;Hz) well beyond human activity frequencies. Here, a hydrogel ionic diode formed by the layered structures of anionic and cationic ionomers in hydrogels is presented. As confirmed by finite element analysis, the underlying mechanism of the hydrogel ionic diode involves the formation of the depletion region by mobile cations and anions and the subsequent increase of the built&#8208;in potential across the depletion region in response to mechanical pressure. Owing to the enhanced ionic rectification ratio by the embedded carbon nanotube and silver nanowire electrodes, the hydrogel ionic diode exhibits a power density of &#8776;5&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2 and a charge density of &#8776;4&#160;mC&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 0.01&#160;Hz, outperforming the current energy&#8208;harvesting devices by several orders of magnitude. The applications of the self&#8208;powered hydrogel ionic diode to tactile sensing, pressure imaging, and touchpads are demonstrated, with sensing limitation is as low as 0.01&#160;kPa. This work is expected to open up new opportunities for ionic&#8208;current&#8208;based ionotronics in electronics and energy devices.

         <title>Spin&#8211;Orbit Torque&#8208;Induced Domain Nucleation for Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dominant mode of field&#8208;free magnetization switching in L11&#8208;CuPt/CoPt bilayer is demonstrated to be domain nucleation. The stable intermediate states from domain nucleation grant excellent memristive plasticity, which allows the spintronic device to be used as an artificial sigmoidal neuron. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept live training is performed to recognize written digits, with a high recognition rate comparable to simulation.








Abstract
Neuromorphic computing has become an increasingly popular approach for artificial intelligence because it can perform cognitive tasks more efficiently than conventional computers. However, it remains challenging to develop dedicated hardware for artificial neural networks. Here, a simple bilayer spintronic device for hardware implementation of neuromorphic computing is demonstrated. In L11&#8208;CuPt/CoPt bilayer, current&#8208;inducted field&#8208;free magnetization switching by symmetry&#8208;dependent spin&#8211;orbit torques shows a unique domain nucleation&#8208;dominated magnetization reversal, which is not accessible in conventional bilayers. Gradual domain nucleation creates multiple intermediate magnetization states which form the basis of a sigmoidal neuron. Using the L11&#8208;CuPt/CoPt bilayer as a sigmoidal neuron, the training of a deep learning network to recognize written digits, with a high recognition rate (87.5%) comparable to simulation (87.8%) is further demonstrated. This work offers a new scheme of implementing artificial neural networks by magnetic domain nucleation.

         <title>Interfacial Embedding of Laser&#8208;Manufactured Fluorinated Gold Clusters Enabling Stable Perovskite Solar Cells with Efficiency Over 24%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrophobic p&#8208;type semiconducting additive, fluorinated&#8208;gold&#8208;clusters, is used as a bifunctional interfacial mediator to efficiently modulate the carrier dynamics of perovskite and restrain the perovskite from degradation by external environmental stimuli, which results in an n&#8211;i&#8211;p perovskite solar cell with a champion efficiency up to 24.02% and moisture stability over 10 000 h in relative humidity of 75%.








Abstract
Tackling the interfacial loss in emerged perovskite&#8208;based solar cells (PSCs) to address synchronously the carrier dynamics and the environmental stability, has been of fundamental and viable importance, while technological hurdles remain in not only creating such interfacial mediator, but the subsequent interfacial embedding in the active layer. This article reports a strategy of interfacial embedding of hydrophobic fluorinated&#8208;gold&#8208;clusters (FGCs) for highly efficient and stable PSCs. The p&#8208;type semiconducting feature enables the FGC efficient interfacial mediator to improve the carrier dynamics by reducing the interfacial carrier transfer barrier and boosting the charge extraction at grain boundaries. The hydrophobic tails of the gold clusters and the hydrogen bonding between fluorine groups and perovskite favor the enhancement of environmental stability. Benefiting from these merits, highly efficient formamidinium lead iodide PSCs (champion efficiency up to 24.02%) with enhanced phase stability under varied relative humidity (RH) from 40% to 95%, as well as highly efficient mixed&#8208;cation PSCs with moisture stability (RH of 75%) over 10 000 h are achieved. It is thus inspiring to advance the development of highly efficient and stable PSCs via interfacial embedding laser&#8208;generated additives for improved charge transfer/extraction and environmental stability.

         <title>Directional Magnetization Reversal Enables Ultrahigh Energy Density in Gradient Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A directional magnetization reversal is discovered by engineering Nd2Fe14B/&#945;&#8208;Fe gradient nanostructures, in contrast to the conventional random and nonuniform magnetization reversal in ferromagnetics. This directional magnetization reversal enables a rare combination of high saturation magnetization and high coercivity, thus leading to a record&#8208;high energy product of 26 MG Oe for isotropic permanent magnetic materials.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance ferromagnetic materials are essential for energy conversion and electronic devices. However, the random and nonuniform magnetization reversal in ferromagnetics limits their performance that can be achieved. Here, through both micromagnetism simulations and experiments, a directional magnetization reversal that initiates first from large grains toward smaller ones is discovered by engineering Nd2Fe14B/&#945;&#8208;Fe gradient nanostructures. Such directional magnetization reversal enables a rare combination of high magnetization and large coercivity, thus leading to a record&#8208;high energy density (26 MG Oe) for isotropic permanent magnetic materials, which is &#8776;50% higher than that of its gradient&#8208;free counterpart. The unusual magnetization reversal originates from an ordered arrangement of grain sizes in the gradient material, where the large grains have a lower reversal field than that of the smaller ones. These findings open up new opportunities for developing high&#8208;performance magnetic materials.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Chiral Light&#8208;Emitting Diode Based on Strained Monolayer Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A room&#8208;temperature electrically tunable chiral light&#8208;emitting diode is realized using strained monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides. The strain effects break the threefold rotational symmetry, which results in different amounts of spin recombination at the K/K&#8217; valleys, to generate chiral light emission driven by electric fields. The results provide a new pathway for practical chiral light sources based on monolayer semiconductors.








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature chiral light sources whose optical helicity can be electrically switched are one of the most important devices for future optical quantum information processing. The emerging valley degree of freedom in monolayer semiconductors allows generation of chiral luminescence via valley polarization. However, relevant valley&#8208;polarized light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) have only been achieved at low temperatures (typically below 80 K). Here, a room&#8208;temperature chiral LED with strained transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers is realized. Spatially resolved polarization spectroscopy reveals that strain effects are crucial to yielding robust valley&#8208;polarized electroluminescence. The broken threefold rotational symmetry of strained monolayers induce inequivalent valley drifts at the K/K&#8217; valleys, resulting in different amounts of spin recombination driven by electric fields. Based on this scenario, ideally strained conditions are designed for LEDs on flexible substrates, in which the helicity of room&#8208;temperature valley&#8208;polarized electroluminescence is electrically tuned. The results provide a new pathway for practical chiral light sources based on monolayer semiconductors.

         <title>Heterogeneous 2D/3D Tin&#8208;Halides Perovskite Solar Cells with Certified Conversion Efficiency Breaking 14%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and effective strategy is delivered to modulate the 2D/3D microstructure of tin&#8208;perovskite films by introduction of a 2D phase with the function of FPEABr, which induces high&#8208;orientation growth of 3D&#160;FASnI3 by embracing the 3D grains at their surfaces and boundaries. That leads to a breakthrough of device performance of 14.81% in power conversion efficiency, along with 14.03% certified.








Abstract
As the most promising lead&#8208;free one, tin&#8208;halides based perovskite solar cells still suffer from the severe bulk&#8208;defect due to the easy oxidation of tin from divalent to tetravalent. Here, a general and effective strategy is delivered to modulate the microstructure of 2D/3D heterogeneous tin&#8208;perovskite absorber films by substituting FAI with FPEABr in FASnI3. The introduction of 2D&#160;phase can induce highly oriented growth of 3D FASnI3 and it is revealed in the optimal 2D/3D film that 2D phase embraces 3D grains and locates at the surfaces and grain boundaries. The FPEA+ based 2D tin&#8208;perovskite capping layer can offer a reducing atmosphere for vulnerable 3D FASnI3 grains. The unique microstructure effectively suppresses the well&#8208;known oxidation from Sn2+ to Sn4+, as well as decreasing defect density, which leads to a remarkable enhanced device performance from 9.38% to 14.81% in conversion efficiency. The certified conversion efficiency of 14.03% announces a new record and moves a remarkable step from the last one (12.4%). Besides of this breakthrough, this work definitely paves a new way to fabricate high&#8208;quality tin&#8208;perovskite absorber film by constructing effective 2D/3D microstructures.

Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes
A room&#8208;temperature electrically tunable chiral light&#8208;emitting diode is realized by Jiang Pu, Taishi Takenobu, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2100601, using strained monolayer transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides. The strain effects break the three&#8208;fold rotational symmetry, which results in different amounts of spin recombination at the K/K' valleys to generate chiral light emission driven by electric fields. The results provide a new pathway for practical chiral light sources based on monolayer semiconductors.

Coatings
In article number 2102349, Yixin Zhang and co&#8208;workers report an amphiphilic coating for glass surfaces, on which small droplets of polar aprotic organic solvents can be deposited with an enhanced contact angle (small feature size) and inhibited motion (strong binding), permitting fully automated multiple rounds of combinatorial synthesis of small&#8208;molecule compounds and peptides. The amphiphilic coating can be switched to hydrophilic network for protein&#8208; and cell&#8208;based screening.

Environmental Remediation
In article number 2100074, Yang Lu, Shu&#8208;Hong Yu, and co&#8208;workers report ferrimagnetic sponges for continuous recovery of viscous crude oil under the exposure of alternating magnetic field. The viscosity of crude oil around the magneto&#8208;heated sponge decreases sharply, thus accelerating the absorption into the sponge and achieving continuous recovery.

Quasicrystals
In article number 2102507, Kaoru Kimura, Ryo Yoshida, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate that machine&#8208;learning algorithms can predict the chemical composition of new quasicrystals. Furthermore, analyzing the input&#8211;output relationships black&#8208;boxed into the machine&#8208;learning model, they successfully identify nontrivial empirical equations interpretable by humans that describe the conditions necessary for stable quasicrystal formation. This is the first step toward understanding the formation mechanism of quasicrystals, which has been long sought in quasicrystal research.

In article number 2102624, Songwan Jin and co&#8208;workers generate liver spheroids that resemble the in vivo structure of the lobules. The structural integrity is maintained for several days, engendering an increased performance of cellular function. This is achieved thanks to the combination of two cutting edge technologies: preset&#8208;extrusion 3D bioprinting and microfluidics. Moreover, structured microtissues once injected into animals show a better engraftment, bringing to light the importance of phenotypically relevant models not only for drug screening but also regenerative medicine.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Cathode Materials for Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries: Structural Design and Electrochemical Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) are now receiving increasing research attention due to their obvious advantage regarding the potassium reserves. Cathode materials, which determine the energy density of PIBs, usually suffer from serious structural deformation during continuous K+ (de)intercalation. Therefore, proper structural&#8208;design principles of cathode materials should be focused on to ensure high performance to promote the further development of PIBs.








Abstract
Due to the obvious advantage in potassium reserves, potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) are now receiving increasing research attention as an alternative energy storage system for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Unfortunately, the large size of K+ makes it a challenging task to identify suitable electrode materials, particularly cathode ones that determine the energy density of PIBs, capable of tolerating the serious structural deformation during the continuous intercalation/deintercalation of K+. It is therefore of paramount importance that proper design principles of cathode materials be followed to ensure stable electrochemical performance if a practical application of PIBs is expected. Herein, the current knowledge on the structural engineering of cathode materials acquired during the battle against its performance degradation is summarized. The K+ storage behavior of different types of cathodes is discussed in detail and the structure&#8211;performance relationship of materials sensitive to their different lattice frameworks is highlighted. The key issues facing the future development of different categories of cathode materials are also highlighted and perspectives for potential approaches and strategies to promote the further development of PIBs are provided.

         <dc:description>
As an extension of single&#8208;atom catalysts, dual&#8208;atomic&#8208;site catalysts (DASCs) with high metal loading, sophisticated and flexible active sites have aroused great interest. The recent development of DASCs in characterization, synthetic methods, and catalytic applications are reviewed.








Abstract
Atomically dispersed metal catalysts with well&#8208;defined structures have been the research hotspot in heterogeneous catalysis because of their high atomic utilization efficiency, outstanding activity, and selectivity. Dual&#8208;atomic&#8208;site catalysts (DASCs), as an extension of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), have recently drawn surging attention. The DASCs possess higher metal loading, more sophisticated and flexible active sites, offering more chance for achieving better catalytic performance, compared with SACs. In this review, recent advances on how to design new DASCs for enhancing energy catalysis will be highlighted. It will start with the classification of marriage of two kinds of single&#8208;atom active sites, homonuclear DASCs and heteronuclear DASCs according to the configuration of active sites. Then, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art characterization techniques for DASCs will be discussed. Different synthetic methods and catalytic applications of the DASCs in various reactions, including oxygen reduction reaction, carbon dioxide reduction reaction, carbon monoxide oxidation reaction, and others will be followed. Finally, the major challenges and perspectives of DASCs will be provided.

         <title>Pushing the Limits of Flexibility and Stretchability of Solar Cells: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible and stretchable solar cells are important for a range of emerging applications such as electronic skins, e&#8208;textiles, wearable displays and health sensors, among others. An overview of stretchable optoelectronics is provided, where the benefits of stretchable solar cells are addressed, and the progress made in this field in terms of efficiency and strategies to achieve mechanical stretchability are underlined.








Abstract
Emerging forms of soft, flexible, and stretchable electronics promise to revolutionize the electronics industries of the future offering radically new products that combine multiple functionalities, including power generation, with arbitrary form factor. For example, skin&#8208;like electronics promise to transform the human&#8208;machine&#8208;interface, but the softness of the skin is incompatible with traditional electronic components. To address this issue, new strategies toward soft and wearable electronic systems are currently being pursued, which also include stretchable photovoltaics as self&#8208;powering systems for use in autonomous and stretchable electronics of the future. Here recent developments in the field of stretchable photovoltaics are reviewed and their potential for various emerging applications are examined. Emphasis is placed on the different strategies to induce stretchability including extrinsic and intrinsic approaches. In the former case, engineering and patterning of the materials and devices are key elements while intrinsically stretchable systems rely on mechanically compliant materials such as elastomers and organic conjugated polymers. The result is a review article that provides a comprehensive summary of the progress to date in the field of stretchable solar cells from the nanoscale to macroscopic functional devices. The article is concluded by discussing the emerging trends and future developments.

         <title>A Meta&#8208;Analysis of Conductive and Strong Carbon Nanotube Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A meta&#8208;analysis of 1304 data points collated over 266 papers statistically evaluates the relationships between carbon nanotube (CNT) material characteristics, at an extrinsic and intrinsic level, and compares them to graphitic intercalation compounds and conductive polymers. An unrivaled deep dive into the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art, it provides a roadmap to developing advanced CNT conductors simultaneously competitive with copper and carbon fiber.








Abstract
A study of 1304 data points collated over 266 papers statistically evaluates the relationships between carbon nanotube (CNT) material characteristics, including: electrical, mechanical, and thermal properties; ampacity; density; purity; microstructure alignment; molecular dimensions and graphitic perfection; and doping. Compared to conductive polymers and graphitic intercalation compounds, which have exceeded the electrical conductivity of copper, CNT materials are currently one&#8208;sixth of copper's conductivity, mechanically on&#8208;par with synthetic or carbon fibers, and exceed all the other materials in terms of a multifunctional metric. Doped, aligned few&#8208;wall CNTs (FWCNTs) are the most superior CNT category; from this, the acid&#8208;spun fiber subset are the most conductive, and the subset of fibers directly spun from floating catalyst chemical vapor deposition are strongest on a weight basis. The thermal conductivity of multiwall CNT material rivals that of FWCNT materials. Ampacity follows a diameter&#8208;dependent power&#8208;law from nanometer to millimeter scales. Undoped, aligned FWCNT material reaches the intrinsic conductivity of CNT bundles and single&#8208;crystal graphite, illustrating an intrinsic limit requiring doping for copper&#8208;level conductivities. Comparing an assembly of CNTs (forming mesoscopic bundles, then macroscopic material) to an assembly of graphene (forming single&#8208;crystal graphite crystallites, then carbon fiber), the &#8776;1 &#181;m room&#8208;temperature, phonon&#8208;limited mean&#8208;free&#8208;path shared between graphene, metallic CNTs, and activated semiconducting CNTs is highlighted, deemphasizing all metallic helicities for CNT power transmission applications.

         <title>First&#8208;Principles Multiscale Modeling of Mechanical Properties in Graphene/Borophene Heterostructures Empowered by Machine&#8208;Learning Interatomic Potentials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust concept of first&#8208;principles multiscale modeling of mechanical properties based on machine&#8208;learning interatomic potentials conveniently trainable over short ab initio datasets is proposed. It is shown that mechanical/failure responses of complex nanostructures at continuum scale and high temperatures can be explored with the precision of sophisticated first&#8208;principles calculations, affordable computational cost, and without the need for empirical data.








Abstract
Density functional theory calculations are robust tools to explore the mechanical properties of pristine structures at their ground state but become exceedingly expensive for large systems at finite temperatures. Classical molecular dynamics (CMD) simulations offer the possibility to study larger systems at elevated temperatures, but they require accurate interatomic potentials. Herein the authors propose the concept of first&#8208;principles multiscale modeling of mechanical properties, where ab initio level of accuracy is hierarchically bridged to explore the mechanical/failure response of macroscopic systems. It is demonstrated that machine&#8208;learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) fitted to ab initio datasets play a pivotal role in achieving this goal. To practically illustrate this novel possibility, the mechanical/failure response of graphene/borophene coplanar heterostructures is examined. It is shown that MLIPs conveniently outperform popular CMD models for graphene and borophene and they can evaluate the mechanical properties of pristine and heterostructure phases at room temperature. Based on the information provided by the MLIP&#8208;based CMD, continuum models of heterostructures using the finite element method can be constructed. The study highlights that MLIPs were&#160;the missing block for conducting first&#8208;principles multiscale modeling, and their employment empowers a straightforward route to bridge ab initio level accuracy and flexibility to explore the mechanical/failure response of nanostructures at continuum scale.

         <title>2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Perovskite with Ordered Phase Distribution for High&#8208;Performance Self&#8208;Powered Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance self&#8208;powered photodetector based on a 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskite with an ordered phase distribution is presented. The increased built&#8208;in potential due to the gradient phase distribution, oriented crystals, and improved crystal quality jointly contribute to the high photoresponse of the device in the entire response spectrum range.








Abstract
2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskites exhibit great potential in optoelectronic devices for superior stability compared with their 3D counterparts. However, to achieve a high level of device performance, it is crucial but challenging to regulate the phase distribution of 2D perovskites to facilitate charge carrier transfer. Herein, using a solvent additive method (adding a small amount of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF)) combined with a hot&#8208;casting process, the phase distribution of (PEA)2MA3Pb4I13 (PEA+&#160;= C6H5CH2CH2NH3+, MA+&#160;= CH3NH3+) perovskite can be well controlled and the Fermi level of perovskites along the film thickness direction can achieve gradient distribution. The increased built&#8208;in potential, oriented crystal, and improved crystal quality jointly contribute to the high photoresponse of devices in the entire response spectrum range. The optimum device exhibits a characteristic detection peak at 570&#160;nm with large responsivity/detectivity (0.44 A W&#8722;1/3.38 &#215; 1012 Jones), ultrafast response speed with a rise/fall time of 20.8/20.6 &#181;s, and improved stability. This work suggests the possibility of manipulating the ordered phase distribution of 2D perovskites toward high&#8208;performance and stable optoelectronic conversion devices.

&lt;p&gt;2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskites exhibit great potential in optoelectronic devices for superior stability compared with their 3D counterparts. However, to achieve a high level of device performance, it is crucial but challenging to regulate the phase distribution of 2D perovskites to facilitate charge carrier transfer. Herein, using a solvent additive method (adding a small amount of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-dimethylformamide (DMF)) combined with a hot-casting process, the phase distribution of (PEA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;MA&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Pb&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; (PEA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;= C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, MA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;= CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) perovskite can be well controlled and the Fermi level of perovskites along the film thickness direction can achieve gradient distribution. The increased built-in potential, oriented crystal, and improved crystal quality jointly contribute to the high photoresponse of devices in the entire response spectrum range. The optimum device exhibits a characteristic detection peak at 570&#160;nm with large responsivity/detectivity (0.44 A W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;/3.38 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; Jones), ultrafast response speed with a rise/fall time of 20.8/20.6 &#181;s, and improved stability. This work suggests the possibility of manipulating the ordered phase distribution of 2D perovskites toward high-performance and stable optoelectronic conversion devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Monolithic Tandem Multicolor Image Sensor Based on Electrochromic Color&#8208;Radix Demultiplexing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new design of a broadband color&#8208;tunable photodetector and its high&#8208;accuracy digital color&#8208;discrimination scheme is presented. Vertically stacked p&#8208;type and n&#8208;type graphene barristors demonstrates a superior capability of regulating charge transport under any desired illumination wavelengths, yielding voltage&#8208;controlled photoconductive gain spectra. An array of optoelectronic logic sensors that can demultiplex color coordinates with high color accuracy is demonstrated.








Abstract
Optical data acquisition has been set as one of the milestones to testify the developments aimed at harnessing the full potential of the spatial and temporal data processing capabilities of the advanced semiconductor technology. A highly promising approach to drive the level of acquisition beyond the current technological node is the vertical integration of multiple photodetectors. However, vertical integration so far requires the same level of circuit complexity as lateral integration from the incapability of monolithic integration. Here, an electrochromic device architecture is introduced that enables realization of a monolithic tandem multicolor photodetector. The device, composed of vertically stacked p&#8208;type and n&#8208;type graphene barristors, is demonstrated to be capable of regulating the balanced charge transport under any desired illumination wavelengths. It exhibits variable anti&#8208;ambipolar charge transport behavior, which yields sensitive voltage&#8208;controlled photoconductive gain spectra. These electrical behaviors are utilized to fabricate an optoelectronic logic sensor that can demultiplex the desired color coordinate or wavelength in the constituent array with high color accuracy.

         <title>New Insights into the High&#8208;Performance Black Phosphorus Anode for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A well&#8208;designed black phosphorus&#8211;graphite&#8211;carbon nanotube composite (BP/G/CNTs) shows stable high&#8208;current cycling performance at 2 A g&#8722;1. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy study of this material reveals the precise reaction mechanism of BP and Li+ during cycling.








Abstract
Black phosphorus (BP) is a promising anode material in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) owing to its high electrical conductivity and capacity. However, the huge volume change of BP during cycling induces rapid capacity fading. In addition, the unclear electrochemical mechanism of BP hinders the development of rational designs and preparation of high&#8208;performance BP&#8208;based anodes. Here, a high&#8208;performance nanostructured BP&#8211;graphite&#8211;carbon nanotubes composite (BP/G/CNTs) synthesized using ball&#8208;milling method is reported. The BP/G/CNTs anode delivers a high initial capacity of 1375&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 0.15 A g&#8722;1 and maintains 1031.7&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 after 450 cycles. Excellent high&#8208;rate performance is demonstrated with a capacity of 508.1&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 after 3000 cycles at 2 A g&#8722;1. Moreover, for the first time, direct evidence is provided experimentally to present the electrochemical mechanism of BP anodes with three&#8208;step lithiation and delithiation using ex situ X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), ex situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), ex situ X&#8208;ray emission spectroscopy, operando XRD, and operando XAS, which reveal the formation of Li3P7, LiP, and Li3P. Furthermore, the study indicates an open&#8208;circuit relaxation effect of the electrode with ex situ and operando XAS analyses.

         <title>Highly Permeable DNA Supramolecular Hydrogel Promotes Neurogenesis and Functional Recovery after Completely Transected Spinal Cord Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA supramolecular hydrogel carrying neural stem cells (NSCs) is applied to repair spinal cord injury. A renascent neural network is formed at the lesion site via the proliferation and differentiation of NSCs. Due to the newly formed synapses at the lesion area, rats recover basic hindlimb function with detectable motor&#8208;evoked potentials.








Abstract
Regeneration after severe spinal cord injury cannot occur naturally in mammals. Transplanting stem cells to the injury site is a highly promising method, but it faces many challenges because it relies heavily on the microenvironment provided by both the lesion site and delivery material. Although mechanical properties, biocompatibility, and biodegradability of delivery materials have been extensively explored, their permeability has rarely been recognized. Here, a DNA hydrogel is designed with extremely high permeability to repair a 2 mm spinal cord gap in Sprague&#8211;Dawley rats. The rats recover basic hindlimb function with detectable motor&#8208;evoked potentials, and a renascent neural network is formed via the proliferation and differentiation of both implanted and endogenous stem cells. The signal at the lesion area is conveyed by, on average, 15 newly formed synapses. This hydrogel system offers great potential in clinical trials. Further, it should be easily adaptable to other tissue regeneration applications.

         <title>Surface Diffusion and Epitaxial Self&#8208;Planarization for Wafer&#8208;Scale Single&#8208;Grain Metal Chalcogenide Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wafer&#8208;scale growth of single&#8208;grain 2D metal chalcogenides remains a challenge in the commercialization of various electronic devices based on these materials. A generalized surface&#8208;diffusion&#8208;induced epitaxial self&#8208;planarization method to produce wafer&#8208;scale single&#8208;grain metal chalcogenide thin films is described. This process also enables the practical applications of single&#8208;grain metal chalcogenides without involving a transfer process.








Abstract
Although wafer&#8208;scale single&#8208;grain thin films of 2D metal chalcogenides (MCs) have been extensively sought after during the last decade, the grain size of the MC thin films is still limited in the sub&#8208;millimeter scale. A general strategy of synthesizing wafer&#8208;scale single&#8208;grain MC thin films by using commercial wafers (Si, Ge, GaAs) both as metal source and epitaxial collimator is presented. A new mechanism of single&#8208;grain thin&#8208;film formation, surface diffusion, and epitaxial self&#8208;planarization is proposed, where chalcogen elements migrate preferentially along substrate surface and the epitaxial crystal domains flow to form an atomically smooth thin film. Through synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and high&#8208;resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy, the formation of single&#8208;grain Si2Te3, GeTe, GeSe, and GaTe thin films on (111) Si, Ge, and (100) GaAs is verified. The Si2Te3 thin film is used to achieve transfer&#8208;free fabrication of a high&#8208;performance bipolar memristive electrical&#8208;switching device.

         <title>A Nearly Packaging&#8208;Free Design Paradigm for Light, Powerful, and Energy&#8208;Dense Primary Microbatteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Billions of internet&#8208;connected devices require microbattery power sources, but their operating times are severely limited by the poor scaling of battery energy density. This work presents a new design paradigm for primary microbatteries that drastically improves energy and power density by eliminating the majority of packaging and using thick and dense electrodes with controlled crystal orientation for fast transport.








Abstract
Billions of internet connected devices used for medicine, wearables, and robotics require microbattery power sources, but the conflicting scaling laws between electronics and energy storage have led to inadequate power sources that severely limit the performance of these physically small devices. Reported here is a new design paradigm for primary microbatteries that drastically improves energy and power density by eliminating the vast majority of the packaging and through the use of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density anode and cathode materials. These light (50&#8211;80&#160;mg) and small (20&#8211;40&#160;&#181;L) microbatteries are enabled though the electroplating of 130&#160;&#181;m&#8208;thick 94% dense additive&#8208;free and crystallographically oriented LiCoO2 onto thin metal foils, which also act as the encapsulation layer. These devices have 430&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and 1050&#160;Wh L&#8722;1 energy densities, 4 times the energy density of previous similarly sized microbatteries, opening up the potential to power otherwise unpowerable microdevices.

         <title>A Smartphone&#8208;Enabled Portable Digital Light Processing 3D Printer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A smartphone&#8208;enabled Digital Light Processing (DLP) 3D printer based on a smartphone&#8208;powered projector and a customized touchscreen smartphone app is developed, featuring portability, modularity, and an easy&#8208;to&#8208;use interface. The ability of printing with versatile materials covers commercial resins and several hydrogel&#8208;based (bio)inks. This platform is proven to be applicable to fabrication of medical implants, in situ bioprinting, and integration with a 3D object&#8208;scanning app.








Abstract
3D printing has emerged as an enabling approach in a variety of different fields. However, the bulk volume of printing systems limits the expansion of their applications. In this study, a portable 3D Digital Light Processing (DLP) printer is built based on a smartphone&#8208;powered projector and a custom&#8208;written smartphone&#8208;operated app. Constructs with detailed surface architectures, porous features, or hollow structures, as well as sophisticated tissue analogs, are successfully printed using this platform, by utilizing commercial resins as well as a range of hydrogel&#8208;based inks, including poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;diacrylate, gelatin methacryloyl, or allylated gelatin. Moreover, due to the portability of the unique DLP printer, medical implants can be fabricated for point&#8208;of&#8208;care usage, and cell&#8208;laden tissues can be produced in situ, achieving a new milestone for mobile&#8208;health technologies. Additionally, the all&#8208;in&#8208;one printing system described herein enables the integration of the 3D scanning smartphone app to obtain object&#8208;derived 3D digital models for subsequent printing. Along with further developments, this portable, modular, and easy&#8208;to&#8208;use smartphone&#8208;enabled DLP printer is anticipated to secure exciting opportunities for applications in resource&#8208;limited and point&#8208;of&#8208;care settings not only in biomedicine but also for home and educational purposes.

         <title>Avoiding the Center&#8208;Symmetry Trap: Programmed Assembly of Dipolar Precursors into Porous, Crystalline Molecular Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer growth is used to stack asymmetric, dipolar organic building units on inorganic substrates, permitting porous, crystalline molecular materials that lack inversion symmetry. This programmed assembly yields electric fields orientated normal to the substrate. This electrostatic design creates possibilities for band structure engineering and also results in nonlinear optical activity (second&#8208;harmonic generation).








Abstract
Liquid&#8208;phase, quasi&#8208;epitaxial growth is used to stack asymmetric, dipolar organic compounds on inorganic substrates, permitting porous, crystalline molecular materials that lack inversion symmetry. This allows material fabrication with built&#8208;in electric fields. A new programmed assembly strategy based on metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is described that facilitates crystalline, noncentrosymmetric space groups for achiral compounds. Electric fields are integrated into crystalline, porous thin films with an orientation normal to the substrate. Changes in electrostatic potential are detected via core&#8208;level shifts of marker atoms on the MOF thin films and agree with theoretical results. The integration of built&#8208;in electric fields into organic, crystalline, and porous materials creates possibilities for band structure engineering to control the alignment of electronic levels in organic molecules. Built&#8208;in electric fields may also be used to tune the transfer of charges from donors loaded via programmed assembly into MOF pores. Applications include organic electronics, photonics, and nonlinear optics, since the absence of inversion symmetry results in a clear second&#8208;harmonic generation signal.

         <title>Ordered Macroporous Carbonous Frameworks Implanted with CdS Quantum Dots for Efficient Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D ordered macroporous N&#8208;doped&#8208;carbon&#8208;supported CdS quantum dots are fabricated via an in situ transformation strategy. The as&#8208;prepared materials exhibit superior activity and selectivity in photocatalytic CO2 reduction coupled with amines oxidation, affording a CO production rate as high as 5210 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 under the irradiation of visible light in the absence of any sacrificial agents and alkaline additives.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven photocatalytic CO2 reduction is regarded as a promising way to simultaneously mitigate the energy crisis and CO2 pollution. However, achieving high efficiency of photocatalytic CO2 reduction, especially without the assistance of sacrifice reagents or extra alkaline additives, remains a critical issue. Herein, a photocatalyst of 3D ordered macroporous N&#8208;doped carbon (NC) supported CdS quantum dots (3DOM CdSQD/NC) is successfully fabricated toward photocatalytic CO2 reduction via an in situ transformation strategy. Additionally, an amines oxidation reaction is introduced to replace the H2O oxidation process to further boost the photocatalytic CO2 reduction efficiency. Impressively, 3DOM CdSQD/NC exhibits superior activity and selectivity in photocatalytic CO2 reduction coupled with amines oxidation, affording a CO production rate as high as 5210 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in the absence of any sacrificial agents and alkaline additives. Moreover, 3DOM CdSQD/NC achieves an apparent quantum efficiency of 2.9% at 450 nm. Mechanism studies indicate that the 3D ordered macropores in the NC matrix are beneficial to the transfer of photogenerated carriers. Furthermore, the highly dispersed CdS QDs on the NC skeleton are able to significantly promote the adsorption of both CO2 and amine molecules and depress the CO2 activation energy barriers by stabilizing the *COOH intermediate, directly contributing to the high activity.

Dielectric polymer nanocomposites with ultralow filler loadings exhibit considerably improved dielectric constant and breakdown strength, giving rise to remarkable discharged energy densities. A mathematical model is established to predict the dielectric constant of composites with low filler contents, revealing the significant contribution of the interphase to the polarization.








Abstract
Polymer dielectrics with excellent processability and high breakdown strength (Eb) enable the development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density capacitors. Although the improvement of dielectric constant (K) of polymer dielectric has been realized by adding high&#8208;K inorganic fillers with high contents (&gt;10 vol%), this approach faces significant challenges in scalable film processing. Here, the incorporation of ultralow ratios (&lt;1 vol%) of low&#8208;K Cd1&#8722;xZnxSe1&#8722;ySy nanodots into a ferroelectric polymer is reported. The polymer composites exhibit substantial and concurrent increase in both K and Eb, yielding a discharged energy density of 26.0 J cm&#8722;3, outperforming the current dielectric polymers and nanocomposites measured at &#8804;600 MV m&#8722;1. The observed unconventional dielectric enhancement is attributed to the structural changes induced by the nanodot fillers, including transformation of polymer chain conformation and induced interfacial dipoles, which have been confirmed by density function theory calculations. The dielectric model established in this work addresses the limitations of the current volume&#8208;average models on the polymer composites with low filler contents and gives excellent agreement to the experimental results. This work provides a new experimental route to scalable high&#8208;energy&#8208;density polymer dielectrics and also advances the fundamental understanding of the dielectric behavior of polymer nanocomposites at atomistic scales.

         <title>New Structure Mass Tag based on Zr&#8208;NMOF for Multiparameter and Sensitive Single&#8208;Cell Interrogating in Mass Cytometry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high specificity and sensitivity of a Zr mass tag in concert with the exploitation of four additional detection channels compatible with MCP_Abs indicates a great promise for developing nanoscale metal&#8211;organic&#8208;framework&#8208;based mass tags as next&#8208;generation molecular probes in CyTOF for multiparameter and sensitive single&#8208;cell biomarker interrogating.








Abstract
Mass cytometry, also called cytometry by time&#8208;of&#8208;flight (CyTOF), is an emerging powerful proteomic analysis technique that utilizes metal chelated polymer (MCP) as mass tags for interrogating high&#8208;dimensional biomarkers simultaneously on millions of individual cells. However, under the typical polymer&#8208;based mass tag system, the sensitivity and multiplexing detection ability has been highly restricted. Herein, a new structure mass tag based on a nanometal organic framework (NMOF) is reported for multiparameter and sensitive single&#8208;cell biomarker interrogating in CyTOF. A uniform&#8208;sized Zr&#8208;NMOF (33 nm)&#160;carrying 105 metal ions is synthesized under modulator/reaction time coregulation, which is monodispersed and colloidally stable in water for over one&#8208;year storage. On functionalization with an antibody, the Zr mass tag exhibits specific molecular recognition properties and minimal cross&#8208;reaction toward nontargeted cells. In addition, the Zr&#8208;mass tag is compatible with MCP mass tags in a multiparameter assay for mouse spleen cells staining, which exploits four additional channels, m/z&#160;= 90, 91, 92, 94, for single&#8208;cell immunoassays in CyTOF. Compared to the MCP mass tag, the Zr&#8208;mass tag provides an additional fivefold signal amplification. This work provides the fundamental technical capability for exploiting NMOF&#8208;based mass tags for CyTOF application, which opens up possibility of high&#8208;dimensional single&#8208;cell immune profiling, low abundant antigen detection, and development of new barcoding systems.

         <title>Accelerating Ion Dynamics Under Cryogenic Conditions by the Amorphization of Crystalline Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amorphization is an effective strategy to promote low&#8208;temperature dynamics of cathodes by promoting fast charge transfer at the electrolyte&#8211;electrode interface and relieving the blocking effect of dense lattice structure on ion transport under cryogenic conditions. The synthesized amorphous organic electrode exhibits an unprecedented specific capacity of 141 mAh g&#8722;1 at an ultralow temperature of &#8722;80&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
The normal operation of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) at ultralow temperature (&lt;&#8722;40&#160;&#176;C) is significant for cold&#8208;climate applications; however, their operation is plagued by the low capacity of the conventional intercalation cathodes due to their sluggish kinetics and the slow solid diffusion of Li+ in their frameworks. Here, it is demonstrated that amorphization is an effective strategy to promote the low&#8208;temperature dynamics of cathodes by relieving the blocking effect of a dense lattice structure on ion transport under cryogenic conditions. As a result, due to the decreased charge transport impedance and enhanced Li+ diffusion rate, the obtained covalent amorphous polymer (CAP) with an abundance of pyrazine and carbonyl active sites displays a remarkably outstanding specific capacity of 141 mAh g&#8722;1 at &#8722;80&#160;&#176;C, which is superior to its structural analog, a covalent crystalline polymer (43.8 mAh g&#8722;1). Furthermore, 84.7% of the initial capacity of the CAP can be retained after 500 cycles of charge and discharge at &#8722;60&#160;&#176;C. Molecular dynamic simulations show that the channel&#8208;rich amorphous structure is highly conducive for lithium ions to diffuse quickly in the interstitial space of organic solids. This work provides an effective strategy regarding the amorphization of crystalline cathodes to develop low&#8208;temperature (Low&#8208;T) batteries.

         <title>Rapid Capture of Cancer Extracellular Vesicles by Lipid Patch Microarrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extracellular vesicles have great prospects as diagnostic and therapeutic tools. However, their isolation still poses challenges. A novel supported lipid&#8208;membrane&#8208;based platform is introduced for rapid capture, with high specificity and sensitivity, only a small needed analyte volume, and without additional purification steps. The platform is flexible and can be applied to many targets by corresponding antibodies.








Abstract
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) contain various bioactive molecules such as DNA, RNA, and proteins, and play a key role in the regulation of cancer progression. Furthermore, cancer&#8208;associated EVs carry specific biomarkers and can be used in liquid biopsy for cancer detection. However, it is still technically challenging and time consuming to detect or isolate cancer&#8208;associated EVs from complex biofluids (e.g., blood). Here, a novel EV&#8208;capture strategy based on dip&#8208;pen nanolithography generated microarrays of supported lipid membranes is presented. These arrays carry specific antibodies recognizing EV&#8208; and cancer&#8208;specific surface biomarkers, enabling highly selective and efficient capture. Importantly, it is shown that the nucleic acid cargo of captured EVs is retained on the lipid array, providing the potential for downstream analysis. Finally, the feasibility of EV capture from patient sera is demonstrated. The demonstrated platform offers rapid capture, high specificity, and sensitivity, with only a small need in analyte volume and without additional purification steps. The platform is applied in context of cancer&#8208;associated EVs, but it can easily be adapted to other diagnostic EV targets by use of corresponding antibodies.

         <title>Large&#8208;Area Vertically Aligned Bismuthene Nanosheet Arrays from Galvanic Replacement Reaction for Efficient Electrochemical CO2 Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large&#8208;area vertically aligned bismuthene nanosheet arrays are demonstrated to grow on various Cu substrates via the galvanic replacement reaction. They feature small nanosheet thickness, large surface areas, and abundant porosity between the nanosheets, and can enable efficient and robust CO2 reduction to formate in aqueous solution.








Abstract
There is a lack of straightforward methods to prepare high&#8208;quality bismuthene nanosheets, or, even more challengingly, to grow their arrays due to the low melting point and high oxophilicity of bismuth. This synthetic obstacle has hindered their potential applications. In this work, it is demonstrated that the galvanic replacement reaction can do the trick. Under well&#8208;controlled conditions, large&#8208;area vertically aligned bismuthene nanosheet arrays are grown on Cu substrates of various shapes and sizes. The product features small nanosheet thickness of two to three atomic layers, large surface areas, and abundant porosity between nanosheets. Most remarkably, bismuthene nanosheet arrays grown on Cu foam can enable efficient CO2 reduction to formate with high Faradaic efficiency of &gt;90%, large current density of 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, and great stability.

They feature small nanosheet thickness, large surface areas, and abundant porosity between the nanosheets, and can enable efficient and robust CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction to formate in aqueous solution.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lack of straightforward methods to prepare high-quality bismuthene nanosheets, or, even more challengingly, to grow their arrays due to the low melting point and high oxophilicity of bismuth. This synthetic obstacle has hindered their potential applications. In this work, it is demonstrated that the galvanic replacement reaction can do the trick. Under well-controlled conditions, large-area vertically aligned bismuthene nanosheet arrays are grown on Cu substrates of various shapes and sizes. The product features small nanosheet thickness of two to three atomic layers, large surface areas, and abundant porosity between nanosheets. Most remarkably, bismuthene nanosheet arrays grown on Cu foam can enable efficient CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction to formate with high Faradaic efficiency of &amp;gt;90%, large current density of 50&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and great stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Zero&#8208;Valent Palladium Single&#8208;Atoms Catalysts Confined in Black Phosphorus for Efficient Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zero&#8208;valent palladium single&#8208;atoms catalysts confined in black phosphorus are successfully synthesized via atomic layer deposition (ALD). This BP&#8208;based SAC with metallic Pd1/P shows a highly selective semi&#8208;hydrogenation of phenylacetylene toward styrene, opening up new avenues for designing zero&#8208;valent SACs on BP for a wide range of organic transformations.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) represent a new frontier in heterogeneous catalysis due to their remarkable catalytic properties and maximized atomic utilization. However, single atoms often bond to the support with polarized electron density and thus exhibit a high valence state, limiting their catalytic scopes in many chemical transformations. Here, it is demonstrated that 2D black phosphorus (BP) acts as giant phosphorus (P) ligand to confine a high density of single atoms (e.g., Pd1, Pt1) via atomic layer deposition. Unlike other 2D materials, BP with relatively low electronegativity and buckled structure favors the strong confinement of robust zero&#8208;valent palladium SACs in the vacancy site. Metallic Pd1/BP SAC shows a highly selective semi&#8208;hydrogenation of phenylacetylene toward styrene, distinct from metallic Pd nanoparticles that facilitate the formation of fully hydrogenated products. Density functional theory calculations reveal that Pd atom forms covalent&#8208;like bonding with adjacent P atoms, wherein H atoms tend to adsorb, aiding the dissociative adsorption of H2. Zero&#8208;valent Pd in the confined space favors a larger energy gain for the synthesis of partially hydrogenated product over the fully hydrogenated one. This work provides a new route toward the synthesis of zero&#8208;valent SACs on BP for organic transformations.

         <title>Triarylamine&#8208;Pyridine&#8208;Carbonitriles for Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Devices with EQE Nearly 40%</title>

         <dc:description>
Three 2,6&#8208;diphenylpyridine&#8208;3,5&#8208;dicarbonitrile&#8208;based compounds with excellent photoluminescent quantum yields (79&#8211;100%) and high horizontal dipole ratios (86&#8722;88%) in the thin films are demonstrated. With two methyl groups on the triarylamines, the spin&#8722;orbit coupling is enhanced due to the elevated locally excited triplet states (3LE), leading to a fast reverse intersystem crossing. Green thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on them exhibit a record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency of 39.8% without any optical extraction technique.








Abstract
Highly efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules are in urgent demand for solid&#8208;state lighting and full&#8208;color displays. Here, the design and synthesis of three triarylamine&#8208;pyridine&#8208;carbonitrile&#8208;based TADF compounds, TPAPPC, TPAmPPC, and tTPAmPPC, are shown. They exhibit excellent photoluminescence quantum yields of 79&#8722;100% with small &#916;EST values, fast reverse intersystem crossing (RISC), and high horizontal dipole ratios (&#920;//&#160;= 86&#8722;88%) in the thin films leading to the enhancement of device light outcoupling. Consequently, a green organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) based on TPAmPPC shows a high average external quantum efficiency of 38.8&#160;&#177; 0.6%, a current efficiency of 130.1&#160;&#177; 2.1&#160;cd A&#8211;1, and a power efficiency of 136.3&#160;&#177; 2.2&#160;lm W&#8211;1. The highest device efficiency of 39.8% appears to be record&#8208;breaking among TADF&#8208;based OLEDs to date. In addition, the TPAmPPC&#8208;based device shows superior operation lifetime and high&#8208;temperature resistance. It is worth noting that the TPA&#8208;PPC&#8208;based materials have excellent optical properties and the potential for making them strong candidates for TADF practical application.

         <title>A New Class of Chiral Nematic Phase with Helical Polar Order</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of chiral liquid&#8208;crystal phase, the polar cholesteric phase, is realized. In addition to the unique dielectric property succeeded from the polar nematic host, the polar cholesteric phase is distinct from the conventional cholesteric phase due to the non&#8208;degeneracy of the local nematic director, as observed in the fundamental optical behaviors in wedge&#8208;cells or under E&#8208;fields.








Abstract
A novel chiral nematic phase with a polar helical order is realized via the introduction of helical twisting power into a polar nematogen. The properties of the induced polar nematic (polar cholesteric: Np*) phase differ from those of the conventional cholesteric (N*) phases existing thus far. Np*, which is a new class of N* structures, is characterized not only by its helically twisted nematic director, but also by a continuously twisted polarization. Transmission spectroscopy and helical pitch measurements in a wedge cell revealed that the half&#8208;helical pitch in the Np* phase vanished because of the polar response in the Np* helix. The inner polar director in the Np* phase is confirmed in dielectric and second&#8208;harmonic&#8208;generation studies. Furthermore, this unique Np*LC, which corresponds to a half&#8208;/full&#8208;pitch helix, enables ultrafast electro&#8208;optic switching (&#964;&#160;&lt;&#160;20&#160;&#181;s), and proposes new potential applications for electrically interchangeable photonic bandgaps.

         <title>The Manufacture of Unbreakable Bionics via Multifunctional and Self&#8208;Healing Silk&#8211;Graphene Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>

Biomaterials that transmit electricity like the human body can open new opportunities. For seamless mirroring of our&#160;anatomy, they also need to conform to its curvilinear architecture, and display self&#8208;healing ability like native organs and tissues. To address this, a conductive, adhesive, reconfigurable, and viscoelastic gum (CareGum), with promising applications in cyborganics, bionics, and soft robotics, is developed.








Abstract
Biomaterials capable of transmitting signals over longer distances than those in rigid electronics can open new opportunities for humanity by mimicking the way tissues propagate information. For seamless mirroring of the human body, they also have to display conformability to its curvilinear architecture, as well as, reproducing native&#8208;like mechanical and electrical properties combined with the ability to self&#8208;heal on demand like native organs and tissues. Along these lines, a multifunctional composite is developed by mixing silk fibroin and reduced graphene oxide. The material is coined &#8220;CareGum&#8221; and capitalizes on a phenolic glue to facilitate sacrificial and hierarchical hydrogen bonds. The hierarchal bonding scheme gives rise to high mechanical toughness, record&#8208;breaking elongation capacity of &#8776;25 000%, excellent conformability to arbitrary and complex surfaces, 3D printability, a tenfold increase in electrical conductivity, and a fourfold increase in Young's modulus compared to its pristine counterpart. By taking advantage of these unique properties, a durable and self&#8208;healing bionic glove is developed for hand gesture sensing and sign translation. Indeed, CareGum is a new advanced material with promising applications in fields like cyborganics, bionics, soft robotics, human&#8211;machine interfaces, 3D&#8208;printed electronics, and flexible bioelectronics.

         <title>Chiral Helimagnetism and One&#8208;Dimensional Magnetic Solitons in a Cr&#8208;Intercalated Transition Metal Dichalcogenide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral helimagnetism and 1D magnetic solitons are discovered in Cr&#8208;intercalated 2H&#8208;TaS2. The chiral helimagnetic structure has an initial period of &#8776;25&#160;nm, and it transforms into a chiral soliton lattice in an external magnetic field. The spatial period evolution of this topological spin texture obeys the chiral sine&#8208;Gordon theory, revealing great potential for fast&#8208;speed racetrack memories.








Abstract
Chiral magnets endowed with topological spin textures are expected to have promising applications in next&#8208;generation magnetic memories. In contrast to the well&#8208;studied 2D or 3D magnetic skyrmions, the authors report the discovery of 1D nontrivial magnetic solitons in a transition metal dichalcogenide 2H&#8208;TaS2 via precise intercalation of Cr elements. In the synthetic Cr1/3TaS2 (CTS) single crystal, the coupling of the strong spin&#8211;orbit interaction from TaS2 and the chiral arrangement of the magnetic Cr ions evoke a robust Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction. A magnetic helix having a short spatial period of &#8776;25&#160;nm is observed in CTS via Lorentz transmission electron microscopy. In a magnetic field perpendicular to the helical axis, the helical spin structure transforms into a chiral soliton lattice (CSL) with the spin structure evolution being consistent with the chiral sine&#8208;Gordon theory, which opens promising perspectives for the application of CSL to fast&#8208;speed nonvolatile magnetic memories. This work introduces a new paradigm to soliton physics and provides an effective strategy for seeking novel 2D magnets.

         <title>Penta&#8208;PdPSe: A New 2D Pentagonal Material with Highly In&#8208;Plane Optical, Electronic, and Optoelectronic Anisotropy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new 2D pentagonal material, penta&#8208;PdPSe, with low&#8208;symmetry lattice characteristics, is introduced to the 2D family. Such a low&#8208;symmetry structure endows this material with strong in&#8208;plane anisotropy, in which high conductance and photoresponsivity anisotropic ratios of 4.74 and 6.17 are achieved, respectively. These results make 2D penta&#8208;PdPSe an ideal material for the design of next&#8208;generation anisotropic devices.








Abstract
Due to their low&#8208;symmetry lattice characteristics and intrinsic in&#8208;plane anisotropy, 2D pentagonal materials, a new class of 2D materials composed entirely of pentagonal atomic rings, are attracting increasing research attention. However, the existence of these 2D materials has not been proven experimentally until the recent discovery of PdSe2. Herein, penta&#8208;PdPSe, a new 2D pentagonal material with a novel low&#8208;symmetry puckered pentagonal structure, is introduced to the 2D family. Interestingly, a peculiar polyanion of [Se&#63743;P&#63743;P&#63743;Se]4&#8722; is discovered in this material, which is the biggest polyanion in 2D materials yet discovered. Strong intrinsic in&#8208;plane anisotropic behavior endows penta&#8208;PdPSe with highly anisotropic optical, electronic, and optoelectronic properties. Impressively, few&#8208;layer penta&#8208;PdPSe&#8208;based phototransistor not only achieves excellent electronic performances, a moderate electron mobility of 21.37 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and a high on/off ratio of up to 108, but it also has a high photoresponsivity of &#8776;5.07&#160;&#215; 103 A W&#8722;1 at 635&#160;nm, which is ascribed to the photogating effect. More importantly, penta&#8208;PdPSe also exhibits a large anisotropic conductance (&#963;max/&#963;max&#160;= 3.85) and responsivity (Rmax/Rmin&#160;= 6.17 at 808&#160;nm), superior to most 2D anisotropic materials. These findings make penta&#8208;PdPSe an ideal material for the design of next&#8208;generation anisotropic devices.

         <title>Mussel&#8208;Inspired Design of a Self&#8208;Adhesive Agent for Durable Moisture Management and Bacterial Inhibition on PET Fabric</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mussel&#8208;inspired hydrophilic agent based on the cation&#8211;&#960; interaction is developed with strong self&#8208;adhesion on poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) fabric to form a durable superhydrophilic and antibacterial coating. It shows great potential in designing a Janus PET fabric for efficient sweat/heat management and bacterial inhibition without interfering the balance of the skin microflora, which is highly valued in physiological health and long&#8208;term wearing.








Abstract
Functional textiles with advanced moisture management can enhance human comfort and physiological health. However, conventional wet finishing processes used for textiles are usually highly polluting and exhibit poor fastness. Inspired by the strong underwater adhesion properties of mussels based on cation&#8211;&#960; interaction, a novel superhydrophilic polymeric molecule with strong cohesion and adhesion property is designed on a poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) fabric. The cation&#8211;&#960; hydrophilic agent (CPHA) can efficiently transform the hydrophobic PET fabric to a superhydrophilic one, and its superhydrophilicity can withstand 150 home laundry cycles. In addition, the cationic moieties in the CPHA self&#8208;adhere to the PET fabric without any finishing auxiliary that would cause pollution. Due to its strong adhesion, CPHA can be applied to one side of the PET fabric via spray coating and curing to form a Janus hydrophobic/superhydrophilic fabric capable of diode&#8208;like one&#8208;way sweat transportation (with forward transportation capability of 1115% and backward transportation capability of &#8722;1509%). Moreover, the Janus fabric inhibits bacterial growth and invasion, while simultaneously preserving the inner ecological healthy balance of the skin's microflora. This work opens up a pathway to develop adhesives in textile wet processing for more diverse, smarter applications, e.g., quick&#8208;dry sportswear, protective suits, or air&#8208;conditioning fabrics.

         <title>Facile Production of Phosphorene Nanoribbons towards Application in Lithium Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphorene nanoribbons (PNRs) are prepared by a facile electrochemical exfoliation with a high yield of &gt;80%. The PNR film acts as a protective layer on a lithium&#8208;metal anode to form a Li+&#8208;ion&#8208;conducting Li3P interface that enables long&#8208;time cycling stability of lithium&#8208;metal batteries.








Abstract
Like phosphorene, phosphorene nanoribbon (PNR) promises exotic properties but unzipping phosphorene into edge&#8208;defined PNR is non&#8208;trivial because of uncontrolled cutting of phosphorene along random directions. Here a facile electrochemical strategy to fabricate zigzag&#8208;edged PNRs in high yield (&gt;80%) is reported. The presence of chemically active zigzag edges in PNR allows it to spontaneously react with Li to form a Li+ ion conducting Li3P phase, which can be used as a protective layer on Li metal anode in lithium metal batteries (LMBs). PNR protective layer prevents the parasitic reaction between lithium metal and electrolyte and promotes Li+ ion diffusion kinetics, enabling homogenous Li+ ion flux and long&#8208;time cycling stability up to 1100&#160;h at a current density of 1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. LiFePO4|PNR&#8208;Li full&#8208;cell batteries with an areal capacity of 2&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2, a lean electrolyte (20&#160;&#181;l&#160;mAh&#8722;1) and a negative/positive (N/P) electrodes ratio of 3.5 can be stably cycled over 100 cycles.

PNR protective layer prevents the parasitic reaction between lithium metal and electrolyte and promotes Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion diffusion kinetics, enabling homogenous Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion flux and long-time cycling stability up to 1100&#160;h at a current density of 1&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;|PNR-Li full-cell batteries with an areal capacity of 2&#160;mAh&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, a lean electrolyte (20&#160;&#181;l&#160;mAh&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and a negative/positive (N/P) electrodes ratio of 3.5 can be stably cycled over 100 cycles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Hydrogels for Rapid Water Disinfection and Sustainable Solar Vapor Generation</title>

         <dc:description>
Antibacterial hydrogels (ABHs) are designed as tablets for rapid water disinfection (&gt;99.999%) and can be easily removed from water without leaving chemical impurities. With excellent photothermal and biofouling&#8208;resistant properties, ABHs can also be functional in solar water&#8208;purification technologies to enable stable distillate production after months of storage and operation in bacteria&#8208;containing river water. 








Abstract
Consumption of unsafe water is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in developing regions. Pasteurizing or boiling water to remove pathogens is energy&#8208;intensive and often impractical to off&#8208;grid communities. Therefore, low capital cost, rapid and energy&#8208;efficient water disinfection methods are urgently required to address global challenges of safe water access. Here, anti&#8208;bacterial hydrogels (ABHs) with catechol&#8208;enabled molecular&#8208;level hydrogen peroxide generators and quinone&#8208;anchored activated carbon particles are designed for effective water treatment. The bactericidal effect is attributed to the synergy of hydrogen peroxide and quinone groups to attack essential cell components and disturb bacterial metabolism. ABHs can be directly used as tablets to achieve &gt;99.999% water disinfection efficiency within 60&#160;min without energy input. No harmful byproducts are formed during the treatment process, after which the ABH tablets can be easily removed without residues. Taking advantage of their excellent photothermal and biofouling&#8208;resistant properties, ABHs can also be applied as solar evaporators to achieve stable water purification under sunlight (&#8804;1&#160;kW m&#8722;2) after months of storage and operation in bacteria&#8208;containing river water. The ABH platform offers reduced energy and chemical demands for point&#8208;of&#8208;use water treatment technologies in remote areas and emergency rescue applications.

The &gt;105 discrepancy between recent reports of proton diffusion constants in halide perovskites is analyzed and it is found that the lower value is likely correct. The higher diffusion rate determined from single crystals may be the result of high&#8208;diffusivity pathways.








Abstract
A recent report by Cahen and co&#8208;workers is examined that finds the diffusion constant for proton migration in methylammonium lead triiodide single crystals to be 2 &#215; 105&#8208;fold greater than that previously reported by Sadhu et&#160;al. By comparing the conversion of single crystals versus microcrystalline samples, it is concluded that proton diffusion in macroscopic single crystals is accelerated by the presence of defects acting as high&#8208;diffusivity paths.

         <title>Response to Comment on &#8220;Eppur si Muove: Proton Diffusion in Halide Perovskite Single Crystals&#8221;: Measure What is Measurable, and Make Measurable What is Not So: Discrepancies between Proton Diffusion in Halide Perovskite Single Crystals and Thin Films</title>

What can explain the 105 times difference higher value of the proton diffusion coefficient in iodide perovskite single crystals relative to other reported values in thin films? Instead of migration through imperfections, which is shown to be highly improbable, experimentally testable alternatives are proposed.








Abstract
Buffeteau et&#160;al. note that the proton diffusion coefficient in MAPbI3 that is deduced (by the authors) from results, obtained by a suite of complementary techniques, on a large number of single crystals (Adv. Mater. 2020, 32, 2002467) is 5 orders of magnitude higher than what is estimated (by them) in J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2020, 142, 10431, from infrared spectroscopy on ultrathin MAPbI3 films; use of (deuterium/hydrogen) D/H isotope substitution is common to both studies. Buffeteau et&#160;al. speculated that proton diffusion in halide perovskite single crystals is dominated by 1D defects, which will somehow not be present in thin films, as those are made up of small&#8208;sized crystallites. It is shown here that the idea of a 1D defect is not supported by the body of experimental data gathered on these crystals, that the statistical analysis employed in to Buffeteau et&#160;al. to support the criticism is problematic, and it is concluded that the source of the difference must lie elsewhere. Constructive suggestions for this difference are provided and experiments to discern between possible reasons for it are proposed.

Perovskite Photodetectors
In article number 2101714, Wei Tian, Liang Li, and co&#8208;workers report a practical method to adjust the phase distribution in 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskites to construct efficient and stable perovskite photodetectors. The ordered arrangement of phase compositions facilitates the separation and transportation of photogenerated charge carriers, and endows the device with improved performance and environmental stability.

&lt;p&gt;In article number &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202101714"&gt;2101714&lt;/a&gt;, Wei Tian, Liang Li, and co-workers report a practical method to adjust the phase distribution in 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskites to construct efficient and stable perovskite photodetectors. The ordered arrangement of phase compositions facilitates the separation and transportation of photogenerated charge carriers, and endows the device with improved performance and environmental stability.

Microbatteries
The proliferation and performance of physically small electronics have been severely limited by the microbatteries that power them. In article number 2101760, John B. Cook, Paul V. Braun, James H. Pikul, and co&#8208;workers report a new design paradigm for primary microbatteries that drastically improves energy and power density through the use of thick and near&#8208;fully dense electrodeposited cathodes and multifunctional current collectors that eliminate most of the hermetic packaging.

Biocompatible Materials
The history of biomaterials began with naturally derived materials such as nacre and animal tissues. Gradually mankind developed more advanced materials such as metals, ceramics, alloys and polymers to yield prosthetics and implants. Flexible and reconfigurable materials such as &#8220;CareGum&#8221; are slowly changing the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art by yielding flexible human&#8211;machine interfaces (e.g., bionic eyes, brain implants, heart patches, and bionic wearables (like the electronic glove developed by Alireza Dolatshahi&#8208;Pirouz in article number 2100047)).

Liquid Crystals
A new class of cholesteric phase with local polar order is realized by Fumito Araoka and Hiroya Nishikawa in article number 2101305. In general, the periodicity of the conventional cholesteric liquid crystal corresponds to the half&#8208;pitch of the helix, having head&#8208;and&#8208;tail symmetry in the local nematic director. On the other hand, the newly found polar cholesteric liquid crystal is characterized with a full&#8208;pitch periodicity of the helix due to the polar degeneracy in the local nematic director. This delivers some unprecedented properties, such as fast electro&#8208;optic response based on the photonic band modulated with polar helix deformation.

         <title>Materials with Electroprogrammable Stiffness</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel applications, such as soft robotics and haptics, require emerging material systems whose stiffness can be selectively programmed using an electrical input to increase performance and simplify designs. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art materials with electroprogrammable stiffness are reviewed, categorizing them into those governed by electrostatics and phase&#8208;changes, and identifying challenges and opportunities toward the next generation of stimuli&#8208;responsive materials.








Abstract
Stiffness is a mechanical property of vital importance to any material system and is typically considered a static quantity. Recent work, however, has shown that novel materials with programmable stiffness can enhance the performance and simplify the design of engineered systems, such as morphing wings, robotic grippers, and wearable exoskeletons. For many of these applications, the ability to program stiffness with electrical activation is advantageous because of the natural compatibility with electrical sensing, control, and power networks ubiquitous in autonomous machines and robots.

     alt="Materials with Electroprogrammable Stiffness"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novel applications, such as soft robotics and haptics, require emerging material systems whose stiffness can be selectively programmed using an electrical input to increase performance and simplify designs. The state-of-the-art materials with electroprogrammable stiffness are reviewed, categorizing them into those governed by electrostatics and phase-changes, and identifying challenges and opportunities toward the next generation of stimuli-responsive materials.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stiffness is a mechanical property of vital importance to any material system and is typically considered a static quantity. Recent work, however, has shown that novel materials with programmable stiffness can enhance the performance and simplify the design of engineered systems, such as morphing wings, robotic grippers, and wearable exoskeletons. For many of these applications, the ability to program stiffness with electrical activation is advantageous because of the natural compatibility with electrical sensing, control, and power networks ubiquitous in autonomous machines and robots. The numerous applications for materials with electrically driven stiffness modulation has driven a rapid increase in the number of publications in this field. Here, a comprehensive review of the available materials that realize electroprogrammable stiffness is provided, showing that all current approaches can be categorized as using electrostatics or electrically activated phase changes, and summarizing the advantages, limitations, and applications of these materials. Finally, a perspective identifies state-of-the-art trends and an outlook of future opportunities for the development and use of materials with electroprogrammable stiffness.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;Powered Respiration Monitoring Enabled By a Triboelectric Nanogenerator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Respiration carries a wealth of physiologically relevant information as well as clues to potential diseases. An overview of TENG&#8208;enabled self&#8208;powered respiration monitoring, with a focus on the working principle, sensing materials, functional structures, and related applications in both physical respiration motion monitoring and chemical breath analysis, is presented.








Abstract
In mammals, physiological respiration involves respiratory cycles of inhaled and exhaled breaths, which has traditionally been an underutilized resource potentially encompassing a wealth of physiologically relevant information as well as clues to potential diseases. Recently, triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have been widely adopted for self&#8208;powered respiration monitoring owing to their compelling features, such as decent biocompatibility, wearing comfort, low&#8208;cost, and high sensitivity to respiration activities in the aspect of low frequency and slight amplitude body motions. Physiological respiration behaviors and exhaled chemical regents can be precisely and continuously monitored by TENG&#8208;based respiration sensors for personalized health care. This article presents an overview of TENG enabled self&#8208;powered respiration monitoring, with a focus on the working principle, sensing materials, functional structures, and related applications in both physical respiration motion detection and chemical breath analysis. Concepts and approaches for acquisition of physical information associated with respiratory rate and depth are covered in the first part. Then the sensing mechanism, theoretical modeling, and applications related to detection of chemicals released from breathing gases are systemically summarized. Finally, the opportunities and challenges of triboelectric effect enabled self&#8208;powered respiration monitoring are comprehensively discussed and criticized.

         <title>Ultrafast Electron Tunneling Devices&#8212;From Electric&#8208;Field Driven to Optical&#8208;Field Driven</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrafast electron tunneling devices are summarized. Compared to conventional semiconductor&#8208;based electron transport devices, electron tunneling devices can provide, significantly, much faster response time due to near&#8208;instantaneous tunneling that occurs on femtosecond timescales. The central tenet of optical&#8208;field&#8208;driven tunneling devices is realizing sub&#8208;optical&#8208;cycle response lightwave electronics.








Abstract
The search for ever higher frequency information processing has become an area of intense research activity within the micro, nano, and optoelectronics communities. Compared to conventional semiconductor&#8208;based diffusive transport electron devices, electron tunneling devices provide significantly faster response times due to near&#8208;instantaneous tunneling that occurs at sub&#8208;femtosecond timescales. As a result, the enhanced performance of electron tunneling devices is demonstrated, time and again, to reimagine a wide variety of traditional electronic devices with a variety of new &#8220;lightwave electronics&#8221; emerging, each capable of reducing the electron transport channel transit time down to attosecond timescales. In response to unprecedented rapid progress within this field, here the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in electron tunneling devices is reviewed, current challenges and opportunities are highlighted, and possible future research directions are identified.

         <title>Energy Autonomous Sweat&#8208;Based Wearable Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sweat&#8208;based energy harvesting and storage devices, along with the key components of sweat&#8208;based energy autonomous wearables systems are comprehensively reviewed. Various considerations such as the power management and the sweat extraction, etc., are discussed for continuous operation of sweat&#8208;based systems.








Abstract
The continuous operation of wearable electronics demands reliable sources of energy, currently met through Li&#8208;ion batteries and various energy harvesters. These solutions are being used out of necessity despite potential safety issues and unsustainable environmental impact. Safe and sustainable energy sources can boost the use of wearables systems in diverse applications such as health monitoring, prosthetics, and sports. In this regard, sweat&#8208; and sweat&#8208;equivalent&#8208;based studies have attracted tremendous attention through the demonstration of energy&#8208;generating biofuel cells, promising power densities as high as 3.5&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, storage using sweat&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;based supercapacitors with energy and power densities of 1.36&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and 329.70 W&#160;kg&#8722;1, respectively, and sweat&#8208;activated batteries with an impressive energy density of 67 Ah kg&#8722;1. A combination of these energy generating, and storage devices can lead to fully energy&#8208;autonomous wearables capable of providing sustainable power in the &#181;W to mW range, which is sufficient to operate both sensing and communication devices. Here, a comprehensive review covering these advances, addressing future challenges and potential solutions related to fully energy&#8208;autonomous wearables is presented, with emphasis on sweat&#8208;based energy storage and energy generation elements along with sweat&#8208;based sensors as applications.
