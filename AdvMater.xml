      <title>A Metal&#8211;Organic Framework as a Multifunctional Ionic Sieve Membrane for Long&#8208;Life Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Iodide Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Space&#8208;resolution Raman and micro&#8208;IR spectroscopies have originally revealed the negative influence of water and iodine species to zinc anode. Here, a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) membrane is adopted to concurrently suppress shuttling of triiodide and regulate electrolyte solvation. Benefited from MOF membrane, aqueous zinc&#8211;iodide battery achieves long&#8208;life (&gt;6000 cycles), high capacity retention (84.6%), and high reversibility (Coulombic efficiency: 99.65%).








Abstract
The introduction of the redox couple of triiodide/iodide (I3&#8722;/I&#8722;) into aqueous rechargeable zinc batteries is a promising energy&#8208;storage resource owing to its safety and cost&#8208;effectiveness. Nevertheless, the limited lifespan of zinc&#8211;iodine (Zn&#8211;I2) batteries is currently far from satisfactory owing to the uncontrolled shuttling of triiodide and unfavorable side&#8208;reactions on the Zn anode. Herein, space&#8208;resolution Raman and micro&#8208;IR spectroscopies reveal that the Zn anode suffers from corrosion induced by both water and iodine species. Then, a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) is exploited as an ionic sieve membrane to simultaneously resolve these problems for Zn&#8211;I2 batteries. The multifunctional MOF membrane, first, suppresses the shuttling of I3&#8722; and restrains related parasitic side&#8208;reaction on the Zn anode. Furthermore, by regulating the electrolyte solvation structure, the MOF channels construct a unique electrolyte structure (more aggregative ion associations than in saturated electrolyte). With the concurrent improvement on both the iodine cathode and the Zn anode, Zn&#8211;I2 batteries achieve an ultralong lifespan (&gt;6000 cycles), high capacity retention (84.6%), and high reversibility (Coulombic efficiency: 99.65%). This work not only systematically reveals the parasitic influence of free water and iodine species to the Zn anode, but also provides an efficient strategy to develop long&#8208;life aqueous Zn&#8211;I2 batteries.

     alt="A Metal&#8211;Organic Framework as a Multifunctional Ionic Sieve Membrane for Long&#8208;Life Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Iodide Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Space&#8208;resolution Raman and micro&#8208;IR spectroscopies have originally revealed the negative influence of water and iodine species to zinc anode. Here, a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) membrane is adopted to concurrently suppress shuttling of triiodide and regulate electrolyte solvation. Benefited from MOF membrane, aqueous zinc&#8211;iodide battery achieves long&#8208;life (&amp;gt;6000 cycles), high capacity retention (84.6%), and high reversibility (Coulombic efficiency: 99.65%).


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The introduction of the redox couple of triiodide/iodide (I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) into aqueous rechargeable zinc batteries is a promising energy&#8208;storage resource owing to its safety and cost&#8208;effectiveness. Nevertheless, the limited lifespan of zinc&#8211;iodine (Zn&#8211;I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) batteries is currently far from satisfactory owing to the uncontrolled shuttling of triiodide and unfavorable side&#8208;reactions on the Zn anode. Herein, space&#8208;resolution Raman and micro&#8208;IR spectroscopies reveal that the Zn anode suffers from corrosion induced by both water and iodine species. Then, a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) is exploited as an ionic sieve membrane to simultaneously resolve these problems for Zn&#8211;I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries. The multifunctional MOF membrane, first, suppresses the shuttling of I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and restrains related parasitic side&#8208;reaction on the Zn anode. Furthermore, by regulating the electrolyte solvation structure, the MOF channels construct a unique electrolyte structure (more aggregative ion associations than in saturated electrolyte). With the concurrent improvement on both the iodine cathode and the Zn anode, Zn&#8211;I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries achieve an ultralong lifespan (&amp;gt;6000 cycles), high capacity retention (84.6%), and high reversibility (Coulombic efficiency: 99.65%). This work not only systematically reveals the parasitic influence of free water and iodine species to the Zn anode, but also provides an efficient strategy to develop long&#8208;life aqueous Zn&#8211;I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Wood Derived Cellulose Scaffolds&#8212;Processing and Mechanics</title>
      <dc:description>
Wood&#8208;derived cellulose materials by structure&#8208;retaining delignification show excellent mechanical properties and facilitate the embedding of advanced functionality. To pave the way for a multitude of applications and substitute less ecofriendly materials, future research needs to focus on a deeper understanding of the impact of the various processing steps and the resulting structure&#8211;property relationships.








Abstract
Wood&#8208;derived cellulose materials obtained by structure&#8208;retaining delignification are attracting increasing attention due to their excellent mechanical properties and great potential to serve as renewable and CO2 storing cellulose scaffolds for advanced hybrid materials with embedded functionality. Various delignification protocols and a multitude of further processing steps including polymer impregnation and densification are applied resulting in a large range of properties. However, treatment optimization requires a more comprehensive characterization of the developed materials in terms of structure, chemical composition, and mechanical properties for faster progress in the field. Herein, the current protocols for structure&#8208;retaining delignification are reviewed and the emphasis is placed on the mechanical characterization at different hierarchical levels of the cellulose scaffolds by experiments and modeling to reveal the underlying structure&#8211;property relationships.

      <title>Nanocellulose in Emulsions and Heterogeneous Water&#8208;Based Polymer Systems: A Review</title>
      <dc:description>
Nanocelluloses have unique properties and have been shown to assemble at oil&#8211;water interfaces and impart new functionality to emulsions and latexes. The use of nanocellulose in both emulsions and heterogeneous water&#8208;based polymer systems is reported. Comprehensive tables with past work employing nanocellulose as stabilizers or additives are presented, and properties that can be tailored through the use of nanocellulose are highlighted.








Abstract
Nanocelluloses (i.e., bacterial nanocellulose, cellulose nanocrystals, and cellulose nanofibrils) are cellulose&#8208;based materials with at least one dimension in the nanoscale. These materials have unique and useful properties and have been shown to assemble at oil&#8211;water interfaces and impart new functionality to emulsion and latex systems. Herein, the use of nanocellulose in both emulsions and heterogeneous water&#8208;based polymers is reviewed, including dispersion, suspension, and emulsion polymerization. Comprehensive tables describe past work employing nanocellulose as stabilizers or additives and the properties that can be tailored through the use of nanocellulose are highlighted. Even at low loadings, nanocellulose offers an unprecedented level of control as a property modifier for a range of emulsion and polymer applications, influencing, for example, emulsion type, stability, and stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior. Nanocellulose can tune polymer particle properties such as size, surface charge, and morphology, or be used to produce capsules and polymer nanocomposites with enhanced mechanical, thermal, and adhesive properties. The role of nanocellulose is discussed, and a perspective for future direction is presented.

      <title>Better, Faster, and Less Biased Machine Learning: Electromechanical Switching in Ferroelectric Thin Films</title>
      <dc:description>
A fast, easily implementable approach to improve the interpretability of machine&#8208;learning analyses in materials science is demonstrated. Systematic application of techniques and parameter selection curtails the influence of overinterpretation, reduces user bias, and ultimately improves the quality of such studies. Previously identified exotic phenomena in ferroelectric films can be thus well described by classic ferroelectric and non&#8208;ferroelectric phenomena.








Abstract
Machine&#8208;learning techniques are more and more often applied to the analysis of complex behaviors in materials research. Frequently used to identify fundamental behaviors within large and multidimensional datasets, these techniques are strictly based on mathematical models. Thus, without inherent physical or chemical meaning or constraints, they are prone to biased interpretation. The interpretability of machine&#8208;learning results in materials science, specifically materials&#8217; functionalities, can be vastly improved through physical insights and careful data handling. The use of techniques such as dimensional stacking can provide the much needed physical and chemical constraints, while proper understanding of the assumptions imposed by model parameters can help avoid overinterpretation. These concepts are illustrated by application to recently reported ferroelectric switching experiments in PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 thin films. Through systematic analysis and introduction of physical constraints, it is argued that the behaviors present are not necessarily due to exotic mechanisms previously suggested, but rather well described by classical ferroelectric switching superimposed by non&#8208;ferroelectric phenomena, such as electrochemical deformation, electrostatic interactions, and/or charge injection.

      <title>Facile Morphological Qualification of Transferred Graphene by Phase&#8208;Shifting Interferometry</title>
      <dc:description>
Phase&#8208;shifting interferometry (PSI) is successfully demonstrated as a non&#8208;destructive, fast, accurate, and reproducible imaging tool to measure the morphological quality of transferred graphene, compared to conventional imaging tools. Very fine structures, such as graphene wrinkles, various polymer residues on graphene, and tear&#237;ng/opening of graphene can be successfully visualized using PSI in a one&#8208;shot measurement within few seconds.








Abstract
Post&#8208;growth graphene transfer to a variety of host substrates for circuitry fabrication has been among the most popular subjects since its successful development via chemical vapor deposition in the past decade. Fast and reliable evaluation tools for its morphological characteristics are essential for the development of defect&#8208;free transfer protocols. The implementation of conventional techniques, such as Raman spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and transmission electron microscopy in production quality control at an industrial scale is difficult because they are limited to local areas, are time consuming, and their operation is complex. However, through a one&#8208;shot measurement within a few seconds, phase&#8208;shifting interferometry (PSI) successfully scans &#8776;1 mm2 of transferred graphene with a vertical resolution of &#8776;0.1&#160;nm. This provides crucial morphological information, such as the surface roughness derived from polymer residues, the thickness of the graphene, and its adhesive strength with respect to the target substrates. Graphene samples transferred via four different methods are evaluated using PSI, Raman spectroscopy, and AFM. Although the thickness of the nanomaterials measured by PSI can be highly sensitive to their refractive indices, PSI is successfully demonstrated to be a powerful tool for investigating the morphological characteristics of the transferred graphene for industrial and research purposes.

      <title>Imidazolium&#8208;Functionalized Diacetylene Amphiphiles: Strike a Lighter and Wear Polaroid Glasses to Decipher the Secret Code</title>
      <dc:description>
Information is encrypted into a secret code with imidazolium&#8208;functionalized diacetylene secret inks that respond to heat as well as polarization. The secret code can be deciphered by wearing polaroid glasses and holding a flashlight.








Abstract
The development of smart inks that change color and transparency in response to external stimuli is very important for various fields, from modern art to safety and anticounterfeiting technology. A uniaxially oriented diacetylene thin film on a macroscopic area is obtained by coating, self&#8208;assembling and topochemical photopolymerizing of imidazolium&#8208;functionalized diacetylenes (M&#8208;DA and T&#8208;DA) and 4,6&#8208;decadiyne ink (70 wt%:20 wt%:10 wt%) exhibiting a lyotropic smectic A liquid&#8208;crystalline phase at room temperature. The color and transparency of letters and symbols written with the DA&#8208;based secret inks change reversibly from blue to red as well as from colorless transparent to black opaque depending on the temperature and polarization axis. A secret code written with thermoresponsive and polarization&#8208;dependent secret inks consisting of imidazolium&#8208;functionalized diacetylenes is successfully deciphered by wearing polaroid glasses and holding a flashlight.

      <title>A Cost&#8208;Effective, Aqueous&#8208;Solution&#8208;Processed Cathode Interlayer Based on Organosilica Nanodots for Highly Efficient and Stable Organic Solar Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
An aqueous solution&#8208;processed cathode interlayer based on cost&#8208;effective organosilica nanodots (OSiNDs) is demonstrated for organic solar cells (OSCs) with power conversion efficiency over 17% and excellent operational stability. The high photostability of OSiNDs&#8208;based OSCs is attributed to the avoidance of photo&#8208;induced shunts and the photocatalyst effect, which are ineluctable shortcomings in inverted OSCs based on ZnO cathode interlayers.








Abstract
The performance and industrial viability of organic photovoltaics are strongly influenced by the functionality and stability of interface layers. Many of the interface materials most commonly used in the lab are limited in their operational stability or their materials cost and are frequently not transferred toward large&#8208;scale production and industrial applications. In this work, an advanced aqueous&#8208;solution&#8208;processed cathode interface layer is demonstrated based on cost&#8208;effective organosilica nanodots (OSiNDs) synthesized via a simple one&#8208;step hydrothermal reaction. Compared to the interface layers optimized for inverted organic solar cells (i&#8208;OSCs), the OSiNDs cathode interlayer shows improved charge carrier extraction and excellent operational stability for various model photoactive systems, achieving a remarkably high power conversion efficiency up to 17.15%. More importantly, the OSiNDs&#8217; interlayer is extremely stable under thermal stress or photoillumination (UV and AM 1.5G) and undergoes no photochemical reaction with the photoactive materials used. As a result, the operational stability of inverted OSCs under continuous 1 sun illumination (AM 1.5G, 100&#160;mW cm&#8722;2) is significantly improved by replacing the commonly used ZnO interlayer with OSiND&#8208;based interfaces.

      <title>Mechanics Design in Cellulose&#8208;Enabled High&#8208;Performance Functional Materials</title>
      <dc:description>
The structure&#8211;mechanics relationships of cellulose molecular chains give rise to unconventional cellulose&#8208;based functional materials that possess multiple beneficial mechanical properties such as high strength and toughness, in addition to other fundamentally attractive properties such as low&#8208;cost, lightweight, and sustainability.








Abstract
The abundance of cellulose found in natural resources such as wood, and the wide spectrum of structural diversity of cellulose nanomaterials in the form of micro&#8208;nano&#8208;sized particles and fibers, have sparked a tremendous interest to utilize cellulose's intriguing mechanical properties in designing high&#8208;performance functional materials, where cellulose's structure&#8211;mechanics relationships are pivotal. In this progress report, multiscale mechanics understanding of cellulose, including the key role of hydrogen bonding, the dependence of structural interfaces on the spatial hydrogen bond density, the effect of nanofiber size and orientation on the fracture toughness, are discussed along with recent development on enabling experimental design techniques such as structural alteration, manipulation of anisotropy, interface and topology engineering. Progress in these fronts renders cellulose a prospect of being effectuated in an array of emerging sustainable applications and being fabricated into high&#8208;performance structural materials that are both strong and tough.

      <title>Redistributing Li&#8208;Ion Flux by Parallelly Aligned Holey Nanosheets for Dendrite&#8208;Free Li Metal Anodes</title>
      <dc:description>
Parallelly aligned holey 2D materials on a lithium metal anode are designed to redistribute nonuniform Li&#8208;ion flux both in the electrolyte and in the solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase, as well as to provide fast Li&#8208;ion transport. The protected Li anode achieves ultralong lifetime with low overpotential at a high rate with high capacity.








Abstract
Li metal is the most ideal anode material to assemble rechargeable batteries with high energy density. However, nonuniform Li&#8208;ion flux during repeated Li plating and stripping leads to continuous Li dendrite growth and dead Li formation, which causes safety risks and short lifetime and thus impedes the commercialization of Li metal batteries. Here, parallelly aligned holey nanosheets on a Li metal anode are reported to simultaneously redistribute the Li&#8208;ion flux in the electrolyte and in the solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase, which allows uniform Li&#8208;ion distribution as well as fast Li&#8208;ion diffusion for reversible Li plating and stripping. With holey MgO nanosheets as an example, the protected Li anodes achieve Coulombic efficiency of &#8776;99% and ultralong&#8208;term reversible Li plating/stripping over 2500 h at a high current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2. A full&#8208;cell battery, using the protected anode, a 4 V Li&#8208;ion cathode, and a commercial carbonate electrolyte, shows capacity retention of 90.9% after 500 cycles.

      <title>Zeolite (In)Stability under Aqueous or Steaming Conditions</title>
      <dc:description>
The factors critical for zeolite (in)stability in the presence of water under various conditions are reviewed from the experimental and computational sides. Situations when partial zeolite hydrolysis is used beneficially, such as the formation of hierarchical zeolites, synthesis of new zeolites or fine&#8208;tuning catalytic or adsorption characteristics of zeolites are covered as well.








Abstract
Zeolites are among the most environmentally friendly materials produced industrially at the Megaton scale. They find numerous commercial applications, particularly in catalysis, adsorption, and separation. Under ambient conditions aluminosilicate zeolites are stable when exposed to water or water vapor. However, at extreme conditions as high temperature, high water vapor pressure or increased acidity/basicity, their crystalline framework can be destroyed. The stability of the zeolite framework under aqueous conditions also depends on the concentration and character of heteroatoms (other than Al) and the topology of the zeolite. The factors critical for zeolite (in)stability in the presence of water under various conditions are reviewed from the experimental as well as computational sides. Nonreactive and reactive interactions of water with zeolites are addressed. The goal of this review is to provide a comparative overview of all&#8208;silica zeolites, aluminosilicates and zeolites with other heteroatoms (Ti, Sn, and Ge) when contacted with water. Due attention is also devoted to the situation when partial zeolite hydrolysis is used beneficially, such as the formation of hierarchical zeolites, synthesis of new zeolites or fine&#8208;tuning catalytic or adsorption characteristics of zeolites.

      <title>Organic Nanocomposites: Supramolecular Porous Organic Nanocomposites for Heterogeneous Photocatalysis of a Sulfur Mustard Simulant (Adv. Mater. 32/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
Manipulating the excited&#8208;state evolution in host&#8211;guest complexes is of importance in developing new applications for organic molecular materials. In particular, the efficient production of triplet&#8208;excited states in organic compounds upon light photoexcitation is of interest because of its wide range of applications. In article number 2001592, Joseph T. Hupp, J. Fraser Stoddart, and co&#8208;workers report new organic nanocomposites that combine both porosity and efficient photosensitizing properties for the detoxification of Sulfur Mustard simulant.

      <title>Perovskite Photodetectors: Perovskite Granular Wire Photodetectors with Ultrahigh Photodetectivity (Adv. Mater. 32/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article number 2002357, Sang Kyu Kwak, Joon Hak Oh, and co&#8208;workers synthesize perovskite granular wires by a simple yet effective template&#8208;free self&#8208;assembly. Superb photodetection performance with unprecedentedly high photodetectivity is exhibited, which originates from the low dark current due to the band&#8208;edge modulation along the long axis of the granular wires. This &#8220;self&#8208;assembled nanograin engineering&#8221; strategy provides a viable method for the development of high&#8208;performance perovskite photodetectors and can be extended to other integrated optoelectronic systems.

Different from the conventional reaction mechanism of batteries, this battery synchronizes the reversible Fe&#8211;Mo alloying&#8211;dealloying reactions with the delithiation&#8211;lithiation processes, meaning that the porous Mo skeleton derived from the dealloying reaction can suppress the growth of pure Fe particles. This approach is promising for other alkali metal&#8211;metal chloride battery systems.

      <title>Mechanotribological Aspects of MXene&#8208;Reinforced Nanocomposites</title>
      <dc:description>
A comprehensive insight is provided into the material, mechanical and tribological properties of the MXene nanolayers with discussions on the potential applications and the recent advancements attained in MXene&#8208;reinforced nanocomposites starting with the synthesis, fabrication techniques, intricacies of the underlying physics and mechanisms, and finally focusing on the progress in experimental and computational studies.








Abstract
MXenes are recently discovered 2D nanomaterial with superior mechanical, thermal, and tribological properties, being commonly employed in a wide variety of critical research areas, ranging from cancer therapy to energy and environmental applications. Due to their special properties, such as mechanoceramic nature with excellent mechanical performance, thermal stability and rich surface properties, MXenes have tremendous potential as advanced composite structures, especially those based on polymers due to a great affinity between macromolecules and the terminating groups of 2D MXenes. MXenes have been extensively explored in metal matrix nanocomposites as well as in solid&#8208; or liquid&#8208;based lubrication systems owing to the 2D structure and antifriction characteristics. The purpose of the this paper is to provide a comprehensive insight into the material, mechanical, and tribological properties of the MXene nanolayers with discussions on the recent advancements attained from MXene&#8208;reinforced nanocomposites starting with the synthesis, fabrication techniques, intricacies of the underlying physics and mechanisms, and finally focusing on the progress in computational studies. This analysis of MXene&#8208;based composites will stimulate an emerging field with innumerable opportunities and ample potentials to produce newfangled materials and structures with targeted properties.

      <title>Unconventional Charge&#8211;Spin Conversion in Weyl&#8208;Semimetal WTe2</title>
      <dc:description>
An outstanding feature of the topological Weyl semimetal WTe2 is its novel spin topologies in the electronic band structure. An unconventional charge&#8211;spin conversion in WTe2 due to its lower crystal symmetry combined with large Berry curvature and spin&#8208;texture of the Fermi states is demonstrated. These findings have great potential for utilizing WTe2 for spintronic circuits and quantum technologies.








Abstract
An outstanding feature of topological quantum materials is their novel spin topology in the electronic band structures with an expected large charge&#8208;to&#8208;spin conversion efficiency. Here, a charge&#8208;current&#8208;induced spin polarization in the type&#8208;II Weyl semimetal candidate WTe2 and efficient spin injection and detection in a graphene channel up to room temperature are reported. Contrary to the conventional spin Hall and Rashba&#8211;Edelstein effects, the measurements indicate an unconventional charge&#8208;to&#8208;spin conversion in WTe2, which is primarily forbidden by the crystal symmetry of the system. Such a large spin polarization can be possible in WTe2 due to a reduced crystal symmetry combined with its large spin Berry curvature, spin&#8211;orbit interaction with a novel spin&#8208;texture of the Fermi states. A robust and practical method is demonstrated for electrical creation and detection of such a spin polarization using both charge&#8208;to&#8208;spin conversion and its inverse phenomenon and utilized it for efficient spin injection and detection in the graphene channel up to room temperature. These findings open opportunities for utilizing topological Weyl materials as nonmagnetic spin sources in all&#8208;electrical van der Waals spintronic circuits and for low&#8208;power and high&#8208;performance nonvolatile spintronic technologies.

      <title>Perovskite Films with Reduced Interfacial Strains via a Molecular&#8208;Level Flexible Interlayer for Photovoltaic Application</title>
      <dc:description>
A protonated amino silane coupling agent as an interlayer is exploited on rigid and flexible substrates, which not only sets up well&#8208;matched growth underlay but also serves as a structural component of the lattice units, leading to less distorted perovskite films, resulting in an obvious advance in device performance, stability, and mechanical tolerance in the corresponding flexible device.








Abstract
Interface strains and lattice distortion are inevitable issues during perovskite crystallization. Silane as a coupling agent is a popular connector to enhance the compatibility between inorganic and organic materials in semiconductor devices. Herein, a protonated amine silane coupling agent (PASCA&#8208;Br) interlayer between TiO2 and perovskite layers is adopted to directionally grasp both of them by forming the structural component of a lattice unit. The pillowy alkyl ammonium bromide terminals at the upper side of the interlayer provide well&#8208;matched growth sites for the perovskite, leading to mitigated interface strain and ensuing lattice distortion; meanwhile, its superior chemical compatibility presents an ideal effect on healing the under&#8208;coordinated Pb atoms and halogen vacancies of bare perovskite crystals. The PASCA&#8208;Br interlayer also serves as a mechanical buffer layer, inducing less cracked perovskite film when bending. The developed molecular&#8208;level flexible interlayer provides a promising interfacial engineering for perovskite solar cells and their flexible application.

      <title>In Situ Designing a Gradient Li+ Capture and Quasi&#8208;Spontaneous Diffusion Anode Protection Layer toward Long&#8208;Life Li&#8722;O2 Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
A gradient LiF/F&#8208;doped carbon protection layer with synergistic functions of homogenizing Li+ flux, fast Li+ diffusion ability, and low Li+ diffusion barrier is prepared by one&#8208;step in situ reaction to solve the unstable lithium anode challenges in Li&#8722;O2 batteries, as a result, significantly boosting the cycling stability of the Li&#8722;O2 batteries.








Abstract
Lithium metal is the only anode material that can enable the Li&#8722;O2 battery to realize its high theoretical energy density (&#8776;3500 Wh kg&#8722;1). However, the inherent uncontrolled dendrite growth and serious corrosion limitations of lithium metal anodes make it experience fast degradation and impede the practical application of Li&#8722;O2 batteries. Herein, a multifunctional complementary LiF/F&#8208;doped carbon gradient protection layer on a lithium metal anode by one&#8208;step in situ reaction of molten Li with poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) is developed. The abundant strong polar C&#8208;F bonds in the upper carbon can not only act as Li+ capture site to pre&#8208;uniform Li+ flux but also regulate the electron configuration of LiF to make Li+ quasi&#8208;spontaneously diffuse from carbon to LiF surface, avoiding the strong Li+&#8208;adhesion&#8208;induced Li aggregation. For LiF, it can behave as fast Li+ conductor and homogenize the nucleation sites on lithium, as well as ensure firm connection with lithium. As a result, this well&#8208;designed protection layer endows the Li metal anode with dendrite&#8208;free plating/stripping and anticorrosion behavior both in ether&#8208;based and carbonate ester&#8208;based electrolytes. Even applied protected Li anodes in Li&#8722;O2 batteries, its superiority can still be maintained, making the cell achieve stable cycling performance (180 cycles).

      <title>Superhigh Uniform Magnetic Cr Substitution in a 2D Mo2C Superconductor for a Macroscopic&#8208;Scale Kondo Effect</title>
      <dc:description>
Controlled uniform lattice substitution of 2D Mo2C superconductor by magnetic Cr atoms is performed through chemical vapor deposition, with Cr concentration up to &#8776;46.9 at%. The controlled substitutional doping enables the tuning of the competition of the 2D superconductor and the Kondo effect across the whole sample, and the Kondo effect with a high Kondo temperature is achieved at high Cr concentration.








Abstract
Substitutional doping provides an effective strategy to tailor the properties of 2D materials, but it remains an open challenge to achieve tunable uniform doping, especially at high doping level. Here, uniform lattice substitution of a 2D Mo2C superconductor by magnetic Cr atoms with controlled concentration up to &#8776;46.9 at% by chemical vapor deposition and a specifically designed Cu/Cr/Mo trilayer growth substrate is reported. The concentration of Cr atoms can be easily tuned by simply changing the thickness of the Cr layer, and the samples retain the original structure of 2D Mo2C even at a very high Cr concentration. The controlled uniform Cr doping enables the tuning of the competition of the 2D superconductor and the Kondo effect across the whole sample. Transport measurements show that with increasing Cr concentration, the superconductivity of the 2D Cr&#8208;doped Mo2C crystals disappears along with the emergence of the Kondo effect, and the Kondo temperature increases monotonously. Using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, the mechanism of the doping level effect on the interplay and evolution between superconductivity and the Kondo effect is revealed. This work paves a new way for the synthesis of 2D materials with widely tunable doping levels, and provides new understandings on the interplay between superconductivity and magnetism in the 2D limit.

      <title>Spin&#8208;Related Electron Transfer and Orbital Interactions in Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>
A brief discussion on spin&#8208;related charge transfer and orbital interactions in oxygen electrocatalysis is provided. It is expected that a more comprehensive understanding of oxygen electrocatalysis probably can be established in the near future by including the role of electron spin.








Abstract
Oxygen evolution and reduction reactions play a critical role in determining the efficiency of the water cycling (H2O &#8660; H2 + 12O2), in which the hydrogen serves as the energy carrier. That calls for a comprehensive understanding of oxygen electrocatalysis for efficient catalyst design. Current opinions on oxygen electrocatalysis have been focused on the thermodynamics of the reactant/intermediate adsorption on the catalysts. Because the oxygen molecule is paramagnetic, its production from or its reduction to diamagnetic hydroxide/water involves spin&#8208;related electron transfer. Both electron transfer and orbital interactions between the catalyst and the reactant/intermediate show spin&#8208;dependent character, making the reaction kinetics and thermodynamics sensitive to the spin configurations. Herein, a brief introduction on the spintronic explanation of the catalytic phenomena on oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is given. The local spin configurations and orbital interactions in the benchmark transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts for OER and ORR are analyzed as examples. To further understand the spintronic oxygen electrocatalysis and to develop more efficient spintronic catalysts, the challenges are summarized and future opportunities proposed. Spin electrocatalysis may emerge as an important topic in the near future and help integrate a comprehensive understanding of oxygen electrocatalysis.

      <title>Layered Antiferromagnetism Induces Large Negative Magnetoresistance in the van der Waals Semiconductor CrSBr</title>
      <dc:description>
CrSBr is an air&#8208;stable, intrinsically magnetic, van der Waals semiconductor with an electronic bandgap &#8710;E&#160;=&#160;1.5&#160;&#177;&#160;0.2 eV and photoluminescence peak centered at 1.25 &#177; 0.07 eV. Magnetometry and magnetotransport measurements demonstrate that CrSBr exhibits intraplanar ferromagnetic ordering and interplanar antiferromagnetic ordering below TN&#160;&#8776;&#160;132&#160;&#177; 1 K, producing a large intrinsic negative magnetoresistance.








Abstract
The recent discovery of magnetism within the family of exfoliatable van der Waals (vdW) compounds has attracted considerable interest in these materials for both fundamental research and technological applications. However, current vdW magnets are limited by their extreme sensitivity to air, low ordering temperatures, and poor charge transport properties. Here the magnetic and electronic properties of CrSBr are reported, an air&#8208;stable vdW antiferromagnetic semiconductor that readily cleaves perpendicular to the stacking axis. Below its N&#233;el temperature, TN&#160;=&#160;132&#160;&#177;&#160;1&#160;K, CrSBr adopts an A&#8208;type antiferromagnetic structure with each individual layer ferromagnetically ordered internally and the layers coupled antiferromagnetically along the stacking direction. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy and photoluminescence (PL) reveal that the electronic gap is &#916;E&#160;=&#160;1.5&#160;&#177;&#160;0.2&#160;eV with a corresponding PL peak centered at 1.25&#160;&#177;&#160;0.07&#160;eV. Using magnetotransport measurements, strong coupling between magnetic order and transport properties in CrSBr is demonstrated, leading to a large negative magnetoresistance response that is unique among vdW materials. These findings establish CrSBr as a promising material platform for increasing the applicability of vdW magnets to the field of spin&#8208;based electronics.

      <title>Evaporated SexTe1&#8208;x Thin Films with Tunable Bandgaps for Short&#8208;Wave Infrared Photodetectors</title>
      <dc:description>
Thermally evaporated SexTe1&#8208;x alloy thin films with tunable bandgaps (from 0.31 eV to 1.87 eV) are prepared for the fabrication of high&#8208;performance short&#8208;wave infrared photodetectors. The Se0.32Te0.68 film&#8208;based photoconductor fabricated on an optical cavity substrate exhibits a cut&#8208;off wavelength at &#8776;1.7 &#181;m and gives a responsivity of 1.5 AW&#8722;1 and implied detectivity of 6.5 &#215; 1010 cm Hz1/2 W&#8722;1 at 1.55 &#181;m at room temperature.








Abstract
Semiconducting absorbers in high&#8208;performance short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) photodetectors and imaging sensor arrays are dominated by single&#8208;crystalline germanium and III&#8211;V semiconductors. However, these materials require complex growth and device fabrication procedures. Here, thermally evaporated SexTe1&#8208;x alloy thin films with tunable bandgaps for the fabrication of high&#8208;performance SWIR photodetectors are reported. From absorption measurements, it is shown that the bandgaps of SexTe1&#8208;x films can be tuned continuously from 0.31 eV (Te) to 1.87 eV (Se). Owing to their tunable bandgaps, the peak responsivity position and photoresponse edge of SexTe1&#8208;x film&#8208;based photoconductors can be tuned in the SWIR regime. By using an optical cavity substrate consisting of Au/Al2O3 to enhance its absorption near the bandgap edge, the Se0.32Te0.68 film (an optical bandgap of &#8776;0.8 eV)&#8208;based photoconductor exhibits a cut&#8208;off wavelength at &#8776;1.7 &#181;m and gives a responsivity of 1.5 AW&#8722;1 and implied detectivity of 6.5 &#215; 1010 cm Hz1/2 W&#8722;1 at 1.55 &#181;m at room temperature. Importantly, the nature of the thermal evaporation process enables the fabrication of Se0.32Te0.68&#8208;based 42 &#215; 42 focal plane arrays with good pixel uniformity, demonstrating the potential of this unique material system used for infrared imaging sensor systems.

      <title>The Use of Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Self&#8208;Assembly and Nanocellulose to Prepare Advanced Functional Materials</title>
      <dc:description>
The current literature on the use of layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer self&#8208;assembled structures of nanocelluloses and oppositely charged polyelectrolytes for the preparation of strong, adhesive, electrically interactive, and biologically interactive thin films is summarized. By using this renewable and biodegradable nanomaterial, it is shown possible to prepare high&#8208;performance materials in a noncomplicated way.








Abstract
The current knowledge about the formation of layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) self&#8208;assemblies using combinations of nanocelluloses (NCs) and polyelectrolytes is reviewed. Herein, the fundamentals behind the LbL formation, with a major focus on NCs, are considered. Following this, a special description of the limiting factors for the formation of LbLs of only NCs, both anionic and cationic, and the combination&#160;of NCs and polyelectrolytes/nanoparticles is provided. The ability of the NCs and polyelectrolytes to form dense films with excellent mechanical properties and with tailored optical properties is then reviewed. How low&#8208;density, wet stable&#160;networks of cellulose nanofibrils can be used as substrates for the preparation of antibacterial, electrically interactive, and fire&#8208;retardant materials by forming well&#8208;defined LbLs inside these networks is then considered. A short outlook of the possible uses of LbLs containing NCs is given to conclude.

      <title>3D Microstructures of Liquid Crystal Networks with Programmed Voxelated Director Fields</title>
      <dc:description>
3D liquid crystal network microstructures, such as micrometer&#8208;scale suspended films, helical coils, and circular rings, with programmable 3D director fields are demonstrated with direct laser writing. High&#8208;resolution (around 5 &#181;m) programmed fields are enabled by pixelated microchannels. Various shape morphing modes are obtained by varying the programmed 3D director fields inside the same liquid crystal network microstructures.








Abstract
The shape&#8208;shifting behavior of liquid crystal networks (LCNs) and elastomers (LCEs) is a result of an interplay between their initial geometrical shape and their molecular alignment. For years, reliance on either one&#8208;step in situ or two&#8208;step film processing techniques has limited the shape&#8208;change transformations from 2D to 3D geometries. The combination of various fabrication techniques, alignment methods, and chemical formulations developed in recent years has introduced new opportunities to achieve 3D&#8208;to&#8208;3D shape&#8208;transformations in large scales, albeit the precise control of local molecular alignment in microscale 3D constructs remains a challenge. Here, the voxel&#8208;by&#8208;voxel encoding of nematic alignment in 3D microstructures of LCNs produced by two&#8208;photon polymerization using high&#8208;resolution topographical features is demonstrated. 3D LCN microstructures (suspended films, coils, and rings) with designable 2D and 3D director fields with a resolution of 5 &#181;m are achieved. Different shape transformations of LCN microstructures with the same geometry but dissimilar molecular alignments upon actuation are elicited. This strategy offers higher freedom in the shape&#8208;change programming of 3D LCN microstructures and expands their applicability in emerging technologies, such as small&#8208;scale soft robots and devices and responsive surfaces.

      <title>In Situ Deprotection of Polymeric Binders for Solution&#8208;Processible Sulfide&#8208;Based All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Protection&#8722;deprotection chemistry is employed to resolve a dilemma pertaining to polarity compatibility among the binder, solvent, and solid electrolyte for sulfide&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries. The polar functional groups of the binder, initially protected by tert&#8208;butyl groups during the slurry mixing stage, are deprotected when the electrode is dried. The polar binder enhances electrode adhesion and electrochemical performance drastically.








Abstract
Sulfide&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) have been featured as promising alternatives to the current lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) mainly owing to their superior safety. Nevertheless, a solution&#8208;based scalable manufacturing scheme has not yet been established because of the incompatible polarity of the binder, solvent, and sulfide electrolyte during slurry preparation. This dilemma is overcome by subjecting the acrylate (co)polymeric binders to protection&#8722;deprotection chemistry. Protection by the&#160;tert&#8208;butyl group allows for homogeneous dispersion of the binder in the slurry based on a relatively less polar solvent, with subsequent heat&#8208;treatment during the drying process to cleave the&#160;tert&#8208;butyl group.

     alt="In Situ Deprotection of Polymeric Binders for Solution&#8208;Processible Sulfide&#8208;Based All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protection&#8722;deprotection chemistry is employed to resolve a dilemma pertaining to polarity compatibility among the binder, solvent, and solid electrolyte for sulfide&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries. The polar functional groups of the binder, initially protected by &lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;butyl groups during the slurry mixing stage, are deprotected when the electrode is dried. The polar binder enhances electrode adhesion and electrochemical performance drastically.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sulfide&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) have been featured as promising alternatives to the current lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) mainly owing to their superior safety. Nevertheless, a solution&#8208;based scalable manufacturing scheme has not yet been established because of the incompatible polarity of the binder, solvent, and sulfide electrolyte during slurry preparation. This dilemma is overcome by subjecting the acrylate (co)polymeric binders to protection&#8722;deprotection chemistry. Protection by the&#160;&lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;butyl group allows for homogeneous dispersion of the binder in the slurry based on a relatively less polar solvent, with subsequent heat&#8208;treatment during the drying process to cleave the&#160;&lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;butyl group. This exposes the polar carboxylic acid groups, which are then able to engage in hydrogen bonding with the active cathode material, high&#8208;nickel layered oxide. Deprotection strengthens the electrode adhesion such that the strength equals that of commercial LIB electrodes, and the key electrochemical performance parameters are improved markedly in both half&#8208;cell and full&#8208;cell settings. The present study highlights the potential of sulfide&#8208;based ASSBs for scalable manufacturing and also provides insights that protection&#8722;deprotection chemistry can generally be used for various battery cells that suffer from polarity incompatibility among multiple electrode components.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Compliant Ionic Adhesive Electrode with Ultralow Bioelectronic Impedance</title>
      <dc:description>
A compliant ionic adhesive electrode, based on an alginate&#8211;polyacrylamide (Alg&#8208;PAAm) hydrogel, with ultralow interfacial impedance on the skin is created to record dynamically weak surface electromyography signals with high SNR and low crosstalk. Due to excellent properties, a prosthetic hand is successfully driven to precisely grasp a needle based on the Alg&#8208;PAAm compliant electrodes.








Abstract
Simultaneous implementation of high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (SNR) but low crosstalk is of great importance for weak surface electromyography (sEMG) signals when precisely driving a prosthesis to perform sophisticated activities. However, due to gaps with the curved skin during muscle contraction, many electrodes have poor compliance with skin and suffer from high bioelectrical impedance. This causes serious noise and error in the signals, especially the signals from low&#8208;level muscle contractions. Here, the design of a compliant electrode based on an adhesive hydrogel, alginate&#8211;polyacrylamide (Alg&#8208;PAAm) is reported, which eliminates those large gaps through the strong electrostatic interaction and abundant hydrogen bond with the skin. The obtained compliant electrode, having an ultralow bioelectrical impedance of &#8776;20 k&#937;, can monitor even 2.1% maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) of muscle. Furthermore, benefiting from the high SNR of &gt;5:1 at low&#8208;level MVC, the crosstalk from irrelevant muscle is minimized through reducing the electrode size. Finally, a prosthesis is successfully demonstrated to precisely grasp a needle based on a 9 mm2 Alg&#8208;PAAm compliant electrode. The strategy to design such compliant electrodes provides the potential for improving the quality of dynamically weak sEMG signals to precisely control prosthesis in performing purposefully dexterous activity.

      <title>Suppressing Defects&#8208;Induced Nonradiative Recombination for Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells through Green Antisolvent Engineering</title>
      <dc:description>
Antisolvent engineering is employed to tune the crystal nucleation and grain growth of perovskite for achieving efficient perovskite solar cells. The engineering of green&#8208;antisolvent&#8208;MABr&#8208;Eth&#8208;treated perovskites suppressing defects&#8208;induced nonradiative recombination in perovskite solar cells is developed. As expected, the device delivers over 21% power conversion efficiency and a better storage and light&#8208;soaking stability.








Abstract
Organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites have attracted considerable attention due to their superior optoelectronic properties. Traditional one&#8208;step solution&#8208;processed perovskites often suffer from defects&#8208;induced nonradiative recombination, which significantly hinders the improvement of device performance. Herein, treatment with green antisolvents for achieving high&#8208;quality perovskite films is reported. Compared to defects&#8208;filled ones, perovskite films by antisolvent treatment using methylamine bromide (MABr) in ethanol (MABr&#8208;Eth) not only enhances the resultant perovskite crystallinity with large grain size, but also passivates the surface defects. In this case, the engineering of MABr&#8208;Eth&#8208;treated perovskites suppressing defects&#8208;induced nonradiative recombination in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is demonstrated. As a result, the fabricated inverted planar heterojunction device of ITO/PTAA/Cs0.15FA0.85PbI3/PC61BM/Phen&#8208;NADPO/Ag exhibits the best power conversion efficiency of 21.53%. Furthermore, the corresponding PSCs possess a better storage and light&#8208;soaking stability.

      <title>Laser Generation of Sub&#8208;Micrometer Wrinkles in a Chalcogenide Glass Film as Physical Unclonable Functions</title>
      <dc:description>
The formation of random patterns induced by a laser pulse focused on amorphous Ge&#8208;based chalcogenide thin film capped with a very thin SiN layer is demonstrated. These non&#8208;deterministic surface patterns are wrinkles of sub&#8208;100 nm height with a sub&#8208;micrometer periodicity that depends on the impinging laser fluence. Application as physical unclonable functions is demonstrated using a dedicated fast recognition algorithm.








Abstract
Laser interaction with solids is routinely used for functionalizing materials' surfaces. In most cases, the generation of patterns/structures is the key feature to endow materials with specific properties like hardening, superhydrophobicity, plasmonic color&#8208;enhancement, or dedicated functions like anti&#8208;counterfeiting tags. A way to generate random patterns, by means of generation of wrinkles on surfaces resulting from laser melting of amorphous Ge&#8208;based chalcogenide thin films, is presented. These patterns, similar to fingerprints, are modulations of the surface height by a few tens of nanometers with a sub&#8208;micrometer periodicity. It is shown that the patterns' spatial frequency depends on the melted layer thickness, which can be tuned by varying the impinging laser fluence. The randomness of these patterns makes them an excellent candidate for the generation of physical unclonable function tags (PUF&#8208;tags) for anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications. Two specific ways are tested to identify the obtained PUF&#8208;tag: cross&#8208;correlation procedure or using a neural network. In both cases, it is demonstrated that the PUF&#8208;tag can be compared to a reference image (PUF&#8208;key) and identified with a high recognition ratio on most real application conditions. This paves the way to straightforward non&#8208;deterministic PUF&#8208;tag generation dedicated to small sensitive parts such as, for example, electronic devices/components, jewelry, or watchmak.

      <title>3D Ordering at the Liquid&#8211;Solid Polar Interface of Nanowires</title>
      <dc:description>
Experimental observations and molecular dynamics simulations highlight&#160;the 3D nature of&#160;atomic&#8208;scale ordering of liquid Ga in contact with solid GaAs in a nanowire growth configuration, elucidating the&#160;role played by the liquid ordering in controlling the growth.








Abstract
The nature of the liquid&#8211;solid interface determines the characteristics of a variety of physical phenomena, including catalysis, electrochemistry, lubrication, and crystal growth. Most of the established models for crystal growth are based on macroscopic thermodynamics, neglecting the atomistic nature of the liquid&#8211;solid interface. Here, experimental observations and molecular dynamics simulations are employed to identify the 3D nature of an atomic&#8208;scale ordering of liquid Ga in contact with solid GaAs in a nanowire growth configuration. An interplay between the liquid ordering and the formation of a new bilayer is revealed, which, contrary to the established theories, suggests that the preference for a certain polarity and polytypism is influenced by the atomic structure of the interface. The conclusions of this work open new avenues for the understanding of crystal growth, as well as other processes and systems involving a liquid&#8211;solid interface.

      <title>In&#8208;Memory Computing with Memristor Content Addressable Memories for Pattern Matching</title>
      <dc:description>
Memristor content addressable memory (CAM) arrays with nanoscale memristor devices are developed experimentally and used to demonstrate two novel computing applications on&#8208;chip&#8212;network security intrusion detection using a finite state machine and definable inexact pattern matching in a Levenshtein automata for genomic sequencing. This work demonstrates the promise of in&#8208;memory compute circuits using emerging devices to accelerate broad computing applications.








Abstract
The dramatic rise of data&#8208;intensive workloads has revived application&#8208;specific computational hardware for continuing speed and power improvements, frequently achieved by limiting data movement and implementing &#8220;in&#8208;memory computation&#8221;. However, conventional complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) circuit designs can still suffer low power efficiency, motivating designs leveraging nonvolatile resistive random access memory (ReRAM), and with many studies focusing on crossbar circuit architectures. Another circuit primitive&#8212;content addressable memory (CAM)&#8212;shows great promise for mapping a diverse range of computational models for in&#8208;memory computation, with recent ReRAM&#8211;CAM designs proposed but few experimentally demonstrated.

     alt="In&#8208;Memory Computing with Memristor Content Addressable Memories for Pattern Matching"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memristor content addressable memory (CAM) arrays with nanoscale memristor devices are developed experimentally and used to demonstrate two novel computing applications on&#8208;chip&#8212;network security intrusion detection using a finite state machine and definable inexact pattern matching in a Levenshtein automata for genomic sequencing. This work demonstrates the promise of in&#8208;memory compute circuits using emerging devices to accelerate broad computing applications.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dramatic rise of data&#8208;intensive workloads has revived application&#8208;specific computational hardware for continuing speed and power improvements, frequently achieved by limiting data movement and implementing &#8220;in&#8208;memory computation&#8221;. However, conventional complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) circuit designs can still suffer low power efficiency, motivating designs leveraging nonvolatile resistive random access memory (ReRAM), and with many studies focusing on crossbar circuit architectures. Another circuit primitive&#8212;content addressable memory (CAM)&#8212;shows great promise for mapping a diverse range of computational models for in&#8208;memory computation, with recent ReRAM&#8211;CAM designs proposed but few experimentally demonstrated. Here, programming and control of memristors across an 86 &#215; 12 memristor ternary CAM (TCAM) array integrated with CMOS are demonstrated, and parameter tradeoffs for optimizing speed and search margin are evaluated. In addition to smaller area, this memristor TCAM results in significantly lower power due to very low programmable conductance states, motivating CAM use in a wider range of computational applications than conventional TCAMs are confined to today. Finally, the first experimental demonstration of two computational models in memristor TCAM arrays is reported: regular expression matching in a finite state machine for network security intrusion detection and definable inexact pattern matching in a Levenshtein automata for genomic sequencing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Shielding Polysulfide Intermediates by an Organosulfur&#8208;Containing Solid Electrolyte Interphase on the Lithium Anode in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
An organosulfur&#8208;containing solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is tailored for the stabilization of the Li anode in Li&#8211;S batteries by employing 3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)thiophenol as an electrolyte additive. The organosulfur&#8208;containing SEI protects the Li anode from the detrimental reactions with Li polysulfides (LiPSs). A Li&#8211;S battery delivers 82 cycles with an organosulfur&#8208;containing SEI in comparison to 42 cycles with a routine SEI under practical conditions.








Abstract
The lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) battery is regarded as a promising high&#8208;energy&#8208;density battery system, in which the dissolution&#8211;precipitation redox reactions of the S cathode are critical. However, soluble Li polysulfides (LiPSs), as the indispensable intermediates, easily diffuse to the Li anode and react with the Li metal severely, thus depleting the active materials and inducing the rapid failure of the battery, especially under practical conditions. Herein, an organosulfur&#8208;containing solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is tailored for the stabilizaiton of the Li anode in Li&#8211;S batteries by employing 3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)thiophenol as an electrolyte additive. The organosulfur&#8208;containing SEI protects the Li anode from the detrimental reactions with LiPSs and decreases its corrosion. Under practical conditions with a high&#8208;loading S cathode (4.5 mgS cm&#8722;2), a low electrolyte/S ratio (5.0&#160;&#181;L mgS&#8722;1), and an ultrathin Li anode (50&#160;&#181;m), a Li&#8211;S battery delivers 82 cycles with an organosulfur&#8208;containing SEI in comparison to 42 cycles with a routine SEI. This work provokes the vital insights into the role of the organic components of SEI in the protection of the Li anode in practical Li&#8211;S batteries.

A novel multifunctional theranostic nanoplatform based on both aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens and 2D black phosphorus nanomaterials is successfully developed. The presented hybrid nanotheranostic system possesses distinctive properties, endowing it with excellent performance for in vitro and in vivo cancer theranostics involving NIR fluorescence&#8211;photothermal dual imaging&#8208;guided synergistic photodynamic&#8211;photothermal therapies.








Abstract
Inspired by the respective advantages of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;active photosensitizers and black phosphorus nanomaterials in cancer treatment, the facile construction of novel AIE photosensitizers married to 2D black phosphorus nanosheets and their application for multimodal theranostics are demonstrated. The developed nanomaterial simultaneously possesses distinctive properties and multiple functions including excellent stability, good biocompatibility, intensive fluorescence emission in the NIR region, high&#8208;performance reactive oxygen species generation, good photothermal conversion efficiency, outstanding cellular uptake, and effective accumulation at the tumor site. Both in vitro and in vivo evaluation show that the presented nanotheranostic system is an excellent candidate for NIR fluorescence&#8211;photothermal dual imaging&#8208;guided synergistic photodynamic&#8211;photothermal therapies.

Abstract
Thermally insulating materials based on renewable nanomaterials such as nanocellulose could reduce the energy consumption and the environmental impact of the building sector.

Herein, the fundamental basis of thermal conductivity of porous materials is described, and the anisotropic heat transfer properties of CNMs and films with aligned CNMs and the processing and structure of novel CNM&#8208;based aerogels and foams with low thermal conductivities are presented and discussed.

      <title>High Photon Upconversion Efficiency with Hybrid Triplet Sensitizers by Ultrafast Hole&#8208;Routing in Electronic&#8208;Doped Nanocrystals</title>
      <dc:description>
Semiconductor nanocrystals doped with electronic impurities are proposed as triplet sensitizers in photon upconversion assisted by triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation (TTA). Upon photoexcitation, the nanocrystals&#8217; photoholes are routed to a long&#8208;living, impurity&#8208;related state in resonance with the capping ligands&#8217; triplet. This results in 100% efficiency in triplet sensitization and leads to the highest upconversion quantum yield ever achieved for nanocrystal&#8208;based TTA upconverters.








Abstract
Low&#8208;power photon upconversion (UC) based on sensitized triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation (sTTA) is considered as the most promising upward wavelength&#8208;shifting technique to enhance the light&#8208;harvesting capability of solar devices. Colloidal nanocrystals (NCs) with conjugated organic ligands have been recently proposed to extend the limited light&#8208;harvesting capability of molecular absorbers. Key to their functioning is efficient energy transfer (ET) from the NC to the triplet state of the ligands that sensitize free annihilator moieties responsible for the upconverted luminescence. The ET efficiency is typically limited by parasitic processes, above all nonradiative hole&#8208;transfer to the ligand highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO). Here, a new exciton&#8208;manipulation approach is demonstrated that enables loss&#8208;free ET by electronically doping CdSe NCs with gold impurities that introduce a hole&#8208;accepting intragap state above the HOMO energy of 9&#8208;anthracene acid ligands. Upon photoexcitation, the NC photoholes are rapidly routed to the Au&#8208;level, producing a long&#8208;lived bound exciton in perfect resonance with the ligand triplet. This hinders hole&#8208;transfer leading to &#8776;100% efficient ET that translates into an upconversion quantum yield as high as &#8776;12% (&#8776;24% in the normalized definition), which is the highest performance for NC&#8208;based upconverters based on sTTA to date and approaches the record efficiency of optimized organic systems.

      <title>Rational Design of MOF&#8208;Based Hybrid Nanomaterials for Directly Harvesting Electric Energy from Water Evaporation</title>
      <dc:description>
A metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based hybrid nanomaterial is rationally designed and synthesized. Due to the 2D morphology and high surface potential, a prototype device made of MOF&#8208;based hybrid nanomaterials can efficiently harvest the electric energy from water evaporation.








Abstract
The continuous exploration of clean&#8208;energy technology is critical for the sustainable development of society. The recent work on the electric energy harvesting from water evaporation has made a significant contribution to the utilization of clean energy for self&#8208;powering systems. Here, a novel metal&#8211;organic&#8208;framework&#8208;based hybrid nanomaterial is delicately designed and synthesized by the growth of UIO&#8208;66 nanoparticles on 2D AlOOH nanoflakes. Due to the combined merits from the 2D morphology, which is inherited from the AlOOH nanoflakes, and the high surface potential, which originates from the UIO&#8208;66 nanoparticles, the device made of the AlOOH/UIO&#8208;66 hybrid nanomaterials can harvest electric energy from natural water evaporation. An open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.63 &#177; 0.10 V can be achieved on the prototype devices made of the hybrid nanomaterial. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application, a small electric appliance, e.g., a digital calculator, is powered up by a 3 &#215; 3 device array connected in a combined series&#8211;parallel configuration.

     alt="Rational Design of MOF&#8208;Based Hybrid Nanomaterials for Directly Harvesting Electric Energy from Water Evaporation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based hybrid nanomaterial is rationally designed and synthesized. Due to the 2D morphology and high surface potential, a prototype device made of MOF&#8208;based hybrid nanomaterials can efficiently harvest the electric energy from water evaporation.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The continuous exploration of clean&#8208;energy technology is critical for the sustainable development of society. The recent work on the electric energy harvesting from water evaporation has made a significant contribution to the utilization of clean energy for self&#8208;powering systems. Here, a novel metal&#8211;organic&#8208;framework&#8208;based hybrid nanomaterial is delicately designed and synthesized by the growth of UIO&#8208;66 nanoparticles on 2D AlOOH nanoflakes. Due to the combined merits from the 2D morphology, which is inherited from the AlOOH nanoflakes, and the high surface potential, which originates from the UIO&#8208;66 nanoparticles, the device made of the AlOOH/UIO&#8208;66 hybrid nanomaterials can harvest electric energy from natural water evaporation. An open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.63 &#177; 0.10 V can be achieved on the prototype devices made of the hybrid nanomaterial. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application, a small electric appliance, e.g., a digital calculator, is powered up by a 3 &lt;b&gt;&#215;&lt;/b&gt; 3 device array connected in a combined series&#8211;parallel configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Highly Efficient and Stable Blue&#8208;Emitting Cs5Cu3Cl6I2 with a 1D Chain Structure</title>
      <dc:description>
A new Cu&#8208;based emitting material of Cs5Cu3Cl6I2 that exhibits ultrabright blue&#8208;emission with a near&#8208;unity quantum yield of &#8776;95% and outstanding long&#8208;term air&#8208;stability is reported. The single&#8208;crystal structure determination reveals that the Cs5Cu3Cl6I2 consists of 1D zigzag chains. Theoretical calculations and extensive comparative study clarify that the localized nature of the valence band maximum is essential in obtaining efficient self&#8208;trapped exciton emission.








Abstract
In the field of photonics, alkali copper(I) halides attract considerable attention as lead&#8208;free emitters. The intrinsic quantum confinement effects originating from low&#8208;dimensional electronic structure lead to high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs). Among them, Cs3Cu2I5 is the most promising candidate, satisfying both high PLQY and air stability. In this study, a strategy to explore a new material meeting these requirements through the use of the mixed&#8208;anions of I&#8722; and Cl&#8722; is proposed. The expectation is maintained that the large difference in ionic radii between them likely results in the formation of a novel compound. Consequently, Cs5Cu3Cl6I2 with a 1D zigzag chain structure is discovered. This material exhibits blue emission (&#8776;462&#160;nm) with a near&#8208;unity quantum yield of 95%. An electronic structure calculation reveals that the localized nature of the valence band maximum is crucial in obtaining efficient self&#8208;trapped exciton emission. Moreover, the iodine&#8208;bridged 1D connectivity significantly enhances the chemical stability of Cs5Cu3Cl6I2, compared with the pure chloride phase. The present findings provide a new perspective for developing air&#8208;stable alkali copper(I) halides with highly efficient luminescence.

      <title>Charging Reactions Promoted by Geometrically Necessary Dislocations in Battery Materials Revealed by In Situ Single&#8208;Particle Synchrotron Measurements</title>
      <dc:description>
Crystallographic defects are spatially identified and statistically quantified from over 10 000 Laue X&#8208;ray microdiffraction patterns in many layered oxide particles. The single&#8208;particle, multimodal synchrotron measurements reveal that particles with a higher concentration of geometrically necessary dislocations provide deeper charging reactions, indicating that dislocations may facilitate redox reactions in layered oxides.








Abstract
Crystallographic defects exist in many redox active energy materials, e.g., battery and catalyst materials, which significantly alter their chemical properties for energy storage and conversion. However, there is lack of quantitative understanding of the interrelationship between crystallographic defects and redox reactions. Herein, crystallographic defects, such as geometrically necessary dislocations, are reported to influence the redox reactions in battery particles through single&#8208;particle, multimodal, and in situ synchrotron measurements. Through Laue X&#8208;ray microdiffraction, many crystallographic defects are spatially identified and statistically quantified from a large quantity of diffraction patterns in many layered oxide particles, including geometrically necessary dislocations, tilt boundaries, and mixed defects. The in situ and ex situ measurements, combining microdiffraction and X&#8208;ray spectroscopy imaging, reveal that LiCoO2 particles with a higher concentration of geometrically necessary dislocations provide deeper charging reactions, indicating that dislocations may facilitate redox reactions in layered oxides during initial charging. The present study illustrates that a precise control of crystallographic defects and their distribution can potentially promote and homogenize redox reactions in battery materials.

Abstract
A series of glycolated polythiophenes for use in organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) is designed and synthesized, differing in the distribution of their ethylene glycol chains that are tethered to the conjugated backbone. While side chain redistribution does not have a significant impact on the optoelectronic properties of the polymers, this molecular engineering strategy strongly impacts the water uptake achieved in the polymers. By careful optimization of the water uptake in the polymer films, OECTs with unprecedented steady&#8208;state performances in terms of [&#956;C*] and current retentions up to 98% over 700 electrochemical switching cycles are developed.

      <title>Mechanical and Tribological Performances Enhanced by Self&#8208;Assembled Structures</title>
      <dc:description>
Inspired by nacre and bones, an effective fabrication method for enhancing the mechanical and tribological performances of self&#8208;assembled structures is reported via two strategies. First, a progressive interfacial sliding resistance is thought to be a source of strength and deformation hardening. Second, regulating the building blocks with an amorphous microstructure means they are harder and tougher than those that are single crystalline.








Abstract
Taking inspiration from natural materials, composite materials can be reinforced by creating matrix architectures that can better accommodate and control internal stresses. Despite the recent success in the synthesis of artificial assemblies for local reinforcement through the introduction of oriented fibers and plates into host multilayered composites, there is a lack of fundamental understanding of the factors that determine mechanical properties. Moreover, designing building blocks and interfaces that facilitate higher resistance and energy dissipation is highly challenging. When the intrinsic material is fixed, the mechanical and tribological properties can be further adjusted. In this study, europium oxide nanosheets are arranged in interlocked&#8208;junction superstructures that resist sliding at junction points, thereby enhancing the mechanical properties of the nanosheet assemblies compared to those of the conventional face&#8208;to&#8208;face superstructures formed by parallel nanosheets. Furthermore, the crystalline origin of building blocks is revealed by demonstrating that faulty crystal nanosheets adopting an amorphous structure are different from single&#8208;crystal nanosheets, with the former exhibiting superior mechanical reinforcement and improved abrasive resistance.

      <title>The Bulk Heterojunction in Organic Photovoltaic, Photodetector, and Photocatalytic Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
The development of the bulk heterojunction, in terms of materials design, device engineering, and the underpinning physical understanding, has led to significant improvements in organic photovoltaics. Looking forward, the bulk heterojunction concept is likely to allow even greater solar cell efficiencies and interestingly, can be applied to other organic electronic applications, such as organic photodetectors and photocatalysts.








Abstract
Organic semiconductors require an energetic offset in order to photogenerate free charge carriers efficiently, owing to their inability to effectively screen charges. This is vitally important in order to achieve high power conversion efficiencies in organic solar cells. Early heterojunction&#8208;based solar cells were limited to relatively modest efficiencies (&lt;4%) owing to limitations such as poor exciton dissociation, limited photon harvesting, and high recombination losses. The development of the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) has significantly overcome these issues, resulting in dramatic improvements in organic photovoltaic performance, now exceeding 18% power conversion efficiencies. Here, the design and engineering strategies used to develop the optimal bulk heterojunction for solar&#8208;cell, photodetector, and photocatalytic applications are discussed. Additionally, the thermodynamic driving forces in the creation and stability of the bulk heterojunction are presented, along with underlying photophysics in these blends. Finally, new opportunities to apply the knowledge accrued from BHJ solar cells to generate free charges for use in promising new applications are discussed.

      <title>Van Hove Singularities: Observation of Electrically Tunable van Hove Singularities in Twisted Bilayer Graphene from NanoARPES (Adv. Mater. 31/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article number 2001656, Jyoti Katoch, S&#248;ran Ulstrup, and co&#8208;workers apply nanoscale angle&#8208;resolved photoemission (nanoARPES) to measure the superlattice van Hove singularity formed by the Dirac cones of twisted bilayer graphene. The photoemission experiment is performed on a device architecture that permits electrostatic tuning of the doping level, revealing the doping dependence of the singularity over a wide energy range.

      <title>Graphene Quantum Dots: Controllable Singlet&#8211;Triplet Energy Splitting of Graphene Quantum Dots through Oxidation: From Phosphorescence to TADF (Adv. Mater. 31/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article number 2000936, Seunghyup Yoo, Seokwoo Jeon, and co&#8208;workers introduce a novel concept for tuning singlet&#8211;triplet energy splitting of graphene quantum dots (GQDs) by oxidation control, which induces a dramatic afterglow transition from phosphorescence to thermally activated delayed fluorescence. Matrix&#8208;assisted stabilization of triplet excited states provides ultralong lifetimes to such afterglow emissions at room&#8208;temperature, which enables multilevel information security.

      <title>Thermomechanical Patterning: Thermomechanical Nanocutting of 2D Materials (Adv. Mater. 31/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
Thermomechanical patterning of 2D materials into micro/nanostructures with a resolution down to 20 nm is reported by J&#252;rgen Brugger and co&#8208;workers in article number 2001232. A heated scanning nanotip performs the patterning by a combination of heat and local pressure, thereby cleaving chemical bonds of the 2D materials, in concert with the rapid sublimation of the polymer layer underneath.

      <title>3D Bioprinting: Lipid&#8208;Bilayer&#8208;Supported 3D Printing of Human Cerebral Cortex Cells Reveals Developmental Interactions (Adv. Mater. 31/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
Current understanding of brain development, derived from suboptimal in vitro and animal models, is rudimentary. In article number 2002183, Francis G. Szele, Hagan Bayley, and co&#8208;workers introduce a means to print human neural cells in a soft, biocompatible extracellular matrix. The approach provides precise, customizable construction of natural and unnatural patterns of cells, and yields important insights into the development of the human cerebral cortex.

      <title>Chiral Microstructures: Chiral Assemblies of Laser&#8208;Printed Micropillars Directed by Asymmetrical Capillary Force (Adv. Mater. 31/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
Rationally designed artificial chiral architectures have found broad applications in various fields. In article number 2002356, Yanlei Hu, Dong Wu, and co&#8208;workers describe how highly ordered chiral microstructures can be spontaneously assembled by the meniscus&#8208;directed capillary force arising in an evaporating liquid. The chirality is facilitated by rationally breaking the intrinsic symmetry through cooperative control of the geometry and spatial topology of the pillar unit cells.

      <title>Wood and the Activity of Dead Tissue</title>
      <dc:description>
Wood is a prototypical biological material, which adapts to mechanical requirements by the structural organization of cellulose fibrils. The cellulose fiber orientation determines the response of wood to environmental changes as an active material, thereby processing information and converting energy. Some examples for the harvesting of wood activity as well as bioinspiration are discussed.








Abstract
Wood is a prototypical biological material, which adapts to mechanical requirements. The microarchitecture of cellulose fibrils determines the mechanical properties of woody materials, as well as their actuation properties, based on absorption and desorption of water. Herein it is argued that cellulose fiber orientation corresponds to an analog code that determines the response of wood to humidity as an active material. Examples for the harvesting of wood activity, as well as bioinspiration, are given.

      <title>Multiple Mechanical Gradients are Responsible for the Strong Adhesion of Spider Attachment Hair</title>
      <dc:description>
Nanostructured adhesive hair on the feet of spiders is responsible for strong adhesion, enabling the animals to walk upside down. Using scanning nanofocus X&#8208;ray scattering under force control, the mechanism of alignment and consequently intimate contact, leading to adhesion of the nanostructures to a surface, is examined. The results show excellent adaptation of the biological structures for their specific function.








Abstract
Wandering spiders climb vertically and walk upside&#8208;down on rough and smooth surfaces using a nanostructured attachment system on their feet. The spiders are assumed to adhere by intermolecular van der Waals forces between the adhesive structures and the substrate. The adhesive elements are arranged highly ordered on the hierarchically structured attachment hair (setae). While walking, it has been suggested that the spiders apply a shear force on their legs to increase friction. However, the detailed mechanical behavior of the hair's structures during attachment and detachment remains unknown. Here, gradients of the mechanical properties of the attachment hair on different length scales that have evolved to support attachment, stabilize adhesion in contact, and withstand high stress at detachment, examined by in situ experiments, are shown. Shearing helps to self&#8208;align the adhesive elements with the substrate. The study is anticipated to contribute to the development of optimized artificial dry adhesives.

      <title>On&#8208;Demand Local Modification of High&#8208;Tc Superconductivity in Few Unit&#8208;Cell Thick Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+&#948;</title>
      <dc:description>
A nondestructive method of patterning high&#8208;temperature superconductivity in few unit&#8208;cell thick Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+&#948; (BSCCO) is developed. Deposition of reactive metals like Cr or Ti on the surface of few unit&#8208;cell thick BSCCO alters the superconductivity in underlying layers by locally depleting oxygen content. Using this technique, superconductivity in BSCCO can be spatially patterned to make superconducting devices like nanowires.








Abstract
High&#8208;temperature superconductors (HTSs) are important for potential applications and for understanding the origin of strong correlations. Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+&#948; (BSCCO), a van der Waals material, offers a platform to probe the physics down to a unit&#8208;cell. Guiding the flow of electrons by patterning 2DEGS and oxide heterostructures has brought new functionality and access to new science. Similarly, modifying superconductivity in HTS locally, on a small length scale, is of immense interest for superconducting electronics. A route to modify superconductivity locally by depositing metal on the surface is reported here by transport studies on few unit&#8208;cell thick BSCCO. Deposition of chromium (Cr) on the surface over a selected area of BSCCO results in insulating behavior of the underlying region. Cr locally depletes oxygen in CuO2 planes and disrupts the superconductivity in the layers below. This technique of modifying superconductivity is suitable for making sub&#8208;micrometer superconducting wires and more complex superconducting&#160;devices.

      <dc:description>
A single&#8208;pixel RGB electrofluorochromic (EFC) device is fabricated based on proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer, with remarkable EFC properties, and a prototype of a colorful pixel&#8208;based alphanumeric display is demonstrated. The success of this new exploration provides the possibility of full&#8208;color emission in EFC devices, and widely broadens the EFC system and its applications.








Abstract
With the rapid development of human society, consumer electronics have brought marvelous changes to human daily life, but they are accompanied by the much higher demand of display quality and visual experience. Therefore, ideal conversion among the three primary colors&#8212;red (R), green (G), and blue (B)&#8212;in a single pixel has been a better way to avoid the insurmountable technical barrier of subpixel technology of modern displays. Electrofluorochromic (EFC) materials capable of a novel luminescent switching, open a powerful way to design optoelectronic devices for displays and information storage etc. Colorful EFC devices, especially emitting the ideal three primary colors without subpixel technology, have been a challenge for years. Herein, a long&#8208;awaited single&#8208;pixel device with RGB color is fabricated successfully based on proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer. The RGB EFC device exhibits outstanding EFC properties, such as low turn&#8208;on voltage (+1.0 and &#8722;1.0 V), large color gamut, and good stability (500 cycles for each color). Prototypes of colorful alphanumeric displays are well demonstrated in a facile way. The success of this new exploration of single&#8208;pixel RGB EFC device not only provides the possibility of full&#8208;color emission in EFC devices, but also will widely broaden the EFC system and their applications.

      <title>Devising Materials Manufacturing Toward Lab&#8208;to&#8208;Fab Translation of Flexible Electronics</title>
      <dc:description>
Flexible electronics have witnessed tremendous progress in academia over the past decade, but their industrial adoption lags behind. To stimulate faster lab&#8208;to&#8208;fab translation, the current status of flexible electronics is reviewed, critical challenges in materials manufacturing during lab&#8208;to&#8208;fab translation are identified, and perspectives on research and development that can expedite the translation process are proposed.








Abstract
Flexible electronics have witnessed exciting progress in academia over the past decade, but most of the research outcomes have yet to be translated into products or gain much market share. For mass production and commercialization, industrial adoption of newly developed functional materials and fabrication techniques is a prerequisite. However, due to the disparate features of academic laboratories and industrial plants, translating materials and manufacturing technologies from labs to fabs is notoriously difficult. Therefore, herein, key challenges in the materials manufacturing of flexible electronics are identified and discussed for its lab&#8208;to&#8208;fab translation, along the four stages in product manufacturing: design, materials supply, processing, and integration. Perspectives on industry&#8208;oriented strategies to overcome some of these obstacles are also proposed. Priorities for action are outlined, including standardization, iteration between basic and applied research, and adoption of smart manufacturing. With concerted efforts from academia and industry, flexible electronics will bring a bigger impact to society as promised.

      <title>Stone&#8211;Wales Defects Cause High Proton Permeability and Isotope Selectivity of Single&#8208;Layer Graphene</title>
      <dc:description>
Topological (vacancy&#8208;free) Stone&#8211;Wales defects significantly lower the penetration barrier for hydrogen through graphene: the proton flow through a seven&#8208;membered ring is a million times higher compared to a ring in the pristine honeycomb lattice, and yields an H&#8208;over&#8208;D selectivity of 7 at ambient condition. These calculated results can explain hydrogen isotope separation on defect&#8208;free graphene.








Abstract
While the isotope&#8208;dependent hydrogen permeability of graphene membranes at ambient condition has been demonstrated, the underlying mechanism has been controversially discussed during the past 5 years. The reported room&#8208;temperature proton&#8208;over&#8208;deuteron (H+&#8208;over&#8208;D+) selectivity is 10, much higher than in any competing method. Yet, it has not been understood how protons can penetrate through graphene membranes&#8212;proposed hypotheses include atomic defects and local hydrogenation. However, neither can explain both the high permeability and high selectivity of the atomically thin membranes. Here, it is confirmed that ideal graphene is quasi&#8208;impermeable to protons, yet the most common defect in sp2 carbons, the topological Stone&#8211;Wales defect, has a calculated penetration barrier below 1 eV and H+&#8208;over&#8208;D+ selectivity of &#8202;7 at room temperature and, thus, explains all experimental results on graphene membranes that are available to date. The competing explanation, local hydrogenation, which also reduces the penetration barrier, but shows significantly lower isotope selectivity, is challenged.

&lt;p&gt;Topological (vacancy&#8208;free) Stone&#8211;Wales defects significantly lower the penetration barrier for hydrogen through graphene: the proton flow through a seven&#8208;membered ring is a million times higher compared to a ring in the pristine honeycomb lattice, and yields an H&#8208;over&#8208;D selectivity of 7 at ambient condition. These calculated results can explain hydrogen isotope separation on defect&#8208;free graphene.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the isotope&#8208;dependent hydrogen permeability of graphene membranes at ambient condition has been demonstrated, the underlying mechanism has been controversially discussed during the past 5 years. The reported room&#8208;temperature proton&#8208;over&#8208;deuteron (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;over&#8208;D&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) selectivity is 10, much higher than in any competing method. Yet, it has not been understood how protons can penetrate through graphene membranes&#8212;proposed hypotheses include atomic defects and local hydrogenation. However, neither can explain both the high permeability and high selectivity of the atomically thin membranes. Here, it is confirmed that ideal graphene is quasi&#8208;impermeable to protons, yet the most common defect in sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; carbons, the topological Stone&#8211;Wales defect, has a calculated penetration barrier below 1 eV and H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;over&#8208;D&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; selectivity of &#8202;7 at room temperature and, thus, explains all experimental results on graphene membranes that are available to date. The competing explanation, local hydrogenation, which also reduces the penetration barrier, but shows significantly lower isotope selectivity, is challenged.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rational Design of Functional Peptide&#8208;Gold Hybrid Nanomaterials for Molecular Interactions</title>
      <dc:description>
In this contribution, rational designed functional peptide&#8208;gold hybrid nanomaterials are reviewed for various applications such as biosensing, targeting, imaging, and so forth, due to their specific molecular interactions. With all advantages of peptide&#8208;gold&#8208;based interactive nano&#8208;approaches, they are promising for future applications in the biomedical domain and beyond, especially in field testing.








Abstract
Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have been extensively used for decades in biosensing&#8208;related development due to outstanding optical properties. Peptides, as newly realized functional biomolecules, are promising candidates of replacing antibodies, receptors, and substrates for specific molecular interactions. Both peptides and AuNPs are robust and easily synthesized at relatively low cost. Hence, peptide&#8208;AuNP&#8208;based bio&#8208;nano&#8208;technological approaches have drawn increasing interest, especially in the field of molecular targeting, cell imaging, drug delivery, and therapy. Many excellent works in these areas have been reported: demonstrating novel ideas, exploring new targets, and facilitating advanced diagnostic and therapeutic technologies. Importantly, some of them also have been employed to address real practical problems, especially in remote and less privileged areas. This contribution focuses on the application of peptide&#8211;gold hybrid nanomaterials for various molecular interactions, especially in biosensing/diagnostics and cell targeting/imaging, as well as for the development of highly active antimicrobial/antifouling coating strategies. Rationally designed peptide&#8211;gold nanomaterials with functional properties are discussed along with future challenges and opportunities.

      <title>Effect of Adventitious Carbon on Pit Formation of Monolayer MoS2</title>
      <dc:description>
In situ environmental transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements show that pit formation by thermal oxidation is preferentially initiated at the interface between adventitious carbon (C) nanoparticles and monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), rather than only sulfur vacancies. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the C/MoS2 interface favors the sequential adsorption of oxygen atoms with facile kinetics.








Abstract
Forming pits on molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) monolayers is desirable for (opto)electrical, catalytic, and biological applications. Thermal oxidation is a potentially scalable method to generate pits on monolayer MoS2, and pits are assumed to preferentially form around undercoordinated sites, such as sulfur vacancies. However, studies on thermal oxidation of MoS2 monolayers have not considered the effect of adventitious carbon (C) that is ubiquitous and interacts with oxygen at elevated temperatures. Herein, the effect of adventitious C on the pit formation on MoS2 monolayers during thermal oxidation is studied. The in situ environmental transmission electron microscopy measurements herein show that pit formation is preferentially initiated at the interface between adventitious C nanoparticles and MoS2, rather than only sulfur vacancies. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the C/MoS2 interface favors the sequential adsorption of oxygen atoms with facile kinetics. These results illustrate the important role of adventitious C on pit formation on monolayer MoS2.

      <title>Magnetic Skyrmions in a Hall Balance with Interfacial Canted Magnetizations</title>
      <dc:description>
N&#233;el&#8208;type skyrmions at zero field and room temperature are experimentally observed using Lorentz&#8208;TEM in a Hall balance with core structure of [Co/Pt]n/NiO/[Co/Pt]n. Interfacial canted magnetizations across NiO spacer give rise to the nucleation of high&#8208;density skyrmions under pulsed current, which shows a strong dependence on interlayer exchange coupling. The Physical mechanism of the skyrmions in synthetic antiferromagnets is presented.








Abstract
Magnetic skyrmions are attracting interest as efficient information&#8208;storage devices with low energy consumption, and have been experimentally and theoretically investigated in multilayers including ferromagnets, ferrimagnets, and antiferromagnets. The 3D spin texture of skyrmions demonstrated in ferromagnetic multilayers provides a powerful pathway for understanding the stabilization of ferromagnetic skyrmions. However, the manipulation mechanism of skyrmions in antiferromagnets is still lacking. A Hall balance with a ferromagnet/insulating spacer/ferromagnet structure is considered to be a promising candidate to study skyrmions in synthetic antiferromagnets. Here, high&#8208;density N&#233;el&#8208;type skyrmions are experimentally observed at zero field and room temperature by Lorentz transmission electron microscopy in a Hall balance (core structure [Co/Pt]n/NiO/[Co/Pt]n) with interfacial canted magnetizations because of interlayer ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic coupling between top and bottom [Co/Pt]n multilayers, where the Co layers in [Co/Pt]n are always ferromagnetically coupled. Micromagnetic simulations show that the generation and density of skyrmions are strongly dependent on interlayer exchange coupling (IEC) and easy&#8208;axis orientation. Direct experimental evidence of skyrmions in synthetic antiferromagnets is provided, suggesting that the proposed approach offers a promising alternative mechanism for room&#8208;temperature spintronics.

      <title>Calendering&#8208;Compatible Macroporous Architecture for Silicon&#8211;Graphite Composite toward High&#8208;Energy Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
There is a gap between lithium&#8208;ion batteries in academia and industry, which is the lack of consideration of industrial requirements in terms of electrode conditions, such as calendering. In this work, a calendering&#8208;compatible macroporous design is presented. This unique design enables both high electrode density without any collapse of pores and an excellent energy density with good cycle life under practical conditions.








Abstract
Porous strategies based on nanoengineering successfully mitigate several problems related to volume expansion of alloying anodes. However, practical application of porous alloying anodes is challenging because of limitations such as calendering incompatibility, low mass loading, and excessive usage of nonactive materials, all of which cause a lower volumetric energy density in comparison with conventional graphite anodes. In particular, during calendering, porous structures in alloying&#8208;based composites easily collapse under high pressure, attenuating the porous characteristics. Herein, this work proposes a calendering&#8208;compatible macroporous architecture for a Si&#8211;graphite anode to maximize the volumetric energy density. The anode is composed of an elastic outermost carbon covering, a nonfilling porous structure, and a graphite core. Owing to the lubricative properties of the elastic carbon covering, the macroporous structure coated by the brittle Si nanolayer can withstand high pressure and maintain its porous architecture during electrode calendering. Scalable methods using mechanical agitation and chemical vapor deposition are adopted. The as&#8208;prepared composite exhibits excellent electrochemical stability of &gt;3.6 mAh cm&#8722;2, with mitigated electrode expansion. Furthermore, full&#8208;cell evaluation shows that the composite achieves higher energy density (932 Wh L&#8722;1) and higher specific energy (333 Wh kg&#8722;1) with stable cycling than has been reported in previous studies.

      <title>Spin&#8208;Orbit Torque Magnetization Switching in MoTe2/Permalloy Heterostructures</title>
      <dc:description>
Realizing efficient spin&#8208;orbit&#8208;based switching requires the harnessing of both new materials and physics to obtain high charge&#8208;to&#8208;spin conversion efficiencies. The observation of spin&#8208;orbit torque switching in bilayers consisting of a semimetallic film of 1T&#8242;&#8208;MoTe2 adjacent to permalloy is reported. Deterministic switching is achieved without external magnetic fields at room temperature with currents one order of magnitude smaller than those using heavy metals.








Abstract
The ability to switch magnetic elements by spin&#8208;orbit&#8208;induced torques has recently attracted much attention for a path toward high&#8208;performance, nonvolatile memories with low power consumption. Realizing efficient spin&#8208;orbit&#8208;based switching requires the harnessing of both new materials and novel physics to obtain high charge&#8208;to&#8208;spin conversion efficiencies, thus making the choice of spin source crucial. Here, the observation of spin&#8208;orbit torque switching in bilayers consisting of a semimetallic film of 1T&#8242;&#8208;MoTe2 adjacent to permalloy is reported. Deterministic switching is achieved without external magnetic fields at room temperature, and the switching occurs with currents one order of magnitude smaller than those typical in devices using the best&#8208;performing heavy metals. The thickness&#8208;dependence can be understood if the interfacial spin&#8208;orbit contribution is considered in addition to the bulk spin Hall effect. Further threefold reduction in the switching current is demonstrated with resort to dumbbell&#8208;shaped magnetic elements. These findings foretell exciting prospects of using MoTe2 for low&#8208;power semimetal&#8208;material&#8208;based spin devices.

     alt="Spin&#8208;Orbit Torque Magnetization Switching in MoTe2/Permalloy Heterostructures"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realizing efficient spin&#8208;orbit&#8208;based switching requires the harnessing of both new materials and physics to obtain high charge&#8208;to&#8208;spin conversion efficiencies. The observation of spin&#8208;orbit torque switching in bilayers consisting of a semimetallic film of 1T&#8242;&#8208;MoTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adjacent to permalloy is reported. Deterministic switching is achieved without external magnetic fields at room temperature with currents one order of magnitude smaller than those using heavy metals.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability to switch magnetic elements by spin&#8208;orbit&#8208;induced torques has recently attracted much attention for a path toward high&#8208;performance, nonvolatile memories with low power consumption. Realizing efficient spin&#8208;orbit&#8208;based switching requires the harnessing of both new materials and novel physics to obtain high charge&#8208;to&#8208;spin conversion efficiencies, thus making the choice of spin source crucial. Here, the observation of spin&#8208;orbit torque switching in bilayers consisting of a semimetallic film of 1T&#8242;&#8208;MoTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adjacent to permalloy is reported. Deterministic switching is achieved without external magnetic fields at room temperature, and the switching occurs with currents one order of magnitude smaller than those typical in devices using the best&#8208;performing heavy metals. The thickness&#8208;dependence can be understood if the interfacial spin&#8208;orbit contribution is considered in addition to the bulk spin Hall effect. Further threefold reduction in the switching current is demonstrated with resort to dumbbell&#8208;shaped magnetic elements. These findings foretell exciting prospects of using MoTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for low&#8208;power semimetal&#8208;material&#8208;based spin devices.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Autonomous Surface Reconciliation of a Liquid&#8208;Metal Conductor Micropatterned on a Deformable Hydrogel</title>
      <dc:description>
Micropatternable, super&#8208;stretchable, self&#8208;healable, and water&#8208;swellable liquid&#8208;metal electrodes are developed with a low resistance of &#8776;2 and &#8776;4.6 &#937; at strains of 0% and 1500%, respectively, with low variation in conductance (a variation factor of &#8776;2.3) by utilizing autonomous surface reconciliation of EGaIn on chemically modified hydrogels. These electrodes are suitable for a variety of deformable microelectronic applications.








Abstract
Spreading liquid droplets on solid surfaces is a core topic in physical chemistry with significant technological implications. Liquid metals, which are eutectic alloys of constituent metal atoms with low melting temperatures, are practically useful, but difficult to spread on solid surfaces because of their high surface tension. This makes it difficult to use liquid metals as deformable on&#8208;board microcircuitry electrodes, despite their intrinsic deformability. In this study, it is discovered that eutectic gallium&#8211;indium (EGaIn) can be spread onto the surface of chemically cross&#8208;linked hydrogels consisting of aliphatic alkyl chains with numerous hydroxyl groups (&#63743;OH), thus facilitating the development of directly micropatterned EGaIn electrodes. More importantly, EGaIn patterned on a hydrogel autonomously reconciliates its surface to form a firm hydrogel interface upon mechanical deformation of the hydrogel. This autonomous surface reconciliation of EGaIn on hydrogels allows researchers to reap the benefits of chemically modified hydrogels, such as reversible stretching, self&#8208;healing, and water&#8208;swelling capability, thereby facilitating the fabrication of superstretchable, self&#8208;healable, and water&#8208;swellable liquid&#8208;metal electrodes with very high conductance tolerance upon deformation. Such electrodes are suitable for a variety of deformable microelectronic applications.

      <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Colossal Magnetoresistance in Terraced Single&#8208;Layer Graphene</title>
      <dc:description>
Terraced graphene, formed by laminating single&#8208;layer graphene on a terraced substrate, shows a colossal magnetoresistance of up to 5000% at 9 T and 300&#160;K. The magnetoresistance enhancement is attributed to the topographic corrugations and inhomogeneous charge puddles induced by the terraced structure. The concept of inducing colossal magnetoresistance by stepped surfaces is certainly boosting room&#8208;temperature graphene magnetic sensors.








Abstract
Disorder&#8208;induced magnetoresistance (MR) effect is quadratic at low perpendicular magnetic fields and linear at high fields. This effect is technologically appealing, especially in 2D materials such as graphene, since it offers potential applications in magnetic sensors with nanoscale spatial resolution. However, it is a great challenge to realize a graphene magnetic sensor based on this effect because of the difficulty in controlling the spatial distribution of disorder and enhancing the MR sensitivity in the single&#8208;layer regime. Here, a room&#8208;temperature colossal MR of up to 5000% at 9 T is reported in terraced single&#8208;layer graphene. By laminating single&#8208;layer graphene on a terraced substrate, such as TiO2&#8208;terminated SrTiO3, a universal one order of magnitude enhancement in the MR compared to conventional single&#8208;layer graphene devices is demonstrated. Strikingly, a colossal MR of &gt;1000% is also achieved in the terraced graphene even at a high carrier density of &#8776;1012 cm&#8722;2. Systematic studies of the MR of single&#8208;layer graphene on various oxide&#8208; and non&#8208;oxide&#8208;based terraced surfaces demonstrate that the terraced structure is the dominant factor driving the MR enhancement. The results open a new route for tailoring the physical property of 2D materials by engineering the strain through a terraced substrate.

      <title>Tocilizumab&#8208;Conjugated Polymer Nanoparticles for NIR&#8208;II Photoacoustic&#8208;Imaging&#8208;Guided Therapy of Rheumatoid Arthritis</title>
      <dc:description>
The US Food and Drug Administration approved antirheumatic targeted drug tocilizumab (TCZ) is conjugated to polymer nanoparticles (PNPs) to develop TCZ&#8208;PNPs for near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;II photoacoustic (PA) imaging&#8208;guided therapy of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). TCZ&#8208;PNPs&#8208;assisted NIR&#8208;II PA molecular imaging shows that TCZ&#8208;PNPs have excellent RA specificity and significant suppression effect, which provides a new strategy for RA theranostics and therapeutic monitoring.








Abstract
The progressive debilitating nature of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) combined with its unknown etiology and initial similarity to other inflammatory diseases makes early diagnosis a significant challenge. Early recognition and treatment of RA is essential for achieving effective therapeutic outcome. NIR&#8208;II photoacoustic (PA) molecular imaging (PMI) is emerging as a promising new strategy for effective diagnosis and treatment guidance of RA, owing to its high sensitivity and specificity at large penetration depth. Herein, an antirheumatic targeted drug tocilizumab (TCZ) is conjugated to polymer nanoparticles (PNPs) to develop the first NIR&#8208;II theranostic nanoplatform, named TCZ&#8208;PNPs, for PA&#8208;imaging&#8208;guided therapy of RA. The TCZ&#8208;PNPs are demonstrated to have strong NIR&#8208;II extinction coefficient, high photostability and excellent biocompatibility. NIR&#8208;II PMI results reveal the excellent targeting abilities of TCZ&#8208;PNPs for the effective noninvasive diagnosis of RA joint tissue with a high signal&#8208;to noise ratio (SNR) of 35.8 dB in 3D PA tomography images. Remarkably, one&#8208;month treatment and PA monitoring using TCZ&#8208;PNPs shows RA is significantly suppressed. In addition, the therapeutic evaluation of RA mice by NIR&#8208;II PMI is shown to be consistent with clinical micro&#8208;CT and histological analysis. The TCZ&#8208;PNPs&#8208;assisted NIR&#8208;II PMI provides a new strategy for RA theranostics, therapeutic monitoring and the beyond.

      <title>A Moisture&#8208;Hungry Copper Complex Harvesting Air Moisture for Potable Water and Autonomous Urban Agriculture</title>
      <dc:description>
A moisture&#8208;hungry Cu&#8208;complex is synthesized and used for fabricating a SmartFarm device that can harvest atmospheric water during the nighttime and release water during the daytime under natural sunlight. The device enables self&#8208;sustainable and autonomous irrigation to alleviate both water and food scarcity.








Abstract
The earth's atmosphere houses an enormous amount of water, which could be effectively exploited for a plethora of applications. While the development of materials for harnessing this abundant resource has gained impetus in recent years, limited efforts have been devoted to in&#8208;depth research on their agricultural applications. Herein, a novel copper(II)&#8211;ethanolamine complex (Cu&#8208;complex), which has a maximum water uptake of up to 300% and a water production rate of 2.24 g g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 under natural sunlight, is reported. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application, using this material, a fully automated and self&#8208;sustainable solar&#8208;powered SmartFarm device is developed. The Cu&#8208;complex harvests atmospheric water during the night, stores the adsorbed water within, and efficiently releases the adsorbed water during the day when the device is exposed to sunlight. The water harvesting and irrigation process can be fine&#8208;tuned to suit different types of plants and local climates for an optimal cultivation. With the SmartFarm in operation, the demand for freshwater for irrigation could be greatly reduced and urban farming techniques such as large&#8208;scale rooftop farming could be promoted with a view of alleviating both water and food scarcity in the near future.

      <title>Chiral Transition Metal Oxides: Synthesis, Chiral Origins, and Perspectives</title>
      <dc:description>
Transition metal oxides with induced chirality have revolutionized the area of chiroptics and motifs of fundamental research on chiral origin of inorganic nanomaterials with chiral morphologies or chiral interactions with the environment, demonstrating capacities of such unique classes of nano&#8208; to microscale materials for the applications in environmental remediation, stereoselective synthesis, and biological science.








Abstract
Transition metal oxides (TMOs) consist of a series of solid materials, exhibiting a wide variety of structures with tunability and versatile physicochemical properties.

&lt;p&gt;Transition metal oxides with induced chirality have revolutionized the area of chiroptics and motifs of fundamental research on chiral origin of inorganic nanomaterials with chiral morphologies or chiral interactions with the environment, demonstrating capacities of such unique classes of nano&#8208; to microscale materials for the applications in environmental remediation, stereoselective synthesis, and biological science.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transition metal oxides (TMOs) consist of a series of solid materials, exhibiting a wide variety of structures with tunability and versatile physicochemical properties. Such a statement is undeniably true for chiral TMOs since the introduction of chirality brings in not only active optical activities but also geometrical anisotropy due to the symmetry&#8208;breaking effect. Although progressive investigations have been made for accurately controlled synthesis and relevant explanations on the chirality origin of such materials, the overall field of chiral TMOs is still in its infancy with adequate space for interdisciplinary communications and development.

      <title>Aggregate Science: From Structures to Properties</title>
      <dc:description>
The study of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) creates many aggregate&#8208;related research branches in which the structures and properties are quite different from those of their molecular components. By virtue of the emerging AIE research, the concept of &#8220;aggregate science&#8221; is proposed to fill the gap between molecules and aggregates, meanwhile providing a general platform for academic research at the mesoscale.








Abstract
Molecular science entails the study of structures and properties of materials at the level of single molecules or small interacting complexes of molecules. Moving beyond single molecules and well&#8208;defined complexes, aggregates (i.e., irregular clusters of many molecules) serve as a particularly useful form of materials that often display modified or wholly new properties compared to their molecular components. Some unique structures and phenomena such as polymorphic aggregates, aggregation&#8208;induced symmetry breaking, and cluster excitons are only identified in aggregates, as a few examples of their exotic features. Here, by virtue of the flourishing research on aggregation&#8208;induced emission, the concept of &#8220;aggregate science&#8221; is put forward to fill the gaps between molecules and aggregates. Structures and properties on the aggregate scale are also systematically summarized. The structure&#8211;property relationships established for aggregates are expected to contribute to new materials and technological development. Ultimately, aggregate science may become an interdisciplinary research field and serves as a general platform for academic research.

      <title>Thiol&#8208;Branched Solid Polymer Electrolyte Featuring High Strength, Toughness, and Lithium Ionic Conductivity for Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
A thiol&#8208;branched SPE is synthesized to decouple ionic conductivity and mechanic strength and it features high mechanical strength, toughness, and ionic conductivity. Meanwhile, the SPE is also endowed with the functions of both enabling fast Li+ transport and blocking Li dendrite growth, thereby guaranteeing a high stability in battery cycling.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) with high energy densities are highly desirable for energy storage, but generally suffer from dendrite growth and side reactions in liquid electrolytes; thus the need for solid electrolytes with high mechanical strength, ionic conductivity, and compatible interface arises. Herein, a thiol&#8208;branched solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) is introduced featuring high Li+ conductivity (2.26 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 at room temperature) and good mechanical strength (9.4 MPa)/toughness (&#8776;500%), thus unblocking the tradeoff between ionic conductivity and mechanical robustness in polymer electrolytes. The SPE (denoted as M&#8208;S&#8208;PEGDA) is fabricated by covalently cross&#8208;linking metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), tetrakis (3&#8208;mercaptopropionic acid) pentaerythritol (PETMP), and poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) via multiple C&#63743;S&#63743;C bonds. The SPE also exhibits a high electrochemical window (&gt;5.4 V), low interfacial impedance (&lt;550 &#937;), and impressive Li+ transference number (tLi+ = 0.44). As a result, Li||Li symmetrical cells with the thiol&#8208;branched SPE displayed a high stability in a &gt;1300 h cycling test. Moreover, a Li|M&#8208;S&#8208;PEGDA|LiFePO4 full cell demonstrates discharge capacity of 143.7 mAh g&#8722;1 and maintains 85.6% after 500 cycles at 0.5 C, displaying one of the most outstanding performances for SPEs to date.

      <title>Emergent Nonreciprocal Circularly Polarized Emission from an Organic Thin Film</title>
      <dc:description>
The thin film of a chiral &#960;&#8208;conjugated phenylene derivative emits circularly polarized (CP) light with a high degree of dissymmetry and opposite handedness from the two opposite faces of the film. Nonreciprocal CP emission is unreported so far, and it offers new opportunities in the design of CP emitting materials.








Abstract
Controlling circularly polarized (CP) emission is key for both fundamental understanding and applications in the field of chiral photonics and electronics. Here, a completely new way to achieve this goal is presented. A luminescent thin film, made from a chiral conjugated phenylene bis&#8208;thiophenylpropynone able to self&#8208;assemble into ordered structures, emits highly circularly polarized light with opposite handedness from its two opposite faces. Such emergent nonreciprocal behavior in CP emission, so far unprecedented, represents a fundamental advance, opening new opportunities in design, preparation, and applications of CP emitting materials.

      <title>Large Switchable Photoconduction within 2D Potential Well of a Layered Ferroelectric Heterostructure</title>
      <dc:description>
Coexistence of a 2D potential well and robust ferroelectric polarization is achieved in layered&#8208;perovskite Bi2WO6, leading to a large and stable photocurrent density in an artificially designed photosensitive Bi2WO6/SrTiO3 heterostructure. Such a prototype device shows a great potential for applications in high&#8208;efficiency photovoltaic cells and nonvolatile information processing with low power consumption.








Abstract
The coexistence of large conductivity and robust ferroelectricity is promising for high&#8208;performance ferroelectric devices based on polarization&#8208;controllable highly efficient carrier transport. Distinct from traditional perovskite ferroelectrics, Bi2WO6 with a layered structure shows a great potential to preserve its ferroelectricity under substantial electron doping. Herein, by artificial design of photosensitive heterostructures with desired band alignment, three orders of magnitude enhancement of the short&#8208;circuit photocurrent is achieved in Bi2WO6/SrTiO3 at room temperature. The microscopic mechanism of this large photocurrent originates from separated transport of electrons and holes in [WO4]&#8722;2 and [Bi2O2]+2 layers respectively with a large in&#8208;plane conductivity, which is understood by a combination of ab initio calculations and spectroscopic measurements. The layered electronic structure and appropriately designed band alignment in this layered ferroelectric heterostructure provide an opportunity to achieve high&#8208;performance and nonvolatile switchable electronic devices.

      <dc:description>
DNA micro&#8208;disks, QR&#8208;coded micro&#8208;sized disks that harbor data&#8208;encoded DNA molecules for the efficient management of DNA&#8208;based data storage are proposed. Using these DNA micro&#8208;disks, data items can be efficiently accessed by indexing the data&#8208;encoded DNA library and write&#8208;once&#8211;read&#8208;many (WORM) memory can be demonstrated through in situ DNA production on the DNA micro&#8208;disks.








Abstract
DNA&#8208;based data storage has attracted attention because of its higher physical density of the data and longer retention time than those of conventional digital data storage. However, previous DNA&#8208;based data storage lacked index features and the data quality of storage after a single access was not preserved, obstructing its industrial use. Here, DNA micro&#8208;disks, QR&#8208;coded micro&#8208;sized disks that harbor data&#8208;encoded DNA molecules for the efficient management of DNA&#8208;based data storage, are proposed. The two major features that previous DNA&#8208;based data&#8208;storage studies could not achieve are demonstrated. One feature is accessing data items efficiently by indexing the data&#8208;encoded DNA library. Another is achieving write&#8208;once&#8211;read&#8208;many (WORM) memory through the immobilization of DNA molecules on the disk and their enrichment through in situ DNA production. Through these features, the reliability of DNA&#8208;based data storage is increased by allowing selective and multiple accession of data&#8208;encoded DNA with lower data loss than previous DNA&#8208;based data storage methods.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DNA&#8208;based data storage has attracted attention because of its higher physical density of the data and longer retention time than those of conventional digital data storage. However, previous DNA&#8208;based data storage lacked index features and the data quality of storage after a single access was not preserved, obstructing its industrial use. Here, DNA micro&#8208;disks, QR&#8208;coded micro&#8208;sized disks that harbor data&#8208;encoded DNA molecules for the efficient management of DNA&#8208;based data storage, are proposed. The two major features that previous DNA&#8208;based data&#8208;storage studies could not achieve are demonstrated. One feature is accessing data items efficiently by indexing the data&#8208;encoded DNA library. Another is achieving write&#8208;once&#8211;read&#8208;many (WORM) memory through the immobilization of DNA molecules on the disk and their enrichment through in situ DNA production. Through these features, the reliability of DNA&#8208;based data storage is increased by allowing selective and multiple accession of data&#8208;encoded DNA with lower data loss than previous DNA&#8208;based data storage methods.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Advanced Nanowood Materials for the Water&#8211;Energy Nexus</title>
      <dc:description>
A state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art review on novel nanowood materials and applications related to the water&#8211;energy nexus is presented. The unique structures and properties are highlighted, and how such features are harnessed by nanomanufacturing to enable sustainable water filtration, adsorption, catalysis, energy and resource recovery, as well as desalination and environmental cleanup, is discussed. Insights are offered on future development to enable a circular water economy.








Abstract
Wood materials are being reinvented to carry superior properties for a variety of new applications. Cutting&#8208;edge nanomanufacturing transforms traditional bulky and low&#8208;value woods into advanced materials that have desired structures, durability, and functions to replace nonrenewable plastics, polymers, and metals. Here, a first prospect report on how novel nanowood materials have been developed and applied in water and associated industries is provided, wherein their unique features and promises are discussed. First, the unique hierarchical structure and associated properties of the material are introduced, and then how such features can be harnessed and modified by either bottom&#8208;up or top&#8208;down manufacturing to enable different functions for water filtration, chemical adsorption and catalysis, energy and resource recovery, as well as energy&#8208;efficient desalination and environmental cleanup are discussed. The study recognizes that this is a nascent but very promising field; therefore, insights are offered to encourage more research and development. Trees harness solar energy and CO2 and provide abundant carbon&#8208;negative materials. Once harvested and utilized, it is believed that advanced wood materials will play a vital role in enabling a circular water economy.

      <title>Structure&#8211;Transport Correlation Reveals Anisotropic Charge Transport in Coupled PbS Nanocrystal Superlattices</title>
      <dc:description>
Nanocrystal superlattices exhibit favored directions for charge transport. Electronic and structural properties of microdomains of coupled PbS nanocrystal superlattices are correlatively investigated by conductivity and X&#8208;ray nanodiffraction measurements. Highly ordered superlattices of iso&#8208;oriented nanocrystals show electrical transport anisotropy, a feature attractive for electronic applications, which has never been experimentally demonstrated for nanocrystal superlattices before.








Abstract
The assembly of colloidal semiconductive nanocrystals into highly ordered superlattices predicts novel structure&#8208;related properties by design. However, those structure&#8211;property relationships, such as charge transport depending on the structure or even directions of the superlattice, have remained unrevealed so far. Here, electric transport measurements and X&#8208;ray nanodiffraction are performed on self&#8208;assembled lead sulfide nanocrystal superlattices to investigate direction&#8208;dependent charge carrier transport in microscopic domains of these materials. By angular X&#8208;ray cross&#8208;correlation analysis, the structure and orientation of individual superlattices is determined, which are directly correlated with the electronic properties of the same microdomains. By that, strong evidence for the effect of superlattice crystallinity on the electric conductivity is found. Further, anisotropic charge transport in highly ordered monocrystalline domains is revealed, which is attributed to the dominant effect of shortest interparticle distance. This implies that transport anisotropy should be a general feature of weakly coupled nanocrystal superlattices.

      <title>Electrochemical Intercalation in Atomically Thin van der Waals Materials for Structural Phase Transition and Device Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
Recent progress on the electrochemical intercalation of foreign species into atomically thin 2D materials and van der Waals heterostructures via versatile electrochemical platforms and their influence on the structural phase transition of materials and novel device applications is reviewed, and the future opportunities especially on the intercalation via solid ion conductor field effect transistors are discussed.








Abstract
In van der Waals (vdWs) materials and heterostructures, the interlayers are bonded by weak vdWs interactions due to the lack of dangling bonds. The vdWs gap at the homo&#8208; or heterointerface provides great freedom to enrich the tunability of electronic structures by external intercalation of foreign ions or atoms at the interface, leading to the discovery of new physics and functionalities. Herein, the recent progress on electrochemical intercalation of foreign species into atomically thin vdWs materials for structural phase transition and device applications is reviewed and future opportunities are discussed. First, several kinds of electrochemical intercalation platforms to achieve the intercalation in vdWs materials and heterostructures are introduced. Next, the in situ characterization of electrochemical intercalation dynamics by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art techniques is summarized, including optical techniques, scanning probe techniques, and electrical transport. Moreover, particular attention is paid on the experimentally reported phase transition and multifunctional applications of intercalated devices. Finally, future applications and challenges of intercalation in vdWs materials and heterostructures are proposed, including the intrinsic intercalation mechanism of solid ion conductors, exact identification of intercalated foreign species by near&#8208;field optical techniques, and the tunability of intercalation kinetics for ultrafast switching.
