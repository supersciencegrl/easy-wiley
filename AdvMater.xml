         <title>Solvent&#8208;Assisted 4D Programming and Reprogramming of Liquid Crystalline Organo&#8208;gels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Encoding molecular ordering during liquid crystalline network (LCN) formation endows preprogrammed but fixed shape morphing in response to external stimuli. The incorporation of dynamic covalent bonds enables shape reprogramming but also permanently alters the network structures. Here, an entropic approach that can program complex shapes via directed solvent evaporation from an isotropic LCN organo&#8208;gel is discoursed. Different shapes can be erased and reprogrammed from the same LCN on demand depending on the modes of deformation of the organo&#8208;gel during solvent evaporation. The ability to decouple network synthesis and molecular alignment relaxes the requirements to LCN chemistry and alignment methods, allowing for the realization of a variety of origami/kirigami structures and 4D shape morphing of LCNs printed from the digital light processing technique with unattainable spatial and temporal controls.

         <title>Intrinsic Wettability in Pristine Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The wettability of graphene remains controversial owing to its high sensitivity to the surroundings, which is reflected by the wide range of reported water contact angle (WCA). Specifically, the surface contamination and underlying substrate would strongly alter the intrinsic wettability of graphene. Here, we investigate the intrinsic wettability of graphene by measuring WCA on suspended, superclean graphene membrane using environmental scanning electron microscope. An extremely low WCA with an average value &#8764; 30o was observed, confirming the hydrophilic nature of pristine graphene. This high hydrophilicity originates from the charge transfer between graphene and water molecules through H&#8208;&#960; interaction. Our work provides a deep understanding of the water&#8208;graphene interaction and opens up a new way for measuring the surface properties of 2D materials.

         <title>Scalable Polyimide&#8208;poly(Amic Acid) Copolymer Based Nanocomposites for High&#8208;Temperature Capacitive Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
The developments of next&#8208;generation electric power systems and electronics demand for high temperature (&#8764;150&#176;C), high energy density, high efficiency, scalable and low&#8208;cost polymer&#8208;based dielectric capacitors which are still scarce. Here, the nanocomposites based on polyimide&#8208;poly(amic acid) copolymers with a very low amount of boron nitride nanosheets are designed and synthesized. Under the actual working condition in hybrid electric vehicles of 200 MV m&#8211;1 and 150&#176;C, a high energy density of 1.38 J cm&#8211;3 with an efficiency of higher than 96% is achieved. This is about 2.5 times higher than the room temperature energy density (&#8764;0.39 J cm&#8211;3 under 200 MV m&#8211;1) of the commercially used biaxially oriented polypropylene, the benchmark of dielectric polymer. Especially, the energy density and efficiency at 150&#176;C show no sign of degradation after 20000 cycles of charge&#8208;discharge test and 35 days&#8217; high&#8208;temperature endurance test. This research provides an effective and low&#8208;cost strategy to develop high&#8208;temperature polymer&#8208;based capacitors.

         <title>Highly Efficient Blue Phosphorescence from Pillar&#8208;Layer MOFs by Ligand Functionalization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) has been extensively researched in heavy&#8208;metal containing complexes and purely organic system. Despite the rapid blossom of RTP materials, it is still a tremendous challenge to develop highly efficient blue RTP materials with long&#8208;lived lifetimes. Taking the metal organic framework (MOF) as a model, we herein propose a feasible strategy of ligand functionalization, including two essential elements, to develop blue phosphorescence materials with high efficiency and long&#8208;lived lifetimes simultaneously under ambient conditions. One is isolation of the chromophores with assistance of another predefined co&#8208;ligands, the other is restriction of the chromophores&#8217; motions through coordination and host&#8208;guest interactions. Remarkably, it renders the MOFs with high efficient blue phosphorescence up to 80.6% and a lifetime of 169.7&#160;ms under ambient conditions. Moreover, a demo of the crown is fabricated with MOFs ink by 3D printing technique. The potential applications for anti&#8208;counterfeiting and fingerprint visualization were also demonstrated. This finding not only outlines a universal principle to design and synthesize highly efficient RTP materials, but also endows traditional MOFs with fresh vitality for potential applications.

Phototransistors
Metal&#8211;oxide&#8208;based phototransistors conventionally have a limit to their detection range and display a persistent photocurrent (PPC) phenomenon, which may hinder their potential applications in devices. In article number 2006091, Hyun Jae Kim and co&#8208;workers review the latest approaches for the absorption layer, according to surface treatment, structural engineering, and the absorption materials. In addition, they also discuss emerging applications and a general outlook. A metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor&#8208;based phototransistor structure for light detection is depicted.

Hydrogen Sensors
In article number 2005929, Wooyoung Lee and co&#8208;workers review the progress and approaches regarding Pd&#8208;nanogap&#8208;based H2 sensors supported on elastomeric substrates, which have been achieved over the last 10 years. When exposed to H2 or the H2 removed, the sensor is in an on or off state (closed/open nanogap), respectively, because of the volume expansion/contraction of the Pd resulting from the absorbing/desorbing H atoms.

         <title>Weighted Mobility Ratio Engineering for High&#8208;Performance Bi&#8211;Te&#8208;Based Thermoelectric Materials via Suppression of Minority Carrier Transport</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 47, November 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Suppression of the bipolar conduction in narrow&#8208;bandgap thermoelectric materials is crucial for improving their device efficiency. This work correlates the weighted mobility ratio in thermoelectric figure of merit and bipolar conduction in bismuth&#8208;telluride&#8208;based alloys. The results suggest that increasing the weighted mobility ratio suppresses the bipolar conduction most effectively among other parameters like carrier concentration and bandgap.








Abstract
Thermoelectrics, which can generate electricity from a temperature difference, or vice versa, is a key technology for solid&#8208;state cooling and energy harvesting; however, its applications are constrained owing to low efficiency. Since the conversion efficiency of thermoelectric devices is directly obtained via a figure of merit of materials, zT, which is related to the electronic and thermal transport characteristics, the aim here is to elucidate physical parameters that should be considered to understand transport phenomena in semiconducting materials. It is found that the weighted mobility ratio of the majority and minority carrier bands is an important parameter that determines zT. For nanograined Bi&#8211;Sb&#8211;Te alloy, the unremarked role of this parameter on temperature&#8208;dependent electronic transport properties is demonstrated. This analysis shows that the control of the weighted mobility ratio is a promising way to enhance zT of narrow bandgap thermoelectric materials.

         <title>Structuring of Si into Multiple Scales by Metal&#8208;Assisted Chemical Etching</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 47, November 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;assisted chemical etching (MaCE) is a versatile method for the facile fabrication of Si and other semiconductors into structures having widely different scales. The recent advances in MaCE are introduced, with special emphasis on the macroscale structuring of Si and its applications to a variety of fields, such as microelectromechanical systems, microfluidics, and micro&#8208;total analysis systems.








Abstract
Structuring Si, ranging from nanoscale to macroscale feature dimensions, is essential for many applications. Metal&#8208;assisted chemical etching (MaCE) has been developed as a simple, low&#8208;cost, and scalable method to produce structures across widely different dimensions. The process involves various parameters, such as catalyst, substrate doping type and level, crystallography, etchant formulation, and etch additives. Careful optimization of these parameters is the key to the successful fabrication of Si structures. In this review, recent additions to the MaCE process are presented after a brief introduction to the fundamental principles involved in MaCE. In particular, the bulk&#8208;scale structuring of Si by MaCE is summarized and critically discussed with application examples. Various approaches for effective mass transport schemes are introduced and discussed. Further, the fine control of etch directionality and uniformity, and the suppression of unwanted side etching are also discussed. Known application examples of Si macrostructures fabricated by MaCE, though limited thus far, are presented. There are significant opportunities for the application of macroscale Si structures in different fields, such as microfluidics, micro&#8208;total analysis systems, and microelectromechanical systems, etc. Thus more research is necessary on macroscale MaCE of Si and their applications.

         <title>Electronic Drugs: Spatial and Temporal Medical Treatment of Human Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 47, November 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electronic drugs (e&#8208;drugs) for spatial and temporal medical treatment of human diseases are of great importance for the development of advanced biomedical integrated devices to solve unmet medical challenges. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art advances in e&#8208;drugs are systematically introduced in terms of their device types and targeting diseases. An outlook and the challenges for future research are also provided.








Abstract
Recent advances in diagnostics and medicines emphasize the spatial and temporal aspects of monitoring and treating diseases. However, conventional therapeutics, including oral administration and injection, have difficulties meeting these aspects due to physiological and technological limitations, such as long&#8208;term implantation and a narrow therapeutic window. As an innovative approach to overcome these limitations, electronic devices known as electronic drugs (e&#8208;drugs) have been developed to monitor real&#8208;time body signals and deliver specific treatments to targeted tissues or organs. For example, ingestible and patch&#8208;type e&#8208;drugs could detect changes in biomarkers at the target sites, including the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and the skin, and deliver therapeutics to enhance healing in a spatiotemporal manner. However, medical treatments often require invasive surgical procedures and implantation of medical equipment for either short or long&#8208;term use. Therefore, approaches that could minimize implantation&#8208;associated side effects, such as inflammation and scar tissue formation, while maintaining high functionality of e&#8208;drugs, are highly needed. Herein, the importance of the spatial and temporal aspects of medical treatment is thoroughly reviewed along with how e&#8208;drugs use cutting&#8208;edge technological innovations to deal with unresolved medical challenges. Furthermore, diverse uses of e&#8208;drugs in clinical applications and the future perspectives of e&#8208;drugs are discussed.

         <dc:description>
The increasing interest in novel materials requires in&#8208;depth research on its mechanisms, structural analyses, characterization, and potential applications. The comprehensive progress of novel layered compounds synthesized via topochemical approaches is analyzed. Along with its current status from the existing literature, future research directions to address their challenges and unveil their potential are also discussed.








Abstract
The designing of novel materials is a fascinating and innovative pathway in materials science. Particularly, novel layered compounds have tremendous influence in various research fields. Advanced fundamental studies covering various aspects, including reactants and synthetic methods, are required to obtain novel layered materials with unique physical and chemical properties. Among the promising synthetic techniques, topochemical approaches have afforded the platform for widening the extent of novel 2D materials. Notably, the synthesis of binary layered materials is considered as a major scientific breakthrough after the synthesis of graphene as they exhibit a wide spectrum of material properties with varied potential applicability. In this review, a comprehensive overview of the progress in the development of metastable layered compounds is presented. The various metastable layered compounds synthesized from layered ternary bulk materials through topochemical approaches are listed, followed by the descriptions of their mechanisms, structural analyses, characterizations, and potential applications. Finally, an essential research direction concerning the synthesis of new materials is indicated, wherein the possible application of topochemical approaches in unprecedented areas is explored.

Notably, the synthesis of binary layered materials is considered as a major scientific breakthrough after the synthesis of graphene as they exhibit a wide spectrum of material properties with varied potential applicability. In this review, a comprehensive overview of the progress in the development of metastable layered compounds is presented. The various metastable layered compounds synthesized from layered ternary bulk materials through topochemical approaches are listed, followed by the descriptions of their mechanisms, structural analyses, characterizations, and potential applications. Finally, an essential research direction concerning the synthesis of new materials is indicated, wherein the possible application of topochemical approaches in unprecedented areas is explored.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Layer&#8208;Deposition&#8208;Based 2D Transition Metal Chalcogenides: Synthesis, Modulation, and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 47, November 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An overview of the synthesis of 2D transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) by atomic layer deposition (ALD) is presented. While the ALD of thin films on 2D TMCs can modify the TMC properties, that of low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials on 2D TMCs can enhance the device performance. The characteristics of ALD&#8208;based TMCs applied to nanoelectronics, sensors, and energy applications are discussed.








Abstract
Transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) are a large family of 2D materials with different properties, and are promising candidates for a wide range of applications such as nanoelectronics, sensors, energy conversion, and energy storage. In the research of new materials, the development and investigation of industry&#8208;compatible synthesis techniques is of key importance. In this respect, it is important to study 2D TMC materials synthesized by the atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique, which is widely applied in industries. In addition to the synthesis of 2D TMCs, ALD is used to modulate the characteristic of 2D TMCs such as their carrier density and morphology. So far, the improvement of thin film uniformity without oxidation and the synthesis of low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials on 2D TMCs have been the research focus. Herein, the synthesis and modulation of 2D TMCs by ALD is described, and the characteristics of ALD&#8208;based TMCs used in nanoelectronics, sensors, and energy applications are discussed.

         <title>3D Electrodes for Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 47, November 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent remarkable advances of 3D electrodes for bioelectronics are discussed, with extra emphasis on various materials and fabrication processes for 3D electrodes as well as biomedical applications, such as microelectrode arrays, neural recoding, and retinal prostheses.








Abstract
In recent studies related to bioelectronics, significant efforts have been made to form 3D electrodes to increase the effective surface area or to optimize the transfer of signals at tissue&#8211;electrode interfaces. Although bioelectronic devices with 2D and flat electrode structures have been used extensively for monitoring biological signals, these 2D planar electrodes have made it difficult to form biocompatible and uniform interfaces with nonplanar and soft biological systems (at the cellular or tissue levels). Especially, recent biomedical applications have been expanding rapidly toward 3D organoids and the deep tissues of living animals, and 3D bioelectrodes are getting significant attention because they can reach the deep regions of various 3D tissues. An overview of recent studies on 3D bioelectronic devices, such as the use of electrical stimulations and the recording of neural signals from biological subjects, is presented. Subsequently, the recent developments in materials and fabrication processing to 3D micro&#8208; and nanostructures are introduced, followed by broad applications of these 3D bioelectronic devices at various in vitro and in vivo conditions.

Natural photosynthesis absorbs solar energy and generates photosynthetic electrons by water splitting with an internal quantum efficiency close to 100%. Various nanomaterials applied to photosynthetic complexes are discussed in detail, including the working principles and improvements in photosynthetic electron generation, transfer, conversion, and storage efficiency.








Abstract
Harvesting solar energy in the form of electricity from the photosynthesis of plants, algal cells, and bacteria has been researched as the most environment&#8208;friendly renewable energy technology in the last decade. The primary challenge has been the engineering of electrochemical interfacing with photosynthetic apparatuses, organelles, or whole cells. However, with the aid of low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials, there have been many advances, including enhanced photon absorption, increased generation of photosynthetic electrons (PEs), and more efficient transfer of PEs to electrodes. These advances have demonstrated the possibility for the technology to advance to a new level. In this article, the fundamentals of photosynthesis are introduced. How PE harvesting systems have improved concerning solar energy absorption, PE production, and PE collection by electrodes is discussed. The review focuses on how different kinds of nanomaterials are applied and function in interfacing with photosynthetic materials for enhanced PE harvesting. Finally, the review analyzes how the performance of PE harvesting and stand&#8208;alone systems have evolved so far and its future prospects.

         <title>Quantum Plasmonics: Energy Transport Through Plasmonic Gap</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 47, November 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum plasmonics is an emerging field of research on the quantum properties of surface plasmons and their control in light&#8211;matter interactions at the quantum level. The basics of quantum plasmonics and plasmonic resonators, nanoscale/sub&#8208;nanoscale fabrication approaches, advanced materials of resonant and nonresonant quantum energy transport and coupling are summarized along with their potential applications.








Abstract
At the interfaces of metal and dielectric materials, strong light&#8211;matter interactions excite surface plasmons; this allows electromagnetic field confinement and enhancement on the sub&#8208;wavelength scale. Such phenomena have attracted considerable interest in the field of exotic material&#8208;based nanophotonic research, with potential applications including nonlinear spectroscopies, information processing, single&#8208;molecule sensing, organic&#8208;molecule devices, and plasmon chemistry. These innovative plasmonics&#8208;based technologies can meet the ever&#8208;increasing demands for speed and capacity in nanoscale devices, offering ultrasensitive detection capabilities and low&#8208;power operations. Size scaling from the nanometer to sub&#8208;nanometer ranges is consistently researched; as a result, the quantum behavior of localized surface plasmons, as well as those of matter, nonlocality, and quantum electron tunneling is investigated using an innovative nanofabrication and chemical functionalization approach, thereby opening a new era of quantum plasmonics. This new field enables the ultimate miniaturization of photonic components and provides extreme limits on light&#8211;matter interactions, permitting energy transport across the extremely small plasmonic gap. In this review, a comprehensive overview of the recent developments of quantum plasmonic resonators with particular focus on novel materials is presented. By exploring the novel gap materials in quantum regime, the potential quantum technology applications are also searched for and mapped out.

         <title>Challenges and Strategies toward Cathode Materials for Rechargeable Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 47, November 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in the design of cathode materials for potassium&#8208;ion batteries involving the use of hexacyanometalates, layered metal oxides, polyanionic frameworks, and organic compounds are reviewed. Particular emphasis is given to the intercalation reaction mechanism and the existing challenges and corresponding optimized strategies pertaining to cathode materials. Finally, an outlook of future perspectives for emerging potassium&#8208;ion batteries is presented.








Abstract
With increasing demand for grid&#8208;scale energy storage, potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) have emerged as promising complements or alternatives to commercial lithium&#8208;ion batteries owing to the low cost, natural abundance of potassium resources, the low standard reduction potential of potassium, and fascinating K+ transport kinetics in the electrolyte. However, the low energy density and unstable cycle life of cathode materials hamper their practical application. Therefore, cathode materials with high capacities, high redox potentials, and good structural stability are required with the advancement toward next&#8208;generation PIBs. To this end, understanding the structure&#8208;dependent intercalation electrochemistry and recognizing the existing issues relating to cathode materials are indispensable prerequisites. This review summarizes the recent advances of PIB cathode materials, including metal hexacyanometalates, layered metal oxides, polyanionic frameworks, and organic compounds, with an emphasis on the structural advantages of the K+ intercalation reaction. Moreover, major current challenges with corresponding strategies for each category of cathode materials are highlighted. Finally, future research directions and perspectives are presented to accelerate the development of PIBs and facilitate commercial applications. It is believed that this review will provide practical guidance for researchers engaged in developing next&#8208;generation advanced PIB cathode materials.

Abstract
Flexible tactile sensors capable of measuring mechanical stimuli via physical contact have attracted significant attention in the field of human&#8208;interactive systems. The utilization of tactile information can complement vision and/or sound interaction and provide new functionalities. Recent advancements in micro/nanotechnology, material science, and information technology have resulted in the development of high&#8208;performance tactile sensors that reach and even surpass the tactile sensing ability of human skin. Here, important advances in flexible tactile sensors over recent years are summarized, from sensor designs to system&#8208;level applications. This review focuses on the representative strategies based on design and material configurations for improving key performance parameters including sensitivity, detection range/linearity, response time/hysteresis, spatial resolution/crosstalk, multidirectional force detection, and insensitivity to other stimuli. System&#8208;level integration for practical applications beyond conceptual prototypes and promising applications, such as artificial electronic skin for robotics and prosthetics, wearable controllers for electronics, and bidirectional communication tools, are also discussed. Finally, perspectives on issues regarding further advances are provided.

         <title>Synergetic Advantages of Atomically Coupled 2D Inorganic and Graphene Nanosheets as Versatile Building Blocks for Diverse Functional Nanohybrids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 47, November 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergetic coupling between atomically coupled inorganic and graphene nanosheets provides valuable opportunity to create unexpected new functionalities and to finely tailor the physicochemical properties of hybridized nanosheets. The application of homogenously mixed inorganic and graphene nanosheets as precursors leads to the synthesis of new classes of heterogeneous 2D hybrid materials with various promising functionalities in the diverse fields.








Abstract
2D nanostructured materials, including inorganic and graphene nanosheets, have evoked plenty of scientific research activity due to their intriguing properties and excellent functionalities. The complementary advantages and common 2D crystal shapes of inorganic and graphene nanosheets render their homogenous mixtures powerful building blocks for novel high&#8208;performance functional hybrid materials. The nanometer&#8208;level thickness of 2D inorganic/graphene nanosheets allows the achievement of unusually strong electronic couplings between sheets, leading to a remarkable improvement in preexisting functionalities and the creation of unexpected properties. The synergetic merits of atomically coupled 2D inorganic&#8211;graphene nanosheets are presented here in the exploration of novel heterogeneous functional materials, with an emphasis on their critical roles as hybridization building blocks, interstratified sheets, additives, substrates, and deposited monolayers. The great flexibility and controllability of the elemental compositions, defect structures, and surface natures of inorganic&#8211;graphene nanosheets provide valuable opportunities for exploring high&#8208;performance nanohybrids applicable as electrodes for supercapacitors and rechargeable batteries, electrocatalysts, photocatalysts, and water purification agents, to give some examples. An outlook on future research perspectives for the exploitation of emerging 2D nanosheet&#8208;based hybrid materials is also presented along with novel synthetic strategies to maximize the synergetic advantage of atomically mixed 2D inorganic&#8211;graphene nanosheets.

The existing sensors are systematically categorized as chemical, biological, and physical sensors. Each category is then classified into various subcategories depending on the electrical, electrochemical, structural, or optical sensing mechanism, which are the four fundamental working mechanisms of sensors. Representative structural and electrical approaches for boosting the performance of each category are presented. Finally, factors that hinder commercializing MXene&#8208;based sensors are discussed, and several breakthroughs in realizing commercially available MXene&#8208;based sensors are suggested. This review provides broad insights pertaining to previous and existing MXene&#8208;based sensor technology and perspectives on the future generation of low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;performance, and multimodal sensors for soft&#8208;electronics applications.

Owing to their electrically programmable remnant polarization, soft ferroelectrics have gained much interest, allowing the development of remarkable flexible photoelectronic devices with a built&#8208;in electric field. A comprehensive review of the current progress of soft ferroelectric materials with an emphasis on their ferroelectric switching mechanisms and their potential application in human&#8208;connected intelligent electronics is provided.








Abstract
Soft ferroelectrics based on organic and organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid materials have gained much interest among researchers owing to their electrically programmable and remnant polarization. This allows for the development of numerous flexible, foldable, and stretchable nonvolatile memories, when combined with various crystal engineering approaches to optimize their performance. Soft ferroelectrics have been recently considered to have an important role in the emerging human&#8208;connected electronics that involve diverse photoelectronic elements, particularly those requiring precise programmable electric fields, such as tactile sensors, synaptic devices, displays, photodetectors, and solar cells for facile human&#8211;machine interaction, human safety, and sustainability. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the recent developments in soft ferroelectric materials with an emphasis on their ferroelectric switching principles and their potential application in human&#8208;connected intelligent electronics. Based on the origins of ferroelectric atomic and/or molecular switching, the soft ferroelectrics are categorized into seven subgroups. In this review, the efficiency of soft ferroelectrics with their distinct ferroelectric characteristics utilized in various human&#8208;connected electronic devices with programmable electric field is demonstrated. This review inspires further research to utilize the remarkable functionality of soft electronics.

         <title>Hydrogen Gas Sensors Using Palladium Nanogaps on an Elastomeric Substrate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 47, November 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pd&#8208;nanogap&#8208;based sensors, which operate with a gap opening and closing mechanism, typically have many advantages, such as very high sensitivity and reliability and rapid response, compared to conventional Pd&#8208;based sensors operated by electron scattering mechanisms. The progress and advanced approaches achieved over the last decade for Pd&#8208;nanogap&#8208;based H2 sensors supported on elastomeric substrates are reviewed.








Abstract
With the recent reillumination of the hydrogen economy around the world, the demand for H2 sensors is expected to increase rapidly. Due to safety issues caused by the highly flammable and explosive character of hydrogen gas (H2), it is imperative to develop the sensors that can quickly and sensitively detect H2 leaks. For the development of H2 sensors, Pd&#8208;based materials have been extensively used due to the high affinity of Pd metal for H2. Among Pd&#8208;based H2 sensors, Pd nanogap&#8208;based sensors have been extensively investigated because these sensors can operate in an on&#8211;off manner, which enables them to have improved sensing capabilities, including high sensitivity, rapid response, short recovery time, and good reliability. Importantly, significant advances in H2&#8208;sensing performance have been achieved by simply using an elastomeric substrate to form Pd nanogaps. Herein, the progress and advanced approaches achieved over the last decade for Pd nanogap&#8208;based H2 sensors supported on elastomeric substrates are reviewed, with a focus on strategies to reduce detection limits and increase reliability, sensitivity, and stability.

&lt;p&gt;With the recent reillumination of the hydrogen economy around the world, the demand for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sensors is expected to increase rapidly. Due to safety issues caused by the highly flammable and explosive character of hydrogen gas (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), it is imperative to develop the sensors that can quickly and sensitively detect H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; leaks. For the development of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sensors, Pd-based materials have been extensively used due to the high affinity of Pd metal for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Among Pd-based H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sensors, Pd nanogap-based sensors have been extensively investigated because these sensors can operate in an on&#8211;off manner, which enables them to have improved sensing capabilities, including high sensitivity, rapid response, short recovery time, and good reliability. Importantly, significant advances in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-sensing performance have been achieved by simply using an elastomeric substrate to form Pd nanogaps. Herein, the progress and advanced approaches achieved over the last decade for Pd nanogap-based H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sensors supported on elastomeric substrates are reviewed, with a focus on strategies to reduce detection limits and increase reliability, sensitivity, and stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chiral Perovskites for Next&#8208;Generation Photonics: From Chirality Transfer to Chiroptical Activity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 47, November 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral perovskites have attracted a considerable amount of attention in chiral photonics. Despite their exceptional dissymmetric optical behavior, a clear understanding of their chirality transfer mechanism is still elusive. The underlying chirality&#8208;transfer mechanism is elucidated based on theoretical considerations, while suggesting insightful perspectives. Additionally, promising strategies to exploit the potential of chiral perovskites are also discussed.








Abstract
Organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid halide perovskites (OIHPs) are commonly used as prototypical materials for various applications, including photovoltaics, photodetectors, and light&#8208;emitting devices. Since the chiroptical properties of OIHPs are deciphered in 2017, chiral OIHPs have been rediscovered as new hybrid systems comprising chiral organic molecules and achiral inorganic octahedral layers. Owing to their exceptional optoelectrical properties and structural flexibility, chiral OIHPs have received a considerable amount of attention in chiral photonics, chiroptoelectronics, spintronics, and ferroelectrics. Despite their intriguing chiral properties, the transfer mechanism from chiral molecules to achiral semiconductors has not been extensively investigated. Furthermore, an in&#8208;depth understanding of the origin of chiroptical activity is still elusive. In this review article, recent advances in the chiroptical activities of chiral OIHPs and polarization&#8208;based devices adopting chiral OIHPs are comprehensively discussed, and insight into the underlying chirality transfer mechanism based on theoretical considerations is provided. This comprehensive survey, with an emphasis on the chirality transfer mechanism, will help readers understand the chiroptical properties of OIHPs, which are crucial for the development of spin&#8208;based photonic and optoelectronic devices. Additionally, promising strategies to exploit the potential of chiral OIHPs are also discussed.

         <title>Emerging Materials and Technologies with Applications in Flexible Neural Implants: A Comprehensive Review of Current Issues with Neural Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 47, November 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible implants have attracted increasing interest, mainly to overcome the mechanical mismatch between rigid materials and soft neural tissues, enabling precise measurements of neural signals from conformal contact. The current issues of flexible neural implants are summarized by presenting material candidates and designs to address challenges. Furthermore, the latest investigations associated with each issue are also introduced.








Abstract
Neuroscience is an essential field of investigation that reveals the identity of human beings, with a comprehensive understanding of advanced mental activities, through the study of neurobiological structures and functions. Fully understanding the neurotransmission system that allows for connectivity among neuronal circuits has paved the way for the development of treatments for neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and depression. The field of flexible implants has attracted increasing interest mainly to overcome the mechanical mismatch between rigid electrode materials and soft neural tissues, enabling precise measurements of neural signals from conformal contact. Here, the current issues of flexible neural implants (chronic device failure, non&#8208;bioresorbable electronics, low&#8208;density electrode arrays, among others are summarized) by presenting material candidates and designs to address each challenge. Furthermore, the latest investigations associated with the aforementioned issues are also introduced, including suggestions for ideal neural implants. In terms of the future direction of these advances, designing flexible devices would provide new opportunities for the study of brain&#8211;machine interfaces or brain&#8211;computer interfaces as part of locomotion through brain signals, and for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 47, November 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanomaterials have a significant potential for creating sophisticated complexes, mimicking the natural size and structures of viruses without the complications of toxicity. New approaches for applying advanced nanomaterial&#8208;based platform technologies to future diagnostics, vaccines, and antiviral treatments against emerging infectious diseases are reviewed. The unmet needs and future directions of current nanomaterial&#8208;based tools in the clinical settings are also addressed.








Abstract
While the coronavirus disease (COVID&#8208;19) accounts for the current global pandemic, the emergence of other unknown pathogens, named &#8220;Disease X,&#8221; remains a serious concern in the future. Emerging or re&#8208;emerging pathogens continue to pose significant challenges to global public health. In response, the scientific community has been urged to create advanced platform technologies to meet the ever&#8208;increasing needs presented by these devastating diseases with pandemic potential. This review aims to bring new insights to allow for the application of advanced nanomaterials in future diagnostics, vaccines, and antiviral therapies, thereby addressing the challenges associated with the current preparedness strategies in clinical settings against viruses. The application of nanomaterials has advanced medicine and provided cutting&#8208;edge solutions for unmet needs. Herein, an overview of the currently available nanotechnologies is presented, highlighting the significant features that enable them to control infectious diseases, and identifying the challenges that remain to be addressed for the commercial production of nano&#8208;based products is presented. Finally, to conclude, the development of a nanomaterial&#8208;based system using a &#8220;One Health&#8221; approach is suggested. This strategy would require a transdisciplinary collaboration and communication between all stakeholders throughout the entire process spanning across research and development, as well as the preclinical, clinical, and manufacturing phases.

         <title>Conjugated Organic Photothermal Films for Spatiotemporal Thermal Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 47, November 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photothermal conjugated polymer films are reviewed along with their emerging applications from the perspective of their working principles. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art organic molecular and polymeric materials are summarized, and their photothermal conversion efficiencies are correlated to the chemical structures, light absorption, and electronic properties of the films.








Abstract
With the growth of photoenergy harvesting and thermal engineering, photothermal materials (PTMs) have attracted substantial interest due to their unique functions such as localized heat generation, spatiotemporal thermal controllability, invisibility, and light harvesting capabilities. In particular, &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic PTMs show advantages over inorganic or metallic PTMs in thin film applications due to their large light absorptivity, ease of synthesis and tunability of molecular structures for realizing high NIR absorption, flexibility, and solution processability. This review is intended to provide an overview of organic PTMs, including both molecular and polymeric PTMs. A description of the photothermal (PT) effect and conversion efficiency (&#951;PT) for organic films is provided. After that, the chemical structure and optical properties of organic PTMs are discussed. Finally, emerging applications of organic PT films from the perspective of spatiotemporal thermal engineering principles are illustrated.

&lt;p&gt;Photothermal conjugated polymer films are reviewed along with their emerging applications from the perspective of their working principles. The state-of-the-art organic molecular and polymeric materials are summarized, and their photothermal conversion efficiencies are correlated to the chemical structures, light absorption, and electronic properties of the films.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the growth of photoenergy harvesting and thermal engineering, photothermal materials (PTMs) have attracted substantial interest due to their unique functions such as localized heat generation, spatiotemporal thermal controllability, invisibility, and light harvesting capabilities. In particular, &#960;-conjugated organic PTMs show advantages over inorganic or metallic PTMs in thin film applications due to their large light absorptivity, ease of synthesis and tunability of molecular structures for realizing high NIR absorption, flexibility, and solution processability. This review is intended to provide an overview of organic PTMs, including both molecular and polymeric PTMs. A description of the photothermal (PT) effect and conversion efficiency (&#951;&lt;sub&gt;PT&lt;/sub&gt;) for organic films is provided. After that, the chemical structure and optical properties of organic PTMs are discussed. Finally, emerging applications of organic PT films from the perspective of spatiotemporal thermal engineering principles are illustrated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Review of Phototransistors Using Metal Oxide Semiconductors: Research Progress and Future Directions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 47, November 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;oxide&#8208;based phototransistors conventionally have a limit of detection range and persistent photocurrent (PPC) phenomenon, which may hinder their potential applications in devices. To solve the aforementioned problems, the latest approaches for the absorption layer are reviewed according to surface treatment, structural engineering, and the absorption materials. Furthermore, perspectives on emerging applications and outlooks are introduced.








Abstract
Metal oxide thin&#8208;film transistors have been continuously researched and mass&#8208;produced in the display industry. However, their phototransistors are still in their infancy. In particular, utilizing metal oxide semiconductors as phototransistors is difficult because of the limited light absorption wavelength range and persistent photocurrent (PPC) phenomenon. Numerous studies have attempted to improve the detectable light wavelength range and the PPC phenomenon. Here, recent studies on metal oxide phototransistors are reviewed, which have improved the range of light wavelengths and the PPC phenomenon by introducing an absorption layer of oxide or non&#8208;oxide hybrid structure. The materials of the absorption layer applied to absorb long&#8208;wavelength light are classified into oxides, chalcogenides, organic materials, perovskites, and nanodots. Finally, next&#8208;generation convergence studies combined with other research fields are introduced and future research directions are detailed.

         <title>Ultrafast Synthesis of I&#8208;Rich Lithium Argyrodite Glass&#8211;Ceramic Electrolyte with High Ionic Conductivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrafast synthesis of lithium argyrodite Li6&#8211;xPS5&#8211;xI1+x glass&#8211;ceramic electrolytes is accomplished via ultimate&#8208;energy mechanical alloying method within 1 h. A 45% S2&#8211;/I&#8211; disorder at 4d sites together with an ionic conductivity over 2 mS cm&#8211;1 is achieved for the optimal Li5.6PS4.6I1.4. The LiI&#8208;containing anodic interface helps solid&#8208;state batteries demonstrate prominent cycling stability and rate performance.








Abstract
Lithium argyrodites are one of the most promising sulfide electrolytes due to their high ionic conductivity and ductile feature. Among them, Li6PS5I (LPSI) exhibits better stability against Li metal but a rather low ionic conductivity (only &#8776;10&#8722;6 S cm&#8722;1) because of the absence of S2&#8722;/I&#8722; disorder. Herein, argyrodite Li6&#8722;xPS5&#8722;xI1+x glass&#8211;ceramic electrolytes with high iodine content are synthesized using ultimate&#8208;energy mechanical alloying method. S2&#8722;/I&#8722; disorder is successfully introduced into the system by doping LiI during this one&#8208;pot process. Determined by 6Li magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, the introduction of iodine promotes Li+ inter&#8208;cage jumps, leading to an enhanced long&#8208;range Li+ conducting. The Li5.6PS4.6I1.4 glass&#8211;ceramic electrolyte (LPSI1.4&#8208;gc) possesses high ionic conductivity (2.04 mS cm&#8722;1) and excellent stability against Li metal. The Li symmetric cell with the LPSI1.4&#8208;gc electrolyte demonstrates ultralong cycling stability over 3200 h at 0.2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. LiCoO2/Li6PS5Cl/Li all&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery applying LPSI1.4&#8208;gc as the anode interlayer also presents prominent cycling and rate performance. This work provides a novel type of electrolyte with high ionic conductivity and stability against Li metal.

         <title>Single Crystals Heterogeneity Impacts the Intrinsic and Extrinsic Properties of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of heterogeneities in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) can be enormous at the single&#8208;particle level but is often neglected in characterization due to the lack of microscopes capable of correlated studies on the same crystals. The authors present an analysis platform for correlated, in situ spectroscopy and imaging named MOSAIC, and unveil new heterogeneity&#8211;property relations for two important MOF systems.








Abstract
At present, an enormous characterization gap exists between the study of the crystal structure of a material and its bulk properties. Individual particles falling within this gap cannot be fully characterized in a correlative manner by current methods. The authors address this problem by exploiting the noninvasive nature of optical microscopy and spectroscopy for the correlative analysis of metal&#8208;organic framework particles in situ. They probe the intrinsic as well as extrinsic properties in a correlated manner. The authors show that the crystal shape of MIL&#8208;88A strongly impacts its optical absorption. Furthermore, the question of how homogeneously water is distributed and adsorbed within one of the most promising materials for harvesting water from humid air, MOF&#8208;801, is addressed. The results demonstrate the considerable importance of the particle level and how it can affect the property of the material.

         <title>Coordination Polymer&#8208;Coated CaCO3 Reinforces Radiotherapy by Reprogramming the Immunosuppressive Metabolic Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acidity&#8208;IDO1 modulation nanoparticles (AIM NPs) can effectively promote the transition of immunosuppressive (cold) tumor microenvironment to immune&#8208;activated (hot) one via simultaneous tumor acidity neutralization and Kyn depletion. In synergizing with AIM NPs injection, treatment with external X&#8208;ray irradiation can effectively suppress the growth of irradiated primary tumors, distant unirradiated (metastatic) tumors, and rechallenged (relapsed) tumors by eliciting potent antitumor immunity.








Abstract
Radiotherapy is widely exploited for the treatment of a large range of cancers in clinic, but its therapeutic effectiveness is seriously crippled by the tumor immunosuppression, mainly driven by the altered metabolism of cancer cells. Here, a pH&#8208;responsive nanomedicine is prepared by coating calcium carbonate (CaCO3) nanoparticles with 4&#8208;phenylimidazole (4PI), an inhibitor against indoleamine 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase 1 (IDO&#8208;1), together with zinc ions via the coordination reaction, aiming at reinforcing the treatment outcome of radiotherapy. The obtained pH&#8208;responsive nanomedicine, coined as acidity&#8208;IDO1&#8208;modulation nanoparticles (AIM NPs), is able to instantly neutralize protons, and release 4PI to suppress the IDO1&#8208;mediated production of kynurenine (Kyn) upon tumor accumulation. As a result, treatment with AIM NPs can remarkably enhance the therapeutic efficacy of radiotherapy against both murine CT26 and 4T1 tumors by eliciting potent antitumor immunity. Furthermore, it is shown that such combination treatment can effectively suppress the growth of untreated distant tumors via the abscopal effect, and result in immune memory responses to reject rechallenged tumors. This work highlights a novel strategy of simultaneous tumor acidity neutralization and IDO1 inhibition to potentiate radiotherapy, with great promises to suppress tumor metastasis and recurrence by eliciting robust antitumor immunity.

         <title>Quenching&#8208;Resistant Multiresonance TADF Emitter Realizes 40% External Quantum Efficiency in Narrowband Electroluminescence at High Doping Level</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular design tactic to achieve quenching&#8208;resistant multiresonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters is proposed by fencing the MR&#8208;skeleton with steric units. Excellent electroluminescence performances are recorded in corresponding organic light&#8208;emitting diodes, with record&#8208;breaking external quantum efficiencies up to 40.0% and full width at half maximum values of only 25&#160;nm.








Abstract
Multiresonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters manifest great potential for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) due to their high exciton&#8208;utilization efficiency and narrowband emission. Nonetheless, their tendency toward self&#8208;quenching caused by strong interchromophore interactions would induce doping sensitivity and deteriorate the device performances, and effective strategy to construct quenching&#8208;resistant emitters without sacrifycing color purity is still to be developed. By segregating the planar MR&#8208;TADF skeleton using two bulky carbazolyl units, herein a highly emissive molecule with enhanced quenching resistance is reported. The steric effect largely removes the formation of detrimental excimers/aggregates, and boosts the performance of the corresponding devices with a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) up to 40.0% and full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 25&#160;nm, representative of the only example of single OLED that can concurrently achieve narrow bandwidth and high EL efficiency surpassing 40% to date. Even at doping ratio of 30 wt%, the EQEmax is retained to be 33.3% with nearly unchanged emission spectrum. This work provides a viable approach to realize doping&#8208;insensitive MR&#8208;TADF devices with extreme EL efficiency and color purity for high&#8208;end OLED displays.

         <title>Stapled Liposomes Enhance Cross&#8208;Priming of Radio&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An antigen&#8208;capturing stapled liposome (ACSL) with robust structure and bioactive surface that can capture and transport tumor&#8208;associated antigens (TAAs) from lysosomes to cytoplasm in dendritic cells, thereby enhancing the TAA cross&#8208;presentation for effective radio&#8208;immunotherapy is demonstrated.








Abstract
The release of tumor&#8208;associated antigens (TAAs) and their cross&#8208;presentation in dendritic cells (DCs) are crucial for radio&#8208;immunotherapy. However, the irradiation resistance of tumor cells usually results in limited TAA generation and release. Importantly, TAAs internalized by DCs are easily degraded in lysosomes, resulting in unsatisfactory extent of TAA cross&#8208;presentation. Herein, an antigen&#8208;capturing stapled liposome (ACSL) with a robust structure and bioactive surface is developed. The ACSLs capture and transport TAAs from lysosomes to the cytoplasm in DCs, thereby enhancing TAA cross&#8208;presentation. l&#8208;arginine encapsulated in ACSLs induces robust T cell&#8208;dependent antitumor response and immune memory in 4T1 tumor&#8208;bearing mice after local irradiation, resulting in significant tumor suppression and an abscopal effect. Replacing l&#8208;arginine with radiosensitizers, photosensitizers, and photothermal agents may make ACSL a universal platform for the rapid development of various combinations of anticancer therapies.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Free Metal Deposition on 2D Materials via Inkjet Printing Technology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The evaporation of Au or the sputtering of Cr on 2D layered hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) produces local atomic defects in its structure, specially at its interfaces, which increases the leakage current across it. It is found that the deposition of metal on hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) using inkjet printing does not introduce any defect, and maintains its layered structure free of defects.








Abstract
2D materials have many outstanding properties that make them attractive for the fabrication of electronic devices, such as high conductivity, flexibility, and transparency. However, integrating 2D materials in commercial devices and circuits is challenging because their structure and properties can be damaged during the fabrication process. Recent studies have demonstrated that standard metal deposition techniques (like electron beam evaporation and sputtering) significantly damage the atomic structure of 2D materials. Here it is shown that the deposition of metal via inkjet printing technology does not produce any observable damage in the atomic structure of ultrathin 2D materials, and it can keep a sharp interface. These conclusions are supported by abundant data obtained via atomistic simulations, transmission electron microscopy, nanochemical metrology, and device characterization in a probe station. The results are important for the understanding of inkjet printing technology applied to 2D materials, and they could contribute to the better design and optimization of electronic devices and circuits.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on the fundamental understanding of the characteristics and challenges of the &#8220;beyond aqueous&#8221; electrolytes of zinc&#8208;ion batteries, including conventional organic electrolytes, ionic liquid, all/quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes, and goes deep into the discussion on the pros and cons of each electrolyte. Lastly, this review presents a perspective on the challenges and future opportunities for the &#8220;beyond aqueous&#8221; electrolytes.








Abstract
With the growing demands for large&#8208;scale energy storage, Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) with distinct advantages, including resource abundance, low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;safety, and acceptable energy density, are considered&#160;as potential substitutes for Li&#8208;ion batteries. Although numerous efforts are devoted to design and develop high performance cathodes and aqueous electrolytes for ZIBs, many challenges, such as hydrogen evolution reaction, water evaporation, and liquid leakage, have greatly hindered the development of aqueous ZIBs. Developing &#8220;beyond aqueous&#8221; electrolytes can be able to avoid these issues due to the absence of water, which are beneficial for the achieving of highly efficient ZIBs. In this review, the recent development of the &#8220;beyond aqueous&#8221; electrolytes, including conventional organic electrolytes, ionic liquid, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state, quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes, and deep eutectic electrolytes are presented. The critical issues and the corresponding strategies of the designing of &#8220;beyond aqueous&#8221; electrolytes for ZIBs are also summarized.

         <title>Design of Materials Configuration for Optimizing Redox&#8208;Based Resistive Switching Memories</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Influence of electrode and capping layer materials configuration in HfO2&#8208;based electrochemical metallization memory (ECM) and valence&#8208;change memory (VCM) types of redox&#8208;based resistive random access memory (ReRAM) cells is presented. Cyclic voltammetry reveals different interfacial electrochemical redox processes. The modulation of the resistive switching characteristics by varying the capping layer material in a combination with counter(bottom) electrode configurations are demonstrated and highlighted.








Abstract
Redox&#8208;based resistive random access memories (ReRAMs) are based on electrochemical processes of oxidation and reduction within the devices. The selection of materials and material combinations strongly influence the related nanoscale processes, playing a crucial role in resistive switching properties and functionalities. To date, however, comprehensive studies on device design accounting for a combination of factors such as electrodes, electrolytes, and capping layer materials related to their thicknesses and interactions are scarce. In this work, the impact of materials&#8217; configuration on interfacial redox reactions in HfO2&#8208;based electrochemical metallization memory (ECM) and valence&#8208;change memory (VCM) systems is reported. The redox processes are studied by cyclic voltammetry, and the corresponding resistive switching characteristics are investigated. In ECM cells, the overall cell resistance depends on the electrocatalytic activity of the counter electrode. Nonetheless, the capping layer material further influences the cell resistance and the SET and RESET voltages. In VCM systems, the influence of the electrode material configuration is also pronounced, and is capable of modulating the active resistive switching interface. For both types of memory cells, the switching behavior changes significantly with variation of the oxide thickness. The results present important materials selection criteria for rationale design of ReRAM cells for various memristive applications.

         <title>Double&#8208;Layer Nacre&#8208;Inspired Polyimide&#8208;Mica Nanocomposite Films with Excellent Mechanical Stability for LEO Environmental Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polyimide&#8208;mica (PI&#8208;Mica) nanocomposite film with outstanding mechanical properties and atomic oxygen resistance is produced by integrating mica nanosheets with polyimide into a double&#8208;layer nacre&#8208;inspired structure with a much higher density of mica in the top layer. This unique microstructure and advantages of mica also impart the film with favorable resistance to ultraviolet, space debris, and high temperatures.








Abstract
Owing to their outstanding comprehensive performance, polyimide (PI) composite films are widely used on the external surfaces of spacecraft to protect them from the adverse conditions of low Earth orbit (LEO). However, current PI composite films have inadequate mechanical properties and atomic oxygen (AO) resistance. Herein, this work fabricates a new PI&#8208;based nanocomposite film with greatly enhanced mechanical properties and AO resistance by integrating mica nanosheets with PI into a unique double&#8208;layer nacre&#8208;inspired structure with a much higher density of mica nanosheets in the top layer. In addition, the unique microstructure and the intrinsic properties of mica also impart the nanocomposite film with favorable ultraviolet and high&#8208;temperature resistance. The comprehensive performance of this material is superior to those of pure PI, single&#8208;layer PI&#8208;mica, and previously reported PI&#8208;based composite films. Thus, the double&#8208;layer nanocomposite film displays great potential as an aerospace material for use in LEO.

         <title>Silk Embolic Material for Catheter&#8208;Directed Endovascular Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Embolic materials today are clinically approved for achieving vascular occlusion. In this work, a biomaterial comprising silk fibroin and nanoclay is developed and optimized as a multifunctional embolic agent that offers both embolization and drug&#8208;delivery capabilities. The silk embolic material exhibits excellent transcatheter injectability, mechanical strength, biocompatibility, and hemocompatibility to serve as a catheter&#8208;directed embolic drug carrier for the treatment of vascular diseases.








Abstract
Embolization is a catheter&#8208;based minimally invasive procedure that deliberately occludes diseased blood vessels for treatment purposes. A novel silk&#8208;based embolic material (SEM) that is developed and optimized to provide tandem integration of both embolization and the delivery of therapeutics is reported. Natural silk is processed into fibroin proteins of varying lengths and is combined with charged nanoclay particles to allow visibility and injectability using clinical catheters as small as 600 &#956;m in diameter at lengths &gt;100&#160;cm.&#160;SEMs loaded with fluorochrome labeled bovine albumin and Nivolumab, which is among the most used immunotherapy drugs worldwide, demonstrate a sustained release profile in vitro over 28 days. In a porcine renal survival model, SEMs with labeled albumin and Nivolumab successfully embolize porcine arteries without recanalization and lead to the delivery of both albumin and Nivolumab into the interstitial space of the renal cortex. Mechanistically, it is shown that tissue delivery is most optimal when the internal elastic membrane of the embolized artery is disrupted. SEM is a potential next&#8208;generation multifunctional embolic agent that can achieve embolization and deliver a wide range of therapeutics to treat vascular diseases including tumors.

         <title>Two&#8208;Photon 3D Laser Printing Inside Synthetic Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Towards the ambitious goal of manufacturing synthetic cells from the bottom up, various cellular components have already been reconstituted inside of lipid vesicles. However, the deterministic positioning of these components inside the compartment has remained elusive. Here, by using two&#8208;photon 3D laser printing, 2D and 3D hydrogel architectures were&#160;manufactured with high precision and nearly arbitrary shape inside of preformed giant unilamellar lipid vesicles (GUVs). The required water&#8208;soluble photoresist is brought into the GUVs by diffusion in a single mixing step. Crucially, femtosecond two&#8208;photon printing inside the compartment does not destroy the GUVs. Beyond this proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle demonstration, early functional architectures were&#160;realized. In particular, a transmembrane structure acting as a pore was&#160;3D printed, thereby allowing for the transport of biological cargo, including DNA, into the synthetic compartment. These experiments show that two&#8208;photon 3D laser microprinting can be an important addition to the existing toolbox of synthetic&#160;biology.

Abstract
Four&#8208;dimensional quantitative characterization of heterogeneous materials using in situ synchrotron radiation computed tomography can reveal 3D sub&#8208;micron features, particularly damage, evolving under load, leading to improved materials. However, dataset size and complexity increasingly require time&#8208;intensive and subjective semi&#8208;automatic segmentations. Here, we present the first deep learning (DL) convolutional neural network (CNN) segmentation of multiclass microscale damage in heterogeneous bulk materials, teaching on advanced aerospace&#8208;grade composite damage using &#8764;65,000 (trained) human&#8208;segmented tomograms. The trained CNN machine segments complex and sparse (&lt;&lt;1% of volume) composite damage classes to &#8764;99.99% agreement, unlocking both objectivity and efficiency, with nearly 100% of the human time eliminated, which traditional rule&#8208;based algorithms do not approach. The trained machine is found to perform as well or better than the human due to &#8220;machine&#8208;discovered&#8221; human segmentation error, with machine improvements manifesting primarily as new damage discovery and segmentation augmentation/extension in artifact&#8208;rich tomograms. Interrogating a high&#8208;level network hyperparametric space on two material configurations, we find DL to be a disruptive approach to quantitative structure&#8208;property characterization, enabling high&#8208;throughput knowledge creation (accelerated by 2 orders of magnitude) via generalizable, ultra&#8208;high&#8208;resolution feature segmentation.

         <title>Highly Efficient Self&#8208;Healing Multifunctional Dressing with Antibacterial Activity for Sutureless Wound Closure and Infected Wound Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel self&#8208;healing elastomer&#8208;based multifunctional wound dressing (MFWD) with desirable mechanical robustness, biocompatibility, and antibacterial activity is developed for effective wound management. MFWD assists in contracting wound edges, based on the excellent self&#8208;healing ability of the elastomer. The wound status can also be comprehensively monitored and reported with this MFWD.








Abstract
Wound healing represents a major clinical and public healthcare problem that is frequently challenged by infection risks, detrimental consequences on the surrounding tissues, and difficulties to monitor the healing process. Here we&#160;report on a novel self&#8208;healing, antibacterial, and multifunctional wound dressing for sutureless wound closure and real&#8208;time monitoring of the healing parameters. The self&#8208;healing elastomer contains cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and has high mechanical toughness (35&#160;MJ m&#8722;3), biocompatibility, and outstanding antibacterial activity (bactericidal rate is &#8776;90% in 12 h), enabling the wound dressing to effectively inhibit bacterial growth and accelerate infected wound healing. In vivo tests based on full&#8208;thickness skin incision model shows that the multifunctional wound dressing can help in contracting wound edges and facilitate wound closure and healing, as could be evidenced by notably dense and well&#8208;organized collagen deposition. The test provides an evidence that the integrated sensor array within the multifunctional wound dressing can monitor temperature, pH, and glucose level of the wound area in real&#8208;time, providing reliable and timely information of the condition of the wound. Ultimately, the reported multifunctional dressing would be of high value in managing the burden associated with wound healing via personalised monitoring and treatment approaches, digital and other people&#8208;centred solutions for health care.

         <title>Evolution from Lead&#8208;Based to Lead&#8208;Free Piezoelectrics: Engineering of Lattices, Domains, Boundaries, and Defects Leading to Giant Response</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergetic combination of conventional and emergent strategies to enhance piezoelectricity, with a deeper understanding of structure&#8211;property relationship using advanced state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art techniques, can lead to a breakthrough in giant piezoelectricity with the desired characteristics.








Abstract
Piezoelectric materials are known to mankind for more than a century, with numerous advancements made in both scientific understandings and practical applications. In the last two decades, in particular, the research on piezoelectrics has largely been driven by the constantly changing technological demand, and the drive toward a sustainable society. Hence, environmental&#8208;friendly &#8220;lead&#8208;free piezoelectrics&#8221; have emerged in the anticipation of replacing lead&#8208;based counterparts with at least comparable performance. However, there are still obstacles to be overcome for realizing this objective, while the efforts in this direction already seem to culminate. Therefore, novel structural strategies need to be designed to address these issues and for further breakthrough in this field. Here, various strategies to enhance piezoelectric properties in lead&#8208;free systems with fundamental and historical context, and from atomic to macroscopic scale, are explored. The main challenges currently faced in the transition from lead&#8208;based to lead&#8208;free piezoelectrics are identified and key milestones for future research in this field are suggested. These include: i) decoding the fundamental mechanisms; ii) large temperature&#8208;stable piezoresponse; and iii) fabrication&#8208;friendly and tailorable composition. Strategic insights and general guidelines for the synergistic design of new piezoelectric materials for obtaining a large piezoelectric response are also provided.

         <title>Reconfiguring Colors of Single Relief Structures by Directional Stretching</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Color changes can be achieved by straining photonic crystals or gratings embedded in stretchable materials. However, the multiple repeat units and the need for a volumetric assembly of nanostructures limit the density of information content. Inspired by surface reliefs on oracle bones and music records as means of information archival, here we endow surface&#8208;relief elastomers with multiple sets of information that are accessible by mechanical straining along in&#8208;plane axes. Distinct from Bragg diffraction effects from periodic structures, we report trenches that generate color due to variations in trench depth, enabling individual trench segments to support a single color. Using 3D printed cuboids, we replicated trenches of varying geometric parameters in elastomers. These parameters determine the initial color (or lack thereof), the response to capillary forces, and the appearance when strained along or across the trenches. Strain induces modulation in trench depth or the opening and closure of a trench, resulting in surface reliefs with up to six distinct states, and an initially featureless surface that reveals two distinct images when stretched along different axes. The highly reversible structural colors are promising in optical data archival, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and strain&#8208;sensing applications.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;mediated Intracellular Polymerization of AIEgens for Light&#8208;up Tumor Localization and Theranostics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Improving the enrichment of drugs or theranostic agents within tumors is vital to achieve effective cancer diagnosis and therapy with reduced dosage and damage to normal tissues. In this work, we describe an enzyme&#8208;mediated AIEgen intracellular polymerization strategy that can simultaneously promote the accumulation and retention of the AIEgen in the tumor for prolonged imaging and enhanced tumor growth inhibition. We rationally designed an AIEgen&#8208;peptide conjugate (D2P1) and cyanobenzothiazole&#8208;cysteine (3CBT) that can undergo rapid condensation reaction to form nanoaggregates in tumor cells. Upon tumor&#8208;specific cathepsin protease reaction, the cleavage of peptides induces condensate polymerization between the exposed cysteine and 2&#8208;cyanobenzothiazole on 3CBT, triggering accumulation of D2P1 into the tumor site, leading to fluorescence light&#8208;up. Such enzyme&#8208;mediated polymerization of D2P1 and 3CBT alters cellular motility via disrupting actin organization and in turn inhibiting cell proliferation. In addition, due to the built&#8208;in intrinsic photosensitization property of the AIEgen, the accumulation of D2P1 could remarkably promote the tumor photodynamic therapy effect in vivo under light irradiation. This study thus represents the enzyme&#8208;mediated intracellular polymerization system with high potential to improve the diagnostic and therapeutic outcomes of tumors in vivo.

         <title>Ternary Blend Organic Solar Cells: Understanding the Morphology from Recent Progress</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Ternary blend organic solar cells (TB&#8208;OSCs) incorporating multiple donor and/or acceptor materials into the active layer have emerged as a promising strategy to simultaneously improve the overall device parameters for realizing higher performances than binary devices. Whereas, introducing multiple materials also results in the more complicated morphology than their binary blend counterparts. Understanding the morphology is crucial important for further improving the device performance of TB&#8208;OSC. This review introduces the solubility and miscibility parameters that affecting the morphology of ternary blends. Then, this review summarizes the recent processes of morphology study on ternary blends from the aspects of molecular crystallinity, molecular packing orientation, domain size and purity, directly observation of morphology, vertical phase separation as well as morphological stability. Finally, w e conclude with the summary and prospects of TB&#8208;OSCs.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermal monitoring of the human body with high accuracy provides a fast, facile, but powerful route in a wide range of health information standards. Ultrasensitive, and stretchable Au&#8208;doped silicon nanomembrane (SiNM) epidermal temperature sensor array achieved by property modulations of SiNM with the development of a novel gold&#8208;doping strategy offers a general foundation for continuous monitoring of human body temperature.








Abstract
Monitoring the body temperature with high accuracy provides a fast, facile, yet powerful route about the human body in a wide range of health information standards.

         <title>Thermally Controlled Charge&#8208;Carrier Transitions in Disordered PbSbTe Chalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is shown experimentally that the carrier type and mobility in Pb&#8211;Sb&#8211;Te thin films can be controlled by annealing the disordered crystal. First&#8208;principles simulations indicate that the unexpected transition from n&#8208; to p&#8208;conduction is caused by a crossover of the predominant point&#8208;defect type with increasing order. Tuning self&#8208;doping properties this way could prove useful for thermoelectric devices and other applications.








Abstract
Binary and ternary chalcogenides have recently attracted much attention due to their wide range of applications including phase&#8208;change memory materials, topological insulators, photonic switches, and thermoelectrics. These applications require a precise control of the number and mobility of charge carriers. Here, an unexpected charge&#8208;carrier transition in ternary compounds from the PbTe&#8211;Sb2Te3 pseudo&#8208;binary line is reported. Upon thermal annealing, sputtered thin films of PbSb2Te4 and Pb2Sb2Te5 undergo a transition in the temperature coefficient of resistance and in the type of the majority charge carriers from n&#8208;type to p&#8208;type. These transitions are observed upon increasing structural order within one crystallographic phase. To account for this striking observation, it is proposed that the Fermi energy shifts from the tail of the conduction band to the valence band because different levels of overall structural disorder lead to different predominant types of native point defects. This view is confirmed by an extensive computational study, revealing a transition from excess cations and SbPb for high levels of disorder to PbSb prevailing for low disorder. The findings will help fine&#8208;tune transport properties in certain chalcogenides via proper thermal treatment, with potential benefits for memories, thermoelectric material optimization, and neuromorphic devices.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Zinc(I) Active Sites to Accelerate Nitrogen Reduction Kinetics for Ammonia Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A carbon electrocatalyst with single Zn(I) sites is discovered to accelerate kinetics of hydrogenation process for efficient N2 reduction.








Abstract
Developing highly active and stable nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) catalysts for NH3 electrosynthesis remains challenging. Herein, an unusual NRR electrocatalyst is reported with a single Zn(I) site supported on hollow porous N&#8208;doped carbon nanofibers (Zn1N&#8211;C). The Zn1N&#8211;C nanofibers exhibit an outstanding NRR activity with a high NH3 yield rate of &#8776;16.1&#160;&#181;g NH3 h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1 at &#8722;0.3&#160;V and Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 11.8% in alkaline media, surpassing other previously reported carbon&#8208;based NRR electrocatalysts with transition metals atomically dispersed and nitrogen coordinated (TM&#8208;Nx) sites. 15N2 isotope labeling experiments confirm that the feeding nitrogen gas is the only nitrogen source in the production of NH3. Structural characterization reveals that atomically dispersed Zn(I) sites with Zn&#8211;N4 moieties are likely the active sites, and the nearby graphitic N site synergistically facilitates the NRR process. In situ attenuated total reflectance&#8208;Fourier transform infrared measurement and theoretical calculation elucidate that the formation of initial *NNH intermediate is the rate&#8208;limiting step during the NH3 production. The graphitic N atoms adjacent to the tetracoordinate Zn&#8211;N4 moieties could significantly lower the energy barrier for this step to accelerate hydrogenation kinetics duing the NRR.

         <title>Elucidating and Mitigating High&#8208;Voltage Degradation Cascades in Cobalt&#8208;Free LiNiO2 Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lattice oxygen loss is found to play a critical role in the O3&#8211;O1 stacking transition in cobalt&#8208;free LiNiO2 lithium&#8208;ion battery cathodes, which subsequently induces Ni&#8208;ion migration and irreversible stacking faults, microscale creep, cracking, and even bending of layers after high&#8208;voltage cycling. By suppressing oxygen evolution, hermetic graphene coatings arrest this degradation cascade, resulting in substantially improved high&#8208;voltage capacity retention.








Abstract
LiNiO2 (LNO) is a promising cathode material for next&#8208;generation Li&#8208;ion batteries due to its exceptionally high capacity and cobalt&#8208;free composition that enables more sustainable and ethical large&#8208;scale manufacturing. However, its poor cycle life at high operating voltages over 4.1&#160;V impedes its practical use, thus motivating efforts to elucidate and mitigate LiNiO2 degradation mechanisms at high states of charge. Here, a multiscale exploration of high&#8208;voltage degradation cascades associated with oxygen stacking chemistry in cobalt&#8208;free LiNiO2, is presented. Lattice oxygen loss is found to play a critical role in the local O3&#8211;O1 stacking transition at high states of charge, which subsequently leads to Ni&#8208;ion migration and irreversible stacking faults during cycling. This undesirable atomic&#8208;scale structural evolution accelerates microscale electrochemical creep, cracking, and even bending of layers, ultimately resulting in macroscopic mechanical degradation of LNO particles. By employing a graphene&#8208;based hermetic surface coating, oxygen loss is attenuated in LNO at high states of charge, which suppresses the initiation of the degradation cascade and thus substantially improves the high&#8208;voltage capacity retention of LNO. Overall, this study provides mechanistic insight into the high&#8208;voltage degradation of LNO, which will inform ongoing efforts to employ cobalt&#8208;free cathodes in Li&#8208;ion battery technology.

         <title>Tunable Supramolecular Cavities Molecularly Homogenized in Polymer Membranes for Ultraefficient Precombustion CO2 Capture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Soluble organic macrocyclic cavitands (OMCs) with interactive affinity for polymers can be utilized to design novel nanocomposite membranes with true molecular homogeneity, unlike conventional nanoarchitectures that form heterogeneous nanofiller phases within membranes that cause performance and processability issues. By adjusting the OMC cavity size within the membranes, tunable gas transport properties can be obtained for highly molecular&#8208;sieving H2/CO2 separation.








Abstract
Processable molecular&#8208;sieving membranes are important materials for realizing energy&#8208;efficient precombustion CO2 capture during industrial&#8208;scale hydrogen production. However, the promising design of mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) that aims to integrate the molecular&#8208;sieving properties of nanoporous architectures with industrial processable polymers still faces performance and fabrication issues due to the formation of segregated nanofiller domains in their polymer matrices. Here, an unconventional nanocomposite membrane design is proposed using soluble organic macrocyclic cavitands (OMCs) with tunable open cavity sizes that not only mitigate the formation the discrete nanofiller phases but also deliver distinct molecular&#8208;sieving separations. The versatile organic&#8208;solvent solubility coupled with highly interactive functionalities of OMCs allows them to obtain molecularly homogeneous mixing with matrix polymers and form only one integral continuous phase crucial to the robust processability of polymers. A series of polybenzimidazole&#8208;based molecularly mixed composite membranes (MMCMs) are fabricated via the incorporation of a soluble and thermally stable OMC choice, sulfocalixarenes, with various cavity sizes. These membranes achieve outstanding high&#8208;temperature mixed&#8208;gas H2/CO2 separation performances comparable with several state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art molecular&#8208;sieving membranes owing to effective size&#8208;sieving gas passages through the open or partially&#8208;intruded supramolecular cavities. The broadly tunable structures and functionalities of OMCs would make their MMCMs attractive for other energy&#8208;intensive molecular separations.

By adjusting the OMC cavity size within the membranes, tunable gas transport properties can be obtained for highly molecular-sieving H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Processable molecular-sieving membranes are important materials for realizing energy-efficient precombustion CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture during industrial-scale hydrogen production. However, the promising design of mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) that aims to integrate the molecular-sieving properties of nanoporous architectures with industrial processable polymers still faces performance and fabrication issues due to the formation of segregated nanofiller domains in their polymer matrices. Here, an unconventional nanocomposite membrane design is proposed using soluble organic macrocyclic cavitands (OMCs) with tunable open cavity sizes that not only mitigate the formation the discrete nanofiller phases but also deliver distinct molecular-sieving separations. The versatile organic-solvent solubility coupled with highly interactive functionalities of OMCs allows them to obtain molecularly homogeneous mixing with matrix polymers and form only one integral continuous phase crucial to the robust processability of polymers. A series of polybenzimidazole-based molecularly mixed composite membranes (MMCMs) are fabricated via the incorporation of a soluble and thermally stable OMC choice, sulfocalixarenes, with various cavity sizes. These membranes achieve outstanding high-temperature mixed-gas H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separation performances comparable with several state-of-the-art molecular-sieving membranes owing to effective size-sieving gas passages through the open or partially-intruded supramolecular cavities. The broadly tunable structures and functionalities of OMCs would make their MMCMs attractive for other energy-intensive molecular separations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>3D Printed, Solid&#8208;State Conductive Ionoelastomer as a Generic Building Block for Tactile Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fast photocurable, solid&#8208;state conductive ionoelastomer is designed for high&#8208;resolution 3D printing of soft ionic conductor with arbitrary architectures. The printed building blocks display excellent and temperature&#8208;tolerant electrical&#8211;mechanical properties, as well as can be programmed into 3D flexible tactile devices such as gyroid&#8208;based piezoresistive sensor and gap&#8208;based capacitive sensor, both of which exhibit sensitivities much higher than their bulky counterparts.








Abstract
Shaping soft and conductive materials into preferential architectures via 3D printing is highly attractive for numerous applications ranging from tactile devices to bioelectronics. A landmark type of soft and conductive materials is hydrogels/ionogels. However, 3D&#8208;printed hydrogels/ionogels still suffer from a fundamental bottleneck: limited stability in their electrical&#8211;mechanical properties caused by the evaporation and leakage of liquid within hydrogels/ionogels. Although photocurable liquid&#8208;free ion&#8208;conducting elastomers can circumvent these limitations, the associated photocurable process is cumbersome and hence the printing quality is relatively poor. Herein, a fast photocurable, solid&#8208;state conductive ionoelastomer (SCIE) is developed that enables high&#8208;resolution 3D printing of arbitrary architectures. The printed building blocks possess many promising features over the conventional ion&#8208;conducting materials, including high resolution architectures (even &#8776;50&#160;&#181;m overhanging lattices), good Young's modulus (up to &#8776;6.2&#160;MPa), and stretchability (fracture strain of &#8776;292%), excellent conductivity tolerance in a wide range of temperatures (from &#8722;30 to 80&#160;&#176;C), as well as fine elasticity and antifatigue ability even after 10&#160;000 loading&#8211;unloading cycles. It is further demonstrated that the printed building blocks can be programmed into 3D flexible tactile sensors such as gyroid&#8208;based piezoresistive sensor and gap&#8208;based capacitive sensor, both of which exhibit several times higher in sensitivity than their bulky counterparts.

         <title>Bioinspired Quasi&#8208;3D Multiplexed Anti&#8208;Counterfeit Imaging via Self&#8208;Assembled and Nanoimprinted Photonic Architectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A composite lattice photonic crystal architecture can realize polarization&#8208;sensitive multichannel image encodings designed by self&#8208;assembling and nanoimprinting technique. This strategy is low cost, high yield, and scalable, leading to innovative anti&#8208;counterfeiting technology with efficient and handy fabrication.








Abstract
Innovative multiplexing technologies based on nano&#8208;optics for anti&#8208;counterfeiting have been proposed as overt and covert technologies to secure products and make them difficult to counterfeit. However, most of these nano&#8208;optical anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials are metasurfaces and metamaterials with complex and expensive fabrication process, often resulting in materials that are not damage tolerant. Highly efficient anti&#8208;counterfeiting technologies with easy fabrication process are targeted for intuitive and effective authentication of banknotes, secure documents, and goods packing. Here, a simple strategy exploiting self&#8208;assembling and nanoimprinting technique to fabricate a composite lattice photonic crystal architecture featuring full spatial control of light, multiplexed full&#8208;pixel imaging, and multichannel cryptography combined with customized algorithms is reported. In particular, the real&#8208;time encryption/recognition of mobile quick response codes and anti&#8208;counterfeiting labels on a postage stamp, encoded by the proposed photonic architecture, are both demonstrated. The wave optics of scattering, diffraction, and polarization process involved are also described, validated with numerical simulations and experiments. By introducing a new degree of freedom in the 3D space, the multichannel image switching exhibits unprecedented variability of encryption, providing a promising roadmap to achieve larger information capacity, better security, and higher definition for the benefit of modern anti&#8208;counterfeiting security.

         <title>Selective Antisite Defect Formation in WS2 Monolayers via Reactive Growth on Dilute W&#8208;Au Alloy Substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antisite defects in monolayer WS2 are selectively formed with a nonequilibrium synthesis strategy that can reduce their formation energy via W&#8208;poor growth conditions achieved by limiting the available surface W concentration on a W/Au alloy. A high density of SW and S2W antisite defects can be obtained and identified in monolayer WS2 that are sufficient to induce localized defect states in the bandgap.








Abstract
Defects are ubiquitous in 2D materials and can affect the structure and properties of the materials and also introduce new functionalities. Methods to adjust the structure and density of defects during bottom&#8208;up synthesis are required to control the growth of 2D materials with tailored optical and electronic properties. Here, the authors present an Au&#8208;assisted chemical vapor deposition approach to selectively form SW and S2W antisite defects, whereby one or two sulfur atoms substitute for a tungsten atom in WS2 monolayers. Guided by first&#8208;principles calculations, they describe a new method that can maintain tungsten&#8208;poor growth conditions relative to sulfur via the low solubility of W atoms in a gold/W alloy, thereby significantly reducing the formation energy of the antisite defects during the growth of WS2. The atomic structure and composition of the antisite defects are unambiguously identified by Z&#8208;contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy and electron energy&#8208;loss spectroscopy, and their total concentration is statistically determined, with levels up to &#8776;5.0%. Scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy measurements and first&#8208;principles calculations further verified these antisite defects and revealed the localized defect states in the bandgap of WS2 monolayers. This bottom&#8208;up synthesis method to form antisite defects should apply in the synthesis of other 2D materials.

         <title>Fluidic Manipulating of Printable Zinc Oxide for Flexible Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using the optimized n&#8208;propylamine&#8211;zinc oxide electron transporting layer, an organic solar cell with high power conversion efficiency and outstanding stability is achieved.








Abstract
As a representative electron transporting layer in organic solar cells, zinc oxide (ZnO) can be fabricated by the meniscus&#8208;guided coating with the promotion of sol&#8211;gel technology. In order to fabricate stable and flexible organic solar cells (OSCs) based on the printable ZnO layers, here, a new method for simultaneously manipulating fluidics of the sol&#8211;gel ZnO precursor and optimizing processability of the ZnO layer for flexible OSCs is developed. It is found that the Marangoni recirculation in meniscus and the annealing temperature of the sol&#8211;gel ZnO precursor can be effectively modulated by changing the Lewis base. With the use of propylamine, the high&#8208;quality ZnO layer that is suitable for flexible OSCs can be fabricated through blade coating. Under such a condition, the formation of polar facet in ZnO layer is well restrained, which favors the photostability of the cells. As a result, the best 1.00 cm2 flexible cell outputs a power conversion efficiency of 16.71%, which is the best value till now.

         <title>Atomic Visualization and Switching of Ferroelectric Order in &#946;&#8208;In2Se3 Films at the Single Layer Limit</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single layer &#946;&#8242;&#8208; and &#946;*&#8208;In2Se3 films are experimentally validated to host 2D in&#8208;plane anti&#8208;ferroelectric and ferroelectric order, respectively, with structural and spectroscopic evidences characterized by low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)/spectroscopy. An electric field&#8208;induced phase transition is also realized via applying an STM tip pulse, demonstrating the manipulation of the ferroelectric polarization with reversible switching.








Abstract
2D ferroelectrics have received wide interest due to the remarkable quantum states of emerging physics at reduced dimensionality, associated with their exotic properties in high&#8208;performance and nonvolatile functional devices. Here, by combing molecular beam epitaxy synthesis and scanning tunneling microscopy characterization, two metastable phases of layered In2Se3 films: &#946;&#8242;&#8208; and &#946;*&#8208;In2Se3 are reported, which develop different types of in&#8208;plane spontaneous polarizations, thus resulting in different striped morphologies. The anti&#8208;ferroelectric order in &#946;&#8242;&#8208;In2Se3 and ferroelectric order of &#946;*&#8208;In2Se3 are identified, respectively, down to the 2D limit by comprehensive investigations of structural and spectroscopic signatures, including the lattice distortion, the spatial profile of images, the formation of domain structure, and the electronic band&#8208;bending by polarization charges at edges. The ferroelectric switching between those two phases are further controlled via applying an electric field generated from the scanning tunneling microscopy tip in a reversible manner. The intriguing tunability between the (anti&#8208;)ferroelectric orders in the 2D limit provides a promising platform for studying the interplay between electronic structure and ferroelectricity in van der Waals materials, and promotes potential development of miniaturized transistors and memory devices based on electric polarizations.

         <title>Programmable Zwitterionic Droplets as Biomolecular Sorters and Model of Membraneless Organelles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to produce programmable liquid droplets via liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation of associative synthetic polymers is presented. Starting from zwitterionic polymers as reference, different functional groups able to encode multiple intermolecular interactions are introduced in the polymer. In this way, it is possible to simultaneously control multiple mesoscopic properties of the droplets, opening attractive applications in bioseparation and diagnostics.








Abstract
Increasing evidence indicates that cells can regulate biochemical functions in time and space by generating membraneless compartments with well&#8208;defined mesoscopic properties. One important mechanism underlying this control is simple coacervation driven by associative disordered proteins that encode multivalent interactions. Inspired by these observations, programmable droplets based on simple coacervation of responsive synthetic polymers that mimic the &#8220;stickers&#8208;and&#8208;spacers&#8221; architecture of biological disordered proteins are developed. Zwitterionic polymers that undergo an enthalpy&#8208;driven liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation process and form liquid droplets that remarkably exclude most molecules are developed. Starting from this reference material, different functional groups in the zwitterionic polymer are progressively added to encode an increasing number of different intermolecular interactions. This strategy allowed the multiple emerging properties of the droplets to be controlled independently, such as stimulus&#8208;responsiveness, polarity, selective uptake of client molecules, fusion times, and miscibility. By exploiting this high programmability, a model of cellular compartmentalization is reproduced and droplets capable of confining different molecules in space without physical barriers are generated. Moreover, these biomolecular sorters are demonstrated to be able to localize, separate, and enable the detection of target molecules even within complex mixtures, opening attractive applications in bioseparation, and diagnostics.

         <title>Efficient Tandem Quantum&#8208;Dot LEDs Enabled by An Inorganic Semiconductor&#8208;Metal&#8208;Dielectric Interconnecting Layer Stack</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient interconnecting layers (ICLs) are reported consisting of multifunctional inorganic semiconductor&#8208;metal&#8208;dielectric stack, which enables the resultant tandem quantum dot light emitting diodes (QLEDs) with double junction to achieve a record efficiency, with the EQEs of 40% for red, 49% for yellow, 50% for green, and 24% for blue.








Abstract
Light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) in a tandem configuration offer a strategy to realize high&#8208;performance, multicolor devices. Until now, though, the efficiency of tandem colloidal quantum dot LEDs (QLEDs) has been limited due to unpassivated interfaces and solvent damage originating from the materials processing requirements of interconnecting layers (ICLs). Here an ICL is reported consisting of a semiconductor&#8208;metal&#8208;dielectric stack that provides facile fabrication, materials stability, and good optoelectronic coupling. It is investigated experimentally how the ICL enables charge balance, suppresses current leakage, and prevents solvent damage to the underlying layers. As a result record efficiencies are reported for double&#8208;junction tandem QLEDs, whose emission wavelengths cover from blue to red light; i.e., external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 40% (average 37+/&#8722;2%) for red, 49% (average 45+/&#8722;2%) for yellow, 50% (average 46+/&#8722;2%) for green, and 24% (average 21+/&#8722;2%) for blue are achieved.

Abstract
Enzyme immobilization in the confines of microfluidic chips, that promote enzyme activity and stability, has become a powerful strategy to enhance biocatalysis and biomass conversion. Here, based on a newly developed all&#8208;liquid microfluidic chip, fabricated by the interfacial assembly of nanoparticle surfactants in a biphasic system, we&#160;present a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly strategy to generate polysaccharide multilayers on the surface of a microchannel, greatly enhancing the mechanical properties of the microchannel and offering a biocompatible microenvironment for enzyme immobilization. Using horseradish peroxidase and glucose oxidase as model enzymes, all&#8208;liquid microfluidic enzymatic and cascade reactors have been constructed and the crucial role of polysaccharide multilayers on enhancing the enzyme loading and catalytic efficiency is demonstrated.

         <title>Interpolation between W Dopant and Co Vacancy in CoOOH for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interpolation principle between W dopant and Co vacancy with opposite modulation effect is proposed to tune the electronic structure of CoOOH for enhanced oxygen evolution reaction. As a result, near&#8208;optimal electronic states and near&#8208;ideal intermediate energetics are achieved, leading to high catalytic activity. Such an interpolation principle can open up a new methodology for efficient catalyst design.








Abstract
Electronic structure engineering via integrating two defect structures with opposite modulation effects holds the key to fully unlocking the power of a catalyst. Herein, an interpolation principle is proposed to activate CoOOH via W doping and Co vacancies for the oxygen evolution reaction. Density functional theory suggests opposite roles for the W dopant and the Co vacancy but a synergy between them in tuning the electronic states of the Co site, leading to near&#8208;ideal intermediate energetics and dramatically lowered catalytic overpotential. Experimental studies confirm the modulation of the electronic structure and validate the greatly enhanced catalytic activity with a small overpotential of 298.5&#160;mV to drive 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The discovery of the interpolation between dopants and vacancies opens up a new methodology to design efficient catalysts for various electrochemical reactions.

         <title>Low&#8208;Threshold, Highly Stable Colloidal Quantum Dot Short&#8208;Wave Infrared Laser enabled by Suppression of Trap&#8208;Assisted Auger Recombination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A short&#8208;wave infrared single&#8208;mode laser is demonstrated based on PbS colloidal quantum dots (CQDs), which exhibit low threshold and highly&#8208;stable performance owing to suppression of trap&#8208;assisted Auger recombination at supra&#8208;nanocrystalline level. PbS CQDs act as a gain medium where their trap states are electronically passivated by the donated electrons from ZnO nanocrystals.








Abstract
Pb&#8208;chalcogenide colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are attractive materials to be used as tuneable laser media across the infrared spectrum. However, excessive nonradiative Auger recombination due to the presence of trap states outcompetes light amplification by rapidly annihilating the exciton population, leading to high gain thresholds. Here, a binary blend is employed of CQDs and ZnO nanocrystals in order to passivate the in&#8208;gap trap states of PbS&#8208;CQD gain medium. Using transient absorption, a fivefold increase is measured in Auger lifetime demonstrating the suppression of trap&#8208;assisted Auger recombination. By doing so, a twofold reduction is achieved in amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) threshold. Finally, by integrating the proposed binary blend to a distributed feedback (DFB) resonator, single&#8208;mode lasing emission is demonstrated at 1650&#160;nm with a linewidth of 1.23&#160;nm (0.62 meV), operating at a low lasing threshold of &#8776;385 &#956;J cm&#8211;2. The Auger suppression in this system has allowed to achieve unprecedented lasing emission stability for a CQD laser with recorded continuous operation of 5 h at room temperature and ambient conditions.

         <title>Free&#8208;standing Nanofilm Electrode Arrays for Long&#8208;term Stable Neural Interfacings</title>

Abstract
Flexible neural electrodes integrated on micrometer&#8208;thick polymer substrates offer important opportunities for improving the stability of neuronal activity recordings during cognitive processes. However, the bending stiffness of micrometer&#8208;thick polymer substrates is typically two orders of magnitude higher than that of nanofilm electrodes, making it a limiting factor in electrode&#8208;tissue interfacings. Here, we overcome this limitation by developing self&#8208;assembled nanofilm electrode arrays (NEAs) that consist of high&#8208;density, free&#8208;standing gold nanofilm electrodes. Chronically implanted NEAs can form intimate and innervated interfaces with neural tissue, enabling stable neuronal activity recordings across multiple brain regions over several months. As an application example, we track the activities of the same neuronal populations across odor discrimination reversal learning and illustrate how dorsal striatal neurons represent and update stimulus&#8208;outcome associations across multiple timescales. Our results underscore the potential of free&#8208;standing nanoscale materials for interfacing biological systems over long terms.

         <title>A Tri&#8208;Channel Oxide Transistor Concept for the Rapid Detection of Biomolecules Including the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Spike Protein</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solution&#8208;processed metal oxide heterojunction channel with a geometrically engineered tri&#8208;channel architecture several millimeters in size, is developed and used as a generic platform for robust, selective, and ultrasensitive detection of various biomolecules. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, selective sensing of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein down to attomolar concentrations in under 2 min is demonstrated.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state transistor sensors that can detect biomolecules in real time are highly attractive for emerging bioanalytical applications. However, combining upscalable manufacturing with the required performance remains challenging. Here, an alternative biosensor transistor concept is developed, which relies on a solution&#8208;processed In2O3/ZnO semiconducting heterojunction featuring a geometrically engineered tri&#8208;channel architecture for the rapid, real&#8208;time detection of important biomolecules. The sensor combines a high electron mobility channel, attributed to the electronic properties of the In2O3/ZnO heterointerface, in close proximity to a sensing surface featuring tethered analyte receptors. The unusual tri&#8208;channel design enables strong coupling between the buried electron channel and electrostatic perturbations occurring during receptor&#8211;analyte interactions allowing for robust, real&#8208;time detection of biomolecules down to attomolar (am) concentrations. The experimental findings are corroborated by extensive device simulations, highlighting the unique advantages of the heterojunction tri&#8208;channel design. By functionalizing the surface of the geometrically engineered channel with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) antibody receptors, real&#8208;time detection of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike S1 protein down to am concentrations is demonstrated in under 2 min in physiological relevant conditions.

         <title>Highly Stiff and Stretchable DNA Liquid Crystalline Organogels with Super Plasticity, Ultrafast Self&#8208;Healing, and Magnetic Response Behaviors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of DNA soft material driven by supramolecular interactions has been developed. Exceptional stretchability, deformability, plasticity, and ultrafast self&#8208;healing property have been observed due to the formed internal mesophase ordering. Moreover, the DNA&#8208;based liquid crystalline organogels exhibit impressive ultimate tensile strengths and stiffness, rendering the materials the strongest among reported DNA networks.








Abstract
DNA&#8208;based gels are attractive materials as they allow intuitive rational design, respond to external physicochemical stimuli, and show great potential for biomedical applications. However, their relatively poor mechanical properties currently limit their technological application considerably as the latter requires mechanical integrity and tunability. With this work, a DNA organogel is reported that gels through supramolecular interactions, which induce mesophase ordering, and that exhibits exceptional stretchability, deformability, plasticity, and biocompatibility. Moreover, the nature of the supramolecular bond enables complete self&#8208;healing within 3 s. Most importantly, the DNA&#8208;based liquid crystalline organogels exhibit impressive ultimate tensile strengths above 1&#160;MPa, stiffness higher than 20&#160;MPa, and toughness up to 18&#160;MJ m&#8722;3, rendering these materials the strongest among reported DNA networks. In addition, the facile access is demonstrated to composite DNA materials by blending magnetic nanoparticles with the organogel matrix giving access to magnetic field induced actuation. It is believed that these findings contribute significantly to the advancement of DNA gels for their use in smart materials and biomedical applications.

Abstract
Organic electrode materials free of rare transition metal elements are promising for sustainable, cost&#8208;effective and environmentally benign battery chemistries. However, severe shuttling effect caused by the dissolution of active materials in liquid electrolytes results in fast capacity decay, limiting their practical applications. Here, using a gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) that is in situ formed on Nafion&#8208;coated separators, we eliminate the shuttle reaction of organic electrodes while maintaining the electrochemical performance. The synergy of physical confinement by GPE with tunable polymer structure and charge repulsion of the Nafion&#8208;coated separator substantially prevented the soluble organic electrode materials with different molecular sizes from shuttling. A soluble small&#8208;molecule organic electrode material of 1,3,5&#8208;tri(9,10&#8208;anthraquinonyl)benzene demonstrates exceptional electrochemical performance with an ultra&#8208;long cycle life of 10,000 cycles, excellent rate capability of 203 mAh g&#8722;1 at 100C and a wide working temperature range from &#8208;70 to 100&#160;&#176;C based on the solid&#8208;liquid conversion chemistry, which outperforms all previously reported organic cathode materials. The shielding capability of GPE can be designed and tailored towards organic electrodes with different molecular sizes, thus providing a universal resolution to the shuttling effect that all soluble electrode materials suffer.

         <title>Electronically and Geometrically Modified Single&#8208;Atom Fe Sites by Adjacent Fe NPs for Enhanced Oxygen Reduction</title>

Abstract
Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C materials exhibit excellent activity and stability for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), as one of the most promising candidates to replace the commercial Pt/C catalysts. However, it is challenging to unravel the features of the superior ORR activity originated from Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C materials. In this work, the correlations between the electronic and geometric structures about the isolated Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C sites including the corresponding ORR activities are investigated by varying the secondary thermal activation temperature of a rationally designed NC&#8208;supported Fe single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC). The systematic analyses demonstrate the significant role of coordinated atoms of SA and metallic Fe nanoparticles (NPs) in altering the electronic structure of isolated Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C sites. Meanwhile, the strong interaction between isolated Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C sites and adjacent Fe NPs can change the geometric structure of isolated Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C sites. Theoretical calculations reveal that optimal regulation of the electronic and geometric structure of isolated Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C sites by the co&#8208;existence of Fe NPs narrows the energy barriers of the rate&#8208;limiting steps of ORR, resulting in outstanding ORR performance. This work not only provides the fundamental understanding of the underlying structure&#8208;activity relationship, but also sheds light on designing efficient Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts.

&lt;p&gt;Fe-N-C materials exhibit excellent activity and stability for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), as one of the most promising candidates to replace the commercial Pt/C catalysts. However, it is challenging to unravel the features of the superior ORR activity originated from Fe-N-C materials. In this work, the correlations between the electronic and geometric structures about the isolated Fe-N-C sites including the corresponding ORR activities are investigated by varying the secondary thermal activation temperature of a rationally designed NC-supported Fe single-atom catalyst (SAC). The systematic analyses demonstrate the significant role of coordinated atoms of SA and metallic Fe nanoparticles (NPs) in altering the electronic structure of isolated Fe-N-C sites. Meanwhile, the strong interaction between isolated Fe-N-C sites and adjacent Fe NPs can change the geometric structure of isolated Fe-N-C sites. Theoretical calculations reveal that optimal regulation of the electronic and geometric structure of isolated Fe-N-C sites by the co-existence of Fe NPs narrows the energy barriers of the rate-limiting steps of ORR, resulting in outstanding ORR performance. This work not only provides the fundamental understanding of the underlying structure-activity relationship, but also sheds light on designing efficient Fe-N-C catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Ultrahigh&#8208;Performance Optoelectronic Skin Based on Intrinsically Stretchable Perovskite&#8208;Polymer Heterojunction Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Optoelectronic skin is acknowledged as the world current cutting&#8208;edge technology in the fields of wearable healthcare monitoring, soft robotics, artificial retinas, and so on. However, the difficulty in preparing stretchable photosensitive polymers and the high&#8208;crystallization nature of most reported photosensitive materials (such as perovskites) severely restrict the development of skin&#8208;like optoelectronic devices. Herein, a surface energy&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly methodology is proposed to form easily transferrable and flexible perovskite quantum dot (PQD) films with a worm&#8208;like morphology. Furthermore, intrinsically stretchable phototransistors (ISTPTs) are fabricated based on an stretchable photosensitive layer heterojunction consisting of the worm&#8208;like PQD films and hybrid polymer semiconductors. The obtained ISTPTs display highly sensitive response to high&#8208;energy photons of X&#8208;ray (with a detection limit of 79 nGy s&#8211;1, that is 560 times lower than commercial medical chest X&#8208;ray diagnosis) and ultraviolet (with photosensitivity of 5 &#215; 106 and detectable light intensity of 50 nW cm&#8211;2 among the highest performance of reported photodetectors). In addition, these ISTPTs demonstrate desirable e&#8208;skin characteristics with high strain tolerance, high sensing specificity, high optical transparency, and desirable skin conformability. The surface energy&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly methodology for the preparation of ISTPTs is a critical demonstration to enable low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance optoelectronic skins.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;high Molecular Weight Polyethylene Lamellar&#8208;thin Framework on Square Meter Scale</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
A new member of low&#8208;dimensional structures with a high aspect ratio (LDHA) is introduced. For the first time, commodity polymer was processed into LDHA, which has long been stagnated by the lack of suitable processing techniques. The key to solve the current bottleneck is to overcome the trade&#8208;off between kinetic processability and thermodynamic stability. These two factors are both highly determined by intermolecular interaction level (IIL). Thus with a wide tuning range of IIL, ultra&#8208;high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) was selected and investigated to break through the trade&#8208;off. Polymeric LDHA preparation needs both thinning and stiffening. By focusing on one then the other sequentially, they were realized simultaneously. Thus the over sixty&#8208;year&#8208;old material was finally thinned down by seven orders of magnitude into a 65.5&#160;nm thick and 0.64 m2 large lamellar&#8208;thin framework (LTF). LTF exhibits a series of exceptional properties such as over&#8208;95% transparency, and seven times higher specific strength referred to steel. For the first time, cryogenic electron microscopy (Cryo&#8208;EM) was utilized to observe commodity polymers directly. We believe this new LDHA material is promising to expand the scale boundaries of both fundamental research and practical applications, not only for UHMWPE, but also for more commodity polymers to come.

         <title>Efficiency of Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Sensitized Triplet Upconversion Doubled in Three&#8208;Component System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
As in many fields, the most exciting endeavors in photon upconversion research focus on increasing the efficiency (upconversion quantum yield) and performance (anti&#8208;Stokes shift) while diminishing the cost of production. In this vein, studies employing metal&#8208;free thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) sensitizers have garnered increased interest. Here, for the first time, the strategy of ternary photon upconversion was utilized with the TADF sensitizer 4CzIPN, resulting in a doubling of the upconversion quantum yield in comparison to the binary system employing p&#8208;terphenyl as the emitter. In this ternary blend, the sensitizer 4CzIPN is paired with an intermediate acceptor, 1&#8208;methylnaphthalene, in addition to the emitter molecule, p&#8208;terphenyl yielding a normalized upconversion quantum yield of 7.6% while maintaining the 0.83&#160;eV anti&#8208;Stokes shift. These results illustrate the potential benefits of utilizing this strategy of energy&#8208;funneling, previously used only with heavy&#8208;metal based sensitizers, to increase the performance of these photon upconversion systems.

         <title>Magnetic field&#8208;switchable Laser Via Optical Pumping of Rubrene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Volumetric optical imaging of magnetic fields is challenging with existing magneto&#8208;optical materials, motivating the search for dyes with strong magnetic field interactions, distinct emission spectra, and an ability to withstand high photon flux and incorporation within samples. Here, the magnetic field effect on singlet exciton fission is exploited to demonstrate spatial imaging of magnetic fields in a thin film of rubrene. Doping rubrene with the high&#8208;quantum yield dye dibenzotetraphenylperiflanthene (DBP) is shown to enable optically&#8208;pumped, slab waveguide lasing. This laser is magnetic field&#8208;switchable: when operated just below lasing threshold, application of a 0.4 T magnetic field switches the device between non&#8208;lasing and lasing modes, accompanied by an intensity modulation of +360%. To the best of authors&#8217; knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a magnetically&#8208;switchable laser, as well as the largest magnetically&#8208;induced change in emission brightness in a singlet fission material to date. These results demonstrate that singlet fission materials are promising materials for magnetic sensing applications and could inspire a new class of magneto&#8208;optical modulators.

         <title>Direct&#8208;Bandgap Bilayer WSe2/Microsphere Monolithic Cavity for Low&#8208;Threshold Lasing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD)/cavity monolithic cavity is achieved by directly growing single&#8208;domain tungsten diselenide (WSe2) bilayers on single silica microsphere (MS) surfaces. The thermal strain induces bilayer bandgap from indirect to direct, and the cavity confinement factor is also improved, which directly realizes room&#8208;temperature whispering&#8208;gallery&#8208;mode lasing, with a threshold nearly an order of magnitude lower than the existing records.








Abstract
Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have emerged as widely accepted 2D gain materials in the field of light sources owing to their direct bandgap and high photoluminescence quantum yield. However, the monolayer medium suffers from weak emission because only a single layer of molecules can absorb the pump energy. Moreover, the material degradation when transferring these fragile materials hinders their cooperation with the optical cavity further. In this study, for the first time, a high&#8208;quality monolithic structure is developed by directly growing single&#8208;domain tungsten diselenide (WSe2) bilayers on single silica microsphere (MS) cavities. Such a completely wrapped structure guides the indirect&#8208;to&#8208;direct bandgap transition of WSe2 bilayers, leading to a significantly improved photoluminescence intensity by about 60&#8208;fold. Moreover, the high&#8208;quality monolithic structure enhances the confinement factor of the cavity by more than 20&#8208;fold. Based on the above advantages, a bilayer WSe2/MS microlaser is realized with an ultralow threshold of 0.72 W&#160;cm&#8722;2, nearly an order of magnitude lower than the existing records. The results demonstrate the possibility of using multilayer TMD materials as 2D gain media and provide insights into a new ultracompact monolithic platform of TMD material/cavity for lasing devices.

         <title>Roll&#8208;to&#8208;Roll Dry Transfer of Large&#8208;Scale Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll process is developed for dry transfer of large&#8208;scale graphene. With peeling speed and tension control, surface resistance of 9.5 k&#937;&#160;sq&#8722;1 is achieved on polyethylene terephthalate/ethylene vinyl acetate, allowing the fabrication of flexible graphene&#8208;based field effect transistors with 100 times lower gate leakage current and near&#8208;zero doping level compared with those fabricated using wet etched graphene samples.








Abstract
A major challenge for graphene applications is the lack of mass production technology for large&#8208;scale and high&#8208;quality graphene growth and transfer. Here, a roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll (R2R) dry transfer process for large&#8208;scale graphene grown by chemical vapor deposition is reported. The process is fast, controllable, and environmentally benign. It avoids chemical contamination and allows the reuse of graphene growth substrates. By controlling tension and speed of the R2R dry transfer process, the electrical sheet resistance is achieved as 9.5 k&#937;&#160;sq&#8722;1, the lowest ever reported among R2R dry transferred graphene samples. The R2R dry transferred samples are used to fabricate graphene&#8208;based field&#8208;effect transistors (GFETs) on polymer. It is demonstrated that these flexible GFETs feature a near&#8208;zero doping level and a gate leakage current one to two orders of magnitude lower than those fabricated using wet&#8208;chemical etched graphene samples. The scalability and uniformity of the R2R dry transferred graphene is further demonstrated by successfully transferring a 3 &#215; 3&#160;in2 sample and measuring its field&#8208;effect mobility with 36 millimeter&#8208;scaled GFETs evenly spaced on the sample. The field&#8208;effect mobility of the R2R dry transferred graphene is determined to be 205 &#177; 36&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1.

         <title>Dual Tumor Microenvironment Remodeling by Glucose&#8208;Contained Radical Copolymer for MRI&#8208;Guided Photoimmunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents new insights on CUDC101 in the reprogramming of tumor&#8208;associated macrophages toward antitumor M1 phenotype by CD47 inhibition with a glucose&#8208;contained magnetic resonance imaging&#8208;capable supramolecular rod&#8208;like micelle, and phototriggered p53 by codelivery of IR780 can achieve the synergistic effect in the transition from cold immunosuppressive to hot immunoresponsive tumor microenvironment.








Abstract
Aberrant glucose metabolism and immune evasion are recognized as two hallmarks of cancer, which contribute to poor treatment efficiency and tumor progression. Herein, a novel material system consisting of a glucose and TEMPO (2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;yl)oxyl) at the distal ends of PEO&#8208;b&#8208;PLLA block copolymer (glucose&#8208;PEO&#8208;b&#8208;PLLA&#8208;TEMPO), is designed to encapsulate clinical therapeutics CUDC101 and photosensitizer IR780. The specific core&#8211;shell rod structure formed by the designed copolymer renders TEMPO radicals excellent stability against reduction&#8208;induced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) silence. Tumor&#8208;targeting moiety endowed by glucose provides the radical copolymer outstanding multimodal imaging capabilities, including MRI, photoacoustic imaging, and fluorescence imaging. Efficient delivery of CUDC101 and IR780 is achieved to synergize the antitumor immune activation through IR780&#8208;mediated photodynamic therapy (PDT) and CUDC101&#8208;triggered CD47 inhibition, showing M1 phenotype polarization of tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs). More intriguingly, this study demonstrates PDT&#8208;stimulated p53 can also re&#8208;educate TAMs, providing a combined strategy of using dual tumor microenvironment remodeling to achieve the synergistic effect in the transition from cold immunosuppressive to hot immunoresponsive tumor microenvironment.

         <title>Construction of Interfacial Electric Field via Dual&#8208;Porphyrin Heterostructure Boosting Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strong interfacial electric field is constructed through the dual&#8208;porphyrin heterostructure of tetrakis (4&#8208;carboxyphenyl) zinc porphyrin (ZnTCPP)/tetrakis (4&#8208;hydroxyphenyl) porphyrin (THPP), which greatly promotes charge separation and transfer. Meanwhile, dual porphyrins possess proper interface match to reduce recombination sites of interface charge carriers. Consequently, ZnTCPP/THPP exhibits an excellent photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of 41.4&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1, exceeding most of the reported photocatalysts.








Abstract
A dual&#8208;porphyrin heterostructure is successfully constructed by coupling tetrakis (4&#8208;carboxyphenyl) zinc porphyrin (ZnTCPP) with tetrakis (4&#8208;hydroxyphenyl) porphyrin (THPP). The high photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of 41.4&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 is obtained for ZnTCPP/THPP under full spectrum, which is &#8776;5.1 and &#8776;17.0 times higher than that of pure ZnTCPP and THPP, respectively. The significantly enhanced activity is mainly attributed to the giant interfacial electric field formed between dual porphyrins, which greatly facilitates efficient charge separation and transfer. Meanwhile, similar conjugated structures of dual porphyrins also provide proper interface match and decrease interface defects, thus inhibiting the recombination of photoproduced carriers. By rationally combining the appropriate band structures and high&#8208;quality interfacial contact of dual porphyrins, this work provides a fresh insight into the interfacial electric field construction to improve the photocatalytic performance.

         <title>Hierarchically Porous Silica Membrane as Separator for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembled arrays of closely&#8208;packed hollow mesoporous silica (HMS) particles on the cathode surface can serve as ultralight, mechanically robust, and thermally stable separators for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Thanks to their inorganic nature and hierarchically porous structure, the HMS separators display higher electrolyte affinity and ionic conductivity compared to commercial polypropylene separators, endowing LIBs with exceptional rate capability and cycling stability.








Abstract
Commercial polymeric separators in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) typically suffer from limited porosity, low electrolyte wettability, and poor thermal and mechanical stability, which can degrade the battery performance especially at high current densities. Here, the design of hierarchically porous, ultralight silica membranes as separator for high&#8208;performance LIBs is reported through the assembly of hollow mesoporous silica (HMS) particles on the cathode surface.

     alt="Hierarchically Porous Silica Membrane as Separator for High-Performance Lithium-Ion Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-assembled arrays of closely-packed hollow mesoporous silica (HMS) particles on the cathode surface can serve as ultralight, mechanically robust, and thermally stable separators for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Thanks to their inorganic nature and hierarchically porous structure, the HMS separators display higher electrolyte affinity and ionic conductivity compared to commercial polypropylene separators, endowing LIBs with exceptional rate capability and cycling stability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commercial polymeric separators in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) typically suffer from limited porosity, low electrolyte wettability, and poor thermal and mechanical stability, which can degrade the battery performance especially at high current densities. Here, the design of hierarchically porous, ultralight silica membranes as separator for high-performance LIBs is reported through the assembly of hollow mesoporous silica (HMS) particles on the cathode surface. The rich mesopores and large cavity of individual HMS particles provide low-tortuosity pathways for ionic transport, while simultaneously serving as electrolyte reservoir to further boost the electrochemical kinetics. Moreover, benefiting from their inorganic and hierarchically porous nature, such HMS separators display better electrolyte affinity, thermal stability, and mechanical strength than commercial polypropylene (PP) separators. As a demonstration, LIBs with a LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; cathode coated with HMS separators exhibit exceptional rate capability and cycling stability, outperforming LIBs with PP and Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-modified PP separators as well as separators made of solid silica particles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Strong Metal Phosphide&#8208;Phosphate Support Interaction for Enhanced Non&#8208;noble Metal Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) is crucial for supported catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis. Here is the first report on strong metal phosphide&#8208;phosphate support interaction (SMPSI). The key to SMPSI is the activation of P species on the support, which leads to simultaneously generate of metal phosphide NPs and core&#8208;shell nanostructures formed by support migration onto the NPs. The encapsulation state of metal phosphide and charge transfer are identical to those of classical SMSIs and can be optimally regulated. Furthermore, the strong interactions of Co2PL/MnP&#8208;3 not only significantly enhance the anti&#8208;oxidation and anti&#8208;acid capability of non&#8208;noble metal but also exhibit excellent catalytic activity and stability toward hydrogenating a wide range of compounds into value&#8208;added fine chemicals with 100% selectivity, which is even better than Pd/C and Pt/C. The SMPSI construction can be generally extended to other systems such as Ni2PL/Mn3(PO4)2, Co2PL/LaPO4, and CoPL/CePO4. This study provides a new approach for the rational design of advanced non&#8208;noble metal catalysts and introduce a novel paradigm for the strong interaction between NPs and support.

         <title>Ionic Crosslinking&#8208;Induced Nanochannels: Nanophase Separation for Ion Transport Promotion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A membrane is fabricated by ionic crosslinking sulfonated poly(arylene ether ketone) and imidazolium&#8208;functionalized poly(arylene ether sulfone) to aggregate the ion pathways in the membrane through nanophase separation, which results in excellent ion selectivity and high ion conductivity. This membrane shows great potential in osmotic energy conversion, which maximum power density can be up to 16.72 W m&#8722;2.








Abstract
Charge&#8208;governed ion transport is crucial to numerous industries, and the advanced membrane is the essential component. In nature, the efficient and selective ion transport is mainly governed by the charged ion channels located in cell membrane, indicating the architecture with functional differentiation. Inspired by this architecture, a membrane by ionic crosslinking sulfonated poly(arylene ether ketone) and imidazolium&#8208;functionalized poly(arylene ether sulfone) is designed and fabricated to make full use of the charges. This ionic crosslinking is designed to realize nanophase separation to aggregate the ion pathways in the membrane, which results in excellent ion selectivity and high ion conductivity. With the excellent ion transport behavior, ionic crosslinking membrane shows great potential in osmotic energy conversion, which maximum power density can be up to 16.72 W m&#8722;2. This design of ionic crosslinking&#8208;induced nanophase separation offers a roadmap for ion transport promotion.

         <title>In&#8208;Memory Realization of Eligibility Traces Based on Conductance Drift of Phase Change Memory for Energy&#8208;Efficient Reinforcement Learning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown outstanding performance in handling complex tasks in recent years. Eligibility trace (ET), a fundamental and important mechanism in reinforcement learning, records critical states with attenuation and guides the update of policy, which plays a crucial role in accelerating the convergence of RL training. However, ET implementation on conventional digital computing hardware is energy hungry and restricted by the memory wall due to massive calculation of exponential decay functions. Here, we demonstrate in&#8208;memory realization of ET for energy&#8208;efficient reinforcement learning with outstanding performance in discrete&#8208; and continuous&#8208;state RL tasks. For the first time, the inherent conductance drift of phase change memory is exploited as physical decay function to realize in&#8208;memory eligibility trace, demonstrating excellent performance during RL training in various tasks. The spontaneous in&#8208;memory decay computing and storage of policy in the same phase change memory give rise to significantly enhanced energy efficiency compared with traditional graphics processing unit platforms. Our work therefore provides a holistic energy and hardware efficient method for both training and inference of reinforcement learning.

         <title>Controlling and Focusing in&#8208;plane Hyperbolic Phonon Polaritons in &#945;&#8208;MoO3 with A Curved Plasmonic Antenna</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hyperbolic phonon polaritons (HPhPs) sustained in polar van der Waals (vdW) crystals exhibit extraordinary confinement of long&#8208;wave electromagnetic fields to the deep subwavelength scale. In stark contrast to uniaxial vdW hyperbolic materials, recently emerged biaxial hyperbolic materials, such as &#945;&#8208;MoO3 and &#945;&#8208;V2O5, offer new degrees of freedom for controlling light in two&#8208;dimension due to their distinctive in&#8208;plane hyperbolic dispersions. However, the control and focusing of these in&#8208;plane HPhPs remain elusive. Here, we propose a versatile technique for launching, controlling, and focusing in&#8208;plane HPhPs in &#945;&#8208;MoO3 with geometrically designed curved gold plasmonic antennas. We find that the subwavelength manipulation and focusing behaviors are strongly dependent on the curvature of the antenna extremity. This strategy operates effectively in a broadband spectral region. These findings not only provide fundamental insights into the manipulation of light by biaxial hyperbolic crystals at the nanoscale but also open up new opportunities for planar nanophotonic applications.

         <title>Functionalizing Framework Nucleic Acid&#8208;Based Nanostructures for Biomedical Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Strategies for functionalizing diverse tetrahedral framework nucleic acids (tFNAs) have been extensively explored since the first successful fabrication of tFNA by Turberfield. One&#8208;pot annealing of at least four DNA single strands is the most common method to prepare tFNA, as it optimizes the cost, yield, and speed of assembly. This review concentrates on four key merits of tFNAs and their potential for biomedical applications. The natural ability of tFNA to scavenge reactive oxygen species, along with remarkable enhancement in cellular endocytosis and tissue permeability based on its appropriate size and geometry, promotes cell&#8208;material interaction to direct or probe cell behavior, especially to treat inflammatory and degenerative diseases. Moreover, the structural programmability of tFNA enables the development of static tFNA&#8208;based nanomaterials via engineering of functional oligonucleotides or therapeutic molecules, and dynamic tFNAs via attachment of stimuli&#8208;responsive DNA apparatuses, leading to potentially applications in targeted therapies, tissue regeneration, antitumor strategies, and antibacterial treatment. Although there are impressive performance and significant progress, challenges and prospects of functionalizing tFNA&#8208;based nanostructures are still indicated in this review.

Abstract
Noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free, durable and high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction and evolution reaction (ORR/OER) are vital for rechargeable Zn&#8208;air batteries (ZABs). Herein, a flexible and free&#8208;standing carbon fiber membrane immobilized with atomically dispersed Fe&#8208;N4/C catalysts (Fe/SNCFs&#8208;NH3) is synthesized and used as air cathode for ZABs. The intertwined carbon fibers with hierarchical nanopores facilitate the gas transportation, electrolyte infiltration and electron transfer. The larger specific surface area after NH3 activation exposes a high concentration of Fe&#8208;N4/C sites that embedded in the carbon matrix. Modulation of local atomic configurations by sulfur doping in Fe/SNCFs&#8208;NH3 catalyst leads to excellent ORR and enhanced OER activities. As&#8208;synthesized Fe/SNCFs&#8208;NH3 catalyst demonstrates a positive half&#8208;wave potential of 0.89&#160;V and a small Tafel slope of 70.82&#160;mV dec&#8211;1, outperforming the commercial Pt/C (0.86&#160;V/94.74&#160;mV dec&#8211;1) and most reported M&#8208;Nx/C (M = Fe, Co, Ni) catalysts. Experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations uncover the crucial role of S doping in regulating ORR and OER activity. The liquid&#8208;state ZABs with Fe/SNCFs&#8208;NH3 catalyst as air cathode deliver a large peak power density of 255.84&#160;mW cm&#8211;2 and a long&#8208;term cycle durability over 1000 h. Solid&#8208;state ZAB shows stable cycling at various flat/bent/flat states, demonstrating great prospects in portable and wearable device applications.

         <title>Conjugated Polymer Mesocrystals with Structural and Optoelectronic Coherence and Anisotropy in Three Dimensions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semiconducting mesocrystalline bulk polymer specimens are demonstrated exhibiting near&#8208;intrinsic properties using channel&#8208;die pressing. Predominant edge&#8208;on orientation is obtained for hole&#8208; and electron&#8208;transporting polymer semicnductors throughout 2 mm&#8208;thick/wide samples. This persistent mesocrystalline arrangement at macroscopic scales allows reliable evaluation of the electronic charge&#8208;transport anisotropy predicted along all three crystallographic axes, without the need to grow single crystals.








Abstract
Semiconducting mesocrystalline bulk polymer specimens that exhibit near&#8208;intrinsic properties using channel&#8208;die pressing are demonstrated. A predominant edge&#8208;on orientation is obtained for poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene&#8208;2,5&#8208;diyl) (P3HT) throughout 2 mm&#8208;thick/wide samples. This persistent mesocrystalline arrangement at macroscopic scales allows reliable evaluation of the electronic charge&#8208;transport anisotropy along all three crystallographic axes, with high mobilities found along the &#960;&#8208;stacking. Indeed, charge&#8208;carrier mobilities of up to 2.3 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 are measured along the &#960;&#8208;stack, which are some of the highest mobilities reported for polymers at low charge&#8208;carrier densities (drop&#8208;cast films display mobilities of maximum &#8776;10&#8722;3 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1). The structural coherence also leads to an unusually well&#8208;defined photoluminescence line&#8208;shape characteristic of an H&#8208;aggregate (measured from the surface perpendicular to the materials flow), rather than the typical HJ&#8208;aggregate feature usually found for P3HT. The approach is widely applicable: to electrical conductors and materials used in n&#8208;type devices, such as poly{[N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(2&#8208;octyldodecyl)&#8208;naphthalene&#8208;1,4,5,8&#8208;bis(dicarboximide)&#8208;2,6&#8208;diyl]&#8208;alt&#8208;5,5&#8242;&#8208;(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bithiophene)} (N2200) where the mesocrystalline structure leads to high electron transport along the polymer backbones (&#8776;1.3 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1). This versatility and the broad applicability of channel&#8208;die pressing signifies its promise as a straightforward, readily scalable method to fabricate bulk semiconducting polymer structures at macroscopic scales with properties typically accessible only by the tedious growth of single crystals.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting White Light Printed Image Multiplexing by Fast Nanosecond Laser Processing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Up to four images are encoded in a single random plasmonic metasurface created by fast nanosecond laser processing. Each laser&#8208;induced pixel exhibits various colors in different observation modes, which can be controlled independently to enable multiplexing. The approach, different from holography, makes possible the observation of various images on the same support by the naked eye under different observation angles.








Abstract
Passive plasmonic metasurfaces enable image multiplexing by displaying different images when altering the conditions of observation. Under white light, three&#8208;image multiplexing with polarization&#8208;selective switching has been recently demonstrated using femtosecond&#8208;laser&#8208;processed random plasmonic metasurfaces. Here, the implementation of image multiplexing is extended, thanks to a color&#8208;search algorithm, to various observation modes compatible with naked&#8208;eye observation under incoherent white light and to four&#8208;image multiplexing under polarized light. The laser&#8208;processed random plasmonic metasurfaces enabling image multiplexing exhibit self&#8208;organized patterns that can diffract light or induce dichroism through hybridization between the localized surface plasmon resonance of metallic nanoparticles and a lattice resonance. Improved spatial resolution makes the image quality compatible with commercial use in secured documents as well as the processing time and cost thanks to the use of a nanosecond laser. This high&#8208;speed and flexible laser process, based on energy&#8208;efficient nanoparticle reshaping and self&#8208;organization, produces centimeter&#8208;scale customized tamper&#8208;proof images at low cost, which can serve as overt security features.

         <title>Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Cathode with Dual Energy Storage Mechanism for Ultra&#8208;High&#8208;Rate and Ultra&#8208;Long&#8208;Life Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

Abstract
The exploitation of cathode materials with high capacity as well as high operating voltage is extremely important for the development of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs). Yet the classical high&#8208;capacity materials (e.g., vanadium&#8208;based materials) provide a low discharge voltage, while organic cathodes with high operating voltage generally suffer from a low capacity. Herein, we design the organic (ethylenediamine) &#8208; inorganic (vanadium oxide) hybrid cathodes, i.e., EDA&#8208;VO, with dual energy storage mechanism for ultra&#8208;high&#8208;rate and ultra&#8208;long&#8208;life ZIBs. The embedded ethylenediamine (EDA) can not only increase the layered spacing of vanadium oxide with improved mobility of Zn ions in V&#8208;O layered structure, but also as a bidentate chelating ligand participating in the storage of Zn ions. This hybrid provides a high specific capacity (382&#160;mA h g&#8208;1 at 0.5 A g&#8208;1), elevated voltage (0.82&#160;V) and excellent long&#8208;term cycle stability (over 10,000 cycles at 5 A g&#8208;1). Assistant density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate the cathode has remarkably electronic conductivity, with an ultralow diffusion barrier of 0.78&#160;eV for optimal Zn ions diffusion path in EDA&#8208;VO. This interesting idea of building organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid cathode materials with dual energy storage mechanism opens the new research direction towards the high&#8208;energy secondary batteries.

         <title>Covalent&#8208;Linking Enabled Superior Compatibility of ZIF&#8208;8 Hybrid Membrane for Efficient Propylene Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The interface is a critical issue for metal organic frameworks hybrid membranes in propylene separation. Here, the covalent&#8208;linking strategy is reported for strikingly reinforcing the interfacial compatibility in a ZIF&#8208;8 based membrane. A functionalized ZIF&#8208;8 material named as ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;CN is firstly synthesized using the mixed&#8208;ligand approach.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interface is a critical issue for metal organic frameworks hybrid membranes in propylene separation. Here, the covalent-linking strategy is reported for strikingly reinforcing the interfacial compatibility in a ZIF-8 based membrane. A functionalized ZIF-8 material named as ZIF-8-CN is firstly synthesized using the mixed-ligand approach. ZIF-8-CN owns identical crystalline structure to ZIF-8 and 4,5-dicyanoimidazole ligand available for further functionalization. Covalent linkage of ZIF-8-CN with PIM-1 is driven by thermal reaction of cyano groups on both entities, which strengthens the filler-polymer connection in the ZIF-8-CN@tPIM-1 membrane. ZIF-8-CN@tPIM-1 exhibits remarkably enhanced propylene permeation property with C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity of &#8764;28, which is 350% and 180% higher than those on non-treated ZIF-8-CN/PIM-1 and non-functionalized ZIF-8@tPIM-1, respectively. Additionally, ZIF-8-CN@tPIM-1 shows the highest C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; permeability of &#8764;370 Barrer among all relevant ZIF-8 membranes. This strategy opens an avenue for precise interface engineering in membranes and resultant high performance is appealing in propylene separation industry.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>In Situ Architecting Endogenous Heterojunction of MoS2 Coupling with Mo2CTx MXenes for Optimized Li+ Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Endogenous heterojunction of 2D MXenes with unique structure shows inspiring potential in energy applications, which is impeded by complex synthesis method and finite MAX materials. Herein, an in situ hydrothermal strategy is implemented to successfully synthesize unique endogenous hetero&#8208;MXenes of amorphous MoS2 coupling with fluoride&#8208;free Mo2CTx directly from Mo2Ga2C MAX. The distinctive morphology and heterojunction structure caused by the introduction of MoS2 endow the hetero&#8208;MXenes with extraordinary structural stability and optimized Li+ storage mechanism with improved charge transport and lithium ion adsorption capabilities. As a result, hetero&#8208;Mo2C exhibits excellent electrochemical performance with a high discharge specific capacity of 1242 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1 and long cycle stability of 683.9 mAh g&#8722;1 after 1200 cycling. This work provides new insights into rational design of novel MXenes heterojunctions, practically important for the development of MXenes and their applications in high&#8208;performance energy storage systems.

         <title>Additive Manufacturing of Ti3C2 MXene&#8208;Functionalized Conductive Polymer Hydrogels for Electromagnetic&#8208;Interference Shielding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The ongoing miniaturization of devices and development of wireless and implantable technologies demand electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding materials with customizability. Additive manufacturing of conductive polymer hydrogels with favourable conductivity and biocompatibility can offer new opportunities for EMI shielding applications. However, simultaneously achieving high conductivity, design freedom, and shape fidelity in 3D printing of conductive polymer hydrogels is still very challenging. Here, an aqueous Ti3C2 MXene&#8208;functionalized PEDOT:PSS ink is developed for extrusion printing to create 3D objects with arbitrary geometries, and a freeze&#8208;thawing protocol is proposed to transform the printed objects directly into highly conductive and robust hydrogels with high shape fidelity in both macro and micro scales. The as&#8208;obtained hydrogel exhibits a high conductivity of 1525.8 S m&#8211;1 at water content up to 96.6 wt% and also satisfactory mechanical properties with flexibility, stretchability, and fatigue resistance. Furthermore, we demonstrate the use of the printed hydrogel for customizable EMI shielding applications. The proposed easy&#8208;to&#8208;manufacture approach, along with the highlighted superior properties, expands the potential of conductive polymer hydrogels in future customizable applications and represents a real breakthrough from the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Non&#8208;Fused Wide Bandgap Acceptor for Versatile Photovoltaic Applications</title>

Abstract
Wide bandgap non&#8208;fullerene acceptors with non&#8208;fused conjugated structures play a critical role in organic photovoltaic cells. Here, the non&#8208;fullerene acceptors named GS&#8208;OEH, GS&#8208;OC6 and GS&#8208;ISO with the optical bandgaps larger than 1.70&#160;eV are synthesized without using the fused ring structures. Compared with GS&#8208;OEH and GS&#8208;OC6, GS&#8208;ISO exhibits much stronger crystallinity, leading to a smaller energetic disorder and a larger exciton diffusion coefficient. GS&#8208;ISO also possesses a higher electroluminescence external quantum efficiency of 1.0&#215;10&#8211;2. The organic photovoltaic cell based on PBDB&#8208;TF:GS&#8208;ISO demonstrates a power conversion efficiency of 11.62% under the standard one sun illumination. Besides, the PBDB&#8208;TF:GS&#8208;ISO&#8208;based cell with the effective area of 1.0 cm2 exhibits a power conversion efficiency of 28.37% under the 2700 K illumination of 500 lux. The tandem organic photovoltaic cell using PBDB&#8208;TF:GS&#8208;ISO as the front sub&#8208;cell shows an outstanding efficiency of 19.10%. Importantly, the GS&#8208;ISO&#8208;based organic photovoltaic cell exhibits promising stability under the continuous illumination of the simulated sunlight. This study indicates that the molecular design strategy demonstrated in this work has great superiority in developing non&#8208;fused non&#8208;fullerene acceptors and also GS&#8208;ISO is a promising wide bandgap acceptor for versatile photovoltaic applications.

         <title>Light Intensity Analysis of Photovoltaic Parameters for Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light intensity analysis of photovoltaic parameters is introduced as a simple method, allowing understanding of the dominating mechanisms limiting the device performance in perovskite solar cells. The method is based on the drift&#8208;diffusion model and is aimed at helping in the explanation of parasitic losses from the trap&#8208;assisted recombination or ohmic losses in devices.








Abstract
The number of publications on perovskite solar cells (PSCs) continues to grow exponentially. Although the efficiency of PSCs has exceeded 25.5%, not every research laboratory can reproduce this result or even pass the border of 20%. Unfortunately, it is not always clear which dominating mechanism is responsible for the performance drop. Here, a simple method of light intensity analysis of the JV parameters is developed, allowing an understanding of what the mechanisms are that appear in the solar cell and limit device performance. The developed method is supported by the drift&#8208;diffusion model and is aimed at helping in the explanation of parasitic losses from the interface or bulk recombination, series resistance, or shunt resistance in the perovskite solar cell. This method can help not only point toward the dominating of bulk or interface recombination in the devices but also determine which interface is more defective. A detailed and stepwise guidance for such a type of light intensity analysis of JV parameters is provided. The proposed method and the conclusions of this study are supported by a series of case studies, showing the effectiveness of the proposed method on real examples.

         <title>Unraveling Anionic Redox for Sodium Layered Oxide Cathodes: Breakthroughs and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) as the next generation of sustainable energy technologies have received widespread investigations for large&#8208;scale energy storage systems (EESs) and smart grids due to the huge natural abundance and low cost of sodium. Although the great efforts have been made in exploring layered transition metal oxide cathode for SIBs, their performances have reached the bottleneck for further practical application. Nowadays, anionic redox in layered transition metal oxides have emerged as a new paradigm to increase the energy density of rechargeable batteries. Based on this point, in this review, we attempt to systematically summarize the development history of anionic redox reaction and provide an in&#8208;depth discussion on the anionic redox mechanism. Particularly, the major challenges of anionic redox and the corresponding available strategies toward triggering and stabilizing anionic redox are proposed.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) as the next generation of sustainable energy technologies have received widespread investigations for large-scale energy storage systems (EESs) and smart grids due to the huge natural abundance and low cost of sodium. Although the great efforts have been made in exploring layered transition metal oxide cathode for SIBs, their performances have reached the bottleneck for further practical application. Nowadays, anionic redox in layered transition metal oxides have emerged as a new paradigm to increase the energy density of rechargeable batteries. Based on this point, in this review, we attempt to systematically summarize the development history of anionic redox reaction and provide an in-depth discussion on the anionic redox mechanism. Particularly, the major challenges of anionic redox and the corresponding available strategies toward triggering and stabilizing anionic redox are proposed. Subsequently, several types of sodium layered oxide cathodes are classified and comparatively discussed according to Na-rich or Na-deficient materials. We also summarize a large amount of progressive characterization techniques of anionic oxygen redox. Finally, an overview of the existing prospective and the future development directions of sodium layered transition oxide with anionic redox reaction are analyzed and suggested.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Efficiency of Polymer Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes: A Perspective</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
This perspective article discusses the various contributions to the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs). The EQE of an organic light&#8208;emitting diode is governed by a number of parameters, such as the electrical efficiency, the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), the optical outcoupling efficiency and the spin statistics for singlet exciton generation. In the last decade the electrical efficiency has been determined from a numerical PLED device model. More recently, an optical model to simulate the fraction of photons outcoupled to air for PLEDs with a broad recombination zone has been developed. Together with the directly measured PLQY the EQE of a PLED can then be estimated. However, it has been observed that the measured EQEs of fluorescent PLEDs, including the model system super&#8208;yellow poly(p&#8208;phenylene vinylene) (SY&#8208;PPV) often exceed the expected values. To solve this discrepancy, we demonstrate that the electrical PLED model has to be expanded by the inclusion of triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation (TTA), which is shown to be responsible for a substantial EQE enhancement. Experimentally, it is obtained that TTA contributes to a singlet&#8208;exciton generation efficiency of &#8764;40% in SY&#8208;PPV PLEDs, giving rise to an EQE of &#8764;4% instead of the expected value of 2.5%.

         <title>Engineering Electronic Band Structure of Binary Thermoelectric Nanocatalysts for Augmented Pyrocatalytic Tumor Nanotherapy</title>

Abstract
Photothermal therapy (PTT) has emerged as a distinct therapeutic modality owing to its non&#8208;invasiveness and spatiotemporal selectivity. However, the heat&#8208;shock proteins (HSPs) endow tumor cells with resistance to heat&#8208;induced apoptosis, severely lowering the therapeutic efficacy of PTT. In this study, we&#160;developed a high&#8208;performance pyroelectric nanocatalyst, Bi13S18I2 nanorods (Nrs), with prominent pyroelectric conversion and photothermal conversion performance for augmented pyrocatalytic tumor nanotherapy. Canonical binary compounds were&#160;reconstructed by inserting a third biocompatible agent, thus facilitating the formation of Bi13S18I2 Nrs with enhanced pyrocatalytic conversion efficiency. Under 808&#160;nm laser irradiation, Bi13S18I2 Nrs induced a conspicuous temperature elevation for photonic hyperthermia. In particular, Bi13S18I2 Nrs harvested pyrocatalytic energy from the heating and cooling alterations to produce abundant reactive oxygen species (ROS), which resulted in the depletion of HSPs and hence the reduction of thermo&#8208;resistance of tumor cells, thereby significantly augmenting the therapeutic efficacy of photothermal tumor hyperthermia. By synergizing the pyroelectric dynamic therapy with PTT, tumor suppression with a significant tumor inhibition rate of 97.2% was&#160;achieved after intravenous administration of Bi13S18I2 Nrs and subsequent exposure to an 808&#160;nm laser. This work opens an avenue for the design of high&#8208;performance pyroelectric nanocatalysts by reconstructing canonical binary compounds for therapeutic applications in biocatalytic nanomedicine.

         <title>Tailoring Aggregation Extent of Photosensitizer to Boost Phototherapy Potency for Eliciting Systemic Antitumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Phototherapy is an effective therapy for triggering the immunogenic cell death (ICD) effect. However, its efficacy is limited by low 1O2 generation and photothermal conversion efficacy due to two irreconcilable obstacles, namely aggregation&#8208;caused&#8208;quenching (ACQ) effect and photo&#8208;bleaching. Herein, a discretely integrated nanofabrication platform (Pt&#8208;ICG/PES) is developed by facile coordination co&#8208;assembly of cisplatin (Pt), photosensitizer molecules (indocyanine green [ICG]), and polymeric spacer (p(MEO2MA&#8208;co&#8208;OEGMA)&#8208;b&#8208;pSS, PES). By controlling the ICG/PES feeding ratio, the aggregation of ICG can be easily tailored using PES as an isolator to balance the ACQ effect and photo&#8208;bleaching, thereby maximizing the phototherapy potency of Pt&#8208;ICG/PES. With the optimized ratio of each component, Pt&#8208;ICG/PES integrates the complementarity of photodynamic therapy, photothermal therapy, and chemotherapeutics to magnify the ICD effect, exerting a synergistic anti&#8208;tumor immunity&#8208;promoting effect. Additionally, temperature&#8208;sensitive PES enables photothermal guided drug delivery. In the tumor&#8208;bearing mouse model, Pt&#8208;ICG/PES elicits effective release of danger&#8208;associated molecular patterns, dendritic cell maturation, cytotoxic T lymphocytes activation, cytokine secretion, M2 macrophage repolarization, and distal tumor suppression, confirming the excellent in situ tumor ICD effect as well as robust systematic antitumor immunity. Ultimately, we develop a versatile discretely integrated nanofabrication strategy to optimize the phototherapeutic efficacy for improving antitumor effects and strengthening systemic antitumor immunity.

         <title>Reversible Manipulation of Photoconductivity Caused by Surface Oxygen Vacancies in Perovskite Stannates with Ultraviolet Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Programmable optoelectronic devices calls for the reversible control of photo&#8208;carrier recombination process by in&#8208;gap states in emergent oxide semiconductors. However, previous approaches to produce oxygen vacancies as a source of in&#8208;gap states in oxide semiconductors have hampered the reversible formation of oxygen vacancies and their related phenomena. Here, a new strategy to manipulate the two&#8208;dimensional photoconductivity from perovskite stannates is demonstrated by exploiting spatially&#8208;selective photochemical reaction under ultraviolet illumination at room temperature. Remarkably, the ideal trap&#8208;free photocurrent of air&#8208;illuminated BaSnO3 (&#8764; 200 pA) is reversibly switched into three orders of magnitude higher photocurrent of vacuum&#8208;illuminated BaSnO3 (&#8764; 335 nA) with persistent photoconductivity depending on ambient oxygen pressure under illumination. Multiple theoretical and experimental characterizations elucidate that ultraviolet illumination of BaSnO3 under low oxygen pressure induces surface oxygen vacancies as a result of surface photolysis combined with the low oxygen&#8208;diffusion coefficient of BaSnO3; the concentrated oxygen vacancies are likely to induce a two&#8208;step transition of photocurrent response by changing the characteristics of in&#8208;gap states from shallow level to deep level. These original results suggest a novel strategy that uses light&#8208;matter interaction in a reversible and spatially&#8208;confined way to manipulate functionalities related to surface defect states, for the emerging applications using newly discovered oxide semiconductors.

         <title>Electrostatic&#8208;mechanical Synergistic in situ Multiscale Tissue Adhesion for Sustainable Residue&#8208;free Bioelectronics Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Recent studies on soft adhesives have sought to deeply understand how their chemical or mechanical structures interact strongly with living tissues. The aim is to optimally address the unmet needs of patients with acute or chronic diseases. Synergistic adhesion involving both electrostatic (hydrogen bonds) and mechanical interactions (capillarity&#8208;assisted suction stress) seems to be effective in overcoming the challenges associated with long&#8208;term unstable coupling to tissues. Here, we report the electrostatically and mechanically synergistic mechanism of residue&#8208;free sustainable in situ tissue adhesion by implementing hybrid multiscale architectonics. To deduce the mechanism, a thermodynamic model based on a tailored multiscale combinatory adhesive was proposed. The model supported the experimental results that the thermodynamically controlled swelling of the nanoporous hydrogel embedded in the hierarchical elastomeric structure enhances biofluid&#8208;insensitive sustainable in situ adhesion to diverse soft, slippery, and wet organ surfaces, as well as clean detachment in the peeling direction. Based on the robust tissue adhesion capability, we successfully demonstrated universal reliable measurements of electrophysiological signals generated by various tissues ranging from rodent sciatic nerve, the muscle, brain, and human skin.

Synergistic adhesion involving both electrostatic (hydrogen bonds) and mechanical interactions (capillarity-assisted suction stress) seems to be effective in overcoming the challenges associated with long-term unstable coupling to tissues. Here, we report the electrostatically and mechanically synergistic mechanism of residue-free sustainable in situ tissue adhesion by implementing hybrid multiscale architectonics. To deduce the mechanism, a thermodynamic model based on a tailored multiscale combinatory adhesive was proposed. The model supported the experimental results that the thermodynamically controlled swelling of the nanoporous hydrogel embedded in the hierarchical elastomeric structure enhances biofluid-insensitive sustainable in situ adhesion to diverse soft, slippery, and wet organ surfaces, as well as clean detachment in the peeling direction. Based on the robust tissue adhesion capability, we successfully demonstrated universal reliable measurements of electrophysiological signals generated by various tissues ranging from rodent sciatic nerve, the muscle, brain, and human skin.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Cellular Nanosponges for Biological Neutralization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Biological neutralization represents a general strategy that deploys therapeutic agents to bind with harmful molecules or infectious pathogens, block their bioactivity, and thus prevent them from causing the diseases. This article provides a comprehensive review of using cell membrane&#8208;coated nanoparticles, namely &#8216;cellular nanosponges&#8217;, as host decoys for a wide range of biological neutralization applications. Compared to traditional neutralization strategies, the cellular nanosponges stand out by mimicking susceptible host cells rather than accommodating the structures of the causative agents for the design of therapeutics. As all pathological agents must interact with host cells for bioactivity, nanosponges bypass the diversity of these agents and create function&#8208;driven and broad&#8208;spectrum neutralization solutions. The review focuses on the recent progress of using this new nanomedicine platform for neutralization against five primary pathological agents, including bacterial toxins, chemical toxicants, inflammatory cytokines, pathological antibodies, and viruses. Existing studies have established cellular nanosponges as versatile tools for biological neutralization. A thorough review of the cellular nanosponge technology is expected to inspire more refined cellular nanosponge designs and unique neutralization applications to address unsolved medical problems.

Flexible Lithium&#8208;Based Batteries
The seamless implementation of the power supply to flexi ble and wearable electronics urgently requires the development of flexible lithium&#8208;based batteries (FLBs), which not only enhance the energy capacity by fully utilizing the available space but also revolutionize the form factors of future device design. Through a systematic theoretical calculation of the energy density of various FLBs and a figure of merit to characterize the performance of FLBs, in article number 2004419, Zijian Zheng and co&#8208;workers find that the fabric&#8208;type FLB exhibits the most feasible pathway for simultaneously achieving high flexibility and high energy density toward various flexible and wearable products.

         <title>Plasmonic Photoelectrochemistry: In View of Hot Carriers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 46, November 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoelectrochemistry provides a powerful toolbox for mechanistic studies on hot&#8208;carrier&#8208;driven reactions in plasmonic photocatalysis. The working principles and applications of plasmonic photoelectrochemistry are summarized.








Abstract
Utilizing plasmon&#8208;generated hot carriers to drive chemical reactions has emerged as a popular topic in solar photocatalysis. However, a complete description of the underlying mechanism of hot&#8208;carrier transfer in photochemical processes remains elusive, particularly for those involving hot holes. Photoelectrochemistry enables to localize hot holes on photoanodes and hot electrons on photocathodes and thus offers an approach to separately explore the hole&#8208;transfer dynamics and electron&#8208;transfer dynamics. This review summarizes a comprehensive understanding of both hot&#8208;hole and hot&#8208;electron transfers from photoelectrochemical studies on plasmonic electrodes. Additionally, working principles and applications of spectroelectrochemistry are discussed for plasmonic materials. It is concluded that photoelectrochemistry provides a powerful toolbox to gain mechanistic insights into plasmonic photocatalysis.

         <title>Tuning Microbial Activity via Programmatic Alteration of Cell/Substrate Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 46, November 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Concepts of inorganic substrate/microorganism biointerfaces that can serve as &#8220;smart&#8221; materials with desired reactions to external conditions are discussed. Understanding how such sophisticated structures may be formulated and various types of their responses is essential for the discovery of novel approaches in the areas of biosensing, bioelectronics, and biocompatible materials.








Abstract
A wide portfolio of advanced programmable materials and structures has been developed for biological applications in the last two decades. Particularly, due to their unique properties, semiconducting materials have been utilized in areas of biocomputing, implantable electronics, and healthcare. As a new concept of such programmable material design, biointerfaces based on inorganic semiconducting materials as substrates introduce unconventional paths for bioinformatics and biosensing. In particular, understanding how the properties of a substrate can alter microbial biofilm behavior enables researchers to better characterize and thus create programmable biointerfaces with necessary characteristics on demand. Herein, the current status of advanced microorganism&#8211;inorganic biointerfaces is summarized along with types of responses that can be observed in such hybrid systems. This work identifies promising inorganic material types along with target microorganisms that will be critical for future research on programmable biointerfacial structures.

         <title>Synthesis, Assembly, Optical Properties, and Sensing Applications of Plasmonic Gap Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 46, November 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Plasmonic nanogaps are key structural components in inducing and controlling strong electromagnetic field for the enhancement of optical signals, and could be useful for various applications including surface&#8208;enhanced spectroscopy, biosensing, and bioimaging. Recent advances in forming plasmonic gap nanostructures, theoretical understanding of their optical properties, and the use of these structures for various sensing applications are summarized and discussed.








Abstract
Plasmonic gap nanostructures (PGNs) have been extensively investigated mainly because of their strongly enhanced optical responses, which stem from the high intensity of the localized field in the nanogap. The recently developed methods for the preparation of versatile nanogap structures open new avenues for the exploration of unprecedented optical properties and development of sensing applications relying on the amplification of various optical signals. However, the reproducible and controlled preparation of highly uniform plasmonic nanogaps and the prediction, understanding, and control of their optical properties, especially for nanogaps in the nanometer or sub&#8208;nanometer range, remain challenging. This is because subtle changes in the nanogap significantly affect the plasmonic response and are of paramount importance to the desired optical performance and further applications. Here, recent advances in the synthesis, assembly, and fabrication strategies, prediction and control of optical properties, and sensing applications of PGNs are discussed, and perspectives toward addressing these challenging issues and the future research directions are presented.

         <title>Innovations in Disease State Responsive Soft Materials for Targeting Extracellular Stimuli Associated with Cancer, Cardiovascular Disease, Diabetes, and Beyond</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 46, November 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Over the past decade, the field of programmable soft materials for biomedical applications has rapidly expanded. Recent advances that show promising results in preclinical animal models are described for the treatment of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Efforts have focused on materials capable of sensing disease&#8208;associated endogenous stimuli and responding via a range of dynamic processes.








Abstract
Recent advances in polymer chemistry, materials sciences, and biotechnology have allowed the preclinical development of sophisticated programmable nanomedicines and materials that are able to precisely respond to specific disease&#8208;associated triggers and microenvironments. These stimuli, endogenous to the targeted diseases, include pH, redox&#8208;state, small molecules, and protein upregulation. Herein, recent advances and innovative approaches in programmable soft materials capable of sensing the aforementioned disease&#8208;associated stimuli and responding via a range of dynamic processes including morphological and size transitions, changes in mobility and retention, as well as disassembly are described. In this field generally, the majority of ongoing and past research effort has focused on oncology. Given this interest, examples of the latest innovative approaches to chemo&#8208; and immunotherapy treatment strategies for cancer are presented. Moreover, as the field broadens its attention, applications of programmable materials in other diseases are highlighted, with a special focus on cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus, where limited attention is paid by the field, but where many promising avenues exist with high potential impact.

         <title>Controlled Assembly of Plasmonic Nanoparticles: From Static to Dynamic Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 46, November 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spatial organization of plasmonic nano particles can dramatically affect their properties. Therefore, control over the assembly structure offers an effective approach toward tunable and enhanced plasmonic properties. Recent advances in the controlled assembly of plasmonic nanoparticles and their impact on the development of dynamic systems that are capable of programmable structural transformation to activate target properties are reviewed.








Abstract
The spatial arrangement of plasmonic nanoparticles can dramatically affect their interaction with electromagnetic waves, which offers an effective approach to systematically control their optical properties and manifest new phenomena. To this end, significant efforts were made to develop methodologies by which the assembly structure of metal nanoparticles can be controlled with high precision. Herein, recent advances in bottom&#8208;up chemical strategies toward the well&#8208;controlled assembly of plasmonic nanoparticles, including multicomponent and multifunctional systems are reviewed. Further, it is discussed how the progress in this area has paved the way toward the construction of smart dynamic nanostructures capable of on&#8208;demand, reversible structural changes that alter their properties in a predictable and reproducible manner. Finally, this review provides insight into the challenges, future directions, and perspectives in the field of controlled plasmonic assemblies.

         <title>Programmable Mechanically Active Hydrogel&#8208;Based Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 46, November 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogel&#8208;based mechanically active materials (MAMs) are a diverse class of materials that are able to sense and respond to external stimuli by producing a physical deformation. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art programming of MAMs in recent studies is highlighted. Materials, fabrication methods, responsive mechanisms, and novel applications of hydrogel MAMs are systematically discussed.








Abstract
Programmable mechanically active materials (MAMs) are defined as materials that can sense and transduce external stimuli into mechanical outputs or conversely that can detect mechanical stimuli and respond through an optical change or other change in the appearance of the material. Programmable MAMs are a subset of responsive materials and offer potential in next generation robotics and smart systems. This review specifically focuses on hydrogel&#8208;based MAMs because of their mechanical compliance, programmability, biocompatibility, and cost&#8208;efficiency. First, the composition of hydrogel MAMs along with the top&#8208;down and bottom&#8208;up approaches used for programming these materials are discussed. Next, the fundamental principles for engineering responsivity in MAMS, which includes optical, thermal, magnetic, electrical, chemical, and mechanical stimuli, are considered. Some advantages and disadvantages of different responsivities are compared. Then, to conclude, the emerging applications of hydrogel&#8208;based MAMs from recently published literature, as well as the future outlook of MAM studies, are summarized.

         <title>Programmable Metal Nanoclusters with Atomic Precision</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 46, November 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically precise metal nanoclusters (NCs) in the quantum size regime are an emerging class of new materials. The progress in the synthesis and structure&#8211;function correlation is summarized using gold NCs as a paradigm system. The rich types of structures impact the electronic and optical properties. For future work, the field will move toward &#8220;programmable&#8221; control with advanced synthesis methods.








Abstract
With the recent establishment of atomically precise nanochemistry, capabilities toward programmable control over the nanoparticle size and structure are being developed. Advances in the synthesis of atomically precise nanoclusters (NCs, 1&#8211;3&#160;nm) have been made in recent years, and more importantly, their total structures (core plus ligands) have been mapped out by X&#8208;ray crystallography. These ultrasmall Au nanoparticles exhibit strong quantum&#8208;confinement effect, manifested in their optical absorption properties. With the advantage of atomic precision, gold&#8208;thiolate nanoclusters (Aun(SR)m) are revealed to contain an inner kernel, Au&#8211;S interface (motifs), and surface ligand (&#8208;R) shell. Programming the atomic packing into various crystallographic structures of the metal kernel can be achieved, which plays a significant role in determining the optical properties and the energy gap (Eg) of NCs. When the size increases, a general trend is observed for NCs with fcc or decahedral kernels, whereas those NCs with icosahedral kernels deviate from the general trend by showing comparably smaller Eg. Comparisons are also made to further demonstrate the more decisive role of the kernel structure over surface motifs based on isomeric Au NCs and NC series with evolving kernel or motif structures. Finally, future perspectives are discussed.

         <title>Nanodots Derived from Layered Materials: Synthesis and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 46, November 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanodots derived from layered materials not only exhibit the intriguing properties of traditional nanodots due to the size confinement effect, but also inherit some unique properties of layered materials, making them promising candidates in various applications. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art progress on the preparation and applications of nanodots derived from layered materials is reviewed.








Abstract
Layered 2D materials, such as graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides, transition metal oxides, black phosphorus, graphitic carbon nitride, hexagonal boron nitride, and MXenes, have attracted intensive attention over the past decades owing to their unique properties and wide applications in electronics, catalysis, energy storage, biomedicine, etc. Further reducing the lateral size of layered 2D materials down to less than 10&#160;nm allows for preparing a new class of nanostructures, namely, nanodots derived from layered materials. Nanodots derived from layered materials not only can exhibit the intriguing properties of nanodots due to the size confinement originating from the ultrasmall size, but also can inherit some unique properties of ultrathin layered 2D materials, making them promising candidates in a wide range of applications, especially in biomedicine and catalysis. Here, a comprehensive summary on the materials categories, advantages, synthesis methods, and potential applications of these nanodots derived from layered materials is provided. Finally, personal insights about the challenges and future directions in this promising research field are also given.

         <title>Programmable Logic in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 46, November 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent key progress achieved in designing metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based catalysts, the active sites, and associated regulation strategies is summarized. Besides, the effects of metal ions, organic ligands, modifiers, functional materials, and post&#8208;treatment modules on the compositions, structures, and morphologies are also highlighted. Modular design may inspire researchers who attempt to develop MOF&#8208;based catalysts with desired functional properties. 








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as one of the most widely investigated materials in catalysis mainly due to their excellent component tunability, high surface area, adjustable pore size, and uniform active sites. However, the overwhelming number of MOF materials and complex structures has brought difficulties for researchers to select and construct suitable MOF&#8208;based catalysts. Herein, a programmable design strategy is presented based on metal ions/clusters, organic ligands, modifiers, functional materials, and post&#8208;treatment modules, which can be used to design the components, structures, and morphologies of MOF catalysts for different reactions. By establishing the corresponding relationship between these modules and functions, researchers can accurately and efficiently construct heterometallic MOFs, chiral MOFs, conductive MOFs, hierarchically porous MOFs, defective MOFs, MOF composites, and MOF&#8208;derivative catalysts. Further, this programmable design approach can also be used to regulate the physical/chemical microenvironments of pristine MOFs, MOF composites, and MOF&#8208;derivative materials for heterogeneous catalysis, electrocatalysis, and photocatalysis. Finally, the challenging issues and opportunities for the future research of MOF&#8208;based catalysts are discussed. Overall, the modular design concept of this review can be applied as a potent tool for exploring the structure&#8211;activity relationships and accelerating the on&#8208;demand design of multicomponent catalysts.

         <title>Programmable Assembly of &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 46, November 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#960;&#8208;Conjugated polymer properties depend intrinsically on polymer order, including crystallinity, orientation, morphology, domain size, and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. Order can be programmed through covalent bonding, i.e., molecular design, or through processing techniques in solution or solid&#8208;state. This perspective serves as a guide to directing &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer assembly, control polymer order, and thereby control its optical, electronic, and mechanical properties.








Abstract
&#960;&#8208;Conjugated polymers have numerous applications due to their advantageous optoelectronic and mechanical properties. These properties depend intrinsically on polymer ordering, including crystallinity, orientation, morphology, domain size, and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. Programming, or deliberately controlling the composition and ordering of &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers by well&#8208;defined inputs, is a key facet in the development of organic electronics. Here, &#960;&#8208;conjugated programming is described at each stage of material development, stressing the links between each programming mode. Covalent programming is performed during polymer synthesis such that complex architectures can be constructed, which direct polymer assembly by governing polymer orientation, &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, and morphological length&#8208;scales. Solution programming is performed in a solvated state as polymers dissolve, aggregate, crystallize, or react in solution. Solid&#8208;state programming occurs in the solid state and is governed by polymer crystallization, domain segregation, or gelation. Recent progress in programming across these stages is examined, highlighting order&#8208;dependent features and assembly techniques that are unique to &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers.

     alt="Programmable Assembly of &#960;-Conjugated Polymers"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#960;-Conjugated polymer properties depend intrinsically on polymer order, including crystallinity, orientation, morphology, domain size, and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. Order can be programmed through covalent bonding, i.e., molecular design, or through processing techniques in solution or solid-state. This perspective serves as a guide to directing &#960;-conjugated polymer assembly, control polymer order, and thereby control its optical, electronic, and mechanical properties.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#960;-Conjugated polymers have numerous applications due to their advantageous optoelectronic and mechanical properties. These properties depend intrinsically on polymer ordering, including crystallinity, orientation, morphology, domain size, and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. Programming, or deliberately controlling the composition and ordering of &#960;-conjugated polymers by well-defined inputs, is a key facet in the development of organic electronics. Here, &#960;-conjugated programming is described at each stage of material development, stressing the links between each programming mode. Covalent programming is performed during polymer synthesis such that complex architectures can be constructed, which direct polymer assembly by governing polymer orientation, &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, and morphological length-scales. Solution programming is performed in a solvated state as polymers dissolve, aggregate, crystallize, or react in solution. Solid-state programming occurs in the solid state and is governed by polymer crystallization, domain segregation, or gelation. Recent progress in programming across these stages is examined, highlighting order-dependent features and assembly techniques that are unique to &#960;-conjugated polymers. This should serve as a guide for delineating the many ways of directing &#960;-conjugated polymer assembly to control ordering, structure, and function, enabling the further development of organic electronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Plasmonic Coupling Architectures for Enhanced Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 46, November 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Excitation of plasmonic coupling architectures induces an extremely strong local electromagnetic field that can significantly impact nearby semiconductors through plasmon&#8208;driven charge/energy transfer to enhance the photocatalytic activity. Recent advances in the development of plasmonic coupling architectures and different strategies of integration with semiconductor photocatalysts are reviewed. Remaining challenges and future prospects of plasmonic coupling for sustainable solar&#8208;driven reactions are also discussed.








Abstract
Plasmonic photocatalysis is a promising approach for solar energy transformation. Comparing with isolated metal nanoparticles, the plasmonic coupling architectures can provide further strengthened local electromagnetic field and boosted light&#8208;harvesting capability through optimal control over the composition, spacing, and orientation of individual nanocomponents. As such, when integrated with semiconductor photocatalysts, the coupled metal nanostructures can dramatically promote exciton generation and separation through plasmonic&#8208;coupling&#8208;driven charge/energy transfer toward superior photocatalytic efficiencies. Herein, the principles of the plasmonic coupling effect are presented and recent progress on the construction of plasmonic coupling architectures and their integration with semiconductors for enhanced photocatalytic reactions is summarized. In addition, the remaining challenges as to the rational design and utilization of plasmon coupling structures are elaborated, and some prospects to inspire new opportunities on the future development of plasmonic coupling structures for efficient and sustainable light&#8208;driven reactions are raised.

         <title>Mechanomaterials: A Rational Deployment of Forces and Geometries in Programming Functional Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 46, November 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emerging paradigm shift, from passive access to the mechanics of materials toward proactive functionality programming, is coined as mechanomaterials. Its rise comes with the rational deployment of force&#8211;geometry&#8211;property relationships at multiples scales, which has delivered diverse functional materials with unprecedented mechanical, optical, electrical, and biological performance, including the explosion of novel actuators, flexible electronics, mechanochromics, and mechaomedicine.








Abstract
The knowledge of mechanics of materials has been extensively implemented in developing functional materials, giving rise to recent advances in soft actuators, flexible electronics, mechanical metamaterials, tunable mechanochromics, regenerative mechanomedicine, etc. While conventional mechanics of materials offers passive access to mechanical properties of materials in existing forms, a paradigm shift is emerging toward proactive programming of materials&#8217; functionality by leveraging the force&#8211;geometry&#8211;property relationships. Here, such a rising field is coined as &#8220;mechanomaterials&#8221;. To profile the concept, the design principles in this field at four scales is first outlined, namely the atomic scale, the molecular scale, the manipulation of nanoscale materials, and the microscale design of structural materials. A variety of techniques have been recruited to deliver the multiscale programming of functional mechanomaterials, such as strain engineering, capillary assembly, topological interlocking, kirigami, origami, to name a few. Engineering optical and biological functionalities have also been achieved by implementing the fundamentals of mechanochemistry and mechanobiology. Nonetheless, the field of mechanomaterials is still in its infancy, with many open challenges and opportunities that need to be addressed. The authors hope this review can serve as a modest spur to attract more researchers to further advance this field.

The working principles and characteristics of biological neurons and synapses, as well as recent developments of memristive materials and devices that emulate synaptic functions based on electric, magnetic, and optical stimulations are highlighted.








Abstract
Neuromorphic computing holds promise for building next&#8208;generation intelligent systems in a more energy&#8208;efficient way than the conventional von Neumann computing architecture. Memristive hardware, which mimics biological neurons and synapses, offers high&#8208;speed operation and low power consumption, enabling energy&#8208; and area&#8208;efficient, brain&#8208;inspired computing. Here, recent advances in memristive materials and strategies that emulate synaptic functions for neuromorphic computing are highlighted. The working principles and characteristics of biological neurons and synapses, which can be mimicked by memristive devices, are presented. Besides device structures and operation with different external stimuli such as electric, magnetic, and optical fields, how memristive materials with a rich variety of underlying physical mechanisms can allow fast, reliable, and low&#8208;power neuromorphic applications is also discussed. Finally, device requirements are examined and a perspective on challenges in developing memristive materials for device engineering and computing science is given.

         <title>Designing Copper&#8208;Based Catalysts for Efficient Carbon Dioxide Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 46, November 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in Cu&#8208;based catalysts for CO2 and CO electroreduction to multi&#8208;carbon products are reviewed. Progress in mechanistic investigations is summarized, including the formation and adsorption of CO, C&#8211;C coupling, and post&#8208;C&#8211;C&#8208;coupling steps. Catalyst design strategies derived from the mechanistic insights are then discussed. Finally, challenges and perspectives of the future CO2 reduction development are provided.








Abstract
The electroreduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) has been emerging as a high&#8208; potential approach for CO2 utilization using renewables. When copper (Cu) based catalysts are used, this platform can produce multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) fuels and chemicals with almost net&#8208;zero emission, contributing to the closure of the anthropogenic carbon cycle. Nonetheless, the rational design and development of Cu&#8208;based catalysts are critical toward the realization of highly selective and efficient CO2 electroreduction. In this review, first the latest advances in Cu&#8208;catalyzed CO2 electroreduction in the product selectivity and electrocatalytic activity are briefly summarized. Then, recent theoretical and mechanistic studies of CO2 electroreduction on Cu&#8208;based catalysts are investigated, which serve as programs to design catalysts. Strategies for devising Cu catalysts that aim at promoting different key elementary steps for hydrocarbon and C2+ oxygenates production are further summarized. Moreover, challenges in understanding the mechanism, operando investigation of Cu catalysts and reactions, and systems&#8217; influences are also presented. Finally, the future prospects of CO2 electroreduction are discussed.

&lt;p&gt;Recent advances in Cu-based catalysts for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CO electroreduction to multi-carbon products are reviewed. Progress in mechanistic investigations is summarized, including the formation and adsorption of CO, C&#8211;C coupling, and post-C&#8211;C-coupling steps. Catalyst design strategies derived from the mechanistic insights are then discussed. Finally, challenges and perspectives of the future CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction development are provided.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electroreduction of carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) has been emerging as a high- potential approach for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; utilization using renewables. When copper (Cu) based catalysts are used, this platform can produce multi-carbon (C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt;) fuels and chemicals with almost net-zero emission, contributing to the closure of the anthropogenic carbon cycle. Nonetheless, the rational design and development of Cu-based catalysts are critical toward the realization of highly selective and efficient CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction. In this review, first the latest advances in Cu-catalyzed CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction in the product selectivity and electrocatalytic activity are briefly summarized. Then, recent theoretical and mechanistic studies of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction on Cu-based catalysts are investigated, which serve as programs to design catalysts. Strategies for devising Cu catalysts that aim at promoting different key elementary steps for hydrocarbon and C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; oxygenates production are further summarized. Moreover, challenges in understanding the mechanism, operando investigation of Cu catalysts and reactions, and systems&#8217; influences are also presented. Finally, the future prospects of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 46, November 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
For more than 30&#160;000&#160;years, carbon ink has mainly been used as a black color pigment. However, the recent discovery of nanocarbon materials with remarkable physical and chemical properties enables new applications well beyond coloring. Recent advances in the development of nanocarbon inks and their emergent applications are reviewed, highlighting the fundamental and technical challenges as well as opportunities.








Abstract
For thousands of years, carbon ink has been used as a black color pigment for writing and painting purposes. However, recent discoveries of nanocarbon materials, including fullerenes, carbon nanotubes, graphene, and their various derivative forms, together with the advances in large&#8208;scale synthesis, are enabling a whole new generation of carbon inks that can serve as an intrinsically programmable materials platform for developing advanced functionalities far beyond color. The marriage between these multifunctional nanocarbon inks with modern printing technologies is facilitating and even transforming many applications, including flexible electronics, wearable and implantable sensors, actuators, and autonomous robotics. This review examines recent progress in the reborn field of carbon inks, highlighting their programmability and multifunctionality for applications in flexible electronics and stimuli&#8208;responsive devices. Current challenges and opportunities will also be discussed from a materials science perspective towards the advancement of carbon ink for new applications beyond color.

         <title>Developing the Nondevelopable: Creating Curved&#8208;Surface Electronics from Nonstretchable Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Curved&#8208;surface electronics promise to bring new levels of interactivity, sensitivity, and energy efficiency to our&#160;everyday lives. These curved shapes, however, pose a challenge to established fabrication methods for high&#8208;performance electronics. In this work, ultrathin, nonstretchable planar electronics are attached to nondevelopable surfaces by introducing a shrinkage&#8208;based wrinkling paradigm that can enable future curved devices to leverage developments in flexible electronics.








Abstract
The incorporation of electronics onto curved surfaces promises to bring new levels of intelligence to the ergonomic, aesthetic, aerodynamic, and optical surfaces that are ever&#8208;present in our&#160;lives. However, since many of these surfaces have 2D (i.e., nondevelopable) curvature, they cannot be formed from the deformation of a flat, nonstretchable sheet. This means that curved electronics cannot capitalize on the rapid technological advances taking place in the field of ultrathin electronics, since ultrathin devices, though ultraflexible, are not stretchable. In this work, a shrink&#8208;based paradigm is presented to apply such thin&#8208;film electronics to nondevelopable surfaces, expanding the capabilities of current nondevelopable electronics, and linking future developments in thin&#8208;film technology to similar developments in curved devices. The wrinkling of parylene&#8208;based devices and the effects of shrinkage on common electrical components are examined, culminating in shrinkable touch sensors and organic photovoltaics, laminated to various nondevelopable surfaces without loss of performance.

         <title>Versatile Preparation of Mesoporous Single&#8208;Layered Transition&#8208;Metal Sulfide/Carbon Composites for Enhanced Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mesoporous single&#8208;layered MoS2/carbon composite is successfully synthesized, which displays remarkable electrochemical performance for both sodium&#8208;ion batteries and sodium&#8208;ion full cells. The reaction mechanism is systematically investigated by in situ and ex situ characterizations. This work may be expected to guide the future design protocol for various mesoporous single&#8208;layered transition&#8208;metal sulfide/carbon composite materials.








Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal sulfides are promising electrochemical energy storage materials due to their abundant active sites, large interlayer space, and high theoretical capacities, especially for sodium storage. However, the low conductivity and poor cycling stability at high current densities hamper their applications. Herein, a versatile dual&#8208;template method is reported to elaborate ordered mesoporous single&#8208;layered MoS2/carbon composite with high specific area, uniform pore size, and large pore volume. The single&#8208;layered MoS2 is confined in the carbon matrix. The mesopores between the composite nanorods provide fast electrolyte diffusion. The obtained nanocomposite shows a high sodium&#8208;storage capability, excellent rate capacity, and very good cycling performance. A capacity of 310 mAh g&#8722;1 can remain at 5.0 A g&#8722;1 after 2500 cycles. Furthermore, a sodium&#8208;ion battery (SIB) full cell composed of the MoS2/carbon composite anode and a Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cathode maintains a specific capacity of 330&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 1.0 A g&#8722;1 during 100 cycles. The mechanism is investigated by in situ and ex situ characterizations as well as density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

         <title>Homojunction Perovskite Quantum Dot Solar Cells with over 1&#160;&#181;m&#8208;Thick Photoactive Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a charge&#8208;transfer doping strategy to tune the carrier&#8208;type, P/N homojunction CsPbI3 perovskite QD solar cells are demonstrated; the P/N homojunction significantly improves the carrier dynamic process and outputs record high efficiency in a QD active layer with thickness over 1&#160;&#181;m, demonstrating great potential for the future printing manufacturing of QD PVs.








Abstract
The solution&#8208;processed solar cells based on colloidal quantum dots (QDs) reported so far generally suffer from poor thickness tolerance and it is difficult for them to be compatible with large&#8208;scale solution printing technology. However, the recently emerged perovskite QDs, with unique high defect tolerance, are particularly well&#8208;suited for efficient photovoltaics.

&lt;p&gt;Through a charge-transfer doping strategy to tune the carrier-type, P/N homojunction CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite QD solar cells are demonstrated; the P/N homojunction significantly improves the carrier dynamic process and outputs record high efficiency in a QD active layer with thickness over 1&#160;&#181;m, demonstrating great potential for the future printing manufacturing of QD PVs.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution-processed solar cells based on colloidal quantum dots (QDs) reported so far generally suffer from poor thickness tolerance and it is difficult for them to be compatible with large-scale solution printing technology. However, the recently emerged perovskite QDs, with unique high defect tolerance, are particularly well-suited for efficient photovoltaics. Herein, efficient CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite QD solar cells are demonstrated first with over 1&#160;&#181;m-thick active layer by developing an internal P/N homojunction. Specifically, an organic dopant 2,2&#8242;-(perfluoronaphthalene-2,6-diylidene) dimalononitrile (F6TCNNQ) is introduced into CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; QD arrays to prepare different carrier-type QD arrays. The detailed characterizations reveal successful charge-transfer doping of QDs and carrier-type transformation from n-type to p-type. Subsequently, the P/N homojunction perovskite QD solar cell is assembled using different carrier-type QDs, delivering an enhanced power conversion efficiency of 15.29%. Most importantly, this P/N homojunction strategy realizes remarkable thickness tolerance of QD solar cells, showing a record high efficiency of 12.28% for a 1.2&#160;&#181;m-thick QD active-layer and demonstrating great potential for the future printing manufacturing of QDs solar cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polarimetric Image Sensor and Fermi Level Shifting Induced Multichannel Transition Based on 2D PdPS</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wide spectral response photodetector and polarimetric image sensor based on 2D palladium phosphide sulfide (PdPS) are designed. The photoresponse range of PdPS is from solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet to the near&#8208;infrared. The PdPS&#8208;based polarimetric imaging sensor achieves object imaging and hidden&#8208;target detection in complex environments.








Abstract
2D materials have been attracting high interest in recent years due to their low structural symmetry, excellent photoresponse, and high air stability. However, most 2D materials can only respond to specific light, which limits the development of wide&#8208;spectrum photodetectors. Proper bandgap and the regulation of Fermi level are the foundations for realizing electronic multichannel transition, which is an effective method to achieve a wide spectral response. Herein, a noble 2D material, palladium phosphide sulfide (PdPS), is designed and synthesized. The bandgap of PdPS is around 2.1&#160;eV and the formation of S vacancies, interstitial Pd and P atoms promote the Fermi level very close to the conduction band. Therefore, the PdPS&#8208;based photodetector shows impressive wide spectral response from solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet to near&#8208;infrared based on the multichannel transition. It also exhibits superior optoelectrical properties with photoresponsivity (R) of 1 &#215; 103 A W&#8722;1 and detectivity (D*) of 4 &#215; 1011 Jones at 532&#160;nm. Moreover, PdPS exhibits good performance of polarization detection with dichroic ratio of &#8776;3.7 at 808&#160;nm. Significantly, it achieves polarimetric imaging and hidden&#8208;target detection in complex environments through active detection.

         <title>A Sodium&#8211;Antimony&#8211;Telluride Intermetallic Allows Sodium&#8208;Metal Cycling at 100% Depth of Discharge and as an Anode&#8208;Free Metal Battery</title>

         <dc:description>
A repeated rolling&#8211;folding method is employed to fabricate a unique metallurgical composite of sodium&#8211;antimony&#8211;telluride&#160;intermetallic crystallites that are&#160;densely dispersed in Na metal, which&#160;allows for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrochemical performance and achieves 100% depth&#8208;of&#8208;discharge. An in&#8208;depth mechanistic study regarding the interdependence of cluster and atom adsorption energies, metal film wetting behavior and dendrites, solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interphase growth, and the resultant electrochemical stability is demonstrated.








Abstract
Repeated cold rolling and folding is employed to fabricate a metallurgical composite of sodium&#8211;antimony&#8211;telluride Na2(Sb2/6Te3/6Vac1/6) dispersed in electrochemically active sodium metal, termed &#8220;NST&#8208;Na.&#8221; This new intermetallic has a vacancy&#8208;rich thermodynamically stable face&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic structure and enables state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrochemical performance in widely employed carbonate and ether electrolytes. NST&#8208;Na achieves 100% depth&#8208;of&#8208;discharge (DOD) in 1 m NaPF6 in G2, with 15 mAh cm&#8722;2 at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.4%, for 1000 h&#160;of plating/stripping. Sodium&#8208;metal batteries (SMBs) with NST&#8208;Na and Na3V2(PO4)3&#160;(NVP) or sulfur cathodes give significantly improved energy, cycling, and CE (&gt;99%). An anode&#8208;free battery with NST collector and NVP obtains 0.23% capacity decay per cycle. Imaging and tomography using conventional and cryogenic microscopy (Cryo&#8208;EM) indicate that the sodium metal fills the open space inside the self&#8208;supporting sodiophilic NST skeleton, resulting in dense (pore&#8208;free and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI)&#8208;free) metal deposits with flat surfaces. The baseline Na deposit consists of filament&#8208;like dendrites and &#8220;dead metal&#8221;, intermixed with pores and SEI. Density functional theory calculations show that the uniqueness of NST lies in the thermodynamic stability of the Na atoms (rather than clusters) on its surface that leads to planar wetting, and in its own stability that prevents decomposition during cycling.

         <title>Extracellular Matrix in Synthetic Hydrogel&#8208;Based Prostate Cancer Organoids Regulate Therapeutic Response to EZH2 and DRD2 Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Neuroendocrine prostate cancer is epigenetically transformed tumors for which no targeted therapies exist. Using a combination of transcriptomics, proteomics, spatial omics, and microscopy on patient biopsies, the extracellular matrix tumor microenvironment is defined. Informed by findings, synthetic hydrogel&#8208;based prostate cancer organoids are developed to grow patient tumor cells under the defined microenvironment conditions, leading to the discovery of novel therapeutics.








Abstract
Following treatment with androgen receptor (AR) pathway inhibitors, &#8776;20% of prostate cancer patients progress by shedding their AR&#8208;dependence. These tumors undergo epigenetic reprogramming turning castration&#8208;resistant prostate cancer adenocarcinoma (CRPC&#8208;Adeno) into neuroendocrine prostate cancer (CRPC&#8208;NEPC). No targeted therapies are available for CRPC&#8208;NEPCs, and there are minimal organoid models to discover new therapeutic targets against these aggressive tumors. Here, using a combination of patient tumor proteomics, RNA sequencing, spatial&#8208;omics, and a synthetic hydrogel&#8208;based organoid, putative extracellular matrix (ECM) cues that regulate the phenotypic, transcriptomic, and epigenetic underpinnings of CRPC&#8208;NEPCs are defined. Short&#8208;term culture in tumor&#8208;expressed ECM differentially regulated DNA methylation and mobilized genes in CRPC&#8208;NEPCs. The ECM type distinctly regulates the response to small&#8208;molecule inhibitors of epigenetic targets and Dopamine Receptor D2 (DRD2), the latter being an understudied target in neuroendocrine tumors. In vivo patient&#8208;derived xenograft in immunocompromised mice showed strong anti&#8208;tumor response when treated with a DRD2 inhibitor. Finally, we&#160;demonstrate that therapeutic response in CRPC&#8208;NEPCs under drug&#8208;resistant ECM conditions can be overcome by first cellular reprogramming with epigenetic inhibitors, followed by DRD2 treatment. The synthetic organoids suggest the regulatory role of ECM in therapeutic response to targeted therapies in CRPC&#8208;NEPCs and enable the discovery of therapies to overcome resistance.

         <title>Ultrathin 2D NbWO6 Perovskite Semiconductor Based Gas Sensors with Ultrahigh Selectivity under Low Working Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D all&#8208;inorganic NbWO6 perovskite nanosheets with thicknesses down to 1.5 nm are synthesized for the fabrication of gas sensors, and the fabricated few&#8208;layer NbWO6&#8208;based semiconducting sensor exhibits fast H2S sensing speed with high selectivity and sensitivity at low temperature.








Abstract
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) detection with high selectivity and low working temperature is of great significance due to its strong toxicity both to the environment and to humans and also as an endogenous signaling molecule existing in various physiological processes. 2D perovskites with high carrier mobility are promising candidates for gas sensing; however, the development of stable and nontoxic 2D perovskites nanosheets still remains a challenge. Herein, 2D all&#8208;inorganic NbWO6 perovskite nanosheets with thicknesses down to 1.5&#160;nm are synthesized by liquid exfoliation, and the gas&#8208;sensing performance based on these ultrathin nanosheets is investigated. A few&#8208;layer NbWO6&#8208;based sensor exhibits fast H2S sensing speed (&lt;6 s) with high selectivity and sensitivity (S&#160;= 12.5 vs 50&#160;ppm) at low temperature (150&#160;&#176;C). A small variation of H2S concentration (&lt;0.5&#160;ppm) can be detected with a fully reversible resistance signal. This work sheds light on the development of high&#8208;performance gas sensors working in ambient conditions based on low&#8208;dimensional, nontoxic, and wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite semiconductors. The high carrier mobility, ultrathin structure, and soft nature make this type of 2D perovskite semiconductor an ideal material candidate for the fabrication of flexible, transparent, and wearable sensing devices in the future.

         <title>Simultaneous Realization of Superoleophobicity and Strong Substrate Adhesion in Water via a Unique Segment Orientation Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and versatile noncovalent coating strategy is provided to simultaneously realize underwater superoleophobicity and strong substrate adhesion based on a mixture of amphiphilic polyurethane and a water&#8208;miscible solvent. By immersing the coating in water, hydrophobic segments will orientate and pile along the substrate surface via a segment orientation mechanism. Hydrophilic segments will physically crosslink to a hydrogel surface.








Abstract
The underwater superoleophobicity of a coating is often caused by its preferential water affinity, which, however, normally weakens the substrate adhesion property. In this work, a new strategy is reported for achieving strong underwater adhesion between a well&#8208;designed amphiphilic polyurethane coating and a diverse range of substrates while also rendering the coating surface's superoleophobicity. When the coating, which is a mixture of an amphiphilic polyurethane and a water miscible solvent, is immersed in water, the hydrophobic segments aggregate to orientate and pile along the surface of substrates via a segment orientation mechanism triggered by solvent exchange with water penetration to exert strong adhesion. At the same time, the hydrophilic segments will physically crosslink to form a hydrogel coating, endowing the substrate with underwater superoleophobicity. This work provides a facile, versatile, and scalable approach for the future design of superoleophobic coatings in a water environment.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic&#8208;Framework&#8208;Based Hydrogen&#8208;Release Platform for Multieffective Helicobacter Pylori Targeting Therapy and Intestinal Flora Protective Capabilities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8211;organic&#8208;framework&#8208;based hydrogen&#8208;generation platform for the treatment of H. pylori is reported. This platform integrates inflammatory targeted adhesion, multieffectively antibacterial capability, inflammatory regulation, and gastric mucosa repair, and also avoids simultaneously the imbalance of gastrointestinal flora homeostasis.








Abstract
Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is the leading cause of chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer, and gastric cancer. Antibiotics, as traditional method for eliminating H. pylori, have no targeting effect, which causes serious bacterial resistance and gut dysbacteriosis. Moreover, antibiotics can hardly address hyperactive inflammatory response or damaged gastric mucosal barrier caused by H. pylori infection. Here, a pH&#8208;responsive metal&#8211;organic framework hydrogen&#8208;generation nanoparticle (Pd(H)&#8202;@&#8202;ZIF&#8208;8) is reported, which is encapsulated with ascorbate palmitate (AP) hydrogel. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate that the outer AP hydrogel can target and adhere to the inflammatory site through electrostatic interactions, and is then hydrolyzed by matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) enriching in inflammatory sites. The released Pd(H)&#8202;@&#8202;ZIF&#8208;8 nanoparticles are further decomposed by gastric acid to generate zinc ions (Zn2+) and hydrogen, thus effectively killing H. pylori, alleviating inflammation and restoring impaired gastric mucosa simultaneously. Unexpectedly, this metal&#8211;organic framework hydrogen&#8208;generation platform (Pd(H)&#8202;@&#8202;ZIF&#8208;8&#8202;@&#8202;AP) also has an effect toward avoiding the imbalance of intestinal flora, which thus provides a more precise, effective, and healthy strategy for the treatment of H. pylori infection.

         <title>Dynamic Ligand Screening by Magnetic Nanoassembly Modulates Stem Cell Differentiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic screens of various sizes are elastically coupled to RGD&#8208;presenting surfaces with nanogaps. Large magnetic screens exhibiting low RGD distribution stimulate integrin clustering for mechanotransduction&#8208;dependent differentiation of stem cells, which can be dynamically hindered by lowering the nanogaps. Conversely, small magnetic screens facilitate stem cell adhesion and differentiation by dynamically raising the nanogaps.








Abstract
In native microenvironment, diverse physical barriers exist to dynamically modulate stem cell recruitment and differentiation for tissue repair. In this study, nanoassembly&#8208;based magnetic screens of various sizes are utilized, and they are elastically tethered over an RGD ligand (cell&#8208;adhesive motif)&#8208;presenting material surface to generate various nanogaps between the screens and the RGDs without modulating the RGD density. Large screens exhibiting low RGD distribution stimulate integrin clustering to facilitate focal adhesion, mechanotransduction, and differentiation of stem cells, which are not observed with small screens. Magnetic downward pulling of the large screens decreases the nanogaps, which dynamically suppress the focal adhesion, mechanotransduction, and differentiation of stem cells. Conversely, magnetic upward pulling of the small screens increases the nanogaps, which dynamically activates focal adhesion, mechanotransduction, and differentiation of stem cells. This regulation mechanism is also shown to be effective in the microenvironment in vivo. Further diversifying the geometries of the physical screens can further enable diverse modalities of multifaceted and safe unscreening of the distributed RGDs to unravel and modulate stem cell differentiation for tissue repair.

         <title>Ultrafast Single&#8208;Crystal&#8208;to&#8208;Single&#8208;Crystal Transformation from Metal&#8211;Organic Framework to 2D Hydroxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is demonstrated that single crystallinity can be totally maintained even through dramatic structural changes, which only requires several seconds. Ultrathin 2D single crystals can be obtained by the strategy, which is difficult for traditional methods. This discovery illustrates the possibility of transforming from 3D frameworks to 2D inorganic single crystals, vastly expanding the research scope of the single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation.








Abstract
Single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) transformations have received considerable interest in crystal engineering, owing to providing a key platform for creating new materials. However, because of the limited tolerance of chemical bonds against the lattice strains, it is challenging to maintain the crystallinity when the structure changes dramatically. Here, a peculiar SCSC transformation from organic crystals to inorganic crystals, simultaneously achieving a drastic change in structure, connectivity, and dimension, is reported. As a demonstration, after reacting with liquid gallium, zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) can easily transform to 2D hydroxide single crystals. Interestingly, long&#8208;range ordered metallic atoms of hydroxide inherited from the ordered atomic arrangement of ZIF&#8208;8, but the connectivity is distinct. With good universality and extensibility, this transformation vastly expands the research scope of the SCSC transformations and provides a novel pathway for the synthesis of crystalline materials.

         <title>Nonvolatile Logic and Ternary Content&#8208;Addressable Memory Based on Complementary Black Phosphorus and Rhenium Disulfide Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small&#8208;footprint nonconventional computing&#8208;in&#8208;memory devices based on black phosphorus and rhenium disulfide are demonstrated. A logic inverter with a high gain of over 270 and retention of 1000 s with a Schmidt&#8208;like flip&#8208;flop feature is demonstrated by using only two transistors. Furthermore, a four&#8208;transistor nvTCAM cell with low processing temperature is realized with a high Rratio of &#8776;103.








Abstract
Hardware realization of in&#8208;memory computing for efficient data&#8208;intensive computation is regarded as a promising paradigm beyond the Moore era. However, to realize such functions, the device structure using traditional Si complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) technology is complex with a large footprint. 2D material&#8208;based heterostructures have a unique advantage to build versatile logic functions based on novel heterostructures with simplified device footprint and low power. Here, by adopting the charge&#8208;trapping mechanism between a black phosphorus (BP) channel and a phosphorus oxide (POx) layer, a nonvolatile CMOS logic circuit based on 2D BP and rhenium disulfide (ReS2) with a high voltage gain of &#8776;275 is realized with a persistent hysteresis window. A Schmidt&#8208;like flip&#8208;flop using only two transistors is also demonstrated, with far fewer transistor numbers than the conventional silicon counterpart, which usually requires six transistors. Furthermore, four&#8208;transistor (4T) nonvolatile ternary content&#8208;addressable memory (nvTCAM) cells are demonstrated with far fewer transistors for parallel data search. The nvTCAM cells exhibit high resistance ratios (Rratio) up to &#8776;103 between match and mismatch states with zero standby power thanks to the nonvolatility of the BP transistors. This back&#8208;end&#8208;of&#8208;line compatible nvTCAM shows advantages over other structures with reduced complexity and thermal budget.

         <title>In Situ Sprayed Starvation/chemodynamic Therapeutic Gel for Post&#8208;surgical Treatment of IDH1 Glioma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Complete resection of IDH1 (R132H) glioma is infeasible and the classic post&#8208;surgical chemo/radiotherapy suffers from high recurrence and low survival rate. IDH1 (R132H) cells are sensitive to low concentration of glucose and high concentration of reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to inherent metabolism reprograming. Hence, a starvation/chemodynamic therapeutic gel was developed to combat residual IDH1 (R132H) tumor cells after surgery. Briefly, glucose oxidase (GOx) is mineralized with manganese&#8208;doped calcium phosphate to form GOx@MnCaP nanoparticles, which were encapsulated into the fibrin gel (GOx@MnCaP@fibrin). After spraying gel in the surgical cavity, GOx catalyzed the oxidation of glucose in residual IDH1 (R132H) cells and produced H2O2. The generated H2O2 was further converted into highly lethal hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH) by Mn2+ mediated Fenton&#8208;like reaction to further kill the residual IDH1 (R132H) cells. The as&#8208;prepared starvation/chemodynamic therapeutic gel showed much higher therapeutic efficacy towards IDH1 (R132H) cells than IDH1 (WT) cells, and achieved long&#8208;term survival.

         <title>Overcoming Intensity Saturation in Nonlinear Multiple&#8208;Quantum&#8208;Well Metasurfaces for High&#8208;Efficiency Frequency Upconversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Engineered intersubband transitions in semiconductor heterostructures featuring multiple quantum wells (MQWs) have been shown to support record&#8208;high second&#8208;order nonlinear susceptibilities. By integrating these materials in metasurfaces with tailored optical resonances, it is possible to further enhance photonic interactions, yielding giant nonlinear responses in ultrathin devices. These metasurfaces form a promising platform for efficient nonlinear processes, including frequency upconversion of low&#8208;intensity thermal infrared radiation and harmonic generation, free of phase&#8208;matching constraints intrinsic to bulk nonlinear crystals. However, nonlinear saturation at moderately large pump intensities due to the transfer of electron population into excited subbands facilitated by strongly enhanced light&#8208;matter interactions in metasurfaces fundamentally limits their overall efficiency for various nonlinear&#160;processes.
Here the saturation limits of nonlinear MQW&#8208;based metasurfaces for mid&#8208;infrared frequency upconversion are significantly extended by optimizing their designs for excitation with a strong pump coherently coupled with unpopulated upper electron subbands. This counterintuitive pumping scheme, combined with tailored material and photonic engineering of the metasurface, avoids saturation at practical levels of continuous&#8208;wave pump intensities, yielding significantly larger upconversion efficiencies than in conventional approaches. The present results open new opportunities for nonlinear metasurfaces, less limited by saturation mechanisms, with important implications for night&#8208;vision imaging and compact nonlinear wave mixing&#160;systems.

         <title>Immune Checkpoint Ligand&#8208;Bioengineered Schwann Cells as Antigen&#8208;Specific Therapy for Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis</title>

Abstract
Failure to establish immune tolerance leads to the development of autoimmune disease. The ability to regulate autoreactive T cells without inducing systemic immunosuppression represents a major challenge to develop new strategies to treat autoimmune disease. Here, we describe a translational method for bioengineering programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 and cluster of differentiation 86&#8208;functionalized mouse Schwann cells to prevent and ameliorate multiple sclerosis in established mouse models of chronic and relapsing&#8208;remitting experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). We show here that the intravenous administration of immune checkpoint ligand&#8208;functionalized mouse Schwann cells modifies the course of disease and ameliorates EAE. Further, we found that such bioengineered mouse Schwann cells inhibit the differentiation of myelin&#8208;specific helper T cells into pathogenic T helper type 1 and type 17 cells, promote the development of tolerogenic myelin&#8208;specific regulatory T cells and resolve inflammatory CNS microenvironments without inducing systemic immunosuppression.

         <title>Simultaneous Large Optical and Piezoelectric Effects Induced by Domain Reconfiguration Related to Ferroelectric Phase Transitions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Electrical switching of ferroelectric domains and subsequent domain wall motion promotes strong piezoelectric activity; however, light scatters at refractive index discontinuities such as those found at domain wall boundaries. Thus, simultaneously achieving large piezoelectric effect and high optical transmissivity is generally deemed infeasible. Here, it is demonstrated that the ferroelectric domains in perovskite Pb(In1/2Nb1/2)O3 Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3&#8208;PbTiO3 domain&#8208;engineered crystals can be manipulated by electrical field and mechanical stress to reversibly and repeatably, with small hysteresis, transform the opaque poly&#8208;domain structure into a highly transparent mono&#8208;domain state. This control of optical properties can be achieved at very low electric fields (less than 1.5&#160;kV cm&#8722;1) and is accompanied by a large (&gt;10000 pm V&#8722;1) piezoelectric coefficient that is superior to that of linear state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art materials by a factor of three or more. The coexistence of tunable optical transmissivity and high piezoelectricity paves the way for a new class of photonic devices.

         <title>Sodium&#8208;Doped Titania Self&#8208;Rectifying Memristor for Crossbar Array Neuromorphic Architectures</title>

Abstract
Memristors integrated into a crossbar array architecture (CAA) are promising candidates for non&#8208;volatile memory elements in artificial neural networks (ANN). However, the relatively low reliability of memristors coupled with crosstalk and sneak currents in CAAs have limited the realization of the full potential of this technology. Here, we&#160;demonstrate high&#8208;reliability Na&#8208;doped TiO2 memristors grown in&#8208;situ by atomic layer deposition (ALD) where reversible Na migration underlies the resistive switching mechanism. By employing ALD growth with an aqueous NaOH reactant in deionized water, uniform implantation of Na dopants is achieved in the crystallized TiO2 thin films at 250 &#8451; without post&#8208;annealing. The resulting Na&#8208;doped TiO2 memristors show electroforming&#8208;free and self&#8208;rectifying resistive switching behavior that are ideally suited for selectorless CAAs. Effective addressing of selectorless nodes is demonstrated via electrical measurement of individual memristors in a 6&#215;6&#160;crossbar using a read current of less than 1 &#956;A with negligible sneak current at or below the noise level of &#8764;100 pA. Finally, the long&#8208;term potentiation and depression synaptic behavior from these Na&#8208;doped TiO2 memristors achieves greater than 99.1% accuracy for image recognition tasks using a convolutional neural network based on the selectorless of crossbar arrays.

         <title>Chlorination Enabling a Low&#8208;cost Benzodithiophene&#8208;based Wide&#8208;bandgap Donor Polymer with an Efficiency of over 17%</title>

Abstract
Three regio&#8208;regular benzodithiophene&#8208;based donor&#8211;donor (D&#8211;D)&#8208;type polymers (PBDTT, PBDTT1Cl, and PBDTT2Cl) are designed, synthesized, and used as donor materials in organic solar cells (OSCs). Because of the weak intramolecular charge transfer effect, these polymers exhibit large optical bandgaps (&gt;2.0&#160;eV). Among these three polymers, PBDTT1Cl exhibits more ordered and closer molecular stacking, and its devices demonstrate higher and more balanced charge mobilities and a longer charge separated (CS) state lifetime. As a result of these comprehensive benefits, PBDTT1Cl&#8208;based OSCs give a very impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.10% with a low nonradiative energy loss (0.19&#160;eV). Moreover, PBDTT1Cl also possesses a low figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit (FOM) value and good universality to match with different acceptors. Our work provides a simply and efficient strategy to design low&#8208;cost high&#8208;performance polymer donor materials.

         <title>Bioinks and bioprinting strategies for skeletal muscle tissue engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Skeletal muscles play important roles in critical body functions and their injury or diseases can lead to limitation of mobility and loss of independence. Current treatment modalities result in variable functional recovery, while reconstructive surgery, as the gold standard approach, is limited due to donor shortage, donor site morbidity and limited functional recovery. Skeletal muscle tissue engineering (SMTE) has generated enthusiasm as an alternative solution for treatment of diseased or lost tissue and serve as functional disease models. In recent years, bioprinting has emerged as a promising tool for recapitulating the complex and highly organized architecture of skeletal muscles at clinically relevant sizes. Here, we discuss skeletal muscle physiology, muscle regeneration following injury, current treatments following muscle loss, and then critically review bioprinting strategies implemented for SMTE. Subsequently, we discuss recent advancements that have led to improvement of bioprinting strategies to construct large muscle structures, boost myogenesis in vitro and in vivo, and enhance tissue integration. Bioinks for muscle bioprinting, as an essential part of any bioprinting strategy, are discussed and their benefits, limitations, and areas to be improved are highlighted. Finally, the directions that field should expand to make bioprinting strategies more translational and overcome the clinical unmet needs are discussed.

         <title>Cell Sheet&#8208;like Soft Nanoreactor Arrays</title>

Abstract
Tissues, which consist of groups of closely packed cell arrays, are essentially sheet&#8208;like biosynthesis plants. In tissues, individual cells are discrete microreactors working under highly viscous and confined environments. This paper reports on soft polystyrene&#8208;encased nanoframe (PEN) reactor arrays as analogous nanoscale &#8220;sheet&#8208;like chemosynthesis plants&#8221; for the controlled synthesis of novel nanocrystals. Although the soft polystyrene (PS) was only 3&#160;nm thick, it was elastic, robust, and permeable to aqueous solutes, while significantly slowing down their diffusion. PEN&#8208;associated palladium (Pd) crystallization followed a diffusion&#8208;controlled zero&#8208;order kinetics rather than a reaction&#8208;controlled first&#8208;order kinetics in bulk solution. Each individual PEN reactor had a volume in the zeptoliter range, which offered a unique confined environment, enabling a directional inward crystallization, in contrast to the conventional outward nucleation/growth that occurs in an unconfined bulk solution. This strategy made it possible to generate a set of mono&#8208;, bi&#8208;, trimetallic, and even semiconductor nanocrystals with tunable interior structures, which are difficult to achieve with normal systems based on bulk solutions.

         <title>High Miscibility Compatible with Ordered Molecular Packing Enables an Excellent Efficiency of 16.2% in All&#8208;small&#8208;molecule Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
In all&#8208;small&#8208;molecule organic solar cells (ASM&#8208;OSCs), a high short circuit current (Jsc) usually needs a small phase separation, while a high fill factor (FF) is generally realized in a highly ordered packing system. However, small domain and ordered packing always contracted each other in ASM&#8208;OSCs, leading to a mutually restricted Jsc and FF. In this study, we propose alleviating the previous dilemma by the strategy of obtaining simultaneous good miscibility and ordered packing through modulating homo&#8208; and hetero&#8208; molecular interaction. By moving the alkyl&#8208;thiolation side chains from para&#8208; to meta&#8208;position in the small&#8208;molecule donor, the surface tension and molecular planarity are synchronously enhanced, resulting in compatible properties of good miscibility with acceptor BTP&#8208;eC9 and strong self&#8208;assemble ability. As a result, an optimized morphology with multi&#8208;length scale domains and highly ordered packing is realized. The device exhibits a long carrier lifetime (39.8 us) and fast charge collection (15.5&#160;ns). A record efficiency of 16.2% with a high FF of 75.6% and a Jsc of 25.4&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in the ASM&#8208;OSCs is obtained. These results demonstrate that the strategy of simultaneously obtaining good miscibility with high crystallinity could be an efficient photovoltaic material design principle for high performance ASM&#8208;OSCs.

In this study, we propose alleviating the previous dilemma by the strategy of obtaining simultaneous good miscibility and ordered packing through modulating homo- and hetero- molecular interaction. By moving the alkyl-thiolation side chains from para- to meta-position in the small-molecule donor, the surface tension and molecular planarity are synchronously enhanced, resulting in compatible properties of good miscibility with acceptor BTP-eC9 and strong self-assemble ability. As a result, an optimized morphology with multi-length scale domains and highly ordered packing is realized. The device exhibits a long carrier lifetime (39.8 us) and fast charge collection (15.5&#160;ns). A record efficiency of 16.2% with a high FF of 75.6% and a &lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;

         <title>Tuning the Transport Properties of Gases in Porous Graphene Membranes with Controlled Pore Size and Thickness</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Porous graphene membranes emerged as promising alternatives for gas separation applications due to their atomic thickness enabling ultra&#8208;high permeance, but suffer from low gas selectivity. Whereas decreasing the pore size below 3&#160;nm is expected to increase the gas selectivity due to molecular sieving, it is rather challenging to generate large number of uniform small pores on the graphene surface. Here, we introduce a pore narrowing approach via gold deposition onto porous graphene surface to tune the pore size and thickness of the membrane to achieve large number of small pores. Through our systematic approach, we determined the ideal combination as pore size below 3&#160;nm obtained at the thickness of 100&#160;nm to attain high selectivity and high permeance. The resulting membrane showed a H2/CO2 separation factor of 31.3 at H2 permeance of 2.23&#160;&#215; 105 GPU (1 GPU = 3.35&#160;&#215; 10&#8722;10&#160;mol s&#8722;1 m&#8722;2 Pa&#8722;1), which is the highest value reported to date in the 105 GPU permeance range. This result is explained by comparing the predicted binding energies of gas molecules with the Au surface, &#8208;5.3&#160;versus &#8208;21&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1 for H2 and CO2, respectively, increased surface&#8208;gas interactions and molecular sieving effect with decreasing pore size.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Porous graphene membranes emerged as promising alternatives for gas separation applications due to their atomic thickness enabling ultra-high permeance, but suffer from low gas selectivity. Whereas decreasing the pore size below 3&#160;nm is expected to increase the gas selectivity due to molecular sieving, it is rather challenging to generate large number of uniform small pores on the graphene surface. Here, we introduce a pore narrowing approach via gold deposition onto porous graphene surface to tune the pore size and thickness of the membrane to achieve large number of small pores. Through our systematic approach, we determined the ideal combination as pore size below 3&#160;nm obtained at the thickness of 100&#160;nm to attain high selectivity and high permeance. The resulting membrane showed a H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separation factor of 31.3 at H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; permeance of 2.23&#160;&#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; GPU (1 GPU = 3.35&#160;&#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;10&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;mol s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; Pa&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), which is the highest value reported to date in the 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; GPU permeance range. This result is explained by comparing the predicted binding energies of gas molecules with the Au surface, -5.3&#160;versus -21&#160;kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively, increased surface-gas interactions and molecular sieving effect with decreasing pore size.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Colloidal Metal&#8208;Halide Perovskite Nanoplatelets: Thickness&#8208;Controlled Synthesis, Properties and Application in Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>

Abstract
Colloidal metal&#8208;halide perovskite nanocrystals (MHP NCs) are gaining significant attention for a wide range of optoelectronics applications owing to their exciting properties, such as defect tolerance, near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield, and tunable emission across the entire visible wavelength range. Although the optical properties of MHP NCs are easily tunable through their halide composition, they suffer from light&#8208;induced halide phase segregation that limits their use in devices. However, MHPs can be synthesized in the form of colloidal nanoplatelets (NPls) with monolayer (ML)&#8208;level thickness control, exhibiting strong quantum confinement effects, and thus enabling tunable emission across the entire visible wavelength range by controlling the thickness of bromide or iodide&#8208;based lead&#8208;halide perovskite NPls. In addition, the NPls exhibit narrow emission peaks, have high exciton binding energies, and a higher fraction of radiative recombination compared to their bulk counterparts, making them ideal candidates for applications in light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). This review discusses the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in colloidal MHP NPls: synthetic routes, thickness&#8208;controlled synthesis of both organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid and all&#8208;inorganic MHP NPls, their linear and nonlinear optical properties (including charge&#8208;carrier dynamics), and their performance in LEDs. Furthermore, the challenges associated with their thickness&#8208;controlled synthesis, environmental and thermal stability, and their application in making efficient LEDs are discussed.

         <title>Deterministic Shallow Dopant Implantation in Silicon with Detection Confidence Upper&#8208;Bound to 99.85% by Ion&#8211;Solid Interactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
On&#8208;chip electrodes are employed to signal near&#8208;surface single&#8208;ion implantation in silicon. A physical model of the signals provides insights into the ion stopping trajectories within the silicon chip and reveals greater than 99.8% single&#8208;ion&#8208;detection confidence. The study demonstrates the feasibility of controlled scalable dopant architecture engineering for classical and quantum silicon devices.








Abstract
Silicon chips containing arrays of single dopant atoms can be the material of choice for classical and quantum devices that exploit single donor spins. For example, group&#8208;V donors implanted in isotopically purified 28Si crystals are attractive for large&#8208;scale quantum computers. Useful attributes include long nuclear and electron spin lifetimes of 31P, hyperfine clock transitions in 209Bi or electrically controllable 123Sb nuclear spins. Promising architectures require the ability to fabricate arrays of individual near&#8208;surface dopant atoms with high yield. Here, an on&#8208;chip detector electrode system with 70&#160;eV root&#8208;mean&#8208;square noise (&#8776;20 electrons) is employed to demonstrate near&#8208;room&#8208;temperature implantation of single 14&#160;keV 31P+ ions. The physics model for the ion&#8211;solid interaction shows an unprecedented upper&#8208;bound single&#8208;ion&#8208;detection confidence of 99.85 &#177; 0.02% for near&#8208;surface implants. As a result, the practical controlled silicon doping yield is limited by materials engineering factors including surface gate oxides in which detected ions may stop. For a device with 6&#160;nm gate oxide and 14&#160;keV 31P+ implants, a yield limit of 98.1% is demonstrated. Thinner gate oxides allow this limit to converge to the upper&#8208;bound. Deterministic single&#8208;ion implantation can therefore be a viable materials engineering strategy for scalable dopant architectures in silicon devices.

         <title>Air&#8208;Stable 2D Cr5Te8 Nanosheets with Thickness&#8208;Tunable Ferromagnetism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D ferromagnetism Cr5Te8 single crystals with high crystallinity are successfully synthesized via a tube&#8208;in&#8208;tube chemical vapor deposition growth. The as&#8208;grown Cr5Te8 nanosheet shows air&#8208;stable and thickness&#8208;tunable ferromagnetic properties with strong out&#8208;of&#8208;plane spin polarization, which open up new prospects for exploring 2D magnetism and spintronic device applications.








Abstract
2D magnetic materials have aroused widespread research interest owing to their promising application in spintronic devices. However, exploring new kinds of 2D magnetic materials with better stability and realizing their batch synthesis remain challenging. Herein, the synthesis of air&#8208;stable 2D Cr5Te8 ultrathin crystals with tunable thickness via tube&#8208;in&#8208;tube chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth technology is reported. The importance of tube&#8208;in&#8208;tube CVD growth, which can significantly suppress the equilibrium shift to the decomposition direction and facilitate that to the synthesis reaction direction, for the synthesis of high&#8208;quality Cr5Te8 with accurate composition, is highlighted. By precisely adjusting the growth temperature, the thickness of Cr5Te8 nanosheets is tuned from &#8776;1.2&#160;nm to tens of nanometers, with the morphology changing from triangles to hexagons. Furthermore, magneto&#8208;optical Kerr effect measurements reveal that the Cr5Te8 nanosheet is ferromagnetic with strong out&#8208;of&#8208;plane spin polarization. The Curie temperature exhibits a monotonic increase from 100 to 160 K as the Cr5Te8 thickness increases from 10 to 30&#160;nm and no apparent variation in surface roughness or magnetic properties after months of exposure to air. This study provides a robust method for the controllable synthesis of high&#8208;quality 2D ferromagnetic materials, which will facilitate research progress in spintronics.

Abstract
The charge carrier dynamics in organic solar cells and organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid metal halide perovskite solar cells, two leading technologies in thin&#8208;film photovoltaics, are compared. The similarities and differences in charge generation, charge separation, charge transport, charge collection, and charge recombination in these two technologies are discussed, linking these back to the intrinsic material properties of organic and perovskite semiconductors, and how these factors impact on photovoltaic device performance is elucidated. In particular, the impact of exciton binding energy, charge transfer states, bimolecular recombination, charge carrier transport, sub&#8208;bandgap tail states, and surface recombination is evaluated, and the lessons learned from transient optical and optoelectronic measurements are discussed. This perspective thus highlights the key factors limiting device performance and rationalizes similarities and differences in design requirements between organic and perovskite solar cells.

         <title>Textured Electrodes: Manipulating Built&#8208;In Crystallographic Heterogeneity of Metal Electrodes via Severe Plastic Deformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The large crystallographic heterogeneity, e.g., broad orientational distribution, characteristic of commercial metal foils results in rough electrodeposit morphology in either metal plating/stripping processes. An accumulative roll bonding (ARB) methodology is reported to achieve uniform crystallographic control on macroscopic materials. Electrochemical analysis shows that ARB can produce large improvements in reversibility of metal anodes.








Abstract
Control of crystallography of metal electrodeposit films has recently emerged as a key to achieving long operating lifetimes in next&#8208;generation batteries. It is reported that the large crystallographic heterogeneity, e.g., broad orientational distribution, that appears characteristic of commercial metal foils, results in rough morphology upon plating/stripping. On this basis, an accumulative roll bonding (ARB) methodology&#8212;a severe plastic deformation process&#8212;is developed. Zn metal is used as a first example to interrogate the concept. It is demonstrated that the ARB process is highly effective in achieving uniform crystallographic control on macroscopic materials. After the ARB process, the Zn grains exhibit a strong (002) texture (i.e., [002]Zn//ND). The texture transitions from a classical bipolar pattern to a nonclassical unipolar pattern under large nominal strain eliminate the orientational heterogeneity of the foil. The strongly (002)&#8208;textured Zn remarkably improves the plating/stripping performance by nearly two orders of magnitude under practical conditions. The performance improvements are readily scaled to achieve pouch&#8208;type full batteries that deliver exceptional reversibility. The ARB process can, in principle, be applied to any metal chemistry to achieve similar crystallographic uniformity, provided the appropriate temperature and accumulated strains are employed. This concept is evaluated using commercial Li and Na foils, which, unlike Zn (HCP), are BCC crystals. The simple process for creating strong textures in both hexagonal and cubic metals and illustrating the critical role such built&#8208;in crystallography plays underscores opportunities for developing highly reversible thin metal anodes (e.g., hexagonal Zn, Mg, and cubic Li, Na, Ca, Al).

         <title>A Dynamic and Self&#8208;Adapting Interface Coating for Stable Zn&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy is proposed for constructing a dynamic and adaptive volume change interface coating to stabilize zinc anodes and prepare poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS)/TiO2&#8722;x as a reasonable artificial interface coating, which can provide continuous dynamic protection and induce rapid and uniform transfer of Zn2+. This provides an effective and feasible approach for the protection and practical application of zinc&#8208;metal anodes.








Abstract
The zinc (Zn)&#8208;ion battery has attracted much attention due to its high safety and environmental protection. At present, the critical issues of the generation of dendrites and the accumulation of dead Zn on the surface will lead to a sharp decline of the battery life. Zn dendrites can be inhibited to some extent by constructing an interface protective coating. However, the existing rigid coating method cannot maintain conformal contact with Zn due to the volume change of Zn deposition and will cause fracture irreversibly during the cycle. Here, a highly self&#8208;adaptable poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS)/TiO2&#8722;x coating is developed that can dynamically adapt to volume changes and inhibit dendrites growth. PDMS has high dynamic and self&#8208;adaptability due to the crosslinking of the B&#8211;O bond. In addition, the rapid and uniform transfer of Zn2+ is induced by the oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;rich TiO2&#8722;x. The assembled cells still achieve 99.6% coulombic efficiency after 700 cycles at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The adaptive interface coating constructed provides a sufficient guarantee for the stable operation of the Zn anode.

         <title>Asymmetric Elimination Reaction on Chiral Metal Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral intermetallic compounds are promising candidates to promote heterogeneous asymmetric catalysis. Combining experimental and theoretical surface science methods, enantiospecific control is demonstrated for a halogen elimination reaction with a difference in the debromination temperatures of the two surface enantiomers of up to an unprecedented 46 K on the prototypical chiral intermetallic PdGa{111} surfaces.








Abstract
The production of enantiopure materials and molecules is of uttermost relevance in research and industry in numerous contexts, ranging from nonlinear optics to asymmetric synthesis. In the context of the latter, dehalogenation, which is an essential reaction step for a broad class of chemical reactions, is investigated; specifically, dehalogenation of prochiral 5&#8208;bromo&#8208;7&#8208;methylbenz(a)anthracene (BMA) on prototypical, chiral, intermetallic PdGa{111} surfaces under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. Asymmetric halogen elimination is demonstrated by combining temperature&#8208;programmed X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning probe microscopy, and density functional theory. On the PdGa{111} surfaces, the difference in debromination temperatures for the two BMA surface enantiomers amounts up to an unprecedented 46 K. The significant dependence of the dehalogenation temperature of the BMA surface enantiomers on the atomic termination of the PdGa{111} surfaces implies that the ensemble effect is pronounced in this reaction step. These findings evidence enantiospecific control and hence promote intrinsically chiral crystals for asymmetric on&#8208;surface synthesis.

         <title>Liquid Gating meniscus&#8208;shaped Deformable Magnetoelastic Membranes with self&#8208;driven Regulation of gas/liquid Release</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Liquid gating membranes have been demonstrated to show unprecedented properties of dynamicity, stability, adaptivity, and stimulus&#8208;responsiveness. Most recently, smart liquid gating membranes have attracted increasing attention to bring some brand&#8208;new properties for real&#8208;world applications, and various environment&#8208;driven systems have been created. Here, a self&#8208;driven system of a smart liquid gating membrane is further developed, by designing a new liquid gating magnetoelastic membrane&#8208;based system with reversible meniscus&#8208;shaped deformations, and it is not subject to the complex gating liquid restriction of magnetorheological fluid. Compared with other systems, this magnetic responsive self&#8208;driven system has the advantage that it provides a universal and convenient way to realize active regulation of gas/liquid release. Experiments and theoretical calculations demonstrate the stability, the non&#8208;fouling behavior, and the tunability of the system. In addition, this system can be used to perfectly open and close gas transport, and the gating pressure threshold for the liquid release can be reduced under the same conditions. Based on the above capabilities, combined with the fast and three&#8208;dimensional contactless operation, it will be of benefit in fields ranging from visible gas/liquid mixture content monitoring and energy&#8208;saving multiphase separation, remote fluid release and beyond.

         <title>Anisotropic Foams Via Frontal Polymerization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The properties of foams, an important class of cellular solids, are most sensitive to the volume fraction and openness of its elementary compartments; size, shape, orientation, and the interconnectedness of the cells are other important design attributes. Control of these morphological traits would allow the tailored fabrication of useful materials including highly porous solids, anisotropic heat conductors, tough composites, among others. While approaches like ice templating has produced foams with elongated cells, there is a need for rapid, versatile, and energy efficient methods that also control the local order and macroscopic alignment of cellular elements. Here we describe a fast and convenient method to obtain anisotropic structural foams using frontal polymerization. We fabricated foams by curing mixtures of dicyclopentadiene and a physical blowing agent via frontal ring opening metathesis polymerization (FROMP). The materials were characterized using micro&#8208;computed tomography (Micro&#8208;CT) and an image analysis protocol to quantify morphological characteristics including volume fraction and anisotropy. The cellular structure, porosity, and hardness of the foams changed with blowing agent, concentration, and resin viscosity. Moreover, we used a full factorial combination of variables to correlate each parameter with the structure of the obtained foams. We found a strong correlation between the resin viscosity and the foam's cellular structure. Furthermore, a specific combination of input parameters controlled the transitions from (i) isotropic to anisotropic cellular structures, (ii) porous to non&#8208;porous, and (iii) soft to hard foams. Our results demonstrate the controlled production of foams with specific morphologies using the simple and efficient method of frontal polymerization. This work shows promise for creating foams with aligned cellular structures that allow anisotropic mass and energy transport properties in high performance structural solids.

This work shows promise for creating foams with aligned cellular structures that allow anisotropic mass and energy transport properties in high performance structural solids.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Two Birds with One Stone: Interfacial Engineering of Multifunctional Janus Separator for Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>

Abstract
Li dendrite growth and unsatisfactory sulfur cathode performance are two core problems that greatly restrict the practical applications of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs). Here, an all&#8208;in&#8208;one design concept for Janus separator enabled by the interfacial engineering strategy is proposed to improve the performance of LSBs. At the interface of anode/separator, the thin functionalized composite layer contains the high&#8208;elastic&#8208;modulus and high&#8208;thermal&#8208;conductivity boron nitride nanosheets and oxygen group&#8208;grafted cellulose nanofibers (BNNs@CNFs), which can effectively avoid the formation of &#8220;hot spot&#8221;, homogenize Li&#8208;ion flux, and suppress dendrite growth. Meanwhile, at the interface between separator and cathode, the high&#8208;density homogenously exposed Ru single atoms on the surface of reduced graphene oxide (rGO@Ru SAs) can &#8220;trap&#8221; the polysulfides and considerably reduce the activation energy to boost their conversion kinetics. Consequently, the LSBs show a high capacity of 460 mAh g&#8211;1 at 5 C and ultrastable cycling performance with an ultralow capacity decay rate of 0.046% per cycle over 800 cycles. To further demonstrate the practical prospect of our Janus separator, an assembled Li&#8208;S pouch cell using our Janus separator delivers a cell&#8208;level energy density of 310.2&#160;Wh kg&#8211;1. This study provides a promising strategy to simultaneously tackle the challenges facing metallic Li anode and sulfur cathode in LSBs.

&lt;p&gt;Li dendrite growth and unsatisfactory sulfur cathode performance are two core problems that greatly restrict the practical applications of lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs). Here, an all-in-one design concept for Janus separator enabled by the interfacial engineering strategy is proposed to improve the performance of LSBs. At the interface of anode/separator, the thin functionalized composite layer contains the high-elastic-modulus and high-thermal-conductivity boron nitride nanosheets and oxygen group-grafted cellulose nanofibers (BNNs@CNFs), which can effectively avoid the formation of &#8220;hot spot&#8221;, homogenize Li-ion flux, and suppress dendrite growth. Meanwhile, at the interface between separator and cathode, the high-density homogenously exposed Ru single atoms on the surface of reduced graphene oxide (rGO@Ru SAs) can &#8220;trap&#8221; the polysulfides and considerably reduce the activation energy to boost their conversion kinetics. Consequently, the LSBs show a high capacity of 460 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 5 C and ultrastable cycling performance with an ultralow capacity decay rate of 0.046% per cycle over 800 cycles.

         <title>Orientation Heredity in The Transformation of Two&#8208;Dimensional Epitaxial Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Controlling the lattice orientation is significant for both two&#8208;dimensional (2D) vdW layered and non&#8208;layered film growth process. Here we report a unique and universal phenomena termed lattice orientation heredity (LOH). The LOH enables product films (including 2D layered materials) to inherit the lattice orientation from reactant films in a chemical conversion process, excluding the requirement on the substrate lattice order. We demonstrate the process universality by investigating the lattice transformations in the carbonization, nitridation, and sulfurization of epitaxial MoO2, ZnO, and In2O3 thin films. Their resultant compounds all inherit mono&#8208;oriented feature from their precursor oxides, including 2D vdW layered semiconductors (e.g., MoS2), metallic films (e.g., MXene&#8208;like Mo2C and MoN), wide bandgap semiconductors (e.g., hexagonal ZnS), and ferroelectric semiconductors (e.g., In2S3). Using LOH&#8208;grown MoN as a seeding layer, we achieved mono&#8208;oriented GaN on an amorphous quartz substrate. The LOH process is a universal strategy capable of growing epitaxial thin films (including 2D vdW layered materials) not only on single&#8208;crystalline but also the non&#8208;crystalline.

         <title>Strong &#960;&#8722;&#960; Stacking Stabilized Nanophotosensitizers: Improving Tumor Retention for Enhanced Therapy to Large Tumor in Mice</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Conventional photosensitizers (PSs) often show poor tumor retention and are rapidly cleared from the bloodstream, which is one of the key hindrances to guarantee precise and efficient photodynamic therapy (PDT) in vivo. In this work, we present a photosensitizer assembly nanosystem that sharply enhances tumor retention up to &#8764;10 days. The PSs are synthesized by meso&#8208;substituting anthracene onto the BODIPY scaffold (AN&#8208;BDP), which then self&#8208;assemble into stable nanoparticles (AN&#8208;BDP NPs) with amphiphilic block copolymers due to the strong intermolecular &#960;&#8722;&#960; interaction of anthracene. Additionally, the incorporated anthracene excites the PSs, producing singlet oxygen under red light irradiation. Although AN&#8208;BDP NPs could completely suppress regular test size tumor (&#8764;100 mm3) by one&#8208;time radiation, only 12% tumour growth inhibition rate was observed in the case of large size tumor (&#8764;350 mm3) under the same conditions. Due to the long time tumor retention, AN&#8208;BDP NPs allows single&#8208;dose injection and three&#8208;time light treatments, resulting in an over 90% inhibition rate, much more efficient than single&#8208;time radiation of conventional clinically used PSs including chlorin (Ce6) and porphyrin with poor tumor retention. The results reveal the importance of long tumor retention time of PSs for efficient PDT, which can accelerate the clinical development of nanophotosensitizers.

         <title>Boosting Piezoelectricity Under Illumination via the Bulk Photovoltaic Effect and the Schottky Barrier Effect in BiFeO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Piezoelectricity is a key functionality induced by conversion between mechanical and electrical energy. Enhancement of piezoelectricity in ferroelectrics often has been realized by complicated synthetical approaches to host unique structural boundaries, so&#8208;called morphotropic phase boundaries. While structural approaches have been well&#8208;known, enhancing piezoelectricity by external stimuli has yet to be clearly explored despite their advantages of offering not only simple and in&#8208;situ control without any prior processing requirement, but compatibility with other functionalities. Here, we show that light is a powerful control parameter to enhance the piezoelectric property of a BiFeO3 single crystal. Our series of PFM and C&#8208;AFM based measurements under illumination reveal a locally enhanced effective piezoelectric coefficient, dzz, eventually showing almost a seven&#8208;fold increase. We explain this phenomenon with theoretical models by introducing the two main underlying mechanisms attributed to the bulk photovoltaic effect and Schottky barrier effect, involving the role of open circuit voltage and photocharge carrier density. These results provide key insights to light&#8208;induced piezoelectricity enhancement, offering its potential for multifunctional optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Annealing Accelerator for Ising Spin Systems based on In&#8208;memory Complementary 2D FETs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Metaheuristic algorithms such as simulated annealing (SA) has been implemented for optimization in combinatorial problems, especially for discreet problems. SA employs a stochastic search, where high&#8208;energy transitions (&#8220;hill&#8208;climbing&#8221;) are allowed with a temperature&#8208;dependent probability to escape local optima. Ising spin glass systems have properties such as spin disorder and &#8220;frustration&#8221; and provide a discreet combinatorial problem with high number of metastable states and ground&#8208;state degeneracy. In this work, we exploit subthreshold Boltzmann transport in complementary two&#8208;dimensional (2D) field effect transistors (p&#8208;type WSe2 and n&#8208;type MoS2) integrated with analog, non&#8208;volatile, and programmable floating&#8208;gate memory stack to develop in&#8208;memory computing primitives necessary for energy and area efficient hardware acceleration of SA for the Ising spin systems. We experimentally demonstrate &gt;&#160;800X search acceleration for 4 &#215; 4 ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and a spin glass system using SA compared to an exhaustive search using brute force trial at miniscule total energy expenditure of &#8764;120 nJ. Our hardware&#8208;realistic numerical simulations further highlight the astounding benefits of SA in accelerating the search for larger spin lattices.

         <title>Lattice Polarity Manipulation of Quasi&#8208;vdW Epitaxial GaN Films on Graphene Through Interface Atomic Configuration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Quasi van der Waals (vdW) epitaxy, a pioneering epitaxy of sp3&#8208;hybridized semiconductor films on sp2&#8208;hybridized two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials, provides a way, in principle, to achieve single&#8208;crystal epilayers with preferred atom configurations that are free of substrate. Unfortunately, this has not been experimentally confirmed in the case of the hexagonal semiconductor III&#8208;nitride epilayer until now. Here, for the first time, we report that the epitaxy of gallium nitride (GaN) on graphene can tune the atom arrangement (lattice polarity) through manipulation of the interface atomic configuration, where GaN films with gallium and nitrogen polarity were achieved by forming C&#8208;O&#8208;N&#8208;Ga(3) or C&#8208;O&#8208;Ga&#8208;N(3) configurations, respectively, on artificial C&#8208;O surface dangling bonds by atomic oxygen preirradiation on trilayer graphene. Furthermore, an aluminum nitride (AlN) buffer/interlayer leads to unique metal polarity due to the formation of an AlON thin layer in a growth environment containing trace amounts of oxygen, which explains the open question why those reported wurtzite III&#8208;nitride films on 2D materials always exhibit metal polarity. The reported atomic modulation through interface manipulation provides an effective model for hexagonal nitride semiconductor layer grown on graphene, which definitely promotes the development of novel semiconductor devices.

         <title>3D Printed MXene Aerogels with Truly 3D Macrostructure and Highly Engineered Microstructure for Enhanced Electrical and Electrochemical Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D printing method based on inkjet printing and unidirectional freeze casting is utilized to fabricate pristine Ti3C2Tx aerogels with truly 3D shapes and vertically aligned MXene sheets. 3D printed aerogels are proposed for flexible/wearable electronics due to their excellent electromechanical performance. Enhanced electrochemical performance of the micro&#8208;supercapacitors is attributed to the improved electrical conductivity and ionic diffusion achieved simultaneously.








Abstract
Assembling 2D materials such as MXenes into functional 3D aerogels using 3D printing technologies gains attention due to simplicity of fabrication, customized geometry and physical properties, and improved performance. Also, the establishment of straightforward electrode fabrication methods with the aim to hinder the restack and/or aggregation of electrode materials, which limits the performance of the electrode, is of great significant. In this study, unidirectional freeze casting and inkjet&#8208;based 3D printing are combined to fabricate macroscopic porous aerogels with vertically aligned Ti3C2Tx sheets. The fabrication method is developed to easily control the aerogel microstructure and alignment of the MXene sheets. The aerogels show excellent electromechanical performance so that they can withstand almost 50% compression before recovering to the original shape and maintain their electrical conductivities during continuous compression cycles. To enhance the electrochemical performance, an inkjet&#8208;printed MXene current collector layer is added with horizontally aligned MXene sheets. This combines the superior electrical conductivity of the current collector layer with the improved ionic diffusion provided by the porous electrode. The cells fabricated with horizontal MXene sheets alignment as current collector with subsequent vertical MXene sheets alignment layers show the best electrochemical performance with thickness&#8208;independent capacitive behavior.

         <title>Ultrafast&#8208;Response/Recovery Flexible Piezoresistive Sensors with DNA&#8208;Like Double Helix Yarns for Epidermal Pulse Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hysteresis is a critical issue existing in textiles sensors. Distinct from the conventional methods, in this work, a biomimetic DNA&#8208;like double&#8208;helix structure is introduced into a textile&#8208;based pressure sensor, providing a twisting force to allow quick and sufficient recovery from the deformation. Ultimately, the hysteresis is largely inhibited together with an improved response/relaxation time.








Abstract
A key challenge in textile sensors is to adequately solve the hysteresis for more broad and exacting applications. Unlike the conventional strategy in integrating elastic polymers into the textile, the hysteretic issue is critically addressed here through the structural design of yarns to provide a twisting force. The underlying mechanism is fully discussed based on theory and modeling, which are in good agreement with experimental data. Impressively, the pressure sensor outperforms almost all reported textile&#8208;based sensors in terms of recovery index, which refers to the ability to overcome the lagged deformation reflected by the hysteresis (5.3%) and relaxation time (2&#160;ms). Besides, the sensor superiority is also demonstrated by way of its ultrafast response time (2&#160;ms). Thanks to these merits, this pressure sensor is demonstrated to be capable of monitoring epidermal pulses and meanwhile shows great potential to advance the standardization and modernization of pulse palpation in traditional Chinese medicine.

         <title>Natural Polymer in Soft Electronics: Opportunities, Challenges, and Future Prospects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Produced and modified by living organisms, natural polymers are credible alternatives to synthetic polymers ascribing to their biodegradability, biocompatibility, and capability in interfacing with cutting&#8208;edge technologies. The adoption of natural polymers in soft electronic devices is discussed, and the key challenges in polymer&#8208;to&#8208;conductor integration, device stability, biodegradation, and their environmental impact are addressed.








Abstract
Pollution caused by nondegradable plastics has been a serious threat to environmental sustainability. Natural polymers, which can degrade in nature, provide opportunities to replace petroleum&#8208;based polymers, meanwhile driving technological advances and sustainable practices. In the research field of soft electronics, regenerated natural polymers are promising building blocks for passive dielectric substrates, active dielectric layers, and matrices in soft conductors. Here, the natural&#8208;polymer polymorphs and their compatibilization with a variety of inorganic/organic conductors through interfacial bonding/intermixing and surface functionalization for applications in various device modalities are delineated. Challenges that impede the broad utilization of natural polymers in soft electronics, including limited durability, compromises between conductivity and deformability, and limited exploration in controllable degradation, etc. are explicitly inspected, while the potential solutions along with future prospects are also proposed. Finally, integrative considerations on material properties, device functionalities, and environmental impact are addressed to warrant natural polymers as credible alternatives to synthetic ones, and provide viable options for sustainable soft electronics.

         <title>Dimensional Design and Core&#8211;Shell Engineering of Nanomaterials for Electromagnetic Wave Absorption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Electromagnetic (EM) wave absorption materials possess exceptionally high EM energy loss efficiency. With vigorous developments in nanotechnology, such materials have exhibited numerous advanced EM functions, including radiation prevention and antiradar stealth. To achieve improved EM performance and multifunctionality, the elaborate control of microstructures has become an attractive research direction. By designing them as core&#8211;shell structures with different dimensions, the combined effects, such as interfacial polarization, conduction networks, magnetic coupling, and magnetic&#8211;dielectric synergy, can significantly enhance the EM wave absorption performance. This paper outlines the advances in low&#8208;dimensional core&#8211;shell EM wave absorption materials and discusses a selection of the most remarkable examples. It comprehensively summarizes the derived key information regarding dimensional design, structural engineering, performance, and structure&#8211;function relationship. Moreover, the investigation of cutting&#8208;edge mechanisms is given particular attention. Additional applications, such as oxidation resistance and self&#8208;cleaning functions, are also introduced. Finally, insight into what may be expected from this rapidly expanding field and future challenges are presented.

Abstract
Aqueous zinc ion batteries are regarded as ideal candidates for stationary energy storage systems due to their low cost and high safety. However, zinc can readily grow into dendrites, leading to limited cycling performance and quick failure of the batteries. Herein, we propose a novel strategy to mitigate this dendrite problem, in which selectively&#8208;polarized ferroelectric polymer material (poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF&#8208;TrFE))) is employed as a surface protective layer on zinc anodes. Such a polarized ferroelectric polymer layer could enable a locally&#8208;concentrated zinc ion distribution along the coated surface and thus enable the horizontal growth of zinc plates. As a result, symmetrical zinc batteries using such anodes exhibits long cycling lifespan at 0.2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, 0.2 mAh cm&#8722;2 for 2000 hours, and a high rate performance up to 15&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Also, the full cell (including Zn&#8208;MnO2 battery and zinc ion capacitor) based on this anode has been demonstrated. This work provides a novel strategy to protect the zinc anode and even other metal anodes exploiting polymer ferroelectricity.

         <title>Copper&#8208;free Click Chemistry: Applications in Drug Delivery, Cell Tracking and Tissue Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Traditionally, organic chemical reactions require organic solvents, toxic catalysts, heat, or high pressure. However, copper&#8208;free click chemistry has been shown to have favorable reaction rates and orthogonality in water, buffer solutions, and physiological conditions without toxic catalysts. Strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition and inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reactions are representative of copper&#8208;free click chemistry. Artificial chemical reactions via click chemistry can also be used outside of the laboratory in a controllable manner on live cell surfaces, in the cytosol, and in living bodies. Consequently, copper&#8208;free click chemistry has many features that are of interest in biomedical research, and various new materials and strategies for its use have been proposed. Herein, we describe recent remarkable trials that have used copper&#8208;free click chemistry, focusing on their applications in molecular imaging and therapy. We have categorized the research as nanoparticles for drug delivery, imaging agents for cell tracking, and hydrogels for tissue engineering, which are rapidly advancing fields based on click chemistry. The content is based primarily on our experience with click chemistry&#8208;based biomaterials over the last ten years.

         <title>Liquid Crystal Elastomer Metamaterials with Giant Biaxial Thermal Shrinkage for Enhancing Skin Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unique mechanics&#8208;guided designs and fabrication schemes of liquid crystal elastomer metamaterials that allow access to unprecedented biaxial actuation shrinkage and negative thermal expansion are developed. A low&#8208;temperature synthesis method enables excellent actuation performances at a substantially reduced temperature. Such a biocompatible metamaterial is integrated with a dressing to develop a shrinkable, hemostatic patch for enhancing skin regeneration.








Abstract
Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are a class of soft active materials of increasing interest, because of their excellent actuation and optical performances. While LCEs show biomimetic mechanical properties (e.g., elastic modulus and strength) that can be matched with those of soft biological tissues, their biointegrated applications have been rarely explored, in part, due to their high actuation temperatures (typically above 60&#160;&#176;C) and low biaxial actuation performances (e.g., actuation strain typically below 10%). Here, unique mechanics&#8208;guided designs and fabrication schemes of LCE metamaterials are developed that allow access to unprecedented biaxial actuation strain (&#8722;53%) and biaxial coefficient of thermal expansion (&#8722;33&#160;125&#160;ppm&#160;K&#8722;1), significantly surpassing those (e.g., &#8722;20% and &#8722;5950&#160;ppm&#160;K&#8722;1) reported previously. A low&#8208;temperature synthesis method with use of optimized composition ratios enables LCE metamaterials to offer reasonably high actuation stresses/strains at a substantially reduced actuation temperature (46&#160;&#176;C). Such biocompatible LCE metamaterials are integrated with medical dressing to develop a breathable, shrinkable, hemostatic patch as a means of noninvasive treatment. In vivo animal experiments of skin repair with both round and cross&#8208;shaped wounds demonstrate advantages of the hemostatic patch over conventional strategies (e.g., medical dressing and suturing) in accelerating skin regeneration, while avoiding scar and keloid generation.

         <title>In Situ Formation of Nano Ni&#8211;Co Oxyhydroxide Enables Water Oxidation Electrocatalysts Durable at High Current Densities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable synthesis method of nanocrystalline metal selenides is developed to achieve both high activity and stability of electrocatalysts used for water oxidation, important for green hydrogen production. The formation of defective and coordinatively unsaturated sites by milling at cryogenic temperatures facilitates the hydration of metal sites to form active nanosized oxyhydroxides.








Abstract
The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) limits the energy efficiency of electrocatalytic systems due to the high overpotential symptomatic of poor reaction kinetics; this problem worsens over time if the performance of the OER electrocatalyst diminishes during operation. Here, a novel synthesis of nanocrystalline Ni&#8211;Co&#8211;Se using ball milling at cryogenic temperature is reported. It is discovered that, by anodizing the Ni&#8211;Co&#8211;Se structure during OER, Se ions leach out of the original structure, allowing water molecules to hydrate Ni and Co defective sites, and the nanoparticles to evolve into an active Ni&#8211;Co oxyhydroxide. This transformation is observed using operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, with the findings confirmed using density functional theory calculations. The resulting electrocatalyst exhibits an overpotential of 279&#160;mV at 0.5 A cm&#8722;2 and 329&#160;mV at 1 A cm&#8722;2 and sustained performance for 500 h. This is achieved using low mass loadings (0.36&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) of cobalt. Incorporating the electrocatalyst in an anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer yields a current density of 1 A cm&#8722;2 at 1.75&#160;V for 95 h without decay in performance. When the electrocatalyst is integrated into a CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethylene electrolyzer, a record&#8208;setting full cell voltage of 3&#160;V at current density 1 A cm&#8722;2 is achieved.

         <title>Bioinspired Multifunctional Photonic&#8208;Electronic Smart Skin for Ultrasensitive Health Monitoring, for Visual and Self&#8208;Powered Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrasensitive self&#8208;powered mechanoluminescence smart skin (SPMSS) with bioinspired strain&#8208;dependent micro crack structure is designed and fabricated. The SPMSS demonstrates ultrasensitive sensing performances including ultralow detection limit, ultrahigh sensitivity, and ultrafast response. The SPMSS displays tunable and highly sensitive mechanoluminescence features for visual sensing and exhibits excellent triboelectric nanogenerator properties for reliable power source supply and self&#8208;powered sensing.








Abstract
Smart skin is highly desired to be ultrasensitive and self&#8208;powered as the medium of artificial intelligence. Here, an ultrasensitive self&#8208;powered mechanoluminescence smart skin (SPMSS) inspired by the luminescence mechanism of cephalopod skin and the ultrasensitive response of spider&#8208;slit&#8208;organ is developed. Benefitting from the unique strain&#8208;dependent microcrack structure design based on Ti3C2Tx (MXene)/carbon nanotube synergistic interaction, SPMSS possesses excellent strain sensing performances including ultralow detection limit (0.001% strain), ultrahigh sensitivity (gauge factor, GF = 3.92 &#215; 107), ultrafast response time (5&#160;ms), and superior durability and stability (&gt;45&#8201;000 cycles). Synchronously, SPMSS exhibits tunable and highly sensitive mechanoluminescence (ML) features under stretching. A relationship between ML features, strain sensing performances, and the deformation has been established successfully. Importantly, the SPMSS demonstrates excellent properties as triboelectric nanogenerator (4 &#215; 4 cm2), including ultrahigh triboelectric output (open&#8208;circuit voltage VOC&#160;= 540&#160;V, short&#8208;circuit current ISC&#160;= 42 &#181;A, short&#8208;circuit charge QSC&#160;= 317 nC) and power density (7.42 W m&#8722;2), endowing the smart skin with reliable power source supply and self&#8208;powered sensing ability. This bioinspired smart skin exhibits multifunctional applications in health monitoring, visual sensing, and self&#8208;powered sensing, showing great potential in artificial intelligence.

         <title>Synergistic Therapy of a Naturally Inspired Glycopolymer&#8208;Based Biomimetic Nanomedicine Harnessing Tumor Genomic Instability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the saccharide unit and its weak interactions and the combined advantages of branched polymers, glycopolymer&#8211;pyropheophorbide&#8208;a conjugates are optimized for enhanced photodynamic therapy (PDT), effective olaparib incorporation, and natural tumor cell membrane modified ability. The obtained biomimetic nanomedicine with homotypic cancer targeting ability achieves a prominent antitumor effect via harnessing tumor genomic instability, providing a platform strategy for synergistic nanomedicines combat with cancer.








Abstract
Inspired by natural saccharide&#8208;protein complexes, a stimuli&#8208;responsive biodegradable and branched glycopolymer&#8211;pyropheophorbide&#8208;a (Ppa) conjugate (BSP) with saccharide units for cancer therapy is constructed. A linear glycopolymeric conjugate (LSP), a branched glycopolymeric conjugate (BShP) from Ppa with long carbon chains, and a branched conjugate (BHSP) based on poly[N&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide] (polyHPMA) without saccharide units are prepared as controls. Through structure&#8211;activity relationship studies, BSP with a 3D network structure forms stable nanostructures via weak intermolecular interactions, regulating the stacking state of Ppa to improve the singlet oxygen quantum yield and the corresponding photodynamic therapy (PDT) effect. BSP shows high loading of olaparib, and are further coated with tumor cell membranes, resulting in a biomimetic nanomedicine (CM&#8208;BSPO). CM&#8208;BSPO shows highly efficient tumor targeting and cellular internalization properties. The engulfment of CM&#8208;BSPO accompanied with laser irradiation results in a prominent antitumor effect, evidenced by disruption of cell cycles in tumor cells, increased apoptosis and DNA damage, and subsequent inhibition of repair for damaged DNA. The mechanism for the synergistic effect from PDT and olaparib is unveiled at the genetic and protein level through transcriptome analysis. Overall, this biodegradable and branched glycopolymer&#8211;drug conjugate could be effectively optimized as a biomimetic nanomedicine for cancer therapy.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed High&#8208;Density Al&#8211;N4 Sites in Porous Carbon for Efficient Photodriven CO2 Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous carbon possessing atomically dispersed Al&#8211;N4 motifs exhibits excellent catalytic performance for photothermal CO2 cycloaddition reaction by taking advantage of the uniformly dispersed Al/N species and the efficient photothermal effect of the carbon matrix. Importantly, the photogenerated electrons favor transfer from Al&#8211;N&#8211;C to epoxide and significantly accelerate the rate&#8208;limiting step, which opens a new activation mechanism for CO2 cycloaddition reaction.








Abstract
Highly active catalysts that can directly utilize renewable energy (e.g., solar energy) are desirable for CO2 value&#8208;added processes. Herein, aiming at improving the efficiency of photodriven CO2 cycloaddition reactions, a catalyst composed of porous carbon nanosheets enriched with a high loading of atomically dispersed Al atoms (&#8776;14.4&#160;wt%, corresponding to an atomic percent of &#8776;7.3%) coordinated with N (AlN4 motif, Al&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst) via a versatile molecule&#8208;confined pyrolysis strategy is reported. The performance of the Al&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst for catalytic CO2 cycloaddition under light irradiation (&#8776;95% conversion, reaction rate = 3.52 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) is significantly superior to that obtained under a thermal environment (&#8776;57% conversion, reaction rate = 2.11 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). Besides the efficient photothermal conversion induced by the carbon matrix, both experimental and theoretical analysis reveal that light irradiation favors the photogenerated electron transfer from the semiconductive Al&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst to the epoxide reactant, facilitating the formation of a ring&#8208;opened intermediate through the rate&#8208;limiting step. This study not only provides an advanced Al&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst for photodriven CO2 cycloaddition, but also furnishes new insight for the rational design of superior photocatalysts for diverse heterogeneous catalytic reactions in the future.

         <title>Highly Selective Adsorption of Carbon Dioxide over Acetylene in an Ultramicroporous Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Partially desolvated Cu&#8208;F&#8208;pymo can exclusively capture CO2 over C2H2 with very high selectivity. Sorption experiments and modeling studies reveal that such a molecular sieving effect is attributed to the suppression of C2H2 adsorption by residual water molecules. The inverse separation is further confirmed by column breakthrough studies given that highly pure acetylene (&gt;99.9%) can be directly harvested.








Abstract
Separating carbon dioxide from fuel gases like hydrocarbons by physical adsorbents is industrially important and more energy&#8208;efficient than traditional liquid extraction or cryogenic distillation methods. It is very important while very challenging to develop CO2&#8208;selective adsorbents, considering CO2 is less polarizable than light hydrocarbon molecules, particularly those simultaneously with almost identical molecular dimensions and physical properties, such as acetylene. Herein, an ultramicroporous metal&#8211;organic framework constructed from copper(II) and 5&#8208;fluoropyrimidin&#8208;2&#8208;olate, termed Cu&#8208;F&#8208;pymo, is carefully studied under different activations for inverse separation of CO2 from C2H2. The partially desolvated Cu&#8208;F&#8208;pymo can exclusively capture CO2 over C2H2 with very high selectivity exceeding 105 under ambient conditions, the highest ever reported. Sorption experiments and modeling studies reveal that such molecular sieving effect is attributed to the suppression of C2H2 adsorption from the blockage of the preferential sites for C2H2 by residual water molecules. The inverse separation is further confirmed by column breakthrough studies given that highly pure acetylene (&gt;99.9%) can be directly harvested from the gas mixture. Cu&#8208;F&#8208;pymo also shows remarkable stability under harsh conditions.

         <title>Rational Design and General Synthesis of Multimetallic Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nano&#8208;Octahedra for Enhanced Li&#8211;S Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of Mn&#8208;based multimetallic metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nano&#8208;octahedra are prepared. The synthetic strategy is utilized to incorporate metal ions into the MOF architecture, of which the parent monometallic MOF nano&#8208;octahedra could not be prepared directly, thus rationally generating novel multimetallic MOFs, which also allows for the general synthesis of various micro&#8208;/nanoscale MOFs in the energy storage field.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), which consist of central metal nodes and organic linkers, constitute a fast growing class of crystalline porous materials with excellent application potential. Herein, a series of Mn&#8208;based multimetallic MOF (bimetallic and trimetallic MIL&#8208;100) nano&#8208;octahedra are prepared by a facile one&#8208;pot synthetic strategy. The types and proportions of the incorporated elements can be tuned while retaining the original topological structure. The introduction of other metal ions is verified at the atomic level by combining X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure experiments and theoretical calculations. Furthermore, these multimetallic Mn&#8208;based MIL&#8208;100 nano&#8208;octahedra are utilized as sulfur hosts to prepare cathodes for Li&#8211;S batteries. The MnNi&#8208;MIL&#8208;100@S cathode exhibits the best Li&#8211;S battery performance among all reported MIL&#8208;100@S composite cathode materials, with a reversible capacity of &#8776;708.8 mAh g&#8722;1 after 200 cycles. The synthetic strategy described herein is utilized to incorporate metal ions into the MOF architecture, of which the parent monometallic MOF nano&#8208;octahedra cannot be prepared directly, thus rationally generating novel multimetallic MOFs. Importantly, the strategy also allows for the general synthesis and study of various micro&#8208;/nanoscale MOFs in the energy storage field.

The synthetic strategy is utilized to incorporate metal ions into the MOF architecture, of which the parent monometallic MOF nano-octahedra could not be prepared directly, thus rationally generating novel multimetallic MOFs, which also allows for the general synthesis of various micro-/nanoscale MOFs in the energy storage field.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), which consist of central metal nodes and organic linkers, constitute a fast growing class of crystalline porous materials with excellent application potential. Herein, a series of Mn-based multimetallic MOF (bimetallic and trimetallic MIL-100) nano-octahedra are prepared by a facile one-pot synthetic strategy. The types and proportions of the incorporated elements can be tuned while retaining the original topological structure. The introduction of other metal ions is verified at the atomic level by combining X-ray absorption fine structure experiments and theoretical calculations. Furthermore, these multimetallic Mn-based MIL-100 nano-octahedra are utilized as sulfur hosts to prepare cathodes for Li&#8211;S batteries. The MnNi-MIL-100@S cathode exhibits the best Li&#8211;S battery performance among all reported MIL-100@S composite cathode materials, with a reversible capacity of &#8776;708.8 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 200 cycles. The synthetic strategy described herein is utilized to incorporate metal ions into the MOF architecture, of which the parent monometallic MOF nano-octahedra cannot be prepared directly, thus rationally generating novel multimetallic MOFs. Importantly, the strategy also allows for the general synthesis and study of various micro-/nanoscale MOFs in the energy storage field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>3D Printing of Superhydrophobic Objects with Bulk Nanostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The principle of polymerization&#8208;induced phase separation is exploited to 3D print superhydrophobic objects with bulk nanostructure and unlimited geometrical freedom. The bulk nanoporous structure of the 3D&#8208;printed superhydrophobic objects not only makes them tolerant to abrasion damage, but also opens new possibilities in applications including gas&#8208;permeable and water&#8208;repellent microfluidics, as well as hierarchically structured super oil absorbents.








Abstract
The rapid development of 3D printing (or additive manufacturing) technologies demands new materials with novel properties and functionalities. Superhydrophobic materials, owing to their ultralow water adhesion, self&#8208;cleaning, anti&#8208;biofouling, or superoleophilic properties are useful for myriad applications involving liquids. However, the majority of the methods for making superhydrophobic surfaces have been based on surface functionalization and coatings, which are challenging to apply to 3D objects. Additionally, these coatings are vulnerable to abrasion due to low mechanical stability and limited thickness. Here, a new materials concept and methodology for 3D printing of superhydrophobic macroscopic objects with bulk nanostructure and almost unlimited geometrical freedom is presented. The method is based on a specific ink composed of hydrophobic (meth)acrylate monomers and porogen solvents, which undergoes phase separation upon photopolymerization to generate inherently nanoporous and superhydrophobic structures. Using a desktop Digital Light Processing printer, superhydrophobic 3D objects with complex shapes are demonstrated, with ultralow and uniform water adhesion measured with scanning droplet adhesion microscopy. It is shown that the 3D&#8208;printed objects, owing to their nanoporous structure throughout the entire volume, preserve their superhydrophobicity upon wear damage. Finally, a superhydrophobic 3D&#8208;printed gas&#8208;permeable and water&#8208;repellent microfluidic device and a hierarchically structured 3D&#8208;printed super&#8208;oil&#8208;absorbent are demonstrated.

         <title>High Energy Density Solid State Lithium Metal Batteries Enabled by Sub&#8208;5 &#181;m Solid Polymer Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thin, solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) are crucial to improve cell energy density. However, limited oxide stability and weak strength hinder the application of ultrathin SSEs. In this work, an ultrathin bilayer SSE with porous ceramic scaffold inside is proposed to simultaneously enlarge the electrochemical window and improve the mechanical strength. High&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;metal batteries are also demonstrated.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs) are considered as the most promising next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density energy storage devices due to their ability in addressing the safety concerns from organic electrolytes and enabling energy dense lithium anodes. To ensure the high energy density of SSBs, solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) are required to be thin and light&#8208;weight, and simultaneously offer a wide electrochemical window to pair with high&#8208;voltage cathodes. However, the decrease of SSE thickness and delicate structure may increase the cell safety risks, which is detrimental for the practical application of SSBs. Herein, to demonstrate a high&#8208;energy&#8208;density SSB with sufficient safety insurance, an ultrathin (4.2 &#181;m) bilayer SSE with porous ceramic scaffold and double&#8208;layer Li+&#8208;conducting polymer, is proposed. The fire&#8208;resistant and stiff ceramic scaffold improves the safety capability and mechanical strength of the composite SSE, and the bilayer polymer structure enhances the compatibility of Li metal anode and high&#8208;voltage cathodes. The 3D ceramic facilitates Li&#8208;ion conduction and regulates Li deposition. Thus, high energy density of 506&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and 1514&#160;Wh L&#8722;1 is achieved based on LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) cathodes with a low N/P ratio and long lifespan over 3000 h. High&#8208;energy&#8208;density anode&#8208;free cells are further demonstrated.

         <title>Heterogeneous Functional Dielectric Patterns for Charge&#8208;Carrier Modulation in Ultraflexible Organic Integrated Circuits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modulating the behavior of charge carriers in respective transistors on the same substrate is essential in maximizing the performance of organic integrated circuits (ICs). Heterogeneous functional dielectric patterns for charge&#8208;carrier modulation are obtained by UV patterning. Consequently, the threshold voltage is precisely controlled within the 2&#8211;4&#160;V operational range. Furthermore, these ultraflexible organic ICs exhibit the highest performance.








Abstract
Flexible electronics have gained considerable attention for application in wearable devices. Organic transistors are potential candidates to develop flexible integrated circuits (ICs). A primary technique for maximizing their reliability, gain, and operation speed is the modulation of charge&#8208;carrier behavior in the respective transistors fabricated on the same substrate. In this work, heterogeneous functional dielectric patterns (HFDP) of ultrathin polymer gate dielectrics of poly((&#177;)endo,exo&#8208;bicyclo[2.2.1]hept&#8208;ene&#8208;2,3&#8208;dicarboxylic acid, diphenylester) (PNDPE) are introduced. The HFDP that are obtained via the photo&#8208;Fries rearrangement by ultraviolet radiation in the homogeneous PNDPE provide a functional area for charge&#8208;carrier modulation. This leads to programmable threshold voltage control over a wide range (&#8722;1.5 to +0.2&#160;V) in the transistors with a high patterning resolution, at 2&#160;V operational voltage. The transistors also exhibit high operational stability over 140 days and under the bias&#8208;stress duration of 1800&#160;s. With the HFDP, the performance metrics of ICs, for example, the noise margin and gain of the zero&#8208;VGS load inverters and the oscillation frequency of ring oscillators are improved to 80%, 1200, and 2.5&#160;kHz, respectively, which are the highest among the previously reported zero&#8208;VGS&#8208;based organic circuits. The HFDP can be applied to much complex and ultraflexible ICs.

A large&#8208;area optoelectronic neuromorphic system demonstrates the hardware training of random images using multispectral light signals. It provides the first demonstration of a monolithically integrated and scalable optoelectronic neuromorphic devices composed of a heterostructure phototransistor and circuit component with standard complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) processing, which is capable of efficient pattern recognition by the fully optically derived signals.








Abstract
The complete hardware implementation of an optoelectronic neuromorphic computing system is considered as one of the most promising solutions to realize energy&#8208;efficient artificial intelligence. Here, a fully light&#8208;driven and scalable optoelectronic neuromorphic circuit with metal&#8208;chalcogenide/metal&#8208;oxide heterostructure phototransistor and photovoltaic divider is proposed. To achieve wavelength&#8208;selective neural operation and hardware&#8208;based pattern recognition, multispectral light modulated bidirectional synaptic circuits are utilized as an individual pixel for highly accurate and large&#8208;area neuromorphic computing system. The wavelength selective control of photo&#8208;generated charges at the heterostructure interface enables the bidirectional synaptic modulation behaviors including the excitatory and inhibitory modulations. More importantly, a 7 &#215; 7 neuromorphic pixel circuit array is demonstrated to show the viability of implementing highly accurate hardware&#8208;based pattern training. In both the pixel training and pattern recognition simulation, the neuromorphic circuit array with the bidirectional synaptic modulation exhibits lower training errors and higher recognition rates, respectively.

         <title>Sono&#8208;Controllable and ROS&#8208;Sensitive CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 Genome Editing for Augmented/Synergistic Ultrasound Tumor Nanotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel avenue to circumvent the resistance of tumor cells in conventional sonodynamic therapy is pioneered in this work, where targeted delivery and controllable release of the cluster regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat&#8208;associated protein system is also achieved.








Abstract
The potential of the cluster regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)&#8208;associated protein 9 (Cas9)&#8208;based therapeutic genome editing is severely hampered by the difficulties in precise regulation of the in vivo activity of the CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 system. Herein, sono&#8208;controllable and reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;sensitive sonosensitizer&#8208;integrated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), denoted as P/M@CasMTH1, are developed for augmented sonodynamic therapy (SDT) efficacy using the genome&#8208;editing technology. P/M@CasMTH1 nanoparticles comprise singlet oxygen (1O2)&#8208;generating MOF structures anchored with CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 systems via 1O2&#8208;cleavable linkers, which serve not only as a delivery vector of CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 targeting MTH1, but also as a sonoregulator to spatiotemporally activate the genome editing. P/M@CasMTH1 escapes from the lysosomes, harvests the ultrasound (US) energy and converts it into abundant 1O2 to induce SDT. The generated ROS subsequently trigger cleavage of ROS&#8208;responsive thioether bonds, thus inducing controllable release of the CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 system and initiation of genome editing. The genomic disruption of MTH1 conspicuously augments the therapeutic efficacy of SDT by destroying the self&#8208;defense system in tumor cells, thereby causing cellular apoptosis and tumor suppression. This therapeutic strategy for synergistic MTH1 disruption and abundant 1O2 generation provides a paradigm for augmenting SDT efficacy based on the emerging nanomedicine&#8208;enabled genome&#8208;editing technology.

         <title>Ubiquitination Flow Repressors: Enhancing Wound Healing of Infectious Diabetic Ulcers through Stabilization of Polyubiquitinated Hypoxia&#8208;Inducible Factor&#8208;1&#945; by Theranostic Nitric Oxide Nanogenerators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A subcutaneous injectable near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;triggered theranostic nitric oxide nanogenerator is bioengineered to maintain hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor&#8208;1&#945; (HIF&#8208;1&#945;) stability by repressing ubiquitination&#8208;mediated protein degradation and promote diabetic ulcer healing. This nanogenerator is also capable of early detection and elimination of wound infections.








Abstract
Current treatments for diabetic ulcers (DUs) remain unsatisfactory due to the risk of bacterial infection and impaired angiogenesis during the healing process. The increased degradation of polyubiquitinated hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor&#8208;1&#945; (HIF&#8208;1&#945;) compromises wound healing efficacy. Therefore, the maintenance of HIF&#8208;1&#945; protein stability might help treat DU. Nitric oxide (NO) is an intrinsic biological messenger that functions as a ubiquitination flow repressor and antibacterial agent; however, its clinical application in DU treatment is hindered by the difficulty in controlling NO release. Here, an intelligent near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;triggered NO nanogenerator (SNP@MOF&#8208;UCNP@ssPDA&#8208;Cy7/IR786s, abbreviated as SNP@UCM) is presented. SNP@UCM represses ubiquitination&#8208;mediated proteasomal degradation of HIF&#8208;1&#945; by inhibiting its interaction with E3 ubiquitin ligases under NIR irradiation. Increased HIF&#8208;1&#945; expression in endothelial cells by SNP@UCM enhances angiogenesis in wound sites, promoting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion and cell proliferation and migration. SNP@UCM also enables early detection of wound infections and ROS&#8208;mediated killing of bacteria. The potential clinical utility of SNP@UCM is further demonstrated in infected full&#8208;thickness DU model under NIR irradiation. SNP@UCM is the first reported HIF&#8208;1&#945;&#8208;stabilizing advanced nanomaterial, and further materials engineering might offer a facile, mechanism&#8208;based method for clinical DU management.

         <title>Self&#8208;Powered Interactive Fiber Electronics with Visual&#8211;Digital Synergies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bimodal fiber electronics that can simultaneously visualize and digitize mechanical stimulus without an external power supply is presented. The novel visual&#8211;digital synergies mechanism endows the fiber electronics with excellent optical and electrical performance, and new temporal&#8211;spatial resolution. Industrial&#8208;level scalable manufacture and recycling are thoroughly demonstrated. This bimodal fiber electronics shows unique application in human&#8211;machine interfaces and underwater sensing.








Abstract
Fiber electronics with mechanosensory functionality are highly desirable in healthcare, human&#8211;machine interfaces, and robotics. Most efforts are committed to optimize the electronically readable interface of fiber mechanoreceptor, while the user interface based on naked&#8208;eye readable output is rarely explored. Here, a scalable fiber electronics that can simultaneously visualize and digitize the mechanical stimulus without external power supply, named self&#8208;powered optoelectronic synergistic fiber sensors (SOEFSs), are reported. By coupling of space and surface charge polarization, a new mechanoluminescent (ML)&#8208;triboelectric synergistic effect is realized. It contributes to remarkable enhancement of both electrical (by 100%) and optical output (by 30%), as well as novel temporal&#8211;spatial resolution mode for motion capturing. Based on entirely new thermoplastic ML material system and spinning process, industrial&#8208;level continuously manufacture and recycling processes of SOEFS are realized. Furthermore, SOEFSs&#8217; application in human&#8211;machine interface, virtual reality, and underwater sensing, rescue, and information interaction is demonstrated.

         <title>Nickelate Superconductivity without Rare&#8208;Earth Magnetism: (La,Sr)NiO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
By refining the synthesis of high&#8208;quality thin films, a superconducting dome is observed in La1&#8722;xSrxNiO2. Perhaps more surprisingly, undoped LaNiO2 also shows a strong indication of superconductivity. A generalized superconducting dome can be obtained by combining the La/Pr/Nd systems, revealing systematic shifts in the unit cell volume and the relative electron&#8211;hole population across the lanthanides.








Abstract
The occurrence of unconventional superconductivity in cuprates has long motivated the search for manifestations in other layered transition metal oxides. Recently, superconductivity is found in infinite&#8208;layer nickelate (Nd,Sr)NiO2 and (Pr,Sr)NiO2 thin films, formed by topotactic reduction from the perovskite precursor phase. A topic of much current interest is whether rare&#8208;earth moments are essential for superconductivity in this system. In this study, it is found that with significant materials optimization, substantial portions of the La1&#8722;xSrxNiO2 phase diagram can enter the regime of coherent low&#8208;temperature transport (x&#160;= 0.14 &#8208; 0.20), with subsequent superconducting transitions and a maximum onset of &#8776;9 K at x&#160;= 0.20. Additionally, the unexpected indication of a superconducting ground state in undoped LaNiO2 is observed, which likely reflects the self&#8208;doped nature of the electronic structure. Combining the results of (La/Pr/Nd)1&#8722;xSrxNiO2 reveals a generalized superconducting dome, characterized by systematic shifts in the unit cell volume and in the relative electron&#8208;hole populations across the lanthanides.

2D amorphous MoS3&#8208;on&#8208;rGO heterostructure is constructed via an isotropic growth process for beyond&#8208;lithium&#8208;ion batteries (Na+, K+, and Zn2+) with outstanding electrochemical performance and superior cyclic stability. The amorphous MoS3&#8208;on&#8208;rGO exhibits low strain and fast reaction kinetics during cycling.








Abstract
Beyond&#8208;lithium&#8208;ion storage devices are promising alternatives to lithium&#8208;ion storage devices for low&#8208;cost and large&#8208;scale applications. Nowadays, the most of high&#8208;capacity electrodes are crystal materials. However, these crystal materials with intrinsic anisotropy feature generally suffer from lattice strain and structure pulverization during the electrochemical process. Herein, a 2D heterostructure of amorphous molybdenum sulfide (MoS3) on reduced graphene surface (denoted as MoS3&#8208;on&#8208;rGO), which exhibits low strain and fast reaction kinetics for beyond&#8208;lithium&#8208;ions (Na+, K+, Zn2+) storage is demonstrated. Benefiting from the low volume expansion and small sodiation strain of the MoS3&#8208;on&#8208;rGO, it displays ultralong cycling performance of 40&#8201;000&#160;cycles at 10&#160;A g&#8722;1 for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. Furthermore, the as&#8208;constructed 2D heterostructure also delivers superior electrochemical performance when used in Na+ full batteries, solid&#8208;state sodium batteries, K+ batteries, Zn2+ batteries and hybrid supercapacitors, demonstrating its excellent application prospect.

         <title>Polydopamine Nanobottles with Photothermal Capability for Controlled Release and Related Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polydopamine nanobottles with strong optical absorption are fabricated and then explored as a versatile platform for the encapsulation and controlled release of various types of cargos, including small molecules and biomacromolecules.








Abstract
Nanobottles refer to colloidal particles featuring a hollow body connected to a single opening on the surface. This unique feature makes them ideal carriers for the encapsulation and controlled release of various types of cargos. Here a facile route to the fabrication of uniform nanobottles made of polydopamine by leveraging swelling&#8208;induced pressure is reported. When polystyrene spheres are coated with polydopamine and then incubated with a toluene/water emulsion, the polystyrene will be swollen to automatically poke a single hole in the shell because of the pressure inside the shell. After quenching the swelling with ethanol and then removing all the polystyrene with tetrahydrofuran, polydopamine nanobottles are obtained. The dimensions of the hollow body are determined by the polystyrene template, while the size of the opening can be tuned by varying the shell thickness. Through the opening, different types of cargos, including small molecules and biomacromolecules, can be easily loaded with a thermoresponsive material into the cavity. The cargos can be released in a controllable manner through direct heating or polydopamine&#8208;enabled photothermal heating. In a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiment, the polydopamine nanobottles are used for temperature&#8208;controlled release of thrombin to trigger the formation of fibrin gels in situ.

         <title>Codes in Code: AIE Supramolecular Adhesive Hydrogels Store Huge Amounts of Information</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction of AIE supramolecular adhesive hydrogels showing different fluorescent colors and the use of a &#8220;Codes in Code&#8221; method, incorporating 1D barcode or/and 2D code patterns into a 3D code pattern, to demonstrate the storage capacity of large amounts of information, are reported. This study realizes a great improvement of the storage capacity of information code materials.








Abstract
With the continuous advancement of information technology, the requirements for the information storage capacity of materials are getting higher and higher. However, information code materials usually only store a single piece of information. In order to improve their storage capacity, aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) supramolecular adhesive hydrogels with different fluorescent colors are prepared, and a &#8220;Codes in Code&#8221; method is used to demonstrate the storage capacity for large amounts of information. Four kinds of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) supramolecular hydrogels with different fluorescent colors are prepared; based on the hydrogen bonds on the hydrogel surface, these hydrogels can be assembled into a hydrogel, G5, which shows multiple fluorescent colors under the irradiation of UV light. When many 1D barcode patterns or/and 2D code patterns are incorporated into G5, not only a kind of 3D information but also plenty of 1D or/and 2D information can be stored. Therefore, the information codes prepared by the &#8220;Codes in Code&#8221; method can store a large amount of information.

         <title>Electrical Generation and Deletion of Magnetic Skyrmion&#8208;Bubbles via Vertical Current Injection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new route to generate and delete magnetic skyrmion&#8208;bubbles electrically is presented using a vertical current path. The vertical current path concept is easy to integrate with a widely used spin&#8211;orbit torque device. Using the vertical current path with a spin&#8211;orbit&#8208;torque device, core operations for a skyrmion racetrack memory device in a three&#8208;terminal device are demonstrated.








Abstract
The magnetic skyrmion is a topologically protected spin texture that has attracted much attention as a promising information carrier because of its distinct features of suitability for high&#8208;density storage, low power consumption, and stability. One of the skyrmion devices proposed so far is the skyrmion racetrack memory, which is the skyrmion version of the domain&#8208;wall racetrack memory. For application in devices, skyrmion racetrack memory requires electrical generation, deletion, and displacement of isolated skyrmions. Despite the progress in experimental demonstrations of skyrmion generation, deletion, and displacement, these three operations have yet to be realized in one device. Here, a route for generating and deleting isolated skyrmion&#8208;bubbles through vertical current injection with an explanation of its microscopic origin is presented. By combining the proposed skyrmion&#8208;bubble generation/deletion method with the spin&#8211;orbit&#8208;torque&#8208;driven skyrmion shift, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experimental demonstration of the skyrmion racetrack memory operation in a three&#8208;terminal device structure is provided.

         <title>Impact of Nanoscale Morphology on Charge Carrier Delocalization and Mobility in an Organic Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hole carrier wavefunction is propagated through samples of pentacene with varying levels of structural disorder using surface hopping non&#8208;adiabatic molecular dynamics. It is found that charge carriers are more delocalized, that is, more &#8220;quantum&#8221; than previously thought, even for relatively disordered samples, and the mechanism of charge transport as a function of crystallinity is established.








Abstract
A central challenge of organic semiconductor research is to make cheap, disordered materials that exhibit high electrical conductivity. Unfortunately, this endeavor is hampered by the poor fundamental understanding of the relationship between molecular packing structure and charge carrier mobility. Here a novel computational methodology is presented that fills this gap. Using a melt&#8208;quench procedure it is shown that amorphous pentacene spontaneously self&#8208;assembles to nanocrystalline structures that, at long quench times, form the characteristic herringbone layer of the single crystal. Quantum dynamical simulations of electron hole transport show a clear correlation between the crystallinity of the sample, the quantum delocalization, and the mobility of the charge carrier. Surprisingly, the long&#8208;held belief that charge carriers form relatively localized polarons in disordered OS is only valid for fully amorphous structures&#8212;for nanocrystalline and crystalline samples, significant charge carrier delocalization over several nanometers occurs that underpins their improved conductivities. The good agreement with experimentally available data makes the presented methodology a robust computational tool for the predictive engineering of disordered organic materials.

It is found that charge carriers are more delocalized, that is, more &#8220;quantum&#8221; than previously thought, even for relatively disordered samples, and the mechanism of charge transport as a function of crystallinity is established.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A central challenge of organic semiconductor research is to make cheap, disordered materials that exhibit high electrical conductivity. Unfortunately, this endeavor is hampered by the poor fundamental understanding of the relationship between molecular packing structure and charge carrier mobility. Here a novel computational methodology is presented that fills this gap. Using a melt-quench procedure it is shown that amorphous pentacene spontaneously self-assembles to nanocrystalline structures that, at long quench times, form the characteristic herringbone layer of the single crystal. Quantum dynamical simulations of electron hole transport show a clear correlation between the crystallinity of the sample, the quantum delocalization, and the mobility of the charge carrier. Surprisingly, the long-held belief that charge carriers form relatively localized polarons in disordered OS is only valid for fully amorphous structures&#8212;for nanocrystalline and crystalline samples, significant charge carrier delocalization over several nanometers occurs that underpins their improved conductivities. The good agreement with experimentally available data makes the presented methodology a robust computational tool for the predictive engineering of disordered organic materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient and Spectrally Stable Blue Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Employing a Cationic &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorene&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;conjugated cationic polymer as a multifunctional passivator to suppress non&#8208;radiative processes, improve charge transport properties, and inhibit ion migration for blue mixed&#8208;halide perovskite semiconductors, is reported. As a result, efficient and spectrally stable blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes with emission wavelengths from 485 to 458 nm are achieved.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskite semiconductors have demonstrated remarkable potentials in solution&#8208;processed blue light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). However, the unsatisfied efficiency and spectral stability responsible for trap&#8208;mediated non&#8208;radiative losses and halide phase segregation remain the primary unsolved challenges for blue perovskite LEDs. In this study, it is reported that a fluorene&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;conjugated cationic polymer can be blended with the perovskite semiconductor to control film formation and optoelectronic properties. As a result, sky&#8208;blue and true&#8208;blue perovskite LEDs with Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage coordinates of (0.08, 0.22) and (0.12, 0.13) at the record external quantum efficiencies of 11.2% and 8.0% were&#160;achieved. In addition, the mixed halide perovskites with the conjugated cationic polymer exhibit excellent spectral stability under external bias. This result illustrates that &#960;&#8208;conjugated cationic polymers have a great potential to realize efficient blue mixed&#8208;halide perovskite LEDs with stable electroluminescence.

         <title>A Liquid Metal Mediated Metallic Coating for Antimicrobial and Antiviral Fabrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple method to coat metallic particles on fibers is reported. Liquid metal (LM), gallium particles serve as an adhesive nucleation layer to reduce copper ions into metallic copper via galvanic replacement. The liquid&#8208;metal&#8211;copper (LMCu) particles have excellent antimicrobial and antiviral activity against a wide range of bacteria, fungi, and influenza and corona viruses.








Abstract
Fabrics are widely used in hospitals and many other settings for bedding, clothing, and face masks; however, microbial pathogens can survive on surfaces for a long time, leading to microbial transmission. Coatings of metallic particles on fabrics have been widely used to eradicate pathogens. However, current metal particle coating technologies encounter numerous issues such as nonuniformity, processing complexity, and poor adhesion. To overcome these issues, an easy&#8208;to&#8208;control and straightforward method is reported to coat a wide range of fabrics by using gallium liquid metal (LM) particles to facilitate the deposition of liquid metal copper alloy (LMCu) particles. Gallium particles coated on the fabric provide nucleation sites for forming LMCu particles at room temperature via galvanic replacement of Cu2+ ions. The LM helps promote strong adhesion of the particles to the fabric. The presence of the LMCu particles can eradicate over 99% of pathogens (including bacteria, fungi, and viruses) within 5&#160;min, which is significantly more effective than control samples coated with only Cu. The coating remains effective over multiple usages and against contaminated droplets and aerosols, such as those encountered in facemasks. This facile coating method is promising for generating robust antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral fabrics and surfaces.

         <title>Electro&#8208;Optic Activity in Excess of 1000 pm V&#8722;1 Achieved via Theory&#8208;Guided Organic Chromophore Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using theory&#8208;guided design, a new series of organic electro&#8208;optic chromophores is demonstrated, based on strong bis(4&#8208;dialkylaminophenyl)phenylamino electron&#8208;donating groups. Density functional theory modeling and hyper&#8208;Rayleigh scattering measurements confirm large improvements in hyperpolarizability. The best electro&#8208;optic coefficient (r33&#160;= 1100&#160;&#177; 100 pm V&#8722;1) is nearly twice as high as the previous best example and higher than for thin&#8208;film barium titanate.








Abstract
High performance organic electro&#8208;optic (OEO) materials enable ultrahigh bandwidth, small footprint, and extremely low drive voltage in silicon&#8208;organic hybrid and plasmonic&#8208;organic hybrid photonic devices. However, practical OEO materials under device&#8208;relevant conditions are generally limited to performance of &#8776;300 pm V&#8722;1 (10&#215; the EO response of lithium niobate). By means of theory&#8208;guided design, a new series of OEO chromophores is demonstrated, based on strong bis(4&#8208;dialkylaminophenyl)phenylamino electron donating groups, capable of EO coefficients (r33) in excess of 1000 pm V&#8722;1. Density functional theory modeling and hyper&#8208;Rayleigh scattering measurements are performed and confirm the large improvement in hyperpolarizability due to the stronger donor. The EO performance of the exemplar chromophore in the series, BAY1, is evaluated neat and at various concentrations in polymer host and shows a nearly linear increase in r33 and poling efficiency (r33/Ep, Ep is poling field) with increasing chromophore concentration. 25 wt% BAY1/polymer composite shows a higher poling efficiency (3.9&#160;&#177; 0.1 nm2 V&#8722;2) than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art neat chromophores. Using a high&#8208;&#949; charge blocking layer with BAY1, a record&#8208;high r33 (1100&#160;&#177; 100 pm V&#8722;1) and poling efficiency (17.8&#160;&#177; 0.8&#160;nm2 V&#8722;2) at 1310&#160;nm are achieved. This is the first reported OEO material with electro&#8208;optic response larger than thin&#8208;film barium titanate.

         <title>Calcium Phosphate&#8208;Reinforced Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Regulate Adenosine&#8208;Mediated Immunosuppression</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calcium&#8208;phosphate&#8208;reinforced iron&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (CaP@Fe&#8208;MOFs) are designed to reduce adenosine accumulation and to inhibit adenosine&#8208;mediated immunosuppressive response. CaP@Fe&#8208;MOFs regulate the adenosine metabolism by promoting adenosine&#8208;kinase&#8208;mediated phosphorylation and relieving the hypoxic tumor microenvironment. Moreover, CaP@Fe&#8208;MOFs enhance the antitumor immune response via adenosine regulation, including the increase of T lymphocytes and dendritic cells and the decrease of regulatory T lymphocytes.








Abstract
Long&#8208;term accumulation of adenosine (Ado) in tumor tissues helps to establish the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and to promote tumor development. Regulation of Ado metabolism is particularly pivotal for blocking Ado&#8208;mediated immunosuppression. The activity of adenosine kinase (ADK) for catalyzing the phosphorylation of Ado plays an essential role in regulating Ado metabolism. Specifically, accumulated Ado in the tumor microenvironment occupies the active site of ADK, inhibiting the phosphorylation of Ado. Phosphate can protect ADK from inactivation and restore the activity of ADK. Herein, calcium phosphate&#8208;reinforced iron&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (CaP@Fe&#8208;MOFs) are designed to reduce Ado accumulation and to inhibit Ado&#8208;mediated immunosuppressive response in the tumor microenvironment. CaP@Fe&#8208;MOFs are found to regulate the Ado metabolism by promoting ADK&#8208;mediated phosphorylation and relieving the hypoxic tumor microenvironment. Moreover, CaP@Fe&#8208;MOFs can enhance the antitumor immune response via Ado regulation, including the increase of T lymphocytes and dendritic cells and the decrease of regulatory T lymphocytes. Finally, CaP@Fe&#8208;MOFs are used for cancer treatment in mice, alleviating the Ado&#8208;mediated immunosuppressive response and achieving tumor suppression. This study may offer a general strategy for blocking the Ado&#8208;mediated immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment and further for enhancing the immunotherapy efficacy in vivo.

&lt;p&gt;Calcium-phosphate-reinforced iron-based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (CaP@Fe-MOFs) are designed to reduce adenosine accumulation and to inhibit adenosine-mediated immunosuppressive response. CaP@Fe-MOFs regulate the adenosine metabolism by promoting adenosine-kinase-mediated phosphorylation and relieving the hypoxic tumor microenvironment. Moreover, CaP@Fe-MOFs enhance the antitumor immune response via adenosine regulation, including the increase of T lymphocytes and dendritic cells and the decrease of regulatory T lymphocytes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long-term accumulation of adenosine (Ado) in tumor tissues helps to establish the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and to promote tumor development. Regulation of Ado metabolism is particularly pivotal for blocking Ado-mediated immunosuppression. The activity of adenosine kinase (ADK) for catalyzing the phosphorylation of Ado plays an essential role in regulating Ado metabolism. Specifically, accumulated Ado in the tumor microenvironment occupies the active site of ADK, inhibiting the phosphorylation of Ado. Phosphate can protect ADK from inactivation and restore the activity of ADK. Herein, calcium phosphate-reinforced iron-based metal-organic frameworks (CaP@Fe-MOFs) are designed to reduce Ado accumulation and to inhibit Ado-mediated immunosuppressive response in the tumor microenvironment. CaP@Fe-MOFs are found to regulate the Ado metabolism by promoting ADK-mediated phosphorylation and relieving the hypoxic tumor microenvironment. Moreover, CaP@Fe-MOFs can enhance the antitumor immune response via Ado regulation, including the increase of T lymphocytes and dendritic cells and the decrease of regulatory T lymphocytes. Finally, CaP@Fe-MOFs are used for cancer treatment in mice, alleviating the Ado-mediated immunosuppressive response and achieving tumor suppression. This study may offer a general strategy for blocking the Ado-mediated immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment and further for enhancing the immunotherapy efficacy in vivo.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Large&#8208;Area Epitaxial Film Growth of van der Waals Ferromagnetic Ternary Chalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D magnetic crystals constitute ideal platforms to experimentally access the fundamental physics of magnetism and achieve magneto&#8208;optical and magneto&#8208;electric devices for future electronics. In this work, a new generalized synthetic concept for producing wafer&#8208;scale epitaxial thin films of 2D ferromagnetic ternary chalcogenide crystals is described. The growth process utilizes commercial wafers (Ge, Si) as a metal source as well as epitaxy provider.








Abstract
Following the first experimental realization of intrinsic ferromagnetism in 2D van der Waals (vdW) crystals, several ternary metal chalcogenides with unprecedented long&#8208;range ferromagnetic order have been explored. However, the synthesis of large&#8208;area 2D ternary metal chalcogenide thin films is a great challenge, and a generalized synthesis has not been demonstrated yet. Here, a quick and scalable synthesis of epitaxially aligned ferromagnetic ternary metal chalcogenide thin films (Cr2Ge2Te6, Cr2Si2Te6, Mn3Si2Te6) is reported. The synthesis is based on the flux&#8208;controlled surface diffusion of Te on metal (Cr, Mn)&#8208;deposited wafer (Ge, Si) substrates. Magnetic anisotropy study of the epitaxial ternary thin films reveals the intrinsic magnetic easy axis; out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction for Cr2Ge2Te6 and Cr2Si2Te6, and in&#8208;plane direction for Mn3Si2Te6. In addition to the synthesis, this work creates an opportunity for transfer&#8208;free device fabrication for realizing magnetoelectronics based on the electrical control of both charge and spin degrees of freedom in 2D ferromagnetic semiconductors.

         <title>An Amorphous Peri&#8208;Implant Ligament with Combined Osteointegration and Energy&#8208;Dissipation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired peri&#8208;implant ligament (PIL) is realized using polymer&#8208;infiltrated amorphous titania nanotubes based on a periodontium&#8208;mimetic architecture. The PIL not only provides exceptional osteoinductivity by more than 18% bone&#8211;implant contact, but also remarkably reduces stress transfer to the peri&#8208;implant bone by &#8776;30% as compared to titanium. The PIL will open new possibilities for developing high&#8208;performance implant materials with increased lifespans.








Abstract
Progress toward developing metal implants as permanent hard&#8208;tissue substitutes requires both osteointegration to achieve load&#8208;bearing support, and energy&#8208;dissipation to prevent overload&#8208;induced bone resorption. However, in existing implants these two properties can only be achieved separately. Optimized by natural evolution, tooth&#8208;periodontal&#8208;ligaments with fiber&#8208;bundle structures can efficiently orchestrate load&#8208;bearing and energy dissipation, which make tooth&#8211;bone complexes survive extremely high occlusion loads (&gt;300 N) for prolonged lifetimes. Here, a bioinspired peri&#8208;implant ligament with simultaneously enhanced osteointegration and energy&#8208;dissipation is presented, which is based on the periodontium&#8208;mimetic architecture of a polymer&#8208;infiltrated, amorphous, titania nanotube array. The artificial ligament not only provides exceptional osteoinductivity owing to its nanotopography and beneficial ingredients, but also produces periodontium&#8208;similar energy dissipation due to the complexity of the force transmission modes and interface sliding. The ligament increases bone&#8211;implant contact by more than 18% and simultaneously reduces the effective stress transfer from implant to peri&#8208;implant bone by &#8776;30% as compared to titanium implants, which as far as is known has not previously been achieved. It is anticipated that the concept of an artificial ligament will open new possibilities for developing high&#8208;performance implanted materials with increased lifespans.

         <title>Molecule&#8208;Upgraded van der Waals Contacts for Schottky&#8208;Barrier&#8208;Free Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upgraded van der Waals metal&#8211;semiconductor contacts with near&#8208;zero Schottky barrier are realized by a stable, efficient, and non&#8208;residue molecule treatment of reducing the Schottky barrier width, to enable record&#8208;setting performance metrics of atomically thin transistors.








Abstract
The applications of any ultrathin semiconductor device are inseparable from high&#8208;quality metal&#8211;semiconductor contacts with designed Schottky barriers. Building van der Waals (vdWs) contacts of 2D semiconductors represents an advanced strategy of lowering the Schottky barrier height by reducing interface states, but will finally fail at the theoretical minimum barrier due to the inevitable energy difference between the semiconductor electron affinity and the metal work function. Here, an effective molecule optimization strategy is reported to upgrade the general vdWs contacts, achieving near&#8208;zero Schottky barriers and creating high&#8208;performance electronic devices. The molecule treatment can induce the defect healing effect in p&#8208;type semiconductors and further enhance the hole density, leading to an effectively thinned Schottky barrier width and improved carrier interface transmission efficiency. With an ultrathin Schottky barrier width of &#8776;2.17&#160;nm and outstanding contact resistance of &#8776;9 k&#937;&#160;&#181;m in the optimized Au/WSe2 contacts, an ultrahigh field&#8208;effect mobility of &#8776;148&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 in chemical vapor deposition grown WSe2 flakes is achieved. Unlike conventional chemical treatments, this molecule upgradation strategy leaves no residue and displays a high&#8208;temperature stability at &gt;200 &#176;C. Furthermore, the Schottky barrier optimization is generalized to other metal&#8211;semiconductor contacts, including 1T&#8208;PtSe2/WSe2, 1T&#8242;&#8208;MoTe2/WSe2, 2H&#8208;NbS2/WSe2, and Au/PdSe2, defining a simple, universal, and scalable method to minimize contact resistance.

         <title>AIEgen&#8208;Based Lifetime&#8208;Probes for Precise Furin Quantification and Identification of Cell Subtypes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission luminogen (AIEgen)&#8208;based PyTPA&#8208;ZGO probe with three lifetime signals is proposed for precise furin quantification, including signal 1 of AIEgen (&#964;Pn), signal 2 of inorganic nanoparticles (&#964;Zn), and signal 3 as the composite dual&#8208;lifetime signal (CDLSn). Furthermore, CDLSn exhibits higher accuracy than &#964;Pn and &#964;Zn in identifying cell subtypes based on the specific furin concentration in each subtype.








Abstract
Biochemical sensing probes based on aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission luminogens (AIEgens) are widely used in biological imaging and therapy, chemical sensing, and material sciences. However, it is still a great challenge to quantify the targets through fluorescence intensity of AIEgen probes due to their undesirable aggregations. Here, a PyTPA&#8208;ZGO probe with three lifetime signals for precise quantification of furin is constructed: the lifetime signal 1 and signal 2 comes from AIEgen PyTPA&#8208;P (&#964;Pn) and inorganic nanoparticles Zn2GeO4:Mn2+&#8208;NH2 (&#964;Zn), respectively, while the lifetime signal 3 is marked as the composite dual&#8208;lifetime signal (CDLSn, CDLSn=&#964;Zn&#964;Pn). In contrast, the fluorescence intensity signal of PyTPA&#8208;P shows defectively quantitative performance. Furthermore, it is found that the CDLSn exhibits higher significant differences than the two other lifetime signals (&#964;Pn and &#964;Zn) thanks to its wide range between the maximum and minimum signal values and small standard deviation. Therefore, CDLSn is further used to accurately identify cell subtypes based on the specific concentration of furin in each subtype.

     alt="AIEgen-Based Lifetime-Probes for Precise Furin Quantification and Identification of Cell Subtypes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An aggregation-induced-emission luminogen (AIEgen)-based PyTPA-ZGO probe with three lifetime signals is proposed for precise furin quantification, including signal 1 of AIEgen (&#964;&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;), signal 2 of inorganic nanoparticles (&#964;&lt;sub&gt;Z&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;), and signal 3 as the composite dual-lifetime signal (CDLS&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;). Furthermore, CDLS&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits higher accuracy than &#964;&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; and &#964;&lt;sub&gt;Z&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; in identifying cell subtypes based on the specific furin concentration in each subtype.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biochemical sensing probes based on aggregation-induced-emission luminogens (AIEgens) are widely used in biological imaging and therapy, chemical sensing, and material sciences. However, it is still a great challenge to quantify the targets through fluorescence intensity of AIEgen probes due to their undesirable aggregations. Here, a PyTPA-ZGO probe with three lifetime signals for precise quantification of furin is constructed: the lifetime signal 1 and signal 2 comes from AIEgen PyTPA-P (&#964;&lt;sub&gt;Pn&lt;/sub&gt;) and inorganic nanoparticles Zn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;GeO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;:Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&#964;&lt;sub&gt;Zn&lt;/sub&gt;), respectively, while the lifetime signal 3 is marked as the composite dual-lifetime signal (CDLS&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, CDLSn=&#964;Zn&#964;Pn). In contrast, the fluorescence intensity signal of PyTPA-P shows defectively quantitative performance. Furthermore, it is found that the CDLS&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits higher significant differences than the two other lifetime signals (&#964;&lt;sub&gt;Pn&lt;/sub&gt; and &#964;&lt;sub&gt;Zn&lt;/sub&gt;) thanks to its wide range between the maximum and minimum signal values and small standard deviation. Therefore, CDLS&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is further used to accurately identify cell subtypes based on the specific concentration of furin in each subtype. The lifetime criterion can realize precise quantification, and it should be a promising direction of AIEgen-based quantitative analysis in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tomoscopy: Time&#8208;Resolved Tomography for Dynamic Processes in Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent developments of time&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray tomography, called &#8220;tomoscopy,&#8221; are presented. Tomoscopy provides up to 1000 tomograms per second at &#181;m&#8208;range resolution, running experiments for minutes without interruption. Tomoscopy is applied to study various dynamic processes in materials science.








Abstract
The structure and constitution of opaque materials can be studied with X&#8208;ray imaging methods such as 3D tomography. To observe the dynamic evolution of their structure and the distribution of constituents, for example, during processing, heating, mechanical loading, etc., 3D imaging has to be fast enough. In this paper, the recent developments of time&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray tomography that have led to what one now calls &#8220;tomoscopy&#8221; are briefly reviewed A novel setup is presented and applied that pushes temporal resolution down to just 1&#160;ms, that is, 1000&#160;tomograms per second (tps) are acquired, while maintaining spatial resolutions of micrometers and running experiments for minutes without interruption. Applications recorded at different acquisition rates ranging from 50 to 1000&#160;tps are presented. The authors observe and quantify the immiscible hypermonotectic reaction of AlBi10 (in wt%) alloy and dendrite evolution in AlGe10 (in wt%) casting alloy during fast solidification. The combustion process and the evolution of the constituents are analyzed in a burning sparkler. Finally, the authors follow the structure and density of two metal foams over a long period of time and derive details of bubble formation and bubble ageing including quantitative analyses of bubble parameters with millisecond temporal resolution.

         <title>Cation&#8208;Free siRNA Micelles as Effective Drug Delivery Platform and Potent RNAi Nanomedicines for Glioblastoma Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The siRNA micelle not only acts as a spherical nucleic acid that is able to cross the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) and enter tumor cells, but also is capable of delivering chemical drugs into brain tumors. This multifunction endows siRNA micelles with great potential as an RNAi nanomedicine or drug delivery platform for glioblastoma therapy.








Abstract
Nanoparticle&#8208;based small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapy shows great promise for glioblastoma (GBM). However, charge associated toxicity and limited blood&#8211;brain&#8208;barrier (BBB) penetration remain significant challenges for siRNA delivery for GBM therapy. Herein, novel cation&#8208;free siRNA micelles, prepared by the self&#8208;assembly of siRNA&#8208;disulfide&#8208;poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (siRNA&#8208;SS&#8208;PNIPAM) diblock copolymers, are prepared. The siRNA micelles not only display enhanced blood circulation time, superior cell take&#8208;up, and effective at&#8208;site siRNA release, but also achieve potent BBB penetration. Moreover, due to being non&#8208;cationic, these siRNA micelles exert no charge&#8208;associated toxicity. Notably, these desirable properties of this novel RNA interfering (RNAi) nanomedicine result in outstanding growth inhibition of orthotopic U87MG xenografts without causing adverse effects, achieving remarkably improved survival benefits. Moreover, as a novel type of polymeric micelle, the siRNA micelle displays effective drug loading ability. When utilizing temozolomide (TMZ) as a model loading drug, the siRNA micelle realizes effective synergistic therapy effect via targeting the key gene (signal transducers and activators of transcription 3, STAT3) in TMZ drug resistant pathways. The authors&#8217; results show that this siRNA micelle nanoparticle can serve as a robust and versatile drug codelivery platform, and RNAi nanomedicine and for effective GBM treatment.

         <title>Boron Nitride Nanosheets Can Induce Water Channels Across Lipid Bilayers Leading to Lysosomal Permeabilization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interactions of hexagonal boron nitride nanosheets with cells are revealed using a combination of molecular dynamics simulations, liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation, and in vitro imaging methods. Lipid bilayer penetration occurs through a cross&#8208;membrane water channel formation, opening the door to a better understanding of the potential cytotoxicity mechanisms of 2D materials and their biomedical applications.








Abstract
While the interaction between 2D materials and cells is of key importance to the development of nanomedicines and safe applications of nanotechnology, still little is known about the biological interactions of many emerging 2D materials. Here, an investigation of how hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) interacts with the cell membrane is carried out by combining molecular dynamics (MD), liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation, and in vitro imaging methods. MD simulations reveal that a sharp hBN wedge can penetrate a lipid bilayer and form a cross&#8208;membrane water channel along its exposed polar edges, while a round hBN sheet does not exhibit this behavior. It is hypothesized that such water channels can facilitate cross&#8208;membrane transport, with important consequences including lysosomal membrane permeabilization, an emerging mechanism of cellular toxicity that involves the release of cathepsin B and generation of radical oxygen species leading to cell apoptosis. To test this hypothesis, two types of hBN nanosheets, one with a rhomboidal, cornered morphology and one with a round morphology, are prepared, and human lung epithelial cells are exposed to both materials. The cornered hBN with lateral polar edges results in a dose&#8208;dependent cytotoxic effect, whereas round hBN does not cause significant toxicity, thus confirming our&#160;premise.

         <title>Freestanding Ferroelectric Bubble Domains</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferroelectric bubble&#8208;like domains, a precursor to electrical skyrmions, arise in epitaxially clamped complex oxide heterostructures. These specially ordered electric dipoles are stable in a freestanding state despite the presence of inhomogeneously distributed structural ripples. This finding opens the door to explore electric skyrmions with arbitrary boundaries and physically flexible topological orders in ferroelectric curvilinear space.








Abstract
Bubble&#8208;like domains, typically a precursor to the electrical skyrmions, arise in ultrathin complex oxide ferroelectric&#8211;dielectric&#8211;ferroelectric heterostructures epitaxially clamped with flat substrates. Here, it is reported that these specially ordered electric dipoles can also be retained in a freestanding state despite the presence of inhomogeneously distributed structural ripples. By probing local piezo and capacitive responses and using atomistic simulations, this study analyzes these ripples, sheds light on how the bubbles are stabilized in the modified electromechanical energy landscape, and discusses the difference in morphology between bubbles in freestanding and as&#8208;grown states. These results are anticipated to be the starting point of a new paradigm for the exploration of electric skyrmions with arbitrary boundaries and physically flexible topological orders in ferroelectric curvilinear space.

         <title>Molten&#8208;Salt&#8208;Assisted CsPbI3 Perovskite Crystallization for Nearly 20%&#8208;Efficiency Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molten&#8208;salt&#8208;assisted crystallization (MSAC) strategy is developed to improve the grain growth of all&#8208;inorganic perovskite films. MSAC enables more active mass transfer and interaction among precursor colloids. Devices based on the MSAC strategy show much increased  efficiency to as high as 19.83% with open&#8208;circuit voltage as high as 1.2 V.








Abstract
Dynamic manipulation of crystallization is pivotal to the quality of polycrystalline films. A molten&#8208;salt&#8208;assisted crystallization (MSAC) strategy is presented to improve grain growth of the all&#8208;inorganic perovskite films. Compared with the traditional solvent annealing, MSAC enables more intensive mass transfer by means of convection and diffusion, which is beneficial to the interaction among the precursor colloids and to inducing in&#8208;plane growth of perovskite grains, resulting in the formation of high&#8208;quality perovskite films with suppressed pinhole and crack formation. Additionally, the introduction of molten salt alters the intermediate phases, and thus changes the crystallization pathways by reducing the energy barrier to produce films with desired optical and electrical properties. As a result, the MSAC strategy endows the devices with champion steady&#8208;state output efficiency of 19.83% and open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) as high as 1.2&#160;V, among the highest for this type of solar cell, thanks to its effectively reduced Voc deficit.

         <title>Visualizing Van der Waals Epitaxial Growth of 2D Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new growth mode of 2D van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures with distinctly different morphologies and growth rates from the conventional mode is observed using a custom&#8208;built system integrating physical vapor deposition with in situ optical microscopy/Raman spectroscopy. A model to explain these two growth modes is proposed, which appears to be applicable to 2D vdW heterostructures in general.








Abstract
Understanding the growth mechanisms of 2D van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures is of great importance in exploring their functionalities and device applications. A custom&#8208;built system integrating physical vapor deposition and optical microscopy/Raman spectroscopy is employed to study the dynamic growth processes of 2D vdW heterostructures in situ. This allows the identification of a new growth mode with a distinctly different growth rate and morphology from those of the conventional linear growth mode. A model that explains the difference in morphologies and quantifies the growth rates of the two modes by taking the role of surface diffusion into account is proposed. A range of material combinations including CdI2/WS2, CdI2/MoS2, CdI2/WSe2, PbI2/WS2, PbI2/MoS2, PbI2/WSe2, and Bi2Se3/WS2 is systematically investigated. These findings may be generalized to the synthesis of many other 2D heterostructures with controlled morphologies and physical properties, benefiting future device applications.

         <title>Construction of Messenger RNA (mRNA) Probes Delivered By Lipid Nanoparticles to Visualize Intracellular Protein Expression and Localization at Organelles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of mRNA probes is designed to image specific organelles. When delivered by lipid nanoparticles, these mRNA probes enable the visualization of intracellular protein trafficking and localization in cells. Moreover, these mRNA probes can also be applied to visualize specific organelles in vivo.








Abstract
Organelles are specialized compartments, where various proteins reside and play crucial roles to maintain essential cellular structures and functions in mammalian cells. A comprehensive understanding of protein expressions and subsequent localizations at each organelle is of great benefit to the development of organelle&#8208;based therapies. Herein, a set of single or dual organelle labeling messenger RNAs (SOLAR or DOLAR) is designed as novel imaging probes, which encode fluorescent proteins with various organelle localization signals. These mRNA probes enable to visualize the protein localizations at different organelles and investigate their trafficking from ribosomal machinery to specific organelles. According to the in vitro results, SOLAR probes show organelle targeting capabilities consistent with the design. Moreover, DOLAR probes with different linkers display distinct targeting properties depending on different organelle localization signals. Additionally, these mRNA probes also exhibit organelle labeling ability in vivo when delivered by lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). Therefore, these mRNA&#8208;based probes provide a unique tool to study cell organelles and may facilitate the design of organelle&#8208;based therapies.

         <title>NanoRobotic Structures with Embedded Actuation via Ion Induced Folding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel fabrication method for 4D nanorobotic systems via ion&#8208;induced folding is introduced. By tailoring the patterning and folding parameters, dynamic 4D microstructures with personalized properties are achieved using planar multilayer structures obtained by batch fabrication. High nanorobotic performances are demonstrated theoretically and experimentally through a folded gripper.








Abstract
4D structures are tridimensional structures with time&#8208;varying abilities that provide high versatility, sophisticated designs, and a broad spectrum of actuation and sensing possibilities. The downsizing of these structures below 100 &#956;m opens up exceptional opportunities for many disciplines, including photonics, acoustics, medicine, and nanorobotics. However, it requires a paradigm shift in manufacturing methods, especially for dynamic structures. A novel fabrication method based on ion&#8208;induced folding of planar multilayer structures embedding their actuation is proposed&#8212;the planar structures are fabricated in bulk through batch microfabrication techniques. Programmable and accurate bidirectional foldings (&#8722;70&#176;&#160;&#8722;&#160;+90&#176;) of Silica/Chromium/Aluminium (SiO2/Cr/Al) multilayer structures are modeled, experimentally demonstrated then applied to embedded electrothermal actuation of controllable and dynamic 4D nanorobotic structures. The method is used to produce high&#8208;performances case&#8208;study grippers for nanorobotic applications in confined environments. Once folded, a gripping task at the nano&#8208;scale is demonstrated. The proposed fabrication method is suitable for creating small&#8208;scale 4D systems for nanorobotics, medical devices, and tunable metamaterials, where rapid folding and enhanced dynamic control are required.

Antiviral Coatings
During the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic, robust and effective antimicrobial and antiviral fabrics have been required. In article 2104298, Michael D. Dickey, Vi Khanh Truong, Tae&#8208;il Kim, and co&#8208;workers propose an easy&#8208;to&#8208;control and straightforward method to coat gallium liquid metal (LM) particles on a wide range of fabrics to facilitate the deposition of liquid metal copper alloy (LMCu) particles. This coating can offer robust adhesion on fabrics and provides huge potential toward rapid eradication of a wide range of bacteria, fungi, and viruses.

Skyrmion Generation/Deletion
The generation/deletion of magnetic skyrmions at a specific area on a device is the most demanding issue in skyrmionics. In article number 2104406, Chanyong Hwang and co&#8208;workers introduce a recipe for magnetic skyrmion generation/deletion. A vertically injected current pulse induces skyrmion generation/deletion one by one depending on the polarity. Using this vertical&#8208;current concept with a spin&#8211;orbit&#8208;torque&#8208;driven skyrmion  shifting, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of skyrmion racetrack memory is presented.

Tumor Therapy
In article number 2104779, Meng Zheng, Bingyang Shi, and co&#8208;workers develop a kind of polymeric siRNA micelle as an effective drug&#8208;delivery platform and potent RNAi nanomedicine for glioblastoma therapy. The siRNA micelles are capable of traversing the blood&#8211;brain barrier via transcytosis mediated by scavenger receptors, to subsequently target a brain tumor and then exert potent RNAi therapy or RNAi&#8208;Chemo synergistic therapy.

Flexible Electronics
In article number 2104446, Takafumi Uemura, Tsuyoshi Sekitani, and co&#8208;workers report the modulation of charge carriers in ultraflexible organic integrated circuits. This is achieved by introducing heterogeneous functional dielectric patterns through ultraviolet&#8208;light irradiation. Consequently, the threshold voltage is precisely controlled from negative to even positive values, and performance metrics of ultraflexible integrated circuits are maximized.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Flexible Electronics&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In article number &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202104446"&gt;2104446&lt;/a&gt;, Takafumi Uemura, Tsuyoshi Sekitani, and co-workers report the modulation of charge carriers in ultraflexible organic integrated circuits. This is achieved by introducing heterogeneous functional dielectric patterns through ultraviolet-light irradiation. Consequently, the threshold voltage is precisely controlled from negative to even positive values, and performance metrics of ultraflexible integrated circuits are maximized.

         <title>Application of Triplet&#8211;Triplet Annihilation Upconversion in Organic Optoelectronic Devices: Advances and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive summary of advances toward developing efficient triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation (TTA) upconversion materials and their application in optoelectronic devices is systematically given. The key challenges and perspectives of TTA upconversion systems for further improvement for optoelectronic devices and other related research directions are provided. This review hopes to provide valuable guidelines for future advancement in organic optoelectronics.








Abstract
Organic semiconductor materials have been widely used in various optoelectronic devices due to their rich optical and/or electrical properties, which are highly related to their excited states. Therefore, how to manage and utilize the excited states in organic semiconductors is essential for the realization of high&#8208;performance optoelectronic devices. Triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation (TTA) upconversion is a unique process of converting two non&#8208;emissive triplet excitons to one singlet exciton with higher energy. Efficient optical&#8208;to&#8208;electrical devices can be realized by harvesting sub&#8208;bandgap photons through TTA&#8208;based upconversion. In electrical&#8208;to&#8208;optical devices, triplets generated after the combination of electrons and holes also can be efficiently utilized via TTA, which resulted in a high internal conversion efficiency of 62.5%. Currently, many interesting explorations and significant advances have been demonstrated in these fields. In this review, a comprehensive summary of these intriguing advances on developing efficient TTA upconversion materials and their application in optoelectronic devices is systematically given along with some discussions. Finally, the key challenges and perspectives of TTA upconversion systems for further improvement for optoelectronic devices and other related research directions are provided. This review hopes to provide valuable guidelines for future related research and advancement in organic optoelectronics.

         <title>Updated Insights into 3D Architecture Electrodes for Micropower Sources</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D architecture electrode design enhances  energy storage capability within a limited footprint area. The superiority of 3D architecture electrodes for performance improvement of microbatteries and microsupercapacitors is comprehensively addressed. The most recent research  advances, current challenges, and future perspectives are outlined and discussed.








Abstract
Microbatteries (MBs) and microsupercapacitors (MSCs) are primary on&#8208;chip micropower sources that drive autonomous and stand&#8208;alone microelectronic devices for implementation of the Internet of Things (IoT). However, the performance of conventional MBs and MSCs is restricted by their 2D thin&#8208;film electrode design, and these devices struggle to satisfy the increasing IoT energy demands for high energy density, high power density, and long lifespan. The energy densities of MBs and MSCs can be improved significantly through adoption of a 2D thick&#8208;film electrode design; however, their power densities and lifespans deteriorate with increased electrode thickness. In contrast, 3D architecture electrodes offer remarkable opportunities to simultaneously improve MB and MSC energy density, power density, and lifespan. To date, various 3D architecture electrodes have been designed, fabricated, and investigated for MBs and MSCs. This review provides an update on the principal superiorities of 3D architecture electrodes over 2D thick&#8208;film electrodes in the context of improved MB and MSC energy density, power density, and lifespan. In addition, the most recent and representative progress in 3D architecture electrode development for MBs and MSCs is highlighted. Finally, present challenges are discussed and key perspectives for future research in this field are outlined.

         <title>Bioengineering Approaches for the Advanced Organoid Research</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emergence of organoid technologies, in terms of development of 3D miniature organs in vitro, has provided revolutionized approaches for understanding developmental processes and disease modeling. Comprehensive insights into the materials and genome engineering techniques applied to organoid culture are demonstrated. Based on the recent achievements, prospects and key challenges for the next&#8208;generation organoid technologies are also discussed.








Abstract
Recent advances in 3D cell culture technology have enabled scientists to generate stem cell derived organoids that recapitulate the structural and functional characteristics of native organs. Current organoid technologies have been striding toward identifying the essential factors for controlling the processes involved in organoid development, including physical cues and biochemical signaling. There is a growing demand for engineering dynamic niches characterized by conditions that resemble in vivo organogenesis to generate reproducible and reliable organoids for various applications. Innovative biomaterial&#8208;based and advanced engineering&#8208;based approaches have been incorporated into conventional organoid culture methods to facilitate the development of organoid research. The recent advances in organoid engineering, including extracellular matrices and genetic modulation, are comprehensively summarized to pinpoint the parameters critical for organ&#8208;specific patterning. Moreover, perspective trends in developing tunable organoids in response to exogenous and endogenous cues are discussed for next&#8208;generation developmental studies, disease modeling, and therapeutics.

         <title>Evolution of Graphene Patterning: From Dimension Regulation to Molecular Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphene patterning has attracted widespread attention owing to its ability to tailor the structures and properties of graphene, targeting high&#8208;tech applications. The established strategies have been evolved from the initial dimension regulation to the emerging molecular engineering of graphene sheets. In general, these methods can be divided into top&#8208;down/bottom&#8208;up and chemical patterning routes as comprehensively discussed in this review.








Abstract
The realization that nanostructured graphene featuring nanoscale width can confine electrons to open its bandgap has aroused scientists&#8217; attention to the regulation of graphene structures, where the concept of graphene patterns emerged. Exploring various effective methods for creating graphene patterns has led to the birth of a new field termed graphene patterning, which has evolved into the most vigorous and intriguing branch of graphene research during the past decade. The efforts in this field have resulted in the development of numerous strategies to structure graphene, affording a variety of graphene patterns with tailored shapes and sizes. The established patterning approaches combined with graphene chemistry yields a novel chemical patterning route via molecular engineering, which opens up a new era in graphene research. In this review, the currently developed graphene patterning strategies is systematically outlined, with emphasis on the chemical patterning. In addition to introducing the basic concepts and the important progress of traditional methods, which are generally categorized into top&#8208;down, bottom&#8208;up technologies, an exhaustive review of established protocols for emerging chemical patterning is presented. At the end, an outlook for future development and challenges is proposed.

         <title>Extreme Environmental Thermal Shock Induced Dislocation&#8208;Rich Pt Nanoparticles Boosting Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An environmental high&#8208;temperature thermal&#8208;shock method is proposed to generate dislocation&#8208;rich Pt nanoparticles in a liquid&#8208;nitrogen cooling medium. Structural stress and thermal stress trigger the formation of dislocations. The fast&#8208;cooling rate makes dislocations kinetically frozen in nanoparticles. The strain induced by dislocations downshifts the d&#8208;band center of the Pt, leading to weakened adsorption energy between the metal and reaction intermediates.








Abstract
Crystal structure engineering of nanomaterials is crucial for the design of electrocatalysts. Inducing dislocations is an efficient approach to generate strain effects in nanomaterials to optimize the crystal and electronic structures and improve the catalytic properties. However, it is almost impossible to produce and retain dislocations in commercial mainstream catalysts, such as single metal platinum (Pt) catalysts. In this work, a non&#8208;equilibrium high&#8208;temperature (&gt;1400 K) thermal&#8208;shock method is reported to induce rich dislocations in Pt nanocrystals (Dr&#8208;Pt). The method is performed in an extreme environment (&#8776;77 K) created by liquid nitrogen. The dislocations induced within milliseconds by thermal and structural stress during the crystallization process are kinetically frozen at an ultrafast cooling rate. The high&#8208;energy surface structures with dislocation&#8208;induced strain effects can prevent surface restructuring during catalysis. The findings indicate that a novel extreme environmental high&#8208;temperature thermal&#8208;shock method can successfully introduce rich dislocations in Pt nanoparticles and significantly boost its hydrogen evolution reaction performance.

         <title>Modeling the Triboelectric Behaviors of Elastomeric Nonwoven Fabrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An analytical model is developed for nonwoven&#8208;based triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) working at conductor&#8208;to&#8208;dielectric contact mode. The model fits well with different sets of experimental data at reasonable mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and suggests that nonwoven triboelectric output reaches a maximum at a specific thickness, solidity, or average fiber diameter when other structural parameters are fixed.








Abstract
Theoretical modeling of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) is fundamental to their performance optimization, since it can provide useful guidance on the material selection, structure design, and parameter control of relevant systems. Built on the theoretical model of film&#8208;based TENGs, here, an analytical model is introduced for conductor&#8208;to&#8208;dielectric contact&#8208;mode nonwoven&#8208;based TENGs, which copes with the unique hierarchical structure of nonwovens and details the correlation between the triboelectric output (maximum transferred charge density) and nonwoven structural parameters (thickness, solidity, and average fiber diameter). A series of styrene&#8211;ethylene&#8211;butylene&#8211;styrene nonwoven samples are fabricated through a melt&#8208;blowing process to map nonwoven structural features within certain ranges, while an ion&#8208;injection protocol is adopted to quantify the triboelectric output with superior consistency and reproducibility. With a database containing structural features and triboelectric output of 43 nonwoven samples, a good model fitting is achieved via nonlinear regression analysis in Python, which also shows good predictive power and suggests the existing of tribo&#8208;output maxima at a specific thickness, solidity, or average fiber diameter when other structural parameters are fixed. The model is also successfully applied to a group of polypropylene meltblown nonwovens, which verifies its universality on meltblown&#8208;nonwoven&#8208;based TENGs.

         <title>Ultralow Thermal Conductivity, Multiband Electronic Structure and High Thermoelectric Figure of Merit in TlCuSe</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semiconductors with ultralow lattice thermal conductivities and high power factors at the same time are scarce but fundamentally interesting in understanding thermoelectric energy conversion. TlCuSe exhibiting intrinsically ultralow thermal conductivity (0.25 W m&#8211;1 K&#8211;1), a high power factor (11.6 &#956;W cm&#8211;1 K&#8211;1), and a high figure of merit ZT (1.9) at 643 K is described.








Abstract
The entanglement of lattice thermal conductivity, electrical conductivity, and Seebeck coefficient complicates the process of optimizing thermoelectric performance in most thermoelectric materials. Semiconductors with ultralow lattice thermal conductivities and high power factors at the same time are scarce but fundamentally interesting and practically important for energy conversion. Herein, an intrinsic p&#8208;type semiconductor TlCuSe that has an intrinsically ultralow thermal conductivity (0.25 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1), a high power factor (11.6&#160;&#181;W cm&#8722;1 K&#8722;2), and a high figure of merit, ZT (1.9) at 643 K is described. The weak chemical bonds, originating from the filled antibonding orbitals p&#8208;d* within the edge&#8208;sharing CuSe4 tetrahedra and long Tl&#63743;Se bonds in the PbClF&#8208;type structure, in conjunction with the large atomic mass of Tl lead to an ultralow sound velocity. Strong anharmonicity, coming from Tl+ lone&#8208;pair electrons, boosts phonon&#8211;phonon scattering rates and further suppresses lattice thermal conductivity. The multiband character of the valence band structure contributing to power factor enhancement benefits from the lone&#8208;pair electrons of Tl+ as well, which modify the orbital character of the valence bands, and pushes the valence band maximum off the &#915;&#8208;point, increasing the band degeneracy. The results provide new insight on the rational design of thermoelectric materials.

         <title>Additives for Ambient 3D Printing with Visible Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rapid visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced polymerization of commercially relevant acrylics and concomitant 3D printing under ambient conditions is made possible with thiol additives acting as oxygen scavengers. The tadpole and frog are 3D printed using energy efficient red light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), metaphorically representing the transformative advance that allows additive manufacturing (or breathing for the frog) in air.








Abstract
With 3D printing, the desire is to be &#8220;limited only by imagination,&#8221; and although remarkable advancements have been made in recent years, the scope of printable materials remains narrow compared to other forms of manufacturing. Light&#8208;driven polymerization methods for 3D printing are particularly attractive due to unparalleled speed and resolution, yet the reliance on high&#8208;energy UV/violet light in contemporary processes limits the number of compatible materials due to pervasive absorption, scattering, and degradation at these short wavelengths. Such issues can be addressed with visible&#8208;light photopolymerizations. However, these lower&#8208;energy methods often suffer from slow reaction times and sensitivity to oxygen, precluding their utility in 3D printing processes that require rapid hardening (curing) to maximize build speed and resolution. Herein, multifunctional thiols are identified as simple additives to enable rapid high&#8208;resolution visible&#8208;light 3D printing under ambient (atmospheric O2) conditions that rival modern UV/violet&#8208;based technology. The present process is universal, providing access to commercially relevant acrylic resins with a range of disparate mechanical responses from strong and stiff to soft and extensible. Pushing forward, the insight presented within this study will inform the development of next&#8208;generation 3D&#8208;printing materials, such as multicomponent hydrogels and composites.

         <title>Direct Chemical Vapor Deposition Synthesis of Porous Single&#8208;Layer Graphene Membranes with High Gas Permeances and Selectivities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous single&#8208;layer graphene membranes for gas separation are synthesized by one&#8208;step chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Highly dense gas&#8208;sieving pores are created in graphene by tuning the CVD parameters. The resulting graphene membranes exhibit record&#8208;high H2/CH4 separation performance to date: H2/CH4 selectivity &gt;&#160;2000 while H2 permeance &gt;&#160;4000 GPU.








Abstract
Single&#8208;layer graphene containing molecular&#8208;sized in&#8208;plane pores is regarded as a promising membrane material for high&#8208;performance gas separations due to its atomic thickness and low gas transport resistance. However, typical etching&#8208;based pore generation methods cannot decouple pore nucleation and pore growth, resulting in a trade&#8208;off between high areal pore density and high selectivity.

&lt;p&gt;Porous single-layer graphene membranes for gas separation are synthesized by one-step chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Highly dense gas-sieving pores are created in graphene by tuning the CVD parameters. The resulting graphene membranes exhibit record-high H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; separation performance to date: H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity &amp;gt;&#160;2000 while H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; permeance &amp;gt;&#160;4000 GPU.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single-layer graphene containing molecular-sized in-plane pores is regarded as a promising membrane material for high-performance gas separations due to its atomic thickness and low gas transport resistance. However, typical etching-based pore generation methods cannot decouple pore nucleation and pore growth, resulting in a trade-off between high areal pore density and high selectivity. In contrast, intrinsic pores in graphene formed during chemical vapor deposition are not created by etching. Therefore, intrinsically porous graphene can exhibit high pore density while maintaining its gas selectivity. In this work, the density of intrinsic graphene pores is systematically controlled for the first time, while appropriate pore sizes for gas sieving are precisely maintained. As a result, single-layer graphene membranes with the highest H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; separation performances recorded to date (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; permeance &amp;gt;&#160;4000 GPU and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity &amp;gt;&#160;2000) are fabricated by manipulating growth temperature, precursor concentration, and non-covalent decoration of the graphene surface. Moreover, it is identified that nanoscale molecular fouling of the graphene surface during gas separation where graphene pores are partially blocked by hydrocarbon contaminants under experimental conditions, controls both selectivity and temperature dependent permeance. Overall, the direct synthesis of porous single-layer graphene exploits its tremendous potential as high-performance gas-sieving membranes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Suppressing Interface Strain for Eliminating Double&#8208;Slope Behaviors: Towards Ideal Conformable Polymer Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interface strain between film and substrate is first found to play the crucial role in determining device ideality. The release of strain by peeling can reduce the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance, which decreases oxygen doped carriers, thereby realizing ideal polymer field&#8208;effect transistors (PFETs). The work clarifies the effect of interface strain on the device ideality, offering useful guidance for constructing ideal conformable PFETs.








Abstract
High&#8208;mobility polymer field&#8208;effect transistors (PFETs) are being actively explored for applications in soft electronic skin and low&#8208;cost flexible displays because of their superior solution processability, mechanical flexibility, and stretchability. However, most of high&#8208;mobility PFETs often deviate from the idealized behavior with variable mobility, large threshold voltage, and high off&#8208;state current, which masks their intrinsic properties and significantly impedes their practical applications. Here, it is first revealed that interface strain between polymer thin film and rigid substrate plays a crucial role in determining the ideality of PFETs, and demonstrate that various ideal conformable PFETs can be successfully fabricated by releasing strain. It is found that strain in film can be released by one&#8208;step peeling strategy, which can reduce &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking distance and suppress generation of oxygen doped carriers, thereby obtaining linearly injected charge carriers and decreased carrier concentration in channel, eventually realizing ideal PFETs. More impressively, the fabricated ideal conformable PFET array displays outstanding conformability to curved objects, and meanwhile showing excellent organic light&#8208;emitting display driving capability. The work clarifies the effect of the interface strain on the device ideality, and strain can be effectively released by a facile peeling strategy, thus offering useful guidance for the construction of ideal conformable PFETs.

         <title>Miniaturized VIS&#8208;NIR Spectrometers Based on Narrowband and Tunable Transmission Cavity Organic Photodetectors with Ultrahigh Specific Detectivity above 1014 Jones</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new concept of innovative transmission cavities combined with organic photodetectors (OPDs) is proposed to achieve narrowband photodetection from the VIS to the NIR region. With this approach, an ultrahigh specific detectivity above 1014 Jones is achieved and is integrated into a miniaturized spectrometer, representing a significant step toward applying OPDs as an attractive alternative for mobile spectrometric sensing.








Abstract
Spectroscopic photodetection plays a key role in many emerging applications such as context&#8208;aware optical sensing, wearable biometric monitoring, and biomedical imaging. Photodetectors based on organic semiconductors open many new possibilities in this field. However, ease of processing, tailorable optoelectronic properties, and sensitivity for faint light are still significant challenges. Here, the authors report a novel concept for a tunable spectral detector by combining an innovative transmission cavity structure with organic absorbers to yield narrowband organic photodetection in the wavelength range of 400&#8211;1100&#160;nm, fabricated in a full&#8208;vacuum process. Benefiting from this strategy, one of the best performed narrowband organic photodetectors is achieved with a finely wavelength&#8208;selective photoresponse (full&#8208;width&#8208;at&#8208;half&#8208;maximum of &#8776;40&#160;nm), ultrahigh specific detectivity above 1014 Jones, the maximum response speed of 555&#160;kHz, and a large dynamic range up to 168&#160;dB. Particularly, an array of transmission cavity organic photodetectors is monolithically integrated on a small substrate to showcase a miniaturized spectrometer application, and a true proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept transmission spectrum measurement is successfully demonstrated. The excellent performance, the simple device fabrication as well as the possibility of high integration of this new concept challenge state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art low&#8208;noise silicon photodetectors and will mature the spectroscopic photodetection into technological realities.

         <title>Crystallographic&#8208;Site&#8208;Specific Structural Engineering Enables Extraordinary Electrochemical Performance of High&#8208;Voltage LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 Spinel Cathodes for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
Crystallographic&#8208;site&#8208;specific structural engineering is performed on the cathode material structure for lithium&#8208;ion batteries, aiming at the root causes of the instability based on the fundamental structure/function relationship. The high&#8208;voltage spinel LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO) cathode with Fd3&#175;m space group symmetry is employed as a representative, of which two issue&#8208;involved crystallographic sites are directly and simultaneously addressed, contributing to an extraordinarily excellent battery performance.








Abstract
The development of reliable and safe high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries is hindered by the structural instability of cathode materials during cycling, arising as a result of detrimental phase transformations occurring at high operating voltages alongside the loss of active materials induced by transition metal dissolution. Originating from the fundamental structure/function relation of battery materials, the authors purposefully perform crystallographic&#8208;site&#8208;specific structural engineering on electrode material structure, using the high&#8208;voltage LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO) cathode as a representative, which directly addresses the root source of structural instability of the Fd3&#175;m structure. By employing Sb as a dopant to modify the specific issue&#8208;involved 16c and 16d sites simultaneously, the authors successfully transform the detrimental two&#8208;phase reaction occurring at high&#8208;voltage into a preferential solid&#8208;solution reaction and significantly suppress the loss of Mn from the LNMO structure. The modified LNMO material delivers an impressive 99% of its theoretical specific capacity at 1 C, and maintains 87.6% and 72.4% of initial capacity after 1500 and 3000 cycles, respectively. The issue&#8208;tracing site&#8208;specific structural tailoring demonstrated for this material will facilitate the rapid development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Nanosecond&#8208;Pulsed Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes at High Current Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;speed pulsed operation of perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes is achieved with a rise time of 1.2&#160;ns. The temporal response provides access to transient charge carrier dynamics under electrical excitation, revealing several new electroluminescence quenching pathways. Furthermore, the integration of Bragg gratings enhances the forward radiance more than two&#8208;fold, with a maximum of approximately 1200 kW sr&#8722;1m&#8722;2 at 8.5 kA cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
While metal&#8208;halide perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) hold the potential for a new generation of display and lighting technology, their slow operation speed and response time limit their application scope. Here, high&#8208;speed PeLEDs driven by nanosecond electrical pulses with a rise time of 1.2&#160;ns are reported with a maximum radiance of approximately 480 kW sr&#8722;1&#8197;m&#8722;2 at 8.3 kA cm&#8722;2, and an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 1% at approximately 10 kA cm&#8722;2, through improved device configuration designs and material considerations. Enabled by the fast operation of PeLEDs, the temporal response provides access to transient charge carrier dynamics under electrical excitation, revealing several new electroluminescence quenching pathways.

&lt;p&gt;High-speed pulsed operation of perovskite light-emitting diodes is achieved with a rise time of 1.2&#160;ns. The temporal response provides access to transient charge carrier dynamics under electrical excitation, revealing several new electroluminescence quenching pathways. Furthermore, the integration of Bragg gratings enhances the forward radiance more than two-fold, with a maximum of approximately 1200 kW sr&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 8.5 kA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While metal-halide perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs) hold the potential for a new generation of display and lighting technology, their slow operation speed and response time limit their application scope. Here, high-speed PeLEDs driven by nanosecond electrical pulses with a rise time of 1.2&#160;ns are reported with a maximum radiance of approximately 480 kW sr&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 8.3 kA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 1% at approximately 10 kA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, through improved device configuration designs and material considerations. Enabled by the fast operation of PeLEDs, the temporal response provides access to transient charge carrier dynamics under electrical excitation, revealing several new electroluminescence quenching pathways.

         <title>Magneto&#8208;Responsive Microneedle Robots for Intestinal Macromolecule Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magneto&#8208;responsive microneedle&#8208;structured robots are developed by a building&#8208;block stacking inspired multistage 3D fabrication strategy. Such microrobots contain a polarized magnetic substrate for remote guidance, needle tips for intestinal drug release, and a separable connection for tip&#8211;substrate detachment and substrate excretion. These microrobots perform well in delivering insulin to pigs and blood glucose control, indicating their potentials in effective oral macromolecule administration.








Abstract
Oral administration is the most convenient and commonly used approach for drug delivery, while it is still a challenge to overcome the complicated gastrointestinal barriers and realize efficient macromolecular drug absorption. Here, novel magneto&#8208;responsive microneedle robots are presented for efficient oral delivery of versatile macromolecules. These microneedle robots with three components of the magnetic substrate, the separable connection, and tips are generated by a Lego&#8208;brick&#8208;stacking&#8208;inspired multistage 3D fabrication strategy. With the assistance of commercial enteric capsule encapsulation, they can be taken orally and be released when entering the small intestine. Benefitting from their polarized magnetic substrate, the tips of the microneedle robots can orient to the small intestinal wall, overcome the barriers, insert into the tissue, and deliver encapsulated actives under specific magnetic fields. Besides, after the separable connection degrades, the tips can be left inside the tissue for continuous actives release, and the magnetic substrate can be excreted safely. Based on these features, the practical values of the microneedle robots are demonstrated by using them to orally deliver insulin and efficiently regulate the blood glucose of pigs. It is believed that the proposed microneedle robots can orally deliver diverse macromolecules and thus open a new chapter for oral administration.

         <title>Efficient and Stable CsPbI3 Inorganic Perovskite Photovoltaics Enabled by Crystal Secondary Growth</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Defect&#8208;triggered phase degradation has become the main issue in the field of inorganic CsPbI3 perovskite. A crystal secondary growth of inorganic perovskites induced by a solid&#8208;state reaction to achieve defect compensation in CsPbI3 perovskite is demonstrated. Finally, the defect&#8208;compensated CsPbI3&#8208;based solar cell delivers 20.04% efficiency with excellent operational stability.








Abstract
Defect&#8208;triggered phase degradation is generally considered as the main issue that causes phase instability and limited device performance for CsPbI3 inorganic perovskites. Here, a defect compensation in CsPbI3 perovskite through crystal secondary growth of inorganic perovskites is demonstrated, and highly efficient inorganic photovoltaics are realized. This secondary growth is achieved by a solid&#8208;state reaction between a bromine salt and defective CsPbI3 perovskite. Upon solid&#8208;state reaction, the Br&#8722; ions can diffuse over the entire CsPbI3 perovskite layer to heal the undercoordinated Pb2+ and conduct certain solid&#8208;state I/Br ion exchange reaction, while the organic cations can potentially heal the Cs+ cation vacancies through coupling with [PbI6]4&#8722; octahedra. The carrier dynamics confirm that this crystal secondary growth can realize defect compensation in CsPbI3. The as&#8208;achieved defect&#8208;compensated CsPbI3 not only improves the charge dynamics but also enhances the photoactive phase stability. Finally, the CsPbI3&#8208;based solar cell delivers 20.04% efficiency with excellent operational stability. Overall, this work proposes a novel concept of defect compensation in inorganic perovskites through crystal secondary growth induced by solid&#8208;state reaction that is promising for various optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Robust Jumping Actuator with a Shrimp&#8208;Shell Architecture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is highly desirable to develop compact and robust jumping robots that can withstand severe conditions. In this work, a film jumping actuator is reported, which exhibits shrimp&#8208;shell architecture, from a conjugated ladder polymer (cLP) connected by carbon nanotube (CNT) sheets. The hierarchical porous structure ensures fast absorption and desorption of organic vapor, thereby achieving a high response rate.








Abstract
It is highly desirable to develop compact&#8208; and robust&#8208;film jumping robots that can withstand severe conditions. Besides, the demands for strong actuation force, large bending curvature in a short response time, and good environmental tolerance are significant challenges to the material design. To address these challenges, this paper reports the fabrication of a thin&#8208;film jumping actuator, which exhibits a shrimp&#8208;shell architecture, from a conjugated ladder polymer (cLP) that is connected by carbon nanotube (CNT) sheets. The hierarchical porous structure ensures the fast absorption and desorption of organic vapor, thereby achieving a high response rate. The actuator does not exhibit shape distortion at temperatures of up to 225&#160;&#176;C and in concentrated sulfuric acid, as well as when immersed in many organic solvents. This work avails a new design strategy for high&#8208;performance actuators that function under harsh and complicated conditions.

         <title>Dendritic CsSnI3 for Efficient and Flexible Near&#8208;Infrared Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The injection and transport capacity of holes is significantly stronger than electrons in CsSnI3&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes; therefore, the charge injection is manipulated by preparing a dendritic CsSnI3 structure, increasing the interface area of the perovskite/electron&#8208;transporter and the probability of radiative recombination. As a result, an efficient device is achieved with a record external quantum efficiency of 5.4%.








Abstract
All&#8208;inorganic and lead&#8208;free CsSnI3 is emerging as one of the most promising candidates for near&#8208;infrared perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (NIR Pero&#8208;LEDs), which find practical applications including facial recognition, biomedical apparatus, night vision camera, and Light Fidelity. However, in the CsSnI3&#8208;based Pero&#8208;LEDs, the holes injection is significantly higher than that of electrons, resulting in unbalanced charge injection, undesired exciton dissipation, and poor device performance. Herein, it is proposed to manage charge injection and recombination behavior by tuning the interface area of perovskite and charge&#8208;transporter. A dendritic CsSnI3 structure is prepared on the hole&#8208;transporter, only making a bottom contact with the hole&#8208;transporter and exposing all other available crystal surfaces to the electron&#8208;transporter. In other words, the interface area of perovskite/electron&#8208;transporter is significantly higher than that of perovskite/hole&#8208;transporter. Moreover, the embedding interface of perovskite/electron&#8208;transporter can spatially confine holes and electrons, increasing the radiation recombination. By taking advantage of the dendritic structure, efficient lead&#8208;free NIR Pero&#8208;LEDs are achieved with a record external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 5.4%. More importantly, the dendritic structure shows great superiorities in flexible devices, for there is almost no morphology change after 2000&#8208;cycles of bends, and the fabricated Pero&#8208;LEDs can keep 93.4% of initial EQEs after 50&#8208;cycles of bends.

More importantly, the dendritic structure shows great superiorities in flexible devices, for there is almost no morphology change after 2000-cycles of bends, and the fabricated Pero-LEDs can keep 93.4% of initial EQEs after 50-cycles of bends.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Secondary Bonding Channel Design Induces Intercalation Pseudocapacitance toward Ultrahigh&#8208;Capacity and High&#8208;Rate Organic Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Traditional organic electrodes rely on functional groups. In this work, the organic compound 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylic acid is used as an example to reveal that secondary bonds for molecular stacking are connected together to form 3D channels for Li+&#8208;ion intercalation. The secondary bonding channels comprising &#63743;C&#63742;C&#63743; redox sites are identified to display intercalation pseudocapacitance, playing an important role in increasing specific capacity and rate capability.








Abstract
Organic electrode materials have shown extraordinary promise for green and sustainable electrochemical energy storage devices, but usually suffer from low specific capacity and poor rate capability, which is largely caused by inactive components and diffusion&#8208;controlled Li+ intercalation. Herein, high&#8208;rate Li+ intercalation pseudocapacitance in organic molecular crystals is achieved through introducing weak secondary bonding channels, far exceeding their theoretical capacity based on redox chemistry at functional groups. The authors&#8217; combined experimentally electrochemical characterization with first&#8208;principles calculations show that the heterocyclic organic molecule 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylic acid (BPDCA) crystal permits a four&#8208;electron redox reaction at conventional &#63743;C&#63742;O and &#63743;C&#63742;N groups and a six&#8208;electron intercalation pseudocapacitance along conjugated alkene hydrogen bonding channels (&#63743;H2NC5&#63743;H&#8943;O&#63742;C(OH)&#63743;) and heterocyclic aromatic stacking channels (&#63743;C5H3N&#8943;NH3C5&#63743;). The BPDCA electrode delivers an ultrahigh reversible capacity of 1206&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8208;1 at 0.5&#160;A&#160;g&#8208;1 and an exceptional rate capability. A 4.8&#160;V high&#8208;energy/power&#8208;density BPDCA anode&#8208;based hybrid Li&#8208;ion capacitor is thus realized. This work opens a new avenue for developing organic intercalation pseudocapacitive materials via secondary bonding structure design.

         <title>Monolayer Support Control and Precise Colloidal Nanocrystals Demonstrate Metal&#8211;Support Interactions in Heterogeneous Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interactions between coexisting metal and metal oxide phases determine the properties of heterogeneous catalysts. Atomic layer deposition and colloidal nanocrystal synthesis are combined to precisely control catalyst properties with sub&#8208;nanometer precision. Significant enhancements are observed in methane combustion activity after modification of SiO2 support with only one monolayer of Al2O3, and surface versus bulk contributions of metal&#8211;support interactions are explored.








Abstract
Electronic and geometric interactions between active and support phases are critical in determining the activity of heterogeneous catalysts, but metal&#8211;support interactions are challenging to study. Here, it is demonstrated how the combination of the monolayer&#8208;controlled formation using atomic layer deposition (ALD) and colloidal nanocrystal synthesis methods leads to catalysts with sub&#8208;nanometer precision of active and support phases, thus allowing for the study of the metal&#8211;support interactions in detail. The use of this approach in developing a fundamental understanding of support effects in Pd&#8208;catalyzed methane combustion is demonstrated. Uniform Pd nanocrystals are deposited onto Al2O3/SiO2 spherical supports prepared with control over morphology and Al2O3 layer thicknesses ranging from sub&#8208;monolayer to a &#8776;4&#160;nm thick uniform coating. Dramatic changes in catalytic activity depending on the coverage and structure of Al2O3 situated at the Pd/Al2O3 interface are observed, with even a single monolayer of alumina contributing an order of magnitude increase in reaction rate. By building the Pd/Al2O3 interface up layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer and using uniform Pd nanocrystals, this work demonstrates the importance of controlled and tunable materials in determining metal&#8211;support interactions and catalyst activity.

         <title>Congener&#8208;Induced Sulfur&#8208;Related Metabolism Interference Therapy Promoted by Photothermal Sensitization for Combating Bacteria</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanomaterial anti&#8208;implant&#8208;associated infection therapy named congener&#8208;induced sulfur&#8208;related metabolism interference therapy is proposed, based on the competitive role of selenium (Se) and sulfur (S) in bacteria metabolism as congeners. The original nanodrug MnSe2 is devised to generate permeable H2Se into bacteria and eliminated them by specific destruction of metabolic homeostasis with the promotion of photothermal sensitization.








Abstract
Metabolic homeostasis is vital for individual cells to keep alive. Stronger metabolic homeostasis allows bacteria to survive in vivo and do persistent harm to hosts, which is especially typical in implant&#8208;associated infection (IAI) with biofilm intervention. Herein, based on the competitive role of selenium (Se) and sulfur (S) in bacteria metabolism as congeners, a congener&#8208;induced sulfur&#8208;related metabolism interference therapy (SMIT) eradicating IAI is proposed by specific destruction of bacteria metabolic homeostasis. The original nanodrug manganese diselenide (MnSe2) is devised to generate permeable H2Se in bacteria, triggered by the acidic microenvironment. H2Se, the congener substitution of H2S, as a bacteria&#8208;specific intermediate metabolite, can embed itself into the H2S&#8208;utilization pathway and further alternatively disrupt the downstream sulfur&#8208;related metabolism state inside bacteria. A proteomic study indicates ribosome&#8208;related proteins are heavily downregulated and the basic metabolic pathways are mainly disordered after SMIT, revealing the destruction of bacteria metabolic homeostasis. The efficiency of SMIT is significantly promoted with the mild temperature sensitization provided by the photothermal treatment (PTT) of MnSe2 nanoparticles, verified by the proteomic study and the anti&#8208;IAI effect in vitro and in vivo. With the intelligent nanodrug, a PTT&#8208;promoted SMIT strategy against IAI is provided and a new insight into the interference design toward metabolic homeostasis with biochemical similarity is demonstrated.

         <title>Additively Manufactured Deformation&#8208;Recoverable and Broadband Sound&#8208;Absorbing Microlattice Inspired by the Concept of Traditional Perforated Panels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on traditional perforated panel concepts, a novel broadband sound&#8208;absorbing microlattice with impact&#8208;recovery multifunctionality is presented. The microlattice boasts high averaged absorption coefficients of 0.77 with mechanisms attributing to synergistic impedance matching and a combination of viscous, thermal, and structural damping dissipation. It is also pseudo&#8208;reusable with high strain recovery at 30% with no degradation of sound absorption observed.








Abstract
Noise pollution is a highly detrimental daily health hazard. Sound absorbers, such as the traditionally used perforated panels, find widespread applications. Nonetheless, modern product designs call for material novelties with enhanced performance and multifunctionality. The advent of additive manufacturing has brought about the possibilities of functional materials design to be based on structures rather than chemistry. With this in mind, herein, the traditional concept of perforated panels is revisited and is incorporated with additive manufacturing for the development of a novel microlattice&#8208;based sound absorber with additional impact resistance multifunctionality. The structurally optimized microlattice presents excellent broadband absorption with an averaged experimental absorption coefficient of 0.77 across a broad frequency range from 1000 to 6300&#160;Hz. Extensive simulation and experiments reveal absorption mechanisms to be based on viscous flow, thermal and structural damping dissipations while broadband capabilities to be on multiple resonance modes working in tandem. High deformation recovery up to 30% strain is also possible from the strut&#8208;based design and viscoelasticity of the base material. Overall, the excellent properties of the microlattice overcome tradeoffs commonly found in conventional absorbers. Additionally, this work aims to present a new paradigm: revisiting old concepts for the developments of novel materials using contemporary methods.

The structurally optimized microlattice presents excellent broadband absorption with an averaged experimental absorption coefficient of 0.77 across a broad frequency range from 1000 to 6300&#160;Hz. Extensive simulation and experiments reveal absorption mechanisms to be based on viscous flow, thermal and structural damping dissipations while broadband capabilities to be on multiple resonance modes working in tandem. High deformation recovery up to 30% strain is also possible from the strut-based design and viscoelasticity of the base material. Overall, the excellent properties of the microlattice overcome tradeoffs commonly found in conventional absorbers. Additionally, this work aims to present a new paradigm: revisiting old concepts for the developments of novel materials using contemporary methods.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrafast Interlayer Charge Separation, Enhanced Visible&#8208;Light Absorption, and Tunable Overpotential in Twisted Graphitic Carbon Nitride Bilayers for Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taking g&#8208;C3N4 as a representative example, it is theoretically found that twisted bilayers are endowed with good charge separation, ultrafast interlayer charge transfer, and enhanced visible&#8208;light absorption. Due to the induced large moir&#233; potentials, the overpotentials of HER and OER on the twisted bilayers are significantly reduced. Therefore, twist is better and of great potential in catalysis.








Abstract
Moir&#233; pattern superlattice formed by 2D van der Waals layered structures have attracted great attention for diverse applications. In experiments, the enhancement of catalytic performance in twisted bilayer systems is reported while its mechanism remains unclear. From high&#8208;accuracy first&#8208;principles and time&#8208;dependent ab initio nonadiabatic molecular dynamics calculations, ultrafast interlayer charge transfer within 120 fs, excellent charge separation, improved visible&#8208;light absorption, and satisfactory overpotentials for the hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions in twisted graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) bilayers are found, which are beneficial to photocatalytic, photo&#8208;electrocatalytic, or electrocatalytic water splitting. This work provides insightful guidance to advanced nanocatalysis based on twisted layered materials.

         <title>Atomic Scale Control and Visualization of Topological Quantum Phase Transition in &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Polymers Driven by Their Length</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Length control of &#960;&#8208;conjugated pentacene polymers leads to the observation of a topological quantum phase transition. The transition is marked by the emergence of a zero&#8208;energy in&#8208;gap edge state. A pseudo Jahn&#8211;Teller effect is identified as the driving mechanism by theoretical calculations. Furthermore, atomic manipulation with scanning tunneling microscopy allows for engineering polymers.








Abstract
Quantum phase transitions (QPTs) driven by quantum fluctuations are transitions between distinct quantum phases of matter. At present, they are poorly understood and not readily controlled. Here, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and noncontact atomic force microscopy (nc&#8208;AFM) are used to explore atomic scale control over quantum phase transitions between two different topological quantum states of a well&#8208;defined &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer. The phase transition is driven by a pseudo Jahn&#8211;Teller effect that is activated above a certain polymer chain length. In addition, theoretical calculations indicate the presence of long&#8208;lasting coherent fluctuations between the polymer's two quantum phases near the phase transition, at finite temperature. This work thus presents a new way of exploring atomic&#8208;scale control over QPTs and indicates that emerging quantum criticality in the vicinity of a QPT can give rise to new states of organic matter.

         <title>Multichannel Piezo&#8208;Ultrasound Implant with Hybrid Waterborne Acoustic Metastructure for Selective Wireless Energy Transfer at Megahertz Frequencies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel multichannel piezo&#8208;ultrasound implant (MC&#8208;PUI) is proposed, which integrates a hybrid waterborne acoustic metastructure, multiple piezo&#8208;harvesters, and a miniaturized circuit with electronic components for selective wireless control via ultrasound frequency switching. The optimized device structure that utilizes a 3D&#8208;printed air&#8208;diffraction matrix and a half&#8208;lambda Fabry&#8211;Perot resonator provides the advantage of ultrasound frequency selectivity for in vivo multifunctional operations.








Abstract
Ultrasound energy transfer (UET) is developed and integrated into various bioelectronics with diagnostic, therapeutic, and monitoring capabilities. However, existing UET platforms generally enable one function at a time due to the single ultrasound channel architecture, limiting the full potential of bioelectronics that requires multicontrol modes. Here, a multichannel piezo&#8208;ultrasound implant (MC&#8208;PUI) is presented that integrates a hybrid waterborne acoustic metastructure (HWAM), multiple piezo&#8208;harvesters, and a miniaturized circuit with electronic components for selective wireless control via ultrasound frequency switching. The HWAM that utilizes both a 3D&#8208;printed air&#8208;diffraction matrix and a half&#8208;lambda Fabry&#8211;Perot resonator is optimized to provide the advantage of ultrasound selectivity at megahertz frequencies. Complying with U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulations, frequency&#8208;controlled multifunctional operations, such as wireless charging (&#8776;11.08 &#181;W) at 3.3&#160;MHz and high&#8208;sensitivity wireless switch/control (threshold &#8776;0.55&#160;MPa) of micro&#8208;light&#8208;emitting diode/motor at 1&#160;MHz, are demonstrated ex vivo using porcine tissue and in vivo in a rat. The developed MC&#8208;PUI enhances UET versatility and opens up a new pathway for wireless implant design.

         <title>A Bioinspired Stretchable Sensory&#8208;Neuromorphic System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel form of stretchable integrated system, namely a bioinspired stretchable sensory&#8208;neuromorphic system, is presented, which comprises an artificial mechanoreceptor, an artificial synapse, and an epidermal photonic actuator as three devices. This system features a bioinspired sensory&#8208;neuromorphic system entailing tactile sensing, pattern learning/inferencing, and visualizing feedback information.








Abstract
Conventional stretchable electronics that adopt a wavy design, a neutral mechanical plane, and conformal contact between abiotic and biotic interfaces have exhibited diverse skin&#8208;interfaced applications. Despite such remarkable progress, the evolution of intelligent skin prosthetics is challenged by the absence of the monolithic integration of neuromorphic constituents into individual sensing and actuating components. Herein, a bioinspired stretchable sensory&#8208;neuromorphic system, comprising an artificial mechanoreceptor, artificial synapse, and epidermal photonic actuator is demonstrated; these three biomimetic functionalities correspond to a stretchable capacitive pressure sensor, a resistive random&#8208;access memory, and a quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diode, respectively. This system features a rigid&#8208;island structure interconnected with a sinter&#8208;free printable conductor, which is optimized by controlling the evaporation rate of solvent (&#8776;160% stretchability and &#8776;18&#160;550 S cm&#8722;1 conductivity). Devised design improves both areal density and structural reliability while avoiding the thermal degradation of heat&#8208;sensitive stretchable electronic components. Moreover, even in the skin deformation range, the system accurately recognizes various patterned stimuli via an artificial neural network with training/inferencing functions. Therefore, the new bioinspired system is expected to be an important step toward implementing intelligent wearable electronics.

         <title>A Cascade Battery: Coupling Two Sequential Electrochemical Reactions in a Single Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cascade battery that couples two sequential electrochemical reactions in a single battery is proposed. It can more fully utilize the inactive reaction chamber than traditional batteries and bypass the challenges of thick solid electrode to access high areal capacity. The cascade battery design breaks the stereotype of conventional battery configuration, paving a way for constructing two&#8208;in&#8208;one batteries.








Abstract
Currently, rechargeable electrochemical batteries generally operate on one reversible electrochemical reaction during discharging and charging cycles. Here, a cascade battery that couples two sequential electrochemical reactions in a single battery is proposed. Such a concept is demonstrated in an aqueous Zn&#8211;S hybrid battery, where solid sulfur serves as the cathode in the first discharge step and the generated Cu2S catalyzes Cu2+ reduce to Cu/Cu2O to provide the second discharge step. The cascade battery shows many merits compared to traditional batteries. First, it integrates two batteries internally, eliminating the use of additional inactive connecting materials required for external integration. Second, it can more fully utilize the inactive reaction chamber of the battery than traditional batteries. Third, cascade battery can bypass the challenges of thick solid electrode to access high areal capacity. An ultrahigh areal capacity of 48&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 is achieved even at a low solid cathode loading (9.6&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2). The cascade battery design breaks the stereotype of conventional battery configuration, providing a paradigm for constructing two&#8208;in&#8208;one batteries.

Monolithic fabrication of a flexible droplet&#8208;based electricity generator (DEG) is demonstrated by in situ growth of laser&#8208;induced graphene electrodes with different hydrophobicity in a fluorinated ethylene propylene&#8208;coated polyimide bilayer structure. The DEG exhibits high power conversion efficiency, lighting up 480 LEDs with one water droplet. More importantly, the DEG exhibits superior cyclability and operational stability under high humidity and various pH conditions.








Abstract
Laser&#8208;induced graphene (LIG) has emerged as a promising and versatile method for high&#8208;throughput graphene patterning; however, its full potential in creating complex structures and devices for practical applications is yet to be explored. In this study, an in&#8208;situ growing LIG process that enables to pattern superhydrophobic fluorine&#8208;doped graphene on fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP)&#8208;coated polyimide (PI) is demonstrated. This method leverages on distinct spectral responses of FEP and PI during laser excitation to generate the environment preferentially for LIG formation, eliminating the need for multistep processes and specific atmospheres. The structured and water&#8208;repellant structures rendered by the spectral&#8208;tuned interfacial LIG process are suitable as the electrode for the construction of a flexible droplet&#8208;based electricity generator (DEG), which exhibits high power conversion efficiency, generating a peak power density of 47.5 W m&#8722;2 from the impact of a water droplet 105&#160;&#181;L from a height of 25&#160;cm. Importantly, the device exhibits superior cyclability and operational stability under high humidity and various pH conditions. The facile process developed can be extended to realize various functional devices.

         <title>Engineering d&#8208;p Orbital Hybridization in Single&#8208;Atom Metal&#8208;Embedded Three&#8208;Dimensional Electrodes for Li&#8211;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>

A descriptor, the d&#8211;p hybridization state between single&#8208;atom metal catalysts (SACs) and sulfur species, is proposed to guide the design of SACs for Li&#8211;S batteries. The large&#8208;sized and flexible 3D electrodes with optimized SACs achieve high specific energy with low catalyst loading and high sulfur loading. The good mechanical stability for bending also shows potential for fabricating bendable/foldable Li&#8211;S batteries.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom metal catalysts (SACs) are used as sulfur cathode additives to promote battery performance, although the material selection and mechanism that govern the catalytic activity remain unclear. It is shown that d&#8208;p orbital hybridization between the single&#8208;atom metal and the sulfur species can be used as a descriptor for understanding the catalytic activity of SACs in Li&#8211;S batteries. Transition metals with a lower atomic number are found, like Ti, to have fewer filled anti&#8208;bonding states, which effectively bind lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and catalyze their electrochemical reaction. A series of single&#8208;atom metal catalysts (Me = Mn, Cu, Cr, Ti) embedded in three&#8208;dimensional (3D) electrodes are prepared by a controllable nitrogen coordination approach. Among them, the single&#8208;atom Ti&#8208;embedded electrode has the lowest electrochemical barrier to LiPSs reduction/Li2S oxidation and the highest catalytic activity, matching well with the theoretical calculations. By virtue of the highly active catalytic center of single&#8208;atom Ti on the conductive transport network, high sulfur utilization is achieved with a low catalyst loading (1&#160;wt.%) and a high area&#8208;sulfur loading (8&#160;mg cm&#8722;2). With good mechanical stability for bending, these 3D electrodes are suitable for fabricating bendable/foldable Li&#8211;S batteries for wearable electronics.

Abstract
Improving singlet oxygen (1O2) lifespan by fractionated delivery in dark and hypoxic conditions is a better way to achieve enhanced phototherapeutic efficacy. Herein, three boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) dyes are synthesized to demonstrate that anthracence&#8208;functionalized BODIPY, namely ABDPTPA is an efficient heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free photosensitizer for the reversible capture and release of 1O2. The spin&#8211;orbit charge&#8208;transfer intersystem crossing of ABDPTPA promises a high 1O2 quantum yield of 60% in dichloromethane. Under light irradiation, the anthracene group reacts with 1O2 to produce endoperoxide. Interestingly, after termination of irradiation, the endoperoxide undergoes thermal cycloreversion to produce 1O2, and regenerates the anthracene module to achieve 1O2 &#8220;afterglow,&#8221; which results in a prolonged half lifetime of 1O2 for 9.2&#160;min. In vitro cytotoxicity assays indicate that ABDPTPA nanoparticles have a low half&#8208;maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 3.6&#160;&#181;g mL&#8722;1 on U87MG cells. Further, the results of near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II fluorescence&#8208;imaging&#8208;guided phototherapy indicate that ABDPTPA nanoparticles can inhibit tumor proliferation even at a low dose (200&#160;&#181;g mL&#8722;1, 100&#160;&#181;L) without any side effects. Therefore, the study provides a generalized 1O2 &#8220;afterglow&#8221; strategy to enhance phototheranostics for complete tumor regression.

A comprehensive scaling analysis along with computational modeling provides insights into the electro&#8208;mechanical coupling and establishes the rules of engineering design and optimization for the molecular ferroelectric&#8208;based flexible sensors.








Abstract
Although excellent dielectric, piezoelectric, and pyroelectric properties matched with or even surpassing those of ferroelectric ceramics have been recently discovered in molecular ferroelectrics, their successful applications in devices are scarce. The fracture proneness of molecular ferroelectrics under mechanical loading precludes their applications as flexible sensors in bulk crystalline form. Here, self&#8208;powered flexible mechanical sensors prepared from the facile deposition of molecular ferroelectric [C(NH2)3]ClO4 onto a porous polyurethane (PU) matrix are reported. [C(NH2)3]ClO4&#8208;PU is capable of detecting pressure of 3&#160;Pa and strain of 1% that are hardly accessible by the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art piezoelectric, triboelectric, and piezoresistive sensors, and presents the ability of sensing multimodal mechanical forces including compression, stretching, bending, shearing, and twisting with high cyclic stability. This scaling analysis corroborated with computational modeling provides detailed insights into the electro&#8208;mechanical coupling and establishes rules of engineering design and optimization for the hybrid sponges. Demonstrative applications of the [C(NH2)3]ClO4&#8208;PU array suggest potential uses in interactive electronics and robotic systems.

         <title>Efficient Ion Sieving in Covalent Organic Framework Membranes with Sub&#8208;2&#8208;Nanometer Channels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin covalent organic framework membranes are constructed, where abundant hydrogen bonding sites are lined in the 1D sub&#8208;2&#8208;nm sized channels. The hydrogen&#8208;bond binding interaction between the hydrogen bonding sites and hydrated divalent cations are stronger than that of monovalent cations, enabling efficient metal ion sieving driven by the concentration gradient.








Abstract
Membranes of sub&#8208;2&#8208;nanometer channels show high ion transport rates, but it remains a great challenge to design such membranes with desirable ion selectivities for ion separation applications. Here, covalent organic framework (COF) membranes with a channel size of &#8776;1.4&#160;nm and abundant hydrogen bonding sites, exhibiting efficient ion sieving properties are demonstrated. The COF membranes have high monovalent cation permeation rates of 0.1&#8211;0.2&#160;mol m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 and extremely low multivalent cation permeabilities, leading to high monovalent over divalent ion selectivities for K+/Mg2+ of &#8776;765, Na+/Mg2+ of &#8776;680, and Li+/Mg2+ of &#8776;217. Experimental measurements and theoretical simulations reveal that the hydrogen bonding interaction between hydrated cations and the COF channel wall governs the high selectivity, and divalent cations transport through the channel needs to overcome higher energy barriers than monovalent cations. These findings provide an effective strategy for developing sub&#8208;2&#8208;nanometer sized membranes with specific interaction sites for high&#8208;efficiency ionic separation.

         <title>Skin&#8208;Integrated Devices with Soft, Holey Architectures for Wireless Physiological Monitoring, With Applications in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Material strategies and design concepts, including holey architectures, precurved layouts, and structured hydrogel adhesives, are introduced for thin, soft wireless devices that can continuously monitor vital signs in the neonatal and pediatric intensive care units. They enable mechanical and geometrical advantages, soft release of devices from the skin, improved permeability, and visual inspection of the skin through holes.








Abstract
Continuous monitoring of vital signs is an essential aspect of operations in neonatal and pediatric intensive care units (NICUs and PICUs), of particular importance to extremely premature and/or critically ill patients. Current approaches require multiple sensors taped to the skin and connected via hard&#8208;wired interfaces to external data acquisition electronics. The adhesives can cause iatrogenic injuries to fragile, underdeveloped skin, and the wires can complicate even the most routine tasks in patient care. Here, materials strategies and design concepts are introduced that significantly improve these platforms through the use of optimized materials, open (i.e., &#8220;holey&#8221;) layouts and precurved designs. These schemes 1) reduce the stresses at the skin interface, 2) facilitate release of interfacial moisture from transepidermal water loss, 3) allow visual inspection of the skin for rashes or other forms of irritation, 4) enable triggered reduction of adhesion to reduce the probability for injuries that can result from device removal. A combination of systematic benchtop testing and computational modeling identifies the essential mechanisms and key considerations. Demonstrations on adult volunteers and on a neonate in an operating NICUs illustrate a broad range of capabilities in continuous, clinical&#8208;grade monitoring of conventional vital signs, and unconventional indicators of health status.

         <title>Chaotic Organic Crystal Phosphorescent Patterns for Physical Unclonable Functions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chaotic phosphorescent patterns are developed based on an organic crystal and MoS2 heterostructure for physical unclonable functions (PUFs). The phosphorescent patterns on the MoS2 seem similar on the macroscopic scale, whereas each organic crystal exhibits highly disorder features on the microscopic scale. In image analysis, the encoding capacity as a single PUF domain achieves more than 1017 on a MoS2 small fragment.








Abstract
Since the 4th Industrial Revolution, Internet of Things based environments have been widely used in various fields ranging from mobile to medical devices. Simultaneously, information leakage and hacking risks have also increased significantly, and secure authentication and security systems are constantly required. Physical unclonable functions (PUF) are in the spotlight as an alternative. Chaotic phosphorescent patterns are developed based on an organic crystal and atomic seed heterostructure for security labels with PUFs. Phosphorescent organic crystal patterns are formed on MoS2. They seem similar on a macroscopic scale, whereas each organic crystal exhibits highly disorder features on the microscopic scale. In image analysis, an encoding capacity as a single PUF domain achieves more than 1017 on a MoS2 small fragment with lengths of 25&#160;&#181;m. Therefore, security labels with phosphorescent PUFs can offer superior randomness and no&#8208;cloning codes, possibly becoming a promising security strategy for authentication processes.

         <title>Controllable Solution&#8208;Phase Epitaxial Growth of Q1D Sb2(S,Se)3/CdS Heterojunction Solar Cell with 9.2% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solar cell device based on (hk1)&#8208;oriented Sb2(S,Se)S3 grown on top of hexagonal CdS is successfully prepared. The enhanced device performance is attributed not only to the faster charge transport along the vertically oriented (Sb4X6)n ribbons, but also to the efficient charge extraction across the heterojunction owing to the formation of favorable covalent bond at the junction.








Abstract
Antimony sulfoselenide (Sb2(S,Se)3) is a promising photoabsorber for stable and high efficiency thin film photovoltaics (PV). The unique quasi&#8208;1D (Q1D) crystal structure gives Sb2(S,Se)3 intriguing anisotropic optoelectronic properties, which intrinsically require the optimization of crystal growth orientation, especially for electronic devices with vertical charge transport such as solar cells. Although the efficiency of Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells has been improved greatly through optimizing the material quality, the fundamental issue of crystal orientation control in polycrystalline films remains unsolved, resulting in charge carrier recombination losses in the device. Herein, the epitaxial growth of vertically&#8208;oriented Sb2(S,Se)3 film on hexagonal CdS is successfully realized via a solution&#8208;based synergistic crystal growth process. The crystallographic orientation relationship between Sb2(S,Se)3 light absorber and the CdS substrate has been rigorously investigated. The best performing Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cell shows a high power conversion efficiency of 9.2% owing to the faster charge transport in the bulk and the efficient charge extraction across the heterojunction. This study points to a new direction to control the crystal growth of mixed&#8208;anion Sb2(S,Se)3, which is crucial to achieve high efficiency solar cells based on antimony chalcogenides with low dimensionality.

The unique quasi-1D (Q1D) crystal structure gives Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(S,Se)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; intriguing anisotropic optoelectronic properties, which intrinsically require the optimization of crystal growth orientation, especially for electronic devices with vertical charge transport such as solar cells. Although the efficiency of Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(S,Se)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; solar cells has been improved greatly through optimizing the material quality, the fundamental issue of crystal orientation control in polycrystalline films remains unsolved, resulting in charge carrier recombination losses in the device. Herein, the epitaxial growth of vertically-oriented Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(S,Se)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; film on hexagonal CdS is successfully realized via a solution-based synergistic crystal growth process. The crystallographic orientation relationship between Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(S,Se)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; light absorber and the CdS substrate has been rigorously investigated. The best performing Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(S,Se)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; solar cell shows a high power conversion efficiency of 9.2% owing to the faster charge transport in the bulk and the efficient charge extraction across the heterojunction. This study points to a new direction to control the crystal growth of mixed-anion Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(S,Se)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, which is crucial to achieve high efficiency solar cells based on antimony chalcogenides with low dimensionality.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Superior Sodium Storage Properties in the Anode Material NiCr2S4 for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries: An X&#8208;ray Diffraction, Pair Distribution Function, and X&#8208;ray Absorption Study Reveals a Conversion Mechanism via Nickel Extrusion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Results of an extensive study of pseudo&#8208;layered NiCr2S4 as an anode material in sodium&#8208;ion batteries are reported. Electrochemical and kinetic characteristics, X&#8208;ray absorption, diffraction, and total&#8208;scattering experiments evidence a complex and unusual charge storage mechanism: nickel extrusion and sodium insertion via formation of a NaCrS2 intermediate followed by the full conversion to nanocrystalline Ni0, Cr0, and Na2S is observed.








Abstract
The pseudo&#8208;layered sulfide NiCr2S4 exhibits outstanding electrochemical performance as anode material in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). The Na storage mechanism is investigated by synchrotron&#8208;based X&#8208;ray scattering and absorption techniques as well as by electrochemical measurements. A very high reversible capacity in the 500th cycle of 489&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 is observed at 2.0&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 in the potential window 3.0&#8211;0.1&#160;V. Full discharge includes irreversible generation of Ni0 and Cr0 nanoparticles embedded in nanocrystalline Na2S yielding shortened diffusion lengths and predominantly surface&#8208;controlled charge storage. During charge, Ni0 and Cr0 are oxidized, Na2S is consumed, and amorphous Ni and Cr sulfides are formed. Limiting the potential window to 3.0&#8211;0.3&#160;V an unusual nickel extrusion sodium insertion mechanism occurs: Ni2+ is reduced to nanosized Ni0 domains, expelled from the host lattice, and is replaced by Na+ cations to form O3&#8208;type like NaCrS2. Surprisingly, the discharge and charge processes comprise Na+ shuttling between highly crystalline NiCr2S4 and NaCrS2 enabling a superior long&#8208;term stability for 3000 cycles. The results not only provide valuable insights for the electrochemistry of conversion materials but also extend the scope of layered electrode materials considering the reversible nickel extrusion sodium insertion reaction as new concept for SIBs.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Ruthenium on Nickel Hydroxide Ultrathin Nanoribbons for Highly Efficient Hydrogen Evolution Reaction in Alkaline Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
To achieve highly efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media, atomically dispersed ruthenium (Ru) loaded nickel hydroxide ultrathin nanoribbons (R&#8208;NiRu) with extremely high aspect ratio of &#8776;100 and large Ru loading amount reaching up to &#8776;7.7&#160;wt% are synthesized via an efficient and facile one&#8208;step hydrothermal process. The R&#8208;NiRu demonstrate a superb HER performance in alkaline media.








Abstract
Achieving highly efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media is a great challenge. Single&#8208;atom catalysts with high&#8208;loading amount have attracted great interest due to their remarkable catalytic properties. Herein, by using nickel foam as the substrate, the authors design and precisely synthesize atomic ruthenium (Ru)&#8208;loaded nickel hydroxide ultrathin nanoribbons (R&#8208;NiRu) with a high atomic Ru loading amount reaching &#8776;7.7&#160;wt% via a one&#8208;step hydrothermal method. The presence of concentrated Cl&#8722; in the synthetic system is beneficial for constructing ultrathin nanoribbons, which, with abundant edge &#63743;OH groups, make it easy to trap atomic Ru. Taking advantage of the synergy between atomic Ru and the nanoribbon morphology of nickel hydroxide, R&#8208;NiRu exhibit a low overpotential of 16&#160;mV for HER at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and a Tafel slope of 40&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1 in aqueous 1.0&#160;m&#160;KOH solution, which are superior to those of commercial Pt/C (overpotential of 17&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, Tafel slope of 43&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1). Density functional theory (DFT) calculation results demonstrate that atomically dispersed Ru can significantly reduce the HER energy barrier. Moreover, R&#8208;NiRu maintains exceptional stability after 5000 cyclic voltammetry cycles. This efficient and facile synthetic strategy provides a new avenue for designing efficient catalysts.

         <title>Molecular Dopant&#8208;Dependent Charge Transport in Surface&#8208;Charge&#8208;Transfer&#8208;Doped Tungsten Diselenide Field Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using three p&#8208;type molecular dopants with different electron affinities, charge transfer processes and the scattering effects induced by dopant molecules are directly related for understanding charge transport in a molecular&#8208;doped tungsten diselenide channel. This systematic investigation of the charge transport of doped transition metal dichalcogenides(TMDCs) reveals intrinsic molecular properties that can achieve efficient and controllable molecular doping in TMDCs.








Abstract
The controllability of carrier density and major carrier type of transition metal dichalcogenides(TMDCs) is critical for electronic and optoelectronic device applications. To utilize doping in TMDC devices, it is important to understand the role of dopants in charge transport properties of TMDCs. Here, the effects of molecular doping on the charge transport properties of tungsten diselenide (WSe2) are investigated using three p&#8208;type molecular dopants, 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4&#8208;TCNQ), tris(4&#8208;bromophenyl)ammoniumyl hexachloroantimonate (magic blue), and molybdenum tris(1,2&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)ethane&#8208;1,2&#8208;dithiolene) (Mo(tfd&#8208;COCF3)3). The temperature&#8208;dependent transport measurements show that the dopant counterions on WSe2 surface can induce Coulomb scattering in WSe2 channel and the degree of scattering is significantly dependent on the dopant. Furthermore, the quantitative analysis revealed that the amount of charge transfer between WSe2 and dopants is related to not only doping density, but also the contribution of each dopant ion toward Coulomb scattering. The first&#8208;principles density functional theory calculations show that the amount of charge transfer is mainly determined by intrinsic properties of the dopant molecules such as relative frontier orbital positions and their spin configurations. The authors&#8217; systematic investigation of the charge transport of doped TMDCs will be directly relevant for pursuing molecular routes for efficient and controllable doping in TMDC nanoelectronic devices.

         <dc:description>
Air&#8208;stable large&#8208;area 2D&#8208;InxGa1&#8722;x alloys with tunable composition and no evidence of phase segregation are realized by confinement heteroepitaxy. The optical and electronic properties directly correlate with alloy composition, wherein the dielectric function, band structure, superconductivity, and charge transfer from the metal to graphene are all controlled by the indium/gallium ratio in the 2D metal layer.








Abstract
Chemically stable quantum&#8208;confined 2D metals are of interest in next&#8208;generation nanoscale quantum devices. Bottom&#8208;up design and synthesis of such metals could enable the creation of materials with tailored, on&#8208;demand, electronic and optical properties for applications that utilize tunable plasmonic coupling, optical nonlinearity, epsilon&#8208;near&#8208;zero behavior, or wavelength&#8208;specific light trapping. In this work, it is demonstrated that the electronic, superconducting, and optical properties of air&#8208;stable 2D metals can be controllably tuned by the formation of alloys. Environmentally robust large&#8208;area 2D&#8208;InxGa1&#8722;x alloys are synthesized byConfinement Heteroepitaxy (CHet). Near&#8208;complete solid solubility is achieved with no evidence of phase segregation, and the composition is tunable over the full range of x by changing the relative elemental composition of the precursor. The optical and electronic properties directly correlate with alloy composition, wherein the dielectric function, band structure, superconductivity, and charge transfer from the metal to graphene are all controlled by the indium/gallium ratio in the 2D metal layer.

         <title>Crack Suppression in Conductive Film by Amyloid&#8208;Like Protein Aggregation toward Flexible Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid amyloid&#8208;like protein nanofilm with high mechanical strength and robust interfacial adhesion shows high interfacial activity to induce electroless deposition of metal on a flexible substrate, and significantly diminishes the development of microcracks after repetitive bending or stretching of metal&#8208;coated polymer substrates. This work demonstrates the significant contribution of amyloid&#8208;like protein aggregation in the fabrication of flexible conductive devices.








Abstract
A fatal weakness in flexible electronics is the mechanical fracture that occurs during repetitive fatigue deformation; thus, controlling the crack development of the conductive layer is of prime importance and has remained a great challenge until now. Herein, this issue is tackled by utilizing an amyloid/polysaccharide molecular composite as an interfacial binder. Sodium alginate (SA) can take part in amyloid&#8208;like aggregation of the lysozyme, leading to the facile synthesis of a 2D protein/saccharide hybrid nanofilm over an ultralarge area (e.g., &gt;400&#160;cm2). The introduction of SA into amyloid&#8208;like aggregates significantly enhances the mechanical strength of the hybrid nanofilm, which, with the help of amyloid&#8208;mediated interfacial adhesion, effectively diminishes the microcracks in the hybrid nanofilm coating after repetitive bending or stretching. The microcrack&#8208;free hybrid nanofilm then shows high interfacial activity to induce electroless deposition of metal in a Kelvin model on a substrate, which noticeably suppresses the formation of microcracks and consequent conductivity loss during the bending and stretching of the metal&#8208;coated flexible substrates. This work underlines the significance of amyloid/polysaccharide nanocomposites in the design of interfacial binders for reliable flexible electronic devices and represents an important contribution to mimicking amyloid and polysaccharide&#8208;based adhesive cements created by organisms.

         <title>Synergistic Integration of Chemo&#8208;Resistive and SERS Sensing for Label&#8208;Free Multiplex Gas Detection</title>

Synergistic electrical and optical multimodal sensing by 3D nanoarchitectures for label&#8208;free gas detection is reported.








Abstract
Practical sensing applications such as real&#8208;time safety alerts and clinical diagnoses require sensor devices to differentiate between various target molecules with high sensitivity and selectivity, yet conventional devices such as oxide&#8208;based chemo&#8208;resistive sensors and metal&#8208;based surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) sensors usually do not satisfy such requirements. Here, a label&#8208;free, chemo&#8208;resistive/SERS multimodal sensor based on a systematically assembled 3D cross&#8208;point multifunctional nanoarchitecture (3D&#8208;CMA), which has unusually strong enhancements in both &#8220;chemo&#8208;resistive&#8221; and &#8220;SERS&#8221; sensing characteristics is introduced. 3D&#8208;CMA combines several sensing mechanisms and sensing elements via 3D integration of semiconducting SnO2 nanowire frameworks and dual&#8208;functioning Au metallic nanoparticles. It is shown that the multimodal sensor can successfully estimate mixed&#8208;gas compositions selectively and quantitatively at the sub&#8208;100 ppm level, even for mixtures of gaseous aromatic compounds (nitrobenzene and toluene) with very similar molecular structures. This is enabled by combined chemo&#8208;resistive and SERS multimodal sensing providing complementary information.

         <title>Superior Flexibility in Oxide Ceramic Crystal Nanofibers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible ceramic nanofibers are fabricated using a ball&#8208;milling&#8208; and curved&#8208;drafting&#8208;assisted electrospinning technique. With this strategy, continuous TiO2 nanofibers, in which orderly assembled TiO2 nanocrystals are connected by twin or amorphous grain boundaries, are formed after sintering. The single nanofiber is knottable, while the nanofiber membrane can be folded without fracture, displaying properties associated with both soft and hard matter.








Abstract
Oxide crystal ceramics are commonly hard and brittle, when they are bent they typically fracture. Such mechanical response limits the use of these materials in emerging fields like wearable electronics. Here, a polymer&#8208;induced assembly strategy is reported to construct orderly assembled TiO2 crystals into continuous nanofibers that are stretchable, bendable, and even knottable. Ball&#8208;milling the spinning sol and curved&#8208;drafting the electrospun nanofibers significantly improve the molecular structural order and reduce pore defects in the precursor nanofibers. Using this method, continuous TiO2 nanofibers, in which orderly assembled TiO2 nanocrystals (brick) are connected by twin grain boundaries or an amorphous region (mortar), are formed after sintering. Mechanical measurements and finite element analysis simulation indicate that the dislocation slip of &#8220;bricks&#8221; and the elastic deformation of &#8220;mortar&#8221; render the nanofibers with a small bending rigidity of &#8776;22 mN and a small elastic modulus of &#8776;20.8 Gpa, thus displaying properties associated with both soft and hard matter. More importantly, the reported approach can be easily extended to synthesize a wide range of soft, yet tough ceramic membranes, such as ZrO2 and SiO2.

         <title>Nature&#8208;Inspired Circular&#8208;Economy Recycling for Proteins: Proof of Concept</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mixtures of peptides and high&#8208;tech proteins (silk fibroins, &#946;&#8208;lactoglobulin films) are depolymerized into their amino acid components. Such amino acids are used as the only source of monomers for polymerizing biotechnologically relevant proteins (fluorescent proteins, catechol 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase), outside living organisms. The process is repeated multiple times showing that sequence&#8208;defined polymers can be recycled by fulfilling the principles of circular economy.








Abstract
The billion tons of synthetic&#8208;polymer&#8208;based materials (i.e. plastics) produced yearly are a great challenge for humanity. Nature produces even more natural polymers, yet they are sustainable. Proteins are sequence&#8208;defined natural polymers that are constantly recycled when living systems feed. Digestion is the protein depolymerization into amino acids (the monomers) followed by their re&#8208;assembly into new proteins of arbitrarily different sequence and function. This breaks a common recycling paradigm where a material is recycled into itself. Organisms feed off of random protein mixtures that are &#8220;recycled&#8221; into new proteins whose identity depends on the cell's specific needs. In this study, mixtures of several peptides and/or proteins are depolymerized into their amino acid constituents, and these amino acids are used to synthesize new fluorescent, and bioactive proteins extracellularly by using an amino&#8208;acid&#8208;free, cell&#8208;free transcription&#8211;translation (TX&#8211;TL) system. Specifically, three peptides (magainin II, glucagon, and somatostatin 28) are digested using thermolysin first and then using leucine aminopeptidase. The amino acids so produced are added to a commercial TX&#8211;TL system to produce fluorescent proteins. Furthermore, proteins with high relevance in materials engineering (&#946;&#8208;lactoglobulin films, used for water filtration, or silk fibroin solutions) are successfully recycled into biotechnologically relevant proteins (fluorescent proteins, catechol 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase).

In this study, mixtures of several peptides and/or proteins are depolymerized into their amino acid constituents, and these amino acids are used to synthesize new fluorescent, and bioactive proteins extracellularly by using an amino-acid-free, cell-free transcription&#8211;translation (TX&#8211;TL) system. Specifically, three peptides (magainin II, glucagon, and somatostatin 28) are digested using thermolysin first and then using leucine aminopeptidase. The amino acids so produced are added to a commercial TX&#8211;TL system to produce fluorescent proteins. Furthermore, proteins with high relevance in materials engineering (&#946;-lactoglobulin films, used for water filtration, or silk fibroin solutions) are successfully recycled into biotechnologically relevant proteins (fluorescent proteins, catechol 2,3-dioxygenase).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Approaching Nearly 40% External Quantum Efficiency in Organic Light Emitting Diodes Utilizing a Green Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitter with an Extended Linear Donor&#8211;Acceptor&#8211;Donor Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A green thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitter with an extended &#960;&#8208;system of linear donor (D)&#8211;acceptor (A)&#8211;donor (D) structure is established to simultaneously obtain a horizontal emitting dipole orientation ratio of 92%, a reverse intersystem crossing rate of 1.16 &#215; 106 s&#8211;1 and a photoluminescence quantum yield of 95%, together affording a champion maximum external quantum efficiency of 39.1%.








Abstract
Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters featuring preferential horizontal emitting dipole orientation (EDO) are in urgent demand for enhanced optical outcoupling efficiency in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). However, simultaneously manipulating EDO and optoelectronic properties remains a formidable challenge. Here, an extended linear D&#8211;A&#8211;D structure with both enlarged donor (D) and acceptor (A) &#960;&#8208;systems is established, not only elaborately manipulating parallel horizontal molecular orientation and EDO along its long axis by multi&#8208;driving&#8208;forces for a high horizontal dipole ratio (&#920;//), but also delocalizing distribution of frontier energy levels for optimized electronic properties. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;concept emitter simultaneously affords a high &#920;// of 92%, a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 95%, and a fast reverse intersystem crossing rate of 1.16 &#215; 106 s&#8208;1. The corresponding OLED achieves a champion maximum external quantum efficiency of 39.1% among all green TADF devices without any external light&#8208;extraction techniques, together with a maximum power efficiency of 112.0&#160;lm W&#8208;1 and alleviated efficiency roll&#8208;off. These findings may inspire even better full&#8208;color TADF emitters that push the device efficiency toward the theoretical limits.

         <title>Novel Ultrabright and Air&#8208;Stable Photocathodes Discovered from Machine Learning and Density Functional Theory Driven Screening</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Over 74 000 semiconducting materials are computationally screened to identify promising ultrahigh&#8208;brightness photocathode materials for use in next&#8208;generation free&#8208;electron lasers. This broad search results in the identification of novel materials that are predicted to be considerably brighter and more resistant to oxidation than the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photocathode materials.








Abstract
The high brightness, low emittance electron beams achieved in modern X&#8208;ray free&#8208;electron lasers (XFELs) have enabled powerful X&#8208;ray imaging tools, allowing molecular systems to be imaged at picosecond time scales and sub&#8208;nanometer length scales. One of the most promising directions for increasing the brightness of XFELs is through the development of novel photocathode materials. Whereas past efforts aimed at discovering photocathode materials have typically employed trial&#8208;and&#8208;error&#8208;based iterative approaches, this work represents the first data&#8208;driven screening for high brightness photocathode materials. Through screening over 74 000 semiconducting materials, a vast photocathode dataset is generated, resulting in statistically meaningful insights into the nature of high brightness photocathode materials. This screening results in a diverse list of photocathode materials that exhibit intrinsic emittances that are up to 4x lower than currently used photocathodes. In a second effort, multiobjective screening is employed to identify the family of M2O (M = Na, K, Rb) that exhibits photoemission properties that are comparable to the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photocathode materials, but with superior air stability. This family represents perhaps the first intrinsically bright, visible light photocathode materials that are resistant to reactions with oxygen, allowing for their transport and storage in dry air environments.

Gas Sensors
In article number 2105199, Yeon Sik Jung and co&#8208;workers achieve highly selective, quantitative, and multiplex detection of mixed trace level aromatic compound gases through synergistically integrated multimodal sensing. The design of the 3D cross&#8208;point multifunctional nanoarchitecture (3D&#8208;CMA) significantly enhances both chemoresistive sensing and surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy simultaneously. 3D&#8208;CMA multimodal sensors accurately identify the composition and concentrations of mixed gases with very similar molecular structures.

Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries
A descriptor, the d&#8211;p hybridization state between singleatom metal catalysts (SACs) and sulfur species, to guide the design of SACs for Li&#8211;S batteries, is proposed by Shiyong Zhao, Qianfan Zhang, Guangmin Zhou, Hui&#8208;Ming Cheng, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2105947. The large&#8208;sized and flexible 3D electrodes with optimized SACs achieve high specific energy with low catalyst loading and high sulfur loading. The good mechanical stability for bending also shows potential for fabricating bendable/foldable Li&#8211;S batteries.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A descriptor, the d&#8211;p hybridization state between singleatom metal catalysts (SACs) and sulfur species, to guide the design of SACs for Li&#8211;S batteries, is proposed by Shiyong Zhao, Qianfan Zhang, Guangmin Zhou, Hui-Ming Cheng, and co-workers in article number &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202105947"&gt;2105947&lt;/a&gt;. The large-sized and flexible 3D electrodes with optimized SACs achieve high specific energy with low catalyst loading and high sulfur loading. The good mechanical stability for bending also shows potential for fabricating bendable/foldable Li&#8211;S batteries.

Security Labeling
In article 2102542, Dong Hyuk Park, Wook Park, Sunkook Kim, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate chaotic phosphorescent patterns based on an organic crystal and MoS2 heterostructure for physical unclonable functions (PUFs). Phosphorescent&#8208;pattern&#8208;based PUFs achieve superior microscale randomness and no&#8208;cloning code with ease of fabrication. In image analysis, an encoding capacity as a single PUF domain of more than 1017 is achieved on a 25 &#956;m&#8208;cubic MoS2 sample.

In article number 2104581, Sebastian Josef Maerkl, Francesco Stellacci, and co&#8208;workers introduce an idealized representation of nature&#8208;inspired circular&#8208;economy recycling (NaCRe) for proteins, a recycling approach where generic mixtures of protein&#8208;based materials are depolymerized into their constituent amino acids, which in turn are used as the only source of monomers to produce new protein&#8208;based materials that are unrelated to the parent ones, outside living organisms.

Quantum Phase Transitions
As reported by Pavel Jelinek and co&#8208;workers in article number 2104495, length control of &#960;&#8208;conjugated pentacene polymers leads to the observation of a topological quantum phase transition. The transition is marked by the emergence of a zero&#8208;energy in&#8208;gap edge state and a pseudo Jahn&#8211;Teller effect is identified as the driving mechanism.

Abstract
Hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) has emerged as a strong candidate for two&#8208;dimensional (2D) material owing to its exciting optoelectrical properties combined with mechanical robustness, thermal stability, and chemical inertness. Super&#8208;thin h&#8208;BN layers have gained significant attention from the scientific community for many applications, including nanoelectronics, photonics, biomedical, anti&#8208;corrosion, and catalysis, among others. This review provides a systematic elaboration of the structural, electrical, mechanical, optical, and thermal properties of h&#8208;BN followed by a comprehensive account of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art synthesis strategies for 2D h&#8208;BN, including chemical exfoliation, chemical, and physical vapor deposition, and other methods that have been successfully developed in recent years. It further elaborates a wide variety of processing routes developed for doping, substitution, functionalization, and combination with other materials to form heterostructures. Based on the extraordinary properties and thermal&#8208;mechanical&#8208;chemical stability of 2D&#160;h&#8208;BN, various potential applications of these structures are described.

Underwater adhesives are in high demand from medical to ocean technology. Key specific challenges are discussed to achieve underwater adhesion, and then an overview of strategies of the existing research and the performances of underwater adhesives achieved is presented. Finally, the possible solutions for the challenges, along with future research directions are discussed.








Abstract
Underwater adhesives are in high demand in both commercial and industrial sectors. Compared with adhesives used in dry (air) environments, adhesives used for wet or submerged surfaces in aqueous environments have specific challenges in development and performance. In this review, focus is on adhesives demonstrating macroscopic adhesion to wet/underwater substrates. The current strategies are first introduced for different types of underwater adhesives, and then an overview is provided of the development and performance of underwater adhesives based on different mechanisms and strategies. Finally, the possible research directions and prospects of underwater adhesives are discussed.
