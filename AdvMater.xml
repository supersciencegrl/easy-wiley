         <title>Inter&#8208;Metal Interaction with a Threshold Effect in NiCu Dual&#8208;Atom Catalysts for CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Investigating the inter&#8208;metal site distance effect of dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) can not only promote the full potential of DACs, but also guide the design of advanced atomically&#160;dispersed catalysts. In this work a peripherally distributed NiCu DAC is employed as a case study to investigate the distance (d)&#8208;dependent inter&#8208;metal interaction, and a newly&#160;proposed macro&#8208;descriptor is provided as the guidance for future designing DACs.








Abstract
Dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) have become an emerging platform to provide more flexible active sites for electrocatalytic reactions with multi&#8208;electron/proton transfer, such as the CO2&#160;reduction reaction (CRR). However, the introduction of asymmetric dual&#8208;atom sites causes complexity in structure, leaving an incomprehensive understanding of the inter&#8208;metal interaction and catalytic mechanism. Taking NiCu DACs as an example, herein, a more rational structural model is proposed, and the distance&#8208;dependent inter&#8208;metal interaction is investigated by combining theoretical simulations and experiments, including density functional theory computation, aberration&#8208;corrected transmission electron microscopy, synchrotron&#8208;based X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure, and Monte Carlo experiments. A distance threshold around 5.3&#160;&#197; between adjacent Ni&#63743;N4&#160;and Cu&#63743;N4&#160;moieties is revealed to trigger effective electronic regulation and boost CRR performance on both selectivity and activity. A universal macro&#8208;descriptor rigorously correlating the inter&#8208;metal distance and intrinsic material features (e.g., metal loading and thickness) is established to guide the rational design and synthesis of advanced DACs. This study highlights the significance of identifying the inter&#8208;metal interaction in DACs, and helps bridge the gap between theoretical study and experimental synthesis of atomically dispersed catalysts with highly correlated active sites.

         <title>Efficient, Color&#8208;Stable, and Long&#8208;Lived White Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Utilizing Phosphorescent Molecular Aggregates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Development of single&#8208;stack hybrid white organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (WOLEDs) uses amber&#8208;colored aggregate emission and blue fluorescence emission to achieve high efficiencies, long operational lifetimes, and excellent color stabilities under various driving conditions. As far as it is known, this is the most stable single&#8208;stack white OLED device among all reported white OLEDs on the public domain.








Abstract
Highly efficient and stable single&#8208;stack hybrid white organic light&#8208;emitting diode (WOLED) devices are developed using two emissive layers: one with amber&#8208;colored phosphorescent molecular&#8208;aggregate emission from the Pd(II) complex, Pd(II) 7&#8208;(3&#8208;(pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;yl&#8208;&#954;N)phenoxy&#8208;&#954;C)(benzo&#8208;&#954;C)([c]benzo[4,5]imidazo&#8208;&#954;N)[1,2&#8208;a][1,5]naphthyridine, Pd3O8&#8208;Py5, and the other with blue fluorescence emission. An optimized device structure achieves high color stability under various current densities, an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 45.5%, a power efficiency of 97.4 Lm W&#8722;1, and an estimated LT95 (operational time to 95% of the initial luminance) of 50 744 h at an initial luminance of 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2.

         <title>3D Printing of Electron/Ion Fluxes Dual&#8208;Gradient Anode for Dendrite&#8208;free Zinc Batteries</title>

Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) porous Zn metal anodes have aroused widespread interest in Zn ion batteries (ZIBs). Nevertheless, the notorious &#8220;top&#8208;growth&#8221; dendrite caused by the intrinsic top&#8208;concentrated ions and randomly&#8208;distributed electrons may ultimately trigger a cell failure. Herein, for the first time, an electron/ion fluxes dual&#8208;gradient 3D porous Zn anode is elaborated for dendrite&#8208;free ZIBs by adopting 3D printing technology. The 3D&#8208;printed Zn anode with layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer bottom&#8208;up attenuating Ag nanoparticles (3DP&#8208;BU@Zn) establishes dual&#8208;gradient electron/ion fluxes, i.e., an internal bottom&#8208;up gradient electron flux created by bottom&#8208;rich conductive Ag nanoparticles, and a gradient ion flux resulting from zincophilic Ag nanoparticles which pump ions toward the bottom. Meanwhile, the 3D printing technology enabled hierarchical porous structure and continuously conducting network endow unimpeded electron transfer and ion diffusion among the electrode, dominating a bottom&#8208;preferential Zn deposition behavior. As a result, the 3DP&#8208;BU@Zn symmetrical cell affords highly reversible Zn plating/stripping with an extremely small voltage hysteresis of 17.7&#160;mV and a superior lifespan over 630 hours at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 1 mAh cm&#8722;2. Meanwhile, the 3DP&#8208;BU@Zn//VO2 full cell exhibits remarkable cyclic stability over 500 cycles. This unique dual&#8208;gradient strategy sheds light on the roadmap for the next&#8208;generation safe and durable Zn metal batteries.

Abstract
A series of helically&#8208;shaped benzo[b]chryseno[4,3&#8208;d]thiophenes, naphtho[1,2&#8208;b]phenanthro[4,3&#8208;d]thiophenes and chryseno[3,4&#8208;b]naphtho[1,2&#8208;d]thiophenes are synthesized via a highly enantioselective Au&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular alkyne hydroarylation reaction. The inversion barriers of the structures obtained are determined both theoretically and experimentally, and their chiroptical properties reported. Preliminary studies on the post&#8208;synthetic functionalization of these thiahelicenes, and their transformation into azahelicenes are also presented. In addition, a straightforward one&#8208;step protocol is developed, which wraps the initially obtained chryseno[3,4&#8208;b]naphtho[1,2&#8208;d]thiophenes into bowl&#8208;shaped pleiadene derivatives without erosion of the enantiopurity. The number of structurally related products that are obtained with high enantioselectivity enables the establishment of comprehensive correlations between the structure and conformational stability or (chir)optical properties.

         <title>Blocking Spatiotemporal Crosstalk between Subcellular Organelles for Enhancing Anticancer Therapy with Nanointercepter</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The spatiotemporal characterization of signaling crosstalk between subcellular organelles is crucial for the therapeutic effect of malignant tumors. Blocking interactive crosstalk in this fashion is significant but challenging. Herein, we report a communication interception strategy, which blocks spatiotemporal crosstalk between subcellular organelles for cancer therapy with underlying molecular mechanisms. Briefly, amorphous&#8208;core@crystalline&#8208;shell Fe@Fe3O4 nanoparticles (ACFeNPs) were fabricated to specifically block the crosstalk between lysosomes and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by hydroxyl radicals generated along with their trajectory through heterogeneous Fenton reaction. ACFeNPs initially entered lysosomes and triggered autophagy, then continuous lysosomal damage blocked the generation of functional autolysosomes which mediated ER&#8208;lysosome crosstalk, thus the autophagy was paralyzed. Thereafter, released ACFeNPs from lysosomes induced ER stress. Without the alleviation by autophagy, ER stress&#8208;associated apoptotic pathway was fully activated, resulting in remarkable therapeutic effect. This strategy provides a wide venue for nanomedicine to exert biological advantages and confers new perspective for the design of novel anticancer drugs.

         <title>Fluorinated covalent organic framework with accelerated oxygen transfer nano&#8208;channels for high performance zinc&#8208;air batteries</title>

Abstract
The establishment of abundant three&#8208;phase interfaces with accelerated mass transfer in air cathodes is highly desirable for the development of high&#8208;rate and long&#8208;cycling rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs). Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) exhibits tailored nano&#8208;pore structures, facilitating the rational tuning of their specific properties. Here, by finely tuning the fluoridated nanopores of COF, we unprecedentedly designed and synthesized a novel high&#8208;performance air cathode for rechargeable ZABs. COF nanosheets were decorated with fluoridated alkyl chains, which shows high affinity to O2, in its nanopores (fluorinated COF). The fluorinated COF nanosheets are stacked into well&#8208;defined O2 transport channels, which were then assembled into aerophilic &#8220;nano&#8208;islands&#8221; on the hydrophilic FeNi layered&#8208;double&#8208;hydroxide (FeNi LDH) electro&#8208;catalyst surface. Therefore, the mass transport &#8220;highway&#8221; for O2 and water are segregated on the nanoscale, which significantly enlarges the area of three&#8208;phase boundaries and greatly promotes the mass&#8208;transfer therein. ZABs based on the COF modified air cathode deliver a small charge/discharge voltage gap (0.64&#160;V at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2), a peak power density (118&#160;mW cm&#8722;2), and a stable cyclability, far exceeding the conventional FeNi LDH air cathode. This work provides a feasible approach for the design of the air cathodes for high performance ZABs, and will expand the new application of COF.

&lt;p&gt;The establishment of abundant three-phase interfaces with accelerated mass transfer in air cathodes is highly desirable for the development of high-rate and long-cycling rechargeable zinc-air batteries (ZABs). Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) exhibits tailored nano-pore structures, facilitating the rational tuning of their specific properties.

         <title>Topological Metal MoP Nanowire for Interconnect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The increasing resistance of Cu interconnects for decreasing dimensions is a major challenge in continued downscaling of integrated circuits beyond the 7&#8208;nm technology node as it leads to unacceptable signal delays and power consumption in computing. The resistivity of Cu increases due to electron scattering at surfaces and grain boundaries of the interconnects at the nanoscale. Topological semimetals, owing to their topologically protected surface states and suppressed electron backscattering, are promising material candidates to potentially replace current Cu interconnects as low&#8208;resistance interconnects. Here, we report the unprecedented resistivity scaling of topological metal MoP nanowires and show that the resistivity values are superior to those of nanoscale Cu interconnects below 500 nm2 cross&#8208;section areas. The calculated cohesive energy of MoP suggests better stability against electromigration, enabling a barrier&#8208;free design of MoP interconnects. MoP nanowires are more resistant to surface oxidation than the 20&#8208;nm thick Cu reference. The thermal conductivity of MoP is comparable to those of Ru and Co, which are considered prominent barrier&#8208;free interconnects. Most importantly, we demonstrate that the dimensional scaling of the MoP nanowires, in terms of line resistance versus total cross&#8208;sectional area, is competitive to those of effective Cu with barrier/liner and barrier&#8208;less Ru interconnects, suggesting MoP is an attractive alternative for the current scaling challenge of Cu interconnects.

         <title>DNA Nanocluster Combined with one&#8208;shot Radiotherapy Augment Cancer Immunotherapy Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Immunotherapy show immense promise for improving cancer treatment. Combining immunotherapy with radiotherapy provides conspicuous advantage due to its enhanced abscopal effect. However, established immune tolerance mechanisms in the tumor microenvironment can hamper the generation of sufficient abscopal effect. Herein, we designed a type of DNA nanocluster (DNAnc) that was self&#8208;assembled by CpG ODNs loaded Y&#8208;shaped double stranded DNA vector based on the unique complementary base&#8208;pairing rules. The unique structure of DNAnc made it load more than about 8125.5 &#177; 822.5 copies of CpG ODNs within one single nanostructure, which effectively increased resistance to nuclease degradation and elevated the efficiency of repolarizing macrophages to a M1&#8208;like phenotype. Mechanistic studies revealed that more DNAnc were endocytosed by macrophages at the cancer tissue and repolarize macrophages to elicit a robust abscopal effect with the accumulation of macrophages induced by radiotherapy, generating potent, long&#8208;term and durable antitumor immunity for the inhibition of tumor metastasis and the prevention of tumour recurrence, which provides a novel strategy to boost cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Programmable Jigsaw Puzzles of Soft Materials Enabled by Pixelated Holographic Surface Reliefs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Manual intervention in the self&#8208;organization of soft matter to obtain a desired superstructure is a complex but significant project. Specifically, optical components made fully or partially from reconfigurable and stimuli&#8208;responsive soft materials, referred to as soft photonics, are poised to form versatile platforms in various areas; however, a limited scale, narrow spectral adaptability, and poor stability are still formidable challenges. Herein, we developed a facile way to program the optical jigsaw puzzle of nematic liquid crystals via pixelated holographic surface reliefs, leading to an era of manufacturing for programmable soft materials with tailored functions. Multiscale jigsaw puzzles are established and endowed with unprecedented stability and durability, further sketching a prospective framework towards customized adaptive photonic architectures. This work demonstrates a reliable and efficient approach for directly assembling soft matter, unlocking the long&#8208;sought full potential of stimuli&#8208;responsive soft systems and providing opportunities to inspire the next generation of soft photonics and relevant areas.

         <title>Highly Efficient and Stable FA&#8208;Based Quasi&#8208;2D Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper Perovskite Solar Cells by the Incorporation of &#946;&#8208;Fluorophenylethanamine Cations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper (2D RP) perovskite, with attractive environmental and structural stability, has shown great application in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the relatively inferior photovoltaic efficiencies of 2D PSCs limit their further application. To address this issue, &#946;&#8208;&#8203;fluorophenylethanamine (&#946;&#8208;&#8203;FPEA) as a novel spacer cation is designed and employed to develop stable and efficient quasi&#8208;2D RP PSCs. The strong dipole moment of the &#946;&#8208;&#8203;FPEA enhances the interactions between the cations and [PbI6]4&#8722; octahedra, improving the charge dissociation of quasi&#8208;2D RP perovskite. Additionally, the introduction of the &#946;&#8208;&#8203;FPEA cation optimizes the energy level alignment, improves the crystallinity, stabilizes both the mixed phase and &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 phase of the quasi&#8208;2D RP perovskite film, prolongs the carrier diffusion length, increases the carrier lifetime and decreases the trap density. By incorporating the &#946;&#8208;&#8203;FPEA, the quasi&#8208;2D RP PSCs exhibit a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.77% (versus phenylethylammonium (PEA) based quasi&#8208;2D RP PSCs of 12.81%) on PEDOT:PSS substrate and achieve a champion PCE of 19.11% on the PTAA substrate. It's worth noting that the &#946;&#8208;&#8203;FPEA&#8208;based unencapsulated quasi&#8208;2D RP PSCs exhibit significant improvements in both thermal and moisture stability. These findings provide an effective strategy for developing novel spacer cations for high&#8208;performance 2D RP PSCs.

         <title>Dynamic Reconstitution Between Copper Single atoms and Clusters for Electrocatalytic Urea synthesis</title>

Abstract
Electrocatalytic C&#8208;N coupling between carbon dioxide and nitrate emerges to meet comprehensive demands of carbon footprint closing, valorisation of waste and sustainable manufacture of urea. However, the identification of catalytic active sites and the design of efficient electrocatalysts remain a challenge. Herein, we report the synthesis of urea catalysed by copper single atoms decorated on a CeO2 support (denoted Cu1&#8208;CeO2). The catalyst exhibits an average urea yield rate of 52.84&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 gcat.&#8722;1 at &#8208;1.6&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectra demonstrate the reconstitution of copper single atoms (Cu1) to clusters (Cu4) during electrolysis. These electrochemically reconstituted Cu4 clusters are real active sites for electrocatalytic urea synthesis. Favourable C&#8208;N coupling reactions and urea formation on Cu4 are validated using operando synchrotron&#8208;radiation Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and theoretical calculations. Dynamic and reversible transformations of clusters to single&#8208;atom configurations occur when the applied potential is switched to an open&#8208;circuit potential, endowing catalyst with superior structural and electrochemical stabilities.

         <title>Piezoelectric Actuation Mechanism Involving Extrinsic Nanodomain Dynamics in Lead&#8208;Free Piezoelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The piezoelectric actuation mechanism in pseudocubic structures is clarified by the calculation of extrinsic/intrinsic contribution. Although only intrinsic contributes to the piezoelectricity, it does not match the piezoelectricity of BiFeO3&#8211;BaTiO3. It is clarified that extrinsic effect on nanodomain rearrangements is revealed in BiFeO3&#8211;BaTiO3. Extrinsic effect on nanodomain rearrangement is involved in the actuation mechanism of piezoelectricity.








Abstract
Piezoelectric materials play a key role in applications, while there are physically open questions. The physical origin of piezoelectricity is understood as the sum of contributions from intrinsic effects on lattice dynamics and those from extrinsic effects on ferroic&#8208;domain dynamics, but there is an incomplete understanding that all but intrinsic effects are classified as extrinsic effects. Therefore, the accurate classification of extrinsic effects is important for understanding&#160;the physical origin of piezoelectricity. In this work, high&#8208;energy synchrotron radiation X&#8208;ray diffraction is utilized to measure the response of BiFeO3&#8722;BaTiO3 piezoelectrics and the intrinsic/extrinsic contribution to electric fields. It is found from crystal structure and intrinsic/extrinsic contribution, using the analysis involving structure refinement with various structural model and micromechanics&#8208;based calculations, that Bi3+&#8208;ion disordering is important for realization of piezoelectricity and nanodomains. Here, an extrinsic effect on the rearrangement of nanodomains is suggested. The nanodomains, which are formed by the locally distorted structure around the A&#8208;site by Bi&#8208;ion disordering, can significantly deform the material in the BiFeO3&#8722;BaTiO3 system, which contributes to the piezoelectric actuation mechanism apart from the extrinsic effect on ferroic&#8208;domain dynamics. Bi&#8208;ion disordering plays an important role in realizing piezoelectricity and nanodomains and can provide essential material design clues to develop next&#8208;generation Bi&#8208;based lead&#8208;free piezoelectric ceramics.

         <title>Organic Synthetic Photonic Systems with Reconfigurable Parity&#8208;time Symmetry Breaking for Tunable Single&#8208;mode Microlasers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Synthetic photonic materials exploiting the quantum concept of parity&#8208;time (PT) symmetry led to an emerging photonic paradigm&#8212;non&#8208;Hermitian photonics, which is revolutionizing the photonic sciences. The non&#8208;Hermitian photonics dealing with the interplay between gain and loss in PT synthetic photonic material systems offers a versatile platform for advancing microlaser technology. However, current PT&#8208;symmetric microcavity laser systems only manipulate imaginary parts of the refractive indices, suffering from limited laser spectral bandwidth. Here we propose an organic composite material system to synthesize reconfigurable PT&#8208;symmetric microcavities with controllable complex refractive indices for realizing tunable single&#8208;mode laser outputs. A grayscale electron&#8208;beam direct writing technique is elaborately designed to process laser dye&#8208;doped polymer films in one single step into microdisk cavities with periodic gain and loss distribution, which enables thresholdless PT&#8208;symmetry breaking and single&#8208;mode laser operation. Furthermore, organic photoisomerizable compounds are introduced to reconfigure the PT&#8208;symmetric systems in real&#8208;time by tailoring the real refractive index of the polymer microresonators, allowing for dynamically and continuously tunable single&#8208;mode laser output. Our work fundamentally enhances the PT&#8208;symmetric photonic systems for innovative design of synthetic photonic materials and architectures.

         <title>Fracture Detection in Bio&#8208;Glues with Fluorescent Protein&#8208;Based Optical Force Probes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Glues are being used to bond, seal, and repair in industry and biomedicine. The improvement of gluing performance is hence important for the development of new glues with better and balanced property spaces, which in turn necessitates a mechanistic understanding of their mechanical failure. Optical force probes (OFPs) allow the observation of mechanical material damage in polymers from the macro down to the microscale, yet have never been employed in glues. Here, the development of a series of ratiometric OFPs based on fluorescent protein&#8208;dye and protein&#8208;protein conjugates and their incorporation into genetically engineered bio&#8208;glues is reported. The OFPs are designed to efficiently modulate F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) upon force application thereby reporting on force&#8208;induced molecular alterations independent of concentration and fluorescence intensity both spectrally and through their fluorescence lifetime. By fluorescence spectroscopy in solution and in the solid state and by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy, stress concentrations are visualized and adhesive and cohesive failure in the fracture zone is differentiated.

         <title>Reversible Perspiring Artificial &#8220;Fingertips&#8221;</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Fingertip perspiration is a vital process within human predation, to which our species owes its survival and its biological success. In this paper, we recreate the unique human ability of extensive perspiration and controlled friction in self&#8208;assembled cholesteric liquid crystals, mimicking the natural processes that occur in the dermis and epidermis of human skin. This is achieved by inducing porosity in our responsive, liquid&#8208;bearing material through the controlled&#8208;polymerization phase&#8208;separation process. The unique topography of human fingerprints is further emulated in our materials by balancing the parallel chirality&#8208;induced force and the perpendicular substrate&#8208;anchoring force during synthesis. As a result, our artificial fingertips are capable of secreting and re&#8208;absorbing liquid upon light illumination. By demonstrating the function of our soft material in a tribological aspect, it exhibits a controllable anti&#8208;sliding comparable to human fingertips and subsequently attains a higher degree of biomimicry. We envision this biomimetic fingertip being applied in a multitude of fields, ranging from biomedical instruments to interactive, human&#8208;like soft robotic devices.

         <title>Highly Selective On&#8208;Surface Reactions of Aryl Propiolic Acids via Decarboxylative Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Aryl propiolic acids are introduced as a new class of monomers in the field of on&#8208;surface chemistry to build up poly(arylenebutadiynylenes) through decarboxylative Glaser coupling. As compared to arylalkynes that are routinely used in the on&#8208;surface Glaser coupling, it was found that the decarboxylative coupling occurs at slightly lower temperature and with excellent selectivity. Activation occurs through decarboxylation for the propiolic acids whereas the classical Glaser coupling is achieved through alkyne C&#8722;H activation and this process shows poor selectivity. The efficiency of the decarboxylative coupling was documented by successful polymerization of bis(alkynylpropiolic acids) as monomers. It was also found that the new activation mode is compatible with aryl bromide functionalities which allows the formation of unsymmetric metal&#8208;organic polymers on surface by chemoselective sequential reactions. All transformations were analyzed by a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) and were further studied by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

         <title>Dressing Bacteria With a Hybrid Immunoactive Nanosurface to Elicit Dual Anticancer and Antiviral Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Approaches capable of simultaneously treating cancer and protecting susceptible patients from lethal infections, such as coronavirus disease 2019, are highly desirable but prove to be difficult. Here, dressing bacteria with a combination of a checkpoint blocking antibody and a virus&#8208;specific antigen is reported to elicit dual anticancer and antiviral immunity.








Abstract
Approaches capable of simultaneously treating cancer and protecting susceptible patients from lethal infections such as coronavirus disease 2019, are highly desirable but prove to be difficult. Here, dressing bacteria with a hybrid immunoactive nanosurface is reported to elicit dual anticancer and antiviral immunity. A combination of a checkpoint blocking antibody and a virus&#8208;specific antigen is covalently conjugated to polydopamine nanoparticles, which can be anchored onto bacterial surface, by a one&#8208;step in situ polymerization of dopamine under a cell&#8208;friendly condition. By virtue of the ability to colonize and penetrate deep tumor tissue, dressed bacteria enable sustained release and expanded exposure of carried immunoactivators to stimulate immune cells. In addition to a carrier role, bacteria are able to further provoke innate immunity due to the native immunogenicity of the pathogen&#8208;associated molecular patterns. Immunization with dressed bacteria promotes the maturation, and activation of antigen&#8208;presenting cells, which induces robust humoral and cellular immune responses in tumor&#8208;bearing mice. As evidenced by efficient production of viral&#8208;antigen&#8208;specific immunoglobulin G antibody in serum and significantly suppressed tumor growth in different models, dressing bacteria with a hybrid immunoactive nanosurface paves an avenue to prepare next&#8208;generation therapeutics for synergistic treatment and prevention.

         <title>Terminal Atom&#8208;Controlled Etching of 2D&#8208;TMDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The controlled etching of two&#8208;dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (2D&#8208;TMDs) is critical to understanding the growth mechanisms of 2D materials and patterning 2D materials but remains a major comprehensive challenge. Here, we report a rational strategy to control the terminal atoms of 2D&#8208;TMDs etched holes. Using laser irradiation combined with an improved anisotropic thermal etching process under a determined atmosphere, we created terminal atom&#8208;controlled etched hole arrays on 2D&#8208;TMDs. By adjusting the gas atmosphere during the thermal etching stage, triangular etched hole arrays terminated by the W&#8208;ZZ edge (in an Ar/H2 atmosphere), hexagonal etched hole arrays terminated alternately by the W&#8208;ZZ edge and S&#8208;ZZ (Se&#8208;ZZ) edge (in a pure Ar atmosphere) and triangular etched hole arrays terminated by the S&#8208;ZZ (Se&#8208;ZZ) edge (in an Ar/sulfur (selenium) vapor atmosphere) can be obtained. Density functional theory (DFT) reveals the forming energy of different edges and the different activities of metal atoms and chalcogenide atoms under different atmospheres, which determine the terminal atoms of the holes. This work may enhance our understanding of the etching and growth of 2D&#8208;TMDs. The 2D&#8208;TMDs hole arrays constructed by this work may have important applications in catalysis, nonlinear optics, spintronics and large&#8208;scale integrated circuits.

         <title>Planted Graphene Quantum Dots for Targeted, Enhanced Tumor Imaging and Long&#8208;term Visualization of Local Pharmacokinetics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
While photoluminescent graphene quantum dots (GQDs) have long been considered very suitable for bioimaging owing to their protein&#8208;like size, super&#8208;high photostability and in vivo long&#8208;term biosafety, their unique and crucial bioimaging applications in vivo remain unreachable. Herein, we present planted GQDs as an excellent tool for in vivo fluorescent sustainable and multimodality tumor bioimaging in various scenarios. The GQDs were in situ planted in the PEG layer of PEGylated nanoparticles via a bottom&#8208;up molecular approach to obtain the NPs&#8208;GQDs&#8208;PEG nanocomposite. The planted GQDs show more than 4 times prolonged blood circulation and 7&#8764;8 times increased tumor accumulation than typical GQDs in vivo. After accessible specificity modification, the multifunctional NPs&#8208;GQDs&#8208;PEG provides targeted, multimodal molecular imaging for various tumor models in vitro or in vivo. Moreover, the highly photostable GQDs enable long&#8208;term, real&#8208;time visualization of the local pharmacokinetics of NPs in vivo. Planting GQDs in PEGylated nanomedicine offers a new strategy for broad in vivo biomedical applications of GQDs.

Abstract
Light&#8208;intensity selective superlinear photodetectors with ultralow dark current can provide an essential breakthrough for the development of high&#8208;performing near&#8208;sensor vision processing. However, the development of near&#8208;sensor vision processing is not only conceptually important for device operation (given that sensors naturally exhibit linear/sublinear responses), but also essential to get rid of the massive amount of data generated during object sensing and classification with noisy inputs. Therefore, achieving the giant superlinear photoresponse while maintaining the picoampere leakage current, irrespective of the measurement bias, is one of the most challenging tasks. Here, we developed Mott material (vanadium dioxide) and silicon&#8208;based integrated infrared photodetectors that show giant superlinear photoresponse (exponent &gt;18) and ultralow dark current of 4.46 pA. Specifically, the device demonstrates an electro&#8208;opto&#8208;coupled insulator&#8208;to&#8208;metal transition, which leads to outstanding photocurrent on/off ratio (&gt;106), a high responsivity (&gt; 1&#160;mA/W), and excellent detectivity (&gt;1012 Jones), while maintaining response speed (&#964;r = 6 &#956;s and &#964;f = 10 &#956;s). Further, we demonstrate intensity&#8208;selective near&#8208;sensor processing and exhibit night vision pattern reorganization even with noisy inputs. This research will pave the way for the creation of high&#8208;performance photodetectors with potential uses, such as in night vision, pattern recognition, and neuromorphic processing.

         <title>Rapid and Direct Liquid&#8208;Phase Synthesis of Luminescent Metal Halide Superlattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The crystallisation of nanocrystal building blocks into artificial superlattices has emerged as an efficient approach for tailoring the nanoscale properties and functionalities of novel devices. To date, ordered arrays of colloidal metal halide nanocrystals have mainly been achieved by using post&#8208;synthetic strategies. Here, we present a rapid and direct liquid&#8208;phase synthesis to achieve a highly robust crystallisation of luminescent metal halide nanocrystals into perfect face&#8208;centred&#8208;cubic (FCC) superlattices on the micron scale. We observe the continuous growth of individual nanocrystals within the superlattice, followed by the disassembly of the superlattices into individually dispersed nanocrystals owing to the highly repulsive interparticle interactions induced by large nanocrystals. Transmission electron microscopy characterisation reveals that owing to an increase in solvent entropy, the structure of the superlattices transforms from FCC to hexagonal close&#8208;packed (HCP) and the nanocrystals disassemble. The FCC superlattice exhibits a single and slightly redshifted emission, due to the reabsorption&#8208;free property of the building block units. Compared to individual nanocrystals, the superlattices have three times higher quantum yield with improved environmental stability, making them ideal for use as ultrabright blue&#8208;light emitters. This study is expected to facilitate the creation of metamaterials with ordered nanocrystal structures and their practical applications.

         <title>Stretchable Electrodes Based on Over&#8208;Layered Liquid Metal Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fabrication of thin films with liquid metal is proposed using thermal evaporation. The oxide film on the liquid metal surface forms a unique structure as indium/oxide/gallium (InOG). The oxide film helps form conductivity and exhibits negative piezoresistivity by rupturing. InOG electrode exhibits controllable electrical properties and mechanical stability. InOG overcomes the limitations of conventional applications through unique properties.








Abstract
Liquid metals are attractive materials for stretchable electronics owing to their high electrical conductivity and near&#8208;zero Young's modulus.

&lt;p&gt;The fabrication of thin films with liquid metal is proposed using thermal evaporation. The oxide film on the liquid metal surface forms a unique structure as indium/oxide/gallium (InOG). The oxide film helps form conductivity and exhibits negative piezoresistivity by rupturing. InOG electrode exhibits controllable electrical properties and mechanical stability. InOG overcomes the limitations of conventional applications through unique properties.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liquid metals are attractive materials for stretchable electronics owing to their high electrical conductivity and near-zero Young's modulus. However, the high surface tension of liquid metals makes it difficult to form films. A novel stretchable film is proposed based on an over-layered liquid-metal network. An intentionally oxidized interfacial layer helps to construct uninterrupted indium and gallium nanoclusters and produces additional electrical pathways between the two metal networks under mechanical deformation. The films exhibit gigantic negative piezoresistivity (G-NPR), which decreased the resistance up to 85% during the first 50% stretching. This G-NPR property is due to the rupture of the metal oxides, which allows the formation of liquid eutectic gallium-indium (EGaIn) and the connection of the over-layered networks to build new electrical paths. The electrodes exhibiting G-NPR are complementarily combined with conventional electrodes to amplify their performance or achieve some unique operations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mitochondrial&#8208;Targeted Delivery of Polyphenol&#8208;Mediated Antioxidases Complexes against Pyroptosis and Inflammatory Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyphenols such as tannic acid (TA) are able to mediate the targeting of polyphenol/antioxidases complexes to mitochondria, stemming from the strong binding of TA to mitochondrial outer membrane proteins. Superoxide dismutase, catalase, and TA are assembled into complexes for efficiently scavenging excess mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and reversing mitochondrial depolarization, thereby inhibiting inflammasome&#8208;mediated pyroptosis and alleviate pyroptosis&#8208;related hepatitis.








Abstract
Excess accumulation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) is a key target for inhibiting pyroptosis&#8208;induced inflammation and tissue damage. However, targeted delivery of drugs to mitochondria and efficient clearance of mtROS remain challenging. In current study, it is discovered that polyphenols such as tannic acid (TA) can mediate the targeting of polyphenol/antioxidases complexes to mitochondria. This affinity does not depend on mitochondrial membrane potential but stems from the strong binding of TA to mitochondrial outer membrane proteins. Taking advantage of the feasibility of self&#8208;assembly between TA and proteins, superoxide dismutase, catalase, and TA are assembled into complexes (referred to as TSC) for efficient enzymatic activity maintenance. In vitro fluorescence confocal imaging shows that TSC not only promoted the uptake of biological enzymes in hepatocytes but also highly overlapped with mitochondria after lysosomal escape. The results from an in vitro model of hepatocyte oxidative stress demonstrate that TSC efficiently scavenges excess mtROS and reverses mitochondrial depolarization, thereby inhibiting inflammasome&#8208;mediated pyroptosis. More interestingly, TSC maintain superior efficacy compared with the clinical gold standard drug N&#8208;acetylcysteine in both acetaminophen&#8208; and D&#8208;galactosamine/lipopolysaccharide&#8208;induced pyroptosis&#8208;related hepatitis mouse models. In conclusion, this study opens a new paradigm for targeting mitochondrial oxidative stress to inhibit pyroptosis and treat inflammatory diseases.

         <title>Ion&#8208;Selective Microporous Polymer Membranes with Hydrogen&#8208;Bond and Salt&#8208;Bridge Networks for Aqueous Organic Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance ion&#8208;selective polymer membranes are fabricated from blends of carboxylate&#8208; and amidoxime&#8208;functionalized polymers of intrinsic microporosity by exploiting inter&#8208;/intrachain hydrogen&#8208;bond and salt&#8208;bridge interactions. They demonstrate fast ion conduction with low crossover of redox&#8208;active molecules, enabling improved power rating and stable cycling performance in aqueous organic redox flow batteries.








Abstract
Redox flow batteries (RFBs) have great potential for long&#8208;duration grid&#8208;scale energy storage. Ion&#8208;conducting membranes are a crucial component in RFBs, allowing charge&#8208;carrying ions to transport while preventing the cross&#8208;mixing of redox couples. Commercial Nafion membranes are widely used in RFBs, but their unsatisfactory ionic and molecular selectivity, as well as high costs, limit the performance and the widespread deployment of this technology. To extend the longevity and reduce the cost of RFB systems, inexpensive ion&#8208;selective membranes that concurrently deliver low ionic resistance and high selectivity toward redox&#8208;active species are highly desired. Here, high&#8208;performance RFB membranes are fabricated from blends of carboxylate&#8208; and amidoxime&#8208;functionalized polymers of intrinsic microporosity, which exploit the beneficial properties of both polymers. The enthalpy&#8208;driven formation of cohesive interchain interactions, including hydrogen bonds and salt bridges, facilitates the microscopic miscibility of the blends, while ionizable functional groups within the sub&#8208;nanometer pores allow optimization of membrane ion&#8208;transport functions. The resulting microporous membranes demonstrate fast cation conduction with low crossover of redox&#8208;active molecular species, enabling improved power ratings and reduced capacity fade in aqueous RFBs using anthraquinone and ferrocyanide as redox couples.

         <title>Printing on Particles: Combining Two&#8208;Photon Nanolithography and Capillary Assembly to Fabricate Multimaterial Microstructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of the capillary assembly of colloidal particles and two&#8208;photon polymerization nanoprinting allows the easy integration of multiple functional materials into complex 1D, 2D, and 3D&#8208;microstructures. This flexible method enables the fabrication of wide range of microscale devices, from thermoresponsive microactuators, to magnetically controlled &#8220;micromachines,&#8221; which can selectively capture and release particles in solution.








Abstract
Additive manufacturing at the micro&#8208; and nanoscale has seen a recent upsurge to suit an increasing demand for more elaborate structures. However, the integration of multiple distinct materials at small scales remains challenging. To this end, capillarity&#8208;assisted particle assembly (CAPA) and two&#8208;photon polymerization direct laser writing (2PP&#8208;DLW) are combined to realize a new class of multimaterial microstructures. 2PP&#8208;DLW and CAPA both are used to fabricate 3D templates to guide the CAPA of soft&#8208; and hard colloids, and to link well&#8208;defined arrangements of functional microparticle arrays produced by CAPA, a process that is termed &#8220;printing on particles.&#8221; The printing process uses automated particle recognition algorithms to connect colloids into 1D, 2D, and 3D tailored structures, via rigid, soft, or responsive polymer links. Once printed and developed, the structures can be easily re&#8208;dispersed in water. Particle clusters and lattices of varying symmetry and composition are reported, together with thermoresponsive microactuators, and magnetically driven &#8220;micromachines&#8221;, which can efficiently move, capture, and release DNA&#8208;coated particles in solution. The flexibility of this method allows the combination of a wide range of functional materials into complex structures, which will boost the realization of new systems and devices for numerous fields, including microrobotics, micromanipulation, and metamaterials.

         <title>From Heterostructures to Solid&#8208;Solutions: Structural Tunability in Mixed Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The degree of ion mixing in multicomponent perovskite crystals is a key factor for the stability and performance of optoelectronic devices but remains challenging to control. In this work, a new method, termed evaporation&#8211;crystallization polymer pen lithography, is used to synthesize and systematically study libraries of halide perovskite crystals (Cs1&#8722;xFAxPbX3, where X = halide anion) and reveals strategies for deliberately controlling ion segregation behavior in these materials.








Abstract
The stability, reliability, and performance of halide&#8208;perovskite&#8208;based devices depend upon the structure, composition, and particle size of the device&#8208;enabling materials. Indeed, the degree of ion mixing in multicomponent perovskite crystals, although challenging to control, is a key factor in determining properties. Herein, an emerging method termed evaporation&#8211;crystallization polymer pen lithography is used to synthesize and systematically study the degree of ionic mixing of Cs0.5FA0.5PbX3 (FA = formamidinium; X = halide anion, ABX3) crystals, as a function of size, temperature, and composition. These experiments have led to the discovery of a heterostructure morphology where the A&#8208;site cations, Cs and FA, are segregated into the core and edge layers, respectively. Simulation and experimental results indicate that the heterostructures form as a consequence of a combination of both differences in solubility of the two ions in solution and the enthalpic preference for Cs&#8211;FA ion segregation. This preference for segregation can be overcome to form a solid&#8208;solution by decreasing crystal size (&lt;60&#160;nm) or increasing temperature. Finally, these tools are utilized to identify and synthesize solid&#8208;solution nanocrystals of Cs0.5FA0.5Pb(Br/I)3 that significantly suppress photoinduced anion migration compared to their bulk counterparts, offering a route to deliberately designed photostable optoelectronic materials.

         <title>A Highly Active, Long&#8208;Lived Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalyst Derived from Open&#8208;Framework Iridates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Open&#8208;framework iridate is employed as a pre&#8208;electrocatalyst for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The structure undergoes an unusual crystalline&#8208;to&#8208;crystalline phase transition during OER, with ultrasmall, (200) crystal plane&#8208;oriented rutile nanocrystallites as final active phase. The resulting nanocatalyst affords high activity, while remaining greatly stable for beyond 1000 h.








Abstract
The acidic oxygen evolution reaction underpins several important electrical&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversions, and this energy&#8208;intensive process relies industrially on iridium&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Here, phase&#8208;selective synthesis of metastable strontium iridates with open&#8208;framework structure and their unexpected transformation into a highly active, ultrastable oxygen evolution nano&#8208;electrocatalyst are presented. This transformation involves two major steps: Sr2+/H+ ion exchange in acid and in situ structural rearrangement under electrocatalysis conditions. Unlike its dense perovskite&#8208;structured polymorphs, the open&#8208;framework iridates have the ability to undergo rapid proton exchange in acid without framework amorphization. The resulting protonated iridates further reconstruct into ultrasmall, surface&#8208;hydroxylated, (200) crystal plane&#8208;oriented rutile nanocatalyst, instead of the common amorphous IrOxHy phase, during acidic oxygen evolution. Such microstructural characteristics are found to benefit both the oxidation of hydroxyls and the formation of O&#63743;O bonds in electrocatalytic cycle. As a result, the open&#8208;framework iridate derived nanocatalyst gives a comparable catalytic activity to the most active iridium&#8208;based oxygen evolution electrocatalysts in acid, and retains its catalytic activity for more than 1000&#160;h.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Engineering&#8208;Stabilized AgSbTe2 with High Thermoelectric Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
p&#8208;Type AgSbTe2 materials stabilized with S and Se co&#8208;doping are demonstrated to exhibit an outstanding thermoelectric (TE) figure of merit zTmax of 2.3 and a unicouple device reaching energy conversion efficiencies up to 12.3% at a temperature difference of 370 K. This exceptional performance arises from an enhanced carrier density resulting from a higher concentration of silver vacancies, a vastly improved Seebeck coefficient enabled by the flattening of the valence band maximum and the inhibited formation of n&#8208;type Ag2Te.








Abstract
Thermoelectric (TE) generators enable the direct and reversible conversion between heat and electricity, providing applications in both refrigeration and power generation. In the last decade, several TE materials with relatively high figures of merit (zT) have been reported in the low&#8208; and high&#8208;temperature regimes. However, there is an urgent demand for high&#8208;performance TE materials working in the mid&#8208;temperature range (400&#8211;700 K). Herein, p&#8208;type AgSbTe2 materials stabilized with S and Se co&#8208;doping are demonstrated to exhibit an outstanding maximum figure of merit (zTmax) of 2.3 at 673 K and an average figure of merit (zTave) of 1.59 over the wide temperature range of 300&#8211;673 K. This exceptional performance arises from an enhanced carrier density resulting from a higher concentration of silver vacancies, a vastly improved Seebeck coefficient enabled by the flattening of the valence band maximum&#160;and the inhibited formation of n&#8208;type Ag2Te, and ahighly improved stability beyond 673 K. The optimized material is used to fabricate a single&#8208;leg device with efficiencies up to 13.3% and a unicouple TE device reaching energy conversion efficiencies up to 12.3% at a temperature difference of 370 K. These results highlight an effective strategy to engineer high&#8208;performance TE material in the mid&#8208;temperature range.

         <title>Hybridization Engineering of Oxyfluoride Aluminosilicate Glass for Construction of Dual&#8208;Phase Optical Ceramics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild strategy for constructing dual&#8208;phase optical ceramics and ceramics with fiber geometry by stepped dual&#8208;phase crystallization of hybridized glass is proposed. The strategy has excellent generality, and candidates with various chemical compositions, phase combinations, and morphologies are produced. They have practical applications in lighting and X&#8208;ray imaging. These findings expand the scope of optical ceramics.








Abstract
The construction of transparent ceramics under mild conditionsand standard atmospheric pressure has great scientific and technological potential; however, it remains difficult to achieve when conventional ceramic sintering techniques are used. Herein, a mild strategy for constructing dual&#8208;phase optical ceramics with high crystallinity (&gt;90%) based on the stepped dual&#8208;phase crystallization of hybridized aluminosilicate glass is presented. Theoretical and experimental studies reveal that the hybridization of the glass system enables a new balance between the glass&#8208;forming ability and crystallization and can overcome the uncontrolled devitrification phenomenon during the dense crystallization of glass. Transparent hybridized oxide&#8208;fluoride ceramics with fiber geometry and dual&#8208;phase microstructures are also successfully fabricated. The generality of the strategy is confirmed, and transparent ceramics with various chemical compositions and phase combinations are prepared. Additionally, the cross&#8208;section of the ceramic fibers can be easily tuned into a circle, square, trapezoid, or even a triangle. Furthermore, the practical applications of optical ceramics for lighting and X&#8208;ray imaging are demonstrated. The findings described here suggest a major step toward expanding the scope of optical ceramics.

         <title>Low&#8208;Coordination Trimetallic PtFeCo Nanosaws for Practical Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing highly efficient electrocatalysts with well&#8208;controlled nanostructure is significant for realizing the practical applications of fuel cells. In&#160;this&#160;work,&#160;a&#160;novel trimetallic platinum&#8211;iron&#8211;cobalt Pt3FeCo nanosaw with abundant defects and high&#8208;index edges&#160;is&#160;synthesized, reaching superior oxygen reduction reaction kinetics and fuel cell performances than commercial Pt/C. This work offers great inspiration for developing Pt&#8208;based multimetallic nanocatalysts in the future.








Abstract
Developing high&#8208;performance catalysts for fuel cell catalysis is the most critical and challenging step for the commercialization of fuel cell technology. Here 1D&#160;trimetallic platinum&#8211;iron&#8211;cobalt nanosaws (Pt3FeCo NSs) with low&#8208;coordination features are designed as efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for practical fuel cell catalysis. The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of Pt3FeCo NSs (10.62&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 4.66 A mg&#8722;1Pt at 0.90&#160;V) is more than 25&#8208;folds higher than that of the commercial Pt/C, even after 30&#160;000 voltage cycles. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the strong inter&#8208;d&#8208;orbital electron transfer minimizes the ORR barrier with higher selectivity at robust valence states. The volcano correlation between the intrinsic structure featured with low&#8208;coordination Pt&#8208;sites and corresponding electronic activities is discovered, which guarantees high ORR activities. The Pt3FeCo NSs located in the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) also achieve very high peak power density (1800.6&#160;mW cm&#8722;2) and competitive specific/mass activities (1.79&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 0.79 A mg&#8722;1Pt at 0.90 ViR&#8208;free cell voltage) as well as a long&#8208;term lifetime in specific H2&#63743;O2 medium for proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cells, ranking top electrocatalysts reported to date for MEA. This work represents a class of multimetallic Pt&#8208;based nanocatalysts for practical fuel cells and beyond.

         <dc:description>
A new methodology to analyze the kinetics that determine the light emission in voltage&#8208;driven devices is presented. It consists of combining the voltage&#8208;modulated light emission with impedance spectroscopy, whose spectra are interpreted according to the described equivalent circuit. This method, which is unprecedently applied to perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes with high radiative efficiency, reveals electronic steps that delay the radiative event.








Abstract
The kinetics of light emission in halide perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) and solar cells is composed of a radiative recombination of voltage&#8208;injected carriers mediated by additional steps such as carrier trapping, redistribution of injected carriers, and photon recycling that affect the observed luminescence decays. These processes are investigated in high&#8208;performance halide perovskite LEDs, with external quantum efficiency (EQE) and luminance values higher than 20% and 80&#160;000 Cd m&#8722;2, by measuring the frequency&#8208;resolved emitted light with respect to modulated voltage through a new methodology termed light emission voltage modulated spectroscopy (LEVS). The spectra are shown to provide detailed information on at least three different characteristic times. Essentially, new information is obtained with respect to the electrical method of impedance spectroscopy (IS), and overall, LEVS shows promise to capture internal kinetics that are difficult to be discerned by other techniques.

         <title>Biohybrid 3D Printing of a Tissue&#8208;Sensor Platform for Wireless, Real&#8208;Time, and Continuous Monitoring of Drug&#8208;Induced Cardiotoxicity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biohybrid 3D printing method is introduced for the fabrication of tissue&#8208;sensor platforms. The integration of electronics with living cardiac tissues enables continuous monitoring of their contractile force and, ultimately, the drug&#8208;induced cardiotoxicity effects on cardiac tissues. It is expected that this method&#160;has the potential to become the next&#8208;generation technology in the field of tissue engineering for drug development.








Abstract
Drug&#8208;induced cardiotoxicity is regarded as a major hurdle in the early stages of drug development. Although there are various methods for preclinical cardiotoxicity tests, they cannot completely predict the cardiotoxic potential of a compound due to the lack of physiological relevance. Recently, 3D engineered heart tissue (EHT) has been used to investigate cardiac muscle functions as well as pharmacological effects by exhibiting physiological auxotonic contractions. However, there is still no adequate platform for continuous monitoring to test acute and chronic pharmacological effects in vitro. Here, a biohybrid 3D printing method for fabricating a tissue&#8208;sensor platform, composed of a bipillar&#8208;grafted strain gauge sensor and EHT, is first introduced. Two pillars are three&#8208;dimensionally printed as grafts onto a strain gauge&#8208;embedded substrate to promote the EHT contractility and guide the self&#8208;assembly of the EHTs along with the strain gauge. In addition, the integration of a wireless multi&#8208;channel electronic system allows for continuous monitoring of the EHT contractile force by the tissue&#8208;sensor platform and, ultimately, for the observation of the acute and chronic drug effects of cardiotoxicants. In summary, biohybrid 3D printing technology is expected to be a potential fabrication method to provide a next&#8208;generation tissue&#8208;sensor platform for an effective drug development process.

         <title>Engineering and Development of a Tissue Model for the Evaluation of Microneedle Penetration Ability, Drug Diffusion, Photothermal Activity, and Ultrasound Imaging: A Promising Surrogate to ex vivo and in vivo Tissues</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Driven by regulatory authorities and the ever&#8208;growing demands from industry, various artificial tissue models have been developed. Nevertheless, there is no model to date that is capable of mimicking the biomechanical properties of the skin whilst exhibiting the hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity properties of the skin layers. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, Makvandi and colleagues fabricated tissue surrogates based on gel and silicone for evaluation of microneedle penetration, drug diffusion, photothermal activity, and ultrasound bioimaging. The silicone layer aims to imitate the stratum corneum while the gel layer aims to mimic water&#8208;rich viable epidermis and dermis present in vivo tissues. We assessed the diffusion of drugs across the tissue model, and the results revealed that our proposed tissue model showed similar behavior to a cancerous kidney. In place of typical in vitro aqueous solutions, this model can also be employed for evaluating the photoactivity of a photothermal agent (e.g., polydopamine) since the tissue model showed a similar heating profile to mice skin when irradiated with near&#8208;infrared (NIR) laser. In addition, the designed tissue model exhibited promising results for biomedical applications in optical coherence tomography and ultrasound imaging. Such a tissue model paves the way to reduce the use of animals testing in research whilst obviating ethical concerns.

         <title>Heteroepitaxial Control of Fermi Liquid, Hund Metal, and Mott Insulator Phases in Single&#8208;Atomic&#8208;Layer Ruthenates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Interfaces between dissimilar correlated oxides can offer devices with versatile functionalities, and great efforts have been made to manipulate interfacial electronic phases. However, realizing such phases is often hampered by the inability to directly access the electronic structure information; most correlated interfacial phenomena appear within a few atomic layers from the interface. Here, we utilize atomic&#8208;scale epitaxy and photoemission spectroscopy to realize the interface control of correlated electronic phases in atomic&#8208;scale ruthenate&#8211;titanate heterostructures. While bulk SrRuO3 is a ferromagnetic metal, the heterointerfaces exclusively generate three distinct correlated phases in the single&#8208;atomic&#8208;layer limit. Our theoretical analysis reveals that atomic&#8208;scale structural proximity effects yield Fermi liquid, Hund metal, and Mott insulator phases in the quantum&#8208;confined SrRuO3. These results highlight the extensive interfacial tunability of electronic phases, hitherto hidden in the atomically thin correlated heterostructure. Moreover, our experimental platform suggests a way to control interfacial electronic phases of various correlated materials.

         <title>Dynamic and Reversible Decoration of DNA&#8208;Based Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
We demonstrate here an approach to achieve dynamic and reversible decoration of DNA&#8208;based scaffolds. To do this, we employ rationally engineered DNA tiles containing enzyme&#8208;responsive strands covalently conjugated to different molecular labels. These strands are designed to be recognized and degraded by specific enzymes (i.e., Ribonuclease H, RNase H or Uracil DNA Glycosylase, UDG) inducing their spontaneous de&#8208;hybridization from the assembled tile and replacement by a new strand conjugated to a different label. Multiple enzyme&#8208;responsive strands that specifically respond to different enzymes allow for dynamic, orthogonal, and reversible decoration of the DNA structures. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle of our strategy, we demonstrate the possibility to orthogonally control the distribution of different labels (i.e., fluorophores and small molecules) on the same scaffold without crosstalk. By doing so we obtain DNA scaffolds that display different antibodies recognition patterns. Our approach offers the possibility to control the decoration of higher&#8208;order supramolecular assemblies (including origami) with several functional moieties to achieve functional biomaterials with improved adaptability, precision, and sensing capabilities.

         <title>Hexaindium Heptasulfide/Nitrogen and Sulfur Co&#8208;doped Carbon Hollow Microspindles with Ultrahigh&#8208;Rate Sodium Storage Through the Stable Conversion and Alloying Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Group IIIA&#8208;VA metal sulfides (GMSs) have attracted an increasing attention because of their unique Na&#8208;storage mechanisms through combined conversion and alloying reactions, thus delivering large theoretical capacities and low working potentials. However, Na+ diffusion within GMSs anodes leads to severe volume change, generally representing a fundamental limitation to rate capability and cycling stability. Here, monodispersed In6S7/nitrogen and sulfur co&#8208;doped carbon hollow microspindles (In6S7/NSC HMS) assembled by N/S co&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;coated In6S7 ultrafine nanoparticles are produced by morphology&#8208;preserved thermal sulfurization of spindle&#8208;like and porous indium&#8208;based metal organic frameworks. The resulting In6S7/NSC HMS anode exhibits theoretical&#8208;value&#8208;close specific capacity (546.2 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1), ultrahigh rate capability (267.5 mAh g&#8722;1 at 30.0 A g&#8722;1), high initial coulombic efficiency (&#8764;93.5%), and &#8764;92.6% capacity retention after 4,000 cycles. This kinetically favored In6S7/NSC HMS anode fills up the kinetics gap with capacitive porous carbon cathode, enabling a sodium&#8208;ion capacitor to deliver an ultrahigh energy density of 136.3 Wh kg&#8722;1 and a maximum power density of 47.5 kW kg&#8722;1. The in&#8208;situ/ex&#8208;situ analytical techniques and theoretical calculation both show that the robust and fast Na+ charge storage of In6S7/NSC HMS arises from multi&#8208;electron redox mechanism, buffered volume expansion, negligible morphological change, and surface&#8208;controlled solid&#8208;state Na+ transport.

Here, monodispersed In&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;/nitrogen and sulfur co-doped carbon hollow microspindles (In&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;/NSC HMS) assembled by N/S co-doped carbon-coated In&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; ultrafine nanoparticles are produced by morphology-preserved thermal sulfurization of spindle-like and porous indium-based metal organic frameworks. The resulting In&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;/NSC HMS anode exhibits theoretical-value-close specific capacity (546.2 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.1 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), ultrahigh rate capability (267.5 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 30.0 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), high initial coulombic efficiency (&#8764;93.5%), and &#8764;92.6% capacity retention after 4,000 cycles. This kinetically favored In&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;/NSC HMS anode fills up the kinetics gap with capacitive porous carbon cathode, enabling a sodium-ion capacitor to deliver an ultrahigh energy density of 136.3 Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a maximum power density of 47.5 kW kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The in-situ/ex-situ analytical techniques and theoretical calculation both show that the robust and fast Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; charge storage of In&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;/NSC HMS arises from multi-electron redox mechanism, buffered volume expansion, negligible morphological change, and surface-controlled solid-state Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Dynamically interfacial pH&#8208;buffering effect enabled by N&#8208;methylimidazole molecules as spontaneous proton pumps toward highly reversible zinc metal anodes</title>

Abstract
Aqueous zinc metal batteries have attracted extensive attention due to their outstanding merits of high safety and low cost. However, the intrinsic thermodynamic instability of zinc in aqueous electrolyte inevitably results in hydrogen evolution, and the consequent generation of OH&#8722; at the interface will dramatically exacerbate the formation of dead zinc and dendrites. Herein, a dynamically interfacial pH&#8208;buffering strategy implemented by N&#8208;methylimidazole (NMI) additive is proposed to remove the detrimental OH&#8722; at zinc/electrolyte interface in real&#8208;time, thus eliminating the accumulation of by&#8208;products fundamentally. Electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance and molecular dynamics simulation results reveal the existence of interfacial absorption layer assembled by NMI and protonated NMI (NMIH+), which act as ion pumps for replenishing the interface with protons constantly. Moreover, an in&#8208;situ interfacial pH detection method with micro&#8208;sized spatial resolution based on the ultramicroelectrode technology is developed to probe the pH evolution in diffusion layer, confirming the stabilized interfacial chemical environment in NMI&#8208;containing electrolyte. Accordingly, with the existence of NMI, an excellent cumulative plating capacity of 4.2 Ah cm&#8722;2 and ultrahigh Coulombic efficiency of 99.74% are realized for zinc electrodes. Meanwhile, the NMI/NMIH+ buffer additive can accelerate the dissolution/deposition process of MnO2/Mn2+ on the cathode, leading to the enhanced cycling capacity.

         <title>Therapeutic DNAzymes: From Structure Design to Clinical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Therapeutic DNAzymes have unceasingly intrigued the scientific community owing to their prosperous gene regulation capability. The efficacy of DNAzymes against many types of diseases has been extensively studied for over two decades. However, the high expectations for DNAzymes are still not translated to the clinic because of their low effectiveness in vivo. Over the last five years, several aspects have been considered to optimize DNAzyme&#8208;integrated therapeutics, including structural stability, mechanism exploration, cell internalization rate, cofactor activation, and off&#8208;target effects. Hence, this review first discusses the early monotherapy and structural design of DNAzymes. Subsequently, the latest modes of action are reviewed, followed by an elaboration on structural stabilization strategies considering the catalytic core and substrate&#8208;binding arms. DNAzyme&#8208;based synergistic therapy is then examined, highlighting responsive carrier construction, synergistic effects, the latest discovered advanced functions, and off&#8208;target concerns. Beyond this, key clinical advances in DNAzyme&#8208;based therapy are elucidated by showcasing clinical progress. Finally, future trends and development challenges for DNAzyme&#8208;powered therapeutics in the coming years are discussed in detail.

         <title>Non&#8208;swelling Hydrogel with Regenerable High Wet Tissue Adhesion for Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Reducing the swelling of tissue&#8208;adhesive hydrogels is crucial for maintaining stable tissue adhesion and inhibiting tissue inflammation. However, reported strategies for reducing swelling always result in a simultaneous decrease in the tissue adhesive strength of the hydrogel. Furthermore, once the covalent bond breaks in the currently reported hydrogel, they cannot be rebuilt, and the hydrogel loses its tissue adhesive ability. Here, a nonswelling hydrogel (PAACP) possessing regenerable high tissue adhesion was synthesized by copolymerizing and crosslinking polyvinyl butyral with acrylic acid, gelatin, and chitosan&#8208;grafted N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;L&#8208;cysteine. The tissue adhesive strength of the obtained PAACP reaches 211.4&#160;kPa which is approximately ten times higher than that of the reported nonswelling hydrogels, and the hydrogel could be reused for multiple cycles. The as&#8208;prepared hydrogel showed great potential in soft bioelectronics, as muscle fatigue was successfully monitored via the electrode array and strain sensor integrated on PAACP substrates. The success of these bioelectronics offers potential applicability in the long&#8208;term diagnosis of muscle&#8208;related health conditions and prosthetic manipulations.

         <title>Butterfly&#8208;Inspired Tri&#8208;State Photonic Crystal Composite Film for Multilevel Information Encryption and Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Counterfeiting is a worldwide issue and has long troubled legitimate businesses, while the nowadays anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials and technology are still insufficient to combat the escalating counterfeit behaviors. Inspired by the hindwing structure of Troides magellanus, we prepared a new kind of anti&#8208;counterfeiting material taking advantage of both physical and chemical structures to display multiple optical states. The chemical units (luminescent lanthanide) were blended with physical units (monodispersed colloidal particles) and mediating molecule, which were then assembled into periodic photonic crystal structure at room temperature in less than 10 seconds through a new and scalable assembly technique called molecule&#8208;mediated shear&#8208;induced assembly technique (MSAT). The as&#8208;prepared photonic crystal films feature three unique optical states, each displaying structural, fluorescent and phosphorescent color under different lighting conditions, which integrates colors from both physical and chemical origins. Furthermore, through incorporating different luminescent materials into different parts of the photonic crystal pattern, a high&#8208;level information encryption system was designed to be capable of carrying three distinct types of information. Thanks to this powerful and universal tool of MSAT, it is now possible to assemble different&#8208;sized, even irregular non&#8208;spherical units with monodispersed spherical units into large&#8208;sized and high&#8208;quality photonic crystal films, which provides an easy access to incorporating new features into the photonic crystal system.

         <title>300 Times Increased Diffusive Skyrmion Dynamics and Effective Pinning Reduction by Periodic Field Excitation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Thermally induced skyrmion dynamics as well as skyrmion pinning effects in thin films have attracted significant interest. While pinning poses challenges in deterministic skyrmion devices and slows down skyrmion diffusion, for applications in non&#8208;conventional computing, both pinning of an appropriate strength and skyrmion diffusion speed are key. Here, we employ periodic field excitations to realize an increase of the skyrmion diffusion by more than two orders of magnitude. Amplifying the excitation, we report a drastic reduction of the effective skyrmion pinning and observe a transition from pinning&#8208;dominated diffusive hopping to dynamics approaching free diffusion. By tailoring the field oscillation frequency and amplitude, we demonstrate continuous tuning of the effective pinning and skyrmion dynamics, which is a key asset and enabler for non&#8208;conventional computing applications. We find that the periodic excitations additionally allow us to stabilize skyrmions at different sizes for field values that are inaccessible in static systems, opening up new approaches to ultra&#8208;fast skyrmion motion by transiently exciting moving skyrmions.

         <title>Porous Organic Polymer with Hierarchical Structure and Limited Volume Expansion for Ultrafast and Highly Durable Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Sustainable organic electrode materials, as promising alternatives to conventional inorganic electrode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), are still challenging to realize long&#8208;lifetime and high&#8208;rate batteries because of their poor conductivity, limited electroactivity, and severe dissolution. It is also urgent to deeply reveal their electrochemical mechanism and evolution processes. A porous organic polymer (POP) with a conjugated and hierarchical structure is designed and synthesized here. The unique molecule and structure endowed the POP with electron delocalization, high ionic diffusivity, plentiful active sites, exceptional structure stability, and limited solubility in electrolytes. When evaluated as an anode for SIBs, the POP exhibits appealing electrochemical properties regarding reversible capacity, rate behaviors, and long&#8208;duration life. Importantly, using judiciously combined experiment and theoretical computation, including in situ TEM, and ex situ spectroscopic, we reveal the Na&#8208;storage mechanism and dynamic evolution processes of the POP, including 12&#8208;electron reaction process with Na, low volume expansion (125%&#8208;106% versus the initial 100%), and stable composition and structure evolution during repeating sodiation/de&#8208;sodiation processes. This quantitative design for ultrafast and highly durable sodium storage in the POP could be of immediate benefit for the rational design of organic electrode materials with ideal electrochemical properties.

         <title>Quantifiable Relationship Between Antibacterial Efficacy and Electro&#8208;Mechanical Intervention on Nanowire Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Physical disruption is an important antibacterial means as it is lethal to bacteria without spurring antimicrobial resistance. However, it is very challenging to establish a quantifiable relationship between the antibacterial efficacy and physical interactions such as mechanical and electrical forces. Herein, titanium nitride (TN) nanowires with adjustable orientations and capacitances are prepared to exert gradient electro&#8208;mechanical forces on bacteria. While vertical nanowires show the strongest mechanical force resulting in an antibacterial efficiency of 0.62 log reduction (versus 0.22 for tiled and 0.36 for inclined nanowires, respectively), addition of electrical charges maximizes the electro&#8208;mechanical interactions and elevates the antibacterial efficacy to more than 3 log reduction. Biophysical and biochemical analyses indicate that electrostatic attraction by electrical charge narrows the interface. The electro&#8208;mechanical intervention more easily stiffens and rips the bacteria membrane, disturbing the electron balance and generating intracellular oxidative stress. The antibacterial ability is maintained in vivo and bacteria&#8208;challenged rats are protected from serious infection. The physical bacteria&#8208;killing process demonstrated here can be controlled by adjusting the electro&#8208;mechanical interactions. Overall, these results revealed important principles for rationally designing high&#8208;performance antibacterial interfaces for clinical applications.

         <title>Multifunctional Nanogenerator&#8208;Integrated Metamaterial Concrete Systems for Smart Civil Infrastructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Multifunctional construction materials can form the building blocks for next generation smart civil infrastructure systems. Such integrated infrastructure systems can self&#8208;sustain their operations, offer designated structural behavior, and achieve a range of functionalities. Concrete is known as the most paramount construction material worldwide. Creating multifunctional concrete materials with advanced functionalities and mechanical tunability is a critical step toward reimagining the traditional civil infrastructure systems. Here, we present a new class of lightweight composite metamaterial concrete with unprecedented mechanical properties along with energy harvesting and sensing functionalities. The proposed nanogenerator&#8208;integrated metamaterial concrete system is created via integrating the mechanical metamaterial and triboelectric energy harvesting paradigms. The metamaterial concrete system is composed of reinforcement auxetic polymer lattices with snap&#8208;through buckling behavior fully embedded inside a conductive cement matrix. We rationally design this composite structure to induce contact&#8208;electrification between its layers under mechanical excitations/triggering. The conductive cement enhanced with graphite powder serves as the electrode in the proposed system, while providing the desired mechanical performance. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept prototypes are built with different geometries and reinforcement levels. Experimental studies are conducted to investigate the mechanical and electrical properties of the designed prototypes. The proposed metamaterial concrete systems are tuned to achieve up to 15% compressibility under cycling loading. The power output of the nanogenerator&#8208;integrated metamaterial concrete prototypes reaches 330 &#956;W. Furthermore, we demonstrate the self&#8208;powered sensing functionality of the nanogenerator concrete systems for distributed health monitoring of large&#8208;scale concrete structures. The metamaterial concrete paradigm can possibly enable designing concrete systems with a broad range of properties such as low/high stiffness, scalability, and shapeability for prefabricated elements. Finally, we highlight the potential of the proposed metamaterial concrete paradigm to transform the current design practice in concrete industry.

         <title>Size&#8208;Induced Ferroelectricity in Antiferroelectric Oxide Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Despite extensive studies on size effects in ferroelectrics, how structures and properties evolve in antiferroelectrics with reduced dimensions still remains elusive. Given the enormous potential of utilizing antiferroelectrics for high energy&#8208;density storage applications, understanding their size effects would provide key information for optimizing device performances at small scales. Here, we investigate the fundamental intrinsic size dependence of antiferroelectricity in lead&#8208;free NaNbO3 membranes. Via a wide range of experimental and theoretical approaches, we probe an intriguing antiferroelectric&#8208;to&#8208;ferroelectric transition upon reducing membrane thickness. This size effect leads to a ferroelectric single&#8208;phase below 40&#160;nm as well as a mixed&#8208;phase state with ferroelectric and antiferroelectric orders coexisting above this critical thickness. Furthermore, we show that the antiferroelectric and ferroelectric orders are electrically switchable. First&#8208;principle calculations further reveal the observed transition is driven by the structural distortion arising from the membrane surface. Our work provides direct experimental evidence for intrinsic size&#8208;driven scaling in antiferroelectrics and demonstrates enormous potential of utilizing size effects to drive emergent properties in environmentally benign lead&#8208;free oxides with the membrane platform.

         <title>FeNC Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalyst with High Utilisation Penta&#8208;coordinated sites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Atomic Fe in N&#8208;doped carbon (FeNC) electrocatalysts for oxygen (O2) reduction at the cathode of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) are the most promising alternative to platinum&#8208;group&#8208;metal catalysts. Despite recent progress on atomic FeNC O2 reduction, their controlled synthesis and stability for practical applications remains challenging. A two&#8208;step synthesis approach has recently led to significant advances in terms of Fe&#8208;loading and mass activity; however, the Fe utilisation remains low owing to the difficulty of building scaffolds with sufficient porosity that electrochemically exposes the active sites. Herein, we addressed this issue by coordinating Fe in a highly porous nitrogen doped carbon support (&#8764;3295 m2 g&#8722;1), prepared by pyrolysis of inexpensive 2,4,6&#8208;triaminopyrimidine and a Mg2+ salt active site template and porogen. Upon Fe coordination, a high electrochemical active site density of 2.54&#215;1019 sites gFeNC&#8722;1 and a record 52% FeNx electrochemical utilisation based on in situ nitrite stripping was achieved. The Fe single atoms are characterised pre&#8208; and post&#8208;electrochemical accelerated stress testing by aberration&#8208;corrected high&#8208;angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy, showing no Fe clustering. Moreover, ex situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and low&#8208;temperature M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy suggest the presence of penta&#8208;coordinated Fe sites, which were further studied by density functional theory calculations.

         <title>Efficient and Robust Molecular Solar Thermal Fabric for Personal Thermal Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Molecular solar thermal (MOST) materials, which can efficiently capture solar energy and release it as heat on demand, are promising candidates for future personal thermal management (PTM) applications, preferably in the form of fabrics. However, developing MOST fabrics with high energy storage capacity and stable working performance remains a significant challenge because of low energy density of the molecular materials and their leakage from the fabric. Here, we report an efficient and robust MOST fabric for PTM using azopyrazole&#8208;containing microcapsules with a deep&#8208;UV filter shell. The MOST fabric, which could co&#8208;harvest solar and thermal energy, achieved efficient photo&#8208;charging and photo&#8208;discharging (&gt;90% photoconversion), a high energy density of 2.5&#160;kJ m&#8722;2, and long&#8208;term storage sustainability at month scale. Moreover, it could undergo multiple cycles of washing, rubbing, and recharging without significant loss of energy storage capacity. This MOST microcapsule strategy was easily used for the scalable production of a MOST fabric for solar thermal moxibustion. This achievement offers a promising route for the application of wearable MOST materials with high energy storage performance and robustness in PTM.

The MOST fabric, which could co-harvest solar and thermal energy, achieved efficient photo-charging and photo-discharging (&amp;gt;90% photoconversion), a high energy density of 2.5&#160;kJ m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and long-term storage sustainability at month scale. Moreover, it could undergo multiple cycles of washing, rubbing, and recharging without significant loss of energy storage capacity. This MOST microcapsule strategy was easily used for the scalable production of a MOST fabric for solar thermal moxibustion. This achievement offers a promising route for the application of wearable MOST materials with high energy storage performance and robustness in PTM.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>An advanced strategy to enhance TENG output: reducing triboelectric charge decay</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The Internet of Things (IoT) is poised to accelerate the construction of smart cities. However, it requires more than 30 billion sensors to realize the IoT vision, posing great challenges and opportunities for industries of self&#8208;powered sensors. Triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), an emerging new technology, is capable of easily convert energy from surrounding environment into electricity, thus TENG has tremendous application potential in self&#8208;powered IoT sensors. At present, TENG encounters a bottleneck to boost output for large&#8208;scale commercial use if just by promoting triboelectric charge generation, because the output is decided by the triboelectric charge dynamic equilibrium between generation and decay. To break this bottleneck, we focus on the strategy of reducing triboelectric charge decay to enhance TENG output. First, multiple mechanisms of triboelectric charge decay are summarized in detail with basic theoretical principles for future research. Furthermore, recent advances in reducing triboelectric charge decay are thoroughly reviewed and outlined in three aspects: inhibition and application of air breakdown, simultaneous inhibition of air breakdown and triboelectric charge drift/diffusion, and inhibition of triboelectric charge drift/diffusion. Finally, challenges and future research focus are proposed. This review provides reference and guidance for enhancing TENG output.

         <title>Breaking the Photostability and pH Limitation of Halo&#8208;Fluoresceins through Chitosan Conjugation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Halo&#8208;fluoresceins are widely used in cell and tissue staining, intracellular sensing, and photodynamic therapy, but their notorious photo&#8208;instability and pH dependence restrict their applications, especially in long&#8208;term visible light exposure and acidic environments. To overcome these limations, here we proposed a strategy of conjugating chitosan with the carboxyl group of fluorescein (CS&#8208;halofluorescein). The cross&#8208;linked polymer chains and the hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks of chitosan help shielding out 1O2 from direct attacking the encapsulated halo&#8208;fluoresceins, leading to 2 orders of magnitudes lower photobleaching rate. Meanwhile, the condensation of primary amines of chitosan with the carboxyl group on halo&#8208;fluorescein blocked the pH&#8208;dependent intramolecular spirocyclization, leading to pH&#8208;inert fluorescein derivatives. The greatly improved photostability and pH inertness of CS&#8208;halofluoresceins could be harvested for aerobic photoredox synthesis and photodynamic bacteria inactivation in extremely acidic media. Moreover, food additive nature of chitosan and erythrosine (TIF) and excellent film&#8208;forming property of chitosan allowed coating&#8208;based light&#8208;assisted preservation of perishable fruits, leading to appreciably extended shelf life of fruits (e.g., perishable strawberry, rt: &gt; 3 days; 4&#176;C: &gt; 5 days).

         <title>Metal&#8722;halide Perovskite Nanocrystal Superlattice: Self&#8208;Assembly and Optical Fingerprints</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of nanocrystals into superlattices is a fascinating process that not only changes geometric morphology, but also creates unique properties that considerably enrich the materials toolbox for new applications. Numerous studies have driven the blossoming of superlattices from various aspects. These include precise control of size and morphology, enhancement of properties, exploitation of functions, integration of the material into miniature devices. The effective synthesis of metal&#8722;halide perovskite nanocrystals has advanced research on self&#8208;assembly of building blocks into micrometer&#8208;sized superlattices. More importantly, these materials exhibit abundant optical features, such as highly coherent superfluorescence, amplified spontaneous laser emission, and adjustable spectral redshift, facilitating basic research and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art applications. This review summarizes recent advances in the field of metal&#8722;halide perovskite superlattices. We begin with basic packing models and introduce various stacking configurations of superlattices that form the theoretical basis for self&#8208;assembled metal&#8722;halide perovskite superlattices. We also discuss the potential of multiple capping ligands and highlight their crucial role in superlattice growth, followed by detailed reviews of synthesis and characterization methods. We then consider how these optical features can be distinguished and present contemporary applications. We conclude this review with a list of unanswered questions and an outlook on their potential use in quantum computing and quantum communications to stimulate further research in this area.

         <title>Trojan Horse Nanocapsule Enabled In Situ Modulation of the Phenotypic Conversion of Th17 Cells to Treg Cells for the Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis in Mice</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanocapsule (nC)&#8208;coupled Th17 cells transmigrates across the blood&#8211;brain barrier and homes to the inflamed MS niche in a &#8220;Trojan Horse&#8221;&#8208;like manner. Upon ROS stimulation, (Aminooxy)&#8208;acetic acid is released from the nC, and subsequently enables in situ transformation of Th17 into Treg cells. This phenotypic conversion leads to a domino&#8208;like immune response that is conducive to MS therapy.








Abstract
Th17/Treg imbalance is closely related to the occurrence and development of multiple sclerosis (MS), and the transdifferentiation of Th17 cells into Treg cells may contribute to the resolution of inflammation, presenting a therapeutic strategy for MS. To modulate this phenotypic shift in situ, a &#8220;Trojan horse&#8221;&#8208;like hybrid system, nanocapsule&#8208;coupled Th17 cells, is reported for MS treatment. Following intravenous injection into MS mice, the hybrid system efficiently transmigrates across the blood&#8211;brain barrier and homes to the inflamed MS niche. (Aminooxy)&#8208;acetic acid, a transdifferentiation inducer, is locally released upon the production of ROS and in turn taken up by Th17 cells. It is demonstrated that the Trojan horse hybrid system enables in situ phenotypic transdifferentiation of Th17 cells into anti&#8208;inflammatory Treg cells. This phenotypic conversion leads to a domino&#8208;like immune response that is conducive to MS therapy. Overall, this work highlights a new pathway for accurate modulation of the phenotypes of adoptively transferred cells in situ, from proinflammatory to anti&#8208;inflammatory for MS therapy, and may be broadly applicable for patients suffering from other autoimmune diseases.

         <title>Unlocking the Full Potential of Electron&#8208;Acceptor Molecules for Efficient and Stable Hole Injection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient and stable hole injection into organic semiconductors is realized by controlling the charged states of acceptor molecules. The high electron affinity of a neutral acceptor molecule enables direct hole injection even into materials used for a blue&#8208;emitting layer, and highly efficient, pure&#8208;blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes with an extraordinarily low turn&#8208;on voltage of 2.67&#160;V are realized.








Abstract
Understanding the hole&#8208;injection mechanism and improving the hole&#8208;injection property are of pivotal importance in the future development of organic optoelectronic devices. Electron&#8208;acceptor molecules with high electron affinity (EA) are widely used in electronic applications, such as hole injection and p&#8208;doping. Although p&#8208;doping has generally been studied in terms of matching the ionization energy (IE) of organic semiconductors with the EA of acceptor molecules, little is known about the effect of the EA of acceptor molecules on the hole&#8208;injection property. In this work, the hole&#8208;injection mechanism in devices is completely clarified, and a strategy to optimize the hole&#8208;injection property of the acceptor molecule is developed. Efficient and stable hole injection is found to be possible even into materials with IEs as high as 5.8 eV by controlling the charged state of an acceptor molecule with an EA of about 5.0&#160;eV. This excellent hole&#8208;injection property enables direct hole injection into an emitting layer, realizing a pure blue organic light&#8208;emitting diode with an extraordinarily low turn&#8208;on voltage of 2.67&#160;V, a power efficiency of 29&#160;lm W&#8722;1, an external quantum efficiency of 28% and a Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage y coordinate of less than 0.10.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Responsive STAT3 Inhibitor Nanoprodrug Combined with Oncolytic Virus Elicits Synergistic Antitumor Immune Responses by Igniting Pyroptosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combination therapy with oHSV&#160;+&#160;MPNPs boosts the effects of immune checkpoint therapy by inducing gasdermin&#8208;E&#8208;based tumor pyroptosis, reversing the immunosuppressive microenvironment, and inducing effective immune memory, thus potentiating anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 effects against local recurrence and pulmonary metastasis and consequently elongating the survival period. The nanoprodrugs&#160;+&#160;oncolytic viruses strategy represents a promising way to overcome immune checkpoint blockade resistance.








Abstract
Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy shows excellent efficacy against malignancies; however, insufficient tumor immunogenicity and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) are considered as the two major stumbling blocks to a broad ICB response. Here, a combinational therapeutic strategy is reported, wherein TME&#8208;reactive oxygen species/pH dual&#8208;responsive signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 inhibitor nanoprodrugs MPNPs are combined with oncolytic herpes simplex virus 1 virotherapy to synergistically ignite pyroptosis for enhancing immunotherapy. MPNPs exhibit a certain level of tumor accumulation, reduce tumor cell stemness, and enhance antitumor immune responses. Furthermore, the simultaneous application of oncolytic viruses (OVs) confers MPNPs with higher tumor penetration capacity and remarkable gasdermin&#8208;E&#8208;mediated pyroptosis, thereby reshaping the TME and transforming &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors into &#8220;hot&#8221; ones. This &#8220;fire of immunity&#8221; strategy successfully activates robust T&#8208;cell&#8208;dependent antitumor responses, potentiating ICB effects against local recurrence and pulmonary metastasis in preclinical &#8220;cold&#8221; murine triple&#8208;negative breast cancer and syngeneic oral cancer models. Collectively, this work may pave a new way and offer an unprecedented opportunity for the combination of OVs with nanomedicine for cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>From Ferroelectric Material Optimization to Neuromorphic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferroelectric materials combine a voltage driven switching mechanism with nonvolatility making them promising for nonvolatile devices. Here the material basics and the three different memory devices are described as a starting point for an in&#8208;depth discussion of the current status of implementing ferroelectric devices for neuromorphic computing.








Abstract
Due to the voltage driven switching at low voltages combined with nonvolatility of the achieved polarization state, ferroelectric materials have a unique potential for low power nonvolatile electronic devices. The competitivity of such devices is hindered by compatibility issues of well&#8208;known ferroelectrics with established semiconductor technology. The discovery of ferroelectricity in hafnium oxide changed this situation. The natural application of nonvolatile devices is as a memory cell. Nonvolatile memory devices also built the basis for other applications like in&#8208;memory or neuromorphic computing. Three different basic ferroelectric devices can be constructed: ferroelectric capacitors, ferroelectric field effect transistors and ferroelectric tunneling junctions. In this article first the material science of the ferroelectricity in hafnium oxide will be summarized with a special focus on tailoring the switching characteristics towards different applications.The current status of nonvolatile ferroelectric memories then lays the ground for looking into applications like in&#8208;memory computing. Finally, a special focus will be given to showcase how the basic building blocks of spiking neural networks, the neuron and the synapse, can be realized and how they can be combined to realize neuromorphic computing systems. A summary, comparison with other technologies like resistive switching devices and an outlook completes the paper.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Narrowband Near&#8208;Infrared Responsive J&#8208;Aggregates of Fused Quinoidal Tetracyanoindacenodithiophene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of J&#8208;aggregates based on quinoidal indacenodithiophenes are reported with an ultra&#8208;narrow bandwidth (full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum, FWHM&#160;=&#160;22&#160;nm) absoprtion peak located at 770&#160;nm. A combination of excited&#8208;state lifetime measurements and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction measurements are employed to probe their J&#8208;aggregate behavior. NIR phototransistors exhibit consistent photoresponse throughout the illumination intensity range at selective wavelength.








Abstract
Narrowband photoresponsive molecules are highly coveted in high&#8208;resolution imaging, sensing, and monochromatic photodetection, especially those extending into the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) spectral range. Here, a new class of J&#8208;aggregating materials based on quinoidal indacenodithiophenes (IDTs) that exhibit an ultra&#8208;narrowband (full width half maxima of 22&#160;nm) NIR absorption peak centered at 770&#160;nm is reported. The spectral width is readily tuned by the length of the solubilizing alkyl group, with longer chains resulting in significant spectral narrowing. The J&#8208;aggregate behavior is confirmed by a combination of excited state lifetime measurements and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction measurements. Their utility as electron&#8208;transporting materials is demonstrated in both transistor and phototransistor devices, with the latter demonstrating good response at NIR wavelengths (780&#160;nm) over a range of intensities.

         <title>A Multifunctional Interphase Layer Enabling Superior Sodium&#8208;Metal Batteries under Ambient Temperature and &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional interphase consisting of disodium selenide and metal vanadium is developed for the Na anode via an in situ spontaneous chemical reaction. It possesses high sodiophilicity, strong mechanical strength, excellent ionic conductivity, and fast desolvation of solvated Na+, which can boost Na&#8208;ion adsorption and transport, realizing homogenous Na deposition without dendrites under ambient temperature and &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
The sodium (Na)&#8208;metal anode with high theoretical capacity and low cost is promising for construction of&#160;high&#8208;energy&#8208;density metal batteries. However, the unsatisfactory interface between Na and the liquid electrolyte induces tardy ion transfer kinetics and dendritic Na growth, especially at ultralow temperature (&#8722;40&#160;&#176;C). Herein, an artificial heterogeneous interphase consisting of disodium selenide (Na2Se) and metal vanadium (V) is produced on the surface of Na (Na@Na2Se/V) via an in situ spontaneous chemical reaction. Such interphase layer possesses high sodiophilicity, excellent ionic conductivity, and high Young's modulus, which can promote Na&#8208;ion adsorption and transport, realizing homogenous Na deposition without dendrites. The symmetric Na@Na2Se/V cell exhibits outstanding cycling life span of over 1790&#160;h (0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2/1 mAh cm&#8722;2) in carbonate&#8208;based electrolyte. More remarkably, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the artificial Na2Se/V hybrid interphase can accelerate the desolvation of solvated Na+ at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C. The Na@Na2Se/V electrode thus exhibits exceptional electrochemical performance in symmetric cell (over 1500&#160;h at 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2/0.5 mAh cm&#8722;2) and full cell (over 700 cycles at 0.5 C) at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C. This work provides an avenue to design artificial heterogeneous interphase layers for superior high&#8208;energy&#8208;density metal batteries at ambient and ultralow temperatures.

         <title>Versatile Assembly of Metal&#8208;Phenolic Network Foams Enabled by Tannin&#8208;Cellulose Nanofibers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Metal&#8208;phenolic networks (MPN) foams are prepared using colloidal suspensions of tannin&#8208;containing cellulose nanofibers (CNF) that are ice&#8208;templated and thawed in ethanolic media in the presence of metal nitrates. The MPN facilitates the formation of solid foams by air&#8208;drying, given the strength and self&#8208;supporting nature of the obtained tannin&#8208;cellulose nanohybrid structures. The porous characteristics and (dry and wet) compression strength of the foams are rationalized by the development of secondary, cohesive layers combined with a hydrogen bonding network involving the CNF. The shrinkage of the MPN foams is as low as 6% for samples prepared with 2.5&#8208;10% tannic acid (or condensed tannin at 2.5%) with respect to CNF content. The strength of the MPN foams reaches a maximum at 10% tannic acid (using Fe(III) ions), equivalent to a compressive strength 70% higher than that produced with tannin&#8208;free CNF foams. Overall, a straightforward framework is introduced to synthesize MPN foams whose physical and mechanical properties are tailored by the presence of tannins as well as the metal ion species that enable the metal&#8208;phenolic networking. Depending on the metal ion, the foams are amenable to modification according to the desired application

The porous characteristics and (dry and wet) compression strength of the foams are rationalized by the development of secondary, cohesive layers combined with a hydrogen bonding network involving the CNF. The shrinkage of the MPN foams is as low as 6% for samples prepared with 2.5-10% tannic acid (or condensed tannin at 2.5%) with respect to CNF content. The strength of the MPN foams reaches a maximum at 10% tannic acid (using Fe&lt;sup&gt;(III)&lt;/sup&gt; ions), equivalent to a compressive strength 70% higher than that produced with tannin-free CNF foams. Overall, a straightforward framework is introduced to synthesize MPN foams whose physical and mechanical properties are tailored by the presence of tannins as well as the metal ion species that enable the metal-phenolic networking. Depending on the metal ion, the foams are amenable to modification according to the desired application&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>CO2 Adsorption in a Robust Iron(III) Pyrazolate&#8208;Based MOF: Molecular&#8208;Level Details and Frameworks Dynamics From Powder X&#8208;Ray Diffraction Adsorption Isotherms</title>

Abstract
Understanding adsorption processes at the molecular level, with multi&#8208;technique approaches, is nowadays at the frontier of porous materials research. In this work we show that with a proper data treatment, in situ high&#8208;resolution powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (HR&#8208;PXRD) at variable temperature and gas pressure can reveal atomic details of the accommodation sites, the framework dynamics as well as thermodynamic information (isosteric heat of adsorption) of the CO2 adsorption process in the robust iron(III) pyrazolate&#8208;based MOF Fe2(BDP)3 [H2BDP = 1,4&#8208;bis(1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl)benzene]. Highly reliable &#8220;HR&#8208;PXRD adsorption isotherms&#8221; can be constructed from CO2 molecules occupancy values. The &#8220;HR&#8208;PXRD adsorption isotherms&#8221; accurately match the results of conventional static and dynamic gas sorption experiments and Monte Carlo simulations. These results are indicative of the impact of the molecular&#8208;level behavior on the bulk properties of the system under study and of the potential of the presented multi&#8208;technique approach to understand adsorption processes in metal&#8208;organic frameworks.

         <title>Printable Epsilon&#8208;Type Structure Transistor Arrays with Highly Reliable Physical Unclonable Functions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Printed electronics promises to drive the future data&#8208;intensive technologies, with its potential to fabricate novel devices over large&#8208;area with low cost on non&#8208;traditional substrates. In these emerging technologies, there exists a large digital information flow, which requires secure communication and authentication. Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) offer a promising built&#8208;in hardware&#8208;security system comparable to biometrical data, which can be constructed by device&#8208;specific intrinsic variations in the additive manufacturing process of active devices. However, printed PUFs typically exploit the inherent variation in layer thickness and roughness of active devices. The current in the devices with enough significant changes to increase the robustness to external environment noise is still a challenge. Here, we demonstrated printable epsilon&#8208;type structure ITO transistor arrays to construct high&#8208;reliability PUFs by modifying the coffee&#8208;ring structure. The epsilon&#8208;type structure improves the printing scalability, film quality, and device reliability. Furthermore, the print&#8208;induced uncertainty along the channel thickness and length can lead to changes in the carrier concentration. Notably, the randomly distributed printing droplets in a small area significantly increase this uncertainty. As a result, the PUFs exhibit near&#8208;ideal uniformity, uniqueness, randomness, and reliability. Additionally, the PUFs are resilient against machine learning&#8208;based attacks with a prediction accuracy of only 55% without post&#8208;processing.

         <title>Deciphering Adverse Detrapped Hole Transfer in Hot&#8208;electron Photoelectric Conversion at Infrared Wavelengths</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hot&#8208;carrier devices are promising alternatives for enabling pathbreaking photoelectric conversion. However, existing hot&#8208;carrier devices suffer from low efficiencies, particularly in the infrared region, and ambiguous physical mechanisms. We discover the competitive interfacial transfer mechanisms of detrapped holes and hot electrons in hot&#8208;carrier devices. Through photocurrent polarity research and optical&#8208;pump THz&#8208;probe (OPTP) spectroscopy, we verify that detrapped hole transfer (DHT) and hot electron transfer (HET) dominate the low&#8208; and high&#8208;density excitation responses, respectively. The photocurrent ratio assigned to DHT and HET increases from 6.6% to over 1133.3% as the illumination intensity decreases. DHT induces severe degeneration of the external quantum efficiency (EQE), especially at low illumination intensities. The EQE of a hot&#8208;electron device can theoretically increase by over 2 orders of magnitude at 10&#160;mW/cm2 through DHT elimination. The OPTP results show that competitive transfer arises from the carrier oscillation type and carrier density&#8208;related Coulomb screening. The screening intensity determines the excitation weight and hot&#8208;electron cooling scenes and thereby the transfer dynamics.

         <title>Tuning of Polar Domain Boundaries in Nonpolar Perovskite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Domain boundaries with macroscopic polarity are discovered in a nonpolar PbZrO3&#8208;based single crystal. They can be preferentially created and erased by applying a small stress. The polarity can be enhanced or switched with a small electric field. Atomistic&#8208;structural analysis reveals that the polar domains boundaries are formed by a combination of &#8593;&#8593;&#8595;&#8208;like ferrielectric structures.








Abstract
Domain boundaries in ferroic materials are found to have various physical properties not observed in the surrounding domains. Such differences can be enhanced and bring promising functionalities when centrosymmetric nonpolar materials encounter polar domain boundaries. In this work, a tunable polar domain boundary is discovered in an antiferroelectric single crystal. Under a small stress or electric field, the density, volume, and polarity of the boundaries are successfully controlled.

         <title>Amorphous MoOx with high oxophilicity interfaced with PtMo alloy nanoparticles boosts anti&#8208;CO hydrogen electrocatalysis</title>

Abstract
Advancing electrocatalysts for alkaline hydrogen oxidation/evolution reaction (HOR/HER) is essential for anion exchange membrane&#8208;based devices. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt&#8208;based electrocatalysts for alkaline HOR are suffering from low intrinsic activities and severe CO poisoning due to challenge of simultaneously optimizing surface adsorptions towards different adsorbates. Herein, we overcome this challenge by tuning atomic MoOx layer with high oxophilicity onto PtMo nanoparticles with the optimized Had, OHad and COad adsorptions for boosting anti&#8208;CO poisoning hydrogen cycle electrocatalysis in alkaline media. For alkaline HOR, this catalyst exhibits a high kinetic and an exchange current density of 3.19&#160;mA &#956;gPt&#8722;1 at 50&#160;mV versus RHE and 0.83&#160;mA cmPt&#8722;2, 10.3 and 3.8&#8208;fold higher than those of commercial Pt/C, respectively. For alkaline HER, it achieves an unprecedented overpotential of 37&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Experimental and theoretical studies show that the orchestrated electronic and oxophilic regulation of PtMo/MoOx interface nanoparticles simultaneously optimize Had and OHad adsorption for boosting alkaline hydrogen electrocatalysis, whereas reactive oxygen from amorphous MoOx atomic layer lowers the CO oxidation reaction barrier, leading to superior anti&#8208;poisoning ability even at 100&#160;ppm CO.

Abstract
Rechargeable sodium metal batteries (RSMBs) with high energy density and low cost are attracting extensive attention as promising energy storage technologies. However, the poor cyclability and safety issues caused by unstable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) structure and dendrite issues limit their practical application. Herein, we theoretically predict that constructing the Ni3S2/Ni3P heterostructure with high work function can lower the Fermi energy level, and therefore effectively suppressing continuous electrolyte decomposition derived from the electron tunneling effect after long&#8208;term sodiation process. Furthermore, we experimentally fabricate the Ni3S2/Ni3P heterostructure on 3D porous nickel foam (Ni3S2/Ni3P@NF) as advanced Na anode current collector. The seamless Ni3S2/Ni3P heterostructurenot only offers abundant active sites to induce uniform Na+ deposition and enhance ion transport kinetics, but facilitates the formation of stable SEI for dendrite&#8208;free sodium anode, which are confirmed by Cryo&#8208;TEM tests and in situ spectroscopy characterization. As a result, the Na composite anode (Ni3S2/Ni3P@NF@Na) delivers stable plating/stripping process of 5000 hours and high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.7% over 2500 cycles. More impressively, the assembled sodium ion full cell displays ultralong cycle life of 10000 cycles at 20 C. Our strategy on stabilizing the sodium metal anode gives fundamental insight into the potential construction of advanced RSMBs.

         <title>B&#8208;N Bond Embedded Triplet Terpolymers with Small Singlet&#8208;Triplet Energy Gaps for Suppressing Non&#8208;Radiative Recombination and Improving Blend Morphology in Organic Solar Cells</title>

Abstract
Suppressing the photon energy loss (Eloss), especially the non&#8208;radiative loss, is of importance to further improve the device performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, typical &#960;&#8208;conjugated semiconductors possess a large singlet&#8722;triplet energy gap (&#916;EST), leading to a lower triplet state than charge transfer state and contributing to a non&#8208;radiative loss channel of photocurrent by triplet state. Herein, a series of triplet polymer donors were developed by introducing a BNIDT block into the PM6 polymer backbone. The high electron affinity of BNIDT and the opposite resonance effect of B&#8208;N bond in BNIDT resulted in the lowered highest occupies molecular orbital (HOMO) and the largely reduced &#916;EST. Moreover, the morphology of the active blends was also optimized by fine&#8208;tuning the BNIDT content. Therefore, the non&#8208;radiative recombination via the terminal triplet loss channels and morphology traps was effectively suppressed. The PNB&#8208;3 (with 3% BNIDT):L8&#8208;BO device exhibited both small &#916;EST and optimized morphology, favoring the more efficient charge transfer and transport. Finally, the simultaneously enhanced Voc of 0.907&#160;V, Jsc of 26.59&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, and FF of 78.86% contributed to a champion PCE of 19.02%. Therefore, introducing B&#8208;N bond into the benchmark polymers is a possible avenue toward higher&#8208;performance of OSCs.

         <title>Role of Magnetic Defects in Tuning Ground States of Magnetic Topological Insulators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Magnetic defects play an important, but poorly understood, role in magnetic topological insulators (TIs). For example, topological surface transport and bulk magnetic properties are controlled by magnetic defects in Bi2Se3&#8208;based dilute ferromagnetic (FM) TIs and MnBi2Te4 (MBT)&#8208;based antiferromagnetic (AFM) TIs. Despite its nascent ferromagnetism, our&#160;inelastic neutron scattering data show that a fraction of the Mn defects in Sb2Te3 form strong AFM dimer singlets within a quintuple block. The AFM superexchange coupling occurs via Mn&#8208;Te&#8208;Mn linear bonds and is identical to the AFM coupling between antisite defects and the FM Mn layer in MBT, establishing common interactions in the two materials classes. We&#160;also find that the FM correlations in (Sb1 &#8722; xMnx)2Te3 are likely driven by magnetic defects in adjacent quintuple blocks across the van der Waals gap. In addition to providing answers to long&#8208;standing questions about the evolution of FM order in dilute TI, these results also show that the evolution of global magnetic order from AFM to FM in Sb&#8208;substituted MBT is controlled by defect engineering of the intrablock and interblock&#160;coupling.

         <title>25.24%&#8208;Efficiency FACsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells Enabled by Intermolecular Esterification Reaction of DL&#8208;Carnitine Hydrochloride</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Judicious tailoring the interface between SnO2 electron transport layer (ETL) and perovskite buried surface plays a pivotal role in obtaining highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, a DL&#8208;Carnitine hydrochloride (DL) is incorporated into perovskite/SnO2 interface to suppress defect&#8208;states density. A DL&#8208;dimer is obtained at interface by an intermolecular esterification reaction. For the SnO2 film, the Cl&#8722; in DL&#8208;dimer can passivate oxygen vacancies (Vo) through electrostatic coupling, while N in DL&#8208;dimer can coordinate with the Sn4+ to passivate Sn&#8208;related defects. For the perovskite film, the DL&#8208;dimer can passivate FA+ defects via hydrogen bond and Pb&#8208;related defects more efficiently than DL monomer. Upon the DL&#8208;dimer modification, the interfacial defects are effectively passivated and the quality of the resultant perovskite film is improved. As a result, the DL&#8208;treated device achieves a gratifying open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.20&#160;V and a champion PCE of 25.24%, which is a record value among all the reported FACsPbI3 PSCs. In addition, the unencapsulated devices exhibit a charming stability, sustaining 99.20% and 90.00% of their initial PCEs after aging in air for 1200&#160;h and continuously operating at the maximum power point (MPP) tracking for 500&#160;h, respectively.

         <title>Higher&#8208;order Topological States in Thermal Diffusion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Unlike conventional topological materials that carry topological states at their boundaries, higher&#8208;order topological materials are able to support topological states at boundaries of boundaries, such as corners and hinges. While band topology has been recently extended into thermal diffusion for thermal metamaterials, its realization is limited to a one&#8208;dimensional (1D) thermal lattice, lacking access to the higher&#8208;order topology. In this work, we report on the experimental realization of a higher&#8208;order thermal topological insulator in a generalized two&#8208;dimensional (2D) diffusion lattice. The topological corner states for thermal diffusion are observed in the bandgap of diffusion rate of the bulk, as a consequence of the anti&#8208;Hermitian nature of the diffusion Hamiltonian. The topological protection of these thermal corner states is demonstrated with the stability of their diffusion profile in the presence of amorphous deformation. Our work constitutes the first realization of higher&#8208;order topology in a purely diffusive systems, and opens the door for future thermal management with topological protection beyond 1D geometries.

Abstract
Ischemic stroke (IS) is one of the most common causes of disability and death. Thrombolysis and neuroprotection are two current major therapeutic strategies to overcome the ischemic and reperfusion damages. Here, we have designed a novel peptide&#8208;templated MnO2 nanozyme (PNzyme/MnO2) that integrates the thrombolytic activity of the functional peptides with the ROS scavenging ability of the nanozyme. Through the self&#8208;assembled polypeptides that contains multiple functional motifs, the novel peptide&#8208;templated nanozyme is able to bind fibrin in the thrombus, cross blood brain barrier, and finally accumulate in the ischemic neuronal tissues, where the thrombolytic motif is &#8220;switch&#8208;on&#8221; by the action of thrombin. In mice and rat IS models, the PNzyme/MnO2 prolonged blood circulation time and exhibited strong thrombolytic action, and reduced the ischemic damages in brain tissues. Moreover, this peptide&#8208;templated nanozyme also effectively inhibited the activation of astrocytes and the secretion of pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines. These data indicated that rationally designed PNzyme/MnO2 nanozyme exerts both thrombolytic and neuroprotective actions. Giving its long half&#8208;life in the blood and ability to target brain thrombi, the biocompatible nanozyme may serve as a novel therapeutic agent to improve the efficacy and prevent secondary thrombosis during the treatment of IS.

         <title>Perspectives of 2D MXene Tribology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The past two years have witnessed increased experimental and theoretical efforts toward studying MXenes&#8217; mechanical and tribological properties when used as lubricant additives, reinforcement phases in composites, or solid lubricant coatings.&#160;The most promising results in MXene tribology are summarized, future important problems to be pursued further are outlined, and methodological recommendations are provided.








Abstract
The large and rapidly growing family of 2D early transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides (MXenes) raises significant interest in the materials science and chemistry of materials communities. Discovered a little more than a decade ago, MXenes have already demonstrated outstanding potential in various applications ranging from energy storage to biology and medicine. The past two years have witnessed increased experimental and theoretical efforts toward studying MXenes&#8217; mechanical and tribological properties when used as lubricant additives, reinforcement phases in composites, or solid lubricant coatings. Although research on the understanding of the friction and wear performance of MXenes under dry and lubricated conditions is still in its early stages, it has experienced rapid growth due to the excellent mechanical properties and chemical reactivities offered by MXenes that make them adaptable to being combined with other materials, thus boosting their tribological performance. In this perspective, the most promising results in the area of MXene tribology are summarized, future important problems to be pursued further are outlined, and methodological recommendations&#160;that could be useful for experts as well as newcomers to MXenes research, in particular, to the emerging area of MXene tribology, are provided.

         <title>Chemical Tuning Meets 2D Molecular Magnets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical tuning including lithiation control and solvent coordination can significantly modify magnetic interaction in molecule&#8208;based magnets for high&#8208;temperature magnetic order and large coercivity. Through those technical routes and processing, 2D molecule&#8208;based magnets with an applicable magnetic performance of ferrites are demonstrated. The considerable energy product evidences its worth for obtaining practical molecule&#8208;based magnets.








Abstract
2D magnets provoke a surge of interest in large anisotropy in reduced dimensions and are promising for next&#8208;generation information technology where dynamic magnetic tuning is essential. Until recently, the crucial metal&#8208;organic magnet Cr(pyz)2&#183;xLiCl&#183;yTHF with considerable high coercivity and high&#8208;temperature magnetic order opens up a new platform to control magnetism in metal&#8208;organic materials at room temperature. Here, an in&#8211;situ chemical tuning route is reported to realize the controllable transformation of low&#8208;temperature magnetic order into room&#8208;temperature hard magnetism in Cr(pyz)2&#183;xLiCl&#183;yTHF. The chemical tuning via electrochemical lithiation and solvation/desolvation exhibits continuously variable magnetic features from cryogenic magnetism to the room&#8208;temperature optimum performance of coercivity (Hc) of 8500&#160;Oe and energy product of 0.6 MGOe. Such chemically flexible tunability of room&#8208;temperature magnetism is ascribed to the different degrees of lithiation and solvation that modify the stoichiometry and Cr&#8208;pyrazine coordination framework. Furthermore, the additively manufactured hybrid magnets show air stability and electromagnetic induction, providing potential applications. The findings here suggest chemical tuning as a universal approach to control the anisotropy and magnetism of 2D hybrid magnets at room temperature, promising for data storage, magnetic refrigeration, and spintronics.

         <title>Manipulating Charge&#8208;Transfer Kinetics of Lithium&#8208;Rich Layered Oxide Cathodes in Halide All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lithium&#8208;rich layered oxide (LLO) cathode theoretically enables all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries with high energy density owing to its high capacity. However, the low electronic conductivity and highly reactive lattice oxygen impede its application. By introducing conductive additives in electrodes and modifying the surface chemistry of LLO, high&#8208;efficiency electronic networks and stable LLO/electrolyte interfaces can be obtained, thus boosting the charge&#8208;transfer kinetics.








Abstract
Employing lithium&#8208;rich layered oxide (LLO) as the cathode of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) is highly desired for realizing high energy density. However, the poor kinetics of LLO, caused by its low electronic conductivity and significant oxygen&#8208;redox&#8208;induced structural degradation, has impeded its application in ASSBs. Here, the charge transfer kinetics of LLO is enhanced by constructing high&#8208;efficiency electron transport networks within solid&#8208;state electrodes, which considerably minimizes electron transfer resistance. In addition, an infusion&#8208;plus&#8208;coating strategy is introduced to stabilize the lattice oxygen of LLO, successfully suppressing the interfacial oxidation of solid electrolyte (Li3InCl6) and structural degradation of LLO. As a result, LLO&#8208;based ASSBs exhibit a high discharge capacity of 230.7 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 C and ultra&#8208;long cycle stability over 400 cycles. This work provides an in&#8208;depth understanding of the kinetics of LLO in solid&#8208;state electrodes, and affords a practically feasible strategy to obtain high&#8208;energy&#8208;density ASSBs.

         <title>Direct Visualization of Magnetic Correlations in Frustrated Spinel ZnFe2O4</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single crystal diffuse neutron scattering data on the frustrated magnet ZnFe2O4 are used to calculate the 3D magnetic difference pair distribution function, which provide a model&#8208;free reconstruction of the local magnetic correlations. Analysis of the correlation intensities gives insight into the possible underlying exchange mechanisms and a preferred spin&#8208;cluster model.








Abstract
Magnetic materials with the spinel structure (A2+B3+2O4) form the core of numerous magnetic devices, and ZnFe2O4 constitutes a peculiar example where the nature of the magnetism is still unresolved. Susceptibility measurements revealed a cusp around Tc&#160;= 13 K resembling an antiferromagnetic transition, despite the positive Curie&#8211;Weiss temperature determined to be &#920;CW&#160;= 102.8(1) K. Bifurcation of field&#8208;cooled and zero&#8208;field&#8208;cooled data below Tc in conjunction with a frequency dependence of the peak position and a non&#8208;zero imaginary component below Tc shows it is in fact associated with a spin&#8208;glass transition. Highly structured magnetic diffuse neutron scattering from single crystals develops between 50&#160;K and 25&#160;K revealing the presence of magnetic disorder which is correlated in nature. Here, the 3D&#8208;m&#916;PDF method is used to visualize the local magnetic ordering preferences, and ferromagnetic nearest&#8208;neighbor and antiferromagnetic third nearest&#8208;neighbor correlations are shown to be dominant. Their temperature dependence is extraordinary with some flipping in sign and a strongly varying correlation length. The correlations can be explained by orbital interaction mechanisms for the magnetic pathways and a preferred spin cluster. This study demonstrates the power of the 3D&#8208;m&#916;PDF method in visualizing complex quantum phenomena thereby providing a way to obtain an atomic&#8208;scale understanding of magnetic frustration.

The correlations can be explained by orbital interaction mechanisms for the magnetic pathways and a preferred spin cluster. This study demonstrates the power of the 3D-m&#916;PDF method in visualizing complex quantum phenomena thereby providing a way to obtain an atomic-scale understanding of magnetic frustration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells via Improved Sequential Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) via the two&#8208;step sequential deposition show advantages of easy fabrication and decent performance repeatability. Whereas, it is still challenging to implement this technique in the inverted PSCs. Here, an improved sequential two&#8208;step method for inverted PSCs is demonstrated by a binary modulation system and a champion efficiency of 23.4% is realized with remarkable device stability.








Abstract
Inverted&#8208;structure metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attractive advantages like low&#8208;temperature processability and outstanding device stability. The two&#8208;step sequential deposition method shows the benefits of easy fabrication and decent performance repeatability. Nevertheless, it is still challenging to achieve high&#8208;performance inverted PSCs with similar or equal power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) compared to the regular&#8208;structure counterparts via this deposition method. Here, an improved two&#8208;step sequential deposition technique is demonstrated via treating the bottom organic hole&#8208;selective layer with the binary modulation system composed of a polyelectrolyte and an ammonium salt. Such improved sequential deposition method leads to the spontaneous refinement of up and buried interfaces for the perovskite films, contributing to high film quality with significantly reduced defect density and better charge transportation. As a result, the optimized PSCs show a large enhancement in the open&#8208;circuit voltage by 100&#160;mV and a dramatic lift in the PCE from 18.1% to 23.4%, delivering the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performances for inverted PSCs. Moreover, good operational and thermal stability is achieved upon the improved inverted PSCs. This innovative strategy helps gain a deeper insight into the perovskite crystal growth and defect modulation in the inverted PSCs based on the two&#8208;step sequential deposition method.

         <title>A MgFe&#8208;LDH Nanosheet&#8208;Incorporated Smart Thermo&#8208;Responsive Hydrogel with Controllable Growth Factor Releasing Capability for Bone Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A smart injectable thermo&#8208;responsive hydrogel composed of bone morphogenetic protein 2&#8208;functionalized MgFe&#8208;layered double hydroxide&#160;nanosheets and platelet&#8208;derived growth factor&#8208;BB&#8208;loaded chitosan/silk fibroin hydrogel is designed and constructed to achieve the sequential release of dual growth factors and sustained release of bioactive Mg2+/Fe3+ ions for highly efficient bone regeneration.








Abstract
Although growth factor (GF)&#8208;loaded hydrogels have been explored as promising materials in repairing bone defects, it still remains challenging to construct smart hydrogels with excellent gelation/mechanical properties as well as controllable GF releasing capability. Herein, the incorporation of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP&#8208;2)&#8208;functionalized MgFe&#8208;layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets into chitosan/silk fibroin (CS) hydrogels loaded with platelet&#8208;derived growth factor&#8208;BB (PDGF&#8208;BB) to construct a smart injectable thermo&#8208;responsive hydrogel (denoted as CSP&#8208;LB), which can achieve a burst release of PDGF&#8208;BB and a sustained release of BMP&#8208;2, for highly efficient bone regeneration is reported. The incorporation of MgFe&#8208;LDH in CS hydrogel not only shortens the gelation time and decreases sol&#8211;gel transition temperature, but also enhances the mechanical property of the hydrogel. Because of the sequential release of dual&#8208;GFs and sustained release of bioactive Mg2+/Fe3+ ions, the in vitro experiments prove that the CSP&#8208;LB hydrogel exhibits excellent angiogenic and osteogenic properties compared with the CS hydrogel. In vivo experiments further prove that the CSP&#8208;LB hydrogel can significantly enhance bone regeneration with higher bone volume and mineral density than that of the CS hydrogel. This smart thermo&#8208;sensitive CSP&#8208;LB hydrogel possesses excellent gelation capability and angiogenic and osteogenic properties, thus providing a promising minimally invasive solution for bone defect treatment.

         <title>Ultrahigh Strain&#8208;Insensitive Integrated Hybrid Electronics Using Highly Stretchable Bilayer Liquid Metal Based Conductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;high strain&#8208;insensitive hybrid integrated electronics constructed by a self&#8208;formed amphiphilic bilayer highly stretchable conductor is reported based on liquid metal composite and peeling strategy. The amphiphilic bilayer conductor can self&#8208;solder its interface with rigid electronics, anchor well with substrates, and shows ultrahigh conductivity, stretchability, self&#8208;healability, and interconnect functions. The unique materials hold the potential for strain&#8208;resilient integrated bioelectronics and wearables.








Abstract
Human&#8208;interfaced electronic systems require strain&#8208;resilient circuits. However, present integrated stretchable electronics easily suffer from electrical deterioration and face challenges in forming robust multilayered soft&#8208;rigid hybrid configurations. Here, a bilayer liquid&#8208;solid conductor (b&#8208;LSC) with amphiphilic properties is introduced to reliably interface with both rigid electronics and elastomeric substrates. The top liquid metal can self&#8208;solder its interface with rigid electronics at a resistance 30% lower than the traditional tin&#8208;soldered rigid interface. The bottom polar composite comprising liquid metal particles and polymers can not only reliably interface with elastomers but also help the b&#8208;LSC heal after breakage. The b&#8208;LSC can be scalably fabricated by printing and subsequent peeling strategies, showing ultra&#8208;high strain&#8208;insensitive conductivity (maximum 22&#160;532&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1), extreme stretchability (2260%), and negligible resistance change under ultra&#8208;high strain (0.34 times increase under 1000% strain). It can act as stretchable vertical interconnect access for connecting multilayered layouts and can be scalably and universally fabricated on various substrates with a resolution of &#8776;200&#160;&#181;m. It is demonstrated that it can construct stretchable sensor arrays, multi&#8208;layered stretchable displays, highly integrated haptic user&#8208;interactive optoelectric E&#8208;skins, visualized heaters, robot touch sensing systems, and wireless powering for wearable electronics.

         <title>Self&#8208;Healing Electronics for Prognostic Monitoring of Methylated Circulating Tumor DNAs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wearable device with self&#8208;healing electronics is developed for highly sensitive and cost&#8208;effective analysis of methylated ctDNAs from transdermal extracted interstitial fluid (ISF), which is demonstrated as a skin patch device for monitoring the disease indicative biomarker. Especially, the device is featured with a flexible construction and remains electrically functional significant structural defects are induced by bending or distortion from everyday usage.








Abstract
Methylated circulating DNAs (ctDNAs) have recently been reported as a promising biomarker for early cancer diagnostics, but limited tools are currently available for continuous and dynamic profiling of ctDNAs and their methylation levels, especially when such assays need to be conducted in point&#8208;of&#8208;care (POC) scenarios. Here, a self&#8208;healing bioelectronic patch (iMethy) is developed that combines transdermal interstitial fluid (ISF) extraction and field effect transistor&#8208;based (FET&#8208;based) biosensing for dynamic monitoring of methylated ctDNAs as a prognostic approach for cancer risk management. The projection micro&#8208;stereolithography&#8208;based 3D patterning of an Eutectic Gallium&#8208;Indium (EGaIn) circuit with an unprecedented 10&#160;&#181;m resolution enables the construction of self&#8208;healing EGaIn microfluidic circuits that remain conductive under 100% strain and self&#8208;healing under severe destruction. In combination with continuous transdermal ISF sampling of methylated ctDNAs, iMethy can detect ctDNAs as low as 10&#8722;16&#160;m in cellular models and is capable of phenotypic analysis of tumor growth in rodent animals. As the first demonstration of a wearable device for real&#8208;time in vivo analysis of disease&#8208;indicative biomarkers, this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study well demonstrated the potential of the iMethy platform for cancer risk management based on dynamic transdermal surveillance of methylated ctDNAs via a painless and self&#8208;administrable procedure.

         <title>Unlock the Potassium Storage Behavior of Single&#8208;Phased Tungsten Selenide Nanorods via Large Cation Insertion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, in/ex situ experiments and theoretical calculations are performed to investigate the role of tunnel cations in governing the charge storage performances of electrodes by focusing on K&#8208;ions in layer&#8208;structured WSe2. It clearly reveals that the pre&#8208;intercalated K&#8208;ions inside interlayers of WSe2 increases the electronic conductivity, and improves K&#8208;ion diffusivity, having fast kinetics response during the K&#8208;ion (de)insertion.








Abstract
Metal chalcogenide anodes with a layered structure have been regarded as potential K&#8208;based electrochemical energy storage devices with high energy density for large&#8208;scale energy storage applications. However, their development is impeded by the slow K&#8208;ion transport kinetics and poor structural stability. In this work, the energy&#8208;storage behavior is investigated first and decisively associated them with the capacity&#8208;degradation of the promising layer&#8208;structured WSe2 from an integrated chemical and physical point of view. Then, a single&#8208;phased WSe2 with pre&#8208;intercalated high K content (SP&#8208;KxWSe2) is designed to overcome the capacity&#8208;degradation issue fundamentally. Theoretical calculations clarify the beneficial effect of K&#8208;ions inside the interlayer of WSe2 on boosting its electrochemical performance, including increasing the electronic conductivity, promoting the K&#8208;ion diffusivity, and improving the structural stability. The novel design enables the K&#8208;ions pre&#8208;intercalated WSe2 anode material to exhibit a high reversible specific capacity of 211 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 A g&#8722;1 and superior cycling stability (89.3% capacity retention after 5000 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1). Especially, the K&#8208;ion hybrid capacitor, assembled from the anode of SP&#8208;KxWSe2 and the cathode of porous activated carbon, delivers superior energy&#8208;density up to 175&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, high power&#8208;density as well as exceptional cycling stability.

         <title>Zn&#8208;Doped P&#8208;Type InAs Nanocrystal Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Post&#8208;synthesis doping of InAs nanocrystals with Zn enables the fabrication of heavy metal free, RoHS compliant nanocrystal&#8208;based field effect transistors, which exhibit either n&#8208; or p&#8208;type characteristics. Advanced structural characterization of the doped nanocrystals highlights the importance of Zn dopant chemistry on the doping efficiency. This study sets the stage for future development of nanocrystals&#8208;based opto&#8208;electronics applications.








Abstract
Doped heavy metal&#8208;free III&#8211;V semiconductor nanocrystal quantum dots (QDs) are of great interest both from the fundamental aspects of doping in highly confined structures, and from the applicative side of utilizing such building blocks in the fabrication of p&#8211;n homojunction devices. InAs nanocrystals (NCs), that are of particular relevance for short&#8208;wave IR detection and emission applications, manifest heavy n&#8208;type character poising a challenge for their transition to p&#8208;type behavior. The p&#8208;type doping of InAs NCs is presented with Zn &#8211; enabling control over the charge carrier type in InAs QDs field effect transistors. The post&#8208;synthesis doping reaction mechanism is studied for Zn precursors with varying reactivity. Successful p&#8208;type doping is achieved by the more reactive precursor, diethylzinc. Substitutional doping by Zn2+ replacing In3+ is established by X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy analysis. Furthermore, enhanced near infrared&#160;photoluminescence is observed due to surface passivation by Zn as indicated from elemental mapping utilizing high&#8208;resolution electron microscopy corroborated by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy study. The demonstrated ability to control the carrier type, along with the improved emission characteristics, paves the way towards fabrication of optoelectronic devices active in the short&#8208;wave infrared region utilizing heavy&#8208;metal free nanocrystal building blocks.

         <title>Precisely Constructed Metal Sulfides with Localized Single&#8208;Atom Rhodium for Photocatalytic C&#8722;H Activation and Direct Methanol Coupling to Ethylene Glycol</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalyst composed of alternately lined wurtzite and zinc&#8208;blende segments in one dimension and single&#8208;atom Rh selectively located on the wurtzite segment demonstrates record&#8208;breaking performances for the selective conversion of methanol to ethylene glycol via preferential C&#8722;H activation. The regularly lined heterojunctions facilitate the separation and migration of photogenerated carriers, and the single&#8208;atom Rh catalyzes methanol adsorption and activation.








Abstract
Although there are many studies on photocatalytic environmental remediation, hydrogen evolution, and chemical transformations, less success has been achieved for the synthesis of industrially important and largely demanded bulk chemicals using semiconductor photocatalysis, which holds great potential to drive unique chemical reactions that are difficult to implement by the conventional heterogeneous catalysis. The performance of semiconductors used for photochemical synthesis is, however, usually unsatisfactory due to limited efficiencies in light harvesting, charge&#8208;carrier separation, and surface reactions. The precise construction of heterogeneous photocatalysts to facilitate these processes is an attractive but challenging goal. Here, single&#8208;atom rhodium&#8208;doped metal sulfide nanorods composed of alternately stacked wurtzite/zinc&#8208;blende segments are successfully designed and fabricated, which demonstrate record&#8208;breaking efficiencies for visible light&#8208;driven preferential activation of C&#8722;H bond in methanol to form ethylene glycol (EG), a key bulk chemical used for the production of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) polymer. The wurtzite/zinc&#8208;blende heterojunctions lined regularly in one dimension accelerate the charge&#8208;carrier separation and migration. Single&#8208;atom rhodium selectively deposited onto the wurtzite segment with photogenerated holes accumulated facilitates methanol adsorption and C&#8722;H activation. The present work paves the way to harnessing photocatalysis for bulk chemical synthesis with structure&#8208;defined semiconductors.

         <title>Quenching&#8208;Induced Defects Liberate the Latent Reversible Capacity of Lithium Titanate Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intrinsic defects in quenched lithium titanate anodes enable reversible extraction of Li ions that are unextractable in pristine state, thus facilitating these native Li ions to participate in electrochemical cycling, which leads to a sustained capacity of 202 mAh g&#8722;1 in the 1.0&#8211;2.5&#160;V range with excellent rate capability and cycling stability.








Abstract
Interest in defect engineering for lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) materials is sparked by its ability to tailor electrical conductivity and introduce extra active sites for electrochemical reactions. However, harvesting excessive intrinsic defects in the bulk of the electrodes rather than near their surface remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Here, a versatile strategy of quenching is demonstrated, which is exercised in lithium titanate (Li4Ti5O12, LTO), a renowned anode for LIBs, to achieve off&#8208;stoichiometry in the interior region. In situ synchrotron analysis and atomic&#8208;resolution microscopy reveal the enriched oxygen vacancies and cation redistribution after ice&#8208;water quenching, which can facilitate the native unextractable Li ions to participate in reversible cycling. The fabricated LTO anode delivers a sustained capacity of 202 mAh g&#8722;1 in the 1.0&#8211;2.5&#160;V range with excellent rate capability and overcomes the poor cycling stability seen in conventional defective electrodes. The feasibility of tuning the degree of structural defectiveness via quenching agents is also proven, which can open up an intriguing avenue of research to harness the intrinsic defects for improving the energy density of rechargeable batteries.

         <title>Partially Nitrided Ni Nanoclusters Achieve Energy&#8208;Efficient Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to CO at Ultralow Overpotential</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes supported partially nitrided Ni nanoclusters catalyst achieves the lowest onset overpotential of 16&#160;mV for CO2RR to CO, and reaches CO Faraday efficiency &#8805; 99.0% at overpotential of only 166&#160;mV, much lower than of the isolated Ni single&#8208;atom catalyst, with the highest cathode energy efficiency of 86.9%.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) offers a promising strategy to lower CO2 emission while producing value&#8208;added chemicals. A great challenge facing CO2RR is how to improve energy efficiency by reducing overpotentials. Herein, partially nitrided Ni nanoclusters (NiNx) immobilized on N&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes (NCNT) for CO2RR are reported, which achieves the lowest onset overpotential of 16&#160;mV for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO and the highest cathode energy efficiency of 86.9% with CO Faraday efficiency &gt;99.0% to date. Interestingly, NiNx/NCNT affords a CO generation rate of 43.0&#160;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 at a low potential of &#8722;0.572&#160;V (vs RHE). DFT calculations reveal that the NiNx nanoclusters favor *COOH formation with lower Gibbs free energy than isolated Ni single&#8208;atom, hence lowering CO2RR overpotential. As NiNx/NCNT is applied to a membrane electrode assembly system coupled with oxygen evolution reaction, a cell voltage of only 2.13&#160;V is required to reach 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, with total energy efficiency of 62.2%.

         <title>Low&#8208;Voltage Intrinsically Stretchable Organic Transistor Amplifiers for Ultrasensitive Electrophysiological Signal Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a van der Waals&#8208;controlling elastomer/carbon quantum dot interfacial polarization methodology is developed to fabricate intrinsically stretchable organic thin&#8208;film transistors (ISOTFTs) with low operating voltage below 5 V, 100% strain tolerance, and excellent operational stability. Further, the transistor amplifier shows a high gain of 90 V V&#8722;1 and ultrasensitive detection for human electro&#8208;oculogram signals.








Abstract
Stretchability is a prerequisite for electronic skin devices. However, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art stretchable thin&#8208;film transistors do not possess sufficiently low operating voltages and good stability, significantly limiting their use in real&#8208;world biomedical applications. Herein, a van der Waals&#8208;controlling elastomer/carbon quantum dot interfacial polarization methodology is proposed to form a hybrid polymer dielectric with 620% tensile strain and large&#8208;area film uniformity (&gt;A4 paper size). Using the hybrid polymer dielectrics, the prepared intrinsically stretchable organic thin&#8208;film transistors demonstrate a low operating voltage below 5&#160;V, 100% strain tolerance, and excellent operational stability, as well as a high on&#8208;current/off&#8208;current ratio of 105 and a steep subthreshold slope of 500&#160;mV dec&#8722;1. Based on this device technology, an amplifier with a high gain of 90&#160;V V&#8722;1 among the highest values of reported stretchable transistors is realized. This amplifier is at the first time applied to detect human electrophysical signals with an output signal amplitude of over 0.2&#160;V, which even outperforms other types of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art organic amplifiers for human electrophysiology monitoring. This stretchable device technology sufficiently meets the safety and portability requirements of wearable biomedical applications, opening a new opportunity to e&#8208;skin with signal control and amplification capabilities.

         <title>Shape Morphing Directed by Spatially Encoded, Dually Responsive Liquid Crystalline Elastomer Micro&#8208;Actuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shape morphing from nonresponsive elastomer films can be preprogrammed by spatially embedding anisotropic shape&#8208;changing micro&#8208;actuators with certain orientations and height distributions, offering a robust pathway to simultaneously control in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane bending. This work will broaden the material palette for shape&#8208;morphing&#8208;based applications such as soft robotics, smart wearables, displays, and sensors.








Abstract
Liquid crystalline elastomers (LCEs) with intrinsic molecular anisotropy can be programmed to morph shapes under external stimuli. However, it is difficult to program the position and orientation of individual mesogenic units separately and locally, whether in&#8208;plane or out&#8208;of&#8208;plane, since each mesogen is linked to adjacent ones through the covalently bonded polymer chains. Here, dually responsive, spindle&#8208;shaped micro&#8208;actuators are synthesized from LCE composites, which can reorient under a magnetic field and change the shape upon heating. When the discrete micro&#8208;actuators are embedded in a conventional and nonresponsive elastomer with programmed height distribution and in&#8208;plane orientation in local regions, robust and complex shape morphing induced by the cooperative actuations of the locally distributed micro&#8208;actuators, which corroborates with finite element analysis, are shown. The spatial encoding of discrete micro&#8208;actuators in a nonresponsive matrix allows to decouple the actuators and the matrix, broadening the material palette to program local and global responses to stimuli for applications including soft robotics, smart wearables, and sensors.

         <title>Embedded 3D Printing of Multimaterial Polymer Lattices via Graph&#8208;Based Print Path Planning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A graph theory&#8208;based algorithm, termed Automated Eulerian Route Optimization (AERO), is developed to automate the embedded 3D printing of periodic and stochastic lattices with hundreds of struts. This integrated method is used to construct multi&#8208;material polymer lattices with tailored mechanical properties.








Abstract
Recent advances in computational design and 3D printing enable the fabrication of polymer lattices with high strength&#8208;to&#8208;weight ratio and tailored mechanics. To date, 3D lattices composed of monolithic materials have primarily been constructed due to limitations associated with most commercial 3D printing platforms. Here, freeform fabrication of multi&#8208;material polymer lattices via embedded three&#8208;dimensional (EMB3D) printing is demonstrated. An algorithm is developed first that generates print paths for each target lattice based on graph theory. The effects of ink rheology on filamentary printing and the effects of the print path on resultant mechanical properties are then investigated. By co&#8208;printing multiple materials with different mechanical properties, a broad range of periodic and stochastic lattices with tailored mechanical responses can be realized opening new avenues for constructing architected matter.

         <title>Elucidating the Origins of High Preferential Crystal Orientation in Quasi&#8208;2D Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nucleation process to form quasi&#8208;2D&#160;perovskites is thermodynamically controlled using the methylammonium chloride additive to achieve films with a degree of preferential orientation of 94%, capable of withstanding 97% relative humidity for 10&#160;h without degradation. Combining microscopic, macroscopic, and spectrographic observations, the thermodynamics enabling preferential crystal growth are inferred.








Abstract
Incorporating large organic cations to form&#160;2D&#160;and mixed 2D/3D structures significantly increases the stability of perovskite solar cells. However, due to their low electron mobility, aligning the organic sheets to ensure unimpeded charge transport is critical to rival the high performances of pure 3D systems. While additives such as methylammonium chloride (MACl) can enable this preferential orientation, so far, no complete description exists explaining how they influence the nucleation process to grow highly aligned crystals. Here, by investigating the initial stages of the crystallization, as well as partially and fully formed perovskites grown using MACl, the origins underlying this favorable alignment are inferred. This mechanism is studied by employing 3&#8208;fluorobenzylammonium in quasi&#8208;2D perovskite solar cells. Upon assisting the crystallization with MACl, films with a degree of preferential orientation of 94%, capable of withstanding moisture levels of 97% relative humidity for 10&#160;h without significant changes in the crystal structure are achieved. Finally, by combining macroscopic, microscopic, and spectroscopic studies, the nucleation process leading to highly oriented perovskite films is elucidated. Understanding this mechanism will aid in the rational design of future additives to achieve more defect tolerant and stable perovskite optoelectronics.

&lt;p&gt;Incorporating large organic cations to form&#160;2D&#160;and mixed 2D/3D structures significantly increases the stability of perovskite solar cells. However, due to their low electron mobility, aligning the organic sheets to ensure unimpeded charge transport is critical to rival the high performances of pure 3D systems. While additives such as methylammonium chloride (MACl) can enable this preferential orientation, so far, no complete description exists explaining how they influence the nucleation process to grow highly aligned crystals. Here, by investigating the initial stages of the crystallization, as well as partially and fully formed perovskites grown using MACl, the origins underlying this favorable alignment are inferred. This mechanism is studied by employing 3-fluorobenzylammonium in quasi-2D perovskite solar cells. Upon assisting the crystallization with MACl, films with a degree of preferential orientation of 94%, capable of withstanding moisture levels of 97% relative humidity for 10&#160;h without significant changes in the crystal structure are achieved. Finally, by combining macroscopic, microscopic, and spectroscopic studies, the nucleation process leading to highly oriented perovskite films is elucidated. Understanding this mechanism will aid in the rational design of future additives to achieve more defect tolerant and stable perovskite optoelectronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Merging Passivation in Synthesis Enabling the Lowest Open&#8208;Circuit Voltage Loss for PbS Quantum Dot Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergistic passivation is performed in the direct synthesis of conductive lead sulfide colloidal quantum dot (PbS CQD) inks. The improved passivation effect is intactly delivered to the final photovoltaic device, leading a high open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc)) of 0.71&#160;V and efficiency of 13.3%, which results in the lowest Voc loss (0.35&#160;eV) for the reported PbS CQD solar cells.








Abstract
The high open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) loss arising from insufficient surface passivation is the main factor that limits the efficiency of current lead sulfide colloidal quantum dots (PbS CQDs) solar cell. Here, synergistic passivation is performed in the direct synthesis of conductive PbS CQD inks by introducing multifunctional ligands to well coordinate the complicated CQDs surface with the thermodynamically optimal configuration. The improved passivation effect is intactly delivered to the final photovoltaic device, leading to an order lower surface trap density and beneficial doping behavior compared to the control sample. The obtained CQD inks show the highest photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 24% for all photovoltaic PbS CQD inks, which is more than twice the reported average PLQY value of &#8776;10%. As a result, a high Voc of 0.71&#160;V and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.3% is achieved, which results in the lowest Voc loss (0.35&#160;eV) for the reported PbS CQD solar cells with PCE &gt;10%, comparable to that of perovskite solar cells. This work provides valuable insights into the future CQDs passivation strategies and also demonstrates the great potential for the direct&#8208;synthesis protocol of PbS CQDs.

         <title>A Gate Programmable van der Waals Metal&#8208;Ferroelectric&#8208;Semiconductor Vertical Heterojunction Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Prototypical gate&#8208;programmable memory that seamlessly integrates the functionality of both ferroelectric memristor and metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor field effect transistor (MOS&#8208;FET), in a vertical fashion is demonstrated. Its memristive characteristics can be quenched (enabled), by setting the Fermi level of MoS2 inside (outside) of its band gap via a top gate, yielding a gate programmable non&#8208;volatile memory for multi&#8208;bit data storage and more.








Abstract
Ferroelectricity, one of the keys to realize non&#8208;volatile memories owing to the remanent electric polarization, is an emerging phenomenon in the 2D limit. Yet the demonstrations of van der Waals (vdW) memories using 2D ferroelectric materials as an ingredient are very limited. Especially, gate&#8208;tunable ferroelectric vdW memristive device, which holds promises in future multi&#8208;bit data storage applications, remains challenging. Here, a gate&#8208;programmable multi&#8208;state memory is shown by vertically assembling graphite, CuInP2S6, and MoS2 layers into a metal(M)&#8208;ferroelectric(FE)&#8208;semiconductor(S) architecture. The resulted devices seamlessly integrate the functionality of both FE&#8208;memristor (with ON&#8211;OFF ratios exceeding 105 and long&#8208;term retention) and metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor field effect transistor (MOS&#8208;FET). Thus, it yields a prototype of gate tunable giant electroresistance with multi&#8208;levelled ON&#8208;states in the FE&#8208;memristor in the vertical vdW assembly. First&#8208;principles calculations further reveal that such behaviors originate from the specific band alignment between the FE&#8208;S interface. Our&#160;findings pave the way for the engineering of ferroelectricity&#8208;mediated memories in future implementations of 2D&#160;nanoelectronics.

         <title>Conversion of Classical Light Emission from a Nanoparticle&#8208;Strained WSe2 Monolayer into Quantum Light Emission via Electron Beam Irradiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spectrally overlapping mid&#8208;gap emitters from deterministically positioned, nanoparticle&#8208;strained WSe2 monolayers are converted into isolatable, anti&#8208;bunched emitters using electron beam irradiation. The localized emission before and after irradiation are compared as a function of strain magnitude to assign the spectral transformation to the suppression of weakly coupled mid&#8208;gap state&#8208;strain pairs through strongly coupled mid&#8208;gap state&#8208;strain pairs introduced through electron beam irradiation.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state single photon emitters (SPEs) within atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have recently attracted interest as scalable quantum light sources for quantum photonic technologies. Among TMDs, WSe2 monolayers (MLs) are promising for the deterministic fabrication and engineering of SPEs using local strain fields. The ability to reliably produce isolatable SPEs in WSe2 is currently impeded by the presence of numerous spectrally overlapping states that occur at strained locations. Here nanoparticle (NP) arrays with precisely defined positions and sizes are employed to deterministically create strain fields in WSe2 MLs, thus enabling the systematic investigation and control of SPE formation. Using this platform, electron beam irradiation at NP&#8208;strained locations transforms spectrally overlapped sub&#8208;bandgap emission states into isolatable, anti&#8208;bunched quantum emitters. The dependence of the emission spectra of WSe2 MLs as a function of strain magnitude and exposure time to electron beam irradiation is quantified and provides insight into the mechanism for SPE production. Excitons selectively funnel through strongly coupled sub&#8208;bandgap states introduced by electron beam irradiation, which suppresses spectrally overlapping emission pathways and leads to measurable anti&#8208;bunched behavior. The findings provide a strategy to generate isolatable SPEs in 2D materials with a well&#8208;defined energy range.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Agglomeration of Single&#8208;Atom Platinum in Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt single atoms (SAs) supported on TiO2 surfaces form clusters and undergo reduction (by photogenerated electrons) to a metallic state over the course of a photocatalytic reaction. Although this process affects &gt;90% of the loaded Pt SAs, Pt SA&#8208;TiO2 photocatalysts show stable H2 production. Density&#8208;functional theory calculations suggest Pt SA interaction with H adatom as a destabilizing factor.








Abstract
With recent advances in the field of single&#8208;atoms (SAs) used in photocatalysis, an unprecedented performance of atomically dispersed co&#8208;catalysts has been achieved. However, the stability and agglomeration of SA co&#8208;catalysts on the semiconductor surface may represent a critical issue in potential applications. Here, the photoinduced destabilization of Pt SAs on the benchmark photocatalyst, TiO2, is described. In aqueous solutions within illumination timescales ranging from few minutes to several hours, light&#8208;induced agglomeration of Pt SAs to ensembles (dimers, multimers) and finally nanoparticles takes place. The kinetics critically depends on the presence of sacrificial hole scavengers and the used light intensity. Density&#8208;functional theory&#160;calculations attribute the light induced destabilization of the SA Pt species to binding of surface&#8208;coordinated Pt with solution&#8208;hydrogen (adsorbed H atoms), which consequently weakens the Pt SA bonding to the TiO2 surface. Despite the gradual aggregation of Pt SAs into surface clusters and their overall reduction to metallic state, which involves &gt;90% of Pt SAs, the overall photocatalytic H2 evolution remains virtually unaffected.

Despite the gradual aggregation of Pt SAs into surface clusters and their overall reduction to metallic state, which involves &amp;gt;90% of Pt SAs, the overall photocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution remains virtually unaffected.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Targeting Theranostics of Atherosclerosis by Dual&#8208;Responsive Nanoplatform via Photoacoustic Imaging and Three&#8208;In&#8208;One Integrated Lipid Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A theranostic nanoplatform PLCDP@PMH is constructed with atherosclerosis&#8208;targeting accumulation and reactive oxygen species (ROS)/matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) dual&#8208;responsiveness, which indicates a plaque&#8208;specific photoacoustic diagnosis and a three&#8208;in&#8208;one therapeutic strategy of integrated lipid management via reducing lipid uptake, enhancing lipid efflux, and actuating lipid removal. PLCDP@PMH provides a candidate for the diagnosis of early&#8208;stage plaques, the inhibition of atherosclerosis progression, and the reversal of formed lesions.








Abstract
Atherosclerosis, as a life&#8208;threatening cardiovascular disease with chronic inflammation and abnormal lipid enrichment, is often difficult to treat timely due to the lack of obvious symptoms. In this work, a theranostic nanoplatform is constructed for the noninvasive in vivo diagnosis, plaque&#8208;formation inhibition, and the lesion reversal of atherosclerosis. A three&#8208;in&#8208;one therapeutic complex is constructed and packaged along with a polymeric photoacoustic probe into nanoparticles named as PLCDP@PMH, which indicates an atherosclerosis&#8208;targeting accumulation and a reactive oxygen species (ROS)/matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) dual&#8208;responsive degradation. The photoacoustic probe suggests a lesion&#8208;specific imaging on atherosclerotic mice with an accurate and distinct recognition of plaques. At the same time, the three&#8208;in&#8208;one complex performs an integrated lipid management through the inhibition of macrophages M1&#8208;polarization, liver X receptor (LXR)&#8208;mediated up&#8208;regulation of ATP&#8208;binding cassette transporter A1/G1 (ABCA1/G1) and the cyclodextrin&#8208;assisted lipid dissolution, which lead to the reduced lipid uptake, enhanced lipid efflux, and actuated lipid removal. The in vivo evaluations reveal that PLCDP@PMH can suppress the lesion progression and further reverse the formed plaques under a diet without high fat. Hence, PLCDP@PMH provides a candidate for the theranostics of early&#8208;stage atherosclerosis and delivers an impressive potential on the reversal of formed atherosclerotic lesions.

         <title>Modulating the Site Density of Mo Single Atoms to Catch Adventitious O Atoms for Efficient H2O2 Oxidation with Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mo single atoms (SAs) on red polymeric carbon nitrides (RPCN) catch the adventitious O atoms in air, forming the O coordination around SAs. The site density of O&#8208;Covered Mo&#8208;SAs can be modulated by the dopants of carbon source with different structures and amounts. Such O coordination of Mo&#8208;SAs endows RPCN surface with the enrich electrons under irradiation, promoting the advanced oxidation process with photocatalytic H2O2 decomposition.








Abstract
Coordination environment and site density have great impacts on the catalytic performance for single atoms (SAs). Herein, the site density of Mo&#8208;SAs on red polymeric carbon nitrides (RPCN) is modulated via a local carbonization strategy to controllably catch adventitious O atoms from open environment. The addition of melamine derivants with hydrocarbyl chains induces local carbonization during RPCN pyrolysis. These local carbonization regions bring abundant graphitic N3C to anchor Mo&#8208;SAs, and most of Mo&#8208;SAs catch the O atoms in air, forming the O2&#8208;covered Mo&#8208;N3 coordination. The dopants of carbon source with different structures and amounts can modulate the site density of Mo&#8208;SAs, therefore controlling the amounts of coordinated O atoms. Furthermore, coordinated O atoms around Mo&#8208;SAs construct the catalytic environment with Lewis base and gather photo&#8208;generated electrons under light. Such O&#8208;covered Mo&#8208;SAs endow RPCN materials (Mo&#8208;RPCN) with a strong ability for hydrogen abstraction, leading to the 99.51% ratio (28.8&#160;mmol&#160;min&#8722;1&#160;g&#8722;1) rate for thioanisole conversion with H2O2 assisted advance oxidation technology. This work brings a new sight on the coordinated atoms dominant oxidation process.

         <title>Carbon Nanocage with Maximum Utilization of Atomically Dispersed Iron as Efficient Oxygen Electroreduction Nanoreactor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchical meso&#8208;/microporous N/S co&#8208;doped carbon nanocage with atomically dispersed Fe&#63743;N4 is prepared via nano&#8208;emulsion induced polymerization self&#8208;assembly method, and employed as efficient oxygen electroreduction nanoreactor. The significance of well&#8208;developed nanostructure and porosity toward maximizing utilization of active sites and ensuring fast mass transfer is addressed for highly efficient single&#8208;atom catalyst by systematical experiments and in situ scanning electrochemical microscopy technology.








Abstract
As key parameters of electrocatalysts, the density and utilization of active sites determine the electrocatalytic performance toward oxygen reduction reaction. Unfortunately, prevalent oxygen electrocatalysts fail to maximize the utilization of active sites due to inappropriate nanostructural design. Herein, a nano&#8208;emulsion induced polymerization self&#8208;assembly strategy is employed to prepare hierarchical meso&#8208;/microporous N/S co&#8208;doped carbon nanocage with atomically dispersed Fe&#63743;N4 (denoted as Meso/Micro&#8208;FeNSC). In situ scanning electrochemical microscopy technology reveals the density of available active sites for Meso/Micro&#8208;FeNSC reach to 3.57&#160;&#215;&#160;1014 sites cm&#8722;2, representing more than threefold improvement compared to micropore&#8208;dominant Micro&#8208;FeNSC counterpart (1.07&#160;&#215;&#160;1014 sites cm&#8722;2). Additionally, the turnover frequency of Meso/Micro&#8208;FeNSC is also improved to 0.69 from 0.50 e&#8722; site&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 for Micro&#8208;FeNSC. These properties motivate Meso/Micro&#8208;FeNSC as efficient oxygen electroreduction electrocatalyst, in terms of outstanding half&#8208;wave potential (0.91&#160;V), remarkable kinetic mass specific activity (68.65 A g&#8722;1), and excellent robustness. The assembled Zn&#8211;air batteries with Meso/Micro&#8208;FeNSC deliver high peak power density (264.34&#160;mW cm&#8722;2), large specific capacity (814.09&#160;mA h g&#8722;1), and long cycle life (&gt;200&#160;h). This work sheds lights on quantifying active site density and the significance of maximum utilization of active sites for rational design of advanced catalysts.

         <title>Impermeable Atomic Layer Deposition for Sputtering Buffer Layer in Efficient Semi&#8208;Transparent and Tandem Solar Cells via Activating Unreactive Substrate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The atomic layer deposition (ALD) growth mode on the commonly used electron transportation layer (ETL) PCBM is activated from island growth to layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer growth mode by introducing reaction sites. As a result, the excellent stability, efficient semi&#8208;transparent device, and perovskite/silicon tandem device with reaction sites are available.








Abstract
Atomic layer deposition (ALD) turns out to be particularly attractive technology for the sputtering buffer layer when preparing the semi&#8208;transparent (ST) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and the tandem solar cells. ALD process turns to be island growth when the substrate is unreactive with the ALD reactants, resulting in the pin&#8208;hole layer, which causes an adverse effect on anti&#8208;sputtering. Here, p&#8211;i&#8211;n structured PSCs with ALD SnOx as sputtering buffer layer are conducted. The commonly used electron transportation layer (ETL) PCBM in the p&#8211;i&#8211;n structured PVK solar cell is an unreactive substrate that prevents the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer growth for the ALD SnOx. PCBM layer is activated by introducing reaction sites to form impermeable ALD layers. By introducing reaction sites/ALD SnOx as sputtering buffer layer, the authors succeed to fabricate ST&#8208;PSCs and perovskite/silicon (double&#8208;side polished) tandem solar cells with power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.25% and 23.31%, respectively. Besides, the unencapsulated device with reaction sites maintains more than 99% of the initial PCE after aging over 5100 h. This work opens a promising avenue to prepare impermeable layer for stable PSCs, ST&#8208;PSCs, tandem solar cells, and the related scale&#8208;up solar cells.

Here, p&#8211;i&#8211;n structured PSCs with ALD SnO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; as sputtering buffer layer are conducted. The commonly used electron transportation layer (ETL) PCBM in the p&#8211;i&#8211;n structured PVK solar cell is an unreactive substrate that prevents the layer-by-layer growth for the ALD SnO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;. PCBM layer is activated by introducing reaction sites to form impermeable ALD layers. By introducing reaction sites/ALD SnO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; as sputtering buffer layer, the authors succeed to fabricate ST-PSCs and perovskite/silicon (double-side polished) tandem solar cells with power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.25% and 23.31%, respectively. Besides, the unencapsulated device with reaction sites maintains more than 99% of the initial PCE after aging over 5100 h. This work opens a promising avenue to prepare impermeable layer for stable PSCs, ST-PSCs, tandem solar cells, and the related scale-up solar cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Strategic Synthesis of 2D and&#160;3D Conducting Polymers and Derived Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategic synthesis technique based on a bicontinuous microemulsion system is developed to design nanostructures of conducting polymers including 2D, 3D, and nanocomposites with tailored electrical properties and morphologies.








Abstract
In recent decades, there has been a great deal of interest in conducting polymers due to their broad applications. At the same time, various synthetic techniques have been developed to produce various nanostructures of the conducting polymers with their fascinating properties. However, the techniques for the manufacture of 2D nanosheets are either complex or expensive. No comprehensive approach for constructing 2D and 3D materials or their composites has been documented. Herein, a simple and scalable synthetic protocol is reported for the design of 2D, 3D, and related conducting polymer nanocomposites by interface manipulation in a bicontinuous microemulsion system. In this method, diverse bicontinuous thin layers of oil and water are employed to produce 2D nanosheets of conducting polymers. For the fabrication of 3D polypyrrole (PPY) and their composites, specially designed linkers of the monomers are applied to lock the 3D networks of the conducting polymers and their composites. The technique can be extended to the fabrication of most conducting polymer composites, being cost&#8208;effective and easily scalable. The optimum electrical conductivity obtained for 2D PPY nanosheets is 219&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1, the highest literature value reported to date to the best of knowledge.

         <title>Extracellular Matrix Secretion Mechanically Reinforces Interlocking Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a bioinspired interlocking interface produced by electrostatic flocking. Such an interface can sustain cell growth, and the perpendicularly aligned flocked fibers can mitigate cell death caused by compression. In addition, the secreted extracellular matrix from seeded cells significantly enhances the mechanical properties of the interface.








Abstract
Drawing inspiration for biomaterials from biological systems has led to many biomedical innovations. One notable bioinspired device, Velcro, consists of two substrates with interlocking ability. Generating reversibly interlocking biomaterials is an area of investigation, as such devices can allow for modular tissue engineering, reversibly interlocking biomaterial interfaces, or friction&#8208;based coupling devices. Here, a biaxially interlocking interface generated using electrostatic flocking is reported. Two electrostatically flocked substrates are mechanically and reversibly interlocked with the ability to resist shearing and compression forces. An initial high&#8208;throughput screen of polyamide flock fibers with varying diameters and fiber lengths is conducted to elucidate the roles of different fiber parameters on scaffold mechanical properties. After determining the most desirable parameters via weight scoring, polylactic acid (PLA) fibers are used to emulate the ideal scaffold for in vitro use. PLA flocked scaffolds are populated with osteoblasts and interlocked. Interlocked flocked scaffolds improved cell survivorship under mechanical compression and sustained cell viability and proliferation. Additionally, the compression and shearing resistance of cell&#8208;seeded interlocking interfaces increased with increasing extracellular matrix deposition. The introduction of extracellular matrix&#8208;reinforced interlocking interfaces may serve as binders for modular tissue engineering, act as scaffolds for engineering tissue interfaces, or enable friction&#8208;based couplers for biomedical applications.

         <title>Intrinsic Charge Polarization in Bi19S27Cl3 Nanorods Promotes Selective C&#63743;C Coupling Reaction during Photoreduction of CO2 to Ethanol</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of intrinsic charge polarization has been efficiently exploited for the C&#63743;C coupling reaction. The selected catalyst, Bi19S27Cl3&#160;has three suitably arranged Bi centers with asymmetric charge distribution. The charge polarized Bi centers facilitate the formation of COCOH* intermediate which has been realized as the crucial step for synthesizing ethanol from CO2.








Abstract
Obtaining multi&#8208;carbon products via CO2&#160;photoreduction is a major catalytic challenge involving multielectron&#8208;mediated C&#63743;C bond formation. Complex design of multicomponent interfaces that are exploited to achieve this chemical transformation, often leads to untraceable deleterious changes in the interfacial chemical environment affecting CO2&#160;conversion efficiency and product selectivity. Alternatively, robust metal centers having asymmetric charge distribution can effectuate C&#63743;C coupling reaction through the stabilization of intermediates, for desired product selectivity. However, generating inherent charge distribution in a single component catalyst is a difficult material design challenge. Here, a novel photocatalyst, Bi19S27Cl3, is presented which selectively converts CO2&#160;to a C2&#160;product, ethanol, in high yield under visible light irradiation. Structural analysis through transmission electron microscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy reveals the presence of charge polarized bismuth centers in Bi19S27Cl3. The intrinsic electric field induced by charge polarized bismuth centers renders better separation efficiency of photogenerated electron&#8211;hole pair. Furthermore, charge polarized centers yield better adsorption of CO* intermediate and accelerate the rate determining C&#63743;C coupling step through the formation of OCCOH intermediate. Formation of these intermediates is experimentally mapped by in&#160;situ Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy and further confirmed by theoretical calculation.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Asperities for Pressure&#8208;Tunable Adhesion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Many applications require on&#8208;demand control of adhesion at an interface without significant power consumption. In this work, a new form of adhesive termed &#8220;pressure&#8208;tunable adhesive&#8221; (PTA) is presented. PTAs are elastomeric surfaces patterned with stiff, axisymmetric asperities. The adhesive force of the PTA increases with increasing applied preload. The pressure&#8208;tunable adhesion is demonstrated for pick&#8208;and&#8208;place material handling.








Abstract
Control of adhesion is important in a host of applications including soft robotics, pick&#8208;and&#8208;place manufacturing, wearable devices, and transfer printing. While there are adhesive systems with discrete switchability between states of high and low adhesion, achieving continuously variable adhesion strength remains a challenge. In this work, a pressure&#8208;tunable adhesive (PTA) that is based on the self&#8208;assembly of stiff microscale asperities on an elastomeric substrate is presented. It is demonstrated that the adhesion strength of the PTA increases with the applied compressive preload due to the unique contact formation mechanism caused by the asperities. Additionally, a contact mechanics model is developed to explain the resulting trends. For a specific PTA design, the critical pull&#8208;off force can be increased from 0.4 to 30&#160;mN by increasing the applied preload from 1 to 30&#160;mN. Finally, the applicability of precision control of adhesion strength is demonstrated by utilizing the PTA for pick&#8208;and&#8208;place material handling. The approach in pressure&#8208;tunable adhesive design based on self&#8208;assembly of asperities presents a scalable and versatile approach that is applicable to a variety of material systems having different mechanical or surface properties.

         <title>New Method for Preparing ZnO Layer for Efficient and Stable Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and environmentally friendly method, through boric acid, to remove the residual amine in zinc oxide (ZnO) without decomposing ZnO is reported. Consequently, the optimized tandem organic solar cells (OSCs) output of 19.56% power conversion efficiency and long&#8208;term illumination stability of OSCs are significantly improved.








Abstract
Owing to outstanding optoelectronic properties and simple preparation, zinc oxide (ZnO) has widely been used in organic solar cells (OSCs). Although versatile cathode interface materials have been designed in past, ZnO remains indispensable owing to its excellent overall performance. Therefore, solving the persistent problem of residual amine reacting with non&#8208;fullerene acceptors will make ZnO superior over other materials, and thus improve the performance and energy budget of OSCs. Herein, a simple, effective, and economical method for removing residual amine in ZnO without distorting ZnO is reported. By accurately comparing the alkalinities of ZnO and residual amine, boric acid (BA) is selected as the amine&#8208;removing agent because of its suitable acidic dissociation constant. Moreover, the high water solubility of BA ensures that the post&#8208;cleaning process can be easily performed. The work function, electron extraction, and stability of cathode interface layer are optimized through rinsing them with BA. Consequently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of OSCs under long&#8208;term illumination are significantly improved. The optimal 0.04&#160;and 1.00&#160;cm2&#160;single&#8208;junction OSCs are based on PBDB&#8208;TF:HDO&#8208;4Cl:BTP&#8208;eC9&#160;bulk heterojunction output 18.40% and 17.42% efficiencies, respectively. Furthermore, tandem OSCs based on the BA&#8208;treated ZnO exhibit a 19.56% PCE, demonstrating the reliability of this method.

         <title>Manipulating the Formation of 2D/3D Heterostructure in Stable High&#8208;Performance Printable CsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ X&#8208;ray scattering is applied to investigate the structure evolution pathway of the 2D phase atop 3D perovskite. By manipulating the phase transition pathway, the gradient distribution from 3D to n&#160;= 2 and n&#160;= 1 phase is realized in final films which helps charge separation and extraction, finally concurrently boosted the device stability and efficiency.








Abstract
Manipulating the formation process of the 2D/3D perovskite heterostructure, including its nucleation/growth dynamics and phase transition pathway, plays a critical role in controlling the charge transport between 2D and 3D crystals, and consequently, the scalable fabrication of efficient and stable perovskite solar cells. Herein, the structural evolution and phase transition pathways of the ligand&#8208;dependent 2D perovskite atop the 3D surface are revealed using time&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray scattering. The results show that the ligand size and shape have a critical influence on the final 2D structure. In particular, ligands with smaller sizes and more reactive sites tend to form the n&#160;= 1 phase. Increasing the ligand size and decreasing the reactive sites promote the transformation from 3D to n&#160;= 3 and n&#160;&lt; 3 phases. These findings are useful for the rational design of the phase distribution in 2D perovskites to balance the charge transport and stability of the perovskite films. Finally, solar cells based on ambient&#8208;printed CsPbI3 with n&#8208;butylammonium iodide treatment achieve an improved efficiency of 20.33%, which is the highest reported value for printed inorganic perovskite solar cells.

         <title>Chiral&#8208;Selective Antigen&#8208;Presentation by Supramolecular Chiral Polymer Micelles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral polymer micelles are prepared by complexing antigens with chiral amino acid modified polyethyleneimine. D&#8208;chiral micelles present the lowest cytotoxicity while promoting the highest activation levels of dendritic cells and antigen&#8208;specific cytotoxic T cells compared to those of L&#8208;chiral and achiral micelles. Immunoactivation mediated by D&#8208;chirality opens a window to prepare potent nanotherapeutics for disease prevention and treatment.








Abstract
Chirality is ubiquitous in biological systems, which is closely related to biological functions, life processes, and even the pathogenesis of diseases. However, the interface between the chirality of synthetic materials and organisms, particularly the immune system, remains poorly understood. Here, supramolecular chiral polymer micelles (SCPMs) are prepared by complexing antigenic proteins with chiral amino acid&#8208;modified polyethyleneimine. The introduction of chirality not only reduces the toxicity of cationic polymer, but also benefits cell uptake and antigen presentation. Especially, D&#8208;chirality presents the lowest cytotoxicity, while promoting the highest expression level of costimulatory molecules on dendritic cells compared to L&#8208;chirality and achirality. The superiority of D&#8208;chirality to stimulate dendritic cell maturation is supported by immunization with D&#8208;SCPMs, which achieves significant antigen&#8208;specific proliferation of T cells in the spleen, lymph nodes, and tumor of mice. Chirality&#8208;mediated antigen processing and presentation are demonstrated by D&#8208;SCPMs self&#8208;assembled from chiral alkaline histidine or neutral phenylalanine modified polyethyleneimine and tumor associated ovalbumin or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 spike 1 antigenic protein. Immunoactivation enabled by D&#8208;chirality opens a window to prepare potent nanotherapeutics for disease prevention and treatment.

         <title>A Molecularly Tailored Photosensitizer with an Efficiency of 13.2% for Dye&#8208;Sensitized Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>

Dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;d]pyrrole (DTP) is demonstrated as an efficient &#960;&#8208;linker for copper&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;based dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells. Endowed with the hexyloxy&#8208;substituted diphenylquinoxaline (HPQ) acceptor, ZS4 shows more efficient electron injection and charge collection based on substantially reduced interfacial charge recombination, yielding a record power conversion efficiency of 13.2% and an outstanding stability under continuous light soaking for 1000&#160;h.








Abstract
Photosensitizers yielding superior photocurrents are crucial for copper&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;based highly efficient dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells (DSCs). Herein, two molecularly tailored organic sensitizers are presented, coded ZS4 and ZS5, through judiciously employing dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8243;,3&#8243;&#8208;d]pyrrole (DTP) as the &#960;&#8208;linker and hexyloxy&#8208;substituted diphenylquinoxaline (HPQ) or naphthalene&#8208;fused&#8208;quinoxaline (NFQ) as the auxiliary electron&#8208;accepting unit, respectively. Endowed with the HPQ acceptor, ZS4 shows more efficient electron injection and charge collection based on substantially reduced interfacial charge recombination as compared to ZS5. As a result, ZS4&#8208;based DSCs achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.2% under standard AM1.5G sunlight, with a high short&#8208;circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 16.3&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, an open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.05&#160;V and a fill factor (FF) of 77.1%. Remarkably, DSCs sensitized with ZS4 exhibit an outstanding stability, retaining 95% of their initial PCE under continuous light soaking for 1000&#160;h. It is believed that&#160;this is a new record efficiency reported so far for copper&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;based DSCs using a single sensitizer. The work highlights the importance of developing molecularly tailored photosensitizers for highly efficient DSCs with copper electrolyte.

         <title>Sulfonium&#8208;Cations&#8208;Assisted Intermediate Engineering for Quasi&#8208;2D Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
The effects of sulfonium cation on the evolution of intermediates in quasi&#8208;2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskites are investigated. It is found that the undesired intermediate can be suppressed with a favorable intermediate promoted after treatment, leading to improved film quality and enhanced device performance with superior photovoltaic efficiency and stability.








Abstract
Quasi&#8208;2D&#160;Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) perovskites with superior stability are admirable candidates for perovskite solar cells (PSCs) toward commercialization. However, the device performance remains unsatisfactory due to the disordered crystallization of perovskites. In this work, the effects of sulfonium cations on the evolution of intermediates and photovoltaic properties of 2D RP perovskites are investigated. The introduction of sulfonium cations leads to preferred intermediate transformation and improved film quality of perovskites. The resulting devices deliver a champion efficiency of 19.08% at room temperature and 20.52% at 180&#160;K, due to reduced recombination and enhanced charge transport. More importantly, the unencapsulated device maintains 84% of the initial efficiency under maximum power point (MPP) tracking at 40&#160;&#176;C for 1000&#160;h. This work helps to gain a comprehensive understanding of the crystallization process of quasi&#8208;2D perovskites and provides a simple strategy to modulate the intermediates of perovskites.

         <title>Discovery of Type II Interlayer Trions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first observation of Type II interlayer trions by exploring band alignments and choosing an atomically thin organic&#8211;inorganic system&#8208;monolayer WSe2/bilayer pentacene heterostructure is reported. Both positive and negative Type II interlayer trions are electrically tuned. In particular, Type II interlayer trions exhibit in&#8208;plane anisotropic emission, possibly caused by their unique spatial structure and anisotropic charge interactions.








Abstract
In terms of interlayer trions, electronic excitations in van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) can be classified into Type I (i.e., two identical charges in the same layer) and Type II (i.e., two identical charges in the different layers). Type I interlayer trions are investigated theoretically and experimentally. By contrast, Type II interlayer trions remain elusive in vdWHs, due to inadequate free charges, unsuitable band alignment, reduced Coulomb interactions, poor interface quality, etc. Here, the first observation of Type II interlayer trions is reported by exploring band alignments and choosing an atomically thin organic&#8211;inorganic system&#8212;monolayer WSe2/bilayer pentacene heterostructure (1L&#160;+&#160;2L HS). Both positive and negative Type II interlayer trions are electrically tuned and observed via PL spectroscopy. In particular, Type II interlayer trions exhibit in&#8208;plane anisotropic emission, possibly caused by their unique spatial structure and anisotropic charge interactions, which is highly correlated with the transition dipole moment of pentacene. The results pave the way to develop excitonic devices and all&#8208;optical circuits using atomically thin organic&#8211;inorganic bilayers.

         <title>Ultrastable Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C Fuel Cell Electrocatalysts by Eliminating Non&#8208;Coordinating Nitrogen and Regulating Coordination Structures at High Temperatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrastable Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C electrocatalyst for the oxygen electroreduction in proton exchange membrane fuel cells is developed by virtue of high&#8208;temperature pyrolysis chemistry at above 1100&#160;&#176;C, which enables the regulation of atomic coordination structures of Fe centers and the elimination of non&#8208;coordinating nitrogen dopants producing detrimental peroxide byproduct.








Abstract
Pyrolyzed Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C materials have attracted considerable interest as one of the most active noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Despite significant progress is made in improving their catalytic activity during past decades, the Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts still suffer from fairly poor electrochemical and storage stability, which greatly hurdles their practical application. Here, an effective strategy is developed to greatly improve their catalytic stability in PEMFCs and storage stability by virtue of previously unexplored high&#8208;temperature synthetic chemistry between 1100 and 1200&#160;&#176;C. Pyrolysis at this rarely adopted temperature range not only enables the elimination of less active nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon sites that generate detrimental peroxide byproduct but also regulates the coordination structure of Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C from less stable D1 (O&#8211;FeN4C12) to a more stable D2 structure (FeN4C10). The optimized Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst exhibits excellent stability in PEMFCs (&gt;80% performance retention after 30&#160;h under H2/O2 condition) and no activity loss after 35 day storage while maintaining a competitive ORR activity and PEMFC performance.

         <title>Controlled Desiccation of Preprinted Hydrogel Scaffolds Toward Complex 3D Microarchitectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By printing highly shrinkable hydrogel scaffolds as templates via a low&#8208;resolution extrusion 3D printer, complex 3D architectures with micron&#8208;level resolution are successfully fabricated. This technique is capable of manufacturing a wider range of material types and reveals the opportunity for hydrogel to assist 3D microfabrication.








Abstract
Additive manufacturing (AM) is the key to creating a wide variety of 3D structures with unique and programmable functionalities. Direct ink writing is one of the widely used AM technologies with numerous printable materials. However, the extrude&#8208;based method is limited by low fabrication resolution, which is confined to printing macrostructures. Herein, a new AM strategy is reported, using a low&#8208;cost extrusion 3D printer, to create 3D microarchitectures at the macroscopic level through controlled desiccation of preprinted hydrogel scaffolds followed by infilling objective components. A printable hydrogel with a high&#8208;water content ensures maximum shrinkage (&#8776;99.5% in volume) of the printed scaffolds to achieve high resolution. Stable covalent cross&#8208;linking and a suitable drying rate enable uniform shrinkage of the scaffolds to retain their original architectures. Particularly, this method can be adapted to produce liquid&#8208;metal&#8208;based 3D circuits and nanocomposite&#8208;based microrobots, indicating its capability to fabricate functional and complex 3D architectures with micron&#8208;level resolution from different material systems.

         <title>Hofmeister Effect&#8208;Enhanced Hydration Chemistry of Hydrogel for High&#8208;Efficiency Solar&#8208;Driven Interfacial Desalination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid hydrogel (PMH) judiciously integrated by modified needle coke as solar absorber with polyvinyl alcohol as hydratable matrix and its implementation as evaporator for solar desalination are reported. The Hofmeister chaotropic ions can interfere hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks of PMH and strengthen corresponding hydration chemistry, thus delivering a lowered water vaporization enthalpy and an elevated evaporation performance of PMH in brine.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven water evaporation technology holds great potential for mitigating the global water scarcity due to its high energy conversion efficiency. Lowering the vaporization enthalpy of water is key to boost the performance of solar&#8208;driven desalination. Herein, a highly hydratable hydrogel (PMH) network, consisting of modified needle coke as photothermal material and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as hydratable matrix, is crafted via simple physical cross&#8208;linking method. When capitalizing on the PMH as evaporator for 3.5&#160;wt% NaCl solution, a high evaporation rate of 3.18&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;under one sun illumination is deliver ed, unexpectedly outperforming that in pure water (2.53&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1). More importantly, the PMH shows a robust desalination durability, thus enabling a self&#8208;cleaning system. Further investigations reveal that the outstanding evaporation performance of PMH in brine roots in its hydrability tuned by chaotropic Cl&#8722;, wherein the Cl&#8722; can mediate the hydration chemistry of PVA in PMH and suppress related crystallinity, thus contributing to the increased content of intermediate water and the lowered vaporization enthalpy of brine. This work first scrutinizes the Hofmeister effect on the evaporation behavior of PMH evaporator in brine and provides insights for high&#8208;efficiency solar&#8208;driven interfacial desalination.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solar-driven water evaporation technology holds great potential for mitigating the global water scarcity due to its high energy conversion efficiency. Lowering the vaporization enthalpy of water is key to boost the performance of solar-driven desalination. Herein, a highly hydratable hydrogel (PMH) network, consisting of modified needle coke as photothermal material and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as hydratable matrix, is crafted via simple physical cross-linking method. When capitalizing on the PMH as evaporator for 3.5&#160;wt% NaCl solution, a high evaporation rate of 3.18&#160;kg&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;under one sun illumination is deliver ed, unexpectedly outperforming that in pure water (2.53&#160;kg&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). More importantly, the PMH shows a robust desalination durability, thus enabling a self-cleaning system. Further investigations reveal that the outstanding evaporation performance of PMH in brine roots in its hydrability tuned by chaotropic Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, wherein the Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; can mediate the hydration chemistry of PVA in PMH and suppress related crystallinity, thus contributing to the increased content of intermediate water and the lowered vaporization enthalpy of brine. This work first scrutinizes the Hofmeister effect on the evaporation behavior of PMH evaporator in brine and provides insights for high-efficiency solar-driven interfacial desalination.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Intrinsic Interfacial Dynamic Engineering of Zincophilic Microbrushes via Regulating Zn Deposition for Highly Reversible Aqueous Zinc Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel structural and chemical design is proposed to anchor zincophilic microbrushes uniformly on zinc plates. By the interfacial engineering of guiding layer, zinc ion deposition is efficiently regulated, resulting in suppressed dendrite formation and hindered side reactions. These rational coverings consequently lead to satisfactory anode stability for aqueous zinc ion battery.








Abstract
Aqueous rechargeable zinc ion batteries are promising efficient energy storage systems due to remarkable safety and satisfactory capacity. However, zinc metal anode instability including dendrite growth and side reactions severely hinders widespread applications. Herein, zincophilic microbrushes have been in situ anchored on zinc plates through simple freeze&#8208;drying and mild reduction of graphene oxide, successfully overcoming these thorny issues. By introducing suitable oxygen&#8208;containing groups, the microbrushes exhibit a good affinity for zinc ions, thereby providing sufficient depositing sites, promoting zinc plating and stripping during cycling, and suppressing side reactions. The delicate zincophilic microbrushes can not only function as protective layer to guide the deposition of zinc ions, but also act as high&#8208;speed pathways to redistribute the zinc ion flux for rapid kinetics. Consequently, the microbrushes&#8208;covered zinc anode displays long lifespan and good durability, whenever in symmetric cell or full battery tests. This work paves a feasible bridge to design advanced aqueous anodes by architecting both structures and compositions of metal coverings.

         <title>Janus Microdroplets with Tunable Self&#8208;Recoverable and Switchable Reflective Structural Colors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Janus microdroplets consisting of chiral nematic liquid crystals and silicone oil are synthesized, showing a large area of reflective colors compared with the spherical microdroplets. The reflective colors can be tuned by the chiral dopant concentration, the viewing angle, and magnetic field&#8208;responsive orientation of the droplets. Their suspension can be applied to&#160;self&#8208;recoverable displays, magnetic tracking, and data encryption.








Abstract
Microdroplets made from chiral liquid crystals (CLCs) can display reflective structural colors. However, the small area of reflection and their isotropic shape limit their performance. Here, Janus microdroplets are synthesized through phase separation between CLCs and silicone oil. The as&#8208;synthesized Janus microdroplets show primary structural colors with &#8776;14 times larger area compared to their spherical counterparts at a specific orientation; the orientation and thus the colored/transparent states can be switched by applying a magnetic field. The color of the Janus microdroplets can be tuned ranging from red to violet by varying the concentration of the chiral dopant in the CLC phase. Due to the density difference between the two phases, the Janus microdroplets prefer to orientate the silicone oil side up vertically, enabling the self&#8208;recoverable structural color after distortion. The Janus microdroplets can be dispersed in aqueous media to track the configuration and speed of magnetic objects. They can also be patterned as multiplexed labels for data encryption. The magnetic field&#8208;responsive Janus CLC microdroplets presented here offer new insights to generate and switch reflective colors with high color saturation. It also paves the way for broader applications of CLCs, including anti&#8208;counterfeiting, data encryption, display, and untethered speed sensors.

Abstract
Chiral carbon dots (Ch&#8208;CDs) trigger the full&#8208;color circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) of CsPbX3&#160;nanocrystals (NCs). Ch&#8208;CDs&#8208;CsPbBr3&#160;NCs are successfully synthesized via simple ligand&#8208;assisted coprecipitation of Ch&#8208;CDs and metal halides precursors at room temperature. Ch&#8208;CDs&#8208;CsPbBr3&#160;retains emission characteristics of the CsPbBr3&#160;with near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield, and meanwhile has special CPL, with a maximum luminescence dissymmetric factor (glum) of &#8722;3.1&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3, which is induced by Ch&#8208;CDs. This is the first report of chiral perovskite which is induced by other chiral nanomaterials. By anion exchange, CPL can cover almost the entire visible light band. Surprisingly, the chiral signal of Ch&#8208;CDs&#8208;CsPbBr3&#160;NCs is in&#8208;versed under excitation state, which can be induced by the charge transfers between Ch&#8208;CDs and perovskite NCs. The combination of perovskites and Ch&#8208;CDs pave away for the design of new chiral perovskite on multifunctional applications.

         <title>Long&#8208;Life Regenerated LiFePO4 from Spent Cathode by Elevating the d&#8208;Band Center of Fe</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe&#63743;O bonding is strengthened by elevating the d&#8208;band center of Fe in regenerated LiFePO4 (RSLFP@NC), which effectively restrains Fe migration and the formation of antisite defects during cycling. Therefore, the regenerated LFP shows excellent cycling performance with &#8776;80% retention after 1000&#160;cycles, which is better than the cycling performance of pristine LiFePO4.








Abstract
A large amount of spent LiFePO4 (LFP) has been produced in recent years because it is one of the most widely used cathode materials for electric vehicles. The traditional hydrometallurgical and pyrometallurgical recycling methods are doubted because of the economic and environmental benefits; the direct regeneration method is considered a promising way to recycle spent LFP. However, the performance of regenerated LFP by direct recycling is not ideal due to the migration of Fe ions during cycling and irreversible phase transition caused by sluggish Li+ diffusion. The key to addressing the challenge is to immobilize Fe atoms in the lattice and improve the Li+ migration capability during cycling. In this work, spent LFP is regenerated by using environmentally friendly ethanol, and its cycling stability is promoted by elevating the d&#8208;band center of Fe atoms via construction of a heterogeneous interface between LFP and nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon. The Fe&#63743;O bonding is strengthened and the migration of Fe ions during cycling is suppressed due to the elevated d&#8208;band center. The Li+ diffusion kinetics in the regenerated LFP are improved, leading to an excellent reversibility of the phase transition. Therefore, &#160;the regenerated LFP exhibits an ultrastable cycling performance at a high rate of 10&#160;C with &#8776;80% capacity retention after 1000&#160;cycles.

Perovskite Solar Cells
In article 2208061, Lukas E. Lehner, Martin Kaltenbrunner, and co&#8208;workers report the controlled nucleation of quasi&#8208;2D perovskites at the liquid&#8211;air interface of the precursor solution. Restricting the initial crystal growth to the surface of the liquid results in highly aligned perovskite thin films with improved charge transport, enabling efficient solar cells with excellent stability.

All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries
The application of a lithium&#8208;rich layered oxide (LLO) cathode in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) has been hampered by its low electronic conductivity and the high reactivity of its lattice oxygen. In article number 2207234, Ruizhi Yu, Jiantao Wang, Xifei Li, Chandra Veer Singh, Xueliang Sun, and co&#8208;workers successfully address this by introducing an appropriate amount of conductive additives to the solid&#8208;state electrodes and manipulating the surface chemistry, realizing long&#8208;cycle&#8208;life LLO&#8208;based ASSBs.

Cathode Materials
The cycling performance of regenerated LiFePO4 by the direct recycling method is generally not ideal due to the migration of iron (Fe) ions during cycling. In article number 2208034, Zheng Liang, Guangmin Zhou, Hui&#8208;Ming Cheng, and co&#8208;workers report long&#8208;life regenerated LiFePO4 from the spent cathode. Fe&#8211;O bonding is strengthened and the migration of Fe ions is suppressed by elevating the d&#8208;band center of the Fe. Therefore, excellent cycle performance of LiFePO4 is realized and this strategy provides a guideline for achieving good performance of regenerated LiFePO4.

In article number 2207337, Chelsea Davis and co&#8208;workers show that pressure&#8208;tunable adhesives (PTAs) demonstrate variable adhesive separation forces depending on the application pressure used to form the interface. PTAs are formed by annealing a polymer film on a silicone surface so that it dewets, forming polygonal clusters. The large gray circle is the flat face of a cylindrical probe about to make contact with the PTA during a probe&#8208;tack adhesion experiment.

Despite recent rapid growth, traditional synthetic approaches to quantum materials have limited architectural control beyond the atomic scale. By contrast, soft matter self&#8208;assembly can tailor structures over a wide range of length scales. This review explores opportunities for soft matter to impact quantum material synthesis, highlighting existing work at the interface, and offering perspectives on soft&#8208;matter&#8208;enabled quantum materials.








Abstract
The field of quantum materials has experienced rapid growth over the past decade, driven by exciting new discoveries with immense transformative potential. Traditional synthetic methods to quantum materials have, however, limited the exploration of architectural control beyond the atomic scale. By contrast, soft matter self&#8208;assembly can be used to tailor material structure over a large range of length scales, with a vast array of possible form factors, promising emerging quantum material properties at the mesoscale. This review explores opportunities for soft matter science to impact the synthesis of quantum materials with advanced properties. Existing work at the interface of these two fields is highlighted, and perspectives are provided on possible future directions by discussing the potential benefits and challenges which can arise from their bridging.

         <title>Block Copolymer Self&#8208;Assembly Directed Synthesis of Porous Materials with Ordered Bicontinuous Structures and Their Potential Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article overviews the progress of the studies on block copolymer self&#8208;assembly guided synthesis of bicontinuous porous materials, with the emphases on their synthetic strategies, structural control, and potential applications in energy storage and conversion, metamaterials, photonic crystals, cargo delivery and release, nanoreactors, and biomolecule selection.








Abstract
Porous materials with their ordered bicontinuous structures have attracted great interest owing to ordered periodic structures as well as 3D interconnected network and pore channels. Bicontinuous structures may favor efficient mass diffusion to the interior of materials, thus increasing the utilization ratio of active sites. In addition, ordered bicontinuous structures confer materials with exceptional optical and magnetic properties, including tunable photonic bandgap, negative refraction, and multiple equivalent magnetization configurations. The attractive structural advantages and physical properties have inspired people to develop strategies for preparing bicontinuous&#8208;structured porous materials. Among a few synthetic approaches, the self&#8208;assembly of block copolymers represents a versatile strategy to prepare various bicontinuous&#8208;structured functional materials with pore sizes and lattice parameters ranging from 1 to 500&#160;nm. This article overviews progress in this appealing area, with an emphasis on the synthetic strategies, the structural control (including topologies, pore sizes, and unit cell parameters), and their potential applications in energy storage and conversion, metamaterials, photonic crystals, cargo delivery and release, nanoreactors, and biomolecule selection.

         <title>Pivotal Routes for Maximizing Semitransparent Perovskite Solar Cell Performance: Photon Propagation Management and Carrier Kinetics Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematic understanding of the mechanism of photon propagation and carrier kinetics of semitransparent perovskite solar cells (ST&#8208;PSCs) is critical for the development of high&#8208;performance ST&#8208;PSCs. In this paper, the key factors affecting the high light utilization of ST&#8208;PSCs are deeply discussed from the theoretical analysis, and the recent advances from the view of photon propagation management and carrier kinetics regulation of ST&#8208;PSCs are summarized, which provides guidance for promoting the rapid development and further commercialization of ST&#8208;PSCs.








Abstract
Semitransparent perovskite solar cells (ST&#8208;PSCs) are ideal candidates for building&#8208;integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) and tandem solar cells (TSCs) owing to their tunable bandgap and high visible transparency. The best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ST&#8208;PSCs is close to 15% with an average visible transmittance of over 20%, which still lags far behind the PCE of normal opaque PSCs. This can be attributed to the poor light utilization efficiency (LUE) of ST&#8208;PSCs. Herein, the pivotal routes for maximizing LUE of ST&#8208;PSCs in terms of photon propagation management and carrier kinetics regulation are systematically rationalized. First, the fundamental theoretical analyses on optical processes and electronic properties are provided. Then, insights on photon propagation management measures and carrier kinetics regulation strategies are provided. Furthermore, a summary of the promising commercial application of ST&#8208;PSCs in BIPV and TSCs is provided. Finally, the main progress of ST&#8208;PSCs is briefly summarized, and the directions for the commercialization of ST&#8208;PSCs are proposed.

         <title>Toward Plasmonic Neural Probes: SERS Detection of Neurotransmitters through Gold&#8208;Nanoislands&#8208;Decorated Tapered Optical Fibers with Sub&#8208;10&#160;nm Gaps</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy based neural probe that can detect neurotransmitters down to the micromolar range is presented. Striving for the development of minimally invasive neuroplasmonic probes providing highly sensitive biomolecular detection in the deep brain regions, a nonplanar repeated dewetting technique to fabricate gold nanoislands with sub&#8208;10 nm gaps around the entire tapered optical fiber surface is introduced.








Abstract
Integration of plasmonic nanostructures with fiber&#8208;optics&#8208;based neural probes enables label&#8208;free detection of molecular fingerprints via surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), and it represents a fascinating technological horizon to investigate brain function. However, developing neuroplasmonic probes that can interface with deep brain regions with minimal invasiveness while providing the sensitivity to detect biomolecular signatures in a physiological environment is challenging, in particular because the same waveguide must be employed for both delivering excitation light and collecting the resulting scattered photons. Here, a SERS&#8208;active neural probe based on a tapered optical fiber (TF) decorated with gold nanoislands (NIs) that can detect neurotransmitters down to the micromolar range is presented. To do this, a novel, nonplanar repeated dewetting technique to fabricate gold NIs with sub&#8208;10&#160;nm gaps, uniformly distributed on the wide (square millimeter scale in surface area), highly curved surface of TF is developed. It is experimentally and numerically shown&#160;that the amplified broadband near&#8208;field enhancement of the high&#8208;density NIs layer allows for achieving a limit of detection in aqueous solution of 10&#8722;7&#160;m for rhodamine 6G and 10&#8722;5&#160;m for serotonin and dopamine through SERS at near&#8208;infrared wavelengths. The NIs&#8208;TF technology is envisioned as a first step toward the unexplored frontier of in vivo label&#8208;free plasmonic neural interfaces.

         <title>Effects of Multiple Ion Reactions based on a CoSe2/MXene Cathode in Aluminum&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

Abstract
Rechargeable aluminum ion batteries have emerged as a promising battery storage technology owing to their cost&#8208;effectiveness, operational safety, and high energy density. However, their actual capacity is substantially lower than their true capacity and their cycling stability is poor. Therefore, unerstanding the energy&#8208;storage mechanism may contribute to the successful design of a stable electrode material, on which the performance can be optimized. The aim of this study w as to investigate AlCl4&#8722; ions in transition metal cathode materials and mechanisms that enable for their high energy storage potential and low Coulombic efficiency.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rechargeable aluminum ion batteries have emerged as a promising battery storage technology owing to their cost-effectiveness, operational safety, and high energy density. However, their actual capacity is substantially lower than their true capacity and their cycling stability is poor. Therefore, unerstanding the energy-storage mechanism may contribute to the successful design of a stable electrode material, on which the performance can be optimized. The aim of this study w as to investigate AlCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ions in transition metal cathode materials and mechanisms that enable for their high energy storage potential and low Coulombic efficiency. Results of theoretical analysis and experimental verification show that a multi-ion transport mechanism is responsible for the electrochemical behavior of the battery. The lattice distortion of CoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; caused by AlCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

         <title>Reviving Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysis of Bulk La&#8211;Ni Intermetallics via Gaseous Hydrogen Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrogen processing strategy is utilized to optimize the microstructure of bulk LaNi5 to activate its alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER)&#160;performance. Furthermore, the phase evolution, as well as the role of La during the OER process, is unequivocally decoupled. Hydrogen storage, hydrogen production, and hydrogen application are integrated toward the development of the hydrogen economy.








Abstract
A hydrogen processing strategy is developed to enable bulk LaNi5 to attain high activity and long&#8208;term stability toward the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). By a combination of in situ Raman and quasi in situ X&#8208;ray absorption (XAS) spectra, secondary&#8208;electron&#8208;excited scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) patterns as well as the Rietveld method and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, it is discovered that hydrogen&#8208;induced lattice distortion, grain refinement, and particle cracks dictate the effective reconstruction of the LaNi5 surface into a porous hetero&#8208;nanoarchitecture composed of uniformly confined active &#947;&#8208;NiOOH nanocrystals by La(OH)3 layer in the alkaline OER process. This significantly optimizes the charge transfer, structural integrity, active&#8208;site exposure, and adsorption energy toward the reaction intermediates. Benefiting from these merits, the overpotential (322&#160;mV) at 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for the hydrogen&#8208;processed OER catalyst deposited on nickel foam is reduced by 104&#160;mV as compared to the original phase. Notably, it exhibits remarkable stability for 10 days at an industrial&#8208;grade current density of more than 560&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in alkaline media.

         <title>Actively Triggerable Metals via Liquid Metal Embrittlement for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Actively triggerable metals for biomedical applications combine the advantageous functional properties of metals with precise lifetime control. In this work, a biocompatible liquid metal is formulated into stimuli that can successfully trigger the on&#8208;demand and programmable breakdown of aluminum within different physiologically relevant environments. Additionally, three use cases for actively triggerable metals in biomedical devices are presented.








Abstract
Actively triggerable materials, which break down upon introduction of an exogenous stimulus, enable precise control over the lifetime of biomedical technologies, as well as adaptation to unforeseen circumstances, such as changes to an established treatment plan. Yet, most actively triggerable materials are low&#8208;strength polymers and hydrogels with limited long&#8208;term durability. By contrast, metals possess advantageous functional properties, including high mechanical strength and conductivity, that are desirable across several applications within biomedicine. To realize actively triggerable metals, a mechanism called liquid metal embrittlement is leveraged, in which certain liquid metals penetrate the grain boundaries of certain solid metals and cause them to dramatically weaken or disintegrate. In this work, it is demonstrated that eutectic gallium indium (EGaIn), a biocompatible alloy of gallium, can be formulated to reproducibly trigger the breakdown of aluminum within different physiologically relevant environments. The breakdown behavior of aluminum after triggering can further be readily controlled by manipulating its grain structure. Finally, three possible use cases of biomedical devices constructed from actively triggerable metals are demonstrated.

         <title>Graphdiyne and Its Derivatives as Efficient Charge Reservoirs and Transporters in Semiconductor Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) graphdiyne (GDY), which is composed of sp and sp2 hybridized carbon atoms, is a promising semiconductor material with a unique porous lamellar structure. It has high carrier mobility, tunable bandgap, high density of states, and strong electrostatic interaction ability with ions and organic functional units. In recent years, interests in applying GDYs (GDY and its derivatives) in semiconductor devices are rapidly growing, and great achievements have been made. Attractively, GDYs could act as efficient reservoirs and transporters for both carriers and ions, which endows them with enormous potential in future novel optoelectronics. In this review, the progress in this field is systematically summarized, aiming to bring an in&#8208;depth insight into the GDYs&#8217; intrinsic uniqueness. Particularly, the effects of GDYs on carrier dynamics and ionic interactions in various semiconductor devices are succinctly described, analyzed, and concluded.

         <title>Enzymatically Crosslinked Collagen as Versatile Matrix for In Vitro and In Vivo Co&#8208;Engineering of Blood and Lymphatic Vasculature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Adequate vascularization is required for the successful translation of many in vitro engineered tissues. This study presents a novel collagen derivative that harbors multiple recognition peptides for orthogonal enzymatic crosslinking based on sortase A and Factor XIII. Sortase A&#8208;mediated crosslinking enables the rapid co&#8208;engineering of human blood and lymphatic microcapillaries and mesoscale capillaries in bulk hydrogels. Whereas tuning of gel stiffness determines the extent of neovascularization, the relative number of blood and lymphatic capillaries recapitulates the ratio of blood and lymphatic endothelial cells originally seeded into the hydrogel. Bioengineered capillaries readily form luminal structures and exhibit typical maturation markers both in vitro and in vivo. The secondary crosslinking enzyme Factor XIII is used for in situ tethering of the VEGF mimetic QK peptide to collagen. This approach supports the formation of blood and lymphatic capillaries in the absence of exogenous VEGF. Orthogonal enzymatic crosslinking is further used to bioengineer hydrogels with spatially defined polymer compositions with pro&#8208; and anti&#8208;angiogenic properties. Finally, macroporous scaffolds based on secondary crosslinking of microgels enable vascularization independent from supporting fibroblasts. Overall, this work demonstrates for the first time the co&#8208;engineering of mature micro&#8208; and meso&#8208;sized blood and lymphatic capillaries using a highly versatile collagen derivative.

         <title>Near Zero&#8208;threshold Voltage P&#8208;N Junction Diodes Based on Super&#8208;semiconducting Nanostructured Ag/Al Arrays</title>

Abstract
Semiconductor devices are currently one of the most common energy consumption devices. Significantly reducing the energy consumption of semiconductor devices with advanced energy&#8208;efficient technologies is highly desirable. The discovery of super&#8208;semiconductors (SSCs) based on metallic bi&#8208;layer shell arrays provides an opportunity to realize ultra&#8208;low&#8208;power consumption semiconductors devices. As an example, we report the achievement of near zero&#8208;threshold voltage in p&#8208;n junction diodes based on super&#8208;semiconducting nanostructured Ag/Al arrays, realizing ultra&#8208;low&#8208;power p&#8208;n junction diodes: &#8764; 3&#160;W per trillion diodes with a working voltage of 1&#160;V, or 30&#160;mW per trillion diodes with an operating voltage of 0.1&#160;V. In addition, the p&#8208;n junction diodes exhibit a high breakdown field of &#8764; 1.1&#215;106&#160;V/cm, similar to that of SiC and GaN, due to a robust built&#8208;in field driven by infrared light photons. The SSC p&#8208;n diodes with near zero&#8208;threshold&#160;voltage and high breakdown field allow access to ultra&#8208;low&#8208;power semiconducting transistors, integrated circuits, chips, etc.

         <title>An Efficient High&#8208;entropy Perovskite&#8208;type Air Electrode for Reversible Oxygen Reduction and Water Splitting in Protonic Ceramic Cells</title>

Abstract
Reversible protonic ceramic electrochemical cells (R&#8208;PCECs) are emerging as ideal devices for highly efficient energy conversion (generating electricity) and storage (producing H2) at intermediate temperatures (400&#8208;700&#176;C). However, their commercialization is largely hindered by the development of highly efficient air electrodes for oxygen reduction and water&#8208;splitting reactions. Here we report our findings in the design of a highly active and durable air electrode: high&#8208;entropy Pr0.2Ba0.2Sr0.2La0.2Ca0.2CoO3&#8208;&#948; (HE&#8208;PBSLCC), which exhibits impressive activity and stability for oxygen reduction and water&#8208;splitting reactions, as confirmed by electrochemical characterizations and structural analyses. When used as an air electrode of R&#8208;PCEC, the HE&#8208;PBSLCC achieves encouraging performances in dual modes of fuel cells (FC) and electrolysis cells (EC) at 650&#176;C, demonstrating a maximum power density of 1.51 W cm&#8722;2 in FC mode, and a current density of &#8208;2.68 A cm&#8722;2 at 1.3 V in EC mode. Furthermore, the cells display good operational durabilities in FC and EC modes for over 270 h and 500 h, respectively, and promising cycling durability for 70 h with reasonable Faradaic efficiencies. This study offers an effective strategy for the design of active and durable air electrodes for efficient oxygen reduction and water&#8208;splitting.

         <title>Effect of Phosphorus Modulation in Iron Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Peroxidase Mimicking</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) exhibit excellent peroxidase (POD)&#8208;like catalytic activity, owing to their well&#8208;defined isolated iron active sites on the carbon substrate, which effectively mimic the Fe&#8208;Nx active site's structure of natural peroxidase. To further meet the requirements of diverse biosensing applications, SACs POD&#8208;like activity still needs to be continuously enhanced. Herein, we introduce phosphorus heteroatoms to boost the POD&#8208;like activity of Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C SAC. A one&#8208;dimensional carbon nanowire (FeNCP/NW) catalyst with enriched Fe&#8208;N4 active sites is designed and synthesized, and phosphorus (P) atoms are doped in the carbon matrix to affect the Fe center through the long&#8208;range interaction. The experimental results show that the phosphorus&#8208;doping process can boost the POD&#8208;like activity more than the non&#8208;P&#8208;doped one with excellent selectivity and stability. The mechanism analysis results show that the introduction of P into SAC can first significantly enhance POD&#8208;like activity, and then decrease with increasing amount of P. As a proof of concept, the FeNCP/NW is employed in an enzyme cascade platform for highly&#8208;sensitive colorimetric detection of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.

         <title>Vesicular Antibodies: Shedding Light on Antibody Therapeutics with Cell Membrane Nanotechnology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent breakthroughs in membrane&#8208;derived vesicle nanotechnology have enabled vesicular&#8208;antibody&#8208;based therapy. By proposing the concept of vesicular antibodies, reviewing their engineering strategies and biomedical applications, and highlighting their unique advantages, this perspective intends to provide new insights on the development of vesicular antibodies.








Abstract
The high stability of antibodies and their ability to precisely bind to antigens and endogenous immune receptors, as well as their susceptibility to protein engineering, enable antibody&#8208;based therapeutics to be widely applied in cancer, inflammation, infection, and other disorders. Nevertheless, the application of traditional antibody&#8208;based therapeutics has certain limitations, such as high price, limited permeability, and protein engineering complexity. Recent breakthroughs in cell membrane nanotechnology have deepened the understanding of the critical role of membrane protein receptors in disease treatment, enabling vesicular&#8208;antibody&#8208;based therapeutics. Here, the concept of vesicular antibodies that are obtained by modifying target antibodies onto cell membranes for biomedical applications is proposed. Given that an antibody is basically a protein, as an extension of this concept, vesicles or membrane&#8208;coated nanoparticles that use surface antibodies and protein receptors on cell membranes for biomedical applications as vesicular antibodies are defined. Furthermore, several engineering strategies for vesicular antibodies are summarized and how vesicular antibodies can be used in a variety of situations is highlighted. In addition, current challenges and future prospects of vesicular antibodies are also discussed. It is anticipated this perspective will provide new insights on the development of next&#8208;generation antibodies for enhanced therapeutics.

         <title>Energy Efficient Neuro&#8208;inspired Phase Change Memory Based on Ge4Sb6Te7 as a Novel Epitaxial Nanocomposite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Phase change memory (PCM) is a promising candidate for neuro&#8208;inspired, data&#8208;intensive artificial intelligence applications, which relies on the physical attributes of PCM materials including gradual change of resistance states and multilevel operation with low resistance drift. However, achieving these attributes simultaneously remains a fundamental challenge for PCM materials such as Ge2Sb2Te5, the most commonly used material. Here we demonstrate bi&#8208;directional gradual resistance changes with &#8764;10x resistance window using low energy pulses in nanoscale PCM devices based on Ge4Sb6Te7, a new phase change nanocomposite material. These devices show 13 resistance levels with low resistance drift for the first 8 levels, resistance on/off ratio of &#8764;1000, and low variability. These attributes are enabled by the unique microstructural and electrothermal properties of Ge4Sb6Te7, a nanocomposite consisting of epitaxial SbTe nanoclusters within the Ge&#8208;Sb&#8208;Te matrix, and a higher crystallization but lower melting temperature than Ge2Sb2Te5. These results advance the pathway towards energy&#8208;efficient analog computing using PCM.

         <title>Scalable Fabrication of Dual&#8208;Function Fabric for Zero&#8208;Energy Thermal Environmental Management Through Multiband, Synergistic, and Asymmetric Optical Modulations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Solar heating and radiative cooling techniques have been proposed for passive space thermal management to reduce the global energy burden. However, the currently used single&#8208;function envelope/coating materials can only achieve static temperature regulation, presenting limited energy savings and poor adaption to dynamic environments. In this study, we developed a sandwich&#8208;structured fabric, composed of vertical graphene, graphene glass fiber fabric, and polyacrylonitrile nanofibers, with heating and cooling functions integrated through multiband, synergistic, (solar spectrum and mid&#8208;infrared ranges), and asymmetric optical modulations on two sides of the fabric. The dual&#8208;function fabric demonstrated high adaption to the dynamic environment and superior performance in a zero&#8208;energy&#8208;input temperature regulation. Furthermore, it demonstrated &#8764;15.5 and &#8764;31.1&#160;MJ m&#8722;2 y&#8722;1 higher annual energy savings compared to those of their cooling&#8208;only and heating&#8208;only counterparts, corresponding to &#8764;173.7 MT reduction in the global CO2 emission. The fabric exhibited high scalability for batch manufacturing with commercially abundant raw materials and facile technologies, providing a favorable guarantee of its mass production and use.

A branched polymeric drug delivery system can be used as a previously unknown metabolic modulator to improve the tumor immune microenvironment via interfering with the metabolic processes of tumor cells to increase the concentration of essential nutrients and reduce the level of immunosuppressive metabolites in the tumor microenvironment, thus creating a favorable environment for infiltrated immune cells.

Tumor cells are dominant in the nutritional competition in the tumor microenvironment, and their metabolic abnormalities often lead to microenvironmental acidosis and nutrient deprivation, thereby impairing the function of immune cells and diminishing the antitumor therapeutic effect. Herein, a branched polymeric conjugate and its efficacy in attenuating the metabolic competition of tumor cells are reported. Compared with the control nanoparticles prepared from its linear counterpart, the branched&#8208;conjugate&#8208;based nanoparticles can more efficiently accumulate in the tumor tissue and interfere with the metabolic processes of tumor cells to increase the concentration of essential nutrients and reduce the level of immunosuppressive metabolites in the TME, thus creating a favorable environment for infiltrated immune cells. Its combined treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) achieves an enhanced antitumor effect. The work presents a promising approach for targeting metabolic competition in the TME to enhance the chemo&#8208;immunotherapeutic effect against cancers.

         <title>Conformal Volumetric Grayscale Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conformal volumetric grayscale metamaterials are presented as a new class of artificially structured media capable of multiplexing electromagnetic responses as a function of frequency and incident beam form. These materials can realize new classes of multifunctional devices including conformal microwave carpet cloaks, which render an object invisible to observers for a wide range of probing frequencies and incidence angles.








Abstract
Conformal artificial electromagnetic media that feature tailorable responses as a function of incidence wavelength and angle represent universal components for optical engineering. Conformal grayscale metamaterials are introduced as a new class of volumetric electromagnetic media capable of supporting highly multiplexed responses and arbitrary, curvilinear form factors. Subwavelength&#8208;scale voxels based on irregular shapes are designed to accommodate a continuum of dielectric values, enabling the freeform design process to reliably converge to exceptionally high figures of merit (FOMs) for a given multi&#8208;objective design problem. Through additive manufacturing of ceramic&#8211;polymer composites, microwave metamaterials, designed for the radio&#8208;frequency range of 8&#8211;12&#160;GHz, are experimentally fabricated and devices with extreme dispersion profiles, an airfoil&#8208;shaped beam&#8208;steering device, and a broadband, broad&#8208;angle conformal carpet cloak, are demonstrated. It is anticipated that conformal volumetric metamaterials will lead to new classes of compact and multifunctional imaging, sensing, and communications systems.

         <title>Regulating Surface Oxygen Activity by Perovskite&#8208;Coating&#8208;Stabilized Ultrahigh&#8208;Nickel Layered Oxide Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly active anionic redox in the ultrahigh&#8208;Ni layered oxide cathode is directly regulated by leveraging the stable oxygen vacancies/interstitials in a lithium and oxygen dual&#8208;ion conductor perovskite coating layer, which facilitates surface lithium&#8208;ion diffusion kinetics and electronic conductivity at the same time. This work provides an effective strategy for capacity versus stability juggling of the high&#8208;energy cathodes.








Abstract
Ultrahigh&#8208;Ni layered oxides are proposed as promising cathodes to fulfill the range demand of electric vehicles; yet, they are still haunted by compromised cyclability and thermal robustness. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art surface coating has been applied to solve the instability via blocking the physical contact between the electrolyte and the highly active Ni4+ ions on the cathode surface, but it falls short in handling the chemo&#8211;physical mobility of the oxidized lattice oxygen ions in the cathode. Herein, a direct regulation strategy is proposed to accommodate the highly active anionic redox within the solid phase. By leveraging the stable oxygen vacancies/interstitials in a lithium and oxygen dual&#8208;ion conductor (layered perovskite La4NiLiO8) coating layer, the reactivity of the surface lattice oxygen ion is dramatically restrained. As a result, the oxygen release from the lattice is suppressed, as well as the undesired irreversible phase transition and intergranular mechanical cracking. Meanwhile, the introduced dual&#8208;ion conductor can also facilitate lithium&#8208;ion diffusion kinetics and electronic conductivity on the particle surface. This work demonstrates that accommodating the anionic redox chemistry by dual&#8208;ion conductors is an effective strategy for capacity versus stability juggling of the high&#8208;energy cathodes.

         <title>A Novel &#8220;Inside&#8208;Out&#8221; Intraocular Nanomedicine Delivery Mode for Nanomaterials&#8217; Biological Effect Enhanced Choroidal Neovascularization Occlusion and Microenvironment Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pt and Au nanoparticle decorated zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 nanoplatform is developed to load indocyanine green for precise choroidal neovascularization occlusion and microenvironment regulation. A novel &#8220;inside&#8208;out&#8221; intraocular nanomedicine delivery mode is exploited to penetrate the internal limiting membrane through M&#252;ller cells endocytosis. The mRNA expressions of hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor&#8208;1&#945; and VEGF reduce by 90.2% and 81.7%, respectively, compared to verteporfin treatment.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is commonly used in choroidal neovascularization (CNV) treatment due to the superior light transmittance of the eye. However, PDT often leads to surrounding tissue damage and further microenvironmental deterioration, including exacerbated hypoxia, inflammation, and secondary neovascularization. In this work, Pt nanoparticles (NPs) and Au NPs decorated zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 nanoplatform is developed to load indocyanine green for precise PDT and microenvironment amelioration, which can penetrate the internal limiting membrane through M&#252;ller cells endocytosis and target to CNV by surface&#8208;grafted cyclo(Arg&#8211;Gly&#8211;Asp&#8211;d&#8208;Phe&#8211;Lys) after intravitreal injection. The excessive H2O2 in the CNV microenvironment is catalyzed by catalase&#8208;like Pt NPs for hypoxia relief and enhanced PDT occlusion of neovascular. Meanwhile, Au NPs show significant anti&#8208;inflammatory and anti&#8208;angiogenesis properties in regulating macrophages and blocking vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Compared with verteporfin treatment, the mRNA expressions of hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor&#8208;1&#945; and VEGF in the nanoplatform group are downregulated by 90.2% and 81.7%, respectively. Therefore, the nanoplatform realizes a comprehensive CNV treatment effect based on the high drug loading capacity and biosafety. The CNV treatment mode developed in this work provides a valuable reference for treating other diseases with similar physiological barriers that limit drug delivery and similar microenvironment.

Abstract
Soft, deformable electronic devices provide the means to monitor physiological information and health conditions for disease diagnostics. However, their practical utility is limited due to the lack of intrinsical thermal switching for mechanically transformative adaptability and self&#8208;healing capability against mechanical damages. Here, we report the design concepts, materials and physics, manufacturing approaches, and application opportunities of self&#8208;healing, reconfigurable, thermal&#8208;switching device platforms based on hyperbranched polymers and biphasic liquid metal. The former provides excellent self&#8208;healing performance and unique tunable stiffness and adhesion regulated by temperature for the on&#8208;skin switch, whereas the latter results in liquid metal circuits with extreme stretchability (&gt; 900%) and high conductivity (3.40 &#215; 104 S cm&#8722;1), as well as simple recycling capability. Triggered by the increased temperature from the skin surface, a multifunctional device platform can conveniently conform and strongly adhere to the hierarchically textured skin surface for non&#8208;invasive, continuous, comfortable health monitoring. Additionally, the self&#8208;healing and adhesive characteristics allow multiple multifunctional circuit components to assemble and completely wrap on 3D curvilinear surfaces. Together, the design, manufacturing, and proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of the self&#8208;healing, transformative, and self&#8208;assembled electronics open up new opportunities for robust soft deformable devices, smart robotics, prosthetics, and Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things, and human&#8208;machine interfaces on irregular surfaces.

A strategy to create the high&#8208;entropy&#8208;stabilized (Ca0.2Sr0.2Ba0.2La0.2Pb0.2)TiO3&#160;perovskite that exhibits an enhanced effective microwave absorption band (90% absorption) is designed and developed. The favorable microstructural features, including abundant grain boundaries, oxygen defects, and strong shear strain caused by ultradense distorted lattices, can be achieved by regulating the entropy configuration.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy oxides (HEOs), which incorporate multiple&#8208;principal cations into single&#8208;phase crystals and interact with diverse metal ions, extend the border for available compositions and unprecedented properties. Herein, a high&#8208;entropy&#8208;stabilized (Ca0.2Sr0.2Ba0.2La0.2Pb0.2)TiO3&#160;perovskite is reported, and the effective absorption bandwidth (90% absorption) improves almost two times than that of BaTiO3. The results demonstrate that the regulation of entropy configuration can yield significant grain boundaries, oxygen defects, and an ultradense distorted lattice. These characteristics give rise to strong interfacial and defect&#8208;induced polarizations, thus synergistically contributing to the dielectric attenuation performance. Moreover, the large strains derived from the strong lattice distortions in the high&#8208;entropy perovskite offer varied transport for electron carriers. The high&#8208;entropy&#8208;enhanced positive/negative charges accumulation around grain boundaries and strain&#8208;concentrated location, quantitatively validated by electron holography, results in unusual dielectric polarization loss. This study opens up an effective avenue for designing strong microwave absorption materials to satisfy the increasingly demanding requirements of advanced and integrated electronics. This work also offers a paradigm for improving other interesting properties for HEOs through entropy engineering.

         <title>Thickness&#8208;Dependent Topological Hall Effect in Two&#8208;Dimensional Cr5Si3 Nanosheets with Non&#8208;Collinear Magnetic Phase</title>

Abstract
Antiferromagnets with non&#8208;collinear spin order are expected to exhibit unconventional electromagnetic response, such as spin Hall effects, chiral abnormal, quantum Hall effect and topological Hall effect. In this work, we synthesized two&#8208;dimensional (2D) thickness&#8208;controlled and high&#8208;quality Cr5Si3 nanosheets that is compatible with the CMOS technology by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. The angular dependence electromagnetic transport properties of Cr5Si3 nanosheets was investigated by physical property measurement system (PPMS) and an obvious topological Hall effect (THE) appeared at a large tilted magnetic field, which should result from the non&#8208;collinear magnetic structure of the Cr5Si3 nanosheet. The Cr5Si3 nanosheets exhibited distinct thickness&#8208;dependent perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) and the THE only emerged in the specific thickness rang with moderate PMA. Our work provides opportunities for exploring fundamental spin&#8208;related physical mechanisms of noncollinear antiferromagnet in ultrathin limit.

         <title>Sulfide Bridged Covalent Quinoxaline Frameworks for Lithium&#8208;Organo&#8208;Sulfide Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The chelating ability of quinoxaline cores and the redox activity of organo&#8208;sulfide bridges in layered covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (COFs) offer dual active sites for reversible lithium (Li)&#8208;storage. The designed COFs combining these properties feature disulfide and polysulfide&#8208;bridged networks showcasing an intriguing lithium&#8208;storage mechanism, which can be considered as a lithium&#8208;organo&#8208;sulfide (Li&#8208;OrS) battery. The experimental&#8208;computational elucidation of three quinoxaline COFs containing systematically enhanced sulfur atoms in sulfide bridging demonstrates fast kinetics during Li interactions with the quinoxaline core. Meanwhile, bilateral covalent bonding of sulfide bridges to quinoxaline core enables a redox&#8208;mediated reversible cleavage of the sulfur&#8208;sulfur bond and the formation of covalently anchored lithium&#8208;sulfide chains or clusters during Li&#8208;interactions, accompanied by a marked reduction of Li&#8208;polysulfide (Li&#8208;PS) dissolution into the electrolyte, a frequent drawback of lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries. The electrochemical behavior of model compounds mimicking the sulfide linkages of the COFs and operando Raman studies on the framework structure unravels the reversibility of the profound Li&#8208;ion&#8208;organo&#8208;sulfide interactions. As a result, nearly 84% retention of specific capacity was observed at 100&#160;mA/g for the polysulfide&#8208;bridged COF after 500 charge&#8208;discharge cycles. Thus, integrating redox&#8208;active organic&#8208;framework materials with covalently anchored sulfides enables a stable Li&#8208;OrS battery mechanism which shows benefits over a typical Li&#8208;S battery.

         <title>Strong&#8208;Proton&#8208;Adsorption Co&#8208;based Electrocatalysts Achieve Active and Stable Neutral Seawater Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Direct electrolysis of pH&#8208;neutral seawater to generate hydrogen is an attractive approach for storing renewable energy. However, due to the anodic competition between the chlorine evolution and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), direct seawater splitting suffers from a low current density and limited operating stability. Exploration of catalysts enabling an OER overpotential below the hypochlorite formation overpotential (&#8764; 490 mV) is critical to suppress the chloride evolution and facilitate the seawater splitting. Here we report a proton&#8208;adsorption&#8208;promoting strategy to increase the OER rate, resulting in a promoted and more stable neutral seawater splitting. The best catalysts herein are strong&#8208;proton&#8208;adsorption (SPA) materials such as palladium&#8208;doped cobalt oxide (Co3&#8208;xPdxO4) catalysts. These achieve an OER overpotential of 370 mV at 10 mA/cm2 in pH&#8208;neutral simulated seawater, outperforming Co3O4 by a margin of 70 mV. Co3&#8208;xPdxO4 catalysts provide stable catalytic performance for 450 hours at 200 mA/cm2 and 20 hours at 1 A/cm2 in neutral seawater. Experimental studies and theoretical calculations suggest that the incorporation of SPA cations accelerates the rate&#8208;determining water dissociation step in neutral OER pathway, and control studies rule out the provision of additional OER sites as a main factor herein.

         <title>Toward the Speed Limit of Phase Change Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Phase change memory (PCM) is one of the most promising candidates for next&#8208;generation data&#8208;storage technology, the programming speed of which has enhanced within a timescale from milliseconds to subnanosecond (&#8764;500 picoseconds) through decades of effort. As the potential applications of PCM strongly depend on the switching speed, namely, the time required for the recrystallization of amorphous chalcogenide media, the finding of the ultimate crystallization speed is of great importance both theoretically and practically. Here, through systematic analysis of discovered phase change materials and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, we first predict elemental Sb&#8208;based PCM may have a superfast crystallization speed. Indeed, such cells experimentally present extremely fast crystallization speeds within 360&#160;ps. Remarkably, the recrystallization process is further speeded up as the device shrinks, and a record fast crystallization speed of only 242&#160;ps is achieved in 60&#160;nm&#8208;size devices. These findings open opportunities for DRAM&#8208;like and even cache&#8208;like PCM using appropriate storage materials.

         <title>Boosting Ferroptosis Therapy with Iridium Single Atom Nanocatalyst in Ultra&#8208;low Metal Content</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Nanocatalysts pose great promise as tumor therapeutic agents due to their potent capacity to induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) in tumor microenvironment (TME). Although increasing metal loading can improve the catalytic activity, addressing the dilemma between high metal content and potential systemic biotoxicity it poses still remains a great challenge. Here, we report a fully exposed active site strategy by site&#8208;specific anchoring single iridium (Ir) atoms on the outer surface of nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon composite (Ir SAC) to obtain notable catalytic performance in an ultra&#8208;low metal content (&#8764; 0.11%). Ir SAC exhibited prominent dual enzymatic activities to mimic peroxidase (POD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSHOx), which can catalyze the conversion of endogenous H2O2 into &#8226;OH in the acidic TME and deplete glutathione (GSH) simultaneously. With advanced support of a GSH&#8208;trapping platinum(IV), this nanocatalytic agent (Pt@IrSAC) caused intense lipid peroxidation that boosted tumor cell ferroptosis. Pt@IrSAC was further encapsulated with the membrane of red blood cells (Pt@IrSAC/RBC) to improve biocompatibility and biodistribution of nanocatalysts in vivo. The Pt@IrSAC/RBC demonstrated superior therapeutic efficacy in a mouse triple&#8208;negative mammary carcinoma model, resulting in complete tumor ablation in a single treatment session and negligible side effects. To our best knowledge, this is the first report on an ultra&#8208;low metal content Ir single atom catalyst for tumor ferroptosis therapy, which may provide valuable insights into the design of nanocatalysts with high performance and biosafety for biomedical applications.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nanocatalysts pose great promise as tumor therapeutic agents due to their potent capacity to induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) in tumor microenvironment (TME). Although increasing metal loading can improve the catalytic activity, addressing the dilemma between high metal content and potential systemic biotoxicity it poses still remains a great challenge. Here, we report a fully exposed active site strategy by site-specific anchoring single iridium (Ir) atoms on the outer surface of nitrogen-doped carbon composite (Ir SAC) to obtain notable catalytic performance in an ultra-low metal content (&#8764; 0.11%). Ir SAC exhibited prominent dual enzymatic activities to mimic peroxidase (POD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSHOx), which can catalyze the conversion of endogenous H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into &#8226;OH in the acidic TME and deplete glutathione (GSH) simultaneously. With advanced support of a GSH-trapping platinum(IV), this nanocatalytic agent (Pt@IrSAC) caused intense lipid peroxidation that boosted tumor cell ferroptosis. Pt@IrSAC was further encapsulated with the membrane of red blood cells (Pt@IrSAC/RBC) to improve biocompatibility and biodistribution of nanocatalysts in vivo.

         <title>3D Printing a Low&#8208;Cost Miniature Accommodating Optical Microscope</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The key optical and optomechanical components of a miniature accommodating optical microscope are 3D printed in 50 min for less than $4. Synergizing the built&#8208;in voice&#8208;coil motor and compliant optomechanics facilitates focus&#8208;stacking functionality for extending imaging depth. 3D printing enables digitized component manufacturing, part&#8208;count reduction, and passive alignment for the ease of system assembly and alignment, allowing rapid customizability toward task&#8208;specific needs.








Abstract
This decade has witnessed the tremendous progress in miniaturizing optical imaging systems. Despite the advancements in 3D printing optical lenses at increasingly smaller dimensions, challenges remain in precisely manufacturing the dimensionally compatible optomechanical components and assembling them into a functional imaging system. To tackle this issue, the use of 3D printing to enable digitalized optomechanical component manufacturing, part&#8208;count&#8208;reduction design, and the inclusion of passive alignment features is reported here, all for the ease of system assembly. The key optomechanical components of a penny&#8208;sized accommodating optical microscope are 3D printed in 50 min at a significantly reduced unit cost near $4. By actuating a built&#8208;in voice&#8208;coil motor, its accommodating capability is validated to focus on specimens located at different distances, and a focus&#8208;stacking function is further utilized to greatly extend depth of field. The microscope can be readily customized and rapidly manufactured to respond to task&#8208;specific needs in form factor and optical characteristics.

         <title>MXene&#8208;Nanoflakes&#8208;Enabled All&#8208;Optical Nonlinear Activation Function for On&#8208;Chip Photonic Deep Neural Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new nanoflake 2D material MXene is designed for a neural network nonlinear broadband activator on a chip and realized using waveguide spectroscopy. The proposed configurations are reconfigurable and can therefore be adjusted for various applications without the need to modify the physical structure of the proposed MXene&#8208;based activator configurations via tuning the wavelength of operation.








Abstract
2D metal carbides and nitrides (MXene) are promising material platforms for on&#8208;chip neural networks owing to their nonlinear saturable absorption effect. The localized surface plasmon resonances in metallic MXene nanoflakes may play an important role in enhancing the electromagnetic absorption; however, their contribution is not determined due to the lack of a precise understanding of its localized surface plasmon behavior. Here, a saturable absorber made of MXene thin film and a silicon waveguide with MXene flakes overlayer are developed to perform neuromorphic tasks. The proposed configurations are reconfigurable and can therefore be adjusted for various applications without the need to modify the physical structure of the proposed MXene&#8208;based activator configurations via tuning the wavelength of operation. The capability and feasibility of the obtained results of machine&#8208;learning applications are confirmed via handwritten digit classification task, with near 99% accuracy. These findings can guide the design of advanced ultrathin saturable absorption materials on a chip for a broad range of applications.

         <title>Electron Lifetime of Over One Month in Disordered Organic Solid&#8208;State Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultralong charge&#8208;carrier lifetime of more than one month in a disordered film of an organic semiconductor stored at room temperature is demonstrated. The charge carriers stored in the film are stabilized by spontaneous orientation polarization. It is also revealed that the charge carriers retain spatial information due to their slow diffusion in the plane of the organic layer.








Abstract
Understanding intrinsic carrier lifetime in disordered organic solid&#8208;state semiconductors is essential for improving device performance in not only molecule&#8208;based optoelectronic devices such as organic solar cells (OSC) but also photocatalysts used for producing solar fuel cells. Carriers in disordered films are generally thought to have short lifetimes on a scale ranging from nanoseconds to milliseconds. These short carrier lifetimes cause loss of charges in OSCs and low quantum yields in photocatalysts and impede the future application of organic semiconductors to, for example, charge&#8208;storage&#8208;based memory devices. This study reports an ultralong intrinsic carrier lifetime of more than one month in a disordered film of an organic semiconductor stored at room temperature without external power. This extraordinary lifetime, which is several orders of magnitude longer than that generally believed possible in conventional organic semiconductors, arises from carrier stabilization by spontaneous orientation polarization, excited spin&#8208;triplet recycling, and blocking of recombination processes in disordered films.

         <dc:description>
The properties and application progress of hollow multi&#8208;shelled structure (HoMS) drug delivery system (DDS) for small&#8208;molecule and macromolecular drugs.








Abstract
Hollow&#8208;structured nanomaterials (HSNMs) have attracted increased interest in biomedical fields, owing to their excellent potential as drug delivery systems (DDSs) for clinical applications. Among HSNMs, hollow multi&#8208;shelled structures (HoMSs) exhibit properties such as high loading capacity, sequential drug release, and multi&#8208;functionalized modification and represent a new class of nanoplatforms for clinical applications. The remarkable properties of HoMS&#8208;based DDS can simultaneously satisfy and enhance DDSs for delivering small molecular drugs (e.g., antibiotics, chemotherapy drugs, and imaging agents) and macromolecular drugs (e.g., protein/peptide&#8208; and nucleic acid&#8208;based drugs). First, the latest research advances in delivering small molecular drugs are summarized and highlight the inherent advantages of HoMS&#8208;based DDSs for small molecular drug targeting, combining continuous therapeutic drug delivery and theranostics to optimize the clinical benefit. Meanwhile, the macromolecular drugs DDSs are in the initial development stage and currently offer limited delivery modes. There is a growing need to analyze the deficiency of other HSNMs and integrate the advantages of HSNMs, providing solutions for the safe, stable, and cascade delivery of macromolecular drugs to meet vast treatment requirements. Therefore, the latest advances in HoMS&#8208;based DDSs are comprehensively reviewed, mainly focusing on the characteristics, research progress by drug category, and future research prospects.

         <dc:description>
A hot&#8208;air&#8208;assisted ambient fabrication technique is introduced to prepare 2D layered perovskite films for efficient and stable solar cells. This method is material&#8208;saving, humidity&#8208;insensitive, large&#8208;area&#8208;applicable, and adaptable for different 2D perovskites. High&#8208;quality 2D perovskite films are obtained with good crystallinity, preferable orientation, and desirable morphology.








Abstract
2D layered perovskites (LPs) have shown great potential to deliver high&#8208;performance photovoltaic devices with long&#8208;term stability. Despite many signs of progress being made in film quality and device performance, LP films are mainly processed in strict conditions and through non&#8208;scalable techniques. Here, the hot&#8208;air&#8208;assisted ambient fabrication technique is introduced to prepare LP films for efficient and stable solar cells. The high&#8208;quality LP films with good crystallinity, preferable orientation and desirable morphology are obtained by balancing the crystal nucleation and growth processes. Employing the synchrotron&#8208;based in situ grazing&#8208;incidence X&#8208;ray diffraction technique, hot air induces the solidification of solutes and forms an intermediate at the air&#8211;liquid interface, which transforms into 3D&#8208;like perovskite, followed by the growth of the 2D species toward the substrate. The optimal LP film delivers a device power conversion efficiency of 16.36%, the best value for the LP&#8208;based solar cells prepared by the non&#8208;spin&#8208;coating techniques. The solar cell performance is insensitive to the film processing humidity and the device size is upscalable, which promises real&#8208;world deployment of LP&#8208;based optoelectronic devices.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2D layered perovskites (LPs) have shown great potential to deliver high-performance photovoltaic devices with long-term stability. Despite many signs of progress being made in film quality and device performance, LP films are mainly processed in strict conditions and through non-scalable techniques. Here, the hot-air-assisted ambient fabrication technique is introduced to prepare LP films for efficient and stable solar cells. The high-quality LP films with good crystallinity, preferable orientation and desirable morphology are obtained by balancing the crystal nucleation and growth processes. Employing the synchrotron-based in situ grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction technique, hot air induces the solidification of solutes and forms an intermediate at the air&#8211;liquid interface, which transforms into 3D-like perovskite, followed by the growth of the 2D species toward the substrate. The optimal LP film delivers a device power conversion efficiency of 16.36%, the best value for the LP-based solar cells prepared by the non-spin-coating techniques. The solar cell performance is insensitive to the film processing humidity and the device size is upscalable, which promises real-world deployment of LP-based optoelectronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Integrated Solar Panel with a Triboelectric Nanogenerator Array for Synergistic Harvesting of Raindrop&#160;and Solar Energy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A constructed integrated generator with a raindrop triboelectric nanogenerator (R&#8208;TENG) array and a solar panel can realize all&#8208;weather, complementary energy harvesting of raindrop and solar energy, and sustainable energy supply for the widely distributed sensors, which can promote the self&#8208;powered wireless environmental monitoring and the development of remote meteorological monitoring or smart farming, etc.








Abstract
The triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is regarded as an effective strategy for harvesting energy from raindrops, and is a complementary solution with solar cells to achieve all&#8208;weather energy harvesting and sustainable energy supply. However, due to the irregularity of natural rainfalls in the volume, frequency, density, and location, designing high&#8208;efficiency raindrop TENG (R&#8208;TENG) arrays faces great challenges. In this work, a highly transparent, large&#8208;area, and high&#8208;efficiency R&#8208;TENG array with rational material choice, electrode structure, and array distribution is developed for efficiently harvesting irregular raindrop energy. The problem of electrical signal cancellation among adjacent raindrops can be fully avoided, as viewed from the high&#8208;resolution space&#8211;time analyses of high&#8208;speed camera and electrical signal characteristics. With the rationally designed electrode instead of multiple complex electrodes, all charges can be exported by the R&#8208;TENG array in a simulated irregular raindrop scenario. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the R&#8208;TENG possesses higher average power density (40.80&#160;mW m&#8722;2) than that of the solar cell (37.03&#160;mW m&#8722;2) in rainy condition. Additionally, a self&#8208;powered wireless light&#8208;intensity&#8208;monitoring system is demonstrated for real&#8208;time and all&#8208;day weather monitoring. This work provides useful guidance for designing high&#8208;efficiency TENG arrays integrated with solar panels for harvesting irregular raindrop energy and solar energy.

         <title>Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Mediated Drug Delivery for First Aid</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)&#8208;mediated first&#8208;aid system is developed for targeted drug delivery (uFAST), which enables autonomous administration of emergency therapeutics via UAVs to achieve timely first aid. The implementability and safety of the uFAST with a dual&#8208;mode glucagon microneedle patch in emergency care is well demonstrated in a severe hypoglycemic pig disease model.








Abstract
Timely administration of key medications toward patients with sudden diseases is critical to saving lives. However, slow transport of first&#8208;aid therapeutics and the potential absence of trained people for drug usage can&#160;lead&#160;to severe injuries or even death. Herein, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)&#8208;mediated first&#8208;aid system for targeted delivery (uFAST) is developed. It allows unattended administration of emergency therapeutics&#8208;loaded transdermal microneedle (MN) patches toward patients to relieve symptoms by a contact&#8208;triggered microneedle applicator (CTMA). The implementability and safety of the uFAST for first aid is demonstrated in a severe hypoglycemic pig model by automatically delivering a glucagon patch with immediate and bioresponsive dual release modes. This platform technique may facilitate the development of UAV&#8208;mediated first&#8208;aid treatments for other sudden diseases.

         <title>Oral Delivery of siRNA Using Fluorinated, Small&#8208;Sized Nanocapsules toward Anti&#8208;Inflammation Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small&#8208;sized, reversibly cross&#8208;linked, fluorinated nanocapsules are developed to mediate efficient intestinal absorption of siRNA and systemic tumor necrosis factor &#945; gene silencing via oral administration. They feature high oral bioavailability of 20.4%, and demonstrate potent anti&#8208;inflammatory efficacy against both acute and chronic inflammation. This study provides a transformative platform for oral siRNA delivery.








Abstract
Oral delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) provides a promising paradigm for treating diseases that require regular injections. However, the multiple gastrointestinal (GI) and systemic barriers often lead to inefficient oral absorption and low bioavailability of siRNA. Technologies that can overcome these barriers are still lacking, which hinders the clinical potential of orally delivered siRNA. Herein, small&#8208;sized, fluorinated nanocapsules (F&#8208;NCs) are developed to mediate efficient oral delivery of tumor necrosis factor &#945; (TNF&#8208;&#945;) siRNA for anti&#8208;inflammation treatment. The NCs possess a disulfide&#8208;cross&#8208;linked shell structure, thus featuring robust stability in the GI tract. Because of their small size (&#8776;30&#160;nm) and fluorocarbon&#8208;assisted repelling of mucin adsorption, the best&#8208;performing F3&#8208;NCs show excellent mucus penetration and intestinal transport capabilities without impairing the intestinal tight junction, conferring the oral bioavailability of 20.4% in relative to intravenous injection. The disulfide cross&#8208;linker can be cleaved inside target cells, causing NCs dissociation and siRNA release to potentiate the TNF&#8208;&#945; silencing efficiency. In murine models of acute and chronic inflammation, orally delivered F3&#8208;NCs provoke efficient TNF&#8208;&#945; silencing and pronounced anti&#8208;inflammatory efficacies. This study therefore provides a transformative strategy for oral siRNA delivery, and will render promising utilities for anti&#8208;inflammation treatment.

         <title>Chiral MoSe2 Nanoparticles for Ultrasensitive Monitoring of Reactive Oxygen Species In Vivo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral molybdenum diselenide nanoparticles modified by the fluorescent molecule (cyanine 3) are synthesized. They are used as nanoprobes for reactive oxygen species (ROS) detection through changes in chiral and fluorescent signals due to Mo4+ and Se2&#8722; oxidation reaction induced by ROS on the surface of nanoparticles. These signals can indicate the ROS levels in living cells and in vivo.








Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, and acute hepatitis, and quantification of ROS is critical for the early diagnosis of these diseases. In this work, a novel probe is developed,&#160;based on chiral molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2) nanoparticles (NPs) modified by the fluorescent molecule, cyanine 3 (Cy3). Chiral MoSe2 NPs show intensive circular dichroism (CD) signals at 390 and 550&#160;nm, whereas the fluorescence of Cy3 at 560&#160;nm is quenched by MoSe2 NPs. In the presence of ROS, the probe reacts with the ROS and then oxidates rapidly, resulting in decreased CD signals and the recovery of the fluorescence. Using this strategy, the limit of detection values of CD and fluorescent signals in living cells are 0.0093&#160;nmol/106 cells and 0.024&#160;nmol/106 cells, respectively. The high selectivity and sensitivity to ROS in complex biological environments is attributed to the Mo4+ and Se2&#8722; oxidation reactions on the surface of the NPs. Furthermore, chiral MoSe2 NPs are able to monitor the levels of ROS in vivo by the fluorescence. Collectively, this strategy offers a new approach for ROS detection and has the potential to inspire others to explore chiral nanomaterials as biosensors to investigate biological events.

         <title>Microenvironmentally Responsive Chemotherapeutic Prodrugs and CHEK2 Inhibitors Self&#8208;Assembled Micelles: Protecting Fertility and Enhancing Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A co&#8208;delivery micelle (BML@PMP) that consists of a reduction&#8208;sensitive paclitaxel prodrug (PMP) for chemotherapy and a CHEK2 inhibitor (BML277) is developed for both fertility protection and chemotherapy enhancement. The BML@PMP micelles enhance the antitumor effect by delivering a high dose of paclitaxel to the tumor and inhibiting DNA damage repair, and prevent fertility damage by inhibiting the CHEK2&#8208;TAp63&#945; pathway in the ovary.

Chemotherapy is a widely used and effective adjuvant treatment for cancer, and it has unavoidable damage to female fertility, with statistics showing 38% of women who have received chemotherapy are infertile. How to reduce fertility toxicity while enhancing the oncologic chemotherapy is a clinical challenge. Herein, co&#8208;delivery micelles (BML@PMP) are developed, which are composed of a reduction&#8208;sensitive paclitaxel prodrug (PMP) for chemotherapy and a CHEK2 inhibitor (BML277) for both fertility protection and chemotherapy enhancement. BML@PMP achieves fertility protection through three actions: (1) Due to the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, BML@PMP is more enriched in the tumor, while very little in the ovary (about 1/10th of the tumor). (2) Glutathione (GSH) triggers the release of PTX, and with low levels of GSH in the ovary, the amount of PTX released in the ovary is correspondingly reduced. (3) BML277 inhibits oocyte apoptosis by inhibiting the CHEK2&#8208;TAp63&#945; pathway. Because of the different downstream targets of CHEK2 in tumor cells and oocytes, BML277 also enhances chemotherapeutic efficacy by reducing DNA damage repair which is activated through the CHEK2 pathway. This bidirectional effect of CHEK2 inhibitor&#8208;based co&#8208;delivery system represents a promising strategy for improving oncology treatment indices and preventing chemotherapy&#8208;associated fertility damage.

         <title>Multiplexed Ultrasensitive Sample&#8208;to&#8208;Answer RT&#8208;LAMP Chip for the Identification of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and Influenza Viruses</title>

         <dc:description>
An ultrasensitive sample&#8208;to&#8208;answer chip operated by LED is developed to detect SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and influenza viruses simultaneously. The ultrafast target enrichment (&#8776;500&#215;) followed by autonomous elution and amplification via photothermal activation enables limit&#8208;of&#8208;detection of 0.5 copies &#181;L&#8722;1. The sensitive detection in point&#8208;of&#8208;care settings comparable to standard polymerase chain reaction allows timely management of various pandemic situations that may be faced shortly.








Abstract
Prompt on&#8208;site diagnosis of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 with other respiratory infections will have minimized the global impact of the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic through rapid, effective management. However, no such multiplex point&#8208;of&#8208;care (POC) chip has satisfied a suitable sensitivity of gold&#8208;standard nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs). Here, a rapid multiplexed ultrasensitive sample&#8208;to&#8208;answer loop&#8208;mediated isothermal amplification (MUSAL) chip operated by simple LED&#8208;driven photothermal amplification to detect six targets from single&#8208;swab sampling is presented. First, the MUSAL chip allows ultrafast on&#8208;chip sample preparation with &#8776;500&#8208;fold preconcentration at a rate of 1.2&#160;mL min&#8722;1. Second, the chip enables contamination&#8208;free amplification using autonomous target elution into on&#8208;chip reagents by photothermal activation. Finally, the chip accomplishes multiplexed on&#8208;chip diagnostics of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and influenza viruses with a limit of detection (LoD) of 0.5 copies &#181;L&#8722;1. The rapid, ultrasensitive, cost&#8208;effective sample&#8208;to&#8208;answer chip with a multiplex capability will allow timely management of various pandemics situations that may be faced shortly.

         <title>Correlated Rattling of Sodium&#8208;Chains Suppressing Thermal Conduction in Thermoelectric Stannides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tin&#8208;based intermetallics with tunnel frameworks encapsulating zigzag Na&#8208;chains show lower thermal conductivity with decreasing inter&#8208;Na distances. Na atoms behave as Einstein&#8208;like oscillators along the tunnel, while significant interactions exist both between Na atoms in the chain and between the chain and the framework. The large anisotropic oscillations, the correlation of Na atoms in the tunnels, and their interaction with frameworks&#160;lead to low thermal conductivity.








Abstract
Tin&#8208;based intermetallics with tunnel frameworks containing zigzag Na chains that excite correlated rattling impinging on the framework phonons are attractive as thermoelectric materials owing to their low lattice thermal conductivity. The correlated rattling of Na atoms in the zigzag chains and the origin of the low thermal conductivity is uncovered via experimental and computational analyses. The Na atoms behave as oscillators along the tunnel, resulting in substantial interactions between Na atoms in the chain and between the chain and framework. In these intermetallic compounds, a shorter inter&#8208;rattler distance results in lower thermal conductivity, suggesting that phonon scattering by the correlated rattling Na&#8208;chains is enhanced. These results provide new insights into the behavior of thermoelectric materials with low thermal conductivity and suggest strategies for the development of such materials that utilize the correlated rattling.

         <title>Direct CO2 Capture by Alkali&#8208;Dissolved Cellulose and Sequestration in Building Materials and Artificial Reef Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkali cellulose solutions are used as CO2 absorption media to lead mineralized cellulose materials at a tailorable cellulose&#8208;to&#8208;mineral ratio. Cellulose lean gels are converted into dry powders, shown as a functional component of ceramic glazes and cementitious composites; meanwhile, cellulose&#8208;rich gels are moldable and extrudable, yielding stone&#8208;like structures tested as artificial substrates for coral reef restoration.








Abstract
Current carbon capture and utilization (CCU) technologies require high energy input and costly catalysts. Here, an effective pathway is offered that addresses climate action by atmospheric CO2 sequestration. Industrially relevant highly reactive alkali cellulose solutions are used as CO2 absorption media. The latter lead to mineralized cellulose materials (MCM) at a tailorable cellulose&#8208;to&#8208;mineral ratio, forming organic&#8208;inorganic viscous systems (viscosity from 102 to 107&#160;mPa&#160;s and storage modulus from 10 to 105&#160;Pa). CO2 absorption and conversion into calcium carbonate and associated minerals translate to maximum absorption of 6.5&#160;gCO2 gcellulose&#8722;1, tracking inversely with cellulose loading. Cellulose lean gels are easily converted into dry powders, shown as a functional component of ceramic glazes and cementitious composites. Meanwhile, cellulose&#8208;rich gels are moldable and extrudable, yielding stone&#8208;like structures tested as artificial substrates for coral reef restoration. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) suggests new CCU opportunities for building materials, as demonstrated in underwater deployment for coral reef ecosystem restoration.

         <title>Hierarchical Porous Monoliths of Steel with Self&#8208;Reinforcing Adaptive Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous steel structures combining ultralow weight and high mechanical efficiency are manufactured by printing, reducing, and sintering wet foams containing iron oxide precursor particles. By forming new load&#8208;bearing struts when compressed, the porous structures are able to reversibly stiffen in response to nonuniform stresses, a behavior that conceptually resembles the unique adaptive properties of human bone.








Abstract
Porous structures offer an attractive approach to reduce the amount of natural resources used while maintaining relatively high mechanical efficiency. However, for some applications the drop in mechanical properties resulting from the introduction of porosity is too high, which has limited the broader utilization of porous materials in industry. Here, it is shown that steel monoliths can be designed to display high mechanical efficiency and reversible self&#8208;reinforcing properties when made with porous architectures with up to three hierarchical levels. Ultralight steel structures that can float on water and autonomously adapt their stiffness are manufactured by the thermal reduction and sintering of 3D printed foam templates. Using distinct mechanical testing techniques, image analysis, and finite element simulations, the mechanisms leading to the high mechanical efficiency and self&#8208;stiffening ability of the hierarchical porous monoliths are studied. The design and fabrication of mechanically stable porous monoliths using iron as a widely available natural resource is expected to contribute to the future development of functional materials with a more sustainable footprint.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Locked Tandem Fluorescent Probe for Imaging of Pyroptosis in Cancer Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;locked and tandem activatable probe (DTAP) is presented for real&#8208;time near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging of intratumoral pyroptosis during cancer chemo&#8208;immunotherapy in living mice. It provides a non&#8208;invasive tool to study the regulatory mechanism of pyroptosis during cancer therapy and predict cancer therapeutic efficacy, hence capable of being applied to optimize cancer chemo&#8208;immunotherapies for precision medicine.








Abstract
Real&#8208;time imaging of programmed cancer cell death (PCD) is imperative to monitor cancer therapeutic efficacy and tailor therapeutic regimens; however, specific in vivo detection of intratumoral pyroptosis remains challenging. Herein, a dual&#8208;locked and tandem activatable probe (DTAP) is reported for near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging of intratumoral pyroptosis during cancer chemo&#8208;immunotherapy in living mice. The probe comprises a hemicyanine dye dual&#8208;locked with an enzyme&#8208;responsive moiety that can be tandemly cleaved by pyroptosis&#8208;related biomarker (Caspase&#8208;1) and cancer biomarker (GGT) to turn on its NIRF signal. As pyroptosis plays a vital role in triggering anti&#8208;tumor immune responses, the activated signal of DTAP correlates well with the population of tumor&#8208;infiltrating cytotoxic T lymphocytes and tumor growth inhibition, consequently permitting the prediction of cancer therapeutic efficacy. This study also provides a non&#8208;invasive technique to study the regulatory mechanism of pyroptosis in cancer therapy and to optimize cancer chemo&#8208;immunotherapies for precision medicine.

         <title>Understanding Self&#8208;Assembly of Silica&#8208;Precipitating Peptides to Control Silica Particle Morphology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomimetic silaffin&#8208;based peptides give rise to different template structures depending on stereochemistry and connectivity of the central residue. NMR experiments help to decipher the peptidic template structures. The resulting structure&#8211;activity relationship provides a key to rationally control the assembly of such peptides and thereby the resulting silica material as the peptidic precursor structures determine the materials final architecture.








Abstract
The most advanced materials are those found in nature. These evolutionary optimized substances provide highest efficiencies, e.g., in harvesting solar energy or providing extreme stability, and are intrinsically biocompatible. However, the mimicry of biological materials is limited to a few successful applications since there is still a lack of the tools to recreate natural materials. Herein, such means are provided based on a peptide library derived from the silaffin protein R5 that enables rational biomimetic materials design. It is now evident that biomaterials do not form via mechanisms observed in vitro. Instead, the material's function and morphology are predetermined by precursors that self&#8208;assemble in solution, often from a combination of protein and salts. These assemblies act as templates for biomaterials. The RRIL peptides used here are a small part of the silica&#8208;precipitation machinery in diatoms. By connecting RRIL motifs via varying central bi&#8208; or trifunctional residues, a library of stereoisomers is generated, which allows characterization of different template structures in the presence of phosphate ions by combining residue&#8208;resolved real&#8208;time NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Understanding these templates in atomistic detail, the morphology of silica particles is controlled via manipulation of the template precursors.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recently reported new methods to induce strain are summarized and discussed, and the latest developments on the modification of electrical, magnetic, and optical properties of 2D materials are updated by strain engineering (in particular properties such as the electrochemical, magnetic and superconducting characteristics, and their strain tuning have received little attention previously), and future perspectives are presented.








Abstract
Strain engineering is a promising way to tune the electrical, electrochemical, magnetic, and optical properties of 2D&#160;materials, with the potential to achieve high&#8208;performance 2D&#8208;material&#8208;based devices ultimately. This review discusses the experimental and theoretical results from recent advances in the strain engineering of 2D materials. Some novel methods to induce strain are summarized and then the tunable electrical and optical/optoelectronic properties of 2D materials via strain engineering are highlighted, including particularly the previously less&#8208;discussed strain tuning of superconducting, magnetic, and electrochemical properties. Also, future perspectives of strain engineering are given for its potential applications in functional devices. The state of the survey presents the ever&#8208;increasing advantages and popularity of strain engineering for tuning properties of 2D materials. Suggestions and insights for further research and applications in optical, electronic, and spintronic devices are provided.

         <title>Intracellular Glucose&#8208;Depriving Polymer Micelles for Antiglycolytic Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A glucose&#8208;responsive polymer is designed, considering the unique metabolism of cancer cells. The polymer exhibits micellar&#8208;structure stability during blood circulation and accumulates in tumor tissues. Specific binding between the polymer and intracellular glucose induces glucose deprivation in tumor cells. Glucose metabolism is particularly inhibited; the lack of energy in tumor cells is intensified, leading to tumor suppression.








Abstract
A new anticancer strategy to exploit abnormal metabolism of cancer cells rather than to merely control the drug release or rearrange the tumor microenvironment is reported. An antiglycolytic amphiphilic polymer, designed considering the unique metabolism of cancer cells (Warburg effect) and aimed at the regulation of glucose metabolism, is synthesized through chemical conjugation between glycol chitosan (GC) and phenylboronic acid (PBA). GC&#8208;PBA derivatives form stable micellar structures under physiological conditions and respond to changes in glucose concentration. Once the micelles accumulate at the tumor site, intracellular glucose capture occurs, and the resultant energy deprivation through the inhibition of aerobic glycolysis remarkably suppresses tumor growth without significant side effects in vivo. This strategy highlights the need to develop safe and effective cancer treatment without the use of conventional anticancer drugs.

         <title>3D Printing of Self&#8208;Assembling Nanofibrous Multidomain Peptide Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multidomain peptides (MDPs), a class of self&#8208;assembling peptides, are used to 3D print complex, 3D structures. Multiple MDPs are demonstrated as printable, and oppositely charged MDPs are printed together into layered, porous constructs. MDPs are found to support high cell viability regardless of charge, while charge is shown to influence cellular behavior and morphology.








Abstract
3D printing has become one of the primary fabrication strategies used in biomedical research. Recent efforts have focused on the 3D printing of hydrogels to create structures that better replicate the mechanical properties of biological tissues. These pose a unique challenge, as soft materials are difficult to pattern in three dimensions with high fidelity. Currently, a small number of biologically derived polymers that form hydrogels are frequently reused for 3D printing applications. Thus, there exists a need for novel hydrogels with desirable biological properties that can be used as 3D printable inks. In this work, the printability of multidomain peptides (MDPs), a class of self&#8208;assembling peptides that form a nanofibrous hydrogel at low concentrations, is established. MDPs with different charge functionalities are optimized as distinct inks and are used to create complex 3D structures, including multi&#8208;MDP prints. Additionally, printed MDP constructs are used to demonstrate charge&#8208;dependent differences in cellular behavior in vitro. This work presents the first time that self&#8208;assembling peptides have been used to print layered structures with overhangs and internal porosity. Overall, MDPs are a promising new class of 3D printable inks that are uniquely peptide&#8208;based and rely solely on supramolecular mechanisms for assembly.

         <title>Picoperovskites: The Smallest Conceivable Isolated Halide Perovskite Structures Formed within Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halide perovskites CsPbBr3 and lead&#8208;free CsSnI3 form &#8220;picoperovskites&#8221; in 1.2&#8211;1.6&#160;nm&#8208;diameter single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes with cross&#8208;sectional unit&#8208;cell or sub&#8208;unit&#8208;cell dimensions. The smallest of these are bilayer inorganic polymers retaining ABX3 stoichiometry while intermediate&#8208;scale Cs3PbBr3 preserves Pb2+ by forming ordered vacancies. The largest Cs4Sn4Ix form alternates Cs4 and Sn4Ix layers along the nanotube cavities.








Abstract
Halide perovskite structures are revolutionizing the design of optoelectronic materials, including solar cells, light&#8208;emitting diodes, and photovoltaics when formed at the quantum scale. Four isolated sub&#8208;nanometer, or picoscale, halide perovskite structures formed inside &#8776;1.2&#8211;1.6&#160;nm single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) by melt insertion from CsPbBr3 and lead&#8208;free CsSnI3 are reported. Three directly relate to the ABX3 perovskite archetype while a fourth is a perovskite&#8208;like lamellar structure with alternating Cs4 and polyhedral Sn4Ix layers. In &#8776;1.4&#160;nm&#8208;diameter SWCNTs, CsPbBr3 forms Cs3PbIIBr5 nanowires, one ABX3 unit cell in cross section with the Pb2+ oxidation state maintained by ordered Cs+ vacancies. Within &#8776;1.2&#160;nm&#8208;diameter SWCNTs, CsPbBr3 and CsSnI3 form inorganic&#8208;polymer&#8208;like bilayer structures, one&#8208;fourth of an ABX3 unit cell in cross section with systematically reproduced ABX3 stoichiometry.

&lt;p&gt;Halide perovskites CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and lead-free CsSnI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; form &#8220;picoperovskites&#8221; in 1.2&#8211;1.6&#160;nm-diameter single-walled carbon nanotubes with cross-sectional unit-cell or sub-unit-cell dimensions. The smallest of these are bilayer inorganic polymers retaining ABX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; stoichiometry while intermediate-scale Cs&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; preserves Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; by forming ordered vacancies. The largest Cs&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;i&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halide perovskite structures are revolutionizing the design of optoelectronic materials, including solar cells, light-emitting diodes, and photovoltaics when formed at the quantum scale. Four isolated sub-nanometer, or picoscale, halide perovskite structures formed inside &#8776;1.2&#8211;1.6&#160;nm single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) by melt insertion from CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and lead-free CsSnI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are reported. Three directly relate to the ABX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite archetype while a fourth is a perovskite-like lamellar structure with alternating Cs&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and polyhedral Sn&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; layers. In &#8776;1.4&#160;nm-diameter SWCNTs, CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; forms Cs&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Pb&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; nanowires, one ABX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; unit cell in cross section with the Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; oxidation state maintained by ordered Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; vacancies. Within &#8776;1.2&#160;nm-diameter SWCNTs, CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and CsSnI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; form inorganic-polymer-like bilayer structures, one-fourth of an ABX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; unit cell in cross section with systematically reproduced ABX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; stoichiometry.

         <title>Graph Analysis with Multifunctional Self&#8208;Rectifying Memristive Crossbar Array</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A graph analysis based on the desired sneak current is performed using a self&#8208;rectifying memristor and a &#8220;metal cell at diagonalcrossbar array (mCBA)&#8221; structure. mCBA effectively extracts hidden information from complex networks without preprocessing and loss of information. Three graph algorithms (pathfinding, link prediction, community detection) and brain network&#8208;based attention&#8208;deficit/hyperactivity disorder classification are performed effectively based on the mCBA.








Abstract
Many big data have interconnected and dynamic graph structures growing over time. Analyzing these graphical data requires the hidden relationship between the nodes in the graphs to be identified, which has conventionally been achieved by finding the effective similarity. However, graphs are generally non&#8208;Euclidean, which does not allow finding it. In this study, the non&#8208;Euclidean graphs are mapped to a specific crossbar array (CBA) composed of self&#8208;rectifying memristors and metal cells at the diagonal positions. The sneak current, an intrinsic physical property in the CBA, allows for the identification of the similarity function. The sneak&#8208;current&#8208;based similarity function indicates the distance between the nodes, which can be used to predict the probability that unconnected nodes will be connected in the future, connectivity between communities, and neural connections in a brain. When all bit lines of the CBA are connected to the ground, the sneak current is suppressed, and the CBA can be used to search for adjacent nodes. This work demonstrates the physical calculation methods applied to various graphical problems&#160;using the CBA composed of the self&#8208;rectifying memristor based on the HfO2 switching layer. Moreover, such applications suffer less from the memristors&#8217; inherent issues related to their stochastic nature.

         <title>Synergistic Surface Modification of Tin&#8211;Lead Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergistic surface modification of mixed Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite films by the combination of piperazine and C60 pyrrolidine tris&#8208;acid realizes narrow&#8208;bandgap solar cells with power conversion efficiencies up to 22.7% and substantially elongated stability.








Abstract
Interfaces in thin&#8208;film photovoltaics play a pivotal role in determining device efficiency and longevity. In this work, the top surface treatment of mixed tin&#8211;lead (&#8776;1.26&#160;eV) halide perovskite films for p&#8211;i&#8211;n solar cells is studied. Charge extraction is promoted by treating the perovskite surface with piperazine. This compound reacts with the organic cations at the perovskite surface, modifying the surface structure and tuning the interfacial energy level alignment. In addition, the combined treatment with C60 pyrrolidine tris&#8208;acid (CPTA) reduces hysteresis and leads to efficiencies up to 22.7%, with open&#8208;circuit voltage values reaching 0.90&#160;V, &#8776;92% of the radiative limit for the bandgap of this material. The modified cells also show superior stability, with unencapsulated cells retaining 96% of their initial efficiency after &gt;2000 h of storage in N2 and encapsulated cells retaining 90% efficiency after &gt;450 h of storage in air. Intriguingly, CPTA preferentially binds to Sn2+ sites at film surface over Pb2+ due to the energetically favored exposure of the former, according to first&#8208;principles calculations. This work provides new insights into the surface chemistry of perovskite films in terms of their structural, electronic, and defect characteristics and this knowledge is used to fabricate state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art solar cells.

         <title>Terahertz Nonlinear Hall Rectifiers Based on Spin&#8208;Polarized Topological Electronic States in&#160;1T&#8208;CoTe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A second&#8208;order nonlinear Hall effect response for high&#8208;efficiency terahertz rectification, is observed in the spin&#8208;polarized 1T&#8208;CoTe2, led by the zero&#8208;magnetic&#8208;field&#160;extrinsic contribution of topological electronic states. The Hall&#8208;rectifier, without invoking any semiconductor junctions or bias voltage, shows up room&#8208;temperature responsivity of over 0.1 A W&#8722;1, and a mean noise equivalent power of 1 pW Hz&#8722;1/2, opening up device implementation based on quantum&#8208;wavefunction engineering.








Abstract
The zero&#8208;magnetic&#8208;field nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE) refers to the second&#8208;order transverse current induced by an applied alternating electric field; it indicates the topological properties of inversion&#8208;symmetry&#8208;breaking crystals. Despite several studies on the NLHE induced by the Berry&#8208;curvature dipole in Weyl semimetals, the direct current conversion by rectification is limited to very low driving frequencies and cryogenic temperatures. The nonlinear photoresponse generated by the NLHE at room temperature can be useful for numerous applications in communication, sensing, and photodetection across a high bandwidth. In this study, observations of the second&#8208;order NLHE in type&#8208;II Dirac semimetal CoTe2 under time&#8208;reversal symmetry are reported. This is determined by the disorder&#8208;induced extrinsic contribution on the broken&#8208;inversion&#8208;symmetry surface and room&#8208;temperature terahertz rectification without the need for semiconductor junctions or bias voltage. It is shown that remarkable photoresponsivity over 0.1 A W&#8722;1, a response time of approximately 710&#160;ns, and a mean noise equivalent power of 1 pW Hz&#8722;1/2 can be achieved at room temperature. The results open a new pathway for low&#8208;energy photon harvesting via nonlinear rectification induced by the NLHE in strongly spin&#8211;orbit&#8208;coupled and inversion&#8208;symmetry&#8208;breaking systems, promising a considerable impact in the field of infrared/terahertz photonics.

         <title>In Situ Absorption Characterization Guided Slot&#8208;Die&#8208;Coated High&#8208;Performance Large&#8208;Area Flexible Organic Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ absorption measurement is used to investigate the aggregation behavior of acceptors during slot&#8208;die&#8208;coating. The 1 cm2 flexible device can reach a power conversion efficiency of 13.70%, with excellent shelf stability and upscaling ability. The connected modules (180 cm2) can effectively power a smartphone, showing great potential for future applications.








Abstract
Slot&#8208;die coating is recognized as the most compatible method for the roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll (R2R) processing of large&#8208;area flexible organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the photovoltaic performance of large&#8208;area flexible OSC lags significantly behind that of traditional spin&#8208;coating devices. In this work, two acceptors, Qx&#8208;1 and Qx&#8208;2, show quite different film&#8208;formation kinetics in the slot&#8208;die coating process. In situ absorption spectroscopy indicates that the excessive crystallinity of Qx&#8208;2 provides early phase separation and early aggregation, resulting in oversized crystal domains. Consequently, the PM6:Qx&#8208;1&#8208;based 1&#160;cm2 flexible device exhibits an excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.70%, which is the best performance among the slot&#8208;die&#8208;coated flexible devices; in contrast, the PM6:Qx&#8208;2 blend shows a pretty poor efficiency, which is lower than 1%. Moreover, the 30 cm2 modules based on PM6:Qx&#8208;1, containing six 5 cm2 sub&#8208;cells, exhibit a PCE of 12.20%. After being stored in a glove box for over 6000&#160;h, the PCE remains at 103% of its initial values, indicating excellent shelf stability.

&lt;p&gt;In situ absorption measurement is used to investigate the aggregation behavior of acceptors during slot-die-coating. The 1 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; flexible device can reach a power conversion efficiency of 13.70%, with excellent shelf stability and upscaling ability. The connected modules (180 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) can effectively power a smartphone, showing great potential for future applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slot-die coating is recognized as the most compatible method for the roll-to-roll (R2R) processing of large-area flexible organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the photovoltaic performance of large-area flexible OSC lags significantly behind that of traditional spin-coating devices. In this work, two acceptors, Qx-1 and Qx-2, show quite different film-formation kinetics in the slot-die coating process. In situ absorption spectroscopy indicates that the excessive crystallinity of Qx-2 provides early phase separation and early aggregation, resulting in oversized crystal domains. Consequently, the PM6:Qx-1-based 1&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; flexible device exhibits an excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.70%, which is the best performance among the slot-die-coated flexible devices; in contrast, the PM6:Qx-2 blend shows a pretty poor efficiency, which is lower than 1%. Moreover, the 30 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; modules based on PM6:Qx-1, containing six 5 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; sub-cells, exhibit a PCE of 12.20%. After being stored in a glove box for over 6000&#160;h, the PCE remains at 103% of its initial values, indicating excellent shelf stability. Therefore, these results show a promising future strategy for the upscaling fabrication of flexible large-area OSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modular Approach to Creating Functionalized Surface Arrays of Molecular Qubits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method to create 2D arrays of molecular spin qubits is reported. The quantum properties are retained and the quantum coherence times are improved compared to bulk conditions.








Abstract
The quest for developing quantum technologies is driven by the promise of exponentially faster computations, ultrahigh performance sensing, and achieving thorough understanding of many&#8208;particle quantum systems. Molecular spins are excellent qubit candidates because they feature long coherence times, are widely tunable through chemical synthesis, and can be interfaced with other quantum platforms such as superconducting qubits. A present challenge for molecular spin qubits is their integration in quantum devices, which requires arranging them in thin films or monolayers on surfaces. However, clear proof of the survival of quantum properties of molecular qubits on surfaces has not been reported so far. Furthermore, little is known about the change in spin dynamics of molecular qubits going from the bulk to monolayers. Here, a versatile bottom&#8208;up method is reported to arrange molecular qubits as functional groups of self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) on surfaces, combining molecular self&#8208;organization and click chemistry. Coherence times of up to 13 &#181;s demonstrate that qubit properties are maintained or even enhanced in the monolayer.

         <title>Rational Design of Platinum&#8211;Bismuth Sulfide Schottky Heterostructure for Sonocatalysis&#8208;Mediated Hydrogen Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of sonocatalytic hydrogen evolution is first proposed. The synthesized platinum&#8211;bismuth sulfide&#160;nanoparticles exhibit ultrasound&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen production, glutathione oxidation, relieve hypoxia in vitro and in vivo, and effectively kill cancer cells by inhibiting cancer cell energy metabolism, increasing intratumoral reactive oxygen species levels, and inducing DNA damage.








Abstract
Conventional sonodynamic therapy is unavoidably limited by the tumor microenvironment, although many sonosensitizers have been developed to improve them to a certain extent. Given this, a concept of sonocatalytic hydrogen evolution is proposed, which is defined as an oxygen&#8208;independent therapeutics. To demonstrate the feasibility of the concept, the narrow&#8208;bandgap semiconductor bismuth sulfide (Bi2S3) is selected as the sonocatalyst and platinum (Pt) nanoparticles are grown in situ to optimize their catalytic performance. In this nanocatalytic system, the Pt nanoparticles help to capture sonoexcited electrons, whereas intratumoral overexpressed glutathione (GSH), as a natural hole sacrificial agent, can consume sonoexcited holes, which greatly improves the charge&#8208;separation efficiency and promotes controllable and sustainable H2&#160;generation. Even under hypoxic conditions, the Pt&#8208;Bi2S3&#160;nanoparticles can also produce sufficient H2&#160;under ultrasound irradiation. Mechanistically, mitochondrial dysfunction caused by H2&#160;and intratumoral redox homeostasis destruction by GSH depletion synergistically damage DNA to induce tumor cells apoptosis. At the same time, the Pt nanoparticles and holes can also trigger the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into O2&#160;to relieve tumor hypoxia,&#160;thus&#160;being synergistic with GSH depletion to reverse tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment. The proposed sonocatalysis&#8208;mediated therapy will provide a new direction to realize facile and efficient cancer therapy.

         <title>A Super Tough, Rapidly Biodegradable, Ultrafast Hemostatic Bioglue</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new bioglue is composed of amidated&#8208;gelatin and Tetra&#8208;PEG&#8208;SS for rapid hemostasis in massive hemorrhage. The amino terminals in gelatin quickly react with active ester moieties in the PEG&#8208;SS, endowing the amino&#8208;gelatin&#8208;PEG glue firm and indiscriminate adhesion with various moist tissues (e.g., adhesively sealing cardiac hemorrhagic wounds). The bioglue provides a fascinating hemostatic approach for clinical hemostasis and emergency rescue.








Abstract
Death happening due to massive hemorrhage has been involved in military conflicts, traffic accidents, and surgical injuries of various human disasters. Achieving rapid and effective hemostasis to save lives is crucial in urgent massive bleeding situations. Herein, a covalent cross&#8208;linked AG&#8208;PEG glue based on extracellular matrix&#8208;like amino&#8208;gelatin (AG) and PEG derivatives is developed. The AG&#8208;PEG glue gelatinizes fast and exhibits firm and indiscriminate close adhesion with various moist tissues upon being dosed. The formed glue establishes an adhesive and robust barrier to seal the arterial, hepatic, and cardiac hemorrhagic wounds, enabling it to withstand up to 380&#160;mmHg blood pressure in comparison with normal systolic blood pressure of 60&#8211;180&#160;mmHg. Remarkably, massive bleeding from a pig cardiac penetrating hole with 6&#160;mm diameter is effectively stopped using the glue within 60&#160;s. Postoperative indexes of the treated pig gradually recover and the cardiac wounds regrow significantly at 14&#160;days. Possessing on&#8208;demand solubility, self&#8208;gelling, and rapid degradability, the AG&#8208;PEG glue may provide a fascinating stop&#8208;bleeding approach for clinical hemostasis and emergency rescue.

         <title>Imaging Guided Endogenic H2&#8208;Augmented Electrochemo&#8208;Sonodynamic Domino Co&#8208;therapy of Tumor in Vivo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient and cost&#8208;effective imaging&#8208;guided/&#8208;assessed H2&#8208;therapy of tumors based on a joint electrochemo&#8208;sonodynamic treatment (H2&#8208;EC/SD co&#8208;therapy) is developed. The endogenic H2&#8208;triggered &#8220;domino effect&#8221; in tumor tissue is clearly revealed. The developed H2&#8208;EC/SD co&#8208;therapy guided by US imaging in vivo will open up a feasible new way for green, economic, and effective treatment of cancer in the future.








Abstract
Precise and on&#8208;demand release of sufficient hydrogen (H2) to tumor sites remains a key challenge for emerging H2&#8208;oncotherapy, and little is known about the physiological effects of &#8220;abundant&#8221; H2 on complex tumor microenvironments (TME). Here, a highly efficient and cost&#8208;effective imaging&#8208;guided/&#8208;assessed H2&#8208;therapy of tumors based on a joint electrochemo&#8208;sonodynamic treatment (H2&#8208;EC/SD co&#8208;therapy) with strong &#8220;domino effect&#8221; triggered by endogenous H2 generation at tumor sites is reported to speedily eliminate tumor tissue (&#8804;80&#160;mm3) within 1&#160;day. Adequate H2 is controllably generated in tumor sites through mild electrochemistry in vivo due to acidic TME by using clinical acupuncture Fe needles as electrodes. Besides starvation damage due to gas blockage/destruction of vessels, nano&#8208;/micro&#8208;bubbles of H2 formed in situ can elevate the tumor's internal temperature and burst vessels to further destroy the tumor&#160;under ultrasound irradiation. Remarkably, vulnerable homeostasis of TME is disturbed as H2 also participates in the physiological activity of tumor cells, leading to tumor dysfunction. Last but not least, the body's inflammatory response to cancer is reduced after the treatment, which is beneficial for the body's immune system during post&#8208;treatment recovery. Based on all of these merits, the H2&#8208;EC/SD co&#8208;therapy provides a potentially safe and viable therapeutic strategy for future clinical applications.

Inspired by the heterogeneous structure of adipose tissue, the first example of damping self&#8208;healable ionic elastomer is reported, which features a dynamic phase&#8208;separated structure with energy&#8208;dissipating nanophases embedded in an elastic matrix. By virtue of phase separation and sticky liquid crystal assembly of fluorinated copolymers, this design reconciles elasticity and damping capacity, which are usually contradictive in previous ionic skins.








Abstract
Shock&#8208;induced low&#8208;frequency vibration damage is extremely harmful to bionic soft robots and machines that may incur the malfunction of fragile electronic elements. However, current skin&#8208;like self&#8208;healable ionic elastomers as the artificial sensing and protecting layer still lack the ability to dampen vibrations, due to their almost opposite design for molecular frictions to material's elasticity. Inspired by the two&#8208;phase structure of adipose tissue (the natural damping skin layer), here, a highly damping ionic elastomer with energy&#8208;dissipating nanophases embedded in an elastic matrix is introduced, which is formed by polymerization&#8208;induced dynamic phase separation of sticky fluorinated copolymers in the presence of lithium salts. Such a supramolecular design decouples the elastic and damping functions into two distinct phases, and thus reconciles a few intriguing properties including ionic conductivity, high stretchability, softness, strain&#8208;stiffening, elastic recovery, room&#8208;temperature self&#8208;healability, recyclability, and most importantly, record&#8208;high damping capacity at the human motion frequency range (loss factor tan &#948;&#160;&gt;&#160;1 at 0.1&#8211;50&#160;Hz). This study opens the door for the artificial syntheses of high&#8208;performance damping ionic skins with robust sensing and protective applications in soft electronics and robotics.
