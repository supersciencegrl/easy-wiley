         <title>Energy Harvesting and Storage with Soft and Stretchable Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes methods to harvest ambient energy (mechanical, thermal, chemical, and electromagnetic energy) using soft and stretchable materials. These materials and devices pave the way for untethered soft robots, self&#8208;powered sensors, wearable devices, stretchable electronics, and electronic skins. The review also discusses challenges and opportunities associated with ambient energy harvesting techniques.








Abstract
This review highlights various modes of converting ambient sources of energy into electricity using soft and stretchable materials. These mechanical properties are useful for emerging classes of stretchable electronics, e&#8208;skins, bio&#8208;integrated wearables, and soft robotics. The ability to harness energy from the environment allows these types of devices to be tetherless, thereby leading to a greater range of motion (in the case of robotics), better compliance (in the case of wearables and e&#8208;skins), and increased application space (in the case of electronics). A variety of energy sources are available including mechanical (vibrations, human motion, wind/fluid motion), electromagnetic (radio frequency (RF), solar), and thermodynamic (chemical or thermal energy). This review briefly summarizes harvesting mechanisms and focuses on the materials&#8217; strategies to render such devices into soft or stretchable embodiments.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Level Charge Separation Strategies in Semiconductor&#8208;Based Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semiconductor photocatalytic efficiency greatly relies on effective charge separation. The recent progress of atomic&#8208;level strategies for promoting the charge separation and migration in the bulk, on the surface, and both bulk and surface of the photocatalysts are highlighted and a guideline for the bottom&#8208;up design of high&#8208;performance photocatalysts suggested.








Abstract
Semiconductor&#8208;based photocatalysis as a productive technology furnishes a prospective solution to environmental and renewable energy issues, but its efficiency greatly relies&#160;on the effective bulk and surface separation of photoexcited charge carriers. Exploitation of atomic&#8208;level strategies allows in&#8208;depth understanding on the related mechanisms and enables bottom&#8208;up precise design of photocatalysts, significantly enhancing photocatalytic activity. Herein, the advances on atomic&#8208;level charge separation strategies toward developing robust photocatalysts are highlighted, elucidating the fundamentals of charge separation and transfer processes and advanced probing techniques. The atomic&#8208;level bulk charge separation strategies, embodied by regulation of charge movement pathway and migration dynamic, boil&#160;down&#160;to shortening the charge diffusion distance to the atomic&#8208;scale, establishing atomic&#8208;level charge transfer channels, and enhancing the charge separation driving force. Meanwhile, regulating the in&#8208;plane surface structure and spatial surface structure are summarized as atomic&#8208;level surface charge separation strategies. Moreover, collaborative strategies for simultaneous manipulation of bulk and surface photocharges are also introduced. Finally, the existing challenges and future prospects for fabrication of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photocatalysts are discussed on the basis of a thorough comprehension of atomic&#8208;level charge separation strategies.

         <title>Approaching Crystal Structure and High Electron Mobility in Conjugated Polymer Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conjugated polymer microwire crystals are obtained from solvated aggregates. The precise crystal packing and electronic structure in polymer microwires are evaluated for understanding the charge transport properties. Polymer crystal transistors of F4BDOPV&#8208;2T exhibit higher electron mobilities of up to 5.58&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 with a much lower hopping energy barrier compared with the conventional thin&#8208;film transistors.








Abstract
Conjugated polymers usually form crystallized and amorphous regions in the solid state simultaneously, making it difficult to accurately determine their precise microstructures. The lack of multiscale microstructures of conjugated polymers limits the fundamental understanding of the structure&#8211;property relationships in polymer&#8208;based optoelectronic devices. Here, crystals of two typical conjugated polymers based on four&#8208;fluorinated benzodifurandione&#8208;based oligo(p&#8208;phenylene vinylene) (F4BDOPV) and naphthalenediimide (NDI) motifs, respectively, are obtained by a controlled self&#8208;assembly process. The strong diffractivity of the polymer crystals brings an opportunity to determine the crystal structures by combining X&#8208;ray techniques and molecular simulations. The precise polymer packing structures are useful as initial models to evaluate the charge transport properties in the ordered and disordered phases. Compared to the spin&#8208;coated thin films, the highly oriented polymer chains in crystals endow higher mobilities with a lower hopping energy barrier. Microwire crystal transistors of F4BDOPV&#8208; and NDI&#8208;based polymers exhibit high electron mobilities of up to 5.58 and 2.56&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1, respectively, which are among the highest values in polymer crystals. This work presents a simple method to obtain polymer crystals and their precise microstructures, promoting a deep understanding of molecular packing and charge transport for conjugated polymers.

         <title>A Virus&#8208;Mimicking Nucleic Acid Nanogel Reprograms Microglia and Macrophages for Glioblastoma Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A virus&#8208;mimicking membrane&#8208;coated nucleic acid nanogel Vir&#8208;Gel is constructed using therapeutic miRNA as a crosslinker to direct the self&#8208;assembly of DNA&#8208;grafted polycaprolactone (DNA&#8208;g&#8208;PCL) brushes to form a nanogel. Vir&#8208;Gel can effectively reprogram microglia and macrophages from a tumor&#8208;promoting M2 phenotype to an anti&#8208;tumor M1 phenotype, thereby breaking the immunosuppression tumor microenvironment of glioblastoma and improving the therapeutic effect.








Abstract
Immunotherapy is recognized as one of the most promising approaches to treat cancers. However, its effect in glioblastoma (GBM) treatment is insufficient, which can in part be attributed to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Microglia and macrophages are the main immune infiltrating cells in the TME of GBM. Unfortunately, instead of initiating the anti&#8208;tumor response, GBM&#8208;infiltrating microglia and macrophages switch to a tumor&#8208;promoting phenotype (M2), and support tumor growth, angiogenesis, and immunosuppression by the release of cytokines. In this work, a virus&#8208;mimicking membrane&#8208;coated nucleic acid nanogel Vir&#8208;Gel embedded with therapeutic miRNA is developed, which can reprogram microglia and macrophages from a pro&#8208;invasive M2 phenotype to an anti&#8208;tumor M1 phenotype. By mimicking the virus infection process, Vir&#8208;Gel significantly enhances the targetability and cell uptake efficiency of the miR155&#8208;bearing nucleic acid nanogel. In vivo evaluations demonstrate that Vir&#8208;Gel apparently prolongs the circulation lifetime of miR155 and endows it with an active tumor&#8208;targeting capability and excellent tumor inhibition efficacy. Owing to its noninvasive feature and effective delivery capability, the virus&#8208;mimicking nucleic acid nanogel provides a general and convenient platform that can successfully treat a wide range of diseases.

         <title>Metallic Diluted Dimerization in VO2 Tweeds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metal&#8211;insulator transition of VO2 holds promise for numerous applications, yet the phase trajectory remains poorly understood. This work shows that strained films develop multicomponent tweeds prior to relaxation to the monoclinic ground state, triggered by the nucleation of partially dimerized V&#8208;chains. The suppression of the bonding/antibonding splitting in&#160;&#8220;isolated&#8221; V sites renders metallicity to this new monoclinic phase.








Abstract
The observation of electronic phase separation textures in vanadium dioxide, a prototypical electron&#8208;correlated oxide, has recently added new perspectives on the long standing debate about its metal&#8211;insulator transition and its applications. Yet, the lack of atomically resolved information on phases accompanying such complex patterns still hinders a comprehensive understanding of the transition and its implementation in practical devices. In this work, atomic resolution imaging and spectroscopy unveils the existence of ferroelastic tweed structures on &#8776;5 nm length scales, well below the resolution limit of currently used spectroscopic imaging techniques. Moreover, density functional theory calculations show that this pretransitional fine&#8208;scale tweed, which on average looks and behaves like the standard metallic rutile phase, is in fact weaved by semi&#8208;dimerized chains of vanadium in a new monoclinic phase that represents a structural bridge to the monoclinic insulating ground state. These observations provide a multiscale perspective for the interpretation of existing data, whereby phase coexistence and structural intermixing can occur all the way down to the atomic scale.

This work shows that strained films develop multicomponent tweeds prior to relaxation to the monoclinic ground state, triggered by the nucleation of partially dimerized V&#8208;chains. The suppression of the bonding/antibonding splitting in&#160;&#8220;isolated&#8221; V sites renders metallicity to this new monoclinic phase.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The observation of electronic phase separation textures in vanadium dioxide, a prototypical electron&#8208;correlated oxide, has recently added new perspectives on the long standing debate about its metal&#8211;insulator transition and its applications. Yet, the lack of atomically resolved information on phases accompanying such complex patterns still hinders a comprehensive understanding of the transition and its implementation in practical devices. In this work, atomic resolution imaging and spectroscopy unveils the existence of ferroelastic tweed structures on &lt;b&gt;&#8776;&lt;/b&gt;5 nm length scales, well below the resolution limit of currently used spectroscopic imaging techniques. Moreover, density functional theory calculations show that this pretransitional fine&#8208;scale tweed, which on average looks and behaves like the standard metallic rutile phase, is in fact weaved by semi&#8208;dimerized chains of vanadium in a new monoclinic phase that represents a structural bridge to the monoclinic insulating ground state. These observations provide a multiscale perspective for the interpretation of existing data, whereby phase coexistence and structural intermixing can occur all the way down to the atomic scale.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Interplay of Different Major Ampullate Spidroins during Assembly and Implications for Fiber Mechanics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Natural spider major ampullate silk exhibits mechanical properties unmatched by most other known natural or man&#8208;made fibrous materials. Upon recombinant co&#8208;production of two different spidroins derived from one spider species, they interconnect already in solution and during assembly. Their interplay yields fibers with overall properties different to that of one&#8208;protein fibers, but equaling that of the natural blueprint.








Abstract
Major ampullate (MA) spider silk has fascinating mechanical properties combining strength and elasticity. All known natural MA silks contain at least two or more different spidroins; however, it is unknown why and if there is any interplay in the spinning dope. Here, two different spidroins from Araneus diadematus are co&#8208;produced in Escherichia coli to study the possible dimerization and effects thereof on the mechanical properties of fibers. During the production of the two spidroins, a mixture of homo&#8208; and heterodimers is formed triggered by the carboxyl&#8208;terminal domains. Interestingly, homodimeric species of the individual spidroins self&#8208;assemble differently in comparison to heterodimers, and stoichiometric mixtures of homo&#8208; and heterodimers yield spidroin networks upon assembly with huge impact on fiber mechanics upon spinning. The obtained results provide the basis for man&#8208;made tuning of spinning dopes to yield high&#8208;performance fibers.

         <title>Alloyed Palladium&#8211;Silver Nanowires Enabling Ultrastable Carbon Dioxide Reduction to Formate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 4, January 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alloyed Pd&#8211;Ag nanowires exhibit significantly improved stability for electrochemical CO2 reduction to formate at potentials where it was previously believed that the product could not be stably formed on Pd. This is due to the markedly enhanced CO tolerance and selective stabilization of key reaction intermediates on alloy nanowires.








Abstract
Palladium can enable the electrochemical CO2 reduction to formate with nearly zero overpotential and good selectivity. However, it usually has very limited stability owing to CO poisoning from the side reaction intermediate. Herein, it is demonstrated that alloying palladium with silver is a viable strategy to significantly enhance the electrocatalytic stability. Palladium&#8211;silver alloy nanowires are prepared in aqueous solution with tunable chemical compositions, large aspect ratio, and roughened surfaces. Thanks to the unique synergy between palladium and silver, these nanowires exhibit outstanding electrocatalytic performances for selective formate production. Most remarkably, impressive long&#8208;term stability is measured even at &lt;&#8201;&#8208;0.4&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode where people previously believed that formate cannot be stably formed on palladium. Such stability results from the enhanced CO tolerance and selective stabilization of key reaction intermediates on alloy nanowires as supported by detailed electrochemical characterizations and theoretical computations.

         <title>Amphipathic Side Chain of a Conjugated Polymer Optimizes Dopant Location toward Efficient N&#8208;Type Organic Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 4, January 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective increase in the Seebeck coefficient and improvement of the power factor by a factor of &#8776;5 in an n&#8208;doped donor&#8211;acceptor copolymer are realized by the use of amphipathic side chains. This strategy can properly control the dopant sites away from the backbone, which minimizes the adverse influence of counterions. Therefore, an excellent power factor of 18 &#181;W m&#8211;1 K&#8211;2 is achieved.








Abstract
There is no molecular strategy for selectively increasing the Seebeck coefficient without reducing the electrical conductivity for organic thermoelectrics. Here, it is reported that the use of amphipathic side chains in an n&#8208;type donor&#8211;acceptor copolymer can selectively increase the Seebeck coefficient and thus increase the power factor by a factor of &#8776;5. The amphipathic side chain contains an alkyl chain segment as a spacer between the polymer backbone and an ethylene glycol type chain segment. The use of this alkyl spacer does not only reduce the energetic disorder in the conjugated polymer film but can also properly control the dopant sites away from the backbone, which minimizes the adverse influence of counterions. As confirmed by kinetic Monte Carlo simulations with the host&#8211;dopant distance as the only variable, a reduced Coulombic interaction resulting from a larger host&#8211;dopant distance contributes to a higher Seebeck coefficient for a given electrical conductivity. Finally, an optimized power factor of 18 &#181;W m&#8211;1 K&#8211;2 is achieved in the doped polymer film. This work provides a facile molecular strategy for selectively improving the Seebeck coefficient and opens up a new route for optimizing the dopant location toward realizing better n&#8208;type polymeric thermoelectrics.

         <title>Path&#8208;Dependent Thermal Metadevice beyond Janus Functionalities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 4, January 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D path&#8208;dependent thermal metadevice can be designed to achieve three heat transfer behaviors (cloaking, concentrating, and transparency) along different directions at the same time by breaking the symmetry using successive 3D transformations. This path&#8208;dependent strategy provides a new dimension for multifunctional metamaterial devices in the thermal field and for more general diffusion processes.








Abstract
Janus metamaterials, metasurfaces, and monolayers have received intensive attention in nanophotonics and 2D materials. Their core concept is to introduce asymmetry along the wave propagation direction, by stacking different materials or layers of meta&#8208;atoms, or breaking out&#8208;of&#8208;plane mirror asymmetry with external biases. Nevertheless, it has been hitherto elusive to realize a diffusive Janus metadevice, since scalar diffusion systems such as heat conduction normally operate in the absence of polarization control, spin manipulation, or electric&#8208;field stimuli, which all are widely used in achieving optical Janus devices. It is even more challenging, if not impossible, for a single diffusive metadevice to exhibit more than two thermal functions. Here a path&#8208;dependent thermal metadevice beyond Janus characteristics is proposed, which can exhibit three distinct thermal behaviors (cloaking, concentrating, and transparency) under different directions of heat flow. The rotation transformation mechanism of thermal conductivity provides a robust platform to assign a specific thermal behavior in any direction. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiment of anisotropic in&#8208;plane conduction successfully validates such a path&#8208;dependent trifunction thermal metamaterial device. It is anticipated that this path&#8208;dependent strategy can provide a new dimension for multifunctional metamaterial devices in the thermal field, as well as for a more general diffusion process.

         <title>3D&#8208;Bioprinted Inflammation Modulating Polymer Scaffolds for Soft Tissue Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 4, January 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intrinsic inflammation modulating bioscaffold is developed by 3D&#8208;bioprinting for surgical soft tissue repair. The bioscaffold is designed to sequester proinflammatory cytokines and acts as an inflammation trap. In vivo studies in a rat ventral hernia model demonstrate the enhanced efficacy of the bioscaffold by inhibiting formation of visceral adhesions and minimizing postsurgical complications.








Abstract
Development of inflammation modulating polymer scaffolds for soft tissue repair with minimal postsurgical complications is a compelling clinical need. However, the current standard of care soft tissue repair meshes for hernia repair is highly inflammatory and initiates a dysregulated inflammatory process causing visceral adhesions and postsurgical complications. Herein, the development of an inflammation modulating biomaterial scaffold (bioscaffold) for soft tissue repair is presented. The bioscaffold design is based on the idea that, if the excess proinflammatory cytokines are sequestered from the site of injury by the surgical implantation of a bioscaffold, the inflammatory response can be modulated, and the visceral adhesion formations and postsurgical complications can be minimized. The bioscaffold is fabricated by 3D&#8208;bioprinting of an in situ phosphate crosslinked poly(vinyl alcohol) polymer. In vivo efficacy of the bioscaffold is evaluated in a rat ventral hernia model. In vivo proinflammatory cytokine expression analysis and histopathological analysis of the tissues have confirmed that the bioscaffold acts as an inflammation trap and captures the proinflammatory cytokines secreted at the implant site and effectively modulates the local inflammation without the need for exogenous anti&#8208;inflammatory agents. The bioscaffold is very effective in inhibiting visceral adhesions formation and minimizing postsurgical complications.

&lt;p&gt;An intrinsic inflammation modulating bioscaffold is developed by 3D&#8208;bioprinting for surgical soft tissue repair. The bioscaffold is designed to sequester proinflammatory cytokines and acts as an inflammation trap. In vivo studies in a rat ventral hernia model demonstrate the enhanced efficacy of the bioscaffold by inhibiting formation of visceral adhesions and minimizing postsurgical complications.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Development of inflammation modulating polymer scaffolds for soft tissue repair with minimal postsurgical complications is a compelling clinical need. However, the current standard of care soft tissue repair meshes for hernia repair is highly inflammatory and initiates a dysregulated inflammatory process causing visceral adhesions and postsurgical complications. Herein, the development of an inflammation modulating biomaterial scaffold (bioscaffold) for soft tissue repair is presented. The bioscaffold design is based on the idea that, if the excess proinflammatory cytokines are sequestered from the site of injury by the surgical implantation of a bioscaffold, the inflammatory response can be modulated, and the visceral adhesion formations and postsurgical complications can be minimized. The bioscaffold is fabricated by 3D&#8208;bioprinting of an in situ phosphate crosslinked poly(vinyl alcohol) polymer. In vivo efficacy of the bioscaffold is evaluated in a rat ventral hernia model. In vivo proinflammatory cytokine expression analysis and histopathological analysis of the tissues have confirmed that the bioscaffold acts as an inflammation trap and captures the proinflammatory cytokines secreted at the implant site and effectively modulates the local inflammation without the need for exogenous anti&#8208;inflammatory agents. The bioscaffold is very effective in inhibiting visceral adhesions formation and minimizing postsurgical complications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Magnetic Moments Induced by Atomic Vacancies in Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Flakes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 4, January 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Localized magnetic moments induced by Pt vacancies in air&#8208;stable non&#8208;magnetic PtSe2 nanoflakes are reported and the induced magnetic moments in PtSe2 nanoflakes are found to be nearly thickness dependent in thinner nanoflakes. These findings demonstrate a new way to induce magnetism in nonmagnetic 2D materials.








Abstract
2D magnetism plays a key role in both fundamental physics and potential device applications. However, the instability of the discovered 2D magnetic materials has been one main obstacle in deep research and potential application of 2D magnetism. Here, a localized magnetic moment induced by Pt vacancies in air&#8208;stable type&#8208;II Dirac semimetal PtSe2 flakes is reported. The localized magnetic moments give rise to the Kondo effect, evidenced by logarithmic increment of resistance with decreasing temperature and isotropic negative longitudinal magnetoresistance. Additionally, the induced magnetic moment and Kondo temperature appear to depend on thickness in the thinner samples (&lt;10&#160;nm). The small magnetocrystalline anisotropy revealed by first&#8208;principles calculation indicates that the magnetic moments are randomly localized instead of long&#8208;range ordered. The findings demonstrate a new means to induce magnetism in 2D non&#8208;magnetic materials.

         <title>Ultrasoft and High&#8208;Mobility Block Copolymers for Skin&#8208;Compatible Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 4, January 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triblock copolymers (TBCs) comprising a high&#8208;performance polymer semiconductor endcapped with soft elastomeric chains can phase segregate at the nanoscale, while preserving the properties of the individual blocks. The TBCs are ultrasoft (5 MPa), electronically functional (0.1 cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1), stretchable and durable, and maintain conductivity after 1500 cycles to 50% strain in a doped state.








Abstract
Polymer semiconductors (PSCs) are an essential component of organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs), but their potential for stretchable electronics is limited by their brittleness and failure susceptibility upon strain. Herein, a covalent connection of two state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polymers&#8212;semiconducting poly&#8208;diketo&#8208;pyrrolopyrrole&#8208;thienothiophene (PDPP&#8208;TT) and elastomeric poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS)&#8212;in a single triblock copolymer (TBC) chain is reported, which enables high charge carrier mobility and low modulus in one system. Three TBCs containing up to 65 wt% PDMS were obtained, and the TBC with 65 wt% PDMS content exhibits mobilities up to 0.1 cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1, in the range of the fully conjugated reference polymer PDPP&#8208;TT (0.7 cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1). The TBC is ultrasoft with a low elastic modulus (5 MPa) in the range of mammalian tissue. The TBC exhibits an excellent stretchability and extraordinary durability, fully maintaining the initial electric conductivity in a doped state after 1500 cycles to 50% strain.

         <title>Gate&#8208;Tunable Polar Optical Phonon to Piezoelectric Scattering in Few&#8208;Layer Bi2O2Se for High&#8208;Performance Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 4, January 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thermoelectric (TE) transport in few&#8208;layer Bi2O2Se is probed, where gating can effectively modulate its scattering mechanism from polar optical phonon to piezoelectric scattering. This facilitates the capacity of drastic mobility engineering, and high TE performance over a wide range of temperature can be achieved due to the persistently high mobility arising from the highly gate&#8208;tunable scattering mechanism.








Abstract
Atomically thin Bi2O2Se has emerged as a new member in 2D materials with ultrahigh carrier mobility and excellent air&#8208;stability, showing great potential for electronics and optoelectronics. In addition, its ferroelectric nature renders an ultralow thermal conductivity, making it a perfect candidate for thermoelectrics. In this work, the thermoelectric performance of 2D Bi2O2Se is investigated over a wide temperature range (20&#8211;300 K). A gate&#8208;tunable transition from polar optical phonon (POP) scattering to piezoelectric scattering is observed, which facilitates the capacity of drastic mobility engineering in 2D Bi2O2Se. Consequently, a high power factor of more than 400&#160;&#181;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;2 over an unprecedented temperature range (80&#8211;200 K) is achieved, corresponding to the persistently high mobility arising from the highly gate&#8208;tunable scattering mechanism. This finding provides a new avenue for maximizing thermoelectric performance by changing the scattering mechanism and carrier mobility over a wide temperature range.

         <title>Gigantic Current Control of Coercive Field and Magnetic Memory Based on Nanometer&#8208;Thin Ferromagnetic van der Waals Fe3GeTe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 4, January 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substantial coercivity reduction by the current, larger at least by two orders of magnitude than those in previous reports, is found in the van der Waals ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2. It is theoretically shown to arise from an unusual type of gigantic spin&#8211;orbit torque, which itself is directly related to its special symmetries, large Berry curvature, and band topology. A working model of a new robust nonvolatile magnetic memory based on Fe3GeTe2, controlled by a much smaller current, is also produced.








Abstract
Controlling magnetic states by a small current is essential for the next&#8208;generation of energy&#8208;efficient spintronic devices. However, it invariably requires considerable energy to change a magnetic ground state of intrinsically quantum nature governed by fundamental Hamiltonian, once stabilized below a phase&#8208;transition temperature. Here, it is reported that, surprisingly, an in&#8208;plane current can tune the magnetic state of the nanometer&#8208;thin van der Waals ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2 from a hard magnetic state to a soft magnetic state. It is a direct demonstration of the current&#8208;induced substantial reduction of the coercive field. This surprising finding is possible because the in&#8208;plane current produces a highly unusual type of gigantic spin&#8211;orbit torque for Fe3GeTe2. In addition, a working model of a new nonvolatile magnetic memory based on the principle of the discovery in Fe3GeTe2, controlled by a tiny current, is further demonstrated. The findings open up a new window of exciting opportunities for magnetic van der Waals materials with potentially huge impact on the future development of spintronic and magnetic memory.

         <title>Activatable Polymer Nanoenzymes for Photodynamic Immunometabolic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 4, January 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An activatable organic nanoenzyme (SPNK) is developed for photodynamic immunometabolic cancer therapy. Near&#8208;infrared photoirradiation of SPNK can not only induce immunogenic cell death by photodynamic therapy but also activate kynureninase to in situ degrade immunosuppressive kynurenine, leading to enhanced systemic antitumor immunity and inhibition of both primary and distant tumors.








Abstract
Tumor immunometabolism contributes substantially to tumor proliferation and immune cell activity, and thus plays a crucial role in the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. Modulation of immunometabolism to boost cancer immunotherapy is mostly based on small&#8208;molecule inhibitors, which often encounter the issues of off&#8208;target adverse effects, drug resistance, and unsustainable response. In contrast, enzymatic therapeutics can potentially bypass these limitations but has been less exploited. Herein, an organic polymer nanoenzyme (SPNK) with near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photoactivatable immunotherapeutic effects is reported for photodynamic immunometabolic therapy. SPNK is composed of a semiconducting polymer core conjugated with kynureninase (KYNase) via PEGylated singlet oxygen (1O2) cleavable linker. Upon NIR photoirradiation, SPNK generates 1O2 not only to exert photodynamic effect to induce the immunogenic cell death of cancer, but also to unleash KYNase and trigger its activity to degrade the immunosuppressive kynurenine (Kyn). Such a combinational effect mediated by SPNK promotes the proliferation and infiltration of effector T cells, enhances systemic antitumor T cell immunity, and ultimately permits inhibition of both primary and distant tumors in living mice. Therefore, this study provides a promising photodynamic approach toward remotely controlled enzymatic immunomodulation for improved anticancer therapy.

         <title>Covalent Graphene&#8208;MOF Hybrids for High&#8208;Performance Asymmetric Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 4, January 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile method for the preparation of  graphene/metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) hybrids with an amine&#8208;functionalized MOF and carboxylate&#8208;functionalized graphene via amide bonds for capacitance applications is demonstrated.








Abstract
In this work, the covalent attachment of an amine functionalized metal&#8208;organic framework (UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2&#160;= Zr6O4(OH)4(bdc&#8208;NH2)6; bdc&#8208;NH2&#160;= 2&#8208;amino&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzenedicarboxylate) (UiO&#8208;Universitetet i Oslo) to the basal&#8208;plane of carboxylate functionalized graphene (graphene acid = GA) via amide bonds is reported. The resultant GA@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 hybrid displayed a large specific surface area, hierarchical pores and an interconnected conductive network. The electrochemical characterizations demonstrated that the hybrid GA@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 acts as an effective charge storing material with a capacitance of up to 651 F g&#8722;1, significantly higher than traditional graphene&#8208;based materials. The results suggest that the amide linkage plays a key role in the formation of a &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure, which facilitates charge transfer and consequently offers good capacitance and cycling stability. Furthermore, to realize the practical feasibility, an asymmetric supercapacitor using a GA@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 positive electrode with Ti3C2TX MXene as the opposing electrode has been constructed. The cell is able to deliver a power density of up to 16&#160;kW kg&#8722;1 and an energy density of up to 73&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, which are comparable to several commercial devices such as Pb&#8208;acid and Ni/MH batteries. Under an intermediate level of loading, the device retained 88% of its initial capacitance after 10 000 cycles.

         <title>Identifying Ionic and Electronic Charge Transfer at Oxide Heterointerfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 4, January 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combined role of ionic and electronic charge transfer in oxide heterointerfaces (LaAlO3/SrTiO3) is investigated. New near&#8208;ambient&#8208;pressure X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy data proves a reversible Sr cation reconstruction under thermodynamic treatment to be responsible for lowered interface conductivity and enhanced magnetism under low temperatures. Ionic movement is found to be considerably higher and more influential than in the bulk.








Abstract
The ability to tailor oxide heterointerfaces has led to novel properties in low&#8208;dimensional oxide systems. A fundamental understanding of these properties is based on the concept of electronic charge transfer. However, the electronic properties of oxide heterointerfaces crucially depend on their ionic constitution and defect structure: ionic charges contribute to charge transfer and screening at oxide interfaces, triggering a thermodynamic balance of ionic and electronic structures. Quantitative understanding of the electronic and ionic roles regarding charge&#8208;transfer phenomena poses a central challenge. Here, the electronic and ionic structure is simultaneously investigated at the prototypical charge&#8208;transfer heterointerface, LaAlO3/SrTiO3. Applying in situ photoemission spectroscopy under oxygen ambient, ionic and electronic charge transfer is deconvoluted in response to the oxygen atmosphere at elevated temperatures. In this way, both the rich and variable chemistry of complex oxides and the associated electronic properties are equally embraced. The interfacial electron gas is depleted through an ionic rearrangement in the strontium cation sublattice when oxygen is applied, resulting in an inverse and reversible balance between cation vacancies and electrons, while the mobility of ionic species is found to be considerably enhanced as compared to the bulk. Triggered by these ionic phenomena, the electronic transport and magnetic signature of the heterointerface are significantly altered.

Abstract
Despite their remarkable charge carrier mobility when forming well&#8208;ordered fibers, supramolecular transistors often suffer from poor processability that hinders device integration, resulting in disappointing transconductance and output currents. Here, a new class of supramolecular transistors, &#960;&#8208;ion gel transistors (PIGTs), is presented. An in situ &#960;&#8208;ion gel, which is an unprecedented composite of semiconducting nanofibers and an enclosed ionic liquid, is directly employed as an active material and internal capacitor. In comparison to other supramolecular transistors, a PIGT displays a high transconductance (133 &#181;S) and output current (139 &#181;A at &#8722;6 V), while retaining a high charge&#8208;carrier mobility (4.2 &#215; 10&#8722;2 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) and on/off ratio (3.7 &#215; 104). Importantly, the unique device configuration and the high ionic conductivity associated with the distinct nanosegregation enables the fastest response among accumulation&#8208;mode electrochemical&#8208;based transistors (&lt;20 &#181;s). Considering the advantages of the absence of dielectric layers and the facile fabrication process, PIGT has great potential to be utilized in printed flexible devices. The device platform is widely applicable to various supramolecular assemblies, shedding light on the interdisciplinary research of supramolecular chemistry and organic electronics.

         <title>A Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium/Carbon Nanotube Hybrid for Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 4, January 27, 2021. </description>

A dendrite&#8208;free Li/carbon nanotube (CNT) hybrid is fabricated by direct coating of molten Li on CNTs for Li&#8208;metal  batteries. Favorable thermodynamic and kinetic conditions are a powerful force to drive the rapid lift upward and infusion of molten Li into CNTs network. The  obtained hybrid exhibits superstable function even at an ultrahigh current density.








Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal is promising in the next&#8208;generation energy storage systems. However, its practical application is still hindered by the poor cycling performance and serious safety issues for the consequence of dendritic Li. Herein, a dendrite&#8208;free Li/carbon nanotube (CNT) hybrid is proposed, which is fabricated by direct coating molten Li on CNTs, for Li&#8208;metal batteries. The favorable thermodynamic and kinetic conditions are the powerful force to drive the rapid lift upwards and infusion of molten Li into CNTs network, which is the key to form a uniform metallic layer in Li/CNTs hybrid. The obtained hybrid indicates super&#8208;stable functions even at an ultrahigh current density of 40&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for 2000 cycles with a stripping/plating capacity of 2 mAh cm&#8722;2 in symmetric cells. Subsequently, this hybrid also demonstrates a significantly decreased resistance, excellent cycling stability at high current density and flexibility in the full Li&#8208;S battery. This work provides valuable concepts in fabricating Li anodes toward Li&#8208;metal batteries and beyond for their high&#8208;level services.

         <title>Second Near&#8208;Infrared Photothermal Semiconducting Polymer Nanoadjuvant for Enhanced Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 4, January 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) photothermal semiconducting polymer nanoadjuvant is developed for enhanced cancer immunotherapy. Upon NIR&#8208;II photoirradiation, the nanoadjuvant exerts photothermal effect to induce immunogenic cell death and on&#8208;demand release of toll&#8208;like receptor agonist, which enhances dendritic cell maturation. A synergistic action of photothermal immunotherapy thus occurs to inhibit the growth of primary and distant tumors and eliminate lung metastasis.








Abstract
Immunotherapy has offered new treatment options for cancer; however, the therapeutic benefits are often modest and desired to be improved. A semiconducting polymer nanoadjuvant (SPNIIR) with a photothermally triggered cargo release for second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) photothermal immunotherapy is reported here. SPNIIR consists of a semiconducting polymer nanoparticle core as an NIR&#8208;II photothermal converter, which is doped with a toll&#8208;like receptor (TLR) agonist as an immunotherapy adjuvant and coated with a thermally responsive lipid shell. Upon NIR&#8208;II photoirradiation, SPNIIR effectively generates heat not only to ablate tumors and induce immunogenic cell death (ICD), but also to melt the lipid layers for on&#8208;demand release of the TLR agonist. The combination of ICD and activation of TLR7/TLR8 enhances the maturation of dendritic cells, which amplifies anti&#8208;tumor immune responses. Thus, a single treatment of SPNIIR&#8208;mediated NIR&#8208;II photothermal immunotherapy effectively inhibits growth of both primary and distant tumors and eliminates lung metastasis in a murine mouse model. This study thus provides a remote&#8208;controlled smart delivery system to synergize photomedicine with immunotherapy for enhanced cancer treatment.

         <title>In Operando Modulation of Rectification in Molecular Tunneling Junctions Comprising Reconfigurable Molecular Self&#8208;Assemblies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 4, January 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large&#8208;area molecular tunneling junctions embedded in microfluidic channels convert information encoded in chemical packets into electrical signals by reconstituting themselves through chemical exchange while in operation.








Abstract
The reconfiguration of molecular tunneling junctions during operation via the self&#8208;assembly of bilayers of glycol ethers is described. Well&#8208;established functional groups are used to modulate the magnitude and direction of rectification in assembled tunneling junctions by exposing them to solutions containing different glycol ethers. Variable&#8208;temperature measurements confirm that rectification occurs by the expected bias&#8208;dependent tunneling&#8211;hopping mechanism for these functional groups and that glycol ethers, besides being an unusually efficient tunneling medium, behave similarly to alkanes. Memory bits are fabricated from crossbar junctions prepared by injecting eutectic Ga&#8211;In (EGaIn) into microfluidic channels. The states of two 8&#8208;bit registers were set by trains of droplets such that they are able to perform logical AND operations on bit strings encoded into chemical packets that alter the composition of the crossbar junctions through self&#8208;assembly to effect memristor&#8208;like properties. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept work demonstrates the potential for fieldable devices based on molecular tunneling junctions comprising self&#8208;assembled monolayers and&#160;bilayers.

         <title>Strong Ferromagnetism Achieved via Breathing Lattices in Atomically Thin Cobaltites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 4, January 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically thin cobaltite remaining strongly ferromagnetic is achieved by local structural modification. A surprisingly large magnetic moment (0.5 &#956;B/Co) and Curie temperature (75 K), values larger than previously reported for any monolayer oxides, are observed in the LaCoO3 monolayer, demonstrating a strategy for creating functional quantum heterostructures by exploiting atomic interface engineering.








Abstract
Low&#8208;dimensional quantum materials that remain strongly ferromagnetic down to monolayer thickness are highly desired for spintronic applications. Although oxide materials are important candidates for the next generation of spintronics, ferromagnetism decays severely when the thickness is scaled to the nanometer regime, leading to deterioration of device performance. Here, a methodology is reported for maintaining strong ferromagnetism in insulating LaCoO3 (LCO) layers down to the thickness of a single unit cell. It is found that the magnetic and electronic states of LCO are linked intimately to the structural parameters of adjacent &#8220;breathing lattice&#8221; SrCuO2 (SCO). As the dimensionality of SCO is reduced, the lattice constant elongates over 10% along the growth direction, leading to a significant distortion of the CoO6 octahedra, and promoting a higher spin state and long&#8208;range spin ordering. For atomically thin LCO layers, surprisingly large magnetic moment (0.5 &#956;B/Co) and Curie temperature (75 K), values larger than previously reported for any monolayer oxides are observed. The results demonstrate a strategy for creating ultrathin ferromagnetic oxides by exploiting atomic heterointerface engineering, confinement&#8208;driven structural transformation, and spin&#8208;lattice entanglement in strongly correlated materials.

         <title>Recognition and Removal of Amyloid&#8208;&#946; by a Heteromultivalent Macrocyclic Coassembly: A Potential Strategy for the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 4, January 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heteromultivalent coassembly composed of cyclodextrin and calixarene (CD&#8211;CA coassembly) according to the composition of amino acids in A&#946;1&#8208;42 effectively recognizes and disaggregates A&#946;1&#8208;42 fibrils. Intranasal administration of the CD&#8211;CA coassembly eliminates amyloid plaque and neurodegeneration in the brain, and improves cognitive deficits in 5xFAD mice. This supramolecular approach is a promising novel strategy for treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD).








Abstract
The imbalance of amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) production and clearance causes aggregation of A&#946;1&#8208;42 monomers to form fibrils and amyloid plaques, which is an indispensable process in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and eventually leads to pathological changes and cognitive impairment. Consequently, A&#946;1&#8208;42 is the most important target for the treatment of AD. However, developing a single treatment method that can recognize A&#946;1&#8208;42, inhibit A&#946;1&#8208;42 fibrillation, eliminate amyloid plaques, improve cognitive impairments, and alleviate AD&#8208;like pathology is challenging. Here, a coassembly composed of cyclodextrin (CD) and calixarene (CA) is designed, and it is used as an anti&#8208;A&#946; therapy agent. The CD&#8211;CA coassembly is based on the previously reported heteromultivalent recognition strategy and is able to successfully eliminate amyloid plaques and degrade A&#946;1&#8208;42 monomers in 5xFAD mice. More importantly, the coassembly improves recognition and spatial cognition deficits, and synaptic plasticity impairment in the 5xFAD mice. In addition, the coassembly ameliorates AD&#8208;like pathology including prevention of neuronal apoptosis and oxidant stress, and alteration of M1/M2 microglial polarization states. This supramolecular approach makes full use of both molecular recognition and self&#8208;assembly of macrocyclic amphiphiles, and is a promising novel strategy for AD treatment.

&lt;p&gt;A heteromultivalent coassembly composed of cyclodextrin and calixarene (CD&#8211;CA coassembly) according to the composition of amino acids in A&#946;&lt;sub&gt;1&#8208;42&lt;/sub&gt; effectively recognizes and disaggregates A&#946;&lt;sub&gt;1&#8208;42&lt;/sub&gt; fibrils. Intranasal administration of the CD&#8211;CA coassembly eliminates amyloid plaque and neurodegeneration in the brain, and improves cognitive deficits in 5xFAD mice. This supramolecular approach is a promising novel strategy for treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD).


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The imbalance of amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) production and clearance causes aggregation of A&#946;&lt;sub&gt;1&#8208;42&lt;/sub&gt; monomers to form fibrils and amyloid plaques, which is an indispensable process in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and eventually leads to pathological changes and cognitive impairment. Consequently, A&#946;&lt;sub&gt;1&#8208;42&lt;/sub&gt; is the most important target for the treatment of AD. However, developing a single treatment method that can recognize A&#946;&lt;sub&gt;1&#8208;42&lt;/sub&gt;, inhibit A&#946;&lt;sub&gt;1&#8208;42&lt;/sub&gt; fibrillation, eliminate amyloid plaques, improve cognitive impairments, and alleviate AD&#8208;like pathology is challenging. Here, a coassembly composed of cyclodextrin (CD) and calixarene (CA) is designed, and it is used as an anti&#8208;A&#946; therapy agent. The CD&#8211;CA coassembly is based on the previously reported heteromultivalent recognition strategy and is able to successfully eliminate amyloid plaques and degrade A&#946;&lt;sub&gt;1&#8208;42&lt;/sub&gt; monomers in 5xFAD mice. More importantly, the coassembly improves recognition and spatial cognition deficits, and synaptic plasticity impairment in the 5xFAD mice. In addition, the coassembly ameliorates AD&#8208;like pathology including prevention of neuronal apoptosis and oxidant stress, and alteration of M1/M2 microglial polarization states. This supramolecular approach makes full use of both molecular recognition and self&#8208;assembly of macrocyclic amphiphiles, and is a promising novel strategy for AD treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Linear Electro&#8208;Optic Modulation in Highly Polarizable Organic Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 4, January 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The linear electro&#8208;optic (EO) effect in organic perovskites is demonstrated. The crystal structures and polarizability can be modified by the rational design of the organic components to realize an enhancement of the EO performance. This work provides a molecular perspective on the design of organic perovskites for EO modulation and new applications in nonlinear optics.








Abstract
Electrical&#8208;to&#8208;optical signal conversion is widely employed in information technology and is implemented using on&#8208;chip optical modulators. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art modulator technologies are incompatible with silicon manufacturing techniques: inorganic nonlinear crystals such as LiNbO3 are integrated with silicon photonic chips only using complex approaches, and hybrid silicon&#8211;LiNbO3 optical modulators show either low bandwidth or high operating voltage. Organic perovskites are solution&#8208;processed materials readily integrated with silicon photonics; and organic molecules embedded within the perovskite scaffold allow in principle for high polarizability. However, it is found that the large molecules required for high polarizability also require an increase of the size of the perovskite cavity: specifically, using the highly polarizable DR2+ (R = H, F, Cl) in the A site necessitates the exploration of new X&#8208;site options. Only by introducing BF4&#8211; as the X&#8208;site molecule is it possible to synthesize (DCl)(NH4)(BF4)3, a material exhibiting a linear EO coefficient of 20 pm V&#8211;1, which is 10 times higher than that of metal halide perovskites and is a 1.5 fold enhancement compared to reported organic perovskites. The EO response of the organic perovskite approaches that of LiNbO3 (reff&#160;&#8776; 30 pm V&#8211;1) and highlights the promise of rationally designed organic perovskites for use in efficient EO modulators.

         <title>Assembly of Multi&#8208;Spheroid Cellular Architectures by Programmable Droplet Merging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 4, January 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Artificial multicellular systems allow biological structures and behavior to be reconstituted in vitro in the field of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. In this work, a programmable droplet merging method is demonstrated for high&#8208;throughput generation of complex multi&#8208;spheroidal cellular architectures. The potential of this methodology is validated by studying the propagation of Wnt signaling within hetero&#8208;spheroids.








Abstract
Artificial multicellular systems are gaining importance in the field of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Reconstruction of complex tissue architectures in vitro is nevertheless challenging, and methods permitting controllable and high&#8208;throughput fabrication of complex multicellular architectures are needed. Here, a facile and high&#8208;throughput method is developed based on a tunable droplet&#8208;fusion technique, allowing programmed assembly of multiple cell spheroids into complex multicellular architectures. The droplet&#8208;fusion technique allows for construction of various multicellular architectures (double&#8208;spheroids, multi&#8208;spheroids, hetero&#8208;spheroids) in a miniaturized high&#8208;density array format. As an example of application, the propagation of Wnt signaling is investigated within hetero&#8208;spheroids formed from two fused Wnt&#8208;releasing and Wnt&#8208;reporter cell spheroids. The developed method provides an approach for miniaturized, high&#8208;throughput construction of complex 3D multicellular architectures and can be applied for studying various biological processes including cell signaling, cancer invasion, embryogenesis, and neural development.

         <title>Charge Transfer: Identifying Ionic and Electronic Charge Transfer at Oxide Heterointerfaces (Adv. Mater. 4/2021)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 4, January 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In article number 2004132, Marc&#8208;Andr&#233; Rose,  David N. Mueller, Felix Gunkel, and co&#8208;workers identify how ion and electron transfer naturally balance at the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 oxide heterointerface, affecting the band alignment and magnetic signature of the interface. They utilize near&#8208;ambient&#8208;pressure X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, showing that Sr ions are more mobile at the interface than in the bulk, and implicating a high importance of ionic charge transfer in oxide heterostructures.

         <title>Thermoelectric Materials: Gate&#8208;Tunable Polar Optical Phonon to Piezoelectric Scattering in Few&#8208;Layer Bi2O2Se for High&#8208;Performance Thermoelectrics (Adv. Mater. 4/2021)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 4, January 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy of tuning the scattering mechanism to decouple electric conductivity with Seebeck coefficient for high&#8208;performance thermoelectrics is realized by Jing Wu, Junpeng Lu, Zhenhua Ni, and co&#8208;workers, as described in article number 2004786. By applying a gate voltage on a 2D Bi2O2Se&#8208;based field&#8208;effect transistor, a high thermoelectric power factor over a wide temperature range is achieved due to persistently high mobility arising from the highly gate&#8208;tunable scattering mechanism.

         <title>Ferromagnetic Materials: Strong Ferromagnetism Achieved via Breathing Lattices in Atomically Thin Cobaltites (Adv. Mater. 4/2021)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 4, January 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In article number 2001324, the authors report the achievement of strong ferromagnetism in atomically thin cobaltite by local structural modification, where a surprisingly large magnetic moment and Curie temperature are observed. Thus, a strategy for creating functional quantum heterostructures by exploiting atomic interface engineering is demonstrated.

The  hybrid GA@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 acts as an effective charge&#8208;storing material with a remarkable capacitance. They construct an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) using GA@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 as the positive electrode, with Ti3C2Tx MXene as negative electrode.

         <title>Ferromagnetic Materials: Gigantic Current Control of Coercive Field and Magnetic Memory Based on Nanometer&#8208;Thin Ferromagnetic van der Waals Fe3GeTe2 (Adv. Mater. 4/2021)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 4, January 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In article number 2004110, Kaixuan Zhang, Hyun&#8208;Woo Lee, Je&#8208;Geun Park, and co&#8208;workers report gigantic current control of the coercive field in the van der Waals ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2. This results from an unusual type of gigantic spin&#8211;orbit torque (SOT) within Fe3GeTe2 itself, which is directly related to its special symmetries, large Berry curvature, and band topology. The current&#8208;induced SOT substantially changes the energy profile ball and suppresses the energy barrier, creating an easy path for magnetization switching and pushing the hard ferromagnet loop to a soft one. Such an effect will be extremely useful for magnetic memory and spintronics.

&lt;p&gt;In article number &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202004110"&gt;2004110&lt;/a&gt;, Kaixuan Zhang, Hyun&#8208;Woo Lee, Je&#8208;Geun Park, and co&#8208;workers report gigantic current control of the coercive field in the van der Waals ferromagnet Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;GeTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This results from an unusual type of gigantic spin&#8211;orbit torque (SOT) within Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;GeTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; itself, which is directly related to its special symmetries, large Berry curvature, and band topology. The current&#8208;induced SOT substantially changes the energy profile ball and suppresses the energy barrier, creating an easy path for magnetization switching and pushing the hard ferromagnet loop to a soft one. Such an effect will be extremely useful for magnetic memory and spintronics.

         <title>Trends in Micro&#8208;/Nanorobotics: Materials Development, Actuation, Localization, and System Integration for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 4, January 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design and fabrication, functionalization, actuation, and tracking of individual and a swarm of micro/nanorobots are an indispensable part for achieving biomedical applications. How to combine and integrate all the four aspects together and realize a biomedical therapeutic function using the micro&#8208;/nanorobotic strategy is discussed.








Abstract
Micro&#8208;/nanorobots (m&#8208;bots) have attracted significant interest due to their suitability for applications in biomedical engineering and environmental remediation. Particularly, their applications in in vivo diagnosis and intervention have been the focus of extensive research in recent years with various clinical imaging techniques being applied for localization and tracking. The successful integration of well&#8208;designed m&#8208;bots with surface functionalization, remote actuation systems, and imaging techniques becomes the crucial step toward biomedical applications, especially for the in vivo uses. This review thus addresses four different aspects of biomedical m&#8208;bots: design/fabrication, functionalization, actuation, and localization. The biomedical applications of the m&#8208;bots in diagnosis, sensing, microsurgery, targeted drug/cell delivery, thrombus ablation, and wound healing are reviewed from these viewpoints. The developed biomedical m&#8208;bot systems are comprehensively compared and evaluated based on their characteristics. The current challenges and the directions of future research in this field are summarized.

         <title>Recent Advances in Hyperthermia Therapy&#8208;Based Synergistic Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 4, January 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanomaterial&#8208;based hyperthermia therapy (HTT) including photothermal therapy and magnetic hyperthermia can not only ablate different types of primary tumors, but also sensitize tumors to create a highly immunogenic tumor microenvironment for immunotherapy to further fight against cancer metastasis and recurrence. Hence, such an HTT&#8208;synergized immunotherapy approach offers a powerful method for curing cancer completely.








Abstract
The past decades have witnessed hyperthermia therapy (HTT) as an emerging strategy against malignant tumors. Nanomaterial&#8208;based photothermal therapy (PTT) and magnetic hyperthermia (MHT), as highly effective and noninvasive treatment models, offer advantages over other strategies in the treatment of different types of tumors. However, both PTT and MHT cannot completely cure cancer due to recurrence and distal metastasis. In recent years, cancer immunotherapy has attracted widespread attention owing to its capability to activate the body's own natural defense to identify, attack, and eradicate cancer cells. Significant efforts have been devoted to studying the activated immune responses caused by hyperthermia&#8208;ablated tumors. In this article, the synergistic mechanism of HTT in immunotherapy, including immunogenic cell death and reversal of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment is discussed. The reports of the combination of HTT or HTT&#8208;based multimodal therapy with immunotherapy, including immunoadjuvant exploitation, immune checkpoint blockade therapy, and adoptive cellular immunotherapy are summarized. As highlighted, these strategies could achieve synergistically enhanced therapeutic outcomes against both primary tumors and metastatic lesions, prevent cancer recurrence, and prolong the survival period. Finally, current challenges and prospective developments in HTT&#8208;synergized immunotherapy are also reviewed.

         <title>Accelerated Development of Colloidal Nanomaterials Enabled by Modular Microfluidic Reactors: Toward Autonomous Robotic Experimentation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 4, January 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In recent years, microfluidic technologies have increasingly been applied toward accelerated synthesis science studies of solution&#8208;processed nanomaterials, allowing greater control over synthesis conditions, lower reagent consumption, and unique data access through online monitoring techniques. Adoption of microfluidic synthesis technologies offers potential access to higher&#8208;performing nanomaterials through autonomous robotic experimentation.








Abstract
In recent years, microfluidic technologies have emerged as a powerful approach for the advanced synthesis and rapid optimization of various solution&#8208;processed nanomaterials, including semiconductor quantum dots and nanoplatelets, and metal plasmonic and reticular framework nanoparticles. These fluidic systems offer access to previously unattainable measurements and synthesis conditions at unparalleled efficiencies and sampling rates. Despite these advantages, microfluidic systems have yet to be extensively adopted by the colloidal nanomaterial community. To help bridge the gap, this progress report details the basic principles of microfluidic reactor design and performance, as well as the current state of online diagnostics and autonomous robotic experimentation strategies, toward the size, shape, and composition&#8208;controlled synthesis of various colloidal nanomaterials. By discussing the application of fluidic platforms in recent high&#8208;priority colloidal nanomaterial studies and their potential for integration with rapidly emerging artificial intelligence&#8208;based decision&#8208;making strategies, this report seeks to encourage interdisciplinary collaborations between microfluidic reactor engineers and colloidal nanomaterial chemists. Full convergence of these two research efforts offers significantly expedited and enhanced nanomaterial discovery, optimization, and manufacturing.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 4, January 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Emerging 2D and metal halide perovskite light&#8208;emitting materials for photonic integration are reviewed, including their unique optical properties, fabrication methods, and the progress made in realizing on&#8208;chip light emitters based on these materials. Moreover, the existing challenges and future perspectives are discussed toward the realization of high&#8208;efficiency light sources for optical interconnections.








Abstract
The arrival of the information explosion era is urging the development of large&#8208;bandwidth high&#8208;data&#8208;rate optical interconnection technology. Up to now, the biggest stumbling block in optical interconnections has been the lack of efficient light sources despite significant progress that has been made in germanium&#8208;on&#8208;silicon (Ge&#8208;on&#8208;Si) and III&#8208;V&#8208;on&#8208;silicon (III&#8208;V&#8208;on&#8208;Si) lasers. 2D materials and metal halide perovskites have attracted much attention in recent years, and exhibit distinctive advantages in the application of on&#8208;chip light emitters. Herein, this Progress Report reviews the recent progress made in light&#8208;emitting materials with a focus on new materials, i.e., 2D materials and metal halide perovskites. The report briefly introduces the current status of Ge&#8208;on&#8208;Si and III&#8208;V&#8208;on&#8208;Si lasers and discusses the advances of 2D and perovskite light&#8208;emitting materials for photonic integration, including their optical properties, preparation methods, as well as the light sources based on these materials. Finally, challenges and perspectives of these emerging materials on the way to the efficient light sources are discussed.

         <title>State&#8208;Of&#8208;The&#8208;Art and Future Challenges in High Energy Lithium&#8211;Selenium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Li&#8211;Se batteries (LSeBs) have garnered intensive attention since Se cathode possesses high capacity and electronic conductivity. LSeBs experience a solid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transformation accompanied by side reactions in carbonate electrolytes while multiphase conversion in ether&#8208;based ones. The advances for cathode design, blocking layer engineering, and emerging solid&#8208;state electrolytes are summarized. The future research directions are also outlined to motivate more insightful works.








Abstract
Li&#8208;chalcogen batteries, especially the Li&#8211;S batteries (LSBs), have received paramount interests as next generation energy storage techniques because of their high theoretical energy densities. However, the associated challenges need to be overcome prior to their commercialization. Elemental selenium, another chalcogen member, would be an attractive alternative to sulfur owing to its higher electronic conductivity, comparable capacity density, and moreover, excellent compatibility with carbonate electrolytes. Unlike LSBs, the research and development of Li&#8211;Se batteries (LSeBs) have garnered burgeoning attention but are still in their infant stage, where a comprehensive yet in&#8208;depth overview is highly imperative to guide future research. Herein, a critical review of LSeBs, in terms of the underlying mechanisms, cathode design, blocking layer engineering, and emerging solid&#8208;state electrolytes is provided. First, the electrolyte&#8208;dependent electrochemistry of LSeBs is discussed.

&lt;p&gt;Li&#8211;Se batteries (LSeBs) have garnered intensive attention since Se cathode possesses high capacity and electronic conductivity. LSeBs experience a solid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transformation accompanied by side reactions in carbonate electrolytes while multiphase conversion in ether&#8208;based ones. The advances for cathode design, blocking layer engineering, and emerging solid&#8208;state electrolytes are summarized. The future research directions are also outlined to motivate more insightful works.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Li&#8208;chalcogen batteries, especially the Li&#8211;S batteries (LSBs), have received paramount interests as next generation energy storage techniques because of their high theoretical energy densities. However, the associated challenges need to be overcome prior to their commercialization. Elemental selenium, another chalcogen member, would be an attractive alternative to sulfur owing to its higher electronic conductivity, comparable capacity density, and moreover, excellent compatibility with carbonate electrolytes. Unlike LSBs, the research and development of Li&#8211;Se batteries (LSeBs) have garnered burgeoning attention but are still in their infant stage, where a comprehensive yet in&#8208;depth overview is highly imperative to guide future research. Herein, a critical review of LSeBs, in terms of the underlying mechanisms, cathode design, blocking layer engineering, and emerging solid&#8208;state electrolytes is provided. First, the electrolyte&#8208;dependent electrochemistry of LSeBs is discussed. Second, the advances in Se&#8208;based cathodes are comprehensively summarized, especially highlighting the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Se&lt;i&gt;

Third, the versatile separators/interlayers optimization and interface regulation are outlined, with a particular focus on the emerging solid&#8208;state electrolytes for advanced LSeBs.

         <title>Heterogeneous Hydrogel Structures with Spatiotemporal Reconfigurability using Addressable and Tunable Voxels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Creating hyper&#8208;redundant miniaturized soft robots with multiple active degrees of freedom is challenging. Using building blocks called soft voxel actuators (SVAs) in a muscle&#8208;inspire bottom&#8208;up manufacturing strategy, hyper&#8208;redundant soft robots are created demonstrating spatiotemporal reconfigurability and thus ability to work in unstructured environments. A facile mixed&#8208;solvent photopolymerization developed for poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) hydrogels, supports the mass production of SVAs.








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive hydrogels can sense environmental cues and change their volume accordingly without the need for additional sensors or actuators. This enables a significant reduction in the size and complexity of resulting devices. However, since the responsive volume change of hydrogels is typically uniform, their robotic applications requiring localized and time&#8208;varying deformations have been challenging to realize. Here, using addressable and tunable hydrogel building blocks&#8212;referred to as soft voxel actuators (SVAs)&#8212;heterogeneous hydrogel structures with programmable spatiotemporal deformations are presented. SVAs are produced using a mixed&#8208;solvent photopolymerization method, utilizing a fast reaction speed and the cononsolvency property of poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm) to produce highly interconnected hydrogel pore structures, resulting in tunable swelling ratio, swelling rate, and Young's modulus in a simple, one&#8208;step casting process that is compatible with mass production of SVA units. By designing the location and swelling properties of each voxel and by activating embedded Joule heaters in the voxels, spatiotemporal deformations are achieved, which enables heterogeneous hydrogel structures to manipulate objects, avoid obstacles, generate traveling waves, and morph to different shapes. Together, these innovations pave the way toward tunable, untethered, and high&#8208;degree&#8208;of&#8208;freedom hydrogel robots that can adapt and respond to changing conditions in unstructured&#160;environments.

         <title>Ultrathin Amorphous/Crystalline Heterophase Rh and Rh Alloy Nanosheets as Tandem Catalysts for Direct Indole Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin Rh and RhM (M = Cu, Zn, Ru) alloy nanosheets with amorphous/crystalline heterophases are successfully synthesized. In tandem catalysis to directly synthesize indole, the amorphous/crystalline heterophase Rh nanosheets (NSs) outperform their crystalline counterpart, demonstrating much higher catalytic activity. Impressively, the amorphous/crystalline heterophase RhCu NSs show dramatically enhanced indole selectivity of over 99.9% and excellent activity.








Abstract
Heterogeneous noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysis plays an essential role in the production of fine chemicals. Rh&#8208;based catalysts are one of the most active candidates for indole synthesis. However, it is still highly desired to develop heterogeneous Rh&#8208;based catalysts with high activity and selectivity. In this work, a general, facile wet&#8208;chemical method is reported to synthesize ultrathin amorphous/crystalline heterophase Rh and Rh&#8208;based bimetallic alloy nanosheets (NSs), including RhCu, RhZn, and RhRu. Impressively, the amorphous/crystalline heterophase Rh NSs exhibit enhanced catalytic activity toward the direct synthesis of indole compared to the crystalline counterpart. Importantly, the obtained amorphous/crystalline heterophase RhCu alloy NSs can further enhance the selectivity to indole of &gt;99.9% and the conversion is 100%. This work demonstrates the importance of phase engineering and metal alloying in the rational design and synthesis of tandem heterogeneous catalysts toward fine chemical synthesis.

         <title>Design Strategy for Transformative Electronic System toward Rapid, Bidirectional Stiffness Tuning using Graphene and Flexible Thermoelectric Device Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transformative electronics capable of rapid bidirectional stiffness tuning are developed to provide adaptive rigid and soft interfaces for versatile applications. Integration of graphene and a flexible thermoelectric device with a gallium platform facilitates solid&#8211;liquid phase transition of gallium, enabling accelerated rigid&#8211;soft transformation. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of reconfigurable personal electronics shows the potential of this approach, which can significantly enhance the versatility of electronics.








Abstract
Electronics with tunable shape and stiffness can be applied in broad range of applications because their tunability allows their use in either rigid handheld form or soft wearable form, depending on needs. Previous research has enabled such reconfigurable electronics by integrating a thermally tunable gallium&#8208;based platform with flexible/stretchable electronics. However, supercooling phenomenon caused in the freezing process of gallium impedes reliable and rapid bidirectional rigid&#8211;soft conversion, limiting the full potential of this type of &#8220;transformative&#8221; electronics. Here, materials and electronics design strategies are reported to develop a transformative system with a gallium platform capable of fast reversible mechanical switching. In this electronic system, graphene is used as a catalyst to accelerate the heterogeneous nucleation of gallium to mitigate the degree of supercooling. Additionally, a flexible thermoelectric device is integrated as a means to provide active temperature control to further reduce the time for the solid&#8211;liquid transition of gallium. Analytical and experimental results establish the fundamentals for the design and optimized operation of transformative electronics for accelerated bidirectional transformation. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of a reconfigurable system, which can convert between rigid handheld electronics and a flexible wearable biosensor, demonstrates the potential of this design approach for highly versatile electronics that can support multiple applications.

         <title>Designing the Bending Stiffness of 2D Material Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interfacial engineering is used to tune the bending stiffness of 2D material heterostructures composed of graphene and MoS2 by over several hundred percent. The incorporation of twisted or heterointerfaces facilitates interlayer slip, which dramatically softens the 2D stacks. A bending model is developed to predict and design the deformability of 2D heterostructures as a function of composition, stacking order, and geometry of the structure.








Abstract
2D monolayers represent some of the most deformable inorganic materials, with bending stiffnesses approaching those of lipid bilayers. Achieving 2D heterostructures with similar properties would enable a new class of deformable devices orders of magnitude softer than conventional thin&#8208;film electronics. Here, by systematically introducing low&#8208;friction twisted or heterointerfaces, interfacial engineering is leveraged to tailor the bending stiffness of 2D heterostructures over several hundred percent. A bending model is developed and experimentally validated to predict and design the deformability of 2D heterostructures and how it evolves with the composition of the stack, the atomic arrangements at the interfaces, and the geometry of the structure. Notably, when each atomic layer is separated by heterointerfaces, the total bending stiffness reaches a theoretical minimum, equal to the sum of the constituent layers regardless of scale of deformation&#8212;lending the extreme deformability of 2D monolayers to device&#8208;compatible&#160;multilayers.

         <title>Combination of Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic Water Oxidation with Selective Oxygenation of Organic Substrates using Manganese Borophosphates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helical manganese borophosphates are employed to address two highly demanding yet kinetically controlled reactions: durable electrochemical water oxidation to efficiently produce molecular oxygen and the selective oxygenation of organics to deliver prominent value&#8208;added chemicals.








Abstract
One of the key catalytic reactions for life on earth, the oxidation of water to molecular oxygen, occurs in the oxygen&#8208;evolving complex of the photosystem II (PSII) mediated by a manganese&#8208;containing cluster.

&lt;p&gt;Helical manganese borophosphates are employed to address two highly demanding yet kinetically controlled reactions: durable electrochemical water oxidation to efficiently produce molecular oxygen and the selective oxygenation of organics to deliver prominent value&#8208;added chemicals.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the key catalytic reactions for life on earth, the oxidation of water to molecular oxygen, occurs in the oxygen&#8208;evolving complex of the photosystem II (PSII) mediated by a manganese&#8208;containing cluster. Considerable efforts in this research area embrace the development of efficient artificial manganese&#8208;based catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Using artificial OER catalysts for selective oxygenation of organic substrates to produce value&#8208;added chemicals is a worthwhile objective. However, unsatisfying catalytic performance and poor stability have been a fundamental bottleneck in the field of artificial PSII analogs.

         <title>Bioorthogonal Coordination Polymer Nanoparticles with Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission for Deep Tumor&#8208;Penetrating Radio&#8208; and Radiodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coordination polymer nanoparticles constructed from a photosensitizer with aggregation&#8208;induced emission property (AIE PS) and the high&#8208;Z element hafnium (Hf) is fabricated through a solvothermal method. After PEGylation followed by bioorthogonal click chemistry, Hf&#8208;AIE&#8208;PEG&#8208;DBCO (PEG: poly(ethylene glycol); DBCO: dibenzocyclooctyne) can react on the surface of tumor cells to realize deep tumor&#8208;penetrating radiotherapy and radiodynamic therapy with enhanced tumor accumulation and extended tumor retention.








Abstract
Radiodynamic therapy (RDT), an emerging therapeutic approach for cancer treatment by employing ionizing irradiation to induce localized photodynamic therapy (PDT) can overcome the drawbacks of the limited penetration depth for traditional PDT and the unconcentrated energy in the tumor for traditional radiotherapy (RT). Taking advantage of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) photosensitizers with bright fluorescence and efficient singlet oxygen production in the aggregate state, Hf&#8208;AIE coordination polymer nanoparticles (CPNs), which show both strong RT and RDT effect under X&#8208;ray irradiation, are developed. Furthermore, to enhance the tumor accumulation and prolong the tumor retention of the CPNs, bioorthogonal click chemistry is applied in the system through coupling between dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO)&#8208;modified CPNs (Hf&#8208;AIE&#8208;PEG&#8208;DBCO) (PEG: poly(ethylene glycol)) and azide groups on the cell membrane formed by metabolic glycoengineering. Thanks to the high penetration of X&#8208;ray irradiation, the bioorthogonal&#8208;assisted RT and RDT combination therapy realizes significant killing of cancer cells without showing noticeable biotoxicity after intravenous administration of CPNs.

         <title>Materials Screening for Disorder&#8208;Controlled Chalcogenide Crystals for Phase&#8208;Change Memory Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ab initio simulations and transport experiments elucidate why Sb2Te3 can form an insulating rocksalt structure, extending the exploration of Anderson insulators to binary chalcogenides. A systematic computational screening over binary and ternary chalcogenides, which leads to an in&#8208;depth understanding of the critical factors that affect the stability of the rocksalt structure is also carried out.








Abstract
Tailoring the degree of disorder in chalcogenide phase&#8208;change materials (PCMs) plays an essential role in nonvolatile memory devices and neuro&#8208;inspired computing. Upon rapid crystallization from the amorphous phase, the flagship Ge&#8211;Sb&#8211;Te PCMs form metastable rocksalt&#8208;like structures with an unconventionally high concentration of vacancies, which results in disordered crystals exhibiting Anderson&#8208;insulating transport behavior. Here, ab initio simulations and transport experiments are combined to extend these concepts to the parent compound of Ge&#8211;Sb&#8211;Te alloys, viz., binary Sb2Te3, in the metastable rocksalt&#8208;type modification. Then a systematic computational screening over a wide range of homologous, binary and ternary chalcogenides, elucidating the critical factors that affect the stability of the rocksalt structure is carried out. The findings vastly expand the family of disorder&#8208;controlled main&#8208;group chalcogenides toward many more compositions with a tunable bandgap size for demanding phase&#8208;change applications, as well as a varying strength of spin&#8211;orbit interaction for the exploration of potential topological Anderson insulators.

         <title>Optical Microfluidic Waveguides and Solution Lasers of Colloidal Semiconductor Quantum Wells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solution of semiconductor quantum wells (CQWs) colloidally synthesized and used as the gain medium in a capillary microfluidic waveguide yields record low optical gain threshold in solution. A Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot cavity was&#160;created between metallized sidewalls of the ends of microfluidic channel and optically pumped along the side of the waveguide to generate a single&#8208;mode output laser beam.








Abstract
The realization of high&#8208;quality lasers in microfluidic devices is crucial for numerous applications, including biological and chemical sensors and flow cytometry, and the development of advanced lab&#8208;on&#8208;chip (LOC) devices. Herein, an ultralow&#8208;threshold microfluidic single&#8208;mode laser is proposed and demonstrated using an on&#8208;chip cavity. CdSe/CdS@CdxZn1&#8722;xS core/crown@gradient&#8208;alloyed shell colloidal semiconductor quantum wells (CQWs) dispersed in toluene are employed in the cavity created inside a poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) microfluidic device using SiO2&#8208;protected Ag mirrors to achieve in&#8208;solution lasing. Lasing from such a microfluidic device having CQWs solution as a microfluidic gain medium is shown for the first time with a record&#8208;low optical gain threshold of 17.1 &#181;J cm&#8722;&#178; and lasing threshold of 68.4 &#181;J cm&#8722;&#178; among all solution&#8208;based lasing demonstrations. In addition, air&#8208;stable SiO2 protected Ag films are used and designed to form highly tunable and reflective mirrors required to attain a high&#8208;quality Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot cavity. These realized record&#8208;low thresholds emanate from the high&#8208;quality on&#8208;chip cavity together with the core/crown@gradient&#8208;alloyed shell CQWs having giant gain cross&#8208;section and slow Auger rates. This microfabricated CQW laser provides a compact and inexpensive coherent light source for microfluidics and integrated optics covering the visible spectral region.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Responsive Antibiotic&#8208;Loaded Nanoparticle Specifically Binds Pathogens and Overcomes Antimicrobial&#8208;Resistant Infections</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dextran&#8208;coated polymeric nanoparticle is developed to target and eliminate antimicrobial&#8208;resistant pathogens. The NP can bind to lectins expressed by bacteria and accumulate in the infected tissues, releasing the antimicrobial in response to the inflammatory microenvironment, and overcoming antimicrobial resistance. The NP can eliminate biofilm and intracellular infections, and exhibits remarkable in vivo efficacy in treating antimicrobial&#8208;resistant infections.








Abstract
Antimicrobial resistant (AMR) infections are a growing threat to public health and there is a general lack of development in new antibiotics. Here, a dextran&#8208;coated stimuli&#8208;responsive nanoparticle (NP) that encapsulates the hydrophobic antibiotic, rifampicin, and specifically binds bacteria to overcome AMR infections is reported. The NP shows a strong affinity with a variety of pathogens in vitro and effectively accumulates in the bacterial infected tissues. The NP is activated by either low pH or high reactive oxygen species in the infectious microenvironment, and releases both cationic polymer and rifampicin that display synergistic activity against AMR pathogens. The NP carrier also enables the antibiotic to penetrate both bacterial biofilms and mammalian cells, thus allowing the elimination of biofilm and intracellular infections. The NP formulation demonstrates both safety and efficacy in two animal infection models against either Gram&#8208;negative or Gram&#8208;positive AMR pathogens.

         <title>Biomimetic Design of Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Hybrid Nanozymes as Superoxide Scavengers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The key factor for de novo design of a metalloenzyme mimetic includes a suitable protein scaffold and enzyme active centers. A biomimetic cascade nanozyme is artificially created based on the hybridization of a recombinant ferritin&#8208;heavy&#8208;chain&#8208;based protein scaffold modified for mitochondria&#8208;targeting and a Mn&#8208;based nanoparticle as the core of enzymatic activity.








Abstract
Development of enzyme mimics for the scavenging of excessive mitochondrial superoxide (O2&#8226;&#8722;) can serve as an effective strategy in the treatment of many diseases. Here, protein reconstruction technology and nanotechnology is taken advantage of to biomimetically create an artificial hybrid nanozyme. These nanozymes consist of ferritin&#8208;heavy&#8208;chain&#8208;based protein as the enzyme scaffold and a metal nanoparticle core as the enzyme active center. This artificial cascade nanozyme possesses superoxide dismutase&#8208; and catalase&#8208;like activities and also targets mitochondria by overcoming multiple biological barriers. Using cardiac ischemia&#8208;reperfusion animal models, the protective advantages of the hybrid nanozymes are demonstrated in vivo during mitochondrial oxidative injury and in the recovery of heart functionality following infarction via systemic delivery and localized release from adhesive hydrogels (i.e., cardiac patch), respectively. This study illustrates a de novo design strategy in the development of enzyme mimics and provides a promising therapeutic option for alleviating oxidative damage in regenerative medicine.

         <title>Hybrid 0D Antimony Halides as Air&#8208;Stable Luminophores for High&#8208;Spatial&#8208;Resolution Remote Thermography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Luminescent organic&#8211;inorganic low&#8208;dimensional ns2 metal halides are increasingly explored as thermal phosphors for high&#8208;resolution remote thermography and thermometry due to the high thermal sensitivity of their radiative lifetime. Thin films of such hybrids, conformally coating the surface of interest, can map the temperature with a spatial precision as high as 1 &#956;m using fluorescence&#8208;lifetime imaging.








Abstract
Luminescent organic&#8211;inorganic low&#8208;dimensional ns2 metal halides are of rising interest as thermographic phosphors. The intrinsic nature of the excitonic self&#8208;trapping provides for reliable temperature sensing due to the existence of a temperature range, typically 50&#8211;100 K wide, in which the luminescence lifetimes (and quantum yields) are steeply temperature&#8208;dependent. This sensitivity range can be adjusted from cryogenic temperatures to above room temperature by structural engineering, thus enabling diverse thermometric and thermographic applications ranging from protein crystallography to diagnostics in microelectronics. Owing to the stable oxidation state of Sb3+, Sb(III)&#8208;based halides are far more attractive than all major non&#8208;heavy&#8208;metal alternatives (Sn&#8208;, Ge&#8208;, Bi&#8208;based halides). In this work, the relationship between the luminescence characteristics and crystal structure and microstructure of TPP2SbBr5 (TPP = tetraphenylphosphonium) is established, and then its potential is showcased as environmentally stable and robust phosphor for remote thermography. The material is easily processable into thin films, which is highly beneficial for high&#8208;spatial&#8208;resolution remote thermography. In particular, a compelling combination of high spatial resolution (1&#160;&#181;m) and high thermometric precision (high specific sensitivities of 0.03&#8211;0.04 K&#8722;1) is demonstrated by fluorescence&#8208;lifetime imaging of a heated resistive pattern on a flat substrate, covered with a solution&#8208;spun film of TPP2SbBr5.

         <title>Multiscale Assembly of [AgS4] Tetrahedrons into Hierarchical Ag&#8211;S Networks for Robust Photonic Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Infinite 2D Ag&#8211;S network&#8208;based hierarchical structures are constructed through the multiscale assembly of the [AgS4] tetrahedron unit, spanning from atomic&#8208;, molecular&#8208;, nanometer&#8208;, to micrometer&#8208;scale. The resulting ensembles show the function of a 1D photonic reflector in water, and have a robust and customizable structural color.








Abstract
There is an urgent need to assemble ultrasmall metal chalcogenides (with atomic precision) into functional materials with the required anisotropy and uniformity, on a micro&#8208; or even macroscale. Here, a delicate yet simple chemistry is developed to produce a silver&#8211;sulfur network microplate with a high monodispersity in size and morphology. Spanning from the atomic, molecular, to nanometer, to micrometer scale, the key structural evolution of the obtained microplates includes 2D confinement growth, edge&#8208;sharing growth mode, and thermodynamically driven layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer stacking, all of which are derived from the [AgS4] tetrahedron unit. The key to such a high hierarchical, complex, and accurate assembly is the dense deprotonated ligand layer on the surface of the microplates, forming an infinite surface with high negative charge density. This feature operates at an orderly distance to allow further hierarchical self&#8208;assembly on the microscale to generate columnar assemblies composed of microplate components, thereby endowing the feature of the 1D photonic reflector to water (i.e., photonic water). The reflective color of the resulting photonic water is highly dependent on the thickness of the building blocks (i.e., silver&#8211;sulfur microplates), and the coexistent order and fluidity help to form robust photonic water.

         <title>Ultrathin and Conformable Lead Halide Perovskite Photodetector Arrays for Potential Application in Retina&#8208;Like Vision Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin lead halide perovskite photodetector arrays with a thickness of 2.4&#160;&#181;m are fabricated based on patterned all&#8208;inorganic CsPbBr3 films. The device with excellent flexibility and conformal contact characteristics shows robust mechanical stability under bending or compressive strain. More importantly, it conforms to hemispherical support realizing imaging of light distribution, indicating the potential applications in retina&#8208;like vision sensing.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed lead halide perovskites are considered one of the promising materials for flexible optoelectronics. However, the array integration of ultrathin flexible perovskite photodetectors (PDs) remains a significant challenge limited by the incompatibility of perovskite materials with manufacturing techniques involving polar liquids. Here, an ultrathin (2.4&#160;&#181;m) and conformable perovskite&#8208;based PD array (10 &#215; 10 pixels) with ultralight weight (3.12&#160;g m&#8722;2) and excellent flexibility, is reported. Patterned all&#8208;inorganic CsPbBr3 perovskite films with precise pixel position, controllable morphology, and homogenous dimension, are synthesized by a vacuum&#8208;assisted drop&#8208;casting patterning process as the active layer. The use of waterproof parylene&#8208;C film as substrate and encapsulation layer effectively protects the perovskite films against penetration of polar liquids during the peeling&#8208;off process. Benefitting from the encapsulation and ultrathin property, the device exhibits long&#8208;term stability in the ambient environment, and robust mechanical stability under bending or 50% compressive strain. More importantly, the ultrathin flexible PD arrays conforming to hemispherical support realize imaging of light distribution, indicating the potential applications in retina&#8208;like vision sensing.

         <title>Bioinspired Spiky Peroxidase&#8208;Mimics for Localized Bacterial Capture and Synergistic Catalytic Sterilization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired, spiky, and highly catalytic&#8208;active virus&#8208;like peroxidase&#8208;mimic (V&#8208;POD&#8208;M) is synthesized for the localized &#8220;capture and killing&#8221; eradication of pathogenic bacteria. Experimental and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the V&#8208;POD&#8208;M exhibits strong bacterial interactions and efficient capture, synergistic catalytic sterilization, and similar in vivo disinfection efficiency to that of vancomycin, which provides a promising broad&#8208;spectrum therapy for nonantibiotic disinfection.








Abstract
Besides the pandemic caused by the coronavirus outbreak, many other pathogenic microbes also pose a devastating threat to human health, for instance, pathogenic bacteria. Due to the lack of broad&#8208;spectrum antibiotics, it is urgent to develop nonantibiotic strategies to fight bacteria. Herein, inspired by the localized &#8220;capture and killing&#8221; action of bacteriophages, a virus&#8208;like peroxidase&#8208;mimic (V&#8208;POD&#8208;M) is synthesized for efficient bacterial capture (mesoporous spiky structures) and synergistic catalytic sterilization (metal&#8211;organic&#8208;framework&#8208;derived catalytic core). Experimental and theoretical calculations show that the active compound, MoO3, can serve as a peroxo&#8208;complex&#8208;intermediate to reduce the free energy for catalyzing H2O2, which mainly benefits the generation of &#8226;OH radicals. The unique virus&#8208;like spikes endow the V&#8208;POD&#8208;M with fast bacterial capture and killing abilities (nearly 100% at 16 &#181;g mL&#8211;1). Furthermore, the in vivo experiments show that V&#8208;POD&#8208;M possesses similar disinfection treatment and wound skin recovery efficiencies to vancomycin. It is suggested that this inexpensive, durable, and highly reactive oxygen species (ROS) catalytic active V&#8208;POD&#8208;M provides a promising broad&#8208;spectrum therapy for nonantibiotic disinfection.

&lt;p&gt;A bioinspired, spiky, and highly catalytic&#8208;active virus&#8208;like peroxidase&#8208;mimic (V&#8208;POD&#8208;M) is synthesized for the localized &#8220;capture and killing&#8221; eradication of pathogenic bacteria. Experimental and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the V&#8208;POD&#8208;M exhibits strong bacterial interactions and efficient capture, synergistic catalytic sterilization, and similar in vivo disinfection efficiency to that of vancomycin, which provides a promising broad&#8208;spectrum therapy for nonantibiotic disinfection.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides the pandemic caused by the coronavirus outbreak, many other pathogenic microbes also pose a devastating threat to human health, for instance, pathogenic bacteria. Due to the lack of broad&#8208;spectrum antibiotics, it is urgent to develop nonantibiotic strategies to fight bacteria. Herein, inspired by the localized &#8220;capture and killing&#8221; action of bacteriophages, a virus&#8208;like peroxidase&#8208;mimic (V&#8208;POD&#8208;M) is synthesized for efficient bacterial capture (mesoporous spiky structures) and synergistic catalytic sterilization (metal&#8211;organic&#8208;framework&#8208;derived catalytic core). Experimental and theoretical calculations show that the active compound, MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, can serve as a peroxo&#8208;complex&#8208;intermediate to reduce the free energy for catalyzing H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which mainly benefits the generation of &#8226;OH radicals. The unique virus&#8208;like spikes endow the V&#8208;POD&#8208;M with fast bacterial capture and killing abilities (nearly 100% at 16 &#181;g mL&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt;). Furthermore, the in vivo experiments show that V&#8208;POD&#8208;M possesses similar disinfection treatment and wound skin recovery efficiencies to vancomycin. It is suggested that this inexpensive, durable, and highly reactive oxygen species (ROS) catalytic active V&#8208;POD&#8208;M provides a promising broad&#8208;spectrum therapy for nonantibiotic disinfection.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Triple&#8208;Cation and Mixed&#8208;Halide Perovskite Single Crystal for High&#8208;Performance X&#8208;ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Smaller cations and anions are incorporated into FAPbI3 single crystal to release its lattice stress and enhance its stability. The formed inch&#8208;sized triple&#8208;cation mixed&#8208;halide perovskite single crystals exhibit suppressed ion migration, long carrier diffusion length, large mobility, and excellent uniformity. These superior properties are utilized for the construction of a high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray detector array, realizing high&#8208;contrast X&#8208;ray imaging.








Abstract
Low ionic migration is required for a semiconductor material to realize stable high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray detection. In this work, successful controlled incorporation of not only methylammonium (MA+) and cesium (Cs+) cations, but also bromine (Br&#8211;) anions into the FAPbI3 lattice to grow inch&#8208;sized stable perovskite single crystal (FAMACs SC) is reported. The smaller cations and anions, comparing to the original FA+ and I&#8211; help release lattice stress so that the FAMACs SC shows lower ion migration, enhanced hardness, lower trap density, longer carrier lifetime and diffusion length, higher charge mobility and thermal stability, and better uniformity. Therefore, X&#8208;ray detectors made of the superior FAMACs SCs show the highest sensitivity of (3.5 &#177; 0.2) &#215; 106 &#956;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, about 29 times higher than the latest record of 1.22 &#215; 105 &#956;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 for polycrystalline MAPbI3 wafer under the same 40 keV X&#8208;ray radiation. Furthermore, the FAMACs SC X&#8208;ray detector shows a low detection limit of 42 nGy s&#8722;1, stable dark current, and photocurrent response. Finally, it is demonstrated that high contrast X&#8208;ray imaging is realized using the FAMACs SC detector. The effective triple&#8208;cation mixed halide strategy and the high crystalline quality make the present FAMACs SCs promising for next&#8208;generation X&#8208;ray imaging systems.

         <title>Formation of Novel Octuplex DNA Molecules from Guanine Quadruplexes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;driven formation of a novel type of DNA&#8208;based molecule, with the highest number of guanines per cross section, is reported. Atomic force microscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy, and CD spectroscopy of guanine octuplex (G8&#8208;) DNA reveal its organized, mechanically and thermodynamically stable, of high guanine content, coiled&#8208;coil structure&#8212;which make it a prospective candidate for molecular nanoelectronics.








Abstract
Guanine quadruplex (G4)&#8208;DNA structures have sparked the interest of many scientists due to their important biological roles and their potential use in molecular nanoelectronics and nanotechnology. The high guanine content in G4&#8208;DNA endows it with mechanical stability, robustness, and improved charge transport properties&#8212;attractive attributes for a molecular nanowire. The self&#8208;driven formation of a novel G4&#8208;DNA&#8208;based nanostructure, coined guanine octuplex (G8)&#8208;DNA, is reported herein. Atomic force microscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy characterization of this molecule reveal its organized coiled&#8208;coil structure, which is found to be stable under different temperatures and surrounding conditions. G8&#8208;DNA exhibits enhanced stiffness, mechanical and thermodynamic stability when compared to its parent G4&#8208;DNA. These, along with its high guanine content, make G8&#8208;DNA a compelling new molecule, and a highly prospective candidate for molecular nanoelectronics.

         <title>Tuning the Selective Adsorption Site of Biomass on Co3O4 by Ir Single Atoms for Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single atoms of Ir are anchored on Co3O4 for efficient electro&#8208;oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). It is found that an isolated Ir atom can optimize the adsorption configuration of HMF molecules on catalysts and accelerate HMF oxidation.








Abstract
The electrosynthesis from 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is considered a green strategy to achieve biomass&#8208;derived high&#8208;value chemicals. As the molecular structure of HMF is relatively complicated, understanding the HMF adsorption/catalysis behavior on electrocatalysts is vital for biomass&#8208;based electrosynthesis. The electrocatalysis behavior can be modulated by tuning the adsorption energy of the reactive molecules. In this work, the HMF adsorption behavior on spinel oxide, Co3O4 is discovered. Correspondingly, the adsorption energy of HMF on Co3O4 is successfully tuned by decorating with single&#8208;atom Ir. It is observed that compared with bare Co3O4, single&#8208;atom&#8208;Ir&#8208;loaded Co3O4 (Ir&#8208;Co3O4) can enhance adsorption with the C&#63742;C groups of HMF. The synergetic adsorption can enhance the overall conversion of HMF on electrocatalysts. With the modulated HMF adsorption, the as&#8208;designed Ir&#8208;Co3O4 exhibits a record performance (with an onset potential of 1.15 VRHE) for the electrosynthesis from HMF.

         <title>Efficient Luminescent Halide Quadruple&#8208;Perovskite Nanocrystals via Trap&#8208;Engineering for Highly Sensitive Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lead&#8208;free quadruple&#8208;perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) with R3&#773;m space group symmetry are synthesized. The photoluminescence quantum yield can be enhanced by 96&#8208;fold via metal alloying. Photodetectors based on the quadruple&#8208;perovskite NCs exhibit high responsivity up to 0.98 &#215; 104 A W&#8722;1.








Abstract
The colloidal synthesis of a new type of lead&#8208;free halide quadruple&#8208;perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) is reported. The photoluminescence quantum yield and charge&#8208;carrier lifetime of quadruple&#8208;perovskite NCs can be enhanced by 96 and 77&#8208;fold, respectively, via metal alloying. Study of charge&#8208;carrier dynamics provide solid demonstrate that the PL enhancement is due to the elimination of ultrafast (1.4 ps) charge&#8208;carrier trapping processes in the alloyed NCs. Thanks to the high crystallinity, low trap&#8208;state density, and long carrier lifetime (193.4 &#956;s), the alloyed quadruple&#8208;perovskite NCs can serve as the active material for high&#8208;performance photodetectors, which exhibit high responsivity (up to 0.98 &#215; 104 A W&#8722;1) and an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 3 &#215; 106%. These numbers are among the highest for perovskite&#8208;NC&#8208;based photodetectors.

         <title>From Understanding Mechanical Behavior to Curvature Prediction of Humidity&#8208;Triggered Bilayer Actuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in&#8208;depth mechanistic understanding of the mechanical properties of bilayer actuators based on the humidity&#8208;responsive polymer poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) in combination with volumetric strain measurements allows for the curvature prediction of humidity&#8208;triggered bilayer actuators by an analytic composite beam model.








Abstract
Nature will always be an endless source of bioinspiration for man&#8208;made smart materials and multifunctional devices. Impressively, even cutoff leaves from resurrection plants can autonomously and reproducibly change their shape upon humidity changes, which goes along with total recovery of their mechanical properties after being completely dried. In this work, simple bilayers are presented as autonomously moving, humidity&#8208;triggered bending actuators. The bilayers&#8212;showing reproducible bending behavior with reversible kinematics and multiway behavior&#8212;are studied in terms of their mechanical behavior upon humidity changes. The active layer consists of a highly conducting polymer film based on poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) with poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) as passive layer. The response to humidity is explored with dynamic mechanical thermal analysis and quartz crystal microbalance measurements. Introduction of a composite beam model allows to predict the curvature of the actuators with input from the rheological measurements. It is clearly demonstrated that volumetric strain and Young's modulus, both heavily influenced by the water uptake, dominate the bending behavior and therefore the curvature of the actuators. This loop of rheological characterization coupled with an analytical model allows to predict curvatures of in principle any complex geometry and material combination for moving parts in soft robotics.

         <title>Electrolyte&#8208;Mediated Stabilization of High&#8208;Capacity Micro&#8208;Sized Antimony Anodes for Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new electrolyte&#8208;engineering approach is presented to stabilize the micro&#8208;sized alloying anodes (e.g., Sb anode) in potassium&#8208;ion batteries. A high capacity of 628 mAh g&#8211;1 close to the capacity limit of potassium metal is achieved. An interfacial model related to the electronegativity and stability of the K+&#8208;solvent&#8208;anions is presented to predict and analyze the electrolyte stability and electrode performance.








Abstract
Alloying anodes exhibit very high capacity when used in potassium&#8208;ion batteries, but their severe capacity fading hinders their practical applications. The failure mechanism has traditionally been attributed to the large volumetric change and/or their fragile solid electrolyte interphase. Herein, it is reported that an antimony (Sb) alloying anode, even in bulk form, can be stabilized readily by electrolyte engineering. The Sb anode delivers an extremely high capacity of 628 and 305 mAh g&#8211;1 at current densities of 100 and 3000&#160;mA g&#8211;1, respectively, and remains stable for more than 200 cycles. Interestingly, there is no need to do nanostructural engineering and/or carbon modification to achieve this excellent performance. It is shown that the change in K+ solvation structure, which is tuned by electrolyte composition (i.e., anion, solvent, and concentration), is the main reason for achieving this excellent performance. Moreover, an interfacial model based on the K+&#8208;solvent&#8208;anion complex behavior is presented. The electronegativity of the K+&#8208;solvent&#8208;anion complex, which can be tuned by changing the solvent type and anion species, is used to predict and control electrode stability. The results shed new light on the failure mechanism of alloying anodes, and provide a new guideline for electrolyte design that stabilizes metal&#8208;ion batteries using alloying anodes.

         <title>An Air&#8208;Stable and Li&#8208;Metal&#8208;Compatible Glass&#8208;Ceramic Electrolyte enabling High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Li Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new glass&#8208;ceramic Li3.2P0.8Sn0.2S4 solid&#8208;state electrolyte is developed to simultaneously possess high ionic conductivity (10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 level at room temperature), excellent air&#8208;stability (dry room operable), and good Li metal compatibility. This finding is highly expected that can accelerate the commercialization of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries.








Abstract
The development of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries (ASSLMBs) has attracted significant attention due to their potential to maximize energy density and improved safety compared to the conventional liquid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;based Li&#8208;ion batteries. However, it is very challenging to fabricate an ideal solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) that simultaneously possesses high ionic conductivity, excellent air&#8208;stability, and good Li metal compatibility. Herein, a new glass&#8208;ceramic Li3.2P0.8Sn0.2S4 (gc&#8208;Li3.2P0.8Sn0.2S4) SSE is synthesized to satisfy the aforementioned requirements, enabling high&#8208;performance ASSLMBs at room temperature (RT). Compared with the conventional Li3PS4 glass&#8208;ceramics, the present gc&#8208;Li3.2P0.8Sn0.2S4 SSE with 12% amorphous content has an enlarged unit cell and a high Li+ ion concentration, which leads to 6.2&#8208;times higher ionic conductivity (1.21 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 at RT) after a simple cold sintering process. The (P/Sn)S4 tetrahedron inside the gc&#8208;Li3.2P0.8Sn0.2S4 SSE is verified to show a strong resistance toward reaction with H2O in 5%&#8208;humidity air, demonstrating excellent air&#8208;stability. Moreover, the gc&#8208;Li3.2P0.8Sn0.2S4 SSE triggers the formation of Li&#8211;Sn alloys at the Li/SSE interface, serving as an essential component to stabilize the interface and deliver good electrochemical performance in both symmetric and full cells. The discovery of this gc&#8208;Li3.2P0.8Sn0.2S4 superionic conductor enriches the choice of advanced SSEs and accelerates the commercialization of ASSLMBs.

         <title>Great Location: About Effects of Surface Bound Neighboring Groups for Passive and Active Fine&#8208;Tuning of CO2 Adsorption Properties in Model Carbon Capture Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Changing the molecular environment in direct vicinity to the active amine group opens up vast possibilities to fine&#8208;tune CO2 adsorption. Through the introduction of various neighboring groups (NGs), key metrics such as the heat of adsorption and selectivity can be tuned. The investigation of such NG interaction is enabled by a new, highly flexible model system based on click chemistry.








Abstract
Improved carbon capture materials are crucial for managing the CO2 level in the atmosphere. The past focus was on increasing adsorption capacities. It is widely known that controlling the heat of adsorption (&#916;Hads) is equally important. If it is too low, CO2 uptake takes place at unfavorable conditions and with insufficient selectivity. If it is too high, chemisorption occurs, and the materials can hardly be regenerated. The conventional approach for influencing &#916;Hads is the modification of the adsorbing center. This paper proposes an alternative strategy. The hypothesis is that fine&#8208;tuning of the molecular environment around the adsorbing center is a powerful tool for the adjustment of CO2&#8208;binding properties. Via click chemistry, any desired neighboring group (NG) can be incorporated on the surfaces of the nanoporous organosilica model materials. Passive NGs induce a change in the polarity of the surface, whereas active NGs are capable of direct interaction with the active center/CO2 pair. The effects on &#916;Hads and on the selectivity are studied. A situation can be realized which resembles frustrated Lewis acid&#8211;base pairs, and the investigation of the binding&#8208;species by solid&#8208;state NMR indicates that the push&#8211;pull effects could play an essential role not only in CO2 adsorption but also in its activation.

         <title>Ultrasmall, Bright, and Photostable Fluorescent Core&#8211;Shell Aluminosilicate Nanoparticles for Live&#8208;Cell Optical Super&#8208;Resolution Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fourfold coordinated aluminum within ultrasmall aluminosilicate nanoparticles leads to redox&#8208;type blinking of encapsulated organic fluorophores under live&#8208;cell imaging conditions. Their blinking, brightness, and photostability characteristics make these excellent probes for optical super&#8208;resolution microscopy. These nontoxic nanoparticles can be used to interrogate both fixed and live&#8208;cell systems as well as to quantitatively study the processing of nanoparticles within live cells.








Abstract
Stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) is an optical super&#8208;resolution microscopy (SRM) technique that traditionally requires toxic and non&#8208;physiological imaging buffers and setups that are not conducive to live&#8208;cell studies. It is observed that ultrasmall (&lt;10&#160;nm) fluorescent core&#8211;shell aluminosilicate nanoparticles (aC&#8217; dots) covalently encapsulating organic fluorophores enable STORM with a single excitation source and in a regular (non&#8208;toxic) imaging buffer. It is shown that fourfold coordinated aluminum is responsible for dye blinking, likely via photoinduced redox processes. It is demonstrated that this phenomenon is observed across different dye families leading to probes brighter and more photostable than the parent free dyes. Functionalization of aC&#8217; dots with antibodies allows targeted fixed cell STORM imaging. Finally, aC&#8217; dots enable live&#8208;cell STORM imaging providing quantitative measures of the size of intracellular vesicles and the number of particles per vesicle. The results suggest the emergence of a powerful ultrasmall, bright, and photostable optical SRM particle platform with characteristics relevant to clinical translation for the quantitative assessment of cellular structures and processes from live&#8208;cell imaging.

         <title>Fused Aromatic Network with Exceptionally High Carrier Mobility</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystalline fused aromatic network with a basal plane stoichiometry of C5N exhibits exceptionally high carrier mobility. The thin flakes of C5N, obtained by polydimethylsiloxane stamping, show ambipolar charge transport and remarkably high electron and hole mobilities, demonstrating their huge potential for applications in thin film electronics.








Abstract
Recently, studies of 2D organic layered materials with unique electronic properties have generated considerable interest in the research community. However, the development of organic materials with functional electrical transport properties is still needed. Here, a 2D fused aromatic network (FAN) structure with a C5N basal plane stoichiometry is designed and synthesized, and thin films are cast from C5N solution onto silicon dioxide substrates. Then field&#8208;effect transistors are fabricated using C5N thin flakes as the active layer in a bottom&#8208;gate top&#8208;contact configuration to characterize their electrical properties. The C5N thin flakes, isolated by polydimethylsiloxane stamping, exhibit ambipolar charge transport and extraordinarily high electron (996 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) and hole (501 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) mobilities, surpassing the performance of most pristine organic materials without doping. These results demonstrate their vast potential for applications in thin&#8208;film optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Synthetic Kramers Pair in Phononic Elastic Plates and Helical Edge States on a Dislocation Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The topological origin of the &#8220;zone&#8208;folding&#8221; phononic topological insulator is revealed and its interpretation as an analog to the quantum spin Hall effect is shown to present key differences in comparison with its electronic counterpart. Also, the possibility of realizing two counter&#8208;propagating gapless helical edge states on a dislocation interface connecting two subdomains with bulk pattern identical up to a relative translation is shown.








Abstract
In conventional theories, topological band properties are intrinsic characteristics of the bulk material and do not depend on the choice of the reference frame. In this scenario, the principle of bulk&#8208;edge correspondence can be used to predict the existence of edge states between topologically distinct materials. In this study, a 2D elastic phononic plate is proposed with a Kekul&#233;&#8208;distorted honeycomb pattern engraved on it. It is found that the pseudospin and the pseudospin&#8208;dependent Chern numbers are not invariant properties, and the &#8484;2 number is no longer a sufficient indicator to examine the existence of the edge state. The distinctive pseudospin texture and the pseudomagnetic field are also revealed. Finally, the synthetic helical edge states are successfully devised and experimentally implemented on a dislocation interface connecting two subdomains with bulk pattern identical up to a relative translation. The edge state is also imaged via laser&#160;vibrometry.

         <title>Enhanced Redox Kinetics and Duration of Aqueous I2/I&#8722; Conversion Chemistry by MXene Confinement</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An MXene confinement strategy is proposed to boost the redox kinetics and cycle duration of an aqueous Zn&#8211;I2 battery via an electrodeposition method. The confinement effect and superior electron supply of the Nb2CTX MXene host results in an efficient I2/I&#8722; couple conversion and suppression of the undesired shuttle effect, resulting in excellent power density, energy density, and anti&#8208;self&#8208;discharge performance.








Abstract
Weak binding and affinity between the conductive support and iodine species leads to inadequate electron transfer and the shuttle effect. Herein, redox kinetics and duration are significantly boosted by introducing a Nb2CTX host that is classified as a layered 2D Nb&#8208;based MXene. With a facile electrodeposition strategy, initial I&#8722; ions are electrically driven to insert in the nanosized interlayers and are electro&#8208;oxidized in situ. Linear I2 is firmly confined inside and benefits from the rapid charge supply from the MXene. Consequently, an aqueous Zn battery based on a Zn metal anode and ZnSO4 electrolyte delivers an ultraflat plateau at 1.3&#160;V, which contributes to 84.5% of the capacity and 89.1% of the energy density. Record rate capability (143 mAh g&#8722;1 at 18 A g&#8722;1) and lifespan (23&#160;000) cycles are achieved, which are far superior to those of all reported aqueous MXenes and I2&#8211;metal batteries. Moreover, the low voltage decay rate of 5.6&#160;mV h&#8722;1 indicates its superior anti&#8208;self&#8208;discharge properties. Physicochemical analyses and density functional theory calculations elucidate that the localized electron transfer and trapping effect of the Nb2CTX MXene host are responsible for enhanced kinetics and suppressed shuttle behavior. This work can be extended to the fabrication of other I2&#8211;metal batteries with long&#8208;life&#8208;time expectations.

         <title>In Situ Lignin Modification toward Photonic Wood</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photonic wood with high lignin content is fabricated via an in situ, rapid, and scalable process that involves the photocatalytic oxidation of native lignin in wood by H2O2 and UV light. The resulting photonic wood features a unique hierarchical microstructure, high mechanical strength, excellent water stability, remarkable optical properties and designable patterning capability.








Abstract
Lignin serves as a binder that forms strong matrices of the cell walls of wood. However, it has many photolabile chromophore groups that create a monotonic brownish color and make wood susceptible to photodegradation. Herein, a new strategy is reported for modifying lignin using an in situ, rapid, and scalable process that involves the photocatalytic oxidation of native lignin in wood by H2O2 and UV light. The reaction selectively eliminates lignin's chromophores while leaving the aromatic skeleton intact, thus modulating the optical properties of wood. The resulting &#8220;photonic wood&#8221; retains &#8776;80% of its original lignin content, which continues to serve as a strong binder and water&#8208;proofing agent. As a result, photonic wood features a much higher mechanical strength in a wet environment (20&#8208;times higher tensile strength and 12&#8208;times greater compression resistance), significant scalability (&#8776;2 m long sample), and largely reduced processing times (1&#8211;6.5 h vs 4&#8211;14 h) compared with delignification methods. Additionally, this in situ lignin&#8208;modified wood structure is easily patterned through a photocatalytic oxidation process. This photocatalytic production of photonic wood paves the way for the large&#8208;scale manufacturing of sustainable biosourced functional materials for a range of applications, including energy&#8208;efficient buildings, optical management, and fluidic, ionic, electronic, and optical devices.

The resulting &#8220;photonic wood&#8221; retains &#8776;80% of its original lignin content, which continues to serve as a strong binder and water&#8208;proofing agent. As a result, photonic wood features a much higher mechanical strength in a wet environment (20&#8208;times higher tensile strength and 12&#8208;times greater compression resistance), significant scalability (&#8776;2 m long sample), and largely reduced processing times (1&#8211;6.5 h vs 4&#8211;14 h) compared with delignification methods. Additionally, this in situ lignin&#8208;modified wood structure is easily patterned through a photocatalytic oxidation process. This photocatalytic production of photonic wood paves the way for the large&#8208;scale manufacturing of sustainable biosourced functional materials for a range of applications, including energy&#8208;efficient buildings, optical management, and fluidic, ionic, electronic, and optical devices.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Electronic Conductive Inorganic Cathodes Promising High&#8208;Energy Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The excessive inactive carbon in organic electrode materials (OEMs) is substituted by electronic conductive inorganic cathode materials, which are endowed with high electronic conductivity to transport electrons, high ion&#8208;storage capacity to act as secondary active materials, as well as strong affinity to OEMs. The strategy simultaneously achieves high capacities, low porosity, lean electrolyte, and thus high energy densities.








Abstract
The electrochemical utilization of organic electrode materials (OEMs) is highly dependent on an excess amount of inactive carbon at the expense of low packing density and energy density. In this work, the challenges by substituting inactive carbon with electronic conductive inorganic cathode (ECIC) materials, which are endowed with high electronic conductivity to transport electrons for redox reactions of the whole electrodes, high ion&#8208;storage capacity to act as secondary active materials, and strong affinity with OEMs to inhibit their dissolution, are addressed. Combining representative ECICs (TiS2 and Mo6S8) with organic electrode materials (perylene&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) and hexaazatrinaphthalene (HATN)) simultaneously achieves high capacity, low porosity, lean electrolyte, and thus high energy density. High gravimetric and volumetric energy densities of 153&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and 200&#160;Wh L&#8722;1 are delivered with superior cycling stability in a 30 mA h&#8208;level Li/PTCDA&#8208;TiS2 pouch cell. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept of organic&#8211;ECIC electrodes is also successfully demonstrated in monovalent Na, divalent Mg, and trivalent Al batteries, indicating their feasibility and generalizability. With the discovery of more ECIC materials and OEMs, it is anticipated that the proposed organic&#8211;ECIC system can result in further improvements at cell level to compete with transition metal&#8208;based Li&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Activatable NIR&#8208;II Plasmonic Nanotheranostics for Efficient Photoacoustic Imaging and Photothermal Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 3, January 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An activatable NIR&#8208;II plasmonic theranostics system for accurate tumor diagnosis and effective treatment is reported. This gold nanochain structure breaks through the traditional molecular imaging window, shifting from the visible to the NIR&#8208;II region, owing to fusion between adjacent gold nanoparticles in the restricted local space triggered by the high H2O2 level in the tumor microenvironment.








Abstract
Precise manipulation of optical properties through the structure&#8208;evolution of plasmonic nanoparticles is of great interest in biomedical fields including bioimaging and phototherapy. However, previous success has been limited to fixed assembled structures or visible&#8211;NIR&#8208;I absorption. Here, an activatable NIR&#8208;II plasmonic theranostics system based on silica&#8208;encapsulated self&#8208;assembled gold nanochains (AuNCs@SiO2) for accurate tumor diagnosis and effective treatment is reported. This transformable chain structure breaks through the traditional molecular imaging window, whose absorption can be redshifted from the visible to the NIR&#8208;II region owing to the fusion between adjacent gold nanoparticles in the restricted local space of AuNCs@SiO2 triggered by the high H2O2 level in the tumor microenvironment (TME), leading to the generation of a new string&#8208;like structure with strong NIR&#8208;II absorption, which is further confirmed by finite&#8208;difference&#8208;time&#8208;domain (FDTD) simulation. With the TME&#8208;activated characteristics, AuNCs@SiO2 exhibits excellent properties for photoacoustic imaging and a high photothermal conversion efficiency of 82.2% at 1064&#160;nm leading to severe cell death and remarkable tumor growth inhibition in vivo. These prominent intelligent TME&#8208;responsive features of AuNCs@SiO2 may open up a new avenue to explore optical regulated nano&#8208;platform for intelligent, accurate, and noninvasive theranostics in NIR&#8208;II window.

         <title>Extracellular&#8208;Matrix&#8208;Reinforced Bioinks for 3D Bioprinting Human Tissue</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 3, January 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of microscale phase&#8208;separated hybrid bioinks is described by combining tissue specific extracellular matrix (ECM) with alginate. This novel rECM hybrid bioink is tissue specific, cytocompatible, biocompatible, and pro&#8208;angiogenic, and is used to bioprint human airways composed of multiple, regionally specified primary human lung cell types.








Abstract
Recent advances in 3D bioprinting allow for generating intricate structures with dimensions relevant for human tissue, but suitable bioinks for producing translationally relevant tissue with complex geometries remain unidentified. Here, a tissue&#8208;specific hybrid bioink is described, composed of a natural polymer, alginate, reinforced with extracellular matrix derived from decellularized tissue (rECM). rECM has rheological and gelation properties beneficial for 3D bioprinting while retaining biologically inductive properties supporting tissue maturation ex vivo and in vivo. These bioinks are shear thinning, resist cell sedimentation, improve viability of multiple cell types, and enhance mechanical stability in hydrogels derived from them. 3D printed constructs generated from rECM bioinks suppress the foreign body response, are pro&#8208;angiogenic and support recipient&#8208;derived de novo blood vessel formation across the entire graft thickness in a murine model of transplant immunosuppression. Their proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle for generating human tissue is demonstrated by 3D bioprinting human airways composed of regionally specified primary human airway epithelial progenitor and smooth muscle cells. Airway lumens remained patent with viable cells for one month in vitro with evidence of differentiation into mature epithelial cell types found in native human airways. rECM bioinks are a promising new approach for generating functional human tissue using 3D bioprinting.

         <title>Ultrathin Ga2O3 Glass: A Large&#8208;Scale Passivation and Protection Material for Monolayer WS2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 3, January 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D transition metal dichalcogenides have promising properties for future semiconductor technologies. Their integration into functional devices requires cost&#8208;efficient and large&#8208;scale passivation and protection against material deposition. This work introduces ultrathin Ga2O3 glass as a new, scalable capping material for monolayer WS2. It exhibits a novel passivation mechanism and offers extraordinary protection against deposition of dielectric materials, for example, for top&#8208;gating.








Abstract
Atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenide crystals (TMDCs) have extraordinary optical properties that make them attractive for future optoelectronic applications. Integration of TMDCs into practical all&#8208;dielectric heterostructures hinges on the ability to passivate and protect them against necessary fabrication steps on large scales. Despite its limited scalability, encapsulation of TMDCs in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) currently has no viable alternative for achieving high performance of the final device. Here, it is shown that the novel, ultrathin Ga2O3 glass is an ideal centimeter&#8208;scale coating material that enhances optical performance of the monolayers and protects them against further material deposition. In particular, Ga2O3 capping of monolayer WS2 outperforms commercial&#8208;grade hBN in both scalability and optical performance at room temperature. These properties make Ga2O3 highly suitable for large&#8208;scale passivation and protection of monolayer TMDCs in functional&#160;heterostructures.

         <title>Surface Termination of Solution&#8208;Processed CH3NH3PbI3 Perovskite Film Examined using Electron Spectroscopies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 3, January 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interface property of perovskite is governed by the surface termination. The combination of ultraviolet photoelectron and metastable&#8208;atom electron spectroscopies is demonstrated as a versatile technique to prove the surface termination. This method is applied to a solution&#8208;processed CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film to show that the surface is terminated with a layer consisting of CH3NH3 and I.








Abstract
The interfaces of a perovskite solar cell significantly influence the charge processes in the cell, which contributes to the device performance with direct implication for surface potential, electronic structure, and chemical reactivity. The properties of the interface are strongly affected by the surface termination. In this work, the combination of ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and metastable&#8208;atom electron spectroscopy is demonstrated, to examine the surface termination of a solution&#8208;processed CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film. The results show that the surface of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film is terminated with a layer consisting of CH3NH3 and I. The interface energy level alignment for both occupied and unoccupied levels between CH3NH3PbI3 and C60 is also examined using UPS and low&#8208;energy inverse photoelectron spectroscopy. It turns out that an ideal energy level alignment is established for the electron collection and hole block at the perovskite and C60 interface.

         <title>Biopolymer Immune Implants&#8217; Sequential Activation of Innate and Adaptive Immunity for Colorectal Cancer Postoperative Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 3, January 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study provides a biopolymer immune implant for colorectal cancer post&#8208;surgical management. The implant sequentially elicits innate, adaptive, and memory immune responses, and results in complete residual tumor clearance, inhibition of tumor recurrence and distal tumor, and resistance to tumor re&#8208;challenge. The results presented will encourage potential clinical translation of this optimized implant upon tumor resection.








Abstract
Surgical resection is the first&#8208;line therapy for colorectal cancer (CRC). However, for advanced CRC, the curative effect of surgical resection is limited due to either local recurrence or distal metastasis. Postoperative in situ immunotherapy, presents a promising option for preventing tumor recurrence and metastasis, owing to the fact that surgeons have unique opportunities and direct access to the surgical site. Herein, a designed biopolymer immune implant for CRC post&#8208;surgical therapy, characterized with tissue adhesion, sustained drug release, and sequential elicitation of innate immunity, adaptive immunity, and immune memory effects, is reported. With gradual release of the loaded resiquimod (R848) and anti&#8208;OX40 antibody (aOX40), the immune implant can eradicate residual tumors post&#8208;surgery (with no tumor recurrence in 150 days), inhibit the growth of distal tumors and elicit immune memory effects to resist tumor re&#8208;challenge. Immunological analysis reveal that the biopolymer immune plant treatment leads to a two&#8208;stage action, with enhanced natural killer cells (NK cells) infiltration and activation of dendritic cells (DCs) in the first several days, then a greatly increased population of infiltrating T cells, and finally immune memory effects are established. The reported biopolymer immune implants provide a valuable and clinically&#8208;relevant option for post&#8208;surgical CRC management.

         <title>Revealing the Degradation and Self&#8208;Healing Mechanisms in Perovskite Solar Cells by Sub&#8208;Bandgap External Quantum Efficiency Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 3, January 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly sensitive sub&#8208;bandgap external quantum efficiency (s&#8208;EQE) spectroscopy for in situ monitoring of the ion dissociation process is developed to reveal the mechanism of intrinsic perovskite material degradation.








Abstract
Ion dissociation has been identified to determine the intrinsic stability of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs), but the underlying degradation mechanism is still elusive. Herein, by combining highly sensitive sub&#8208;bandgap external quantum efficiency (s&#8208;EQE) spectroscopy, impedance analysis, and theoretical calculations, the evolution of defect states in PVSCs during the degradation can be monitored. It is found that the degradation of PVSCs can be divided into three steps: 1) dissociation of ions from perovskite lattices, 2) migration of dissociated ions, and 3) consumption of I&#8722; by reacting with metal electrode. Importantly, step (3) is found to be crucial as it will accelerate the first two steps and lead to continuous degradation. By replacing the metal with more chemically robust indium tin oxide (ITO), it is found that the dissociated ions under light soaking will only saturate at the perovskite/ITO interface. Importantly, the dissociated ions will subsequently restore to the corresponding vacancies under dark condition to heal the perovskite and photovoltaic performance. Such shuttling of mobile ions without consumption in the ITO&#8208;contact PVSCs results in harvesting&#8211;rest&#8211;recovery cycles in natural day/night operation. It is envisioned that the mechanism of the intrinsic perovskite material degradation reported here will lead to clearer research directions toward highly stable PVSCs.

         <dc:description>
Cascade enzyme&#8208;based drug delivery bioreactors, GOx/hemin@ZIF&#8208;8@DHA (GHZD NCs), are fabricated with augmented biocatalytic efficiency. Free radicals and self&#8208;sufficient H2O2 in the tumor microenvironment trigger irretrievable apoptosis and necrosis, which burst severe damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) for activation of sequential immune responses. Moreover, GHZD NCs induce synergetic therapy with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 eliciting strong immunoreactions for inhibition of cancer metastasis.








Abstract
Biocatalytic nanomaterials have been verified to modulate the immunosuppressive state of an extensive range of solid tumors and directly induce antitumor immune response, which effectively combats the holdbacks in cancer immunotherapy. Herein, biomimetic cascade enzyme&#8208;initiated toxic&#8208;radical&#8208;generating devices (GHZD NCs) are fabricated by enveloping glucose oxidase (GOx), artificial nanozyme hemin, and sesquiterpene lactone endoperoxide derived dihydroartemisinin (DHA) into zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF&#8208;8) for enhanced biocatalytic immunotherapy. The GHZD NCs exhibit amplified multienzyme&#8208;mimic (glucose oxidase, peroxidase, and glutathione peroxidase) cascade reactions in artificial nanoscale proximity. Concurrently, a glutathione (GSH)&#8208;stimulated labile iron&#8208;current amplifier boosts C&#8208;centered free radicals, which endows the GHZD NCs with tumor&#8208;specific and self&#8208;circulating generation ability of vicious C&#8208;centered free radicals. Irreversible free radicals (&#183;C and &#183;OH) and sustainable H2O2 from sequential catalytic processes logically and selectively elevate the oxidative stress in the tumor, which further triggers an efficient immunogenic cell death (ICD) progress. In addition, the in situ nanozyme&#8208;based immunotherapy employed for tumor suppression successfully elicits the long&#8208;lasting immunological memory effect, which hinders the growth of distant tumors and lung metastasis.

         <title>Polarization&#8208;Modulated Multidirectional Photothermal Actuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 3, January 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic&#8211;plasmonic hybrid Fe3O4/Ag nanorods are used as building blocks to create a freestanding, multidirectional photothermal robot. The hybrid nanorods are magnetically aligned with perfect orientational order in specific robot domains to enable on&#8208;demand locomotion by modulating the polarization and on&#8211;off switching of a laser beam.








Abstract
Photothermal actuators have attracted increasing attention due to their ability to convert light energy into mechanical deformation and locomotion. This work reports a freestanding, multidirectional photothermal robot that can walk along a predesigned pathway by modulating laser polarization and on&#8211;off switching. Magnetic&#8211;plasmonic hybrid Fe3O4/Ag nanorods are synthesized using an unconventional templating approach. The coupled magnetic and plasmonic anisotropy allows control of the rod orientation, plasmonic excitation, and photothermal conversion by simply applying a magnetic field. Once the rods are fixed with desirable orientations in a bimorph actuator by magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;assisted lithography, the bending of the actuator can be controlled by switching the laser polarization. A bipedal robot is created by coupling the rod orientation with the alternating actuation of its two legs. Irradiating the robot by a laser with alternating or fixed polarization synergistically results in basic movement (backward and forward) and turning (including left&#8208;, right&#8208;, and U&#8208;turn), respectively. A complex walk along predesigned pathways can be potentially programmed by combining the movement and turning modes of the robots.

&lt;p&gt;Magnetic&#8211;plasmonic hybrid Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/Ag nanorods are used as building blocks to create a freestanding, multidirectional photothermal robot. The hybrid nanorods are magnetically aligned with perfect orientational order in specific robot domains to enable on&#8208;demand locomotion by modulating the polarization and on&#8211;off switching of a laser beam.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photothermal actuators have attracted increasing attention due to their ability to convert light energy into mechanical deformation and locomotion. This work reports a freestanding, multidirectional photothermal robot that can walk along a predesigned pathway by modulating laser polarization and on&#8211;off switching. Magnetic&#8211;plasmonic hybrid Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/Ag nanorods are synthesized using an unconventional templating approach. The coupled magnetic and plasmonic anisotropy allows control of the rod orientation, plasmonic excitation, and photothermal conversion by simply applying a magnetic field. Once the rods are fixed with desirable orientations in a bimorph actuator by magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;assisted lithography, the bending of the actuator can be controlled by switching the laser polarization. A bipedal robot is created by coupling the rod orientation with the alternating actuation of its two legs. Irradiating the robot by a laser with alternating or fixed polarization synergistically results in basic movement (backward and forward) and turning (including left&#8208;, right&#8208;, and U&#8208;turn), respectively. A complex walk along predesigned pathways can be potentially programmed by combining the movement and turning modes of the robots. This strategy provides an alternative driving mechanism for preparing functional soft robots, thus breaking through the limitations in the existing systems in terms of light sources and actuation manners.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Extremely Stable Luminescent Crosslinked Perovskite Nanoparticles under Harsh Environments over 1.5 Years</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 3, January 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An extraordinarily long stability, exceeding 1.5 years, for crosslinked perovskite nanoparticles (NPs) under harsh environments, by a novel materials design strategy, is reported. Surprisingly, the photoluminescence of the perovskite NPs is significantly increased under air, moisture, and chemicals, overcoming their instability in oxygen, water, and polar chemicals.








Abstract
Organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite nanoparticles (NPs) are a very strong candidate emitter that can meet the high luminescence efficiency and high color standard of Rec.2020. However, the instability of perovskite NPs is the most critical unsolved problem that limits their practical application. Here, an extremely stable crosslinked perovskite NP (CPN) is reported that maintains high photoluminescence quantum yield for 1.5 years (&gt;600 d) in air and in harsher liquid environments (e.g., in water, acid, or base solutions, and in various polar solvents), and for more than 100 d under 85&#160;&#176;C and 85% relative humidity without additional encapsulation. Unsaturated hydrocarbons in both the acid and base ligands of NPs are chemically crosslinked with a methacrylate&#8208;functionalized matrix, which prevents decomposition of the perovskite crystals. Counterintuitively, water vapor permeating through the crosslinked matrix chemically passivates surface defects in the NPs and reduces nonradiative recombination. Green&#8208;emitting and white&#8208;emitting flexible large&#8208;area displays are demonstrated, which are stable for &gt;400 d in air and in water. The high stability of the CPN in water enables biocompatible cell proliferation which is usually impossible when toxic Pb elements are present. The stable materials design strategies provide a breakthrough toward commercialization of perovskite NPs in displays and bio&#8208;related applications.

         <title>Continuous High&#8208;Throughput Fabrication of Architected Micromaterials via In&#8208;Air Photopolymerization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 3, January 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In&#8208;air polymerization of a liquid jet is presented as a novel platform to produce tunable micromaterials at flow rates &gt;1 mL min&#8208;1 per nozzle. A library of microparticles with tunable size, shape, morphology, and chemistry is presented. Stimuli&#8208;responsive Janus fiber with tunable composition and printed microlens arrays with controllable three&#8208;dimensional curvatures are demonstrated.








Abstract
Recent advances in optical coding, drug delivery, diagnostics, tissue engineering, shear&#8208;induced gelation, and functionally engineered rheology crucially depend on microparticles and microfibers with tunable shape, size, and composition. However, scalable manufacturing of the required complex micromaterials remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Here in&#8208;air polymerization of liquid jets is demonstrated as a novel platform to produce microparticles and microfibers with tunable size, shape, and composition at high throughput (&gt;100&#160;mL h&#8722;1 per nozzle). The polymerization kinetics is quantitatively investigated and modeled as a function of the ink composition, the UV light intensity, and the velocity of the liquid jet, enabling engineering of complex micromaterials in jetting regimes. The size, morphology, and local chemistry of micromaterials are independently controlled, as highlighted by producing micromaterials using 5 different photopolymers as well as multi&#8208;material composites. Simultaneous optimization of these control parameters yields rapid fabrication of stimuli&#8208;responsive Janus fibers that function as soft actuators. Finally, in&#8208;air photopolymerization enables control over the curvature of printed droplets, as highlighted by high&#8208;throughput printing of microlenses with tunable focal distance. The combination of rapid processing and tunability in composition and architecture opens a new route toward applications of tailored micromaterials in soft matter, medicine, pharmacy, and optics.

         <title>Cathodoluminescence of Ultrathin Twisted Ge1&#8211;xSnxS van der Waals Nanoribbon Waveguides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 3, January 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin twisted Ge1&#8211;xSnxS nanoribbons, realized via scalable vapor&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid growth over gold catalysts, provide a unique platform for probing guided excitonic waveguide modes in van der Waals semiconductors. Nanophotonic experiments using local electron&#8208;beam excitation detect the confined modes in the plane of the layered crystal and enable the measurement of key properties such as the field distribution into the adjacent cladding layers.








Abstract
Ultrathin van der Waals semiconductors have shown extraordinary optoelectronic and photonic properties. Propagating photonic modes make layered crystal waveguides attractive for photonic circuitry and for studying hybrid light&#8211;matter states. Accessing guided modes by conventional optics is challenging due to the limited spatial resolution and poor out&#8208;of&#8208;plane far&#8208;field coupling. Scanning near&#8208;field optical microscopy can overcome these issues and can characterize waveguide modes down to a resolution of tens of nanometers, albeit for planar samples or nanostructures with moderate height variations. Electron microscopy provides atomic&#8208;scale localization also for more complex geometries, and recent advances have extended the accessible excitations from interband transitions to phonons. Here, bottom&#8208;up synthesized layered semiconductor (Ge1&#8211;xSnxS) nanoribbons with an axial twist and deep subwavelength thickness are demonstrated as a platform for realizing waveguide modes, and cathodoluminescence spectroscopy is introduced as a tool to characterize them. Combined experiments and simulations show the excitation of guided modes by the electron beam and their efficient detection via photons emitted in the ribbon plane, which enables the measurement of key properties such as the evanescent field into the vacuum cladding with nanometer resolution. The results identify van der Waals waveguides operating in the infrared and highlight an electron&#8208;microscopy&#8208;based approach for probing complex&#8208;shaped nanophotonic structures.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Poly(vinylidene difluoride)/Dopamine Core/Shell Piezoelectric Nanofiber and Its Application for Biomedical Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 3, January 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance poly(vinylidene difluoride)/dopamine core/shell piezoelectric nanofibers with excellent stability are successfully fabricated by one&#8208;step electrospinning in large scale and quantity, offering an extraordinary building block for developing self&#8208;powered sensor devices to detect weak absolute pressure change from soft tissues in vivo. This sensing capability offers great diagnostic potential for the early assessment and prevention of cardiovascular diseases and respiratory disorders.








Abstract
Fabrication of soft piezoelectric nanomaterials is essential for the development of wearable and implantable biomedical devices. However, a big challenge in this soft functional material development is to achieve a high piezoelectric property with long&#8208;term stability in a biological environment. Here, a one&#8208;step strategy for fabricating core/shell poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF)/dopamine (DA) nanofibers (NFs) with a very high &#946;&#8208;phase content and self&#8208;aligned polarization is reported. The self&#8208;assembled core/shell structure is believed essential for the formation and alignment of &#946;&#8208;phase PVDF, where strong intermolecular interaction between the &#63743;NH2 groups on DA and the &#63743;CF2 groups on PVDF is responsible for aligning the PVDF chains and promoting &#946;&#8208;phase nucleation. The as&#8208;received PVDF/DA NFs exhibit significantly enhanced piezoelectric performance and excellent stability and biocompatibility. An all&#8208;fiber&#8208;based soft sensor is fabricated and tested on human skin and in vivo in mice. The devices show a high sensitivity and accuracy for detecting weak physiological mechanical stimulation from diaphragm motions and blood pulsation. This sensing capability offers great diagnostic potential for the early assessment and prevention of cardiovascular diseases and respiratory disorders.

The self&#8208;assembled core/shell structure is believed essential for the formation and alignment of &#946;&#8208;phase PVDF, where strong intermolecular interaction between the &lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; groups on DA and the &lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;CF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; groups on PVDF is responsible for aligning the PVDF chains and promoting &#946;&#8208;phase nucleation. The as&#8208;received PVDF/DA NFs exhibit significantly enhanced piezoelectric performance and excellent stability and biocompatibility. An all&#8208;fiber&#8208;based soft sensor is fabricated and tested on human skin and in vivo in mice. The devices show a high sensitivity and accuracy for detecting weak physiological mechanical stimulation from diaphragm motions and blood pulsation. This sensing capability offers great diagnostic potential for the early assessment and prevention of cardiovascular diseases and respiratory disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Voluntary&#8208;Opsonization&#8208;Enabled Precision Nanomedicines for Inflammation Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 3, January 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecularly engineered liposomes are shown to &#8220;hitch&#8208;hike&#8221; neutrophils through complementary &#8220;voluntary opsonization&#8221;. The chemotaxis of neutrophils overcomes the physiological barriers and dramatically enhances the accumulation of nanomedicines in the inflamed lungs for effective inflammation treatment. This strategy opens up new paths for neutrophil&#8208;enabled precision nanomedicines for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.








Abstract
Nanomedicines that target specific blood cells represent an emerging strategy to improve drug biodistribution. However, the protein corona usually disrupts nanomedicine targeting to cells and tissues. Herein, instead of exploring synthetic methods to mitigate the impact of the protein corona, its natural interactions with blood cells are leveraged and turn the protein corona into an active ingredient in treating lung inflammation. It is discovered that molecularly engineered liposomes with inverse phosphocholine lipids rapidly enrich complement fragment iC3b by &#8220;voluntary opsonization,&#8221; which triggers neutrophil hijacking through complement receptor 3 phagocytosis. This neutrophil targeting is cell&#8208;state dependent as only those activated by acute inflammation display efficient neutrophil reconstruction. The liposome&#8208;loaded neutrophils migrate across the alveolar&#8208;capillary barrier, accumulate in the inflamed lung parenchyma within hours, and release their payloads to kill the bacteria. This work shows that, in addition to biological cells, the protein corona can be a new platform for active and precision nanomedicine.

         <title>Reaction Mechanism and Structural Evolution of Fluorographite Cathodes in Solid&#8208;State K/Na/Li Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 3, January 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The real&#8208;time K/Na/Li ion insertion mobility and reaction mechanism of the CFx cathode are studied using an in situ all&#8208;solid&#8208;state nanobattery transmission electron microscopy (TEM) technique. A two&#8208;phase reaction is discovered with crystalline KF (NaF nanoparticles and amorphous LiF) generated uniformly within an amorphous carbon matrix, retaining an unchanged volume during alkali&#8208;ion intercalation.








Abstract
Fluorographites (CFx) are ultrahigh&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathode materials for alkaline&#8208;metal primary batteries. However, they are generally not rechargeable. To elucidate the reaction mechanism of CFx cathodes, in situ transmission electron microscopy characterizations and ab initio calculations are employed. It is found that it is a two&#8208;phase mechanism upon K/Na/Li ion insertion; crystalline KF (crystalline NaF nanoparticles and amorphous LiF) is generated uniformly within the amorphous carbon matrix, retaining an unchanged volume during the discharge process. The diffusivity for K/Na/Li ion migration within the CFx is &#8776;2.2&#8211;2.5 &#215; 10&#8211;12, 3.4&#8211;5.3 &#215; 10&#8211;12 , and 1.8&#8211;2.5 &#215; 10&#8211;11 cm2 s&#8211;1, respectively, which is comparable to the diffusivity of K/Na/Li ions in liquid&#8208;state cells. Encouraged by the in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results, a new rechargeable all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li/CFx battery is further designed that shows a part of the reversible specific discharge capacity at the 2nd cycle. These findings demonstrate that a solid&#8208;state electrolyte provides a different reaction process compared with a conventional liquid electrolyte, and enables CFx to be partly rechargeable in solid&#8208;state Li batteries.

         <title>Self&#8208;Driven Perovskite Narrowband Photodetectors with Tunable Spectral Responses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 3, January 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Filterless and self&#8208;driven charge&#8208;collection&#8208;narrowing (CCN)&#8208;type perovskite narrowband photodetectors are fabricated with tunable spectral responses from the red to the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region. Specifically, the MAPbI3&#8208;based narrowband photodetector exhibits remarkable performances at 800&#160;nm, with full&#8208;width at half maximum less than 30&#160;nm, which are comparable to the highest reported values, allowing the successful demonstration of narrowband imaging.








Abstract
Narrowband photodetectors with tunable spectral responses are highly desirable for applications in image sensing, machine vision, and optical communication. Herein, a filterless and self&#8208;driven perovskite narrowband photodetector (PNPD) based on the defect&#8208;assisted charge collection narrowing (CCN) mechanism is reported, which is enabled by a high&#8208;quality thick perovskite film. By adjusting the halide component of the perovskite layer, the bandgap is successfully modulated and the corresponding narrowband photodetectors show a wide spectral response range from the red to the near&#8208;infrared (NIR), all with full&#8208;widths at half maximum (FWHMs) below 30&#160;nm. Specifically, the methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) narrowband photodetector exhibits a characteristic detection peak at 800&#160;nm with a very low noise current of &#8776;0.02 pA Hz&#8211;1/2, a high specific detectivity up to 1.27 &#215; 1012 Jones, and a fast response speed with rise/fall time of 12.7/6.9 &#181;s. Impressively, these values are among the highest of their kind reported previously, and allow demonstration of narrowband imaging. The excellent performance of self&#8208;driven PNPDs lights up their prospect in high&#8208;efficiency optoelectronic devices without external power sources.

         <title>Reversible Crystal&#8211;Glass Transition in a Metal Halide Perovskite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 3, January 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic metal halide perovskites are introduced into the field of semiconducting glasses through deliberate synthetic design of the hybrid structure, resulting in facile and reversible glass&#8211;crystalline switching under moderate thermal cycling. Such glasses can find prospective application in, for example, memory, computing, nonlinear optics, communication, catalysis, sensing, and batteries.








Abstract
Crystalline metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have provided unprecedented advances in interdisciplinary fields of materials, electronics, and photonics. While crystallinity offers numerous advantages, the ability to access a glassy state with distinct properties provides unique opportunities to extend the associated structure&#8211;property relationship, as well as broaden the application space for MHPs. Amorphous analogs for MHPs have so far been restricted to high pressures, limiting detailed studies and applications. Here, a 2D MHP is structurally tailored using bulky chiral organic cations to exhibit an unusual confluence of exceptionally low melting temperature (175&#160;&#176;C) and inhibited crystallization. The chiral MHP can thus be melt&#8208;quenched into a stable glassy state, otherwise inhibited in the analogous racemic MHP. Facile and reversible switching between glassy and crystalline states is demonstrated for the chiral MHP, each with distinct optoelectronic character, opening new opportunities for applications including, for example nonvolatile memory, optical communication, and neuromorphic computing.

         <title>Roles of MACl in Sequentially Deposited Bromine&#8208;Free Perovskite Absorbers for Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 3, January 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The role of methylammonium chloride (MACl) in sequentially deposited bromine (Br)&#8208;free formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3)&#8208;based perovskite is systematically demonstrated to regulate the PbI2/FAI reaction, tune the phase transition at room temperature, and adjust the PbI2 residual through an intermediate&#8208;related perovskite decomposition during thermal annealing. The resulting optimized solar cells achieve a remarkable efficiency of 23.1% with considerably improved photostability.








Abstract
So far, the combination of methylammonium bromide/methylammonium chloride (MABr/MACl) or methylammonium iodide (MAI)/MACl is the most frequently used additives to stabilize formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) fabricated by the sequential deposition method. However, the enlarged bandgap due to the addition of bromide and the ambiguous functions of these additives in lead iodide (PbI2) transformation are still worth considering. Herein, the roles of MACl in sequentially deposited Br&#8208;free FA&#8208;based perovskites are systematically investigated. It is found that MACl can finely regulate the PbI2/FAI reaction, tune the phase transition at room temperature, and adjust intermediate&#8208;related perovskite crystallization and decomposition during thermal annealing. Compared to FAPbI3, the perovskite with MACl exhibits larger grain, longer carrier lifetime, and reduced trap density. The resultant solar cell therefore achieves a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.1% under reverse scan with a stabilized power output of 23.0%. In addition, it shows much improved photostability under 100&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2 white illumination (xenon lamp) in nitrogen atmosphere without encapsulation.

         <title>Driving Force and Optical Signatures of Bipolaron Formation in Chemically Doped Conjugated Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 3, January 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemically doped donor&#8211;acceptor conjugated polymer is studied using ultrafast spectroscopy, showing conclusively that the carriers created by doping are exclusively bipolarons and not single polarons at all doping levels. DFT calculations show that the physical size of the donor unit is what determines the relative stability of polarons and bipolarons in push&#8211;pull semiconducting polymer systems.








Abstract
Molecular dopants are often added to semiconducting polymers to improve electrical conductivity. However, the use of such dopants does not always produce mobile charge carriers. In this work, ultrafast spectroscopy is used to explore the nature of the carriers created following doping of conjugated push&#8211;pull polymers with both F4TCNQ (2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane) and FeCl3. It is shown that for one particular push&#8211;pull material, the charge carriers created by doping are entirely non&#8208;conductive bipolarons and not single polarons, and that transient absorption spectroscopy following excitation in the infrared can readily distinguish the two types of charge carriers. Based on density functional theory calculations and experiments on multiple push&#8211;pull conjugated polymers, it is argued that the size of the donor push units determines the relative stabilities of polarons and bipolarons, with larger donor units stabilizing the bipolarons by providing more area for two charges to&#160;co&#8208;reside.

         <title>Multifunctional Reversible Self&#8208;Assembled Structures of Cellulose&#8208;Derived Phase&#8208;Change Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 3, January 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phase&#8208;change nanocrystals (C18&#8208;UCNCs) are prepared via surface esterification and further thiol&#8211;ene reaction on cellulose nanocrystals. These nanocrystals can assemble into flaky structures in the solid&#8208;state, which exhibit excellent thermoinduced imaging property, thermoinduced reversibility, and a self&#8208;healing property. The multifunctional flaky structures can manipulate energy conversion, surface morphology, surface wetting, and optical properties, largely expanding their potential uses in various fields.








Abstract
Owing to advantageous properties attributed to well&#8208;organized structures, multifunctional materials with reversible hierarchical and highly ordered arrangement in solid&#8208;state assembled structures have drawn tremendous interest. However, such materials rarely exist. Based on the reversible phase transition of phase&#8208;change materials (PCMs), phase&#8208;change nanocrystals (C18&#8208;UCNCs) are presented herein, which are capable of self&#8208;assembling into well&#8208;ordered hierarchical structures. C18&#8208;UCNCs have a core&#8211;shell structure consisting of a cellulose crystalline core that retains the basic structure and a soft shell containing octadecyl chains that allow phase transition. The distinct core&#8211;shell structure and phase transition of octadecyl chains allow C18&#8208;UCNCs to self&#8208;assemble into flaky nano/microstructures. These self&#8208;assembled C18&#8208;UCNCs exhibit efficient thermal transport and light&#8208;to&#8208;thermal energy conversion, and thus are promising for thermosensitive imaging. Specifically, flaky self&#8208;assembled nano/microstructures with manipulable surface morphology, surface wetting, and optical properties are thermoreversible and show thermally induced self&#8208;healing properties. By using phase&#8208;change nanocrystals as a novel group of PCMs, reversible self&#8208;assembled multifunctional materials can be engineered. This study proposes a promising approach for constructing self&#8208;assembled hierarchical structures by using phase&#8208;change nanocrystals and thereby significantly expands the application of PCMs.

         <title>Hammett Relationship in Oxidase&#8208;Mimicking Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Revealed through a Protein&#8208;Engineering&#8208;Inspired Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 3, January 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Studying the structure&#8211;activity relationships of nanozymes requires overcoming the composition&#8208; and site&#8208;heterogeneity limitations in nanomaterials. Inspired by natural metalloenzymes, a set of substituted metal&#8211;organic frameworks is employed, and a Hammett&#8208;type structure&#8211;activity linear free energy relationship is revealed, where increasing Hammett &#963;m value leads to the enhancement of the oxidase&#8208;mimicking activity.








Abstract
While the unique physicochemical properties of nanomaterials that enable regulation of nanozyme activities are demonstrated in many systems, quantitative relationships between the nanomaterials structure and their enzymatic activities remain poorly understood, due to the heterogeneity of compositions and active sites in these nanomaterials. Here, inspired by metalloenzymes with well&#8208;defined metal&#8211;ligand coordination, a set of substituted metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with similar coordination is employed to investigate the relationship between structure and oxidase&#8208;mimicking activity. Both experimental results and density functional theory calculations reveal a Hammett&#8208;type structure&#8211;activity linear free energy relationship (H&#8208;SALR) of MIL&#8208;53(Fe) (MIL = Materials of Institute Lavoisier) nanozymes, in which increasing the Hammett &#963;m value with electron&#8208;withdrawing ligands increases the oxidase&#8208;mimicking activity. As a result, MIL&#8208;53(Fe) &#63743;NO2 with the strongest electron&#8208;withdrawing NO2 substituent shows a tenfold higher activity than the unsubstituted MIL&#8208;53(Fe). Furthermore, the generality of H&#8208;SALR is demonstrated for a range of substrates, one other metal (Cr), and even one other MOF type (MIL&#8208;101). Such biologically inspired quantitative studies demonstrate that it is possible to identify quantitative structure&#8211;activity relationships of nanozymes, and to provide detailed insight into the catalytic mechanisms as those in native enzymes, making it possible to use these relationships to develop high&#8208;performance nanomaterials.

A type of 2D hierarchical metamaterial that incorporates kirigami&#8208;inspired bilayer actuating elements into periodic lattice patterns to allow for giant positive/negative coefficients of thermal expansion (CTEs) is developed. Quantitative comparison to existing mechanical metamaterials suggests that the presented hierarchical metamaterials can substantially enlarge the accessible range of CTE in the Ashby plot, by nearly an order of magnitude for the biaxial CTE.








Abstract
Advanced mechanical metamaterials with unusual thermal expansion properties represent an area of growing interest, due to their promising potential for use in a broad range of areas. In spite of previous work on metamaterials with large or ultralow coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), achieving a broad range of CTE values with access to large thermally induced dimensional changes in structures with high filling ratios remains a key challenge. Here, design concepts and fabrication strategies for a kirigami&#8208;inspired class of 2D hierarchical metamaterials that can effectively convert the thermal mismatch between two closely packed constituent materials into giant levels of biaxial/uniaxial thermal expansion/shrinkage are presented. At large filling ratios (&gt;50%), these systems offer not only unprecedented negative and positive biaxial CTE (i.e., &#8722;5950 and 10 710&#160;ppm K&#8722;1), but also large biaxial thermal expansion properties (e.g., &gt;&#160;21% for 20 K temperature increase). Theoretical modeling of thermal deformations provides a clear understanding of the microstructure&#8211;property relationships and serves as a basis for design choices for desired CTE values. An Ashby plot of the CTE versus density serves as a quantitative comparison of the hierarchical metamaterials presented here to previously reported systems, indicating the capability for substantially enlarging the accessible range of CTE.

In article 2005255, Byeong&#8208;Soo Bae, Tae&#8208;Woo Lee, and co&#8208;workers report exceptionally stable crosslinked perovskite nanoparticles (NPs) under harsh environments, with a novel composite materials design strategy. Noticeably, the crosslinked perovskite NPs (CPNs) show recovery of photoluminescence in the initial stage and retain their photophysical properties under humidified environments. The CPNs overcome the instability of perovskite NPs in air, water, and strong chemicals as well as under high temperature.

         <title>The Earth's Lithosphere Inspires Materials Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 3, January 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel lithomimetic approach is proposed, which entails mimicking structures and processes occurring in the Earth's lithosphere to produce man&#8208;made advanced materials. Severe plastic deformation is considered as a viable vehicle for that.








Abstract
Structural patterns found in living organisms have long been inspiring biomimetic materials design. Here, it is suggested that a rich palette of patterns occurring in inanimate Nature, and especially in the Earth's lithosphere, could be not less inspirational for design of novel architectured materials. This materials design paradigm is referred to as lithomimetics and it is demonstrated that some of the patterns found in the lithosphere can be emulated by established processes of severe plastic deformation. This opens up interesting avenues for materials design in which potentially promising structural patterns are borrowed from the lithosphere's repository. The key aim here is to promulgate the &#8220;lithomimetics&#8221; paradigm as a promising approach to developing novel architectured materials.

         <title>The Art of Constructing Black Phosphorus Nanosheet Based Heterostructures: From 2D to 3D</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 3, January 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Black phosphorus nanosheet (BPNS)&#8208;based heterostructures are an emerging material with numerous potential applications in many appealing fields. Recent advancements in the construction of BPNS&#8208;based heterostructures ranging from 2D hybrid structures to 3D networks, including preparation and characterization methods, optical and electronic properties, applications, challenges, and future directions, are discussed.








Abstract
Assembling different kinds of 2D nanosheets into heterostructures presents a promising way of designing novel artificial materials with new and improved functionalities by combining the unique properties of each component. In the past few years, black phosphorus nanosheets (BPNSs) have been recognized as a highly feasible 2D material with outstanding electronic properties, a tunable bandgap, and strong in&#8208;plane anisotropy, highlighting their suitability as a material for constructing heterostructures. In this study, recent progress in the construction of BPNS&#8208;based heterostructures ranging from 2D hybrid structures to 3D networks is discussed, emphasizing the different types of interactions (covalent or noncovalent) between individual layers. The preparation methods, optical and electronic properties, and various applications of these heterostructures&#8212;including electronic and optoelectronic devices, energy storage devices, photocatalysis and electrocatalysis, and biological applications&#8212;are discussed. Finally, critical challenges and prospective research aspects in BPNS&#8208;based heterostructures are also highlighted.

         <title>3D Interfacing between Soft Electronic Tools and Complex Biological Tissues</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 3, January 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Soft electronics enable biocompatible interfaces for physiological sensing and stimulation. However, their typical forms as 2D sheets create difficulties for integration with organs and tissues with complex 3D geometry. Recent strategies involve a transformation of soft electronic tools for building adaptive 3D interfaces with natural organs and tissues, providing advanced capabilities for biological research and therapeutic innovation.








Abstract
Recent developments in soft functional materials have created opportunities for building bioelectronic devices with tissue&#8208;like mechanical properties. Their integration with the human body could enable advanced sensing and stimulation for medical diagnosis and therapies. However, most of the available soft electronics are constructed as planar sheets, which are difficult to interface with the target organs and tissues that have complex 3D structures. Here, the recent approaches are highlighted to building 3D interfaces between soft electronic tools and complex biological organs and tissues. Examples involve mesh devices for conformal contact, imaging&#8208;guided fabrication of organ&#8208;specific electronics, miniaturized probes for neurointerfaces, instrumented scaffold for tissue engineering, and many other soft 3D systems. They represent diverse routes for reconciling the interfacial mismatches between electronic tools and biological tissues. The remaining challenges include device scaling to approach the complexity of target organs, biological data acquisition and processing, 3D manufacturing techniques, etc., providing a range of opportunities for scientific research and technological innovation.

         <title>Nanocellulose: Recent Fundamental Advances and Emerging Biological and Biomimicking Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 3, January 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanocelluloses have recently become the focal point of sustainable nanoconstruction. Beyond the classic approaches dealing with, for example, reinforced nanocomposites, barriers, films, and structural color, the fundamental interactions within nanocelluloses, multifunctional hybrid gels, multicomponent fibers, and nanocelluloses in artificial photosynthesis are reviewed.








Abstract
In the effort toward sustainable advanced functional materials, nanocelluloses have attracted extensive recent attention. Nanocelluloses range from rod&#8208;like highly crystalline cellulose nanocrystals to longer and more entangled cellulose nanofibers, earlier denoted also as microfibrillated celluloses and bacterial cellulose. In recent years, they have spurred research toward a wide range of applications, ranging from nanocomposites, viscosity modifiers, films, barrier layers, fibers, structural color, gels, aerogels and foams, and energy applications, until filtering membranes, to name a few. Still, nanocelluloses continue to show surprisingly high challenges to master their interactions and tailorability to allow well&#8208;controlled assemblies for functional materials. Rather than trying to review the already extensive nanocellulose literature at large, here selected aspects of the recent progress are the focus. Water interactions, which are central for processing for the functional properties, are discussed first. Then advanced hybrid gels toward (multi)stimuli responses, shape&#8208;memory materials, self&#8208;healing, adhesion and gluing, biological scaffolding, and forensic applications are discussed. Finally, composite fibers are discussed, as well as nanocellulose as a strategy for improvement of photosynthesis&#8208;based chemicals production. In summary, selected perspectives toward new directions for sustainable high&#8208;tech functional materials science based on nanocelluloses are described.

         <title>Hetero&#8208;MXenes: Theory, Synthesis, and Emerging Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive overview of hetero&#8208;MXenes, from theoretical predictions to experimental investigations, is presented. The reviewed theoretical calculations focus on three sites of MXenes and the reviewed metal&#8208;/nonmetal&#8208;doped/substituted MXenes are experimentally synthesized by in situ/ex situ strategies. It is believed that this work will be beneficial to bridge the predictions and experiments, further promoting the development of hetero&#8208;MXenes.








Abstract
Since their discovery in 2011, MXenes (abbreviation for transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides) have emerged as a rising star in the family of 2D materials owing to their unique properties. Although the primary research interest is still focused on pristine MXenes and their composites, much attention has in recent years been paid also to MXenes with diverse compositions. To this end, this work offers a comprehensive overview of the progress on compositional engineering of MXenes in terms of doping and substituting from theoretical predictions to experimental investigations. Synthesis and properties are briefly introduced for pristine MXenes and then reviewed for hetero&#8208;MXenes. Theoretical calculations regarding the doping/substituting at M, X, and T sites in MXenes and the role of vacancies are summarized. After discussing the synthesis of hetero&#8208;MXenes with metal/nonmetal (N, S, P) elements by in situ and ex situ strategies, the focus turns to their emerging applications in various fields such as energy storage, electrocatalysts, and sensors. Finally, challenges and prospects of hetero&#8208;MXenes are addressed. It is anticipated that this review will be beneficial to bridge the gap between predictions and experiments as well as to guide the future design of hetero&#8208;MXenes with high performance.

The reviewed theoretical calculations focus on three sites of MXenes and the reviewed metal&#8208;/nonmetal&#8208;doped/substituted MXenes are experimentally synthesized by in situ/ex situ strategies. It is believed that this work will be beneficial to bridge the predictions and experiments, further promoting the development of hetero&#8208;MXenes.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since their discovery in 2011, MXenes (abbreviation for transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides) have emerged as a rising star in the family of 2D materials owing to their unique properties. Although the primary research interest is still focused on pristine MXenes and their composites, much attention has in recent years been paid also to MXenes with diverse compositions. To this end, this work offers a comprehensive overview of the progress on compositional engineering of MXenes in terms of doping and substituting from theoretical predictions to experimental investigations. Synthesis and properties are briefly introduced for pristine MXenes and then reviewed for hetero&#8208;MXenes. Theoretical calculations regarding the doping/substituting at M, X, and T sites in MXenes and the role of vacancies are summarized. After discussing the synthesis of hetero&#8208;MXenes with metal/nonmetal (N, S, P) elements by in situ and ex situ strategies, the focus turns to their emerging applications in various fields such as energy storage, electrocatalysts, and sensors. Finally, challenges and prospects of hetero&#8208;MXenes are addressed. It is anticipated that this review will be beneficial to bridge the gap between predictions and experiments as well as to guide the future design of hetero&#8208;MXenes with high performance.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Design, Fabrication, and Mechanism of Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Graphene&#8208;Based Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene plays a significant role in photocatalysis. Rational design, preparation, and understanding the mechanism of N&#8208;doped graphene&#8208;based photocatalyst provide a new opportunity to further enhance the photocatalytic performance. The research progress, atomic and band structures, photocatalytic mechanism, synthesis strategy, unique advantages, and wide application of N&#8208;doped graphene in photocatalysis are highlighted.








Abstract
Solving energy and environmental problems through solar&#8208;driven photocatalysis is an attractive and challenging topic. Hence, various types of photocatalysts have been developed successively to address the demands of photocatalysis. Graphene&#8208;based materials have elicited considerable attention since the discovery of graphene. As a derivative of graphene, nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene (NG) particularly stands out. Nitrogen atoms can break the undifferentiated structure of graphene and open the bandgap while endowing graphene with an uneven electron density distribution. Therefore, NG retains nearly all the advantages of original graphene and is equipped with several novel properties, ensuring infinite possibilities for NG&#8208;based photocatalysis. This review introduces the atomic and band structures of NG, summarizes in situ and ex situ synthesis methods, highlights the mechanism and advantages of NG in photocatalysis, and outlines its applications in different photocatalysis directions (primarily hydrogen production, CO2 reduction, pollutant degradation, and as photoactive ingredient). Lastly, the central challenges and possible improvements of NG&#8208;based photocatalysis in the future are presented. This study is expected to learn from the past and achieve progress toward the future for NG&#8208;based photocatalysis.

         <title>Paper&#8208;Embedded Roll&#8208;to&#8208;Roll Mass Printed Piezoelectric Transducers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Paper&#8208;based fully roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll manufactured flexible lightweight large&#8208;area piezoelectric transducers are presented. Embedding the printed electronic layers into conventional paper webs by inline lamination and inline poling leads to piezoelectric devices with high remnant polarization and high production yield. The development gives the opportunity i.a. for novel surround sound installations of several meter length.








Abstract
The trend to a world with ubiquitous electronics has the need for novel concepts for sensors and actuators that are lightweight, flexible, low&#8208;cost, and also sustainable. Piezoelectric transducers on the basis of functional polymers can meet these expectations. In this work, a novel concept for paper&#8208;embedded large&#8208;area piezoelectric devices realized solely by means of roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll (R2R) mass printing and post printing technologies including inline poling are introduced. The device set&#8208;up, as well as the process technology, offers the great opportunity for a cost&#8208;efficient and environmentally friendly mass production of thin and flexible organic large&#8208;area piezoelectric devices. As the functional layers are embedded into paper by the hot lamination of two poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;trifluoroethylene) P(VDF&#8208;TrFE) layers, the printed electronics is protected and invisible. The paper gives insights to the R2R printing of a 500 m long web including R2R post printing processes and electrical and acoustic inline characterization. Fully R2R processed devices show a high remnant polarization of up to 78&#160;mC&#160;m&#8722;2 and can be realized with high yield of &gt;90%.&#160;Finally, a 360&#176; surround&#8208;sound installation realized with a 387&#160;cm long paper web consisting of 56 piezoelectric speakers including wiring is presented.

         <title>Lattice Matching Growth of Conductive Hierarchical Porous MOF/LDH Heteronanotube Arrays for Highly Efficient Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous metal&#8211;organic framework/layered double hydroxide (MOF/LDH) hierarchical heteronanotube arrays consisting of a lattice&#8208;matched 2D conductive MOF and a trimetallic LDH, established by an inner template sacrifice process, enable excellent activity and superior stability toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) reaction among the best MOF and non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts for OER.








Abstract
The conjugation of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) into different multicomponent materials to precisely construct aligned heterostructures is fascinating but elusive owing to the disparate interfacial energy and nucleation kinetics. Herein, a promising lattice&#8208;matching growth strategy is demonstrated for conductive MOF/layered double hydroxide (cMOF/LDH) heteronanotube arrays with highly ordered hierarchical porous structures enabling an ultraefficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER). CoNiFe&#8208;LDH nanowires are used as interior template to engineer an interface by inlaying cMOF and matching two crystal lattice systems, thus conducting a graft growth of cMOF/LDH heterostructures along the LDH nanowire. A class of hierarchical porous cMOF/LDH heteronanotube arrays is produced through continuously regulating the transformation degree. The synergistic effects of the cMOF and LDH components significantly promote the chemical and electronic structures of the heteronanotube arrays and their electroactive surface area. Optimized heteronanotube arrays exhibit extraordinary OER activity with ultralow overpotentials of 216 and 227&#160;mV to deliver current densities of 50 and 100 mA cm&#8722;2 with a small Tafel slope of 34.1 mV dec&#8722;1, ranking it among the best MOF and non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts for OER. The robust performance under high current density and vigorous gas bubble conditions enable such hierarchical MOF/LDH heteronanotube arrays as promising materials for practical water electrolysis.

         <title>New Frontiers in 3D Structural Sensing Robots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sensing robots synergically merge 3D integrated sensors and robotics. Geometrical difficulty from the structural complexity of sensing robots has been the main challenge in the production of sensing robots. 3D integrated electronics prepared by 3D printing is a potential solution for realistic sensing robot systems. The platform of 3D sensing systems is investigated, and their expansion into sensing robots is studied further in practical settings such as in healthcare and manufacturing units. The progress toward sensing robots from 3D electronics integrated into 3D objects is discussed.








Abstract
Advanced robotics is the result of various contributions from complex fields of science and engineering and has tremendous value in human society. Sensing robots are highly desirable in practical settings such as healthcare and manufacturing sectors through sensing activities from human&#8211;robot interaction. However, there are still ongoing research and technical challenges in the development of ideal sensing robot systems. The sensing robot should synergically merge sensors and robotics. Geometrical difficulty in the sensor positioning caused by the structural complexity of sensing robots and their corresponding processing have been the main challenges in the production of sensing robots. 3D electronics integrated into 3D objects prepared by the 3D printing process can be the potential solution for designing realistic sensing robot systems. 3D printing provides the advantage to manufacture complex 3D structures in electronics in a single setup, allowing the ease of design flexibility, and customized functions. Therefore, the platform of 3D sensing systems is investigated and their expansion into sensing robots is studied further. The progress toward sensing robots from 3D electronics integrated into 3D objects and the advanced material strategies, used to overcome the challenges, are discussed.

         <title>A Brief History of OLEDs&#8212;Emitter Development and Industry Milestones</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The history of emitter development and industry's interest in organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) technology are reviewed. OLED device technology has equally inspired and driven innovation in academia and industry. Three generations of emitters based on different emission mechanisms are designed. Recently, research in both academia and industry points towards a fourth generation of light&#8208;emitting materials for OLEDs.








Abstract
Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) have come a long way ever since their first introduction in 1987 at Eastman Kodak. Today, OLEDs are especially valued in the display and lighting industry for their promising features. As one of the research fields that equally inspires and drives development in academia and industry, OLED device technology has continuously evolved over more than 30&#160;years. OLED devices have come forward based on three generations of emitter materials relying on fluorescence (first generation), phosphorescence (second generation), and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (third generation). Furthermore, research in academia and industry toward the fourth generation of OLEDs is in progress. Excerpts from the history of green, orange&#8208;red, and blue OLED emitter development on the side of academia and milestones achieved by key players in the industry are included in this report.

OLED device technology has equally inspired and driven innovation in academia and industry. Three generations of emitters based on different emission mechanisms are designed. Recently, research in both academia and industry points towards a fourth generation of light&#8208;emitting materials for OLEDs.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) have come a long way ever since their first introduction in 1987 at Eastman Kodak. Today, OLEDs are especially valued in the display and lighting industry for their promising features. As one of the research fields that equally inspires and drives development in academia and industry, OLED device technology has continuously evolved over more than 30&#160;years. OLED devices have come forward based on three generations of emitter materials relying on fluorescence (first generation), phosphorescence (second generation), and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (third generation). Furthermore, research in academia and industry toward the fourth generation of OLEDs is in progress. Excerpts from the history of green, orange&#8208;red, and blue OLED emitter development on the side of academia and milestones achieved by key players in the industry are included in this report.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Micellar Lyotropic Nematic Gels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By adding low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight gelators to lyotropic nematic phases a new kind of liquid crystal network, namely lyotropic nematic physical gels, is obtained. These lyotropic nematic gels combine anisotropy with mechanical stability and are promising new materials for the field of soft robotics and biomimetic actuation.








Abstract
Lyotropic liquid crystal (LLC) gels are a new class of liquid crystal (LC) networks that combine the anisotropy of micellar LLCs with the mechanical stability of a gel. However, so far, only micellar LLC gels with lamellar and hexagonal structures have been obtained by the addition of gelators to LLCs. Here, the first examples of lyotropic nematic gels are presented. The key to obtain these nematic gels is the use of gelators that have a non&#8208;amphiphilic molecular structure and thus leave the size and shape of the micellar aggregates essentially unchanged. By adding these gelators to lyotropic nematic phases, an easy and reproducible way to obtain large amounts of lyotropic nematic gels is established. These nematic gels preserve the long&#8208;range orientational order and optical birefringence of a lyotropic nematic phase but have the mechanical stability of a gel. LLC nematic gels are promising new materials for elastic and anisotropic hydrogels to be applied as water&#8208;based stimuli&#8208;responsive actuators and sensors.

         <title>Inelastic Electron Tunneling Spectroscopy at High&#8208;Temperatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inelastic tunneling spectroscopy is shown to be a viable high&#8208;resolution technique to analyze mobile species in solids at high&#8208;temperatures. In the measurements reported, BaZrO3&#8208;based heterostructures are used as proton conductors and tunnel barriers. By analyzing O&#63743;H bond vibrations at 400 K, the existence of protons in the tunnel barriers is demonstrated.








Abstract
Ion conducting materials are critical components of batteries, fuel cells, and devices such as memristive switches. Analytical tools are therefore sought that allow the behavior of ions in solids to be monitored and analyzed with high spatial resolution and in real time. In principle, inelastic tunneling spectroscopy offers these capabilities. However, as its spectral resolution is limited by thermal softening of the Fermi&#8211;Dirac distribution, tunneling spectroscopy is usually constrained to cryogenic temperatures. This constraint would seem to render tunneling spectroscopy useless for studying ions in motion. Here, the first inelastic tunneling spectroscopy studies above room temperature are reported. For these measurements, high&#8208;temperature&#8208;stable tunnel junctions that incorporate within the tunnel barrier ultrathin layers for efficient proton conduction are developed. By analyzing the vibrational modes of O&#63743;H bonds in BaZrO3&#8208;based heterostructures, the detection of protons with a spectral resolution of 20 meV at 400 K (full&#8208;width&#8208;at&#8208;half maximum) is demonstrated. Overturning the hitherto existing prediction for the spectral resolution limit of 186 meV (5.4 kBT ) at 400 K, this resolution enables high&#8208;temperature tunneling spectroscopy of ion conductors. With these advances, inelastic tunneling spectroscopy constitutes a novel, valuable analytical tool for solid&#8208;state ionics.

         <title>A Programmable DNA&#8208;Silicification&#8208;Based Nanocavity for Single&#8208;Molecule Plasmonic Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrating advances in DNA nanotechnology and plasmonic sensing, this study reports a method, termed DNA&#8208;silicified template for Raman optical beacon (DNA&#8208;STROBE), for development of ultrasmall and structurally resilient nanocavities with high fidelity. The DNA&#8208;STROBE constructs exhibit large, controlled local electromagnetic field enhancement for reproducible single&#8208;molecule surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopic sensing even at elevated background concentrations.








Abstract
Plasmonic nanocavities are highly desirable for optical sensing because of their singular ability to confine light into deep subwavelength volumes. Yet, it remains profoundly challenging to fabricate structurally resilient nanocavities with high fidelity, and to obtain direct, noninvasive visualization of the plasmonic hotspots within such constructs. Herein, highly precise and robust nanocavities, entitled DNA&#8208;silicified template for Raman optical beacon (DNA&#8208;STROBE), are engineered by using silicified DNA scaffolds for spatial organization of discrete plasmonic nanoparticles. In addition to substantially enhancing structural stability and chemical inertness, DNA silicification significantly improves nanogap control, resulting simultaneously in large and controlled local electromagnetic field enhancement. The ultrasmall mode volume of the DNA&#8208;STROBE constructs promotes single&#8208;molecule occupancy enabling surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) observations of single&#8208;molecule activity even at elevated background concentration, significantly relaxing the restrictive pico&#8208; to nanomolar molecular concentration condition typically required for such investigations. Additionally, leveraging super&#8208;resolution SERS measurements allows noninvasive and diffraction&#8208;unlimited spatial profiling of otherwise unresolvable plasmonic hotspots. The highly programmable and reproducible nature of the DNA&#8208;STROBE, coupled with its quantitative label&#8208;free molecular readouts, provides a versatile platform with applications across the spectrum of nanophotonics and biomedical sciences.

         <title>Structure Design of Long&#8208;Life Spinel&#8208;Oxide Cathode Materials for Magnesium Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Defect spinel ZnMnO3 with cation deficiencies at octahedral sites allows highly reversible Mg insertion/extraction avoiding the irreversible transformation into a rocksalt phase. It is successfully demonstrated that the material can work as a high&#8208;performance cathode for magnesium rechargeable batteries exhibiting high potential (&#8776;2.5&#160;V vs Mg2+/Mg) and capacity (&#8776;100&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1) with long&#8208;term cyclability.








Abstract
Development of metal&#8208;anode rechargeable batteries is a challenging issue. Especially, magnesium rechargeable batteries are promising in that Mg metal can be free from dendrite formation upon charging. However, in case of oxide cathode materials, inserted magnesium tends to form MgO&#8208;like rocksalt clusters in a parent phase even with another structure, which causes poor cyclability. Here, a design concept of high&#8208;performance cathode materials is shown, based on: i) selecting an element to destabilize the rocksalt&#8208;type structure and ii) utilizing the defect&#8208;spinel&#8208;type structure both to avoid the spinel&#8208;to&#8208;rocksalt reaction and to secure the migration path of Mg cations. This theoretical and experimental work substantiates that a defect&#8208;spinel&#8208;type ZnMnO3 meets the above criteria and shows excellent cycle performance exceeding 100 cycles upon Mg insertion/extraction with high potential (&#8776;2.5&#160;V vs Mg2+/Mg) and capacity (&#8776;100&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1). Thus, this work would provide a design guideline of cathode materials for various multivalent rechargeable batteries.

         <title>Direct Synthesis and Enhanced Rectification of Alloy&#8208;to&#8208;Alloy 2D Type&#8208;II MoS2(1&#8208;x)Se2x/SnS2(1&#8208;y)Se2y Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The single&#8208;step growth of alloy/alloy (MoS2(1&#8208;x)Se2x/SnS2(1&#8208;y)Se2y) vertical heterostructures is demonstrated and the heterostructure exhibits nearly intrinsic Van der Waals (vdW) interface in terms of a near&#8208;atomically sharp and defect&#8208;free boundary along the interface as well as a well&#8208;aligned epitaxial relationship. The almost&#8208;ideal interface enables the identification of the intrinsic behaviors of the heterostructures such as the band alignment, charge transfer, and carrier transport.








Abstract
The interfacial tunable band alignment of heterostructures is coveted in device design and optimization of device performance. As an intentional approach, alloying allows band engineering and continuous band&#8208;edge tunability for low&#8208;dimensional semiconductors. Thus, combining the tunability of alloying with the band structure of a heterostructure is highly desirable for the improvement of device characteristics. In this work, the single&#8208;step growth of alloy&#8208;to&#8208;alloy (MoS2(1&#8208;x)Se2x/SnS2(1&#8208;y)Se2y) 2D vertical heterostructures is demonstrated. Electron diffraction reveals the well&#8208;aligned heteroepitaxial relationship for the heterostructure, and a near&#8208;atomically sharp and defect&#8208;free boundary along the interface is observed. The nearly intrinsic van der Waals (vdW) interface enables measurement of the intrinsic behaviors of the heterostructures. The optimized type&#8208;II band alignment for the MoS2(1&#8208;x)Se2x/SnS2(1&#8208;y)Se2y heterostructure, along with the large band offset and effective charge transfer, is confirmed through quenched PL spectroscopy combined with density functional theory calculations. Devices based on completely stacked heterostructures show one or two orders enhanced electron&#160;mobility and rectification ratio than those of the constituent materials.

&lt;p&gt;The interfacial tunable band alignment of heterostructures is coveted in device design and optimization of device performance. As an intentional approach, alloying allows band engineering and continuous band&#8208;edge tunability for low&#8208;dimensional semiconductors. Thus, combining the tunability of alloying with the band structure of a heterostructure is highly desirable for the improvement of device characteristics. In this work, the single&#8208;step growth of alloy&#8208;to&#8208;alloy (MoS&lt;sub&gt;2(1&#8208;&lt;/sub&gt;

         <title>3D&#8208;Printable Fluoropolymer Gas Diffusion Layers for CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiscale structural control in 3D&#8208;printable fluoropolymers enables highly tunable gas diffusion electrodes. By modulating the diffusion of reactants to and products from the catalyst layer during electroreduction, the product distribution in favor of higher carbon products is shifted. Insights into the rational design of electrodes offer a platform for developing and optimizing next&#8208;generation flow reactors.








Abstract
The electrosynthesis of value&#8208;added multicarbon products from CO2 is a promising strategy to shift chemical production away from fossil fuels. Particularly important is the rational design of gas diffusion electrode (GDE) assemblies to react selectively, at scale, and at high rates. However, the understanding of the gas diffusion layer (GDL) in these assemblies is limited for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR): particularly important, but incompletely understood, is how the GDL modulates product distributions of catalysts operating in high current density regimes &gt; 300&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Here, 3D&#8208;printable fluoropolymer GDLs with tunable microporosity and structure are reported and probe the effects of permeance, microstructural porosity, macrostructure, and surface morphology. Under a given choice of applied electrochemical potential and electrolyte, a 100&#215; increase in the C2H4:CO ratio due to GDL surface morphology design over a homogeneously porous equivalent and a 1.8&#215; increase in the C2H4 partial current density due to a pyramidal macrostructure are observed. These findings offer routes to improve CO2RR GDEs as a platform for 3D catalyst design.

         <title>MnO2&#8208;Based Materials for Environmental Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent experimental and computational research progress on modulation of MnO2 single&#8208;species and MnO2&#8208;based composites for environmental applications are summarized. MnO2 single&#8208;species can be modified through morphology control, structure construction, facet engineering, and element doping while MnO2&#8208;based composites can be tuned by construction of homojunctions, MnO2/semiconductor/conductor binary heterojunctions, and MnO2&#8208;based ternary heterojunctions.








Abstract
Manganese dioxide (MnO2) is a promising photo&#8211;thermo&#8211;electric&#8208;responsive semiconductor material for environmental applications, owing to its various favorable properties. However, the unsatisfactory environmental purification efficiency of this material has limited its further applications. Fortunately, in the last few years, significant efforts have been undertaken for improving the environmental purification efficiency of this material and understanding its underlying mechanism. Here, the aim is to summarize the recent experimental and computational research progress in the modification of MnO2 single species by morphology control, structure construction, facet engineering, and element doping. Moreover, the design and fabrication of MnO2&#8208;based composites via the construction of homojunctions and MnO2/semiconductor/conductor binary/ternary heterojunctions is discussed. Their applications in environmental purification systems, either as an adsorbent material for removing heavy metals, dyes, and microwave (MW) pollution, or as a thermal catalyst, photocatalyst, and electrocatalyst for the degradation of pollutants (water and gas, organic and inorganic) are also highlighted. Finally, the research gaps are summarized and a perspective on the challenges and the direction of future research in nanostructured MnO2&#8208;based materials in the field of environmental applications is presented. Therefore, basic guidance for rational design and fabrication of high&#8208;efficiency MnO2&#8208;based materials for comprehensive environmental applications is provided.

         <title>Challenges and Strategies toward Cathode Materials for Rechargeable Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in the design of cathode materials for potassium&#8208;ion batteries involving the use of hexacyanometalates, layered metal oxides, polyanionic frameworks, and organic compounds are reviewed. Particular emphasis is given to the intercalation reaction mechanism and the existing challenges and corresponding optimized strategies pertaining to cathode materials. Finally, an outlook of future perspectives for emerging potassium&#8208;ion batteries is presented.








Abstract
With increasing demand for grid&#8208;scale energy storage, potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) have emerged as promising complements or alternatives to commercial lithium&#8208;ion batteries owing to the low cost, natural abundance of potassium resources, the low standard reduction potential of potassium, and fascinating K+ transport kinetics in the electrolyte. However, the low energy density and unstable cycle life of cathode materials hamper their practical application. Therefore, cathode materials with high capacities, high redox potentials, and good structural stability are required with the advancement toward next&#8208;generation PIBs. To this end, understanding the structure&#8208;dependent intercalation electrochemistry and recognizing the existing issues relating to cathode materials are indispensable prerequisites. This review summarizes the recent advances of PIB cathode materials, including metal hexacyanometalates, layered metal oxides, polyanionic frameworks, and organic compounds, with an emphasis on the structural advantages of the K+ intercalation reaction. Moreover, major current challenges with corresponding strategies for each category of cathode materials are highlighted. Finally, future research directions and perspectives are presented to accelerate the development of PIBs and facilitate commercial applications. It is believed that this review will provide practical guidance for researchers engaged in developing next&#8208;generation advanced PIB cathode materials.

         <title>Liquid Metals: A Novel Possibility of Fabricating 2D Metal Oxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in the fabrication of 2D metal oxides (2DMOs) via liquid metals are comprehensively reviewed. The introduction of progress in fabricating 2DMOs by virtue of the features of liquid metals improves diversity in the development and applications of 2DMOs. The current challenges concerning the fabrication of 2DMOs are discussed to promote future research.








Abstract
2D metal oxides (2DMOs) have been widely applied in the fields of electronic, magnetic, optical, and catalytic materials, owing to their rich surface chemistry and unique electronic structures. However, their further development faces challenges such as the difficulty in fabricating 2DMOs with unstable surface induced by strong surface polarizability, or the high cost and limited yield of the fabrication process. Recently, liquid metals have shown great potential in the fabrication of 2DMOs. The native oxide skin formed on the surface of liquid metals can be considered as a perfect 2D planar material. Due to the solubility, fluidity, and reactivity of liquid metals, they can act as the solvent, reactant, and interface in the fabrication of 2DMOs. Moreover, liquid metals undergo a liquid&#8211;solid phase transition, enabling them to be a symmetric matched substrate for growing high&#8208;quality 2DMOs. An insightful survey of the recent progress in this research direction is presented. The features of liquid metals including good solubility, chemical reactivity, weak interface force, and liquid&#8211;solid phase transitions are introduced in detail. Furthermore, strategies for the fabrication of 2DMOs by virtue of these features are summarized comprehensively. Finally, current challenges and prospects regarding the future development in the fabrication of 2DMOs via liquid metals are highlighted.

         <title>Controllable Capillary Assembly of Magnetic Ellipsoidal Janus Particles into Tunable Rings, Chains and Hexagonal Lattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic ellipsoidal Janus particles assemble into rings, chains, and hexagonal&#8208;lattice structures at fluid&#8211;fluid interfaces driven by capillary interactions, where a dynamical transition between these assembly states can be obtained by dynamically manipulating the external magnetic field.








Abstract
Colloidal assembly at fluid interfaces has a great potential for the bottom&#8208;up fabrication of novel structured materials. However, challenges remain in realizing controllable and tunable assembly of particles into diverse structures. Herein, the capillary assembly of magnetic ellipsoidal Janus particles at a fluid&#8211;fluid interface is reported. Depending on their tilt angle, that is, the angle the particle main axis forms with the fluid interface, these particles deform the interface and generate capillary dipoles or hexapoles. Driven by capillary interactions, multiple particles thus assemble into chain&#8208;, hexagonal&#8208;lattice&#8208;, and ring&#8208;like structures, which can be actively controlled by applying an external magnetic field. A field&#8208;strength phase diagram is predicted in which various structures are present as stable states. Owing to the diversity, controllability, and tunability of assembled structures, magnetic ellipsoidal Janus particles at fluid interfaces could therefore serve as versatile building blocks for novel&#160;materials.

         <title>Nanoparticle&#8208;Mediated Delivery of Inhaled Immunotherapeutics for Treating Lung Metastasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A noninvasive inhaled immunotherapeutic chitosan (CS)&#8211;antibody complex is developed for immunotherapy against lung cancer. In this system, CS with adjuvant effect is able to assemble with anti&#8208;programmed cell death protein ligand 1 (aPDL1) to enable efficient transmucosal delivery, which is promising for immunotherapy against lung metastasis without the concern of systemic toxicity.








Abstract
Despite the critical breakthrough achieved by immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), the clinical benefits are usually restricted by inefficient infiltration of immune cells and immune&#8208;associated adverse effects. Noninvasive aerosol inhalation, as a definitive procedure for treatment of respiratory diseases, for ICB immunotherapy against lung metastasis, has not been realized to the best knowledge. Herein, an inhaled immunotherapeutic chitosan (CS)&#8211;antibody complex is developed for immunotherapy against lung cancer. In this system, CS is used as a carrier to assemble with anti&#8208;programmed cell death protein ligand 1 (aPD&#8208;L1) to enable efficient transmucosal delivery. Moreover, CS exhibits adjuvant effects to drive potent immune responses via activating the cyclic&#8208;di&#8208;GMP&#8208;AMP synthase (cGAS)&#8208;stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway. Interestingly, repeated inhalation of CS/aPD&#8208;L1 complex can effectively activate the immune system by promoting the infiltration of different immune cells especially CD8+ T cells around tumor lesions, and finally prolongs the survival of mice to 60 days. Thus, the work presents a unique aerosol inhalation delivery system for ICB antibody, which is promising for immunotherapy against lung metastasis without the concern of systemic toxicity.

         <title>Simultaneous Incorporation of Two Types of Azo&#8208;Groups in the Side Chains of a Conjugated D&#8211;A Polymer for Logic Control of the Semiconducting Performance by Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conjugated D&#8211;A polymers with two types of azo groups, for which trans&#8211;cis isomerization can sequentially occur with light irradiation at different wavelengths, in the side chains possess tri&#8208;stable semiconducting states. As a consequence, the performance of the resulting field&#8208;effect transistors can be logically controlled by light irradiation at three different wavelengths, mimicking three&#8208;value logic gates.








Abstract
A new design strategy for photoresponsive semiconducting polymer with tri&#8208;stable semiconducting states is reported by simultaneous incorporation of tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;methoxy&#8208;substituted azobenzene (mAzo) and arylazopyrazole (pAzo) in the side chains. The trans&#8208;to&#8208;cis transformations for mAzo and pAzo groups can sequentially occur within the polymer thin film after sequential 560 and 365&#160;nm light irradiation. Remarkably, the trans&#8211;cis isomerization of mAzo and pAzo groups can modulate the thin film crystallinity. Accordingly, the performances of the resulting field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) can be reversibly modulated, leading to tri&#8208;stable semiconducting states after sequential 560, 365, and 470&#160;nm light irradiation. Therefore, the device performance can be logically controlled by light irradiation at three different wavelengths. In addition, with light irradiation and device current as the input and output signals, the three&#8208;value logic gate by using single FET device can be successfully mimicked.

         <title>Shape&#8208;Memory Metallopolymers Based on Two Orthogonal Metal&#8211;Ligand Interactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and characterization of shape&#8208;memory metallopolymers based on orthogonal supramolecular interactions are presented; i.e., two different metal complexes. By a cyclo mechanic test, the structure&#8211;property relationship is studied, and a strong correlation between the switching temperature, which ranges in this case from 85 to 115&#160;&#176;C, and the structural parameters is achieved.








Abstract
A new shape&#8208;memory polymer is presented, in which both the stable phase as well as the switching unit consist of two different metal complexes. Suitable metal ions, which simultaneously form labile complexes with histidine and stable ones with terpyridine ligands, are identified via isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements. Different copolymers are synthesized, which contain butyl methacrylate as the main monomer and the metal&#8208;binding ligands in the side chains. Zn(TFMS)2 and NiCl2 are utilized for the dual crosslinking, resulting in the formation of metallopolymer networks. The switching temperature can simply be tuned by changing the composition as well as by the choice of the metal ion. Strain fixity rates (about 99%) and very high strain recovery rates (up to 95%) are achieved and the mechanism is revealed using different techniques such as Raman spectroscopy.

         <title>Liquid Crystal Elastomer&#8208;Based Magnetic Composite Films for Reconfigurable Shape&#8208;Morphing Soft Miniature Machines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A liquid crystal elastomer material with embedded ferromagnetic microparticles takes advantage of both magnetic and thermal stimuli&#8208;responsiveness. Such monolithic soft material enables reconfigurable magnetic soft miniature machines that self&#8208;adapt to changing environmental conditions. The hybrid material introduces a multi&#8208;modal actuation and physical intelligence capability for wireless soft machines.








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive and active materials promise radical advances for many applications. In particular, soft magnetic materials offer precise, fast, and wireless actuation together with versatile functionality, while liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are capable of large reversible and programmable shape&#8208;morphing with high work densities in response to various environmental stimuli, e.g., temperature, light, and chemical solutions. Integrating the orthogonal stimuli&#8208;responsiveness of these two kinds of active materials could potentially enable new functionalities and future applications. Here, magnetic microparticles (MMPs) are embedded into an LCE film to take the respective advantages of both materials without compromising their independent stimuli&#8208;responsiveness. This composite material enables reconfigurable magnetic soft miniature machines that can self&#8208;adapt to a changing environment. In particular, a miniature soft robot that can autonomously alter its locomotion mode when it moves from air to hot liquid, a vine&#8208;like filament that can sense and twine around a support, and a light&#8208;switchable magnetic spring are demonstrated. The integration of LCEs and MMPs into monolithic structures introduces a new dimension in the design of soft machines and thus greatly enhances their use in applications in complex environments, especially for miniature soft robots, which are self&#8208;adaptable to environmental changes while being remotely controllable.

         <title>A Patternable and In Situ Formed Polymeric Zinc Blanket for a Reversible Zinc Anode in a Skin&#8208;Mountable Microbattery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A zinc blanket created by the coordination between carbonyl oxygen atoms in a polyimide coating and zinc ions overcomes the thermodynamic instability and facilitates plating/stripping kinetics. Patterning this zinc blanket for a Zn microanode allows for the development of a skin&#8208;mountable microbattery with an outstanding rate capability and stable cycling performance, providing promise for microbatteries integrable for electronic skin.








Abstract
Owing to their high safety and reversibility, aqueous microbatteries using zinc anodes and an acid electrolyte have emerged as promising candidates for wearable electronics. However, a critical limitation that prevents implementing zinc chemistry at the microscale lies in its spontaneous corrosion in an acidic electrolyte that causes a capacity loss of 40% after a ten&#8208;hour rest. Widespread anti&#8208;corrosion techniques, such as polymer coating, often retard the kinetics of zinc plating/stripping and lack spatial control at the microscale. Here, a polyimide coating that resolves this dilemma is reported. The coating prevents corrosion and hence reduces the capacity loss of a standby microbattery to 10%. The coordination of carbonyl oxygen in the polyimide with zinc ions builds up over cycling, creating a zinc blanket that minimizes the concentration gradient through the electrode/electrolyte interface and thus allows for fast kinetics and low plating/stripping overpotential. The polyimide's patternable feature energizes microbatteries in both aqueous and hydrogel electrolytes, delivering a supercapacitor&#8208;level rate performance and 400 stable cycles in the hydrogel electrolyte. Moreover, the microbattery is able to be attached to human skin and offers strong resistance to deformations, splashing, and external shock. The skin&#8208;mountable microbattery demonstrates an excellent combination of anti&#8208;corrosion, reversibility, and durability in wearables.

         <title>Phenylene&#8208;Bridged Bispyridinium with High Capacity and Stability for Aqueous Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;regulated conjugation strategy is proposed to engineer viologen for flow batteries. In the oxidized state, the conjugation is &#8220;off&#8221; and the two pyridinium rings behave independently, yielding concomitant transfer of two electrons and one voltage plateau. In the reduced state, the conjugation is &#8220;on&#8221; and the charge can be effectively delocalized, lowering the Lewis basicity and improving the cycling stability of the battery.








Abstract
A rotating phenyl ring is introduced between the two pyridinium rings, namely, 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bis[3&#8208;(trimethylamonium)propyl]&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;(1,4&#8208;phenylene)bispyridinium tetrachloride ((APBPy)Cl4), to form a switchable conjugation. In this design, the conjugation is switched &#8220;off&#8221; in the oxidized state and the two pyridinium rings behave independently during the redox process, yielding a concomitant transfer of two electrons at the same potential and, thus, simplifying the battery management. The conjugation is switched &#8220;on&#8221; in the reduced state and the charge can be effectively delocalized, lowering the Lewis basicity and improving its chemical stability. By pairing 0.50 m (APBPy)Cl4 with a 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;yl oxyl derivative as the positive electrolyte, a flow battery delivers a high standard cell voltage of 1.730&#160;V and a high specific capacity of 20.0 Ah L&#8211;1. The battery also shows an exceptionally high energy efficiency of 80.8% and a superior cycling stability at 80&#160;mA cm&#8211;2. This strategy proves itself a great success in engineering viologen as a two&#8208;electron storage mediator with high capacity and stability.

         <title>Surface Plasmon&#8208;Enhanced Short&#8208;Wave Infrared Fluorescence for Detecting Sub&#8208;Millimeter&#8208;Sized Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surface plasmon&#8208;enhanced short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) fluorescent probe with high brightness is developed. Both the actively and passively targeted imaging probes can locate tumors in vivo with similar intratumor distributions in an SKOV&#8208;3 ovarian cancer model. In addition, these SWIR imaging probes are able to detect sub&#8208;millimeter&#8208;sized tumor nodules, making them excellent candidates for fluorescence imaging&#8208;guided surgery.








Abstract
Short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR, 900&#8211;1700&#160;nm) enables in vivo imaging with high spatiotemporal resolution and penetration depth due to the reduced tissue autofluorescence and decreased photon scattering at long wavelengths. Although small organic SWIR dye molecules have excellent biocompatibility, they have been rarely exploited as compared to their inorganic counterparts, mainly due to their low quantum yield. To increase their brightness, in this work, the SWIR dye molecules are placed in close proximity to gold nanorods (AuNRs) for surface plasmon&#8208;enhanced emission. The fluorescence enhancement is optimized by controlling the dye&#8208;to&#8208;AuNR number ratio and up to &#8776;45&#8208;fold enhancement factor is achieved. In addition, the results indicate that the highest dye&#8208;to&#8208;AuNR number ratio gives the highest emission intensity per weight and this is used for synthesizing SWIR imaging probes using layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) technique with polymer coating protection. Then, the SWIR imaging probes are applied for in vivo imaging of ovarian cancer and the surface coating effect on intratumor distribution of the imaging probes is investigated in two orthotopic ovarian cancer models. Lastly, it is demonstrated that the plasmon&#8208;enhanced SWIR imaging probe has great potential for fluorescence imaging&#8208;guided surgery by showing its capability to detect sub&#8208;millimeter&#8208;sized tumors.

         <title>Hidden Vacancy Benefit in Monolayer 2D Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unusual benefit of vacancies in monolayer 2D semiconductors is enhancing their charge transport properties of a nearest&#8208;neighbor hopping conduction mechanism, to push the performance limit of atomically thin transistors with record&#8208;setting performance metrics.








Abstract
Monolayer 2D semiconductors (e.g., MoS2) are of considerable interest for atomically thin transistors but generally limited by insufficient carrier mobility or driving current. Minimizing the lattice defects in 2D semiconductors represents a common strategy to improve their electronic properties, but has met with limited success to date. Herein, a hidden benefit of the atomic vacancies in monolayer 2D semiconductors to push their performance limit is reported. By purposely tailoring the sulfur vacancies (SVs) to an optimum density of 4.7% in monolayer MoS2, an unusual mobility enhancement is obtained and a record&#8208;high carrier mobility (&gt;115 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) is achieved, realizing monolayer MoS2 transistors with an exceptional current density (&gt;0.60&#160;mA &#181;m&#8722;1) and a record&#8208;high on/off ratio &gt;1010,&#160;and enabling a logic inverter with an ultrahigh voltage gain &gt;100.&#160;The systematic transport studies reveal that the counterintuitive vacancy&#8208;enhanced transport originates from a nearest&#8208;neighbor hopping conduction model, in which an optimum SV density is essential for maximizing the charge hopping probability. Lastly, the vacancy benefit into other monolayer 2D semiconductors is further generalized; thus, a general strategy for tailoring the charge transport properties of monolayer materials is defined.

By purposely tailoring the sulfur vacancies (SVs) to an optimum density of 4.7% in monolayer MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, an unusual mobility enhancement is obtained and a record&#8208;high carrier mobility (&amp;gt;115 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) is achieved, realizing monolayer MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; transistors with an exceptional current density (&amp;gt;0.60&#160;mA &#181;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and a record&#8208;high on/off ratio &amp;gt;10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;,&#160;and enabling a logic inverter with an ultrahigh voltage gain &amp;gt;100.&#160;The systematic transport studies reveal that the counterintuitive vacancy&#8208;enhanced transport originates from a nearest&#8208;neighbor hopping conduction model, in which an optimum SV density is essential for maximizing the charge hopping probability. Lastly, the vacancy benefit into other monolayer 2D semiconductors is further generalized; thus, a general strategy for tailoring the charge transport properties of monolayer materials is defined.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Associated Macrophage and Tumor&#8208;Cell Dually Transfecting Polyplexes for Efficient Interleukin&#8208;12 Cancer Gene Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 2, January 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intravenously administered polymeric interleukin&#8208;12 (IL12) gene&#8208;delivery vector transfects both tumor cells and macrophages to efficiently produce IL12 inside the tumor, which activates anticancer immune responses and the tumor microenvironment, leading to retarded tumor growth and prolonged animals&#8217; survival with negligible systemic toxicities. This work demonstrates the first nonviral IL12 gene delivery making use of both macrophages and tumor cells.








Abstract
Interleukin 12 (IL12) is a potent pro&#8208;inflammatory chemokine with multifunction, including promoting cytotoxic T&#8208;cell&#8208;mediated killing of cancer cells. IL12&#8208;based cancer gene therapy can overcome IL12's life&#8208;threatening adverse effects, but its clinical translation has been limited by the lack of systemic gene&#8208;delivery vectors capable of efficiently transfecting tumors to produce sufficient local IL12. Macrophages inherently excrete IL12, and tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) are the major tumor component taking up a large fraction of the vectors arriving in the tumor. It is thus hypothesized that a gene vector efficiently transfecting both cancer cells and TAMs would make the tumor to produce sufficient IL12; however, gene transfection of TAMs is challenging due to their inherent strong degradation ability. Herein, an IL12 gene&#8208;delivery vector is designed that efficiently transfects both cancer cells and TAMs to make them as a factory for IL12 production, which efficiently activates anticancer immune responses and remodels the tumor microenvironment, for instance, increasing the M1/M2 ratio by more than fourfold. Therefore, the intravenously administered vector retards tumor growth and doubles survival in three animal models&#8217; with negligible systemic toxicities. This work reports the first nonviral IL12 gene delivery system that effectively makes use of both macrophages and tumor cells.

         <title>Heavy&#8208;Atom&#8208;Modulated Supramolecular Assembly Increases Antitumor Potency against Malignant Breast Tumors via Tunable Cooperativity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 2, January 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembled multi&#8208;iodinated boron dipyrromethene micelles (IBMs), via the interplay of both &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and hydrophobic interactions, are reported. These IBMs cause efficient cascade delivery into cytoplasm and tunable photoconversion for yielding potent antitumor synergy against triple&#8208;negative breast cancer together with distinctly reduced recurrence and metastasis through the reversal of tumor immunosuppression.








Abstract
Triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains with highest incidence and mortality rates among females, and a critical bottleneck lies in rationally establishing potent therapeutics against TNBC. Here, the self&#8208;assembled micellar nanoarchitecture of heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;modulated supramolecules with efficient cytoplasmic translocation and tunable photoconversion is shown, for potent suppression against primary, metastatic, and recurrent TNBC. Multi&#8208;iodinated boron dipyrromethene micelles yield tunable photoconversion into singlet oxygen and a thermal effect, together with deep penetration and subsequent cytoplasmic translocation at the tumor. Tetra&#8208;iodinated boron dipyrromethene micelles (4&#8208;IBMs) particularly show a distinctly enhanced cooperativity of antitumor efficiency through considerable expressions of apoptotic proteins, potently suppressing subcutaneous, and orthotopic TNBC models, together with reduced oxygen dependence. Furthermore, 4&#8208;IBMs yield preferable anti&#8208;metastatic and anti&#8208;recurrent efficacies through the inhibition of metastasis&#8208;relevant proteins, distinct immunogenic cell death, and re&#8208;education of M2 macrophages into tumoricidal M1 phenotype as compared to chemotherapy and surgical resection. These results offer insights into the cooperativity of supramolecular nanoarchitectures for potent phototherapy against TNBC.

         <title>An Ultrahigh&#8208;Field&#8208;Tailored T1&#8211;T2 Dual&#8208;Mode MRI Contrast Agent for High&#8208;Performance Vascular Imaging</title>

         <dc:description>
An ultrahigh magnetic field (UHF)&#8208;tailored T1&#8211;T2 dual&#8208;mode iron oxide nanoparticle&#8208;based contrast agent (UDIOC) with a near&#8208;paramagnetic core and ultracompact hydrophilic surface modification is developed, which exhibits a dually enhanced T1&#8211;T2 contrast effect under UHF. By virtue of high&#8208;resolution UHF magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and a simple double&#8208;checking process, UDIOC&#8208;based dual&#8208;mode imaging enables the assessment of the vascular anatomy and functions with high sensitivity and accuracy.








Abstract
The assessment of vascular anatomy and functions using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is critical for medical diagnosis, whereas the commonly used low&#8208;field MRI system (&#8804;3 T) suffers from low spatial resolution. Ultrahigh field (UHF) MRI (&#8805;7 T), with significantly improved resolution and signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio, shows great potential to provide high&#8208;resolution vasculature images. However, practical applications of UHF MRI technology for vascular imaging are currently limited by the low sensitivity and accuracy of single&#8208;mode (T1 or T2) contrast agents. Herein, a UHF&#8208;tailored T1&#8211;T2 dual&#8208;mode iron oxide nanoparticle&#8208;based contrast agent (UDIOC) with extremely small core size and ultracompact hydrophilic surface modification, exhibiting dually enhanced T1&#8211;T2 contrast effect under the 7 T magnetic field, is reported. The UDIOC enables clear visualization of microvasculature as small as &#8776;140&#160;&#181;m in diameter under UHF MRI, extending the detection limit of the 7 T MR angiography. Moreover, by virtue of high&#8208;resolution UHF MRI and a simple double&#8208;checking process, UDIOC&#8208;based dual&#8208;mode dynamic contrast&#8208;enhanced MRI is successfully applied to detect tumor vascular permeability with extremely high sensitivity and accuracy, providing a novel paradigm for the precise medical diagnosis of vascular&#8208;related diseases.

         <dc:description>
A straightforward polyTPD passivation is introduced to reduce the defect&#8208;mediated recombination by elucidating the imperfections on the surface and grain boundaries of perovskite materials. Suppressed non&#8208;radiative recombination and improved interfacial hole extraction result in perovskite solar cells with stabilized efficiency exceeding 21%. Moreover, ultra&#8208;hydrophobic and thermally robust polyTPD passivated devices retain 94% of the initial efficiency after 800 h under operational conditions.








Abstract
The failure of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) to maintain their maximum efficiency over a prolonged time is due to the deterioration of the light harvesting material under environmental factors such as humidity, heat, and light. Systematically elucidating and eliminating such degradation pathways are critical to imminent commercial use of this technology. Here, a straightforward approach is introduced to reduce the level of defect&#8208;states present at the perovskite and hole transporting layer interface by treating the various perovskite surfaces with poly(N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis&#8208;4&#8208;butylphenyl&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;bisphenyl)benzidine (polyTPD) molecules. This strategy significantly suppresses the defect&#8208;mediated non&#8208;radiative recombination in the ensuing devices and prevents the penetration of degrading agents into the inner layers by passivating the perovskite surface and grain boundaries. Suppressed non&#8208;radiative recombination and improved interfacial hole extraction result in PSCs with stabilized efficiency exceeding 21% with negligible hysteresis (&#8776;19.1% for control device). Moreover, ultra&#8208;hydrophobic polyTPD passivant considerably alleviates moisture penetration, showing &#8776;91% retention of initial efficiencies after 300 h storage at high relative humidity of 80%. Similarly, passivated device retains 94% of its initial efficiency after 800 h under operational conditions (maximum power point tracking under continuous illumination at 60&#160;&#176;C). In addition to interfacial passivation function, hole&#8208;selective role of dopant&#8208;free polyTPD is also evaluated and discussed in this study.

Suppressed non&#8208;radiative recombination and improved interfacial hole extraction result in perovskite solar cells with stabilized efficiency exceeding 21%. Moreover, ultra&#8208;hydrophobic and thermally robust polyTPD passivated devices retain 94% of the initial efficiency after 800 h under operational conditions.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The failure of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) to maintain their maximum efficiency over a prolonged time is due to the deterioration of the light harvesting material under environmental factors such as humidity, heat, and light. Systematically elucidating and eliminating such degradation pathways are critical to imminent commercial use of this technology. Here, a straightforward approach is introduced to reduce the level of defect&#8208;states present at the perovskite and hole transporting layer interface by treating the various perovskite surfaces with poly(&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8242;&#8208;bis&#8208;4&#8208;butylphenyl&#8208;&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8242;&#8208;bisphenyl)benzidine (polyTPD) molecules. This strategy significantly suppresses the defect&#8208;mediated non&#8208;radiative recombination in the ensuing devices and prevents the penetration of degrading agents into the inner layers by passivating the perovskite surface and grain boundaries. Suppressed non&#8208;radiative recombination and improved interfacial hole extraction result in PSCs with stabilized efficiency exceeding 21% with negligible hysteresis (&#8776;19.1% for control device). Moreover, ultra&#8208;hydrophobic polyTPD passivant considerably alleviates moisture penetration, showing &#8776;91% retention of initial efficiencies after 300 h storage at high relative humidity of 80%. Similarly, passivated device retains 94% of its initial efficiency after 800 h under operational conditions (maximum power point tracking under continuous illumination at 60&#160;&#176;C). In addition to interfacial passivation function, hole&#8208;selective role of dopant&#8208;free polyTPD is also evaluated and discussed in this study.&lt;/p&gt;

Abstract
The development of solid&#8208;state intelligent materials, in particular those showing photoresponsive luminescence (PRL), is highly desirable for their cutting&#8208;edge applications in sensors, displays, data&#8208;storage, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting, but is challenging. Few PRL materials are constructed by tethering the classic photochromic systems with newly&#8208;emerged solid&#8208;state emitters. Selective solid&#8208;state photoreactions are demanded to precisely manipulate the luminescent behavior of these emitters, which require dramatic structural change and enough free space, thus limiting the scope of the PRL family. Here, a new PRL material, TPE&#8208;4N, that features sensitive and reversible fluorescence switching is reported. The interesting on&#8211;off luminescent property of TPE&#8208;4N can be facilely tuned through fast phototriggering and thermal annealing. Experimental and theoretical investigations reveal that subtle molecular conformation variation induces the corresponding PRL behavior. The crystalline and amorphous state endows an efficient and weak ISC process, respectively, to turn on and off the emission. The readily fabricated thin&#8208;film of TPE&#8208;4N exhibits non&#8208;destructive PRL behavior with high contrast (&gt;102), good light transmittance (&gt;72.3%), and great durability and reversibility under room light for months. Remarkably, a uniform thin&#8208;film with such fascinating PRL properties allows high&#8208;tech applications in invisible anti&#8208;counterfeiting and dynamic optical data storage with micro&#8208;resolution.

         <title>Elucidation of the Synergistic Effect of Dopants and Vacancies on Promoted Selectivity for CO2 Electroreduction to Formate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 2, January 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel SnO2 nanosheet catalyst presents a possible synergistic effect of N dopants and oxygen vacancies on the activity and selectivity for CO2 electroreduction to formate. Low&#8208;coordination Sn&#8211;N moieties with optimal N dopants and O vacancies are identified as active sites with intrinsically enhanced activity.








Abstract
Sn&#8208;based materials are identified as promising catalysts for the CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR) to formate (HCOO&#8722;). However, their insufficient selectivity and activity remain grand challenges. A new type of SnO2 nanosheet with simultaneous N dopants and oxygen vacancies (VO&#8208;rich N&#8208;SnO2 NS) for promoting CO2 conversion to HCOO&#8722; is reported. Due to the likely synergistic effect of N dopant and VO, the VO&#8208;rich N&#8208;SnO2 NS exhibits high catalytic selectivity featured by an HCOO&#8722; Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 83% at &#8722;0.9 V and an FE of &gt; 90% for all C1 products (HCOO&#8722; and CO) at a wide potential range from &#8722;0.9 to &#8722;1.2 V. Low coordination Sn&#8211;N moieties are the active sites with optimal electronic and geometric structures regulated by VO and N dopants. Theoretical calculations elucidate that the reaction free energy of HCOO* protonation is decreased on the VO&#8208;rich N&#8208;SnO2 NS, thus enhancing HCOO&#8722; selectivity. The weakened H* adsorption energy also inhibits the hydrogen evolution reaction, a dominant side reaction during the CO2RR. Furthermore, using the catalyst as the cathode, a spontaneous Galvanic Zn&#8208;CO2 cell and a solar&#8208;powered electrolysis process successfully demonstrated the efficient HCOO&#8722; generation through CO2 conversion and storage.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Mediated High Conductivity in Ultrathin Antiferromagnetic Metallic Nitrides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 2, January 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electronic state transitions in highly crystalline antiferromagnetic CrN films are mediated with strain and reduced dimensionality. Surprisingly, the CrN layer is still highly conductive when its thickness shrinks to 1&#8208;unit&#8208;cell, which is far below the critical thickness of most metallic films. The ability to achieve highly conductive nitride ultrathin films can be used for utilizing their exceptional characteristics.








Abstract
Strain engineering provides the ability to control the ground states and associated phase transition in epitaxial films. However, the systematic study of the intrinsic character and strain dependency in transition&#8208;metal nitrides remains challenging due to the difficulty in fabricating stoichiometric and high&#8208;quality films. Here the observation of an electronic state transition in highly crystalline antiferromagnetic CrN films with strain and reduced dimensionality is reported. By shrinking the film thickness to a critical value of &#8776;30 unit cells, a profound conductivity reduction accompanied by unexpected volume expansion is observed in CrN films. The electrical conductivity is observed surprisingly when the CrN layer is as thin as a single unit cell thick, which is far below the critical thickness of most metallic films. It is found that the metallicity of an ultrathin CrN film recovers from insulating behavior upon the removal of the as&#8208;grown strain by the fabrication of freestanding nitride films. Both first&#8208;principles calculations and linear dichroism measurements reveal that the strain&#8208;mediated orbital splitting effectively customizes the relatively small bandgap at the Fermi level, leading to an exotic phase transition in CrN. The ability to achieve highly conductive nitride ultrathin films by harnessing strain&#8208;control over competing phases can be used for utilizing their exceptional characteristics.

         <title>Mutually Reinforced Polymer&#8211;Graphene Bilayer Membranes for Energy&#8208;Efficient Acoustic Transduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 2, January 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
To fabricate ultrahigh&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio, lightweight, and transparent conductive membranes, single&#8208;layer graphene is reinforced by high&#8208;performance polyetherimide to form a laminate bilayer. The bilayer is exceptionally strong, lightweight, transparent, and conductive and has a record&#8208;high aspect ratio of 1 &#215; 105. As an acoustic transducer in a prototype electrostatic speaker, the bilayer consumes 100 times less energy than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrodynamic speakers.








Abstract
Graphene holds promise for thin, ultralightweight, and high&#8208;performance nanoelectromechanical transducers. However, graphene&#8208;only devices are limited in size due to fatigue and fracture of suspended graphene membranes. Here, a lightweight, flexible, transparent, and conductive bilayer composite of polyetherimide and single&#8208;layer graphene is prepared and suspended on the centimeter scale with an unprecedentedly high aspect ratio of 105. The coupling of the two components leads to mutual reinforcement and creates an ultrastrong membrane that supports 30&#160;000 times its own weight. Upon electromechanical actuation, the membrane pushes a massive amount of air and generates high&#8208;quality acoustic sound. The energy efficiency is &#8776;10&#8211;100&#160;times better than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrodynamic speakers.

&lt;p&gt;To fabricate ultrahigh&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio, lightweight, and transparent conductive membranes, single&#8208;layer graphene is reinforced by high&#8208;performance polyetherimide to form a laminate bilayer. The bilayer is exceptionally strong, lightweight, transparent, and conductive and has a record&#8208;high aspect ratio of 1 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;. As an acoustic transducer in a prototype electrostatic speaker, the bilayer consumes 100 times less energy than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrodynamic speakers.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graphene holds promise for thin, ultralightweight, and high&#8208;performance nanoelectromechanical transducers. However, graphene&#8208;only devices are limited in size due to fatigue and fracture of suspended graphene membranes. Here, a lightweight, flexible, transparent, and conductive bilayer composite of polyetherimide and single&#8208;layer graphene is prepared and suspended on the centimeter scale with an unprecedentedly high aspect ratio of 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;. The coupling of the two components leads to mutual reinforcement and creates an ultrastrong membrane that supports 30&#160;000 times its own weight. Upon electromechanical actuation, the membrane pushes a massive amount of air and generates high&#8208;quality acoustic sound. The energy efficiency is &lt;b&gt;&#8776;&lt;/b&gt;10&#8211;100&#160;times better than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrodynamic speakers. The bilayer membrane's combined properties of electrical conductivity, mechanical strength, optical transparency, thermal stability, and chemical resistance will promote applications in electronics, mechanics, and optics.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Performance Limits of an Alternating Current Electroluminescent Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 2, January 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electroluminescence can be achieved from nearly any emissive material with a single, generic device structure that uses alternating current voltage and a carbon nanotube contact. Performance limits of the device are studied through device modeling and experiments, demonstrating how low voltage and efficient electroluminescence can be achieved with emissive materials possessing a wide range of electrical and physical properties.








Abstract
The use of an alternating current (AC) voltage is a simple, versatile method of producing electroluminescence from generic emissive materials without the need for contact engineering. Recently, it was shown that AC&#8208;driven, capacitive electroluminescent devices with carbon nanotube network contacts can be used to generate and study electroluminescence from a variety of molecular materials emitting in the infrared&#8208;to&#8208;ultraviolet range. Here, performance trade&#8208;offs in these devices are studied through comprehensive device simulations and illustrative experiments, enhancing understanding of the mechanism and capability of electroluminescent devices based on alternating as opposed to direct current (DC) schemes. AC&#8208;driven electroluminescent devices can overcome several limitations of conventional DC&#8208;driven electroluminescent devices, including the requirement for proper alignment of material energy levels and the need to process emitting materials into uniform thin films. By simultaneously optimizing device geometry, driving parameters, and material characteristics, the performance of these devices can be tuned. Importantly, the turn&#8208;on voltage of AC&#8208;driven electroluminescent devices approaches the bandgap of the emitting material as the gate oxide thickness is scaled, and internally efficient electroluminescence can be achieved using low&#8208;mobility single&#8208;layer emitter films with varying thicknesses and energy barrier heights relative to the contact.

         <title>Persistent Conjugated Backbone and Disordered Lamellar Packing Impart Polymers with Efficient n&#8208;Doping and High Conductivities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 2, January 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two conjugated polymers with rigid planar backbones, but with disordered crystalline structures, exhibit surprising structural tolerance to commonly used n&#8208;dopants. These properties allow both high concentrations and high mobility of the charge carriers to be realized simultaneously in n&#8208;doped polymers, resulting in excellent electrical conductivity of over 90 S cm&#8722;1 and thermoelectric performance up to 106 &#181;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processable highly conductive polymers are of great interest in emerging electronic applications. For p&#8208;doped polymers, conductivities as high a nearly 105 S cm&#8722;1 have been reported. In the case of n&#8208;doped polymers, they often fall well short of the high values noted above, which might be achievable, if much higher charge&#8208;carrier mobilities determined could be realized in combination with high charge&#8208;carrier densities. This is in part due to inefficient doping and dopant ions disturbing the ordering of polymers, limiting efficient charge transport and ultimately the achievable conductivities. Here, n&#8208;doped polymers that achieve a high conductivity of more than 90 S cm&#8722;1 by a simple solution&#8208;based co&#8208;deposition method are reported. Two conjugated polymers with rigid planar backbones, but with disordered crystalline structures, exhibit surprising structural tolerance to, and excellent miscibility with, commonly used n&#8208;dopants. These properties allow both high concentrations and high mobility of the charge carriers to be realized simultaneously in n&#8208;doped polymers, resulting in excellent electrical conductivity and thermoelectric performance.

         <title>Hybrid Solid Electrolyte Interphases Enabled Ultralong Life Ca&#8208;Metal Batteries Working at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 2, January 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable Ca plating/stripping process for more than 1000 h is realized through a Na/Ca hybrid SEI strategy. This enables an ultralong life and high operation voltage, up to 4.5 V, for room&#8208;temperature Ca&#8208;metal batteries.








Abstract
Currently, the application of calcium metal anodes is challenged by rapidly degenerated plating/stripping electrochemistry without suitable solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs) capable of fast Ca2+ transport kinetics and superior ability to resist anion oxidation. Here, through in situ evolved Na/Ca hybrid SEIs, symmetrical Ca//Ca batteries readily remain stable for more than 1000 h deposition&#8211;dissolution cycles (versus less than 60 h for those with pure Ca SEIs under the same condition). Coupled with a specially designed freestanding lattice&#8208;expanded graphitic carbon fiber membrane and tailored operation voltages, the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept Ca&#8208;metal batteries reversibly run for almost 1900 cycles with &#8776;83% capacity retention and a high average discharge voltage of 3.16&#160;V. The good performance not only benefits from the stable SEIs at the Ca metal surface which affords free Ca2+ transports and prohibits out&#8208;of&#8208;control fluridation of Ca (forming CaF2 ion&#8208;/electron&#8208;insulating layer) but is also attributed to reversible relay insertion/extraction electrochemistry in the cathode. This work sheds new light on durable metal battery technology.

         <title>Operando Tailoring of Defects and Strains in Corrugated &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2 Nanosheets for Stable and High&#8208;Rate Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 2, January 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Corrugated &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2, with outstanding activity and stability for hybrid supercapacitors, is developed through an electrochemical abuse strategy. The operando X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure technique and finite&#8208;element analysis demonstrate that the in&#8208;situ&#8208;tailored lattice defects and the strain&#8208;induced highly curved micromorphology play critical roles in enhancing chemical activity and structural robustness.








Abstract
Nickel hydroxide represents a technologically important material for energy storage, such as hybrid supercapacitors. It has two different crystallographic polymorphs, &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2, showing advantages in either theoretical capacity or cycling/rate performance, manifesting a trade&#8208;off trend that needs to be optimized for practical applications. Here, the synergistic superiorities in both activity and stability of corrugated &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2 nanosheets are demonstrated through an electrochemical abuse approach. With &#8776;91% capacity retention after 10&#160;000 cycles, the corrugated &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2 nanosheets can deliver a gravimetric capacity of 457 C g&#8722;1 at a high current density of 30 A g&#8722;1, which is nearly two and four times that of the regular &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2, respectively. Operando spectroscopy and finite element analysis reveal that greatly enhanced chemical activity and structural robustness can be attributed to the in situ tailored lattice defects and the strain&#8208;induced highly curved micromorphology. This work demonstrates a multi&#8208;scale defect&#8208;and&#8208;strain co&#8208;design strategy, which is helpful for rational design and tuned fabrication of next&#8208;generation electrode materials for stable and high&#8208;rate energy storage.

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Flowing Graphene Chip&#8208;Based High&#8208;Resolution Electron Microscopy</title>

The liquid&#8208;flowing graphene chip (LFGC) is a novel imaging platform enabling the atomic&#8208;scale observation of liquid&#8208;phase reactions during in operando circumstances. Graphene viewing windows and anti&#8208;bulging SiNx supports provide a controllable liquid thickness and structural integrity under harsh experimental conditions. Using LFGC, both atomic&#8208;resolution imaging and molecular&#8208;level information for inorganic and biological samples can be acquired under liquid circulation.








Abstract
The recent advances in liquid&#8208;phase transmission electron microscopy represent tremendous potential in many different fields and exciting new opportunities. However, achieving both high&#8208;resolution imaging and operando capabilities remain a significant challenge. This work suggests a novel in situ imaging platform of liquid&#8208;flowing graphene chip TEM (LFGC&#8208;TEM) equipped with graphene viewing windows and a liquid exchange system. The LFGCs are robust under high&#8208;pressure gradients and rapid liquid circulation in ranges covering the experimental conditions accessible with conventional thick SiNx chips. LFGC&#8208;TEM provides atomic resolution for colloidal nanoparticles and molecular&#8208;level information limits for unstained wet biomolecules and cells that are comparable to the resolutions achievable with solid&#8208;phase and cryogenic TEM, respectively. This imaging platform can provide an opportunity for live imaging of biological phenomena that is not yet achieved using any current methods.

         <title>Nanoscale&#8208;Confined Terahertz Polaritons in a van der Waals Crystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 2, January 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extreme confinement of long&#8208;wavelength terahertz radiation to nanoscale dimensions is achieved in the natural hyperbolic van der Waals crystal &#945;&#8208;MoO3. A range of highly anisotropic, in&#8208;plane THz polaritonic excitations are directly visualized in the 8&#8211;12 THz spectral range, exhibiting ultralow&#8208;loss propagation, tunable THz response, and orthogonal propagation directions.








Abstract
Electromagnetic field confinement is crucial for nanophotonic technologies, since it allows for enhancing light&#8211;matter interactions, thus enabling light manipulation in deep sub&#8208;wavelength scales. In the terahertz (THz) spectral range, radiation confinement is conventionally achieved with specially designed metallic structures&#8212;such as antennas or nanoslits&#8212;with large footprints due to the rather long wavelengths of THz radiation. In this context, phonon polaritons&#8212;light coupled to lattice vibrations&#8212;in van der Waals (vdW) crystals have emerged as a promising solution for controlling light beyond the diffraction limit, as they feature extreme field confinements and low optical losses. However, experimental demonstration of nanoscale&#8208;confined phonon polaritons at THz frequencies has so far remained elusive. Here, it is provided by employing scattering&#8208;type scanning near&#8208;field optical microscopy combined with a free&#8208;electron laser to reveal a range of low&#8208;loss polaritonic excitations at frequencies from 8 to 12 THz in the vdW semiconductor &#945;&#8208;MoO3. In this study, THz polaritons are visualized with: i) in&#8208;plane hyperbolic dispersion, ii) extreme nanoscale field confinement (below &#955;o&#160;&#8260;75), and iii) long polariton lifetimes, with a lower limit of &gt;2&#160;ps.

         <title>Observation of Standing Spin Waves in a van der Waals Magnetic Material</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 2, January 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Standing spin&#8208;wave modes are reported in a van der Waals magnetic material. These modes travel along the CrCl3 sample thickness of 20 mm and are reflected at the boundaries. These spin waves can be useful for creating tunable van der Waals magnonic devices operating at GHz frequencies.








Abstract
Spin waves are studied for data storage, communication, and logic circuits in the field of spintronics based on their potential to substitute electrons. The recent discovery of magnetism in 2D systems such as monolayer CrI3 and Cr2Ge2Te6 has led to a renewed interest in such applications of magnetism in the 2D limit. Here, direct evidence of standing spin waves is presented along with the uniform precessional resonance modes in the van der Waals magnetic material, CrCl3. This is the first direct observation of standing spin&#8208;wave modes, set up along a thickness of 20&#160;mm, in a van der Waals material. Standing spin waves are detected in the vicinity of both branches, optical and acoustic, of the antiferromagnetic resonance. Magnon&#8211;magnon coupling and softening of resonance modes with temperature enable extraction of interlayer exchange field as a function of temperature.

         <title>Consequences of Chirality in Directing the Pathway of Cholesteric Helix Inversion of &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Polymers by Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 2, January 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alternating copolymers of fluorene and azobenzene exhibit exceptional chiroptical properties in annealed thin films. The chiroptical properties, polymer chain alignment, and their supramolecular helicity can be fully controlled by irradiating with polarized light. Intriguingly, the diastereomeric relationship between the supramolecular helicity of polymer and the circular polarization of light leads to an asymmetric helix inversion pathway, reminiscent of molecular motors.








Abstract
Control over main&#8208;chain motion of chiral &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers can lead to unexpected new functionalities.&#160;Here, it is shown that by combining photoswitchable azobenzene units in conjugation with chiral fluorene comonomers and appropriate plasticizers, the polymer organization and chiroptical properties of these alternating copolymers steered by light and its state of polarization can be dynamically controlled. The configuration of the stereogenic centers in the side chains of the fluorene units determines the handedness of the cholesteric organization in thermally annealed films, indicating cooperative behavior. The polymer alignment and helicity of the supramolecular arrangement can be switched by irradiating with linearly and circularly polarized light, respectively.&#160;Intriguingly, when switching the handedness of thermally induced cholesteric organizations by illuminating with circularly polarized light that is opposite to the handedness of the cholesteric phases, a nematic&#8208;like intermediate state is observed during helix interconversion. By the sequence of irradiation with left and right circularly polarized light followed by thermal annealing, an asymmetric motion, reminiscent of that seen in molecular motors is observed. These findings suggest that functional conjugated polymers can exhibit emergent properties at mesoscopic scale.

         <title>A Low&#8208;Swelling Polymeric Mixed Conductor Operating in Aqueous Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 2, January 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although beneficial to ion transport, swelling can affect the performance and durability of organic mixed conductor devices. A hydrophilic conjugated polymer, poly[3&#8208;(6&#8208;hydroxy)hexylthiophene] is presented, and its swelling properties are compared to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art glycolated organic semiconductors for bioelectronics. Hydroxyl functionalization of poly(thiophene) backbone minimizes swelling while still allowing good ion uptake, resulting in robust organic electrochemical transistor operation in aqueous electrolytes.








Abstract
Organic mixed conductors find use in batteries, bioelectronics technologies, neuromorphic computing, and sensing. While great progress has been achieved, polymer&#8208;based mixed conductors frequently experience significant volumetric changes during ion uptake/rejection, i.e., during doping/de&#8208;doping and charging/discharging. Although ion dynamics may be enhanced in expanded networks, these volumetric changes can have undesirable consequences, e.g., negatively affecting hole/electron conduction and severely shortening device lifetime. Here, the authors present a new material poly[3&#8208;(6&#8208;hydroxy)hexylthiophene] (P3HHT) that is able to transport ions and electrons/holes, as tested in electrochemical absorption spectroscopy and organic electrochemical transistors, and that exhibits low swelling, attributed to the hydroxylated alkyl side&#8208;chain functionalization. P3HHT displays a thickness change upon passive swelling of only +2.5%, compared to +90% observed for the ubiquitous poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate, and +10 to +15% for polymers such as poly(2&#8208;(3,3&#8242;&#8208;bis(2&#8208;(2&#8208;(2&#8208;methoxyethoxy)ethoxy)ethoxy)&#8208;[2,2&#8242;&#8208;bithiophen]&#8208;5&#8208;yl)thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene) (p[g2T&#8208;TT]).

Importantly, the initial P3HHT film thickness is essentially restored after de&#8208;doping while p(g2T&#8208;TT) remains substantially swollen. The authors, thus, expand the materials&#8208;design toolbox for the creation of low&#8208;swelling soft mixed conductors with tailored properties and applications in bioelectronics and beyond.

&lt;p&gt;Although beneficial to ion transport, swelling can affect the performance and durability of organic mixed conductor devices. A hydrophilic conjugated polymer, poly[3&#8208;(6&#8208;hydroxy)hexylthiophene] is presented, and its swelling properties are compared to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art glycolated organic semiconductors for bioelectronics. Hydroxyl functionalization of poly(thiophene) backbone minimizes swelling while still allowing good ion uptake, resulting in robust organic electrochemical transistor operation in aqueous electrolytes.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic mixed conductors find use in batteries, bioelectronics technologies, neuromorphic computing, and sensing. While great progress has been achieved, polymer&#8208;based mixed conductors frequently experience significant volumetric changes during ion uptake/rejection, i.e., during doping/de&#8208;doping and charging/discharging. Although ion dynamics may be enhanced in expanded networks, these volumetric changes can have undesirable consequences, e.g., negatively affecting hole/electron conduction and severely shortening device lifetime. Here, the authors present a new material poly[3&#8208;(6&#8208;hydroxy)hexylthiophene] (P3HHT) that is able to transport ions and electrons/holes, as tested in electrochemical absorption spectroscopy and organic electrochemical transistors, and that exhibits low swelling, attributed to the hydroxylated alkyl side&#8208;chain functionalization. P3HHT displays a thickness change upon passive swelling of only +2.5%, compared to +90% observed for the ubiquitous poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate, and +10 to +15% for polymers such as poly(2&#8208;(3,3&#8242;&#8208;bis(2&#8208;(2&#8208;(2&#8208;methoxyethoxy)ethoxy)ethoxy)&#8208;[2,2&#8242;&#8208;bithiophen]&#8208;5&#8208;yl)thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene) (p[g2T&#8208;TT]). Applying a bias pulse during swelling, this discrepancy becomes even more pronounced, with the thickness of P3HHT films changing by &amp;lt;10%&#160;while that of p(g2T&#8208;TT) structures increases by +75 to +80%. Importantly, the initial P3HHT film thickness is essentially restored after de&#8208;doping while p(g2T&#8208;TT) remains substantially swollen.

         <title>Ternary Ta2PdS6 Atomic Layers for an Ultrahigh Broadband Photoresponsive Phototransistor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 2, January 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new 2D material, atomic layer Ta2PdS6, is introduced to the 2D family, and exhibits excellent optoelectronic and electronic performances including an ultrahigh photoresponsivity of 1.42&#160;&#215; 106 A W&#8722;1, photoconductive gain of 2.7&#160;&#215; 106, electron mobility of 25 cm2 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1, Ion/Ioff ratio of 106, and one&#8208;year air stability, making it a promising 2D material for nanoelectronic and nano&#8208;optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
2D noble&#8208;transition&#8208;metal chalcogenides (NTMCs) are emerging as a promising class of optoelectronic materials due to ultrahigh air stability, large bandgap tunability, and high photoresponse. Here, a new set of 2D NTMC: Ta2PdS6 atomic layers is developed, displaying the excellent comprehensive optoelectronic performance with an ultrahigh photoresponsivity of 1.42&#160;&#215; 106 A W&#8722;1, detectivity of 7.1&#160;&#215; 1010 Jones and a high photoconductive gain of 2.7&#160;&#215; 106 under laser illumination at a wavelength of 633&#160;nm with a power of 0.025 W m&#8722;2, which is ascribed to a photogating effect via study of the device band profiles. Especially, few&#8208;layer Ta2PdS6 exhibits a good broadband photoresponse, ranging from 450&#160;nm in the ultraviolet region to 1450&#160;nm in the shortwave infrared (SIR) region. Moreover, this material also delivers an impressive electronic performance with electron mobility of &#8776;25 cm2V&#8211;1s&#8211;1, Ion/Ioff ratio of 106, and a one&#8208;year air stability, which is better than those of most reported 2D materials. Our&#160;studies underscore Ta2PdS6 as a promising 2D material for nano&#8208;electronic and nano&#8208;optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Stabilizing Anionic Redox Chemistry in a Mn&#8208;Based Layered Oxide Cathode Constructed by Li&#8208;Deficient Pristine State</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 2, January 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
O3&#8208;type Li0.6[Li0.2Mn0.8]O2 is successfully developed, with the pristine state displaying both a Li excess in the transition metal layer and a deficiency in the alkali metal layer. Benefiting from stable structure evolution and Li migration processes, irreversible lattice oxygen loss and structure distortion are effectively restrained.








Abstract
Li&#8208;rich cathode materials are of significant interest for coupling anionic redox with cationic redox chemistry to achieve high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries. However, lattice oxygen loss and derived structure distortion would induce serious capacity loss and voltage decay, further hindering its practical application. Herein, a novel Li&#8208;rich cathode material, O3&#8208;type Li0.6[Li0.2Mn0.8]O2, is developed with the pristine state displaying both a Li excess in the transition metal layer and a deficiency in the alkali metal layer. Benefiting from stable structure evolution and Li migration processes, not only can high reversible capacity (&#8776;329 mAh g&#8722;1) be harvested but also irreversible/reversible anionic/cationic redox reactions are comprehensively assigned via the combination of in/ex situ spectroscopies. Furthermore, irreversible lattice oxygen loss and structure distortion are effectively restrained, resulting in long&#8208;term cycle stability (capacity drop of 0.045% per cycle, 500 cycles). Altogether, tuning the Li state in the alkali metal layer presents a promising way for modification of high&#8208;capacity Li&#8208;rich cathode candidates.

         <title>Transparent Hybrid Opals with Unexpected Strong Resonance&#8208;Enhanced Photothermal Energy Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 2, January 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optical absorption, being absent in the pure polymer matrix and that with ordered particles, is remarkably amplified in self&#8208;assembled polymer&#8208;tethered (brush) particles comprising low&#8208;contrast constituents. The amplification is shown to be caused by &#8220;photon slowdown&#8221; and to induce rapid &#8220;melting&#8221; of materials even in the absence of &#8220;visible&#8221; absorption.








Abstract
Photothermal energy conversion is of fundamental importance to applications ranging from drug delivery to microfluidics and from ablation to fabrication. It typically originates from absorptive processes in materials that&#8212;when coupled with non&#8208;radiative dissipative processes&#8212;allow the conversion of radiative energy into heat. Microstructure design provides versatile strategies for controlling light&#8211;matter interactions. In particular, the deliberate engineering of the band structure in photonic materials is known to be an effective approach to amplify absorption in materials. However, photonic amplification is generally tied to high optical contrast materials which limit the applicability of the concept to metamaterials such as microfabricated metal&#8211;air hybrids. This contribution describes the first observation of pronounced amplification of absorption in low contrast opals formed by the self&#8208;assembly of polymer&#8208;tethered particles. The dependence of the amplification factor on the length scale and degree of order of materials as well as the angle of incidence reveal that it is related to the slow photon effect. A remarkable amplification factor of 16 is shown to facilitate the rapid &#8220;melting&#8221; of opal films even in the absence of &#8220;visible&#8221; absorption. The results point to novel opportunities for tailoring light&#8211;matter interactions in hybrid materials that can benefit the manipulation and fabrication of functional materials.

Stable and highly luminescent CsCu2I3@Cs3Cu2I5 composites are synthesized through a one&#8208;step spin&#8208;coating method. They exhibit white&#8208;light emission through self&#8208;trapped excitons, as well as cold/warm white&#8208;light tuning. By using the composites as a white&#8208;light emitter, electrically driven cold/warm tunable WLEDs with a record color&#8208;rendering index of 91.6 are successfully demonstrated, and a long half&#8208;lifetime of 238.5 min is achieved.








Abstract
White light&#8208;emitting diodes (WLEDs) are promising next&#8208;generation solid&#8208;state light sources. However, the commercialization route for WLED production suffers from challenges in terms of insufficient color&#8208;rendering index (CRI), color instability, and incorporation of rare&#8208;earth elements. Herein, a new two&#8208;component strategy is developed by assembling two broadband emissive materials with self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs) for high CRI and stable WLEDs. The strategy addresses effectively the challenging issues facing current WLEDs. Based on first&#8208;principles thermodynamic calculations, copper&#8208;based ternary halides composites, CsCu2I3@Cs3Cu2I5, are synthesized by a facile one&#8208;step solution approach. The composites exhibit an ideal white&#8208;light emission with a cold/warm white&#8208;light tuning and a robust stability against heat, ultraviolet light, and environmental oxygen/moisture. A series of cold/warm tunable WLEDs is demonstrated with a maximum luminance of 145&#160;cd m&#8722;2 and an external quantum efficiency of 0.15%, and a record high CRI of 91.6 is achieved, which is the highest value for lead&#8208;free WLEDs. Importantly, the fabricated device demonstrates an excellent operation stability in a continuous current mode, exhibiting a long half&#8208;lifetime of 238.5&#160;min. The results promise the use of the hybrids of STEs&#8208;derived broadband emissive materials for high&#8208;performance WLEDs.

         <title>Stable, High&#8208;Efficiency Voltage&#8208;Dependent Color&#8208;Tunable Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with a Single Tetradentate Platinum(II) Emitter Having Long Operational Lifetime</title>

         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance voltage&#8208;dependent color&#8208;tunable organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with a single Pt[O^N^C^N] emitter are fabricated. The emission color can be tuned from warm white to natural white or from orange to yellowish green, depending upon the emitter used. High external quantum efficiency (23.23%), low efficiency roll&#8208;off, long&#8208;term stability (LT90&#160;= 19&#160;105 h) and continuously variable color enable these color&#8208;tunable OLEDs to find applications in smart wearable devices.








Abstract
Voltage&#8208;dependent, color&#8208;tunable organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) are appealing tools that can be used for the visualization of electronic output signal of sensors. Nonetheless, the literature&#8208;reported color&#8208;tunable OLEDs that have a simple single&#8208;cell device structure suffer from relatively low efficiency, pronounced efficiency roll&#8208;off, color&#8208;aging, and short operation lifetime, all of which limit their practical applications. Here, a novel co&#8208;host&#8208;in&#8208;double&#8208;emissive&#8208;layer (CHIDEL) device, designed to enhance the performance of color&#8208;tunable OLEDs with the use of a single tetradentate Pt[O^N^C^N] emitter, is described. When Pt&#8208;X&#8208;2 is used as a single emitter in an optimized CHIDEL device, a white OLED with tunable Commission International de I'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates from (0.47, 0.44) at 3&#160;V to (0.36, 0.48) at 11&#160;V, a high color rendering index of 82, and high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of up to 20.75% can be achieved. By using Pt&#8208;X&#8208;4 as a single emitter, the voltage&#8208;dependent color&#8208;tunable CHIDEL device, with CIE coordinates shifted from (0.56, 0.43) at 3&#160;V to (0.42, 0.55) at 11&#160;V, demonstrates a high luminance of beyond 90 000&#160;cd m&#8722;2 and a high EQE of 23.23% at a luminance of 1300&#160;cd m&#8722;2. A long&#8208;lifetime time to 90% of the initial luminance (LT90) of almost 20&#160;000 h is demonstrated for the color&#8208;tunable OLED with Pt&#8208;X&#8208;4 emitting dopant.

         <title>Tailored Graphene Micropatterns by Wafer&#8208;Scale Direct Transfer for Flexible Chemical Sensor Platform</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 2, January 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to micropattern 2D materials on large&#8208;scale flexible substrates using a direct polymer curing transfer method is demonstrated. Graphene microchannels on polymer substrates exhibit ultrahigh effective self&#8208;heating under an applied bias voltage of less than 10&#160;V. An entirely flexible and transparent chemical sensor array based on graphene micropatterns successfully discriminates gas species under the self&#8208;activated state without external heating.








Abstract
2D materials, such as graphene, exhibit great potential as functional materials for numerous novel applications due to their excellent properties. The grafting of conventional micropatterning techniques on new types of electronic devices is required to fully utilize the unique nature of graphene. However, the conventional lithography and polymer&#8208;supported transfer methods often induce the contamination and damage of the graphene surface due to polymer residues and harsh wet&#8208;transfer conditions. Herein, a novel strategy to obtain micropatterned graphene on polymer substrates using a direct curing process is demonstrated. Employing this method, entirely flexible, transparent, well&#8208;defined self&#8208;activated graphene sensor arrays, capable of gas discrimination without external heating, are fabricated on 4 in. wafer&#8208;scale substrates. Finite element method simulations show the potential of this patterning technique to maximize the performance of the sensor devices when the active channels of the 2D material are suspended and nanoscaled. This study contributes considerably to the development of flexible functional electronic devices based on 2D materials.

         <title>Full Concentration Gradient&#8208;Tailored Li&#8208;Rich Layered Oxides for High&#8208;Energy Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 2, January 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A precise elemental gradient design for practical lithium&#8208;rich layered oxide (LLO) agglomerated spheres is developed, providing a unique tool for the optimization of voltage retention and electrochemical/thermal stability of lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The effects of elemental gradient on the LLOs, especially from a mechanical/electrochemical stress point of view, are quantitively elucidated for stability evaluation.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;rich layered oxides (LLOs) are prospective cathode materials for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), but severe voltage decay and energy attenuation with cycling still hinder their practical applications. Herein, a series of full concentration gradient&#8208;tailored agglomerated&#8208;sphere LLOs are designed with linearly decreasing Mn and linearly increasing Ni and Co from the particle center to the surface. The gradient&#8208;tailored LLOs exhibit noticeably reduced voltage decay, enhanced rate performance, improved cycle stability, and thermal stability. Without any material modifications or electrolyte optimizations, the gradient&#8208;tailored LLO with medium&#8208;slope shows the best electrochemical performance, with a very low average voltage decay of 0.8&#160;mV per cycle as well as a capacity retention of 88.4% within 200 cycles at 200&#160;mA g&#8722;1. These excellent findings are due to spinel structure suppression, electrochemical stress optimization, and Jahn&#8208;Teller effect inhibition. Further investigation shows that the gradient&#8208;tailored LLO reduces the thermal release percentage by as much as about 41% when the battery is charged to 4.4&#160;V. This study provides an effective method to suppress the voltage decay of LLOs for further practical utilization in LIBs and also puts forward a bulk&#8208;structure design strategy to prepare better electrode materials for different rechargeable batteries.

         <dc:description>
The combination of yellow&#8208;emissive CsCu2I3 and blue&#8208;emissive Cs3Cu2I5 for environmentally friendly white LEDs is demonstrated by Zhifeng Shi, Lijun Zhang, Chongxin Shan, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2001367. Both copper halides are highly stable against heat, ultraviolet light, and oxygen/moisture degradation, as is demonstrated, and they use this strategy to overcome photon self&#8208;absorption, color instability, and lead&#8208;toxicity issues, which are among the challenges faced for perovskite white LEDs.

         <title>Hybrid Opals: Transparent Hybrid Opals with Unexpected Strong Resonance&#8208;Enhanced Photothermal Energy Conversion (Adv. Mater. 2/2021)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 2, January 14, 2021. </description>

In article number 2004732, Michael R. Bockstaller, George Fytas, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate an order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude amplification of optical absorption in low&#8208;contrast opals formed by the self&#8208;assembly of polymer&#8208;tethered nanoparticles. The amplification is shown to be caused by the &#8220;slow photons effect&#8221; and to induce rapid &#8220;melting&#8221; of the opal films even in the absence of visible absorption. This work points to novel opportunities for tailoring light&#8211;matter interactions in hybrid materials by deliberate engineering of the molecular structure of polymer chains at interfaces.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Design and Sensing Applications of Hemin/Coordination Polymer&#8208;Based Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 2, January 14, 2021. </description>

By combining the properties of hemin and porous coordination polymers into novel nanocomposites, different types of sensors can be generated for testing the concentrations of different biological molecules. These biosensors are based on electrochemical, chemiluminescent, or colorimetric techniques, and have excellent detection limits and stability.








Abstract
The fabrication of biomimetic catalysts as substituents for enzymes is of critical interest in the field due to the problems associated with the extraction, purification, and storage of enzymes in sensing applications. Of these mimetics, hemin/coordination polymer&#8208;based nanocomposites, mainly hemin/metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOF), have been developed for various biosensing applications because of the unique properties of each component, while trying to mimic the normal biological functions of heme within the protein milieu of enzymes. This critical review first discusses the different catalytic functions of heme in the body in the form of enzyme/protein structures. The properties of hemin dimerization are then elucidated with the supposed models of hemin oxidation. After that, the progress in the fabrication of hemin/MOF nanocomposites for the sensing of diverse biological molecules is discussed. Finally, the challenges in developing this type of composites are examined as well as possible proposals for future directions to enhance the sensing performance in this field further.

         <title>Recent Advances and Perspectives on Calcium&#8208;Ion Storage: Key Materials and Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 2, January 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ca&#8208;ion based technologies are attractive for low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;performance energy storage, while their development is currently far from practical applications. An overview of the key electrode materials for Ca2+ storage and a comprehensive insight of promising optimization strategies such as the multi&#8208;ion strategy are critical to promote further development of Ca2+ technologies.








Abstract
The urgent demand for cost&#8208;effective energy storage devices for large&#8208;scale applications has led to the development of several beyond&#8208;lithium energy storage systems (EESs). Among them, calcium&#8208;ion batteries (CIBs) are attractive due to abundant calcium resources, excellent volumetric and gravimetric capacities of Ca metal anode, and potential high energy density coming from the multivalent feature of Ca&#8208;ion. Therefore, the exploration of CIBs electrode materials and the construction of CIBs devices are gaining increasing research interest. Relevant publications cover a wide range of materials by both theoretical and experimental investigations, whereas the performances of rocking&#8208;chair CIBs have been unsatisfactory. Meanwhile, multi&#8208;ion strategies using more than one ion as the charge carrier have been demonstrated to be feasible and promising options in realizing room temperature CIBs. The summary and reflection of previous studies would provide useful information for future exploration and optimization. In this circumstance, this paper overviews the reported CIBs electrode materials, including both anode and cathode, and presents the latest progress of multi&#8208;ion strategies in CIBs. Fundamental challenges, potential solutions, and opportunities are accordingly proposed, mimicking other more mature EESs. This review may promote the development of electrode materials and accelerate the construction of low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance CIBs.

         <title>Tailored Mesoporous Inorganic Biomaterials: Assembly, Functionalization, and Drug Delivery Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 2, January 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tailored mesoporous inorganic nanocarriers with abundant compositions and structures exhibit unprecedented drug&#8208;loading capacity and sustained responsive release behavior under various stimuli (e.g., pH, redox, temperature, magnetic field, and light), and the exceptionally mesoporous structure plays an important role in the diffusion and transport of drug molecules, which will open a new door for drug therapy and new biological nanocarriers.








Abstract
Infectious or immune diseases have caused serious threat to human health due to their complexity and specificity, and emerging drug delivery systems (DDSs) have evolved into the most promising therapeutic strategy for drug&#8208;targeted therapy. Various mesoporous biomaterials are exploited and applied as efficient nanocarriers to loading drugs by virtue of their large surface area, high porosity, and prominent biocompatibility. Nanosized mesoporous nanocarriers show great potential in biomedical research, and it has become the research hotspot in the interdisciplinary field. Herein, recent progress and assembly mechanisms on mesoporous inorganic biomaterials (e.g., silica, carbon, metal oxide) are summarized systematically, and typical functionalization methods (i.e., hybridization, polymerization, and doping) for nanocarriers are also discussed in depth. Particularly, structure&#8211;activity relationship and the effect of physicochemical parameters of mesoporous biomaterials, including morphologies (e.g., hollow, core&#8211;shell), pore textures (e.g., pore size, pore volume), and surface features (e.g., roughness and hydrophilic/hydrophobic) in DDS application are overviewed and elucidated in detail. As one of the important development directions, advanced stimuli&#8208;responsive DDSs (e.g., pH, temperature, redox, ultrasound, light, magnetic field) are highlighted. Finally, the prospect of mesoporous biomaterials in disease therapeutics is stated, and it will open a new spring for the development of mesoporous nanocarriers.

         <title>Indium Nitride at the 2D Limit</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 1, January 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bilayer of InN is formed between graphene and SiC by an intercalation process. The coverage of the SiC surface is very high, above 90%. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) measurements prove a bandgap value of 2&#160;&#177; 0.1&#160;eV for the 2D InN.








Abstract
The properties of 2D InN are predicted to substantially differ from the bulk crystal. The predicted appealing properties relate to strong in&#8208; and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane excitons, high electron mobility, efficient strain engineering of their electronic and optical properties, and strong application potential in gas sensing. Until now, the realization of 2D InN remained elusive. In this work, the formation of 2D InN and measurements of its bandgap are reported. Bilayer InN is formed between graphene and SiC by an intercalation process in metal&#8211;organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). The thickness uniformity of the intercalated structure is investigated by conductive atomic force microscopy (C&#8208;AFM) and the structural properties by atomic resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The coverage of the SiC surface is very high, above 90%, and a major part of the intercalated structure is represented by two sub&#8208;layers of indium (In) bonded to nitrogen (N). Scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) measurements give a bandgap value of 2&#160;&#177; 0.1&#160;eV for the 2D InN. The stabilization of 2D InN with a pragmatic wide bandgap and high lateral uniformity of intercalation is demonstrated.

         <title>Lifshitz Transition and Non&#8208;Fermi Liquid Behavior in Highly Doped Semimetals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 1, January 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A physical model to quantitatively explain the Lifshitz transition and non&#8208;Fermi liquid behavior in highly doped monoclinic Nb2Se3 is reported. Based on Hall and magnetoresistance measurements, the two&#8208;band Drude model, and first&#8208;principles calculations, the non&#8208;quadratic temperature exponent in the resistivity can be quantitatively determined by the chemical potential shift under the framework of Fermi liquid theory.








Abstract
The classical Fermi liquid theory and Drude model have provided fundamental ways to understand the resistivity of most metals. The violation of the classical theory, known as non&#8208;Fermi liquid (NFL) transport, appears in certain metals, including topological semimetals, but quantitative understanding of the NFL behavior has not yet been established. In particular, the determination of the non&#8208;quadratic temperature exponent in the resistivity, a sign of NFL behavior, remains a puzzling issue. Here, a physical model to quantitatively explain the Lifshitz transition and NFL behavior in highly doped (a carrier density of &#8776;1022 cm&#8722;3) monoclinic Nb2Se3 is reported. Hall and magnetoresistance measurements, the two&#8208;band Drude model, and first&#8208;principles calculations demonstrate an apparent chemical potential shift by temperature in monoclinic Nb2Se3, which induces a Lifshitz transition and NFL behavior in the material. Accordingly, the non&#8208;quadratic temperature exponent in the resistivity can be quantitatively determined by the chemical potential shift under the framework of Fermi liquid theory. This model provides a new experimental insight for nontrivial transport with NFL behavior or sign inversion of Seebeck coefficients in emerging materials.

Hall and magnetoresistance measurements, the two&#8208;band Drude model, and first&#8208;principles calculations demonstrate an apparent chemical potential shift by temperature in monoclinic Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, which induces a Lifshitz transition and NFL behavior in the material. Accordingly, the non&#8208;quadratic temperature exponent in the resistivity can be quantitatively determined by the chemical potential shift under the framework of Fermi liquid theory. This model provides a new experimental insight for nontrivial transport with NFL behavior or sign inversion of Seebeck coefficients in emerging materials.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Electrochemical Delamination of Ultralarge Few&#8208;Layer Black Phosphorus with a Hydrogen&#8208;Free Intercalation Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 1, January 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultralarge few&#8208;layer black&#8208;phosphorus single crystals are obtained with a hydrogen&#8208;free electrochemical exfoliation mechanism using CH3COOTBA intercalation. The largest size is up to 119 &#181;m with an average around at 77.6 &#177; 15.0 &#181;m. A high hole mobility of 76 cm2 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1, and a broadband photoresponse from 532 to 1850 nm with ultrahigh responsivity are achieved at 298 K.








Abstract
Due to strong interlayer interaction and ease of oxidation issues of black phosphorus (BP), the domain size of artificial synthesized few&#8208;layer black phosphorus (FL&#8208;BP) crystals is often below 10&#160;&#181;m, which extremely limits its further applications in large&#8208;area thin&#8208;film devices and integrated circuits. Herein, a hydrogen&#8208;free electrochemical delamination strategy through weak Lewis acid intercalation enabled exfoliation is developed to produce ultralarge FL&#8208;BP single&#8208;crystalline domains with high quality. The interaction between the weak Lewis acid tetra&#8208;n&#8208;butylammonium acetate (CH3COOTBA) and P atoms promotes the average domain size of FL&#8208;BP crystal up to 77.6&#160;&#177; 15.0&#160;&#181;m and the largest domain size is found to be as large as 119&#160;&#181;m. The presence of H+ and H2O is found to sharply decrease the size of as&#8208;exfoliated FL&#8208;BP flakes. The electronic transport measurements show that the delaminated FL&#8208;BP crystals exhibit a high hole mobility of 76 cm2 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1 and an on/off ratio of 103 at 298 K. A broadband photoresponse from 532 to 1850&#160;nm with ultrahigh responsivity is achieved. This work provides a scalable, simple, and low&#8208;cost approach for large&#8208;area BP films that meet industrial requirements for nanodevices applications.

         <title>All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries with a Limited Lithium Metal Anode at Room Temperature using a Garnet&#8208;Based Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 1, January 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Owing to the stability between lithium metal and a garnet&#8208;type solid electrolyte, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) are proved to possess longer cycling life than that of liquid&#8208;state LMBs under limited lithium&#8208;anode condition. Moreover, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state LMBs with long cycling life using a limited lithium&#8208;metal anode are achieved at room temperature through a hybrid solid&#8208;state electrolyte design.








Abstract
Metallic lithium (Li), considered as the ultimate anode, is expected to promise high&#8208;energy rechargeable batteries. However, owing to the continuous Li consumption during the repeated Li plating/stripping cycling, excess amount of the Li metal anode is commonly utilized in lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs), leading to reduced energy density and increased cost. Here, an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal battery (ASSLMB) based on a garnet&#8208;oxide solid electrolyte with an ultralow negative/positive electrode capacity ratio (N/P ratio) is reported. Compared with the counterpart using a liquid electrolyte at the same low N/P ratios, ASSLMBs show longer cycling life, which is attributed to the higher Coulombic efficiency maintained during cycling. The effect of the species of the interface layer on the cycling performance of ASSLMBs with low N/P ratio is also studied. Importantly, it is demonstrated that the ASSLMB using a limited Li metal anode paired with a LiFePO4 cathode (5.9 N/P ratio) delivers a stable long&#8208;term cycling performance at room temperature. Furthermore, it is revealed that enhanced specific energies for ASSLMBs with low N/P ratios can be further achieved by the use of a high&#8208;voltage or high mass&#8208;loading cathode. This study sheds light on the practical high&#8208;energy all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries under the constrained condition of a limited Li metal anode.

         <title>A Wearable Nutrition Tracker</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 1, January 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wearable nutrient tracker that allows monitoring of vitamin C in sweat, along with urine and blood, to assist tracking users&#8217; nutritional status is demonstrated. A longitudinal study is performed on two individuals to explore correlations of vitamin C concentrations in sweat and urine with blood. It has promising potential applications in nutritional assessment and dietary intervention.








Abstract
Nutrients are essential for the healthy development and proper maintenance of body functions in humans. For adequate nourishment, it is important to keep track of nutrients level in the body, apart from consuming sufficient nutrition that is in line with dietary guidelines. Sweat, which contains rich chemical information, is an attractive biofluid for routine non&#8208;invasive assessment of nutrient levels. Herein, a wearable sensor that can selectively measure vitamin C concentration in biofluids, including sweat, urine, and blood is developed. Detection through an electrochemical sensor modified with Au nanostructures, LiClO4&#8208;doped conductive polymer, and an enzymes&#8208;immobilized membrane is utilized to achieve wide detection linearity, high selectivity, and long&#8208;term stability. The sensor allows monitoring of temporal changes in vitamin C levels. The effect of vitamin C intake on the sweat and urine profile is explored by monitoring concentration changes upon consuming different amounts of vitamin C. A longitudinal study of sweat's and urine's vitamin C correlation with blood is performed on two individuals. The results suggest that sweat and urine analysis can be a promising method to routinely monitor nutrition through the sweat sensor and that this sensor can facilitate applications such as nutritional screening and dietary intervention.

         <title>Solution&#8208;Processed All&#8208;Ceramic Plasmonic Metamaterials for Efficient Solar&#8211;Thermal Conversion over 100&#8211;727&#160;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 1, January 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solution&#8208;processed large&#8208;area plasmonic metamaterial with all&#8208;ceramic components is demonstrated to achieve high solar absorption but low IR emission over 100&#8211;727&#160;&#176;C, leading to higher solar&#8211;thermal conversion efficiency than vacuum&#8208;deposited absorbers. Accompanied by its great thermal stability (727&#160;&#176;C) and low cost (&lt;1.6&#160;USD&#160;m&#8722;2), the versatile metamaterial will benefit both low&#8208; and high&#8208;temperature solar&#8211;thermal systems.








Abstract
Low&#8208;cost and large&#8208;area solar&#8211;thermal absorbers with superior spectral selectivity and excellent thermal stability are vital for efficient and large&#8208;scale solar&#8211;thermal conversion applications, such as space heating, desalination, ice mitigation, photothermal catalysis, and concentrating solar power. Few state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art selective absorbers are qualified for both low&#8208; (&lt;200&#160;&#176;C) and high&#8208;temperature (&gt;600&#160;&#176;C) applications due to insufficient spectral selectivity or thermal stability over a wide temperature range. Here, a high&#8208;performance plasmonic metamaterial selective absorber is developed by facile solution&#8208;based processes via assembling an ultrathin (&#8776;120&#160;nm) titanium nitride (TiN) nanoparticle film on a TiN mirror. Enabled by the synergetic in&#8208;plane plasmon and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot resonances, the all&#8208;ceramic plasmonic metamaterial simultaneously achieves high, full&#8208;spectrum solar absorption (95%), low mid&#8208;IR emission (3% at 100&#160;&#176;C), and excellent stability over a temperature range of 100&#8211;727&#160;&#176;C, even outperforming most vacuum&#8208;deposited absorbers at their specific operating temperatures. The competitive performance of the solution&#8208;processed absorber is accompanied by a significant cost reduction compared with vacuum&#8208;deposited absorbers. All these merits render it a cost&#8208;effective, universal solution to offering high efficiency (89&#8211;93%) for both low&#8208; and high&#8208;temperature solar&#8211;thermal applications.

&lt;p&gt;Low&#8208;cost and large&#8208;area solar&#8211;thermal absorbers with superior spectral selectivity and excellent thermal stability are vital for efficient and large&#8208;scale solar&#8211;thermal conversion applications, such as space heating, desalination, ice mitigation, photothermal catalysis, and concentrating solar power. Few state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art selective absorbers are qualified for both low&#8208; (&lt;b&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/b&gt;200&#160;&lt;b&gt;&#176;&lt;/b&gt;C) and high&#8208;temperature (&lt;b&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/b&gt;600&#160;&lt;b&gt;&#176;&lt;/b&gt;C) applications due to insufficient spectral selectivity or thermal stability over a wide temperature range. Here, a high&#8208;performance plasmonic metamaterial selective absorber is developed by facile solution&#8208;based processes via assembling an ultrathin (&lt;b&gt;&#8776;&lt;/b&gt;120&#160;nm) titanium nitride (TiN) nanoparticle film on a TiN mirror. Enabled by the synergetic in&#8208;plane plasmon and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot resonances, the all&#8208;ceramic plasmonic metamaterial simultaneously achieves high, full&#8208;spectrum solar absorption (95%), low mid&#8208;IR emission (3% at 100&#160;&lt;b&gt;&#176;&lt;/b&gt;C), and excellent stability over a temperature range of 100&#8211;727&#160;&lt;b&gt;&#176;&lt;/b&gt;C, even outperforming most vacuum&#8208;deposited absorbers at their specific operating temperatures. The competitive performance of the solution&#8208;processed absorber is accompanied by a significant cost reduction compared with vacuum&#8208;deposited absorbers. All these merits render it a cost&#8208;effective, universal solution to offering high efficiency (89&#8211;93%) for both low&#8208; and high&#8208;temperature solar&#8211;thermal applications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Blue Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Enabled by Efficient Energy Transfer between Coupled Quasi&#8208;2D Perovskite Layers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 1, January 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional ligand of the 4&#8208;(2&#8208;aminoethyl) benzoic acid cation is incorporated into a perovskite to simultaneously diminish the weak van der Waals gap and passivate the defects for efficient energy transfer and radiative recombination. Fabricated blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes show an external quantum efficiency of 10.11% and a long stability of 81.3 min, indicating that this is an effective approach for high device performance.








Abstract
While there has been extensive investigation into modulating quasi&#8208;2D perovskite compositions in light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) for promoting their electroluminescence, very few reports have studied approaches involving enhancement of the energy transfer between quasi&#8208;2D perovskite layers of the film, which plays very important role for achieving high&#8208;performance perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs). In this work, a bifunctional ligand of 4&#8208;(2&#8208;aminoethyl)benzoic acid (ABA) cation is strategically introduced into the perovskite to diminish the weak van der Waals gap between individual perovskite layers for promoting coupled quasi&#8208;2D perovskite layers. In particular, the strengthened interaction between coupled quasi&#8208;2D perovskite layers favors an efficient energy transfer in the perovskite films. The introduced ABA can also simultaneously passivate the perovskite defects by reducing metallic Pb for less nonradiative recombination loss. Benefiting from the advanced properties of ABA incorporated perovskites, highly efficient blue PeLEDs with external quantum efficiency of 10.11% and a very long operational stability of 81.3&#160;min, among the best performing blue quasi&#8208;2D PeLEDs, are achieved. Consequently, this work contributes an effective approach for high&#8208;performance and stable blue PeLEDs toward practical applications.

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Photoengraving of Monolithic, Multifaceted Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 1, January 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D photoengraving strategy capable of integrating diverse metasurfaces into a single composite monolith is demonstrated.&#160;This&#160;method facilitates micro&#8208;/nanoscale patterning of metasurfaces onto individual facets in a diverse range of 3D scaffolds, in an independent, high&#8208;throughput, and on&#8208;demand fashion.








Abstract
Metasurfaces present a potent platform to manipulate light by the spatial arrangement of sub&#8208;wavelength patterns with well&#8208;defined sizes and geometries, in thin films. Metasurfaces by definition are planar. However, it would be highly desirable to integrate metasurfaces with diverse, spatially programmed sub&#8208;wavelength features into a 3D monolith, to manipulate light within a compact 3D space. Here, a 3D photoengraving strategy is presented; that is, generation of such composite metasurfaces from a single microstructure via the irradiation of multiple interference laser beams onto different facets of the parent azopolymeric microstructure. Through &#8220;photofluidization,&#8221;&#160;this&#160;technique enables independent inscription and erasing of metasurfaces onto and from individual facets of 3D monoliths with arbitrary shapes and dimensions, in a high&#8208;throughput fashion (over approximately a few cm2 at a time). By engraving discrete sub&#8208;wavelength 1D surface relief gratings of different pitches on different facets of an inverse pyramidal array, a multiplexing structure&#8208;color filter is demonstrated.

         <title>Quasi&#8208;Epitaxial Growth of Magnetic Nanostructures on 4H&#8208;Au Nanoribbons</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 1, January 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystal&#8208;phase engineering of Co and Ni nanostructures is reported, which is realized by quasi&#8208;epitaxial growth on 4H&#8208;Au nanoribbons. Notably, a new phase of Co, namely 14H, is formed due to the generation of ordered misfit dislocations in the grown Co nanostructures. The as&#8208;prepared 14H&#8208;Co nanostructures are ferromagnetic at room temperature.








Abstract
Phase engineering of nanomaterials is an effective strategy to tune the physicochemical properties of nanomaterials for various promising applications. Herein, by using the 4H&#8208;Au nanoribbons as templates, four novel magnetic nanostructures, namely 4H&#8208;Au&#8202;@&#8202;14H&#8208;Co nanobranches, 4H&#8208;Au&#8202;@&#8202;14H&#8208;Co nanoribbons, 4H&#8208;Au&#8202;@&#8202;2H&#8208;Co nanoribbons, and 4H&#8208;Au&#8202;@&#8202;2H&#8208;Ni nanoribbons, are synthesized based on the quasi&#8208;epitaxial growth. Different from the conventional epitaxial growth of metal nanomaterials, the obtained Co and Ni nanostructures possess different crystal phases from the Au template. Due to the large lattice mismatch between Au and the grown metals (i.e., Co and Ni), ordered misfit dislocations are generated at the Co/Au and Ni/Au interfaces. Notably, a new super&#8208;structure of Co is formed, denoted as 14H. Both 4H&#8208;Au&#8202;@&#8202;14H&#8208;Co nanobranches and nanoribbons are ferromagnetic at room temperature, showing similar Curie temperature. However, their magnetic behaviors exhibit distinct temperature dependence, resulting from the competition between spin and volume fluctuations as well as the unique geometry. This work paves the way to the templated synthesis of nanomaterials with unconventional crystal phases for the exploration of phase&#8208;dependent properties.

         <title>Thiophene&#8208;Bridged Donor&#8211;Acceptor sp2&#8208;Carbon&#8208;Linked 2D Conjugated Polymers as Photocathodes for Water Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 1, January 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bithiophene&#8208;bridged D&#8211;A&#8208;based 2D sp2&#8208;carbon&#8208;linked conjugated polymer (2D CCP&#8208;Th) is synthesized via Knoevenagel polymerization. Benefiting from the robust sp2&#8208;carbon&#8208;linked conjugations and donor&#8211;acceptor structures, when employed as a photocathode for water reduction, 2D CCP&#8208;Th demonstrates a superb saturated photocurrent density (5.5 &#181;A cm&#8722;2 at 0.3&#160;V and 7.9 &#181;A cm&#8722;2 at 0&#160;V vs reversible hydrogen electrode).








Abstract
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water reduction, converting solar energy into environmentally friendly hydrogen fuel, requires delicate design and synthesis of semiconductors with appropriate bandgaps, suitable energy levels of the frontier orbitals, and high intrinsic charge mobility. In this work, the synthesis of a novel bithiophene&#8208;bridged donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;based 2D sp2&#8208;carbon&#8208;linked conjugated polymer (2D CCP) is demonstrated. The Knoevenagel polymerization between the electron&#8208;accepting building block 2,3,8,9,14,15&#8208;hexa(4&#8208;formylphenyl) diquinoxalino[2,3&#8208;a:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;c]phenazine (HATN&#8208;6CHO) and the first electron&#8208;donating linker 2,2&#8242;&#8208;([2,2&#8242;&#8208;bithiophene]&#8208;5,5&#8242;&#8208;diyl)diacetonitrile (ThDAN) provides the 2D CCP&#8208;HATNThDAN (2D CCP&#8208;Th). Compared with the corresponding biphenyl&#8208;bridged 2D CCP&#8208;HATN&#8208;BDAN (2D CCP&#8208;BD), the bithiophene&#8208;based 2D CCP&#8208;Th exhibits a wide light&#8208;harvesting range (up to 674&#160;nm), a optical energy gap (2.04&#160;eV), and highest energy occupied molecular orbital&#8211;lowest unoccupied molecular orbital distributions for facilitated charge transfer, which make 2D CCP&#8208;Th a promising candidate for PEC water reduction. As a result, 2D CCP&#8208;Th presents a superb H2&#8208;evolution photocurrent density up to &#8776;7.9 &#181;A cm&#8722;2 at 0&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, which is superior to the reported 2D covalent organic frameworks and most carbon nitride materials (0.09&#8211;6.0 &#181;A cm&#8722;2). Density functional theory calculations identify the thiophene units and cyano substituents at the vinylene linkage as active sites for the evolution of H2.

&lt;p&gt;A bithiophene&#8208;bridged D&#8211;A&#8208;based 2D sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;carbon&#8208;linked conjugated polymer (2D CCP&#8208;Th) is synthesized via Knoevenagel polymerization. Benefiting from the robust sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;carbon&#8208;linked conjugations and donor&#8211;acceptor structures, when employed as a photocathode for water reduction, 2D CCP&#8208;Th demonstrates a superb saturated photocurrent density (5.5 &#181;A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.3&#160;V and 7.9 &#181;A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 0&#160;V vs reversible hydrogen electrode).


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water reduction, converting solar energy into environmentally friendly hydrogen fuel, requires delicate design and synthesis of semiconductors with appropriate bandgaps, suitable energy levels of the frontier orbitals, and high intrinsic charge mobility. In this work, the synthesis of a novel bithiophene&#8208;bridged donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;based 2D sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;carbon&#8208;linked conjugated polymer (2D CCP) is demonstrated. The Knoevenagel polymerization between the electron&#8208;accepting building block 2,3,8,9,14,15&#8208;hexa(4&#8208;formylphenyl) diquinoxalino[2,3&#8208;a:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;c]phenazine (HATN&#8208;6CHO) and the first electron&#8208;donating linker 2,2&#8242;&#8208;([2,2&#8242;&#8208;bithiophene]&#8208;5,5&#8242;&#8208;diyl)diacetonitrile (ThDAN) provides the 2D CCP&#8208;HATNThDAN (2D CCP&#8208;Th). Compared with the corresponding biphenyl&#8208;bridged 2D CCP&#8208;HATN&#8208;BDAN (2D CCP&#8208;BD), the bithiophene&#8208;based 2D CCP&#8208;Th exhibits a wide light&#8208;harvesting range (up to 674&#160;nm), a optical energy gap (2.04&#160;eV), and highest energy occupied molecular orbital&#8211;lowest unoccupied molecular orbital distributions for facilitated charge transfer, which make 2D CCP&#8208;Th a promising candidate for PEC water reduction. As a result, 2D CCP&#8208;Th presents a superb H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;evolution photocurrent density up to &#8776;7.9 &#181;A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 0&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, which is superior to the reported 2D covalent organic frameworks and most carbon nitride materials (0.09&#8211;6.0 &#181;A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Density functional theory calculations identify the thiophene units and cyano substituents at the vinylene linkage as active sites for the evolution of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Packaged 3D Lithium&#8208;Ion Microbatteries Fabricated Using Imprint Lithography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 1, January 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance microbatteries with high active volume fraction, thick, 3D&#8208;structured electrodes (V2O5 cathode and Li metal anode) are realized through a combination of imprint lithography, self&#8208;assembly, and electrodeposition. The microbattery is infilled with a gel electrolyte to facilitate hermetic packaging. The packaged cell exhibits high areal energy and power densities of 1.24 J cm&#8722;2 and 75.5 mW cm&#8722;2, respectively.








Abstract
Fabrication of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and high&#8208;power&#8208;density packaged long&#8208;cycle&#8208;life rechargeable microbatteries remains a considerable challenge. Here, high&#8208;performance microbatteries with high active volume fraction, thick, 3D&#8208;structured electrodes (V2O5 cathode and Li metal anode) are realized through a combination of imprint lithography, self&#8208;assembly, and electrodeposition. To assist the critical challenge of hermetic packaging, the microbattery is infilled with a gel electrolyte. The packaged cell exhibits high areal energy and power densities of 1.24 J cm&#8722;2 and 75.5&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, respectively, and can be cycled 550 times in argon or 200 times in air with 75% capacity retention of the initial discharge capacity. An unpackaged cell, using a liquid electrolyte, provides a power density of 218&#160;mW cm&#8722;2. As far as it is known, the microbatteries have the highest peak power density among all reported microbatteries.

         <title>Electroreduction of Carbon Dioxide Driven by the Intrinsic Defects in the Carbon Plane of a Single Fe&#8211;N4 Site</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 1, January 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The outstanding electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction activity of the intrinsic defect in a carbon&#8208;based catalyst containing a single Fe&#8211;N4 site is highlighted. Benefiting from its immunity for the adsorbed intermediates, such as *CO, as well as the enhanced intrinsic activity after incorporating with the Fe&#8211;N4 site, the intrinsic defect acts as the real active center for carbon dioxide reduction and outperforms single Fe&#8211;N4 centers.








Abstract
Manipulating the in&#8208;plane defects of metal&#8211;nitrogen&#8211;carbon catalysts to regulate the electroreduction reaction of CO2 (CO2RR) remains a challenging task. Here, it is demonstrated that the activity of the intrinsic carbon defects can be dramatically improved through coupling with single&#8208;atom Fe&#8211;N4 sites. The resulting catalyst delivers a maximum CO Faradaic efficiency of 90% and a CO partial current density of 33&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in 0.1 m KHCO3. The remarkable enhancements are maintained in concentrated electrolyte, endowing a rechargeable Zn&#8211;CO2 battery with a high CO selectivity of 86.5% at 5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Further analysis suggests that the intrinsic defect is the active sites for CO2RR, instead of the Fe&#8211;N4 center. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the Fe&#8211;N4 coupled intrinsic defect exhibits a reduced energy barrier for CO2RR and suppresses the hydrogen evolution activity. The high intrinsic activity, coupled with fast electron&#8208;transfer capability and abundant exposed active sites, induces excellent electrocatalytic performance.

         <title>Observation of Supercavity Modes in Subwavelength Dielectric Resonators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 1, January 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Excitation of supercavity modes in high&#8208;index subwavelength dielectric resonators in the radio&#8208;frequency range is demonstrated in near&#8208;field and far&#8208;field measurements. The measured unloaded Q factor of supercavity modes is in the range from 500 to 12&#160;500, limited by absorption losses. A peculiar change of the directivity pattern of supercavity modes and their relation to Fano resonances is shown experimentally.








Abstract
Electromagnetic response of dielectric resonators with high refractive index is governed by optically induced electric and magnetic Mie resonances facilitating confinement of light with the amplitude enhancement. Traditionally, strong subwavelength trapping of light was associated only with plasmonic or epsilon&#8208;near&#8208;zero structures, which however suffer from material losses. Recently, an alternative localization mechanism was proposed allowing the trapping of light in individual subwavelength optical resonators with a high quality factor in the regime of a supercavity mode. Here, the experimental observation of the supercavity modes in subwavelength ceramic resonators in the radio&#8208;frequency range is presented. It is experimentally demonstrated that the regime of supercavity modes can be achieved via precise tuning of the resonator's dimensions. A huge growth of the unloaded quality factor is achieved with experimental values up to 1.25&#160;&#215; 104, limited only by material losses of ceramics. It is revealed that the supercavity modes can be excited efficiently both in the near&#8208; and far&#8208;field. In both cases, the supercavity mode manifests itself explicitly as a Fano resonance with characteristic peculiarities of spectral shape and radiation pattern. A comparison of supercavities made of diversified materials for the visible, infrared, THz, and radio&#8208;frequency regimes is provided.

         <title>Imaging Cellular Aerobic Glycolysis using Carbon Dots for Early Warning of Tumorigenesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 1, January 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The occurrence of aerobic glycolysis based on nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)&#8208;induced enhancement of fluorescence emitted by nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon dots is revealed by a new strategy. This can be used to monitor the occurrence of tumorigenesis and provide an early warning of tumor formation with high accuracy and specificity.








Abstract
Early warning of tumor formation is crucial for the classification, treatment, and prognosis of tumor patients. Here, a new strategy is reported, aimed at realizing this goal based on imaging aerobic glycolysis processes using nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon dots (N&#8208;CDs) as fluorescent probes. The intensity of the photoluminescence emitted by the N&#8208;CDs is specifically enhanced by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+, oxidized) in the physiological environment. The N&#8208;CDs allow a few (five to ten) abnormal cells in spontaneous hepatocellular carcinoma models to be identified before the in situ development of tumor tissue. The N&#8208;CD probes can also distinguish tumor cells from normal cells and be used to evaluate their proliferation activity (with a specificity of up to 96.15% in 13 types of tumor cells and 90.90% in orthotopic xenograft models). The N&#8208;CDs are successfully used to monitor the invasion of tumor cells into neighboring tissues and body fluids in 49 clinical samples (with a sensitivity up to 79.31%). These included three vitreous body samples (from patients with retinoblastoma), 42 urine samples (22 patients clinically diagnosed with urothelium carcinoma and 20 healthy persons), and four hydrothorax samples (from patients with metastatic lesions).

This can be used to monitor the occurrence of tumorigenesis and provide an early warning of tumor formation with high accuracy and specificity.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early warning of tumor formation is crucial for the classification, treatment, and prognosis of tumor patients. Here, a new strategy is reported, aimed at realizing this goal based on imaging aerobic glycolysis processes using nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon dots (N&#8208;CDs) as fluorescent probes. The intensity of the photoluminescence emitted by the N&#8208;CDs is specifically enhanced by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, oxidized) in the physiological environment. The N&#8208;CDs allow a few (five to ten) abnormal cells in spontaneous hepatocellular carcinoma models to be identified before the in situ development of tumor tissue. The N&#8208;CD probes can also distinguish tumor cells from normal cells and be used to evaluate their proliferation activity (with a specificity of up to 96.15% in 13 types of tumor cells and 90.90% in orthotopic xenograft models). The N&#8208;CDs are successfully used to monitor the invasion of tumor cells into neighboring tissues and body fluids in 49 clinical samples (with a sensitivity up to 79.31%). These included three vitreous body samples (from patients with retinoblastoma), 42 urine samples (22 patients clinically diagnosed with urothelium carcinoma and 20 healthy persons), and four hydrothorax samples (from patients with metastatic lesions).&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Compositional Fluctuations Locked by Athermal Transformation Yielding High Thermoelectric Performance in GeTe</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 1, January 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interplay between phase decomposition and athermal phase transition is leveraged in a Ge&#8211;Sb&#8211;Te ternary system to enable exquisite microstructure features by strong composition fluctuations and coexistence of rhombohedral and cubic GeTe. Specifically, alloying GeTe with Sb2Te3 significantly suppresses thermal conductivity while retaining eligible carrier concentration over a wide composition range, resulting in high zT values of &gt;2.6.








Abstract
Phase transition in thermoelectric (TE) material is a double&#8208;edged sword&#8212;it is undesired for device operation in applications, but the fluctuations near an electronic instability are favorable. Here, Sb doping is used to elicit a spontaneous composition fluctuation showing uphill diffusion in GeTe that is otherwise suspended by diffusionless athermal cubic&#8208;to&#8208;rhombohedral phase transition at around 700 K. The interplay between these two phase transitions yields exquisite composition fluctuations and a coexistence of cubic and rhombohedral phases in favor of exceptional figures&#8208;of&#8208;merit zT. Specifically, alloying GeTe by Sb2Te3 significantly suppresses the thermal conductivity while retaining eligible carrier concentration over a wide composition range, resulting in high zT values of &gt;2.6. These results not only attest to the efficacy of using phase transition in manipulating the microstructures of GeTe&#8208;based materials but also open up a new thermodynamic route to develop higher performance TE materials in general.

         <title>Manipulating the Solvation Structure of Nonflammable Electrolyte and Interface to Enable Unprecedented Stability of Graphite Anodes beyond 2 Years for Safe Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 1, January 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonflammable electrolytes show great advantages over conventional electrolytes in terms of both safety and performance, exhibiting high compatibility with graphite electrodes with the longest cycling performance (&gt;2 years). The electrolyte structure and derived F&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase jointly contribute to the superlong cycling stability of graphite electrode, which highlights the importance of the electrolyte compatibility and the interface.








Abstract
Potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) are attractive for low&#8208;cost and large&#8208;scale energy storage applications, in which graphite is one of the most promising anodes. However, the large size and the high activity of K+ ions and the highly catalytic surface of graphite largely prevent the development of safe and compatible electrolytes. Here, a nonflammable, moderate&#8208;concentration electrolyte is reported that is highly compatible with graphite anodes and that consists of fire&#8208;retardant trimethyl phosphate (TMP) and potassium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (KFSI) in a salt/solvent molar ratio of 3:8. It shows unprecedented stability, as evidenced by its 74% capacity retention over 24 months of cycling (over 2000 cycles) at the 0.2 C current rate. Electrolyte structure and surface analyses show that this excellent cycling stability is due to the nearly 100% solvation of TMP molecules with K+ cations and the formation of FSI&#8722;&#8208;derived F&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), which effectively suppresses the decomposition of the solvent molecules toward the graphite anode. Furthermore, excellent performance on high&#8208;mass loaded graphite electrodes and in a full cell with perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride cathode is demonstrated. This study highlights the importance of the compatibility of both electrolyte and the interface, and offers new opportunities to design the electrolyte&#8211;SEI nexus for safe and practical PIBs.

         <title>Plant Nanobionic Sensors for Arsenic Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 1, January 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploiting the natural ability of plants to pre&#8208;concentrate and extract arsenite from the below&#8208;ground environment, a living plant nanobionic sensor is engineered for non&#8208;destructive arsenite monitoring. By embedding near&#8208;infrared fluorescent nanosensors within the mesophyll, living plants are converted into environmental sensors for real&#8208;time arsenite detection. This demonstration opens new frontiers for plant&#8208;based sensors in environmental monitoring and food safety research.








Abstract
Arsenic is a highly toxic heavy&#8208;metal pollutant which poses a significant health risk to humans and other ecosystems. In this work, the natural ability of wild&#8208;type plants to pre&#8208;concentrate and extract arsenic from the belowground environment is exploited to engineer plant nanobionic sensors for real&#8208;time arsenic detection. Near&#8208;infrared fluorescent nanosensors are specifically designed for sensitive and selective detection of arsenite. These optical nanosensors are embedded in plant tissues to non&#8208;destructively access and monitor the internal dynamics of arsenic taken up by the plants via the roots. The integration of optical nanosensors with living plants enables the conversion of plants into self&#8208;powered autosamplers of arsenic from their environment. Arsenite detection is demonstrated with three different plant species as nanobionic sensors. Based on an experimentally validated kinetic model, the nanobionic sensor could detect 0.6 and 0.2 ppb levels of arsenic after 7 and 14 days respectively by exploiting the natural ability of Pteris cretica ferns to hyperaccumulate and tolerate exceptionally high level of arsenic. The sensor readout could also be interfaced with portable electronics at a standoff distance, potentially enabling applications in environmental monitoring and agronomic research.

         <title>Guest Encapsulation within Surface&#8208;Adsorbed Self&#8208;Assembled Cages</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 1, January 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The adsorption of two metal&#8211;organic coordination capsules on alumina is quantified and the cages are shown to retain their ability to bind and release a molecular cargo following immobilization. The adsorbed cages are then used to stabilize the reagents of a Diels&#8211;Alder reaction prior to their subsequent release and reaction.








Abstract
Coordination cages encapsulate a wide variety of guests in the solution state. This ability renders them useful for applications such as catalysis and the sequestration of precious materials. A simple and general method for the immobilization of coordination cages on alumina is reported. Cage loadings are quantified via adsorption isotherms and guest displacement assays demonstrate that the adsorbed cages retain the ability to encapsulate and separate guest and non&#8208;guest molecules. Finally, a system of two cages, adsorbed on to different regions of alumina, stabilizes and separates a pair of Diels&#8211;Alder reagents. The addition of a single competitive guest results in the controlled release of the reagents, thus triggering their reaction. This method of coordination cage immobilization on solid phases is envisaged to be applicable to the extensive library of reported cages, enabling new applications based upon selective solid&#8208;phase molecular encapsulation.

         <title>Solution&#8208;Processed Ti3C2Tx MXene Antennas for Radio&#8208;Frequency Communication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 1, January 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
MXene microstrip patch antennas with ultrahigh&#8208;power radiation in a wide frequency range are fabricated by spray&#8208;coating. The radiation efficiency of a 5.5&#160;&#181;m thick MXene patch antenna reaches 99% at 16.4&#160;GHz, which is about the same as that of a 35&#160;&#181;m thick copper patch antenna. MXene outperforms all other materials evaluated for patch antennas to date.








Abstract
Highly integrated, flexible, and ultrathin wireless communication components are in significant demand due to the explosive growth of portable and wearable electronic devices in the fifth&#8208;generation (5G) network era, but only conventional metals meet the requirements for emerging radio&#8208;frequency (RF) devices so far. Here, it is reported on Ti3C2Tx MXene microstrip transmission lines with low&#8208;energy attenuation and patch antennas with high&#8208;power radiation at frequencies from 5.6 to 16.4&#160;GHz. The radiation efficiency of a 5.5&#160;&#181;m thick MXene patch antenna manufactured by spray&#8208;coating from aqueous solution reaches 99% at 16.4&#160;GHz, which is about the same as that of a standard 35&#160;&#181;m thick copper patch antenna at about 15% of its thickness and 7% of the copper weight. MXene outperforms all other materials evaluated for patch antennas to date. Moreover, it is demonstrated that an MXene patch antenna array with integrated feeding circuits on a conformal surface has comparable performance with that of a copper antenna array at 28&#160;GHz, which is a target frequency in practical 5G applications. The versatility of MXene antennas in wide frequency ranges coupled with the flexibility, scalability, and ease of solution processing makes MXene promising for integrated RF components in various flexible electronic devices.

         <title>Fullerene Desymmetrization as a Means to Achieve Single&#8208;Enantiomer Electron Acceptors with Maximized Chiroptical Responsiveness</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 1, January 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The isomeric complexity of a common organic fullerene electron acceptor is resolved, giving ten enantiomeric pairs across six bond types with different chiroptical response. Single&#8208;enantiomer fullerene transistor devices discriminate circularly polarized light with a fast light response and very high photocurrent dissymmetry factor (up to gph&#160;= 1.2&#160;&#177; 0.06).








Abstract
Solubilized fullerene derivatives have revolutionized the development of organic photovoltaic devices, acting as excellent electron acceptors. The addition of solubilizing addends to the fullerene cage results in a large number of isomers, which are generally employed as isomeric mixtures. Moreover, a significant number of these isomers are chiral, which further adds to the isomeric complexity. The opportunities presented by single&#8208;isomer, and particularly single&#8208;enantiomer, fullerenes in organic electronic materials and devices are poorly understood however. Here, ten pairs of enantiomers are separated from the 19 structural isomers of bis[60]phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric acid methyl ester, using them to elucidate important chiroptical relationships and demonstrating their application to a circularly polarized light (CPL)&#8208;detecting device. Larger chiroptical responses are found, occurring through the inherent chirality of the fullerene. When used in a single&#8208;enantiomer organic field&#8208;effect transistor, the potential to discriminate CPL with a fast light response time and with a very high photocurrent dissymmetry factor (gph&#160;= 1.27 &#177; 0.06)&#160;is demonstrated. This study thus provides key strategies to design fullerenes with large chiroptical responses for use as chiral components of organic electronic devices. It is anticipated that this data will position chiral fullerenes as an exciting material class for the growing field of chiral electronic technologies.

         <title>Biomimicking Antibacterial Opto&#8208;Electro Sensing Sutures Made of Regenerated Silk Proteins</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 1, January 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A set of biomimicking, antibacterial, and sensing sutures made of regenerated silk fibroin inspired by natural spider&#8208;silk fibers is presented. These sensing sutures are hierarchically structured and heterogeneously functionalized so as to integrate multiple, clinically favorable functions into one suture device. These functions include reducing inflammation, antibacterial activity, tension measurements, aiding tissue healing, and opto&#8208;electro monitoring.








Abstract
Surgical sutures play an important role across a wide range of medical treatments and a wide variety exist, differing in strength, size, composition, and performance. Recently, increasing interest has been paid to bioactive and electronic sutures made of synthetic polymers, owing to their ability to reduce inflammation as well as medically and/or electronically facilitate wound healing. However, integrating sensing capabilities into bioactive sutures without adversely affecting their mechanical strength, biocompatibility, and/or bioactivity remains challenging. In this work, a set of biomimicking, antibacterial, and sensing sutures based on the regenerated silk fibroin is designed and fabricated. These sensing sutures, inspired by the &#8220;core&#8211;shell&#8221; multilayered structure of natural spider&#8208;silk fibers, are hierarchically structured and heterogeneously functionalized to allow for the integration of multiple, clinically favorable functions into one suture device. These functions included: reducing inflammation and bacterial infection in wound sites, measuring tension of both the tissue and suture, and aiding tissue healing via multi&#8208;modal controlled drug and growth factor release. Critically, these functions are coupled with real&#8208;time optical and electronic monitoring capabilities. This approach provides greater insight into multifunctional sutures with inherent sensing capabilities and offers enormous potential in both therapeutic and diagnostic applications.

         <title>Metasurfaces: Three&#8208;Dimensional Photoengraving of Monolithic, Multifaceted Metasurfaces (Adv. Mater. 1/2021)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 1, January 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metasurfaces are traditionally 2D metamaterials that manipulate light. In article number 2005454, Shu Yang and co&#8208;workers bring them into 3D by photoengraving diverse metasurfaces onto different facets of monolithic, 3D microstructured arrays in a high&#8208;throughput and on demand fashion. By patterning locally confined metasurfaces on a cube, each cube becomes a multiplexing pixel for color reflection and filtering.

The coupling of quasi&#8208;2D perovskite layers is demonstrated by Kai Wang, Rui Chen, Wallace C. H. Choy, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2005570. Their results show that a bifunctional ligand can simultaneously diminish the weak van der Waals gap and passivate perovskite defects for efficient energy transfer and radiative recombination. They fabricate blue PeLEDs that show high performance with an EQE of 10.11% and a long stability of 81.3 min.

         <title>Chiral Materials: Fullerene Desymmetrization as a Means to Achieve Single&#8208;Enantiomer Electron Acceptors with Maximized Chiroptical Responsiveness (Adv. Mater. 1/2021)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 1, January 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solubilized fullerene derivatives have revolutionized the development of organic photovoltaic devices, but the isomeric complexity that arises from addition of the solubilizing group is often ignored. In article number 2004115, Matthew J. Fuchter and co&#8208;workers separate 10 pairs of enantiomers from the 19 structural isomers of a common fullerene acceptor. They demonstrate the potential to discriminate circularly polarized light with a fast light&#8208;response time and with a very high photocurrent dissymmetry factor, enabled by a chiral fullerene.

         <title>Recent Advances in Growth of Large&#8208;Sized 2D Single Crystals on Cu Substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 1, January 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in the growth and production of wafer&#8208;scale and single&#8208;crystal 2D materials on Cu substrates by chemical vapor deposition are presented. The features and roles of Cu in making 2D crystals are comprehensively demonstrated. The daunting quest for mass production of single&#8208;crystal 2D materials poses great potential in electronics and other applications.








Abstract
Large&#8208;scale and high&#8208;quality 2D materials have been an emerging and promising choice for use in modern chemistry and physics owing to their fascinating property profile. The past few years have witnessed inspiringly progressing development in controlled fabrication of large&#8208;sized and single&#8208;crystal 2D materials. Among those production methods, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) has drawn the most attention because of its fine control over size and quality of 2D materials by modulating the growth conditions. Meanwhile, Cu has been widely accepted as the most popular catalyst due to its significant merit in growing monolayer 2D materials in the CVD process. Herein, very recent advances in preparing large&#8208;sized 2D single crystals on Cu substrates by CVD are presented. First, the unique features of Cu will be given in terms of ultralow precursor solubility and feasible surface engineering. Then, scaled growth of graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) crystals on Cu substrates is demonstrated, wherein different kinds of Cu surfaces have been employed. Furthermore, the growth mechanism for the growth of 2D single crystals is exhibited, offering a guideline to elucidate the in&#8208;depth growth dynamics and kinetics. Finally, relevant issues for industrial&#8208;scale mass production of 2D single crystals are discussed and a promising future is expected.

         <title>MXenes for Rechargeable Batteries Beyond the Lithium&#8208;Ion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 1, January 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
MXene and MXene&#8208;based materials are promising for emerging battery technologies beyond lithium&#8208;ion batteries (including alkali&#8208;ion storage, multivalent&#8208;ion storage, and metal batteries). High conductivity, compositional diversity, and rich surface terminations allow MXenes to play various roles in emerging batteries, including as electrodes, metal&#8208;anode protective layers, sulfur hosts, separator interlayers, and conductive additives.








Abstract
Research on next&#8208;generation battery technologies (beyond Li&#8208;ion batteries, or LIBs) has been accelerating over the past few years. A key challenge for these emerging batteries has been the lack of suitable electrode materials, which severely limits their further developments. MXenes, a new class of 2D transition metal carbides, carbonitrides, and nitrides, are proposed as electrode materials for these emerging batteries due to several desirable attributes. These attributes include large and tunable interlayer spaces, excellent hydrophilicity, extraordinary conductivity, compositional diversity, and abundant surface chemistries, making MXenes promising not only as electrode materials but also as other components in the cells of emerging batteries. Herein, an overview and assessment of the utilization of MXenes in rechargeable batteries beyond LIBs, including alkali&#8208;ion (e.g., Na+, K+) storage, multivalent&#8208;ion (e.g., Mg2+, Zn2+, and Al3+) storage, and metal batteries are presented. In particular, the synthetic strategies and properties of MXenes that enable MXenes to play various roles as electrodes, metal anode protective layers, sulfur hosts, separator modification layers, and conductive additives in these emerging batteries are discussed. Moreover, a perspective on promising future research directions on MXenes and MXene&#8208;based materials, ranging from material design and processing, fundamental understanding of the reaction mechanisms, to device performance optimization strategies is provided.

     alt="MXenes for Rechargeable Batteries Beyond the Lithium&#8208;Ion"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MXene and MXene&#8208;based materials are promising for emerging battery technologies beyond lithium&#8208;ion batteries (including alkali&#8208;ion storage, multivalent&#8208;ion storage, and metal batteries). High conductivity, compositional diversity, and rich surface terminations allow MXenes to play various roles in emerging batteries, including as electrodes, metal&#8208;anode protective layers, sulfur hosts, separator interlayers, and conductive additives.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research on next&#8208;generation battery technologies (beyond Li&#8208;ion batteries, or LIBs) has been accelerating over the past few years. A key challenge for these emerging batteries has been the lack of suitable electrode materials, which severely limits their further developments. MXenes, a new class of 2D transition metal carbides, carbonitrides, and nitrides, are proposed as electrode materials for these emerging batteries due to several desirable attributes. These attributes include large and tunable interlayer spaces, excellent hydrophilicity, extraordinary conductivity, compositional diversity, and abundant surface chemistries, making MXenes promising not only as electrode materials but also as other components in the cells of emerging batteries. Herein, an overview and assessment of the utilization of MXenes in rechargeable batteries beyond LIBs, including alkali&#8208;ion (e.g., Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) storage, multivalent&#8208;ion (e.g., Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, and Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;) storage, and metal batteries are presented. In particular, the synthetic strategies and properties of MXenes that enable MXenes to play various roles as electrodes, metal anode protective layers, sulfur hosts, separator modification layers, and conductive additives in these emerging batteries are discussed. Moreover, a perspective on promising future research directions on MXenes and MXene&#8208;based materials, ranging from material design and processing, fundamental understanding of the reaction mechanisms, to device performance optimization strategies is provided.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Review of Piezoelectric and Magnetostrictive Biosensor Materials for Detection of COVID&#8208;19 and Other Viruses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 1, January 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Piezoelectric and magnetostrictive biosensor materials are presented and discussed. It is found that these advanced materials show great potential for application in the detection of various viruses. Progress related to COVID&#8208;19 (coronavirus disease 2019) and the way to new and emerging sensors for virus detection for home application or wearability are considered.








Abstract
The spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus has changed the lives of people around the world with a huge impact on economies and societies. The development of wearable sensors that can continuously monitor the environment for viruses may become an important research area. Here, the state of the art of research on biosensor materials for virus detection is reviewed. A general description of the principles for virus detection is included, along with a critique of the experimental work dedicated to various virus sensors, and a summary of their detection limitations. The piezoelectric sensors used for the detection of human papilloma, vaccinia, dengue, Ebola, influenza A, human immunodeficiency, and hepatitis B viruses are examined in the first section; then the second part deals with magnetostrictive sensors for the detection of bacterial spores, proteins, and classical swine fever. In addition, progress related to early detection of COVID&#8208;19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is discussed in the final section, where remaining challenges in the field are also identified. It is believed that this review will guide material researchers in their future work of developing smart biosensors, which can further improve detection sensitivity in monitoring currently known and future virus threats.

         <title>Layered PtSe2 for Sensing, Photonic, and (Opto&#8208;)Electronic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 1, January 7, 2021. </description>

Layered PtSe2 holds great promise for industries, benefiting from its exciting physical and chemical properties, high air&#8208;stability, and semiconductor&#8208;technology&#8208;compatible fabrication methods. An overview of the use of PtSe2 for applications in photonics, (opto&#8208;)electronics, and sensors is provided. Challenges associated with the synthesis and integration of PtSe2, and the outlook for industry adoption of this material, are discussed.








Abstract
Since the first experimental discovery of graphene 16 years ago, many other 2D layered nanomaterials have been reported. However, the majority of 2D nanostructures suffer from relatively complicated fabrication processes that have bottlenecked their development and their uptake by industry for practical applications. Here, the recent progress in sensing, photonic, and (opto&#8208;)electronic applications of PtSe2, a 2D layered material that is likely to be used in industries benefiting from its high air&#8208;stability and semiconductor&#8208;technology&#8208;compatible fabrication methods, is reviewed. The advantages and disadvantages of a range of synthesis methods for PtSe2 are initially compared, followed by a discussion of its outstanding properties, and industrial and commercial advantages. Research focused on the broadband nonlinear photonic properties of PtSe2, as well as reports of its use as a saturable absorber in ultrafast lasers, are then reviewed. Additionally, the advances that have been achieved in a range of PtSe2&#8208;based field&#8208;effect transistors, photodetectors, and sensors are summarized. Finally, a conclusion on these results along with the outlook for the future is presented.
