         <title>Rare&#8208;Earth (R) In&#8208;Plane Ordering in Novel (Mo, R, Nb)4AlC3 Quinary o&#8208;MAX Nanolaminates and their 2D Derivatives</title>

         <dc:description>
In the history of MAX phase, in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ordered configurations are reported for n = 1 and n &#8805; 2 in Mn+1AlCn separately. Here, starting from the (Mo, Nb)4AlC3 o&#8208;MAX, the novel Mo3.33&#8208;xR0.67NbxAlC3 (R = Y, Gd&#8208;Tm, Lu) super&#8208;ordered (s&#8208;)MAX phase is synthesized with simultaneous R in&#8208;plane&#8208;ordering and Mo/Nb out&#8208;of&#8208;plane&#8208;ordering. The Pt&#8208;anchored 2D s&#8208;MXene shows supreme HER performance.








Abstract
Nanolamellar transition metal carbides are gaining increasing attentions because of the promising application in energy storage of their 2D derivatives. There are in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane atomic ordered occupations, which is thought to only be formed in separated systems due to totally different origins and crystallographic structure. In present work, starting from (Mo, Nb)4AlC3 o&#8208;MAX phase where out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ordered occupation is experimentally and theoretically proved for Mo/Nb atoms, rare&#8208;earth elements (R = Y, Gd&#8208;Tm, Lu) are introduced, and the novel Mo3.33&#8208;xR0.67NbxAlC3 (x = 1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2, 2.25, and 2.5) super&#8208;ordered (s&#8208;) MAX phase is synthesized, where R is ordered at the outer layer in the strict stoichiometry meanwhile Mo/Nb maintains the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ordered occupation. By R introduction, s&#8208;MAX is easier to be delaminated to obtain the s&#8208;MXene with the topochemical ordered vacancies, leading into the enhanced supercapacitance of 114.9 F g&#8722;1 in Mo1.33Nb2C3 s&#8208;MXene compared with 95.1 F g&#8722;1 in Mo2Nb2C3 o&#8208;MXene. By Pt anchoring, very low overpotential of 22&#160;mV at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 is achieved for HER applications. This study demonstrates a novel variety of s&#8208;MAX phase and seeks to inspire further exploration of the ordered MAX and MXene families.

         <title>Homo&#8208;Site Nucleation Growth of Twisted Bilayer MoS2 with Commensurate Angles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal method, the gas&#8208;flow perturbation CVD approach to directly synthesis bilayer MoS2 homostructures with a clean interface and versatile twist angles ranging from 8&#176; to 56&#176; is developed. Enhanced moir&#233; excitons in the twisted bilayer MoS2 with a commensurate angle of 22&#176; are evidenced by using the low&#8208;temperature photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy and density function theory (DFT) calculations.








Abstract
Moir&#233; superlattices, composed of two layers of transition metal dichalcogenides with a relative twist angle, provide a novel platform for exploring the correlated electronic phases and excitonic physics. Here, a gas&#8208;flow perturbation chemical vapor deposition (CVD) approach is demonstrated to directly grow MoS2 bilayer with versatile twist angles. It is found that the formation of twisted bilayer MoS2 homostructures sensitively depends on the gas&#8208;flow perturbation modes, correspondingly featuring the nucleation sites of the second layer at the same (homo&#8208;site) as or at the different (hetero&#8208;site) from that of the first layer. The commensurate twist angle of &#8776;22&#176; in homo&#8208;site nucleation strategy accounts for &#8776;16% among the broad range of twist angles due to its low formation energy, which is in consistence with the theoretical calculation. More importantly, moir&#233; interlayer excitons with the enhanced photoluminescence (PL) intensity and the prolonged lifetime are evidenced in the twisted bilayer MoS2 with a commensurate angle of 22&#176;, which is owing to the reason that the strong moir&#233; potential facilitates the interlayer excitons to be trapped in the moir&#233; superlattices. The work provides a feasible route to controllably built twisted MoS2 homostructures with strong moir&#233; potential to investigate the correlated physics in twistronics systems.

Abstract
Tuberculosis, a fatal infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb), is difficult to treat with antibiotics due to drug resistance and short drug half&#8208;life. Phototherapy represents a promising alternative to antibiotics in combating M.tb. Exploring an intelligent material allowing effective tuberculosis treatment is definitely appealing, yet a significantly challenging task. Herein, an all&#8208;in&#8208;one biomimetic therapeutic nanoparticle featured by aggregation&#8208;induced second near&#8208;infrared emission, granuloma&#8208;targeting, and self&#8208;oxygenation is constructed, which can serve for prominent fluorescence imaging&#8208;navigated combined phototherapy toward tuberculosis. After camouflaging the biomimetic erythrocyte membrane, the nanoparticles show significantly prolonged blood circulation and increased selective accumulation in tuberculosis granuloma. Upon laser irradiation, the loading photosensitizer of aggregation&#8208;induced emission photosensitizer elevates the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), causing M.tb damage and death. The delivery of oxygen to relieve the hypoxic granuloma microenvironment supports ROS generation during photodynamic therapy. Meanwhile, the photothermal agent, Prussian blue nanoparticles, plays the role of good photothermal killing effect on M.tb. Moreover, the growth and proliferation of granuloma and M.tb colonies are effectively inhibited in the nanoparticle&#8208;treated tuberculous granuloma model mice, suggesting the combined therapeutic effects of enhancing photodynamic therapy and photothermal therapy.

         <title>Inducing One&#8208;Step Dehydrogenation of Magnesium Borohydride via Confinement in Robust Dodecahedral Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Porous Carbon Scaffold</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dodecahedral activated N&#8208;doped porous carbon scaffold is synthesized and used for the nanoconfinement of Mg(BH4)2. Precise activation control enables a transformation from microporous carbon materials to mesoporous ones with extremely high specific surface area and pore volume, and hence the efficient nanoconfinement of Mg(BH4)2, realization of one&#8208;step dehydrogenation and superior reversibility.








Abstract
A dodecahedral activated N&#8208;doped porous carbon scaffold is synthesized and used for the nanoconfinement of Mg(BH4)2. The optimized mesoporous scaffold possesses an accumulated pore width of 2.65&#160;nm, high specific surface area (3955.9 m2&#160;g&#8722;1), and large pore volume (2.15 cm3&#160;g&#8722;1), providing ample space for the confinement of Mg(BH4)2 particles and numerous surface active sites for interactions with the same. The confined Mg(BH4)2 system features a dehydrogenation onset temperature of 81.5&#160;&#176;C, an extremely high capacity of 10.2 wt% H2, and an almost single&#8208;step dehydrogenation profile. Moreover, the system exhibits superior capacity retention of 82.7% after 20 cycles at a moderate temperature of 250&#160;&#176;C.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A dodecahedral activated N-doped porous carbon scaffold is synthesized and used for the nanoconfinement of Mg(BH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The optimized mesoporous scaffold possesses an accumulated pore width of 2.65&#160;nm, high specific surface area (3955.9 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), and large pore volume (2.15 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), providing ample space for the confinement of Mg(BH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; particles and numerous surface active sites for interactions with the same. The confined Mg(BH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; system features a dehydrogenation onset temperature of 81.5&#160;&#176;C, an extremely high capacity of 10.2 wt% H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and an almost single-step dehydrogenation profile. Moreover, the system exhibits superior capacity retention of 82.7% after 20 cycles at a moderate temperature of 250&#160;&#176;C. Precise activation control enables a transformation from microporous carbon materials to mesoporous ones, and hence the efficient nanoconfinement of Mg(BH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and realization of one-step dehydrogenation.

         <title>Interstitial Boron Atoms in Pd Aerogel Selectively Switch the Pathway for Glycolic Acid Synthesis from Waste Plastics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PdB alloy aerogel is synthesized as an anode catalyst for selective EG&#8208;to&#8208;GA conversion, achieving a peak mass activity of 6.71 A mgPd&#8722;1 and GA Faraday efficiency of 93.8%. In situ experiments and density functional theory calculations uncover the ligand effect and oxophilicity enhancement originating from B incorporation synergistically regulate the adsorption and conversion of key intermediates, thereby allowing the highly effective EG&#8208;to&#8208;GA conversion.








Abstract
Electro&#8208;reforming of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) into valuable chemicals is garnering significant attention as it opens a mild avenue for waste resource utilization. However, achieving high activity and selectivity for valuable C2 products during ethylene glycol (EG) oxidation in PET hydrolysate on Pd electrocatalysts remains challenging. The strong interaction between Pd and carbonyl (*CO) intermediates leads to undesirable over&#8208;oxidation and poisoning of Pd sites, which hinders the highly efficient C2 products production. Herein, a nonmetallic alloying strategy is employed to fabricate a Pd&#8208;boron alloy aerogel (PdB), wherein B atoms are induced to regulate the electron structure and surface oxophilicity. This approach allows a remarkable mass activity of 6.71 A mgPd&#8722;1, glycolic acid (GA) Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 93.8%, and stable 100 h cyclic electrolysis. In situ experiments and density functional theory calculations reveal the contributions of B inserted in Pd lattice on highly effective EG&#8208;to&#8208;GA conversion. Interestingly, the heightened surface oxophilicity and regulated electronic structure by B incorporation weakened *CO intermediates adsorption and enhanced hydroxyl species affinity to accelerate oxidative *OH adspecies formation, thereby synergistically avoiding over&#8208;oxidation and boosting GA synthesis. This work provides valuable insights for the rational design of high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts for GA synthesis via an oxophilic B motifs incorporation strategy.

         <title>Fully Degradable Polyphosphoester Cubosomes for Sustainable Agrochemical Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The urgent need to address microplastic pollution and promote sustainable agriculture has driven the development of fully degradable carriers for agrochemicals. A novel self&#8208;assembly method is introduced to produce porous polymer cubosomes (PCs), which are mesoporous (2&#8211;50 nm), and loaded with fungicides for effective release. These PCs show high antimycotic activity, adhere to leaves despite rain, and fully degrade into non&#8208;toxic byproducts, offering a promising solution for microplastic&#8208;free agrochemical delivery.








Abstract
Microplastic pollution and the urgent need for sustainable agriculture have raised interest in developing degradable carriers for controlled agrochemical release. Porous polymeric particles are particularly promising due to their unique release profiles compared to solid or core&#8208;shell carriers. However, creating degradable, mesoporous (2&#8211;50 nm) microparticles is challenging, and their potential for agrochemical delivery is largely unexplored.
A straightforward self&#8208;assembly method is demonstrated for fully degradable porous polymer cubosomes (PCs), showcasing their ability to load and release agrochemicals. Using fully degradable block copolymers (BCPs), poly(ethyl ethylene phosphate)&#8208;b&#8208;polylactide (PEEP&#8208;b&#8208;PLA), PCs are synthesized in water with high inner order and open pores averaging 19 &#177; 3 nm in diameter. During the self&#8208;assembly process in the presence of the hydrophobic fungicide tebuconazole, polymersomes transform into PCs by enriching the hydrophobic polymer domain and altering the BCP packing parameter. After self&#8208;assemby, highly porous and fungicide&#8208;loaded PCs are obtained.
Fungicide&#8208;loaded PCs show high antimycotic activity against Botrytis cinerea (grey mold), adhere to Vitis vinifera Riesling leaves even after simulated rain, and release the fungicide continuously over several days with different release&#8208;kinetics compared to solid particles. PCs hydrolyze completely into lactic acid and phosphate derivatives, highlighting their potential as microplastic&#8208;free agrochemical delivery systems for sustainable agriculture.

         <title>Injectable and Sprayable Fluorescent Nanoprobe for Rapid Real&#8208;Time Detection of Human Colorectal Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rational design of nanoprobes for colorectal cancer imaging agents is carried out by developing Poly&#8208;g&#8208;BAT with a superior tumor&#8208;to&#8208;normal ratio (up to 12.3) and fast visualization (3&#160;min after in situ spraying), thus enabling successful recognition of the tumor boundary. This work has demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach as a promising strategy in image&#8208;guided tumor resection.









Abstract
The development of minimally invasive surgery has greatly advanced precision tumor surgery, but sometime suffers from restricted visualization of the surgical field, especially during the removal of abdominal tumors. A 3&#8208;D inspection of tumors could be achieved by intravenously injecting tumor&#8208;selective fluorescent probes, whereas most of which are unable to instantly distinguish tumors via in situ spraying, which is urgently needed in the process of surgery in a convenient manner. In this study, this work has designed an injectable and sprayable fluorescent nanoprobe, termed Poly&#8208;g&#8208;BAT, to realize rapid tumor imaging in freshly dissected human colorectal tumors and animal models. Mechanistically, the incorporation of &#947;&#8208;glutamyl group facilitates the rapid internalization of Poly&#8208;g&#8208;BAT, and these internalized nanoprobes can be subsequently activated by intracellular NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase&#8208;1 to release near&#8208;infrared fluorophores. As a result, Poly&#8208;g&#8208;BAT can achieve a superior tumor&#8208;to&#8208;normal ratio (TNR) up to 12.3 and enable a fast visualization (3&#160;min after in situ spraying) of tumor boundaries in the xenograft tumor models, Apcmin/+ mice models and fresh human tumor tissues. In addition, Poly&#8208;g&#8208;BAT is capable of identifying minimal premalignant lesions via intravenous injection.

         <title>Manipulation of Oxidation States on Phase Boundary via Surface Layer Modification for Enhanced Alkaline Hydrogen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterostructure of crystalline Ni4W and amorphous WOx is constructed through a phase engineering strategy. The oxidation state of W in WOx is adjusted to optimize the phase boundary properties with enhanced intrinsic activity for alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction process. This advancement is supported by operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and theoretical analysis, offering insights for designing more effective catalysts.








Abstract
In alkaline water electrolysis and anion exchange membrane water electrolysis technologies, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode is significantly constrained by a high energy barrier during the water dissociation step. This study employs a phase engineering strategy to construct heterostructures composed of crystalline Ni4W and amorphous WOx aiming to enhance catalytic performance in the HER under alkaline conditions. This work systematically modulates the oxidation states of W within the amorphous WOx of the heterostructure to adjust the electronic states of the phase boundary, the energy barriers associated with the water dissociation step, and the adsorption/desorption properties of intermediates during the alkaline HER process. The optimized catalyst, Ni4W/WOx&#8208;2, with a quasi&#8208;metallic state of W coordinated by a low oxygen content in amorphous WOx, demonstrates exceptional catalytic performance (22 mV@10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2), outperforming commercial Pt/C (30 mV@10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2). Furthermore, the operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy analysis and theoretical calculations reveal that the optimized W atoms in amorphous WOx serve as active sites for water dissociation and the nearby Ni atoms in crystalline Ni4W facilitated the release of H2. These findings provide valuable insights into designing efficient heterostructured materials for energy conversion.

The optimized catalyst, Ni&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;W/WO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;-2, with a quasi-metallic state of W coordinated by a low oxygen content in amorphous WO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, demonstrates exceptional catalytic performance (22 mV@10&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), outperforming commercial Pt/C (30 mV@10&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Furthermore, the operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy analysis and theoretical calculations reveal that the optimized W atoms in amorphous WO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; serve as active sites for water dissociation and the nearby Ni atoms in crystalline Ni&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;W facilitated the release of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. These findings provide valuable insights into designing efficient heterostructured materials for energy conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Computational Simulations of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks to Enhance Adsorption Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights the significance of molecular simulations in expanding the understanding of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and improving their gas adsorption applications. The historical development and implementation of molecular simulations in the MOF field are given, high&#8208;throughput computational screening studies used to unlock the potential of MOFs in CO2 capture, CH4 storage, H2 storage, and water harvesting are discussed.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), renowned for their exceptional porosity and crystalline structure, stand at the forefront of gas adsorption and separation applications. Shortly after their discovery through experimental synthesis, computational simulations quickly become an important method in broadening the use of MOFs by offering deep insights into their structural, functional, and performance properties. This review specifically addresses the pivotal role of molecular simulations in enlarging the molecular understanding of MOFs and enhancing their applications, particularly for gas adsorption. After reviewing the historical development and implementation of molecular simulation methods in the field of MOFs, high&#8208;throughput computational screening (HTCS) studies used to unlock the potential of MOFs in CO2 capture, CH4 storage, H2 storage, and water harvesting are visited and recent advancements in these adsorption applications are highlighted. The transformative impact of integrating artificial intelligence with HTCS on the prediction of MOFs&#8217; performance and directing the experimental efforts on promising materials is addressed. An outlook on current opportunities and challenges in the field to accelerate the adsorption applications of MOFs is finally provided.

         <title>Extracting Geometry and Topology of Orange Pericarps for the Design of Bioinspired Energy Absorbing Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired material design method is presented to imitate the irregular structure of biological materials and obtain their outstanding mechanical properties. Rather than replicating the biological structure one&#8208;to&#8208;one, the method identifies distributions of fundamental building blocks and connectivity rules and generates synthetic equivalents with the same distributions. The method is demonstrated using the orange pericarp, known for protective, energy&#8208;absorbing capabilities.








Abstract
As a result of evolution, many biological materials have developed irregular structures that lead to outstanding mechanical performances, like high stiffness&#8208;to&#8208;weight ratios and good energy absorption. However, reproducing these irregular biological structures in synthetic materials remains a complex design and fabrication challenge. Here, a bioinspired material design method is presented that characterizes the irregular structure as a network of building blocks, also known as tiles, and rules to connect them. Rather than replicating the biological structure one&#8208;to&#8208;one, synthetic materials are generated with the same distributions of tiles and connectivity rules as the biological material and it is shown that these equivalent materials have structure&#8208;to&#8208;property relationships similar to the biological ones. To demonstrate the method, the pericarp of the orange, a member of the citrus family known for its protective, energy&#8208;absorbing capabilities is studied. Polymer samples are generated and characterized under quasistatic and dynamic compression and display spatially&#8208;varying stiffness and good energy absorption, as seen in the biological materials. By quantifying which tiles and connectivity rules locally deform in response to loading, it is also determined how to spatially control the stiffness and energy absorption.

         <title>Acetonitrile&#8208;Based Local High&#8208;Concentration Electrolytes for Advanced Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The compatibility issue of acetonitrile (AN) with lithium metal is tackled by introducing a novel approach&#8212;a locally high&#8208;concentration electrolyte (LHCE) using 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethyl&#8208;2,2,3,3&#8208;tetrafluoropropyl ether (TTE) as a diluent (LAT&#8208;0.5:1:2). The electrolyte demonstrates exceptional electrochemical stability, flame retardancy, and wettability. Based on Cryo&#8208;EM characterization and theoretical simulations, the underlying mechanism of the AN&#8208;based LHCE from both the respects of solvation and SEI structures has been revealed.








Abstract
Acetonitrile (AN) is a compelling electrolyte solvent for high&#8208;voltage and fast&#8208;charging batteries, but its reductive instability makes it incompatible with lithium metal anodes (LMAs). Herein, 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethyl&#8208;2,2,3,3&#8208;tetrafluoropropyl ether (TTE) is used as the diluent to build an AN&#8208;based local high&#8208;concentration electrolyte (LHCE) to realize dense, dendrite&#8208;free, and stable LMAs. Such LHCE exhibits an exceptional electrochemical stability window close to 6&#160;V (vs Li+/Li), excellent wettability, and promising flame retardancy. Compared to a baseline carbonate&#8208;based electrolyte, its electrochemical performance is prominent: the overpotential of lithium nucleation is minimal (only 24&#160;mV), the average half&#8208;cell coulombic efficiency (CE) reaches 99.5% at 0.5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, and its practicality in full cells with LiFePO4 (LFP) and LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) cathodes is also demonstrated. Compounding factors are identified to decipher the superiority of the AN&#8208;based LHCE. From the respect of solvation structures, both the elimination of free AN molecule and the diluent separation would contribute to prevention of anodic AN decomposition. Based on cryogenic electron microscopy (Cryo&#8208;EM) characterization and theoretical simulations results, the produced solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer is uniform and compact. Thus, this work demonstrates a successful application of AN&#8208;based electrolytes in LMAs&#8212;traditionally deemed impractical&#8212;via the combined regulation of solvation and SEI structures.

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Like Surfaces with Enhanced De&#8208;Wettability and Durability: From Structural Designs to Potential Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid&#8208;like surfaces with repellency have shown great potential in the fields of biology, environment, energy, and catalysis. However, they currently encounter challenges in superior de&#8208;wettability and durability. This review summarizes the recent progress of LLSs with enhanced de&#8208;wettability and durability via novel structural designs. Furthermore, potential applications of LLSs with enhanced de&#8208;wettability and durability are reviewed.








Abstract
Liquid&#8208;like surfaces (LLSs) with dynamic repellency toward various pollutants (e.g., bacteria, oil, and ice), have shown enormous potential in the fields of biology, environment, and energy. However, most of the reported LLSs cannot meet the demands for practical applications, particularly in terms of de&#8208;wettability and durability. To solve these problems, considerable progress has been made in enhancing the de&#8208;wettability and durability of LLSs in complex environments. Therefore, this review mainly focuses on the recent progress in LLSs, encompassing designed structures and repellent capabilities, as well as their diverse applications, offering greater insights for the targeted design of desired LLSs. First, a detailed overview of the development of LLSs from the perspective of their molecular structural evolution is provided. Then highlight recent approaches for enhancing the dynamic de&#8208;wettability and durability of LLSs by optimizing their structural designs, including linear, looped, crosslinked, and hybrid structures. Later, the diverse applications and unique advantages of recently developed LLSs, including repellency (e.g., liquid anti&#8208;adhesion/transportation/condensation, anti&#8208;icing/scaling/waxing, and biofouling repellency) are summarized. Finally, Perspectives on potential innovative advancements and the promotion of technology selection to advance this exciting field are offered.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Perovskite Solar Cells with Improved Interfacial Charge Extraction by Bridging Molecules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bridging molecule, (2&#8208;aminoethyl)phosphonic acid (AEP), is utilized to modify the buried SnO2/perovskite interface in PSCs. The dual functionality of AEP with adjacent interface leads to significant benefits such as defects suppression, increased film quality, and interfacial charge extraction improvement. A power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.40% (certified at 25.98%) is achieved with &#8776;1400 h operational durability.








Abstract
The interface between the perovskite layer and electron transporting layer is a critical determinate for the performance and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The heterogeneity of the interface critically affects the carrier dynamics at the buried interface. To address this, a bridging molecule, (2&#8208;aminoethyl)phosphonic acid (AEP), is introduced for the modification of SnO2/perovskite buried interface in n&#8211;i&#8211;p structure PSCs. The phosphonic acid group strongly bonds to the SnO2 surface, effectively suppressing the surface carrier traps and leakage current, and uniforming the surface potential. Meanwhile, the amino group influences the growth of perovskite film, resulting in higher crystallinity, phase purity, and fewer defects. Furthermore, the bridging molecules facilitate the charge extraction at the interface, as indicated by the femtosecond transient reflection (fs&#8208;TR) spectroscopy, leading to champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.40% (certified 25.98%) for PSCs. Additionally, the strengthened interface enables improved operational durability of &#8776;1400 h for the unencapsulated PSCs under ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;1I protocol.

         <title>Unveiling Gating Behavior in Piezoionic Effect: toward Neuromimetic Tactile Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Piezoionic hydrogels hold the potential to enable direct ionic gating of transistors. This research reveals that these hydrogels can exhibit gating behavior in response to mechanical stimuli, an analog to the mechanically gated phenomena observed in biological neurons. This breakthrough not only advances neuromimetic pressure sensors but also enhances fundamental understanding of the piezoionic mechanism.








Abstract
The human perception system's information processing is intricately linked to the nonlinear response and gating effect of neurons. While piezoionics holds potential in emulating the pressure sensing capability of biological skin, the incorporation of information processing functions seems neglected. Here, ionic gating behavior in piezoionic hydrogels is uncovered as a notable extension beyond the previously observed linear responses. The hydrogel can generate remarkably high voltages (700&#160;mV) and currents (7&#160;mA) when indentation forces surpass the threshold. Through a comprehensive analysis involving simulations and experimental investigations, it is proposed that the gating behavior emerges due to significant diffusion differences between cations and anions. To showcase the practical implications of this breakthrough, the piezoionic hydrogels are successfully integrated with prostheses and robot hands, demonstrating that the gating effect enables accurate discrimination between gentle and harsh touch. The advancement in neuromimetic tactile sensing has significant potential for emerging applications such as humanoid robotics and biomedical engineering, offering valuable opportunities for further development of embodied neuromorphic intelligence.

         <title>Interstitial Optical Fiber&#8208;Mediated Multimodal Phototheranostics Based on an Aggregation&#8208;Induced NIR&#8208;II Emission Luminogen for Orthotopic Breast Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated strategy combining one&#8208;for&#8208;all phototheranostic molecules with a modified optical fiber is developed to efficiently implement both second near&#8208;infrared fluorescence&#8208;photoacoustic&#8208;photothermal trimodal imaging and &#8220;inside&#8208;out&#8221; irradiation&#8208;triggered phototherapy for orthotopic breast tumors. Histological analysis results demonstrate thorough and complete tumor damage induced by the optical fiber&#8208;mediated phototherapy, in sharp contrast to the shallow treatment effect in a conventional manner.








Abstract
One&#8208;for&#8208;all phototheranostics based on a single molecule is recognized as a convenient approach for cancer treatment, whose efficacy relies on precise lesion localization through multimodal imaging, coupled with the efficient exertion of phototherapy. To unleash the full potential of phototheranostics, advancement in both phototheranostic agents and light delivery methods is essential. Herein, an integrated strategy combining a versatile molecule featuring aggregation&#8208;induced emission, namely tBuTTBD, with a modified optical fiber to realize comprehensive tumor diagnosis and &#8220;inside&#8208;out&#8221; irradiation in the orthotopic breast tumor, is proposed for the first time. Attributed to the intense donor&#8208;acceptor interaction, highly distorted conformation, abundant molecular rotors, and loose intermolecular packing upon aggregation, tBuTTBD can synchronously undergo second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) fluorescence emission, photothermal and photodynamic generation under laser irradiation, contributing to a trimodal NIR&#8208;II fluorescence&#8208;photoacoustic (PA)&#8208;photothermal imaging&#8208;guided phototherapy. The tumor treatment is further carried out following the insertion of a modified optical fiber, which is fabricated by splicing a flat&#8208;end fiber with an air&#8208;core fiber. This configuration aims to enable effective in situ phototherapy by maximizing energy utilization for therapeutic benefits. This work not only enriches the palette of NIR&#8208;II phototheranostic agents but also provides valuable insight for exploring an integrated phototheranostic protocol for practical cancer treatment.

         <title>Intratumoral Microbiota as a Target for Advanced Cancer Therapeutics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the distribution and function of bacteria within tumors, highlighting their significance in cancer development and treatment.








Abstract
In recent years, advancements in microbial sequencing technology have sparked an increasing interest in the bacteria residing within solid tumors and its distribution and functions in various tumors. Intratumoral bacteria critically modulate tumor oncogenesis and development through DNA damage induction, chronic inflammation, epigenetic alterations, and metabolic and immune regulation, while also influencing cancer treatment efficacy by affecting drug metabolism. In response to these discoveries, a variety of anti&#8208;cancer therapies targeting these microorganisms have emerged. These approaches encompass oncolytic therapy utilizing tumor&#8208;associated bacteria, the design of biomaterials based on intratumoral bacteria, the use of intratumoral bacterial components for drug delivery systems, and comprehensive strategies aimed at the eradication of tumor&#8208;promoting bacteria. Herein, this review article summarizes the distribution patterns of bacteria in different solid tumors, examines their impact on tumors, and evaluates current therapeutic strategies centered on tumor&#8208;associated bacteria. Furthermore, the challenges and prospects for developing drugs that target these bacterial communities are also explored, promising new directions for cancer treatment.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Locked WS2 Vortex Emission via Photonic Crystal Bound States in the Continuum</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The symmetry&#8208;protected bound states in the continuum in the SiNx PhC slabs engender azimuthal polarization field in the momentum space, which strongly interacts with the exciton emission from 1L WS2. Consequently, spin&#8208;dependent twisted spiral phase fronts are imposed on the exciton emission from 1L WS2, exhibiting helical wavefronts and doughnut&#8208;shaped intensity beam profiles in the momentum space.









Abstract
Owing to their strong exciton effects and valley polarization properties, monolayer transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides (1L TMDs) have unfolded the prospects of spin&#8208;polarized light&#8208;emitting devices. However, the wavefront control of exciton emission, which is critical to generate structured optical fields, remains elusive. In this work, the experimental demonstration of spin&#8208;locked vortex emission from monolayer Tungsten Disulfide (1L WS2) integrated with Silicon Nitride (SiNx) PhC slabs is presented. The symmetry&#8208;protected bound states in the continuum (BIC) in the SiNx PhC slabs engender azimuthal polarization field distribution in the momentum space with a topological singularity in the center of the Brillouin zone, which imposes the resonantly enhanced WS2 exciton emission with a spin&#8208;correlated spiral phase front by taking advantage of the winding topologies of resonances with the assistance of geometric phase scheme. As a result, exciton emission from 1L WS2 exhibits helical wavefront and doughnut&#8208;shaped intensity beam profile in the momentum space with topological charges locked to the spins of light. This strategy on spin&#8208;dependent excitonic vortex emission may offer the unparalleled capability of valley&#8208;polarized structured light generation for 1L TMDs.

         <title>Breaking the Saturation of Sensitivity for Ultrawide Range Flexible Pressure Sensors by Soft&#8208;Strain Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy for pressure sensing is demonstrated for breaking through the saturation of electrical responses and sensitivity. The strain&#8208;effect&#8208;based pressure sensors can generate increased resistance changes with tensile strain of conductive films over an overwide linear detection range (over 1.5 MPa), and obtain unsaturated electrical response changes&#160;over 100% (from 5.22&#8211;70 MPa&#8722;1).








Abstract
The flexible pressure sensors with a broad pressure range and unsaturated sensitivity are highly desired in practical applications. However, pressure sensors by piezoresistive effect are always limited by the compressibility of sensing layers, resulting in a theoretically decreasing sensitivity of less than 100%. Here, a unique strategy is proposed that utilizes the strain effect, simultaneously achieving a trade&#8208;off between a wider pressure detection range and unsaturated sensitivity. Ascribed to the strain effect of sensing layers induced by interlaced microdomes, the sensors possess an increased sensitivity (5.22&#8211;70 MPa&#8722;1) over an ultrawide pressure range (45 Pa&#8211;4.1 MPa), a high&#8208;pressure resolution (5 Pa), fast response/recovery time (30/45 ms), and a robust response under a high&#8208;pressure loading of 3.5 MPa for more than 5000 cycles.

&lt;p&gt;A novel strategy for pressure sensing is demonstrated for breaking through the saturation of electrical responses and sensitivity. The strain-effect-based pressure sensors can generate increased resistance changes with tensile strain of conductive films over an overwide linear detection range (over 1.5 MPa), and obtain unsaturated electrical response changes&#160;over 100% (from 5.22&#8211;70 MPa&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flexible pressure sensors with a broad pressure range and unsaturated sensitivity are highly desired in practical applications. However, pressure sensors by piezoresistive effect are always limited by the compressibility of sensing layers, resulting in a theoretically decreasing sensitivity of less than 100%. Here, a unique strategy is proposed that utilizes the strain effect, simultaneously achieving a trade-off between a wider pressure detection range and unsaturated sensitivity.

         <title>In Situ Multi&#8208;Directional Liquid Manipulation Enabled by 3D Asymmetric Fang&#8208;Structured Surface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The carefully designed fang&#8208;structured surface generates a unique distributed 3D multi&#8208;curvature, yielding a response to liquid surface tension for customized control of multi&#8208;directional liquid spreading. This enables innovative functions beyond conventional surfaces, including constructing selective multi&#8208;path circuits, portably indicating surface tensions of wetting liquids with a resolution of 0.3&#8211;3.4&#160;mN&#160;m&#8722;1, and temperature&#8208;mediated smart manipulation of liquids.








Abstract
Decorating surfaces with wetting gradients or topological structures is a prevailing strategy to control uni&#8208;directional spreading without energy input. However, current methods, limited by fixed design, cannot achieve multi&#8208;directional control of liquids, posing challenges to practical applications. Here, a structured surface composed of arrayed three&#8208;dimensional asymmetric fang&#8208;structured units is reported that enable in situ control of customized multi&#8208;directional spreading for different surface tension liquids, exhibiting five novel modes. This is attributed to bottom&#8208;up distributed multi&#8208;curvature features of surface units, which create varied Laplace pressure gradients to guide the spreading of different&#8208;wettability liquids along specific directions. The surface's capability to respond to liquid properties for multimodal control leads to innovative functions that are absent in conventional structured surfaces. Selective multi&#8208;path circuits can be constructed by taking advantage of rich liquid behaviors with the surface; surface tensions of wetting liquids can be portably indicated with a resolution scope of 0.3&#8211;3.4&#160;mN&#160;m&#8722;1 using the surface; temperature&#8208;mediated change of liquid properties is utilized to smartly manipulate liquid behavior and achieve the spatiotemporal&#8208;controllable targeted cooling of the surface at its heated state. These novel applications open new avenues for developing advanced surfaces for liquid manipulation.

         <title>A Dual Salt/Dual Solvent Electrolyte Enables Ultrahigh Utilization of Zinc Metal Anode for Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual salt/dual solvent electrolyte composed of Zn(BF4)2/Zn(Ac)2 in water/TEGDME (tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether) mixed solvents is designed to stabilize the zinc metal anode. The developed electrolyte with &#8220;inner co&#8208;salt and outer co&#8208;solvent&#8221; synergistic effect enables corrosion&#8208;free zinc anode and fast zinc ion deposition kinetics. The zinc anode reversibility at ultrahigh utilization exceeds the performance recently reported.








Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous zinc&#160;batteries&#160;are promising in next&#8208;generation sustainable energy storage. However, the low zinc (Zn) metal anode reversibility and utilization in aqueous electrolytes due to Zn corrosion and poor Zn2+ deposition kinetics significantly hinder the development of Zn&#8208;ion batteries. Here, a dual salt/dual solvent electrolyte composed of Zn(BF4)2/Zn(Ac)2 in water/TEGDME (tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether) solvents to achieve reversible Zn anode at an ultrahigh depth of discharge (DOD) is developed. An &#8220;inner co&#8208;salt and outer co&#8208;solvent&#8221; synergistic effect in this unique dual salt/dual solvent system is revealed. Experimental results and theoretical calculations provide evidence that the ether co&#8208;solvent inhibits water activity by forming hydrogen bonding with the water and coordination effects with the proton in the outer Zn2+ solvation structure. Meanwhile, the anion of zinc acetate co&#8208;salt enters the inner Zn2+ solvation structure, thereby accelerating the desolvation kinetics. Strikingly, based on the electrolyte design, the zinc anode shows high reversibility at an ultrahigh utilization of 60% DOD with 99.80% Coulombic efficiency and 9.39 mAh cm&#8722;2 high capacity. The results far exceed the performance reported in electrolyte design work recently. The work provides fundamental insights into inner co&#8208;salt and outer co&#8208;solvent synergistic regulation in multifunctional electrolytes for reversible aqueous metal&#8208;ion batteries.

         <dc:description>
Here a &#8220;multi&#8208;color&#8221; hydrogel&#8208;based photoelectrochemical retinomorphic synapse is reported with unique chemical&#8208;ionic&#8208;electrical signaling in an aqueous electrolyte that enables color perception and biomolecule&#8208;mediated synaptic plasticity. The synergy between the color&#8208;tunable hydrogels and Bi2S3 makes possible the color recognition at zero gate voltage. Taking advantage of the versatile biochemistry, the biochemical&#8208;driven reversible photoelectric response of the cone cell is mimicked.









Abstract
Reproducing human visual functions with artificial devices is a long&#8208;standing goal of the neuromorphic domain. However, emulating the chemical language communication of the visual system in fluids remains a grand challenge. Here, a &#8220;multi&#8208;color&#8221; hydrogel&#8208;based photoelectrochemical retinomorphic synapse is reported with unique chemical&#8208;ionic&#8208;electrical signaling in an aqueous electrolyte that enables, e.g., color perception and biomolecule&#8208;mediated synaptic plasticity. Based on the specific enzyme&#8208;catalyzed chromogenic reactions, three multifunctional colored hydrogels are developed, which can not only synergize with the Bi2S3 photogate to recognize the primary colors but also synergize with a given polymeric channel to promote the long&#8208;term memory of the system. A synaptic array is further constructed for sensing color images and biomolecule&#8208;coded information communication. Taking advantage of the versatile biochemistry, the biochemical&#8208;driven reversible photoelectric response of the cone cell is further mimicked. This work introduces rich chemical designs into retinomorphic devices, providing a perspective for replicating the human visual system in fluids.

         <title>Mullite Mineral&#8208;Derived Robust Solid Electrolyte Enables Polyiodide Shuttle&#8208;Free Zinc&#8208;Iodine Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mullite is transformed as high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state electrolyte (Zn&#8208;ML) to address the issues of zinc dendrites, iodine dissolution, and polyiodide shuttle for Zn//AC@I2 batteries. For the Zn anode, Zn&#8208;ML electrolyte eliminates the side reactions and guides the uniform zinc deposition behavior. For the AC@I2 cathode, Zn&#8208;ML electrolyte minimizes the active iodine dissolution and inhibits the polyiodide shuttle, endowing long&#8208;term cyclic stability.








Abstract
Zinc dendrite, active iodine dissolution, and polyiodide shuttle caused by the strong interaction between liquid electrolyte and solid electrode are the chief culprits for the capacity attenuation of aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine batteries (ZIBs). Herein, mullite is adopted as raw material to prepare Zn&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolyte (Zn&#8208;ML) for ZIBs through zinc ion exchange strategy. Owing to the merits of low electronic conductivity, low zinc diffusion energy barrier, and strong polyiodide adsorption capability, Zn&#8208;ML electrolyte can effectively isolate the redox reactions of zinc anode and AC@I2 cathode, guide the reversible zinc deposition behavior, and inhibit the active iodine dissolution as well as polyiodide shuttle during cycling process. As expected, wide operating voltage window of 2.7&#160;V (vs Zn2+/Zn), high Zn2+ transference number of 0.51, and low activation energy barrier of 29.7&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1 can be achieved for the solid&#8208;state Zn//Zn cells. Meanwhile, high reversible capacity of 127.4 and 107.6 mAh g&#8722;1 can be maintained at 0.5 and 1 A g&#8722;1 after 3&#160;000 and 2&#160;100 cycles for the solid&#8208;state Zn//AC@I2 batteries, corresponding to high&#8208;capacity retention ratio of 85.2% and 80.7%, respectively. This study will inspire the development of mineral&#8208;derived solid electrolyte, and facilitate its application in Zn&#8208;based secondary batteries.

Meanwhile, high reversible capacity of 127.4 and 107.6 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; can be maintained at 0.5 and 1 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 3&#160;000 and 2&#160;100 cycles for the solid-state Zn//AC@I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries, corresponding to high-capacity retention ratio of 85.2% and 80.7%, respectively. This study will inspire the development of mineral-derived solid electrolyte, and facilitate its application in Zn-based secondary batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Soft&#8208;Fiber Bioelectronic Device with Axon&#8208;Like Architecture Enables Reliable Neural Recording In Vivo under Vigorous Activities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A soft fiber neural device resembling an axon skeleton with a network&#8208;in&#8208;liquid structure is constructed, having an ideal combination of stretchability, low modulus, low specific impedance, and high electrical conductivity. This fiber neural device can solve the longstanding problem of recording neurons in vivo under vigorous activities even in the deep brain of medium&#8208;sized animals.








Abstract
Implantable neural devices that record neurons in various states, including static states, light activities such as walking, and vigorous activities such as running, offer opportunities for understanding brain functions and dysfunctions. However, recording neurons under vigorous activities remains a long&#8208;standing challenge because it leads to intense brain deformation. Thus, three key requirements are needed simultaneously for neural devices, that is, low modulus, low specific interfacial impedance, and high electrical conductivity, to realize stable device/brain interfaces and high&#8208;quality transmission of neural signals. However, they always contradict each other in current material strategies. Here, a soft fiber neural device capable of stably tracking individual neurons in the deep brain of medium&#8208;sized animals under vigorous activity is reported. Inspired by the axon architecture, this fiber neural device is constructed with a conductive gel fiber possessing a network&#8208;in&#8208;liquid structure using conjugated polymers and liquid matrices and then insulated with soft fluorine rubber. This strategy reconciles the contradictions and simultaneously confers the fiber neural device with low modulus (300&#160;kPa), low specific impedance (579&#160;k&#937;&#160;&#181;m2), and high electrical conductivity (32&#160;700&#160;S&#160;m&#8722;1) &#8211; &#8776;1&#8211;3 times higher than hydrogels. Stable single&#8208;unit spike tracking in running cats, which promises new opportunities for neuroscience is demonstrated.

         <title>Chiral Co&#8208;Assembly with Narrowband Multi&#8208;Resonance Characteristics for High&#8208;Performance Circularly Polarized Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Promising chiral co&#8208;assemblies featuring CPL amplification are achieved by thermal annealing of assembled host, chiral inducers, and narrowband multi&#8208;resonance acceptor. The CP&#8208;OLEDs based on those co&#8208;assemblies exhibit excellent comprehensive device performance, such as gEL of 0.16, EQEmax of 4.6%, and FWHM of 39 nm, which are the best among all reported CP&#8208;OLEDs.








Abstract
A promising kind of ternary chiral co&#8208;assemblies with high PLQY, large dissymmetry factor (glum), and narrowband multi&#8208;resonance characteristics are achieved by codoped&#8208;thermal annealing treatments of achiral luminescent polymer F8BT, chiral inducers R/S&#8208;5011, and achiral FRET acceptor DBN&#8208;ICZ. The optimized co&#8208;assemblies (F8BT)0.9&#8208;(R/S&#8208;5011)0.1&#8208;(DBN&#8208;ICZ)0.005 display narrowband yellow emission with full&#8208;width half maximum (FWHM) of 37 nm, PLQY of 79%, and intense CPL signals with |glum| of up to 0.26. Meaningfully, solution&#8208;processed CP&#8208;OLEDs by using those ternary chiral co&#8208;assemblies as emitting layer are successfully fabricated, which display yellow circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) with EQEmax of 4.6% and gEL of up to 0.16. The corresponding Q&#8208;factor could reach up to 7.36 &#215; 10&#8722;3, which is the highest of all the reported CP&#8208;OLEDs. Moreover, the devices also exhibit excellent comprehensive device performance with low Von of 7.0 V, high Lmax of about 25&#160;000 cd m&#8722;2, extremely low efficiency roll&#8208;off with EQE of 4.3% at 10&#160;000 cd m&#8722;2, as well as narrowband EL with FWHM of only 39 nm. The proposed ternary co&#8208;assembly strategy in fabricating CP&#8208;OLED provides the possibility to achieve high comprehensive device performance such as balancing high EQE and large gEL value, as well as narrowband emission, high brightness and low efficiency roll&#8208;off simultaneously.

         <title>Superatomic Layer of Cubic Mo4S4 Clusters Connected by Cl Cross&#8208;Linking</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The preparation of Mo8S8Cl11, a superatomic layer with a sandwich structure of cubic Mo4S4 clusters connected by Cl cross&#8208;linking, is reported. This vapor&#8208;phase reaction within nanotubes promotes the selective growth of monolayer Mo8S8Cl11, thereby allowing for comprehensive characterization. This reaction further yields microscopic flakes containing Mo8S8Cl11, which exhibit significant catalytic activity for the hydrogen&#8208;evolution reaction.








Abstract
Superatomic clusters &#8211; assemblies of atoms with various sizes, shapes, and compositions &#8211; can form hierarchical architectures that exhibit emergent electronic properties not found in their individual units. In particular, cubic M4X4 clusters of chalcogenides (M = transition metal; X = chalcogen) are recognized as versatile building blocks for 3D structures with tunable morphologies and electronic properties. However, tetrahedral M4X4 clusters rarely assemble into 2D architectures, which could offer a distinct class of functional materials from their 3D analogues. Here, this work reports the preparation of 2D Mo8S8Cl11, a superatomic layer with a sandwich structure consisting of Mo4S4 clusters interconnected through Cl cross&#8208;linking. The vapor&#8208;phase reaction inside nanotubes promotes the selective growth of Mo8S8Cl11 nanoribbons, allowing detailed characterization via transmission electron microscopy. This methodology can be applied to the growth of layered structures containing Mo8S8Cl11 at the micrometer scale. This work has demonstrated that mono&#8208; and few&#8208;layer Mo8S8Cl11 can be prepared by exfoliation of parent solids. Electronic structure calculations indicate that the 2D monolayer has quasi&#8208;flat bands, giving rise to an indirect&#8208;to&#8208;direct bandgap transition under mechanical strain. Furthermore, scanning electrochemical microscopy reveals the potential of the layered structures as highly efficient catalysts for the hydrogen&#8208;evolution reaction.

         <title>Near Room Temperature Solvothermal Growth of Ferroelectric CsPbBr3 Nanoplatelets with Ultralow Dark Current</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferroelectric CsPbBr3 nanoplatelets with exceptional optical properties and ultralow dark current are synthesized via a near&#8208;room temperature solvothermal method by enhancing precursor solubility in alcohol. These nanoplatelets, with dimensions in the tens of micrometers, show potential for use in advanced optoelectronic devices, including optical switches and ferroelectric photovoltaics, by combining ferroelectricity with the inherent properties of CsPbBr3.








Abstract
CsPbBr3 exhibits outstanding optoelectronic properties and thermal stability, making it a coveted material for detectors, light&#8208;emitting diodes, and solar cells. Despite observations of ferroelectricity in CsPbBr3 quantum dots, synthesizing bulk ferroelectric CsPbBr3 crystals has remained elusive, hindering its potential in next&#8208;generation optoelectronic devices like optical switches and ferroelectric photovoltaics. Here, a breakthrough is reported: a novel solvothermal technique enabling the growth of ferroelectric CsPbBr3 nanoplatelets with lateral dimensions in the tens of micrometers. This represents a significant step toward achieving large&#8208;area ferroelectric CsPbBr3 crystals. Unlike traditional methods, this approach allows for growth and crystallization of CsPbBr3 in alcohol solutions by enhancing precursor solubility. This study confirms the ferroelectric nature of these nanoplatelets using second harmonic generation, electrical characterizations, and piezoresponse force microscopy.

     alt="Near Room Temperature Solvothermal Growth of Ferroelectric CsPbBr3 Nanoplatelets with Ultralow Dark Current"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferroelectric CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanoplatelets with exceptional optical properties and ultralow dark current are synthesized via a near-room temperature solvothermal method by enhancing precursor solubility in alcohol. These nanoplatelets, with dimensions in the tens of micrometers, show potential for use in advanced optoelectronic devices, including optical switches and ferroelectric photovoltaics, by combining ferroelectricity with the inherent properties of CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits outstanding optoelectronic properties and thermal stability, making it a coveted material for detectors, light-emitting diodes, and solar cells. Despite observations of ferroelectricity in CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; quantum dots, synthesizing bulk ferroelectric CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; crystals has remained elusive, hindering its potential in next-generation optoelectronic devices like optical switches and ferroelectric photovoltaics. Here, a breakthrough is reported: a novel solvothermal technique enabling the growth of ferroelectric CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanoplatelets with lateral dimensions in the tens of micrometers. This represents a significant step toward achieving large-area ferroelectric CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; crystals. Unlike traditional methods, this approach allows for growth and crystallization of CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in alcohol solutions by enhancing precursor solubility. This study confirms the ferroelectric nature of these nanoplatelets using second harmonic generation, electrical characterizations, and piezoresponse force microscopy. This work paves the way for utilizing ferroelectric CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in novel optoelectronic devices, significantly expanding the potential of this material and opening doors for further exploration in this exciting field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;powered vehicle&#8208;road integrated electronics (SVRIE) with a multilevel fractal structure is reported to improve the level of vehicle&#8208;road collaborative perception and autonomous driving cars. With the assistance of artificial intelligence models, SVRIE enhances the ability to recognize vehicle motion, road surface, and tire health condition, with a perception accuracy of more than 90%.








Abstract
Collaborative perception between a vehicle and the road has the potential to enhance the limited perception capability of autonomous driving technologies. With this background, self&#8208;powered vehicle&#8208;road integrated electronics (SVRIE) with a multilevel fractal structure is designed to play a dual role, including a SVRIE device integrated into vehicle tires and a SVRIE array embedded into a road surface. The pressure sensing capability and anti&#8208;crosstalk performance of the SVRIE array are characterized separately to validate the feasibility of applying the SVRIE in a cooperative vehicle&#8208;infrastructure system. It is demonstrated that the SVRIE based on the multi&#8208;layered fractal structure exhibits maximum performance in collaborative sensing and interaction between vehicles and road information, such as vehicle motion, road surface condition, and tire life cycle health monitoring. Traditional data analysis methods are often of questionable accuracy. Therefore, a convolutional neural network is used to classify the vehicle and road conditions with accuracy of at least 88.3%. The transfer learning model is constructed to enhance the road surface identification capabilities with 100% accuracy. The accuracies of the vehicle tire motion recognition and tire health monitoring are 97% and 99%, respectively. This work provides new ideas for collaborative perception between vehicles and roadsides.

         <title>Engineered Regenerative Isolated Peripheral Nerve Interface for Targeted Reinnervation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An engineered regenerative isolated peripheral nerve interface (eRIPEN) is developed using 3D bioprinting of myoblasts and skeletal&#8208;muscle&#8208;derived decellularized extracellular matrix bioink, along with direct electrospinning to create a nanofiber membrane envelope for in vivo host nerve implantation. After regenerative peripheral nerve interface (RPNI) surgery, the eRIPEN demonstrates long&#8208;term contractility for skeletal muscle tissue and positive effect on pain alleviation through innervation.








Abstract
A regenerative peripheral nerve interface (RPNI) offers a therapeutic solution for nerve injury through reconstruction of the target muscle. However, implanting a transected peripheral nerve into an autologous skeletal muscle graft in RPNI causes donor&#8208;site morbidity, highlighting the need for tissue&#8208;engineered skeletal muscle constructs. Here, an engineered regenerative isolated peripheral nerve interface (eRIPEN) is developed using 3D skeletal cell printing combined with direct electrospinning to create a nanofiber membrane envelop for host nerve implantation. In this in vivo study, after over 8 months of RPNI surgery, the eRIPEN exhibits a minimum Feret diameter of 15&#8211;20&#160;&#181;m with a cross&#8208;sectional area of 100&#8211;500 &#181;m2, representing the largest distribution of myofibers. Furthermore, neuromuscular junction formation and muscle contraction with a force of &#8776;28 N are observed. Notably, the decreased hypersensitivity to mechanical/thermal stimuli and an improved tibial functional index from &#8722;77 to &#8722;56 are found in the eRIPEN group. The present novel concept of eRIPEN paves the way for the utilization and application of tissue&#8208;engineered constructs in RPNI, ultimately realizing neuroprosthesis control through synaptic connections.

         <title>Ultrafast Laser Processing of 2D Materials: Novel Routes to Advanced Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper explores the cutting&#8208;edge use of ultrafast laser technology to precisely modify 2D materials. It presents a leap from theory to real&#8208;world applications, demonstrating how ultrafast lasers can tailor material properties for advanced devices. This method offers nanometer precision without heat&#8208;related issues, revolutionizing novel electronic, photonic, and sensing devices design, making it a key tool for future innovations.








Abstract
Ultrafast laser processing has emerged as a versatile technique for modifying materials and introducing novel functionalities. Over the past decade, this method has demonstrated remarkable advantages in the manipulation of 2D layered materials, including synthesis, structuring, functionalization, and local patterning. Unlike continuous&#8208;wave and long&#8208;pulsed optical methods, ultrafast lasers offer a solution for thermal heating issues. Nonlinear interactions between ultrafast laser pulses and the atomic lattice of 2D materials substantially influence their chemical and physical properties. This paper highlights the transformative role of ultrafast laser pulses in maskless green technology, enabling subtractive, and additive processes that unveil ways for advanced devices. Utilizing the synergetic effect between the energy states within the atomic layers and ultrafast laser irradiation, it is feasible to achieve unprecedented resolutions down to several nanometers. Recent advancements are discussed in functionalization, doping, atomic reconstruction, phase transformation, and 2D and 3D micro&#8208; and nanopatterning. A forward&#8208;looking perspective on a wide array of applications of 2D materials, along with device fabrication featuring novel physical and chemical properties through direct ultrafast laser writing, is also provided.

         <title>Engineering Large&#8208;Scale Self&#8208;Mineralizing Bone Organoids with Bone Matrix&#8208;Inspired Hydroxyapatite Hybrid Bioinks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This innovative study has introduced a new method for bone regeneration, employing hybrid bioinks inspired by the natural bone matrix to develop large&#8208;scale, self&#8208;mineralizing bone organoids with excellent mechanical properties, capable of extensive in vitro and in vivo cultivation, and multicellular differentiation. It has addressed limitations in mechanical support and extracellular matrix replication, advancing bone tissue engineering.








Abstract
Addressing large bone defects remains a significant challenge owing to the inherent limitations in self&#8208;healing capabilities, resulting in prolonged recovery and suboptimal regeneration. Although current clinical solutions are available, they have notable shortcomings, necessitating more efficacious approaches to bone regeneration. Organoids derived from stem cells show great potential in this field; however, the development of bone organoids has been hindered by specific demands, including the need for robust mechanical support provided by scaffolds and hybrid extracellular matrices (ECM). In this context, bioprinting technologies have emerged as powerful means of replicating the complex architecture of bone tissue. The research focused on the fabrication of a highly intricate bone ECM analog using a novel bioink composed of gelatin methacrylate/alginate methacrylate/hydroxyapatite (GelMA/AlgMA/HAP). Bioprinted scaffolds facilitate the long&#8208;term cultivation and progressive maturation of extensive bioprinted bone organoids, foster multicellular differentiation, and offer valuable insights into the initial stages of bone formation. The intrinsic self&#8208;mineralizing quality of the bioink closely emulates the properties of natural bone, empowering organoids with enhanced bone repair for both in vitro and in vivo applications. This trailblazing investigation propels the field of bone tissue engineering and holds significant promise for its translation into practical applications.

This manuscript presents a physiologically and pathologically adaptive smart nanoparticle for in&#8208;vivo delivery of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). This nanoparticle exhibits the capability to target the injured proximal tubules and demonstrates pH&#8208;responsive disassembly within the acidic microenvironment. Utilizing a low dosage, the nanoparticle effectively prevents acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease through mechanisms involving mitochondria repair and immunomodulation.








Abstract
As a central metabolic molecule, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) can potentially treat acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD); however, its bioavailability is poor due to short half&#8208;life, instability, the deficiency of targeting, and difficulties in transmembrane transport. Here a physiologically adaptive gallic acid&#8208;NAD+ nanoparticle is designed, which has ultrasmall size and pH&#8208;responsiveness, passes through the glomerular filtration membrane to reach injured renal tubules, and efficiently delivers NAD+ into the kidneys. With an effective accumulation in the kidneys, it restores renal function, immune microenvironment homeostasis, and mitochondrial homeostasis of AKI mice via the NAD+&#8208;Sirtuin&#8208;1 axis, and exerts strong antifibrotic effects on the AKI&#8208;to&#8208;CKD transition by inhibiting TGF&#8208;&#946; signaling. It also exhibits excellent stability, biodegradable, and biocompatible properties, ensuring its long&#8208;term safety, practicality, and clinical translational feasibility. The present study shows a potential modality of mitochondrial repair and immunomodulation through nanoagents for the efficient and safe treatment of AKI and CKD.

         <title>A Membrane&#8208;Free Rechargeable Seawater Battery Unlocked by Lattice Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new rechargeable seawater battery that directly utilizes natural seawater as both anolyte and catholyte is successfully constructed. The lattice expansion strategy transforms electrochemically inert anatase TiO2 into a high&#8208;specific&#8208;capacity anode in various aqueous electrolytes. This approach effectively addresses the anode challenge in rechargeable seawater batteries, which opens new perspectives for designing high&#8208;energy and scalable aqueous batteries with seawater.








Abstract
Seawater batteries that directly utilize natural seawater as electrolytes are ideal sustainable aqueous devices with high safety, exceedingly low cost, and environmental friendliness. However, the present seawater batteries are either primary batteries or rechargeable half&#8208;seawater/half&#8208;nonaqueous batteries because of the lack of suitable anode working in seawater. Here, a unique lattice engineering to unlock the electrochemically inert anatase TiO2 anode to be highly active for the reversible uptake of multiple cations (Na+, Mg2+, and Ca2+) in aqueous electrolytes is demonstrated. Density functional theory calculations&#160;further reveal the origin of the unprecedented charge storage behaviors, which can be attributed to the significant reduction of the cations diffusion barrier within the lattice, i.e., from 1.5 to 0.4&#160;eV. As a result, the capacities of anatase TiO2 with 2.4% lattice expansion are &#8776;100 times higher than the routine one in natural seawater, and &#8776;200 times higher in aqueous Na+ electrolyte. The finding will significantly advance aqueous seawater energy storage devices closer to practical applications.

         <title>Plasma Coupled Electrolyte Additive Strategy for Construction of High&#8208;Performance Solid Electrolyte Interphase on Li Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a novel plasma coupled electrolyte additive strategy to construct high&#8208;quality gradient SEI composed of inner inorganic layer (LiBr, Li2CO3) and outer organic layer (LiBr, Li2CO3, organic lithium compounds (OLCs), in which free radicals reaction mechanism and induction mechanism are proposed. The optimized lithium anode shows fast transport kinetics of Li+, strong affinity toward Li+ and good mechanical properties. Accordingly, the cells show much better performance than the counterparts.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance lithium metal anodes are crucial for the development of advanced Li metal batteries. Herein, this work reports a novel plasma coupled electrolyte additive strategy to prepare high&#8208;quality composite solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on Li metal to achieve enhanced performance and stability. With the guidance of calculations, this work selects diethyl dibromomalonate (DB) as an additive to optimize the solvation structure of electrolytes to modify the SEI. Meanwhile, this work groundbreakingly develops DB plasma technology coupled with DB electrolyte additive to construct a combinatorial SEI: inner plasma&#8208;induced SEI layer composed of LiBr and Li2CO3 plus additive&#8208;reduced SEI containing LiBr/Li2CO3/organic lithium compounds as an outer compatible layer. The optimized hybrid SEI has strong affinity toward Li+ and good mechanical properties, thereby inducing horizontal dispersion and uniform deposition of Li+ and keep structure stable. Accordingly, the symmetrical cells exhibit enhanced cycling stability for 1200&#160;h at an overpotential of 23.8&#160;mV with average coulombic efficiency (99.51%). Additionally, the full cells with LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathode deliver a capacity retention of 81.7% after 300 cycles at 0.5 C, and the pouch cell achieves a volumetric specific energy of &#8776;664&#160;Wh L&#8210;1. This work provides new enlightenment on plasma technology for fabrication of advanced metal anodes for energy storage.

         <title>Moir&#233; Engineering of Spin&#8211;Orbit Torque by Twisted WS2 Homobilayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Significant improvements and enhanced gate&#8208;voltage tunability of spin&#8211;orbit torque are achieved in CoFe/Pt films interfaced with WS2/WS2 moir&#233; superlattices. The findings are attributed to the moir&#233; magnetic field&#8208;modulated absorption of spin&#8208;Hall current from Pt through the magnetic proximity effect. This study highlights the potential of moir&#233; physics as a novel building block for the design of advanced spintronic devices.








Abstract
Artificial moir&#233; superlattices created by stacking 2D crystals have emerged as a powerful platform with unprecedented material&#8208;engineering capabilities. While moir&#233; superlattices are reported to host a number of novel quantum states, their potential for spintronic applications remains largely unexplored. Here, the effective manipulation of spin&#8211;orbit torque (SOT) is demonstrated using moir&#233; superlattices in ferromagnetic devices comprised of twisted WS2/WS2 homobilayer (t&#8208;WS2) and CoFe/Pt thin films by altering twisting angle (&#952;) and gate voltage. Notably, a substantial enhancement of up to 44.5% is observed in SOT conductivity at &#952;&#160;&#8776;&#160;8.3&#176;. Furthermore, compared to the WS2 monolayer and untwisted WS2/WS2 bilayers, the moir&#233; superlattices in t&#8208;WS2 enable a greater gate&#8208;voltage tunability of SOT conductivity. These results are related to the generation of the interfacial moir&#233; magnetic field by the real&#8208;space Berry phase in moir&#233; superlattices, which modulates the absorption of the spin&#8208;Hall current arising from Pt through the magnetic proximity effect. This study highlights the moir&#233; physics as a new building block for designing enhanced spintronic devices.

         <dc:description>
A nondestructive crystallographic scanning technique for 2D materials is developed, leveraging sticky&#8208;note&#8208;like van der Waals assembling&#8211;disassembling. This method visualizes the detailed crystallography of each grain within polycrystalline graphene using a single&#8208;atom&#8208;thick single&#8208;crystalline graphene and Raman signals varying dependent on interlayer twist angles.

Abstract
Crystallographic characteristics, including grain boundaries and crystallographic orientation of each grain, are crucial in defining the properties of two&#8208;dimensional materials (2DMs). To date, local microstructure analysis of 2DMs, which requires destructive and complex processes, is primarily used to identify unknown 2DM specimens, hindering the subsequent use of characterized samples. Here, a nondestructive large&#8208;area 2D crystallographic analytical method through sticky&#8208;note&#8208;like van der Waals (vdW) assembling&#8211;disassembling is presented. By the vdW assembling of veiled polycrystalline graphene (PCG) with a single&#8208;atom&#8208;thick single&#8208;crystalline graphene filter (SCG&#8208;filter), detailed crystallographic information of each grain in PCGs is visualized through a 2D Raman signal scan, which relies on the interlayer twist angle. The scanned PCGs are seamlessly separated from the SCG&#8208;filter using vdW disassembling, preserving their original condition. The remaining SCG&#8208;filter is then reused for additional crystallographic scans of other PCGs. It is believed that the methods can pave the way for advances in the crystallographic analysis of single&#8208;atom&#8208;thick materials, offering huge implications for the applications of 2DMs.

         <title>Stepwise Charge/Energy Transfer in MR&#8208;TADF Molecule&#8208;Doped Exciplex for Ultralong Persistent Luminescence Activated with Visible Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a stepwise charge/energy transfer strategy is presented in a ternary system to fabricate visible&#8208;light&#8208;activated organic long&#8208;persistent luminescence (OLPL) materials. Incorporating a multiresonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence molecule in the donor&#8211;acceptor exciplex facilitates the energy storage and the release of photons, yielding a remarkably enhanced OLPL with a duration time exceeding 4 h.








Abstract
Organic long&#8208;persistent luminescence (OLPL), which relies on energy storage for delayed light emission by the charge separation state, has attracted intense attention in various optical applications. However, charge separation (CS) is efficient only under ultraviolet excitation in most OLPL systems because it requires a driving force from the large energy difference between the local excited (LE) and charge transfer (CT) states. In this study, a multiresonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) molecule is incorporated into an exciplex system to achieve efficient OLPL in a composite material activated by visible light via a stepwise charge/energy transfer process. The enhanced absorption of the composite material facilitated a tenfold increase in the duration of the OLPL, which can last for several hours under visible light excitation. The excited state of the MR&#8208;TADF molecule tends to charge transfer to the acceptor, followed by energy transfer to the exciplex, which benefits from the small difference between the LE and CT states owing to the inherent CS characteristics of the opposing resonance effect. Afterglow displays of these composite materials are fabricated to demonstrate their considerable potential in encryption patterns and emergency lights, which take advantage of their excellent processability, visible light activation, and tunable luminescence properties.

         <title>Perspectives on the Practicability of Li&#8208;Rich NMC Layered Oxide Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective presents how the practicability of Li&#8208;rich NMCs is limited by issues like tap density, electrolytes, gas generation, voltage hysteresis, and decay. A techno&#8208;economic analysis is also provided to show that Li&#8208;rich NMCs have material cost highly dependent on lithium price, but still preserve the dominance of lower pack cost than other cathode candidates.








Abstract
Li&#8208;rich NMCs layered oxides, with the general formula of Li[LixNiyMnzCo1&#8722;x&#8722;y&#8722;z]O2, are known for their exceptionally high capacities but remain yet to be practicalized in the real world. They have attracted enormous research attention due to their complex structure and intriguing redox mechanisms, with a particular focus on anionic redox over the past decade. While fundamental understandings are fruitful, the practical considerations are emphasized here by providing perspectives on how Li&#8208;rich NMCs are limited by practical roadblocks and guidelines on how to cope with these limitations. It is also demonstrated that, via a techno&#8208;economic analysis, Li&#8208;rich NMCs have material cost ($/kg) highly dependent on the lithium price, but still preserve the dominance of lower pack cost ($/kWh) than other cathode candidates principally owing to their larger material energy densities. In addition to their pure application in electric&#8208;vehicle batteries, using them as &#8220;electrode additive&#8221; or &#8220;sacrificial agent&#8221; can further multiply their practicalities in assortment of scenarios, which is further discussed.

         <title>Chiral Kirigami for Bend&#8208;Tolerant Reconfigurable Hologram with Continuously Variable Chirality Measures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates that chirality&#8208;guided pixelation of plasmonic kirigami sheets allows tunable multiplexed holography at terahertz (THz) frequencies. The slanted Au strips enable light modulation and real&#8208;time switching of complex grayscale 3D images. The resilient design ensures minimal chirality change with bending, paving the way for fault&#8208;tolerant THz encryption, wearable holographic devices, and advanced communication technologies.








Abstract
Despite the commonality of static holograms, the holography with multiple information layers and reconfigurable grey&#8208;scale images at communication frequencies remain a confluence of scientific challenges. One well&#8208;known difficulty is the simultaneous modulation of phase and amplitude of electromagnetic wavefronts with a high modulation depth. A less appreciated challenge is scrambling of the information and images with hologram bending. Here, this work shows that chirality&#8208;guided pixelation of plasmonic kirigami sheets enables tunable multiplexed holography at terahertz (THz) frequencies. The convex and concave structures with slanted Au strips exhibit gradual variations in geometries facilitating modulation of light ellipticity reaching 40&#160;deg. Real&#8208;time switching of 3D images of the letter &#8220;M&#8221; and the Mona Lisa demonstrates the possibility of complex grey&#8208;scale information content and importance of continuously variable mirror asymmetry. Microscale chirality measures of each pixel experiences little change with bending while retaining controllable reconfigurability upon stretching, which translates to remarkable resilience of chiral holograms to bending. Simplicity of their design with local chirality measures opens the door to information technologies with fault&#8208;tolerant THz encryption, wearable holographic devices, and new communication technologies.

         <title>Precise and High&#8208;Throughput Delivery of Micronutrients in Plants Enabled by Pollen&#8208;Inspired Spiny and Biodegradable Microcapsules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An antirunoff, biodegradable microencapsulation technology inspired by pollen for the precise and efficient delivery of micronutrients in plants is presented. The results feature silk&#8208;based microcapsules encapsulating Fe fertilizers, prepared through a vapor&#8208;induced synergistic assembly method. The technology demonstrates significant reductions in wash&#8208;off and enhanced chlorophyll content in spinach plants, showcasing its potential for precise and high&#8208;throughput agricultural practices.








Abstract
Decarbonizing food production and mitigating agriculture's environmental impact require new technologies for precise delivery of fertilizers and pesticides to plants. The cuticle, a waxy barrier that protects the surface of leaves, causes 60%&#8211;90% runoff of fertilizers and pesticides, leading to the wastage of intensive resources, soil depletion, and water bodies pollution. Solutions to mitigate runoff include adding chemicals (e.g., surfactants) to decrease surface tension and enhance cuticles' permeability but have low efficacy. In this study, vapor&#8208;induced synergistic differentiation (VISDi) is used to nanomanufacture echinate pollen&#8208;like, high payload content (&#8776;50 wt%) microcapsules decorated with robust spines that mechanically disrupt the cuticle and adhere to the leaf. VISDi induces a core&#8211;shell structure in the spines, enabling the release of agrochemicals from the microparticles' body into the leaf. As proof of concept, precise and highthroughput delivery of iron fertilizer in Fe&#8208;deficient spinach plants is demonstrated. Spray of spiny microparticles improves leaf adhesion by mechanical interlocking, reduces wash&#8208;off by an &#8776;12.5 fold, and enhances chlorophyll content by &#8776;7.3 times compared to the application of spherical counterparts. Together, these results show that spiny microparticles can mitigate agricultural runoff and provide a high&#8208;throughput tool for precise plant drug delivery.

The cuticle, a waxy barrier that protects the surface of leaves, causes 60%&#8211;90% runoff of fertilizers and pesticides, leading to the wastage of intensive resources, soil depletion, and water bodies pollution. Solutions to mitigate runoff include adding chemicals (e.g., surfactants) to decrease surface tension and enhance cuticles' permeability but have low efficacy. In this study, vapor-induced synergistic differentiation (VISDi) is used to nanomanufacture echinate pollen-like, high payload content (&#8776;50 wt%) microcapsules decorated with robust spines that mechanically disrupt the cuticle and adhere to the leaf. VISDi induces a core&#8211;shell structure in the spines, enabling the release of agrochemicals from the microparticles' body into the leaf. As proof of concept, precise and highthroughput delivery of iron fertilizer in Fe-deficient spinach plants is demonstrated. Spray of spiny microparticles improves leaf adhesion by mechanical interlocking, reduces wash-off by an &#8776;12.5 fold, and enhances chlorophyll content by &#8776;7.3 times compared to the application of spherical counterparts. Together, these results show that spiny microparticles can mitigate agricultural runoff and provide a high-throughput tool for precise plant drug delivery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Grooved Microneedle Patch Augments Adoptive T Cell Therapy Against Solid Tumors via Diverting Regulatory T Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A grooved microneedle patch is designed to efficiently deliver engineered T cells to tumor sites and selectively divert Treg cells towards the microneedles. Leveraging this engineered patch as a local niche could not only enhance the infiltration of engineered T cells in the solid tumor, but also eliminate Treg cells through a non&#8208;apoptosis&#8208;inducing mechanism, unlike chemotherapy.








Abstract
The efficacy of adoptive T cell therapy (ACT) for the treatment of solid tumors remains challenging. In addition to the poor infiltration of effector T (Teff) cells limited by the physical barrier surrounding the solid tumor, another major obstacle is the extensive infiltration of regulatory T (Treg) cells, a major immunosuppressive immune cell subset, in the tumor microenvironment. Here, this work develops a grooved microneedle patch for augmenting ACT, aiming to simultaneously overcome physical and immunosuppressive barriers. The microneedles are engineered through an ice&#8208;templated method to generate the grooved structure for sufficient T&#8208;cell loading. In addition, with the surface modification of chemokine CCL22, the MNs could not only directly deliver tumor&#8208;specific T cells into solid tumors through physical penetration, but also specifically divert Treg cells from the tumor microenvironment to the surface of the microneedles via a cytokine concentration gradient, leading to an increase in the ratio of Teff cells/Treg cells in a mouse melanoma model. Consequently, this local delivery strategy of both T cell receptor T cells and chimeric antigen receptor T cells via the CCL22&#8208;modified grooved microneedles as a local niche could significantly enhance the antitumor efficacy and reduce the on&#8208;target off&#8208;tumor toxicity of ACT.

         <title>Constructing Ru&#8208;O&#8208;TM Bridge in NiFe&#8208;LDH Enables High Current Hydrazine&#8208;assisted H2 Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ru&#9472;O&#9472;Ni/Fe bridges are constructed by anchoring the Ru cluster on NiFe&#8208;LDH substrate, the broader d&#8208;band width (Wd) and lower d&#8208;band center of Ru atoms have weakened the over&#8208;strong adsorption of intermediates on&#160;Ru surface, hence the catalytic property of Ruc/NiFe&#8208;LDH is improved, showing outstanding prospect in practical hydrazine&#8208;assisted H2 generation.








Abstract
Hydrazine oxidation&#8208;assisted water splitting is a critical technology to tackle the high energy consumption in large&#8208;scale H2 production. Ru&#8208;based electrocatalysts hold promise for synergetic hydrogen reduction (HER) and hydrazine oxidation (HzOR) catalysis but are hindered by excessive superficial adsorption of reactant intermediate. Herein, this work designs Ru cluster anchoring on NiFe&#8208;LDH (denoted as Ruc/NiFe&#8208;LDH), which effectively enhances the intermediate adsorption capacity of Ru by constructing Ru&#9472;O&#9472;Ni/Fe bridges. Notably, it achieves an industrial current density of 1&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 at an unprecedentedly low voltage of 0.43&#160;V, saving 3.94&#160;kWh m&#8722;3H2 in energy, and exhibits remarkable stability over 120 h at a high current density of 5 A cm&#8722;2. Advanced characterizations and theoretical calculation reveal that the presence of Ru&#9472;O&#9472;Ni/Fe bridges widens the d&#8208;band width (Wd) of the Ru cluster, leading to a lower d&#8208;band center and higher electron occupation on antibonding orbitals, thereby facilitating moderate adsorption energy and enhanced catalytic activity of Ru.

         <title>DNA Framework&#8208;Enabled 3D Organization of Antiarrhythmic Drugs for Radiofrequency Catheter Ablation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates the use of tetrahedral DNA framework (TDF) to preorganize doxorubicin (Dox) for catheter ablation, aiming to improve treatment efficacy while minimizing post&#8208;ablation complications. TDF&#8208;Dox significantly increases intracellular Dox concentration, promoting cardiomyocyte apoptosis. In vivo results show reduced recurrence rates of electrical conduction after ablation with minimal adverse effects, offering a promising therapeutic approach.








Abstract
Preorganizing molecular drugs within a microenvironment is crucial for the development of efficient and controllable therapeutic systems. Here, the use of tetrahedral DNA framework (TDF) is reported to preorganize antiarrhythmic drugs (herein doxorubicin, Dox) in 3D for catheter ablation, a minimally invasive treatment for fast heartbeats, aiming to address potential complications linked to collateral tissue damage and the post&#8208;ablation atrial fibrillation (AF) recurrence resulting from incomplete ablation. Dox preorganization within TDF transforms its random distribution into a confined, regular spatial arrangement governed by DNA. This, combined with the high affinity between Dox and DNA, significantly increases local Dox concentration. The exceptional capacity of TDF for cellular internalization leads to a 5.5&#8208;fold increase in intracellular Dox amount within cardiomyocytes, effectively promoting cellular apoptosis. In vivo investigations demonstrate that administering TDF&#8208;Dox reduces the recurrence rate of electrical conduction after radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) to 37.5%, compared with the 77.8% recurrence rate in the free Dox&#8208;treated group. Notably, the employed Dox dosage exhibits negligible adverse effects in vivo. This study presents a promising treatment paradigm that strengthens the efficacy of catheter ablation and opens a new avenue for reconciling the paradox of ablation efficacy and collateral damage.

         <title>Urea Electrosynthesis from Nitrate and CO2 on Diatomic Alloys</title>

         <dc:description>
CuPd1Rh1 diatomic alloy is explored as a highly active and selective catalyst toward the UENC, arising from the synergistic effect of Pd1&#8211;Cu and Rh1&#8211;Cu active sites to promote the UENC via a tandem catalysis mechanism, where Pd1&#8211;Cu site triggers the early C&#8211;N coupling and promotes *CO2NO2&#8211;to&#8211;*CO2NH steps, while Rh1&#8211;Cu site facilitates the subsequent protonation step of *CO2NH2 to *COOHNH2 toward the urea formation.








Abstract
Urea electrosynthesis from co&#8211;electrolysis of NO3
&#8722; and CO2 (UENC) offers a promising technology for achieving sustainable and efficient urea production. Herein, a diatomic alloy catalyst (CuPd1Rh1&#8211;DAA), with mutually isolated Pd and Rh atoms alloyed on Cu substrate, is theoretically designed and experimentally confirmed to be a highly active and selective UENC catalyst. Combining theoretical computations and operando spectroscopic characterizations reveals the synergistic effect of Pd1&#8211;Cu and Rh1&#8211;Cu active sites to promote the UENC via a tandem catalysis mechanism, where Pd1&#8211;Cu site triggers the early C&#8211;N coupling and promotes *CO2NO2&#8211;to&#8211;*CO2NH steps, while Rh1&#8211;Cu site facilitates the subsequent protonation step of *CO2NH2 to *COOHNH2 toward the urea formation. Impressively, CuPd1Rh1&#8211;DAA assembled in a flow cell presents the highest urea Faradaic efficiency of 72.1% and urea yield rate of 53.2&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 gcat&#8722;1 at &#8722;0.5&#160;V versus RHE, representing nearly the highest performance among all reported UENC catalysts.

Impressively, CuPd&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;Rh&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;DAA assembled in a flow cell presents the highest urea Faradaic efficiency of 72.1% and urea yield rate of 53.2&#160;mmol h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; g&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at &#8722;0.5&#160;V versus RHE, representing nearly the highest performance among all reported UENC catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Intrinsic Grain Boundary Structure and Enhanced Defect States in Air&#8208;Sensitive Polycrystalline 1T&#8217;&#8208;WTe2 Monolayer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the integration of the custom&#8208;designed glove&#8208;box interconnection system with atomic&#8208;level scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) characterization and scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, this work has successfully identified, for the first time, three intrinsic grain boundary structures within the air&#8208;sensitive single&#8208;layer two&#8208;dimensional (2D) topological insulator&#8208;WTe2. Additionally, this investigation has revealed heightened electron state densities at these grain boundaries.








Abstract
Monolayer WTe2 has attracted significant attention for its unconventional superconductivity and topological edge states. However, its air sensitivity poses challenges for studying intrinsic defect structures. This study addresses this issue using a custom&#8208;built inert gas interconnected system, and investigate the intrinsic grain boundary (GB) structures of monolayer polycrystalline 1T&#8217; WTe2 grown by nucleation&#8208;controlled chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. These findings reveal that GBs in this system are predominantly governed by W&#8208;Te rhombi with saturated coordination, resulting in three specific GB prototypes without dislocation cores. The GBs exhibit anisotropic orientations influenced by kinks formed from these fundamental units, which in turn affect the distribution of grains in various shapes within polycrystalline flakes. Scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/S) analysis further reveals metallic states along the intrinsic 120&#176; twin grain boundary (TGB), consistent with computed band structures. This systematic exploration of GBs in air&#8208;sensitive 1T&#8217; WTe2 monolayers provides valuable insights into emerging GB&#8208;related phenomena.

         <title>Hexacarbazolylbenzene: An Excellent Host Molecule Causing Strong Guest Molecular Orientation and the High&#8208;Performance OLEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study unveils great potential of hexacarbazolylbenzene (6CzPh) as host material in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). This host material leads to complete horizontal molecular orientations (&#920;h = 100%, S = &#8722;0.50) of 4CzIPN, and the device realizes high efficiency with a long device lifetime.








Abstract
Hexacarbazolylbenzene (6CzPh), which is benzene substituted by six carbazole rings, is a simple and attractive compound. Despite the success of a wide variety of carbazole derivatives in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), 6CzPh has not received attention so far. Here, excellent performances of 6CzPh are revealed as a host material in OLEDs regarding conventional host materials. Various strategies are implemented to improve the performance of OLEDs, e.g., triplet utilization by thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and phosphorescence emitters for maximizing internal quantum efficiency, and molecular orientation control for increasing outcoupling efficiency. The present host material is suited for both criteria. Robustness of the structure and sufficiently high triplet energy enables a high external quantum efficiency with a long device lifetime. Besides, the host material boosts the horizontal molecular orientations of several guest emitters. It is noteworthy that disk&#8208;shaped 4CzIPN marks the complete horizontal molecular orientations (&#920;h = 100%, S = &#8722;0.50). These results provide an effective way of improving efficiencies without sacrificing device durability for future OLEDs.

         <title>A Synergistic Chemoimmunotherapy System Leveraging PD&#8208;L1 Blocking and Bioorthogonal Prodrug Activation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel antitumor chemoimmunotherapy system combining a tetrazine&#8208;modified anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibody with a tetrazine&#8208;activatable prodrug (&#945;PD&#8208;L1TZ plus NP@PDOX) is developed, which helps realize the site&#8208;selective bioorthogonal activation of the prodrug, disrupt PD&#8208;L1/PD&#8208;1 interaction, and induce immunogenic cell death. The antitumor efficacy of this nanoplatform is amplified by the mutually augmented feedback between PD&#8208;L1 blocking and prodrug activation.








Abstract
Novel strategies to facilitate tumor&#8208;specific drug delivery and restore immune attacks remain challenging in overcoming the current limitations of chemoimmunotherapy. An antitumor chemoimmunotherapy system comprising bioorthogonal reaction&#8208;ready group tetrazine (TZ) modified with an anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibody (&#945;PD&#8208;L1TZ) and TZ&#8208;activatable prodrug vinyl ether&#8208;doxorubicin (DOX&#8208;VE) for self&#8208;reinforced anti&#8208;tumor chemoimmunotherapy is proposed. The &#945;PD&#8208;L1TZ effectively disrupts the PD&#8208;L1/PD&#8208;1 interaction and activates the DOX prodrug in situ through the bioorthogonal click reaction of TZ and VE. Conversely, the activated DOX upregulates PD&#8208;L1 on the surface of tumor cells, facilitating tumor accumulation of &#945;PD&#8208;L1TZ and enhancing DOX&#8208;VE activation. Furthermore, the activated DOX&#8208;induced immunogenic cell death of tumor cells, substantially improving the response efficiency of &#945;PD&#8208;L1 in an immune&#8208;suppressive tumor microenvironment. Thus, PD&#8208;L1 blocking and bioorthogonal in situ prodrug activation synergistically enhance the antitumor efficacy of the chemoimmunotherapy system. Therefore, the system significantly enhances &#945;PD&#8208;L1 tumor accumulation and prodrug activation and induces a robust immunological memory effect to prevent tumor recurrence and metastasis. Thus, a feasible chemoimmunotherapy combination regimen is presented.

         <title>Stable Oxyhalide&#8208;Nitride Fast Ionic Conductors for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Li Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work provides a group of oxyhalide&#8208;nitride solid&#8208;state electrolytes (ONSEs) that possess high ionic conductivity of 0.52 mS cm&#8722;1 accompanied with low activation energy of 0.35 eV. The ONSEs are capable of achieving long&#8208;term cycling of Li||Li symmetric cell, as well as providing a high critical current density of &gt;7.4 mA cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Rechargeable all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (ASSLMBs) utilizing inorganic solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) are promising for electric vehicles and large&#8208;scale grid energy storage. However, the Li dendrite growth in SSEs still constrains the practical utility of ASSLMBs. To achieve a high dendrite&#8208;suppression capability, SSEs must be chemically stable with Li, possess fast Li transfer kinetics, and exhibit high interface energy. Herein, a class of low&#8208;cost, eco&#8208;friendly, and sustainable oxyhalide&#8208;nitride solid electrolytes (ONSEs), denoted as LixNyIz&#8208;qLiOH (where x = 3y + z, 0 &#8804; q &#8804; 0.75), is designed to fulfill all the requirements. As&#8208;prepared ONSEs demonstrate chemically stable against Li and high interface energy (&gt;43.08 meV &#197;&#8722;2), effectively restraining Li dendrite growth and the self&#8208;degradation at electrode interfaces. Furthermore, improved thermodynamic oxidation stability of ONSEs (&gt;3&#160;V vs Li+/Li, 0.45&#160;V for pure Li3N), arising from the increased ionicity of Li&#9472;N bonds, contributes to the stability in ASSLMBs. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the optimized ONSEs possess high ionic conductivity of 0.52 mS cm&#8722;1 and achieve long&#8208;term cycling of Li||Li symmetric cell for over 500&#160;h. When coupled with the Li3InCl6 SSE for high&#8208;voltage cathodes, the bilayer oxyhalide&#8208;nitride/Li3InCl6 electrolyte imparts 90% capacity retention over 500 cycles for Li||1 mAh cm&#8722;2 LiCoO2 cells.

&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;q&lt;/i&gt;LiOH (where &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; = 3&lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt; + &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;, 0 &#8804; &lt;i&gt;q&lt;/i&gt; &#8804; 0.75), is designed to fulfill all the requirements. As-prepared ONSEs demonstrate chemically stable against Li and high interface energy (&amp;gt;43.08 meV &#197;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), effectively restraining Li dendrite growth and the self-degradation at electrode interfaces. Furthermore, improved thermodynamic oxidation stability of ONSEs (&amp;gt;3&#160;V vs Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Li, 0.45&#160;V for pure Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N), arising from the increased ionicity of Li&#9472;N bonds, contributes to the stability in ASSLMBs. As a proof-of-concept, the optimized ONSEs possess high ionic conductivity of 0.52 mS cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and achieve long-term cycling of Li||Li symmetric cell for over 500&#160;h. When coupled with the Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;InCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; SSE for high-voltage cathodes, the bilayer oxyhalide-nitride/Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;InCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; electrolyte imparts 90% capacity retention over 500 cycles for Li||1 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Halogen Interactions Inducing Phase Separation for Self&#8208;Healing and Tough Ionogels with Tunable Thermoelectric Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;healing and tough ionogel (PEO/LiTFSI/EmimCl) with tunable thermoelectric properties is developed by tailoring metal&#8208;halogen bonding interactions to induce phase separation, which provides a versatile approach to address the long&#8208;standing trade&#8208;offs between self&#8208;healing ability, stretchability, strength, and ionic conductivity in current thermoelectric ionogels.








Abstract

Ionic liquid&#8208;based thermoelectric gels become a compelling candidate for thermoelectric power generation and sensing due to their giant thermopower, good thermal stability, high flexibility, and low&#8208;cost production. However, the materials reported to date suffer from canonical trade&#8208;offs between self&#8208;healing ability, stretchability, strength, and ionic conductivity. Herein, a self&#8208;healing and tough ionogel (PEO/LiTFSI/EmimCl) with tunable thermoelectric properties by tailoring metal&#8208;halogen bonding interactions, is developed. Different affinities between polymer matrix and salts are exploited to induce phase separation, resulting in simultaneous enhancement of ionic conductivity and mechanical strength. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and spectroscopic analyses show that Cl&#8722; ions impair the lithium&#8208;ether oxygen coordination, leading to changes in chain conformation. The migration difference between cations and anions is thus widened and a transition from n&#8208;type to p&#8208;type thermoelectric ionogels is realized. Furthermore, the dynamic interactions of metal&#8208;ligand coordination and hydrogen bonding yield autonomously self&#8208;healing capability, large stretchability (2000%), and environment&#8208;friendly recyclability. Benefiting from these fascinating properties, the multifunctional PEO&#8208;based ionogels are applied in sensors, supercapacitors, and thermoelectric power generation modules. The strategy of tuning solvation dominance to address the trade&#8208;offs in thermoelectric ionogels and optimize their macroscopic properties offers new possibilities for the design of advanced ionogels.

         <title>Hydrogen Bonds Induced Ultralong Stability of Conductive &#960;&#8211;d Conjugated FeCo3(DDA)2 with High OER Activity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conductive &#960;&#8211;d conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) FeCo3(DDA)2 (DDA = 1,5&#8208;diamino&#8208;4,8&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;9,10&#8208;anthraceneedione) with hydrogen bonds (H&#8208;bonds) is fabricated successfully. FeCo3(DDA)2 with H&#8208;bonds exhibits ultrahigh oxygen evolution reaction (OER) stability (up to 2000&#160;h), which is far longer than the MOF materials reported thus far. 








Abstract
Conductive &#960;&#8211;d conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted wide concerns in electrocatalysis due to their intrinsic high conductivity. However, the poor electrocatalytic stability is still a major problem that hinders the practical application of MOFs. Herein, a novel approach to enhancing the stability of MOF&#8208;based electrocatalyst, namely, the introduction of hydrogen bonds (H&#8208;bonds), is reported. Impressively, the &#960;&#8211;d conjugated MOF FeCo3(DDA)2 (DDA = 1,5&#8208;diamino&#8208;4,8&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;9,10&#8208;anthraceneedione) exhibits ultrahigh oxygen evolution reaction (OER) stability (up to 2000&#160;h). The experimental studies demonstrate that the presence of H&#8208;bonds in FeCo3(DDA)2 is responsible for its ultrahigh OER stability. Besides that, FeCo3(DDA)2 also displays a prominent OER activity (an overpotential of 260&#160;mV vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a Tafel slope of 46.86&#160;mV dec&#8722;1). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further indicate that the synergistic effect of the Fe and Co sites in FeCo3(DDA)2 contributes to its prominent OER performance. This work provides a new avenue of boosting the electrocatalytic stability of conductive &#960;&#8211;d conjugated MOFs.

         <title>Supersoft Norbornene&#8208;Based Thermoplastic Elastomers with High Strength and Upper Service Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization is used to create thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs) that surpass state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art commercial TPEs in their combined softness, strength, and upper service temperatures. These recyclable TPEs show &#8220;life&#8208;like&#8221; strain stiffening mechanical responses, making them promising candidates for applications that interface with the human body, from soft robotics to wearable electronics.








Abstract
With over 6 million tons produced annually, thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs) have become ubiquitous in modern society, due to their unique combination of elasticity, toughness, and reprocessability. Nevertheless, industrial TPEs display a tradeoff between softness and strength, along with low upper service temperatures, typically &#8804;100&#160;&#176;C. This limits their utility, such as in bio&#8208;interfacial applications where supersoft deformation is required in tandem with strength, in addition to applications that require thermal stability (e.g., encapsulation of electronics, seals/joints for aeronautics, protective clothing for firefighting, and biomedical devices that can be subjected to steam sterilization). Thus, combining softness, strength, and high thermal resistance into a single versatile TPE has remained an unmet opportunity. Through de novo design and synthesis of novel norbornene&#8208;based ABA triblock copolymers, this gap is filled. Ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization is employed to prepare TPEs with an unprecedented combination of properties, including skin&#8208;like moduli (&lt;100&#160;kPa), strength competitive with commercial TPEs (&gt;5&#160;MPa), and upper service temperatures akin to high&#8208;performance plastics (&#8776;260&#160;&#176;C). Furthermore, the materials are elastic, tough, reprocessable, and shelf stable (&#8805;2 months) without incorporation of plasticizer. Structure&#8211;property relationships identified herein inform development of next&#8208;generation TPEs that are both biologically soft yet thermomechanically durable.

         <title>Van der Waals Epitaxial Growth of Ultrathin Indium Antimonide on Arbitrary Substrates through Low&#8208;Thermal Budget</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, InSb nanosheets with tunable thickness are successfully synthesized on arbitrary substrates with growth temperatures as low as 240&#160;&#176;C. These InSb nanosheets exhibit electrical and optoelectronic properties, characterized by significantly high field effect transistor on&#8208;off ratios, hole mobility, and negligible leakage currents, offering a promising avenue for advancing III&#8211;V complementary metal oxide semiconductor technology.








Abstract
III&#8211;V semiconductors possess high mobility, high frequency response, and detection sensitivity, making them potentially attractive for beyond&#8208;silicon electronics applications. However, the traditional heteroepitaxy of III&#8211;V semiconductors is impeded by a significant lattice mismatch and the necessity for extreme vacuum and high temperature conditions, thereby impeding their in situ compatibility with flexible substrates and silicon&#8208;based circuits. In this study, a novel approach is presented for fabricating ultrathin InSb single&#8208;crystal nanosheets on arbitrary substrates with a thickness as thin as 2.4&#160;nm using low&#8208;thermal&#8208;budget van der Waals (vdW) epitaxy through chemical vapor deposition (CVD). In particular, in situ growth has been successfully achieved on both silicon&#8208;based substrates and flexible polyimide (PI) substrates. Notably, the growth temperature required for InSb nanosheets (240&#160;&#176;C) is significantly lower than that employed in back&#8208;end&#8208;of&#8208;line processes (400&#160;&#176;C). The field effect transistor devices based on fabricated ultrathin InSb nanosheets exhibit ultra&#8208;high on&#8208;off ratio exceeding 108 and demonstrate minimal gate leakage currents. Furthermore, these ultrathin InSb nanosheets display p&#8208;type characteristics with hole mobilities reaching up to 203 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 at room temperatures.

&lt;p&gt;In this work, InSb nanosheets with tunable thickness are successfully synthesized on arbitrary substrates with growth temperatures as low as 240&#160;&#176;C. These InSb nanosheets exhibit electrical and optoelectronic properties, characterized by significantly high field effect transistor on-off ratios, hole mobility, and negligible leakage currents, offering a promising avenue for advancing III&#8211;V complementary metal oxide semiconductor technology.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;III&#8211;V semiconductors possess high mobility, high frequency response, and detection sensitivity, making them potentially attractive for beyond-silicon electronics applications. However, the traditional heteroepitaxy of III&#8211;V semiconductors is impeded by a significant lattice mismatch and the necessity for extreme vacuum and high temperature conditions, thereby impeding their in situ compatibility with flexible substrates and silicon-based circuits. In this study, a novel approach is presented for fabricating ultrathin InSb single-crystal nanosheets on arbitrary substrates with a thickness as thin as 2.4&#160;nm using low-thermal-budget van der Waals (vdW) epitaxy through chemical vapor deposition (CVD). In particular, in situ growth has been successfully achieved on both silicon-based substrates and flexible polyimide (PI) substrates. Notably, the growth temperature required for InSb nanosheets (240&#160;&#176;C) is significantly lower than that employed in back-end-of-line processes (400&#160;&#176;C). The field effect transistor devices based on fabricated ultrathin InSb nanosheets exhibit ultra-high on-off ratio exceeding 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; and demonstrate minimal gate leakage currents. Furthermore, these ultrathin InSb nanosheets display p-type characteristics with hole mobilities reaching up to 203 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at room temperatures. This study paves the way for achieving heterogeneous integration of III&#8211;V semiconductors and facilitating their application in flexible electronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Polyplatin with Hands&#8208;Holding Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;II Fluorophores and Prodrugs at a Precise Ratio for Tracking Drug Fate with Realtime Readout and Treatment Feedback</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
For real&#8208;time drug tracking with accurate drug metabolism information, a near infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II) fluorophore is conjugated with Pt(IV) prodrug via a covalent bond to form PolyplatinDT. PolymerDT DT then self&#8208;assembled into NanoplatinDT. Attaching caspase&#8208;3 sensitive peptide onto NanoplatinDT forms NanoplatinDTR, which enables simultaneously drug tracking with NIR&#8208;II fluorescence and evaluating its therapeutic efficacy with green fluorescence. 








Abstract
The in vivo fate of chemotherapeutic drugs plays a vital role in understanding the therapeutic outcome, side effects, and the mechanism. However, the lack of imaging abilities of drugs, tedious labeling processes, and premature leakage of imaging agents result in loss of fidelity between the drugs and imaging signals. Herein, an amphiphilic polymer is created by copolymerization of a near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II) fluorophore tracer (T) and an anticancer Pt(IV) prodrug (D) of cisplatin in a hand&#8208;holding manner into one polymer chain for the first time. The obtained PolyplatinDT is capable of delivering the drugs and the fluorophores concomitantly at a precise D/T ratio, thereby resulting in tracking the platinum drugs and even readout of them in real&#8208;time via NIR&#8208;II imaging. PolyplatinDT can self&#8208;assemble into nanoparticles, referred to as NanoplatinDT. Furthermore, a caspase&#8208;3 cleavable peptide that serves as an apoptosis reporter is attached to NanoplatinDT, resulting in NanoplatinDTR that are capable of simultaneously tracking platinum drugs and evaluating the therapeutic efficacy. Overall, it is reported here the design of the first theranostic polymer with anticancer drugs, drug tracers, and drug efficacy reporters that can work in concert to provide insight into the drug fate and mechanism of action.

         <title>Vacuum Thermoforming of Optically Switchable Liquid Crystalline Elastomer Spherical Actuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates the industrially&#8208;relevant process of vacuum thermoforming may be applied to thermoplastic liquid crystal elastomers to form centimeter&#8208;scale hemispheres capable of reversible actuation and striking changes in transparency upon heating: simulations predict the resulting mesogenic alignment generated by the process. Demonstrators are presented including &#8220;surfing&#8221; boats driven by infrared light and complete spheres formed by bonding two hemispheres.








Abstract
Liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) actuators are generally limited in shape, size, and quantity by the need for aligning via stretching and fixing via photopolymerizing. A thermoplastic LCE is presented that may be vacuum thermoformed into centimeter&#8208;sized hemispheres. The scalable industrial process induces LCE alignment without requiring postfixing. The hemispheres display remarkable properties, actuating with strains around 20% and transitioning from opaque and scattering to highly translucent upon heating: both the physical and optical effects are fully reversible. Simulations reveal the LCE experiences biaxial strains during processing, the magnitude varying as a function of location on the hemisphere: the resulting alignment describing the hemisphere actuation well. The thermoplastic LCE hemispheres may be combined to form complete spheres by simply heating the joint. The hemisphere can also be physically deformed into a ball which can then unfold back into the hemisphere again. By doping the hemispheres with photoswitches, fluorescent or photothermal dyes, devices are formed for light collection and redistribution, addressable water containers that may pour at will, and light&#8208;responsive surfing devices. This is the first example of an LCE amenable to high&#8208;volume industrial vacuum thermoforming which may lead to intricate 3D&#8208;shaped actuators with new functional properties.

         <title>Fluoro&#8208;Ethylene&#8208;Carbonate Plays a Double&#8208;Edged Role on the Stability of Si Anode&#8208;Based Rechargeable Batteries During Cycling and Calendar Aging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work investigates the underlying mechanisms that cause calendar aging effects&#160;in Si anode&#8208;based Li ion batteries. Plasma focused ion beam tomography reveals the formation and growth of a LiF&#8208;rich layer at the interface between the silicon and the copper current collector, and is caused by a commonly used electrolyte additive.








Abstract
The energy storage density of Li&#8208;ion batteries can be improved by replacing graphite anodes with high&#8208;capacity Si&#8208;based materials, though instabilities have limited their implementation. Performance degradation mechanisms that occur in Si anodes can be divided into cycling stability (capacity retention after repeated battery cycles) and calendar aging (shelf life). While cycling instabilities and improvement strategies have been researched intensively, there is little known about the underlying mechanisms that cause calendar aging. In this work, multiple electron microscope techniques are used to explore the mechanism that governs calendar aging from the sub&#8208;nanometer&#8208;to&#8208;electrode scale. Plasma focused ion beam tomography is used to create 3D reconstructions of calendar aged electrodes and revealed the growth of a LiF&#8208;rich layer at the interface between the copper current collector and the silicon material, which can lead to delamination and increased interfacial impendence. The LiF layer appeared to derive from the fluoro&#8208;ethylene&#8208;carbonate electrolyte additive, which is commonly used to improve cycling stability in Si&#8208;based systems. The results reveal that additives necessary to improve cycling stability can cause performance degradation over the long&#8208;term during calendar aging. The results show that high performing, stable systems require careful design to simultaneously mitigate both cycling and calendar aging instabilities.

         <title>KIr4O8 Nanowires with Rich Hydroxyl Promote Oxygen Evolution Reaction in Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolyzer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydroxyl&#8208;rich KIr4O8 nanowires catalyzes oxygen evolution reaction via a modified adsorbate evolution mechanism and optimal proximity between Ir (d) and O (p) band center, showing high performance and long&#8208;term stability in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer.








Abstract
The sluggish kinetics for anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and insufficient catalytic performance over the corresponding Ir&#8208;based catalysts are still enormous challenges in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE). Herein, it is reported that KIr4O8 nanowires anode catalyst with more exposed active sites and rich hydroxyl achieves a current density of 1.0 A cm&#8722;2 at 1.68&#160;V and possesses excellent catalytic stability with 1230&#160;h in PEMWE. Combining in situ Raman spectroscopy and differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy results, the modified adsorbate evolution mechanism is proposed, wherein the rich hydroxyl in the inherent structure of KIr4O8 nanowires directly participates in the catalytic process for favoring the OER. Density functional theory calculation results further suggest that the enhanced proximity between Ir (d) and O (p) band center in KIr4O8 can strengthen the covalence of Ir&#8211;O, facilitate the electron transfer between adsorbents and active sites, and decrease the energy barrier of rate&#8208;determining step from OH* to O* during the OER.

Density functional theory calculation results further suggest that the enhanced proximity between Ir (&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;) and O (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;) band center in KIr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; can strengthen the covalence of Ir&#8211;O, facilitate the electron transfer between adsorbents and active sites, and decrease the energy barrier of rate-determining step from OH&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; to O&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; during the OER.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Elastic&#8208;Plastic Fully &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Polymers (F&#960;CPs) are prepared via side&#8208;chain internal plasticization for deep&#8208;blue flexible polymer light&#8208;emitting diods (PLEDs). Elastic&#8208;plastic F&#960;CPs films present an excellent energy dissipation capacity (maximum fracture strain of 34.6%) and outstanding ultra&#8208;deep&#8208;blue emission (photoluminescence quantum yield of 56.38%). PLEDs based on stretchable films display a stable and efficient ultra&#8208;deep&#8208;blue emission, slightly depended on strains and cycling deformation.








Abstract
Emerging intrinsically flexible fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers (F&#960;CPs) are a promising functional material for flexible optoelectronics, attributed to their potential interchain interpenetration and entanglement. However, the challenge remains in obtaining elastic&#8211;plastic F&#960;CPs with intrinsic robust optoelectronic property and excellent long&#8208;term and cycling deformation stability simultaneously for applications in deep&#8208;blue flexible polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs). This study, demonstrates a series of elastic&#8208;plastic F&#960;CPs (P1&#8211;P4) with an excellent energy dissipation capacity via side&#8208;chain internal plasticization for the ultra&#8208;deep&#8208;blue flexible PLEDs. First, the freestanding P1 film exhibited a maximum fracture strain of 34.6%. More interestingly, the elastic behavior is observed with a low strain (&#8804;10%), and the stretched film with a high deformation (&gt;10%) attributed to plastic processing revealed the robust capacity to realize energy absorption and release. The elastic&#8211;plastic P1 film exhibits outstanding ultra&#8208;deep&#8208;blue emission, with an efficiency of 56.38%. Subsequently, efficient PLEDs are fabricated with an ultra&#8208;deep&#8208;blue emission of CIE (0.16, 0.04) and a maximum external quantum efficiency of 1.73%. Finally, stable and efficient ultra&#8208;deep&#8208;blue electroluminescence are obtained from PLEDs based on stretchable films with different strains and cycling deformations, suggesting excellent elastic&#8211;plastic behavior and deformation stability for flexible electronics.

         <title>Expanded ROS Generation and Hypoxia Reversal: Excipient&#8208;free Self&#8208;assembled Nanotheranostics for Enhanced Cancer Photodynamic Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports that the self&#8208;assembled excipient&#8208;free ISDN overcomes the inefficient reactive oxygen species (ROS) generating capacity of photosensitizers and PDT&#8208;aggravated hypoxia constrains immunity. The hydrophobic interaction forces between ICG and 17&#8208;dimethylaminoethylamino&#8208;17&#8208;demethoxygeldanamycin (17&#8208;DMAG) can promote the photostability of ICG and facilitate its ISC process, resulting in a significant improvement in ROS yield and achieving a potent systemic immune response against pancreatic cancer.








Abstract
The efficacy of photodynamic therapy (PDT)&#8208;related cancer therapies is significantly restricted by two irreconcilable obstacles, i.e., low reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation capability and hypoxia which constrains the immune response. Herein, this work develops a self&#8208;assembled clinical photosensitizer indocyanine green (ICG) and the HSP90 inhibitor 17&#8208;dimethylaminoethylamino&#8208;17&#8208;demethoxygeldanamycin (17&#8208;DMAG) nanoparticles (ISDN) without any excipient. This work discovers that the hydrophobic interaction forces between ICG and 17&#8208;DMAG promote the photostability of ICG and its intersystem crossing (ISC) process, thereby improving the ROS quantum yield from 0.112 to 0.46. Augmented ROS generation enhances PDT efficacy and further enhances immunogenic cell death (ICD) effects. 17&#8208;DMAG inhibits the HSP90/hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor 1&#945; (HIF&#8208;1&#945;) axis to dramatically reverse the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment caused by PDT&#8208;aggravated hypoxia. In a mouse model of pancreatic cancer, ISDN markedly improve cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration and MHC I and MHC II activation, demonstrating the superior ICD effects in situ tumor and the powerful systematic antitumor immunity generation, eventually achieving vigorous antitumor and recurrence resistance. This study proposes an unsophisticated and versatile strategy to significantly improve PDT efficacy for enhancing systemic antitumor immunity and potentially extending it to multiple cancers.

         <title>Calcium Hexacyanoferrate Nanozyme Enhances Plant Stress Resistance by Oxidative Stress Alleviation and Heavy Metal Removal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nano&#8208;platform with enzyme&#8208;mimic activities and ion&#8208;exchange capabilities is used to exert the ability of mimicking six natural enzymes to remove excess reactive oxygen species and heavy metal ions in the environment, providing new opportunities for improving plant antioxidant capacity to enhance stress resistance.








Abstract
Oxidative damage, exacerbated by the excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), profoundly inhibits both crop growth and yield. Herein, a biocompatible nanozyme, calcium hexacyanoferrate nanoparticles (CaHCF NPs), targeting ROS is developed, to mitigate oxidative damage and sequestrate heavy metal ions during plant growth. Uniquely, CaHCF NPs feature multifaced enzyme&#8208;like activities, involving superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD), glutathione peroxidase, thiol peroxidase, and ascorbate peroxidase, which enable them to neutralize excessive ROS. Furthermore, CaHCF NPs promote calcium&#8208;cadmium exchange process, diminishing the uptake of heavy metals. Importantly, 120&#160;&#181;g&#160;mL&#8722;1 of CaHCF NPs alleviate the inhibitory effects of hydrogen peroxide and cadmium chloride on Arabidopsis and tomato.&#160;The activities of SOD, POD, and CAT increase by 46.2%, 74.4%, and 48.3%, respectively, meanwhile the glutathione level rises by 72.4% in Arabidopsis under cadmium stress. Moreover, CaHCF NPs boost the expression of genes associated with antioxidation, heavy metal detoxification, nutrient transport, and stress resistance. These findings unveil the significant potential of nanoplatforms equipped with nanozymes in alleviating oxidative stress in plants, which not only regulate crop growth but also substantially ameliorate yield and quality, heralding a new era in agricultural nanotechnology.

         <title>Fast Transfer of Triplet to Doublet Excitons from Organometallic Host to Organic Radical Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The energy transfer kinetics from organometallic carbene&#8208;metal&#8208;amide (CMA&#8208;CF3) triplet excitons to doublet organic radical semiconductor (TTM&#8208;3PCz) states are investigated by time&#8208;resolved optical spectroscopy showing exchange from sub&#8208;nanosecond timescales. The host:radical design for studying triplet&#8208;doublet energy transfer is enabled by picosecond intersystem crossing of CMA&#8208;CF3 and implemented in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes showing 16% external quantum efficiency at 705 nm.









Abstract
Spin triplet exciton formation sets limits on technologies using organic semiconductors that are confined to singlet&#8208;triplet photophysics. In contrast, excitations in the spin doublet manifold in organic radical semiconductors can show efficient luminescence. Here the dynamics of the spin allowed process of intermolecular energy transfer from triplet to doublet excitons are explored. A carbene&#8208;metal&#8208;amide (CMA&#8208;CF3) is employed as a model triplet donor host, since following photoexcitation it undergoes extremely fast intersystem crossing to generate a population of triplet excitons within 4&#160;ps. This enables a foundational study for tracking energy transfer from triplets to a model radical semiconductor, TTM&#8208;3PCz. Over 74% of all radical luminescence originates from the triplet channel in this system under photoexcitation. It is found that intermolecular triplet&#8208;to&#8208;doublet energy transfer can occur directly and rapidly, with 12% of triplet excitons transferring already on sub&#8208;ns timescales. This enhanced triplet harvesting mechanism is utilized in efficient near&#8208;infrared organic light&#8208;emitting diodes, which can be extended to other opto&#8208;electronic and &#8208;spintronic technologies by radical&#8208;based spin control in molecular semiconductors.

Here the dynamics of the spin allowed process of intermolecular energy transfer from triplet to doublet excitons are explored. A carbene-metal-amide (CMA-CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is employed as a model triplet donor host, since following photoexcitation it undergoes extremely fast intersystem crossing to generate a population of triplet excitons within 4&#160;ps. This enables a foundational study for tracking energy transfer from triplets to a model radical semiconductor, TTM-3PCz. Over 74% of all radical luminescence originates from the triplet channel in this system under photoexcitation. It is found that intermolecular triplet-to-doublet energy transfer can occur directly and rapidly, with 12% of triplet excitons transferring already on sub-ns timescales. This enhanced triplet harvesting mechanism is utilized in efficient near-infrared organic light-emitting diodes, which can be extended to other opto-electronic and -spintronic technologies by radical-based spin control in molecular semiconductors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Insights Into Preaggregation Control of Y&#8208;Series Nonfullerene Acceptors in Liquid State for Highly Efficient Binary Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple yet effective preaggregation control strategy for controlling preaggregation in Y&#8208;series NFAs in solution, utilizing 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;5&#8208;iodopyridine (PDCI) as a solid additive is reported. The addition of PDCI facilitates precise modulation of the preaggregation of Y&#8208;series NFAs, leading to a substantial improvement in photovoltaic performance, offering an alternative pathway to further enhance device efficiency.








Abstract
Leveraging breakthroughs in Y&#8208;series nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs), organic solar cells (OSCs) have achieved impressive power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding 19%. However, progress in advancing OSCs has decelerated due to constraints in realizing the full potential of the Y&#8208;series NFAs. Herein, a simple yet effective solid additive&#8208;induced preaggregation control method employing 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;5&#8208;iodopyridine (PDCI) is reported to unlock the full potential of the Y&#8208;series NFAs. Specifically, PDCI interacts predominantly with Y&#8208;series NFAs enabling enhanced and ordered phase&#8208;aggregation in solution. This method leads to a notable improvement and a redshifted absorption of the acceptor phase during film formation, along with improved crystallinity. Moreover, the PDCI&#8208;induced preaggregation of NFAs in the solution enables ordered molecule packing during the film&#8208;formation process through delicate intermediate states transition. Consequently, the PDCI&#8208;induced preaggregated significantly improves the PCE of PM6:Y6 OSCs from 16.12% to 18.12%, among the best values reported for PM6:Y6 OSCs. Importantly, this approach is universally applicable to other Y&#8208;series NFA&#8208;based OSCs, achieving a champion PCE of 19.02% for the PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 system. Thus, the preaggregation control strategy further unlocks the potential of Y&#8208;series NFAs, offering a promising avenue for enhancing the photovoltaic performance of Y&#8208;series NFA&#8208;based OSCs.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Responsive Nonporous Adaptive Crystals Derived from Pyridinium Hydrochloride and the Application in Iodine Adsorption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thanks to the solvent dimension&#8208;dependent adaptive crystallinity, microcrystals of 4&#8208;(4&#8208;(diphenylamino)phenyl)pyridin&#8208;1&#8208;ium chloride (TPAPyH) undergo a phase transition from nonporous to porous upon exposure to iodine vapor. TPAPyH demonstrates exceptional performance in iodine storage, exhibiting uptake capacity of up to 1.27 g g&#8722;1, which can be attributed to the formation of trihalide anion I2Cl&#8722; within the crystal cavity.








Abstract
Nonporous adaptive crystals (NACs) are crystalline nonporous materials that can undergo a structural adaptive phase transformation to accommodate specific guest via porous cavity or lattice voids. Most of the NACs are based on pillararenes because of their flexible backbone and intrinsic porous structure. Here a readily prepared organic hydrochloride of 4&#8208;(4&#8208;(diphenylamino)phenyl)pyridin&#8208;1&#8208;ium chloride (TPAPyH), exhibiting the solvent dimension&#8208;dependent adaptive crystallinity is reported. Wherein it forms a nonporous &#945; crystal in a solvent with larger dimensions, while forming two porous &#946; and &#947; crystals capable of accommodating solvent molecules in solvent with small size. Furthermore, the thermal&#8208;induced single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) transition from the &#946; to &#945; phase can be initiated. Upon exposure to iodine vapor or immersion in aqueous solution, the nonporous &#945; phase transforms to porous &#946; phase by adsorbing iodine molecules. Owing to the formation of trihalide anion I2Cl&#713; within the crystal cavity, TPAPyH exhibits remarkable performance in iodine storage, with a high uptaking capacity of 1.27 g g&#8722;1 and elevated iodine desorption temperature of up to 110 and 82&#160;&#176;C following the first and second adsorption stage. The unexpected adaptivity of TPAPyH inspires the design of NACs for selective adsorption and separation of volatile compound from organic small molecules.

         <title>Unconventional Dually&#8208;Mobile Superrepellent Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unconventional dually&#8208;mobile superrepellent surfaces are designed by combining rationally controlled surface textures and liquid&#8208;like surface chemistry, enabling droplets to keep highly mobile in both the Cassie and the Wenzel states. A theoretical model is established to explain the significantly reduced adhesion of Wenzel&#8208;state droplets, which aligns closely with the experimental findings.








Abstract
The ability of water droplets to move freely on superrepellent surfaces is a crucial feature that enables effective liquid repellency. Common superrepellent surfaces allow free motion of droplets in the Cassie state, with the liquid resting on the surface textures. However, liquid impalement into the textures generally leads to a wetting transition to the Wenzel state and droplet immobilization on the surface, thereby destroying the liquid repellency. This study reports the creation of a novel type of superrepellent surface through rational structural control combined with liquid&#8208;like surface chemistry, which allows for the free movement of water droplets and effective repellency in both the Cassie and Wenzel states. Theoretical guidelines for designing such surfaces are provided, and experimental results are consistent with theoretical analysis. Furthermore, this work demonstrates the enhanced ice resistance of the dually&#8208;mobile superrepellent surfaces, along with their distinctive self&#8208;cleaning capability to eliminate internal contaminants. This study expands the understanding of superrepellency and offers new possibilities for the development of repellent surfaces with exceptional anti&#8208;wetting properties.

         <title>Highly Reversible Positive&#8208;Valence Conversion of Sulfur Chemistry for High&#8208;Voltage Zinc&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly reversible S2&#8208;/S4+ redox behavior with up to six&#8208;electron transfer is achieved in zinc batteries based on the highly concentrated ClO4&#8722;&#8208;containing eutectic electrolyte, which can stabilize the positive&#8208;valence S compound. Notably, the achieved conversion process demonstrates the highest operation voltage achieved to date in Zn&#8214;S batteries and delivered remarkable electrochemical performance.








Abstract
Sulfur is a promising conversion&#8208;type cathode for zinc batteries (ZBs) due to its high discharge capacity and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, the redox conversion of multivalent S in ZBs is still limited, only having achieved S0/S2&#8722; redox conversion with low discharge voltage and poor reversibility. This study presents significant progress by demonstrating, for the first time, the reversible S2&#8722;/S4+ redox behavior in ZBs with up to six&#8208;electron transfer (with an achieved discharge capacity of &#8776;1284 mAh g&#8722;1) using a highly concentrated ClO4&#8722;&#8208;containing electrolyte. The developed succinonitrile&#8211;Zn(ClO4)2 eutectic electrolyte stabilizes the positive&#8208;valence S compound and contributes to an ultra&#8208;low polarization voltage. Notably, the achieved flat discharge plateaus demonstrate the highest operation voltage (1.54&#160;V) achieved to date in Zn&#8214;S batteries. Furthermore, the high&#8208;voltage Zn&#8214;S battery exhibits remarkable conversion dynamics, excellent cycling performance (85.7% capacity retention after 500 cycles), high efficiency (98.4%), and energy density (527&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#160;S&#8722;1). This strategy of positive&#8208;valence conversion of sulfur represents a significant advancement in understanding sulfur chemistry in batteries and holds promise for future high&#8208;voltage sulfur&#8208;based batteries.

         <title>Gate&#8208;Tunable Positive and Negative Photoconductance in Near&#8208;Infrared Organic Heterostructures for In&#8208;Sensor Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic heterostructure with a 5 &#181;m channel length is fabricated by a conventional photolithography technique. Intriguingly, by modulating gate voltage, both positive and negative photoresponses to near&#8208;infrared light are attained due to the photogating effect, making it ideal for efficient and precise in&#8208;sensor computing applications including image processing and nondestructive reading and classification.








Abstract
The rapid growth of sensor data in the artificial intelligence often causes significant reductions in processing speed and power efficiency. Addressing this challenge, in&#8208;sensor computing is introduced as an advanced sensor architecture that simultaneously senses, memorizes, and processes images at the sensor level. However, this is rarely reported for organic semiconductors that possess inherent flexibility and tunable bandgap. Herein, an organic heterostructure that exhibits a robust photoresponse to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light is introduced, making it ideal for in&#8208;sensor computing applications. This heterostructure, consisting of partially overlapping p&#8208;type and n&#8208;type organic thin films, is compatible with conventional photolithography techniques, allowing for high integration density of up to 520 devices cm&#8722;2 with a 5&#160;&#181;m channel length. Importantly, by modulating gate voltage, both positive and negative photoresponses to NIR light (1050&#160;nm) are attained, which establishes a linear correlation between responsivity and gate voltage and consequently enables real&#8208;time matrix multiplication within the sensor. As a result, this organic heterostructure facilitates efficient and precise NIR in&#8208;sensor computing, including image processing and nondestructive reading and classification, achieving a recognition accuracy of 97.06%. This work serves as a foundation for the development of reconfigurable and multifunctional NIR neuromorphic vision systems.

         <title>Efficient Deep&#8208;Blue Multiple&#8208;Resonance Emitters Based on Azepine&#8208;Decorated &#957;&#8208;DABNA for CIEy below 0.06</title>

Azepine&#8208;substituted &#957;&#8208;DABNA derivatives exhibit narrowband deep&#8208;blue emission with thermally activated delayed fluorescence properties owing to multiple&#8208;resonance (MR) effects. Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) that use these emitters simultaneously satisfy high color purity, quantum efficiency, luminous efficacy, and device durability, surpassing those reported in previous studies. The azepine unit shows great potential for enhancing the performance of OLEDs based on MR materials.








Abstract
Ultrapure deep&#8208;blue emitters are in high demand for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Although color coordinates serve as straightforward parameters for assessing color purity, precise control over the maximum wavelength and full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum is necessary to optimize OLED performance, including luminance efficiency and luminous efficacy. Multiple&#8208;resonance (MR) emitters are promising candidates for achieving ideal luminescence properties; consequently, a wide variety of MR frameworks have been developed. However, most of these emitters experience a wavelength displacement from the ideal color, which limits their practical applicability. Therefore, a molecular design that is compatible with MR emitters for modulating their energy levels and color output is particularly valuable. Here, it is demonstrated that the azepine donor unit induces an appropriate blue&#8208;shift in the emission maximum while maintaining efficient MR characteristics, including high photoluminescence quantum yield, narrow emission, and a fast reverse intersystem crossing rate. OLEDs using newly developed MR emitters based on the &#957;&#8208;DABNA framework simultaneously exhibit a high quantum efficiency of &#8776;30%, luminous efficacy of &#8776;20&#160;lm W&#8722;1, exceptional color purity with Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage coordinates as low as (0.14, 0.06), and notably high operational stability. These results demonstrate unprecedentedly high levels compared with those observed in previously reported deep&#8208;blue emitters.

         <title>Multicolor Inks of Black Phosphorus for Midwave&#8208;Infrared Optoelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable process of black phosphorus&#8208;based ink films for multicolored optoelectronic device applications in mid&#8208;infrared wavelength. Through the reduction of black phosphorus particle size distribution, the optical bandgap systematically blueshifts, reaching up to 0.8&#160;eV (&#955; = 1.5&#160;&#181;m). Conversely, alloying black phosphorus with arsenic induces a redshift in the bandgap to 0.28&#160;eV (&#955; = 4.4&#160;&#181;m).








Abstract
Black phosphorus (bP) based ink with a bulk bandgap of 0.33&#160;eV (&#955; = 3.7&#160;&#181;m) has recently been shown to be promising for large&#8208;area, high performance mid&#8208;wave infrared (MWIR) optoelectronics. However, the development of multicolor bP inks expanding across the MWIR wavelength range has been challenging. Here a multicolor ink process based on bP with spectral emission tuned from 0.28&#160;eV (&#955; = 4.4&#160;&#181;m) to 0.8&#160;eV (&#955; = 1.5&#160;&#181;m) is demonstrated. Specifically, through the reduction of bP particle size distribution (i.e., lateral dimension and thickness), the optical bandgap systematically blueshifts, reaching up to 0.8&#160;eV. Conversely, alloying bP with arsenic (bP1&#8722;xAsx) induces a redshift in the bandgap to 0.28&#160;eV. The ink processed films are passivated with an infrared&#8208;transparent epoxy for stable infrared emission in ambient air. Utilizing these multicolor bP&#8208;based inks as an infrared light source, a gas sensing system is demonstrated that selectively detects gases, such as CO2 and CH4 whose absorption band varies around 4.3 and 3.3&#160;&#181;m, respectively. The presented ink formulation sets the stage for the advancement of multiplex MWIR optoelectronics, including spectrometers and spectral imaging using a low&#8208;cost material processing platform.

         <title>Counter&#8208;Doping Effect by Trivalent Cations in Tin&#8208;Based Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trivalent antimony is used to counter&#8208;dope the oxidized Sn&#8208;based perovskite by replacing divalent tin in the crystal lattice. It effectively decreases the doping levels in tin halide perovskites down to 1014 cm&#8722;3, and meanwhile passivates deep&#8208;level defects induced by iodine vacancies. The resultant devices show a relative enhancement of 31.4% in the average efficiency as well as improved shelf&#8208;storage stability.








Abstract
Tin (Sn) &#8208;based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) normally show low open circuit voltage due to serious carrier recombination in the devices, which can be attributed to the oxidation and the resultant high p&#8208;type doping of the perovskite active layers. Considering the grand challenge to completely prohibit the oxidation of Sn&#8208;based perovskites, a feasible way to improve the device performance is to counter&#8208;dope the oxidized Sn&#8208;based perovskites by replacing Sn2+ with trivalent cations in the crystal lattice, which however is rarely reported. Here, the introduction of Sb3+, which can effectively counter&#8208;dope the oxidized perovskite layer and improve the carrier lifetime, is presented. Meanwhile, Sb3+ can passivate deep&#8208;level defects and improve carrier mobility of the perovskite layer, which are all favorable for the photovoltaic performance of the devices. Consequently, the target devices yield a relative enhancement of the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 31.4% as well as excellent shelf&#8208;storage stability. This work provides a novel strategy to improve the performance of Sn&#8208;based PSCs, which can be developed as a universal way to compensate for the oxidation of Sn&#8208;based perovskites in optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Controlled Growth Lateral/Vertical Heterostructure Interface for Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Black phosphorus (BP)/graphdiyne oxide (GDYO) lateral/vertical heterostructures are prepared via solid&#8208;state mechanochemistry. The sp2&#8208;hybridized mode P&#8208;C and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane P&#8208;O&#8208;C bonds realize the lateral and vertical connection, respectively. GDYO regulates the volume expansion of BP, provides active sites, and restrains the shuttle effect of LixPy. The heterostructures combine interface and structural engineering, demonstrating high&#8208;rate performance and long&#8208;term stability in lithium storage.








Abstract
Artificial heterostructures with structural advancements and customizable electronic interfaces are fundamental for achieving high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Here, a design idea for a covalently bonded lateral/vertical black phosphorus (BP)&#8208;graphdiyne oxide (GDYO) heterostructure achieved through a facile ball&#8208;milling approach, is designed. Lateral heterogeneity is realized by the sp2&#8208;hybridized mode P&#8208;C bonds, which connect the phosphorus atoms at the edges of BP with the carbon atoms of the terminal acetylene in GDYO. The vertical connection of the heterojunction of BP and GDYO is connected by P&#8208;O&#8208;C bond. Experimental and theoretical studies demonstrate that BP&#8208;GDYO incorporates interfacial and structural engineering features, including built&#8208;in electric fields, chemical bond interactions, and maximized nanospace confinement effects. Therefore, BP&#8208;GDYO exhibits improved electrochemical kinetics and enhanced structural stability. Moreover, through ex&#8208; and in&#8208;situ studies, the lithiation mechanism of BP&#8208;GDYO, highlighting that the introduction of GDYO inhibits the shuttle/dissolution effect of phosphorus intermediates, hinders volume expansion, provides more reactive sites, and ultimately promotes reversible lithium storage, is clarified. The BP&#8208;GDYO anode exhibits lithium storage performance with high&#8208;rate capacity and long&#8208;cycle stability (602.6 mAh g&#8722;1 after 1&#160;000 cycles at 2.0 A g&#8722;1). The proposed interfacial and structural engineering is universal and represents a conceptual advance in building high&#8208;performance LIBs electrode.

         <title>Activating Macrophage Continual Efferocytosis via Microenvironment Biomimetic Short Fibers for Reversing Inflammation in Bone Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Focusing on the suppressed macrophage efferocytosis in the overactivated inflammation microenvironment of refractory bone defect, this study combines biomimetic short&#8208;fiber matrixes with apoptosis&#8208;mimetic CeO2 nanoenzymes to mimic a healthy microenvironment, activating macrophage continuous efferocytosis through the trigger effect of apoptotic signals and intracellular oxidative stress regulation, ultimately achieving local inflammation reversal, and accelerating the bone repair process.








Abstract
Efferocytosis&#8208;mediated inflammatory reversal plays a crucial role in bone repairing process. However, in refractory bone defects, the macrophage continual efferocytosis may be suppressed due to the disrupted microenvironment homeostasis, particularly the loss of apoptotic signals and overactivation of intracellular oxidative stress. In this study, a polydopamine&#8208;coated short fiber matrix containing biomimetic &#8220;apoptotic signals&#8221; to reconstruct the microenvironment and reactivate macrophage continual efferocytosis for inflammatory reversal and bone defect repair is presented. The &#8220;apoptotic signals&#8221; (AM/CeO2) are prepared using CeO2 nanoenzymes with apoptotic neutrophil membrane coating for macrophage recognition and oxidative stress regulation. Additionally, a short fiber &#8220;biomimetic matrix&#8221; is utilized for loading AM/CeO2 signals via abundant adhesion sites involving &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and hydrogen bonding interactions. Ultimately, the implantable apoptosis&#8208;mimetic nanoenzyme/short&#8208;fiber matrixes (PFS@AM/CeO2), integrating apoptotic signals and biomimetic matrixes, are constructed to facilitate inflammatory reversal and reestablish the pro&#8208;efferocytosis microenvironment. In vitro and in vivo data indicate that the microenvironment biomimetic short fibers can activate macrophage continual efferocytosis, leading to the suppression of overactivated inflammation. The enhanced repair of rat femoral defect further demonstrates the osteogenic potential of the pro&#8208;efferocytosis strategy. It is believed that the regulation of macrophage efferocytosis through microenvironment biomimetic materials can provide a new perspective for tissue repair.

         <title>Topological Defect&#8208;Regulated Porous Carbon Anodes with Fast Interfacial and Bulk Kinetics for High&#8208;Rate and High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
Topologically defective porous carbon materials for high&#8208;rate and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) are successfully developed by thermal&#8208;driven atomic rearrangement strategy. The topological defects can effectively regulate the electronic structure of carbon skeleton, which simultaneously enables efficient&#160;potassium adsorption as well as fast solid&#8208;phase and interphase potassium diffusion.








Abstract
Carbonaceous materials are regarded as one of the most promising anodes for potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs), but their rate capabilities are largely limited by the slow solid&#8208;state potassium diffusion kinetics inside anode and sluggish interfacial potassium ion transfer process. Herein, high&#8208;rate and high&#8208;capacity PIBs are demonstrated by facile topological defect&#8208;regulation of the microstructure of carbon anodes. The carbon lattice of the as&#8208;obtained porous carbon nanosheets (CNSs) with abundant topological defects (TDPCNSs) holds relatively high&#160;potassium adsorption energy yet low potassium migration barrier, thereby enabling efficient storage and diffusion of potassium inside graphitic layers. Moreover, the topological defects can induce preferential decomposition of anions, leading to the formation of high potassium ion conductive solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film with decreased potassium ion de&#8208;solvation and transfer barrier. Additionally, the dominant sp2&#8208;hybridized carbon conjugated skeleton of TDPCNSs enables high electrical conductivity (39.4 S cm&#8722;1) and relatively low potassium storage potential. As a result, the as&#8208;constructed TDPCNSs anode demonstrates high potassium storage capacity (504&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1), remarkable rate capability (118&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 40 A g&#8722;1), as well as long&#8208;term cycling stability.

         <title>Construction and Observation of Flexibly Controllable High&#8208;Dimensional Non&#8208;Hermitian Skin Effects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intuitive bottom&#8208;to&#8208;top scheme is devised to flexibly construct and manipulate high&#8208;dimensional non&#8208;Hermitian skin effects. Two nonreciprocal acoustic metamaterials are experimentally implemented to realize multi&#8208;polar skin effects and hybrid skin&#8208;topological effects, where the sound fields can be frequency&#8208;selectively localized at any desired corners and boundaries. Such intriguing properties can boost advanced applications like selective filters and directional amplifiers.








Abstract
Non&#8208;Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) is one of the most fundamental phenomena in non&#8208;Hermitian physics. It is established that 1D NHSE originates from the nontrivial spectral winding topology. However, the topological origin behind the higher&#8208;dimensional NHSE remains unclear, which poses a substantial challenge in constructing and manipulating high&#8208;dimensional NHSEs. Here, an intuitive bottom&#8208;to&#8208;top scheme to construct high&#8208;dimensional NHSEs is proposed, through assembling multiple independent 1D NHSEs. Not only the elusive high&#8208;dimensional NHSEs can be effectively predicted from the well&#8208;defined 1D spectral winding topologies, but also the high&#8208;dimensional generalized Brillouin zones can be directly synthesized from the 1D counterparts. As examples, two 2D nonreciprocal acoustic metamaterials are experimentally implemented to demonstrate highly controllable multi&#8208;polar NHSEs and hybrid skin&#8208;topological effects, where the sound fields can be frequency&#8208;selectively localized at any desired corners and boundaries. These results offer a practicable strategy for engineering high&#8208;dimensional NHSEs, which can boost advanced applications such as selective filters and directional amplifiers.

         <title>Design of Fluorinated Elastomeric Electrolyte for Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries Operating at Low Temperature and High Voltage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fluorinated elastomeric electrolyte formed via polymerization&#8208;induced phase separation exhibits excellent ionic conductivity, mechanical resilience, and an ability to form stable interfaces at low temperatures, offering superior electrochemical performances of low&#8208;temperature and high&#8208;voltage operating solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries.








Abstract
This work demonstrates the low&#8208;temperature operation of solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (LMBs) through the development of a fluorinated and plastic&#8208;crystal&#8208;embedded elastomeric electrolyte (F&#8208;PCEE). The F&#8208;PCEE is formed via polymerization&#8208;induced phase separation between the polymer matrix and plastic crystal phase, offering a high mechanical strain (&#8776;300%) and ionic conductivity (&#8776;0.23 mS cm&#8722;1) at &#8722;10&#160;&#176;C. Notably, strong phase separation between two phases leads to the selective distribution of lithium (Li) salts within the plastic crystal phase, enabling superior elasticity and high ionic conductivity at low temperatures. The F&#8208;PCEE in a Li/LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 full cell maintains 74.4% and 42.5% of discharge capacity at &#8722;10&#160;&#176;C and &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C, respectively, compared to that at 25&#160;&#176;C. Furthermore, the full cell exhibits 85.3% capacity retention after 150 cycles at &#8722;10&#160;&#176;C and a high cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.5&#160;V, representing one of the highest cycling performances among the reported solid polymer electrolytes for low&#8208;temperature LMBs. This work attributes the prolonged cycling lifetime of F&#8208;PCEE at &#8722;10&#160;&#176;C to the great mechanical robustness to suppress the Li&#8208;dendrite growth and ability to form superior LiF&#8208;rich interphases. This study establishes the design strategies of elastomeric electrolytes for developing solid&#8208;state LMBs operating at low temperatures and high voltages.

         <title>Organic Solvent Boosts Charge Storage and Charging Dynamics of Conductive MOF Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The organic solvent functions synchronously as an &#8220;ionophobic agent&#8221; to induce a substantial enhancement in charge storage and as an &#8220;ion traffic police&#8221; to eliminate convoluted counterion and co&#8208;ion motion paths to create two distinct ion transport highways to accelerate charging dynamics, leading to a capacity enhancement of over 100% and an approximately sixfold increase in charging speed.








Abstract
Conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (c&#8208;MOFs) and ionic liquids (ILs) have emerged as auspicious combinations for high&#8208;performance supercapacitors. However, the nanoconfinement from c&#8208;MOFs and high viscosity of ILs slow down the charging process. This hindrance can, however, be resolved by adding solvent. Here, constant&#8208;potential molecular simulations are performed to scrutinize the solvent impact on charge storage and charging dynamics of MOF&#8208;IL&#8208;based supercapacitors. Conditions for &gt;100% enhancement in capacity and &#8776;6 times increase in charging speed are found. These improvements are confirmed by synthesizing near&#8208;ideal c&#8208;MOFs and developing multiscale models linking molecular simulations to electrochemical measurements. Fundamentally, the findings elucidate that the solvent acts as an &#8220;ionophobic agent&#8221; to induce a substantial enhancement in charge storage, and as an &#8220;ion traffic police&#8221; to eliminate convoluted counterion and co&#8208;ion motion paths and create two distinct ion transport highways to accelerate charging dynamics. This work paves the way for the optimal design of MOF supercapacitors.

         <title>Entanglement Added to Cross&#8208;Linked Chains Enables Tough Gelatin&#8208;Based Hydrogel for Zn Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;networked gelatin&#8208;based hydrogel (ODGelMA) electrolyte with an entanglement effect exhibits impressive mechanical features and high ionic conductivity. The hydrogel matrix circumvents dendrite growth and exposes a stable Zn anode surface, resulting in an outstanding average CE of 99.8%, cycling stability of 900&#160;h at 5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, and a stable work performance of a large&#8208;format pouch cell.








Abstract
Currently, it is still challenging to develop a hydrogel electrolyte matrix that can successfully achieve a harmonious combination of mechanical strength, ionic conductivity, and interfacial adaptability. Herein, a multi&#8208;networked hydrogel electrolyte with a high entanglement effect based on gelatin/oxidized dextran/methacrylic anhydride, denoted as ODGelMA is constructed. Attribute to the Schiff base network formulation of &#9472;RC&#9552;N&#9472;, oxidized dextran integrated gelatin chains induce a dense hydrophilic conformation group. Furthermore, addition of methacrylic anhydride through a grafting process, the entangled hydrogel achieves impressive mechanical features (6.8&#160;MPa tensile strength) and high ionic conductivity (3.68&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 at 20&#160;&#176;C). The ODGelMA electrolyte regulates the zinc electrode by circumventing dendrite growth, and showcases an adaptable framework reservoir to accelerate the Zn2+ desolvation process. Benefiting from the entanglement effect, the Zn anode achieves an outstanding average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.8% over 500 cycles and cycling stability of 900&#160;h at 5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and 2.5&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2. The Zn||I2 full cell yields an ultra&#8208;long cycling stability of 10&#160;000 cycles with a capacity retention of 92.4% at 5&#160;C. Furthermore, a 60&#160;mAh single&#8208;layer pouch cell maintains a stable work of 350 cycles.

         <title>Tandem Electric&#8208;Fields Prolong Energetic Hot Electrons Lifetime for Ultra&#8208;Fast and Stable NO2 Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of the surface plasmon resonance effect in the asymmetric structure of (111)/(100)CeO2 facet junction can form tandem electric fields, which prolong energetic hot electrons lifetimes and ensure a sufficient driving force for carriers transfer. The tandem electric fields enable the (111)/(100)Au&#8208;CeO2 to rapidly detect 5&#160;ppm of NO2 at room temperature with stability maintained within 20&#160;s.








Abstract
Prolonging energetic hot electrons lifetimes and surface activity in the reactive site can overcome the slow kinetics and unfavorable thermodynamics of photo&#8208;activated gas sensors. However, bulk and surface recombination limit the simultaneous optimization of both kinetics and thermodynamics. Here tandem electric fields are deployed at (111)/(100)Au&#8208;CeO2 to ensure a sufficient driving force for carrier transfer and elucidate the mechanism of the relationship between charge transport and gas&#8208;sensing performance. The asymmetric structure of the (111)/(100)CeO2 facet junction provides interior electric fields, which facilitates electron transfer from the (100)face to the (111)face. This separation of reduction and oxidation reaction sites across different crystal faces helps inhibit surface recombination. The increased electron concentration at the (111)face intensifies the interface electric field, which promotes electron transfer to the Au site. The local electric field generated by the surface plasmon resonance effect promotes the generation of high&#8208;energy energy hot&#8208;electrons, which maintains charge concentration in the interface field by injecting into (111)/(100)CeO2, thereby provide thermodynamic contributions and inhibit bulk recombination. The tandem electric fields enable the (111)/(100)Au&#8208;CeO2 to rapidly detect 5&#160;ppm of NO2 at room temperature with stability maintained within 20&#160;s.

         <title>A Vacancy&#8208;Engineering Ferroelectric Nanomedicine for Cuproptosis/Apoptosis Co&#8208;Activated Immunotherapy</title>

BCO&#8208;VCu induces apoptosis by triggering a burst of reactive oxygen species under ultrasound irradiation; it acts as a switch to reduce Cu+ efflux and alterations in proteins such as dihydrolipoic acid S&#8208;acetyltransferase, ferredoxin 1, inducing the occurrence of cuproptosis. More importantly, it triggers immunogenic cell death, which causes a strong immune response.








Abstract
Low efficacy of immunotherapy due to the poor immunogenicity of most tumors and their insufficient infiltration by immune cells highlights the importance of inducing immunogenic cell death and activating immune system for achieving better treatment outcomes. Herein, ferroelectric Bi2CuO4 nanoparticles with rich copper vacancies (named BCO&#8208;VCu) are rationally designed and engineered for ferroelectricity&#8208;enhanced apoptosis, cuproptosis, and the subsequently evoked immunotherapy. In this structure, the suppressed recombination of the electron&#8211;hole pairs by the vacancies and the band bending by the ferroelectric polarization lead to high catalytic activity, triggering reactive oxygen species bursts and inducing apoptosis. The cell fragments produced by apoptosis serve as antigens to activate T cells. Moreover, due to the generated charge by the ferroelectric catalysis, this nanomedicine can act as &#8220;a smart switch&#8221; to open the cell membrane, promote nanomaterial endocytosis, and shut down the Cu+ outflow pathway to evoke cuproptosis, and thus a strong immune response is triggered by the reduced content of adenosine triphosphate. Ribonucleic acid transcription tests reveal the pathways related to immune response activation. Thus, this study firstly demonstrates a feasible strategy for enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapy using single ferroelectric semiconductor&#8208;induced apoptosis and cuproptosis.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Step Redox Engineering of 2D CoNi&#8208;Alloy Embedded B, N&#8208;Doped Carbon Layers Toward Tunable Electromagnetic Wave Absorption and Light&#8208;Weight Infrared Stealth Heat Insulation Devices</title>

         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;step Redox engineering strategy is employed to construct a 2D CoNi&#8208;carbon layer (2D&#8208;CNC), which showed superior reflection loss (RLmin) of &#8722;60.1 dB and wide effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) of 6.24 GHz. Moreover, the assembled multifunctional 3D aerogel device displayed excellent light&#8208;weight, pressure&#8208;resistant, anti&#8208;corrosion, heat&#8208;insulating and infrared&#8208;stealthy capabilities.








Abstract
2D layered metallic graphite composites are promising electromagnetic wave absorption materials (EWAMs) for their combined properties of abundant interlayer free spaces, rich metallic polarized sites, and high conductivity, but the controllable synthesis remains rather challenging. Herein, a dual&#8208;step redox engineering strategy is developed by employing cobalt boron imidazolate framework (Co&#8208;BIF) to construct 2D CoNi&#8208;alloy embedded B, N&#8208;doped carbon layers (2D&#8208;CNC) as a promising EWAM. In the first step, a chemical etching oxidation process on Co&#8208;BIF is used to obtain an optimized 2D&#8208;CoNi&#8208;layered double hydroxide (2D&#8208;CoNi&#8208;LDH) intermediate and in the second, high&#8208;temperature calcination reduction is implemented to modify graphitization of the degree of the 2D&#8208;CNC. The obtained sample delivers superior reflection loss (RLmin) of &#8722;60.1&#160;dB and wide effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) of 6.24&#160;GHz. The synergy mechanisms of interfacial/dipole polarization and magnetic coupling are in&#8208;depth evidenced by the hologram and Lorentz electron microscopy, revealing its significant contribution on multireflection and impedance matching. Further theoretical evaluation by COMSOL simulation in different fields based on the dynamic loss process toward the test ring reveals the in situ EW attenuation process. This work presents a strategy to develop multifunctional light&#8208;weight infrared stealthy aerogel with superior pressure&#8208;resistant, anti&#8208;corrosion, and heat&#8208;insulating properties for future applications.

         <title>Freestanding Ammonium Vanadate Composite Cathodes with Lattice Self&#8208;Regulation and Ion Exchange for Long&#8208;Lasting Ca&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

Vanadium oxides are particularly attractive as cathode materials for calcium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the cycling lifespan of vanadium oxides in organic electrolytes at room temperature still falls short of 1000 cycles. Here, the calcium storage performance of vanadium oxides is improved by electrode and electrolyte engineering and the cycling lifespan of vanadium oxides is increased from 1000 to 10&#160;000 cycles.








Abstract
Calcium&#8208;ion batteries (CIBs) have emerged as a promising alternative for electrochemical energy storage. The lack of high&#8208;performance cathode materials severely limits the development of CIBs. Vanadium oxides are particularly attractive as cathode materials for CIBs, and preinsertion chemistry is often used to improve their calcium storage performance. However, the room temperature cycling lifespan of vanadium oxides in organic electrolytes still falls short of 1000 cycles. Here, based on preinsertion chemistry, the cycling life of vanadium oxides is further improved by integrated electrode and electrolyte engineering. Utilizing a tailored Ca electrolyte, the constructed freestanding (NH4)2V6O16&#183;1.35H2O@graphene oxide@carbon nanotube (NHVO&#8208;H@GO@CNT) composite cathode achieves a 305 mAh g&#8722;1 high capacity and 10&#160;000 cycles record&#8208;long life. Additionally, for the first time, a Ca&#8208;ion hybrid capacitor full cell is assembled and delivers a capacity of 62.8 mAh g&#8722;1. The calcium storage mechanism of NHVO&#8208;H@GO@CNT based on a two&#8208;phase reaction and the exchange of NH4+ and Ca2+ during cycling are revealed. The lattice self&#8208;regulation of V&#9472;O layers is observed and the layered vanadium oxides with Ca2+ pillars formed by ion exchange exhibit higher capacity. This work provides novel strategies to enhance the calcium storage performance of vanadium oxides via integrated structural design of electrodes and electrolyte modification.

         <title>Stereoscopic Polymer Network for Developing Mechanically Robust Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells with an Efficiency Approaching 25%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>

Employing a crosslinked molecule with three stereoscopic crosslink sites, pentaerythritol triacrylate, to establish a stereoscopic polymer network in both interface and bulk perovskite. This network effectively reduces cracks and delamination in flexible devices under high mechanical stress. Consequently, the cell retained 92% of its initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) after 20,000 bending cycles, and demonstrated a record PCE of 24.9%.








Abstract
Flexible perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs) have the potential to overturn the application scenario of silicon photovoltaic technology. However, their mechanical instability severely impedes their practical applicability, and the corresponding intrinsic degradation mechanism remains unclear. In this study, the degradation behavior of flexible pero&#8208;SCs is systematically analyzed under mechanical stress and it is observed that the structural failure first occurs in the polycrystal perovskite film, then extend to interfaces. To suppress the structural failure, pentaerythritol triacrylate, a crosslinked molecule with three stereoscopic crosslink sites, is employed to establish a 3D polymer network in both the interface and bulk perovskite. This network reduced the Young's modulus of the perovskite and simultaneously enhanced the interfacial toughness. As a result, the formation of cracks and delamination, which occur under a high mechanical stress, is significantly suppressed in the flexible pero&#8208;SC, which consequently retained 92% of its initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) after 20&#160;000 bending cycles. Notably, the flexible device also shows a record PCE of 24.9% (certified 24.48%).

Fabricating Li metal anodes with specific crystal plane is considered as a promising strategy for suppressing the growth of Li dendrites, but a simple and high&#8208;efficient approach is still lacking. Herein, a facile and controllable way for tailoring polished Li metal anodes with highly preferred (110) and (200) crystal orientation by regulating the times of accumulative roll bonding, is reported.








Abstract
A formidable challenge to achieve the practical applications of rechargeable lithium (Li) metal batteries (RLMBs) is to suppress the uncontrollable growth of Li dendrites. One of the most effective solutions is to fabricate Li metal anodes with specific crystal plane, but still lack of a simple and high&#8208;efficient approach. Herein, a facile and controllable way for the scalable customization of polished Li metal anodes with highly preferred (110) and (200) crystallographic orientation (donating as polished Li(110) and polished Li(200), respectively) by regulating the times of accumulative roll bonding, is reported. According to the inherent characteristics of polished Li(110)/Li(200), the influence of Li atomic structure on the electrochemical performance of RLMBs is deeply elucidated by combining theoretical calculations with relative experimental proofs. In particular, a polished Li(110) crystal plane is demonstrated to induce Li+ uniform deposition, promoting the formation of flat and dense Li deposits. Impressively, the polished Li(110)||LiFePO4 full cells exhibit unprecedented cycling stability with 10&#160;000 cycles at 10 C almost without capacity degradation, indicating the great potential application prospect of such textured Li metal. More valuably, this work provides an important reference for low&#8208;cost, continued, and large&#8208;scale production of Li metal anodes with highly preferred crystal orientation through roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll manufacturability.

         <title>The Defects Genome of Janus Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D Janus TMDs have garnered significant attention for their quantum properties, stemming from their unique asymmetric structure. This work identifies the most stable point defects in Janus WSeS${\mathrm{W}}_{{\mathrm{Se}}}^{\mathrm{S}}$ using HR&#8208;STEM, DFT, and PL spectroscopy, and establishes their impact on structural and optical properties. The findings introduce a defect genome for Janus TMDs, providing essential guidelines for assessing their structural quality and device functionality.








Abstract
2D Janus Transition Metal Dichalcogenides (TMDs) have attracted much interest due to their exciting quantum properties arising from their unique two&#8208;faced structure, broken&#8208;mirror symmetry, and consequent colossal polarization field within the monolayer. While efforts are made to achieve high&#8208;quality Janus monolayers, the existing methods rely on highly energetic processes that introduce unwanted grain&#8208;boundary and point defects with still unexplored effects on the material's structural and excitonic properties Through high&#8208;resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM), density functional theory (DFT), and optical spectroscopy measurements; this work introduces the most encountered and energetically stable point defects. It establishes their impact on the material's optical properties. HRSTEM studies show that the most energetically stable point defects are single (VS&#8197;and VSe) and double chalcogen vacancy (VS &#8722;VSe), interstitial defects (Mi), and metal impurities (MW) and establish their structural characteristics. DFT further establishes their formation energies and related localized bands within the forbidden band. Cryogenic excitonic studies on h&#8208;BN&#8208;encapsulated Janus monolayers offer a clear correlation between these structural defects and observed emission features, which closely align with the results of the theory. The overall results introduce the defect genome of Janus TMDs as an essential guideline for assessing their structural quality and device properties.

         <title>Solar&#8208;Driven Conversion of CO2 to C2 Products by the 3d Transition Metal Intercalates of Layered Lead Iodides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H5OH conversion is realized by tailoring the structure of layered lead iodide by coordination chemistry, introducing interlamellar redox&#8208;active Co2+/Ni2+ centers at the atomic&#8208;precision level. The heterobimetallic Pb&#8211;O&#8211;Co/Ni species are found to not only facilitate interlayer carrier transport, but also achieve charge&#8208;polarized active sites to promote C&#8211;C coupling.








Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction to high&#8208;value&#8208;added C2+ products presents significant challenges, which is attributed to the slow kinetics of multi&#8208;e&#8722; CO2 photoreduction and the high thermodynamic barrier for C&#8211;C coupling. Incorporating redox&#8208;active Co2+/Ni2+ cations into lead halide photocatalysts has high potentials to improve carrier transport and introduce charge polarized bimetallic sites, addressing the kinetic and thermodynamic issues, respectively. In this study, a coordination&#8208;driven synthetic strategy is developed to introduce 3d transition metals into the interlamellar region of layered organolead iodides with atomic precision. The resultant bimetallic halide hybrids exhibit selective photoreduction of CO2 to C2H5OH using H2O vapor at the evolution rates of 24.9&#8211;31.4&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 and high selectivity of 89.5&#8211;93.6%, while pristine layered lead iodide yields only C1 products. Band structure calculations and photoluminescence studies indicate that the interlayer Co2+/Ni2+ species greatly contribute to the frontier orbitals and enhance exciton dissociation into free carriers, facilitating carrier transport between adjacent lead iodide layers. In addition, Bader charge distribution calculations and in situ experimental spectroscopic studies reveal that the asymmetric Ni&#8211;O&#8211;Pb bimetallic catalytic sites exhibit intrinsic charge polarization, promoting C&#8211;C coupling and leading to the formation of the key *OC&#8211;CHO intermediate.

         <title>Transdermal Sensing of Enzyme Biomarker Enabled by Chemo&#8208;Responsive Probe&#8208;Modified Epidermal Microneedle Patch in Human Skin Tissue</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wearable bioelectronics marks a substantial leap forward in healthcare applications, particularly biosensing, providing an alternative approach to monitoring individual health. The methodology and design presented herein underscore the transformative impact of wearable microneedle technologies in combination with target&#8208;specific smart chemo&#8208;responsive probes on personalized healthcare, emphasizing their role in transdermal sensing and early intervention in melanoma management.








Abstract
Wearable bioelectronics represents a significant breakthrough in healthcare settings, particularly in (bio)sensing which offers an alternative way to track individual health for diagnostics and therapy. However, there has been no notable improvement in the field of cancer, particularly for skin cancer. Here, a wearable bioelectronic patch is established for transdermal sensing of the melanoma biomarker, tyrosinase (Tyr), using a microneedle array integrated with a surface&#8208;bound chemo&#8208;responsive smart probe to enable target&#8208;specific electrochemical detection of Tyr directly from human skin tissue. The results presented herein demonstrate the feasibility of a transdermal microneedle sensor for direct quantification of enzyme biomarkers in an ex vivo skin model. Initial performance analysis of the transdermal microneedle sensor proves that the designed methodology can be an alternative for fast and reliable diagnosis of melanoma and the evaluation of skin moles. The innovative approach presented here may revolutionize the landscape of skin monitoring by offering a nondisruptive means for continuous surveillance and timely intervention of skin anomalies, such as inflammatory skin diseases or allergies and can be extended to the screening of multiple responses of complementary biomarkers with simple modification in device design.

         <title>Wetting Transparency of Single&#8208;Layer Graphene on Liquid Substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Graphene's Wetting Transparency: A Liquid Interface Study &#8211; This compelling digital visualization showcases a single&#8208;layer graphene sheet's interaction with a submerged organic droplet. The graphene, almost optically transparent, conforms to the liquid surface, offering a vivid display of surface tension and intermolecular forces at play between the droplet, graphene, and the liquid substrate.&#8221;








Abstract
Graphene's wetting transparency offers promising avenues for creating multifunctional devices by allowing real&#8208;time wettability control on liquid substrates via the flow of different liquids beneath graphene. Despite its potential, direct measurement of floating graphene's wettability remains a challenge, hindering the exploration of these applications. The current study develops an experimental methodology to assess the wetting transparency of single&#8208;layer graphene (SLG) on liquid substrates. By employing contact angle measurements and Neumann's Triangle model, the challenge of evaluating the wettability of floating free&#8208;suspended single&#8208;layer graphene is addressed. The research reveals that for successful contact angle measurements, the testing and substrate liquids must be immiscible. Using diiodomethane as the testing liquid and ammonium persulfate solution as liquid substrate, the study demonstrates the near&#8208;complete wetting transparency of graphene. Furthermore, it successfully showcases the feasibility of real&#8208;time wettability control using graphene on liquid substrates. This work not only advances the understanding of graphene's interaction with liquid interfaces but also suggests a new avenue for the development of multifunctional materials and devices by exploiting the unique wetting transparency of graphene.

         <title>Tailorable Multi&#8208;Modular Pore&#8208;Space&#8208;Partitioned Vanadium Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of vanadium metal&#8208;organic framework materials based on high&#8208;connected trigonal planar vanadium&#8208;oxygen trimers are synthesized in large&#8208;enough size suitable for single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. These V&#8208;MOFs show a broad range of structural features, tailorable pore size and shape, tunable sorption properties and are promising for gas storage and separation applications such as purification of acetylene, ethylene, and propylene.








Abstract
Currently, few porous vanadium metal&#8208;organic frameworks (V&#8208;MOFs) are known and even fewer are obtainable as single crystals, resulting in limited information on their structures and properties. Here this work demonstrates remarkable promise of V&#8208;MOFs by presenting an extensible family of V&#8208;MOFs with tailorable pore geometry and properties. The synthesis leverages inter&#8208;modular synergy on a tri&#8208;modular pore&#8208;partitioned platform. New V&#8208;MOFs show a broad range of structural features and sorption properties suitable for gas storage and separation applications for C2H2/CO2, C2H6/C2H4, and C3H8/C3H6. The c/a ratio of the hexagonal cell, a measure of pore shape, is tunable from 0.612 to 1.258. Other tunable properties include pore size from 5.0 to 10.9 &#197; and surface area from 820 to 2964 m2 g&#8722;1. With C2H2/CO2 selectivity from 3.3 to 11 and high uptake capacity for C2H2 from 65.2 to 182 cm3 g&#8722;1 (298K, 1&#160;bar), an efficient separation is confirmed by breakthrough experiments. The near&#8208;record high uptake for C2H6 (166.8 cm3 g&#8722;1) contributes to the promise for C2H6&#8208;selective separation of C2H6/C2H4. The multi&#8208;module pore expansion enables transition from C3H6&#8208;selective to more desirable C3H8&#8208;selective separation with extraordinarily high C3H8 uptake (254.9 cm3 g&#8722;1) and high separation potential (1.25&#160;mmol g&#8722;1) for C3H8/C3H6 (50:50 v/v) mixture.

         <title>Tailor&#8208;Made Doses of Pharmaceuticals by Tunable Modular Design: A Case Study on Tapering Antidepressant Medication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tunable modular design (TMD) is proposed as a fast and accurate method for tapering of an antidepressant, such as citalopram hydrobromide (CHB). TMD combines a porous polymer structure (a module) and inkjet printing to provide a flexible platform for producing a wide range of CHB doses. The TMD outperforms the conventional self&#8208;tapering method by manually dividing commercially available CHB tablets.








Abstract
An abrupt cessation of antidepressant medication can be challenging due to the appearance of withdrawal symptoms. A slow hyperbolic tapering of an antidepressant, such as citalopram hydrobromide (CHB), can mitigate the withdrawal syndrome. However, there are no viable dosage forms on the market to implement the tapering scheme. A solution using a tunable modular design (TMD) approach to produce flexible and accurate doses of CHB is proposed. This design consists of two parts: 1) a module with a fixed amount of preloaded CHB in a freeze&#8208;dried polymer matrix, and 2) fine&#8208;tuning the CHB dose by inkjet printing. A noncontact food&#8208;grade printer, used for the first time for printing pharmaceuticals, is modified to allow for accurate printing of the highly concentrated CHB ink on the porous CHB&#8208;free or CHB&#8208;preloaded modules. The produced modules with submilligram precision are bench&#8208;marked with commercially available CHB tablets that are manually divided. The TMD covers the entire range of doses needed for the tapering (0.5&#8211;23.8&#160;mg). The greatest variance is 13% and 88% when comparing the TMD and self&#8208;tapering, respectively. Self&#8208;tapering is proven inaccurate and showcases the need for the TMD to make available accurate and personalized doses to wean off treatment with CHB.

         <title>Superdurable Full&#8208;Life Superhydrophobic Composite Block</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel superdurable full&#8208;life superhydrophobic composite block is developed through the insertion of near&#8208;zero contractive silica aerogel into a rigid iron&#8208;nickel foam structure. The collaborative reinforcement between the aerogel nanofiller and the rigid microskeleton introduces a pioneering methodology for crafting superhydrophobic materials capable of withstanding severe conditions, notably high temperatures, humidity levels, pressure differentials, and abrasive environments.








Abstract
Superhydrophobic materials are attractive for industrial development but plagued by poor mechanical stability. Herein, a superdurable full&#8208;life superhydrophobic composite block is designed and fabricated by embedding near&#8208;zero contractive superhydrophobic silica aerogel into a rigid iron&#8208;nickel foam structured similarly to a regular dodecahedron. The synergistic protection afforded by these materials ensures superrobust mechanical stability for the composite block, which features a high compressive strength of up to &#8776;7.4&#160;MPa, and ultralow Taber abrasion of down to &#8776;0.567&#160;mm after withstanding 50&#160;000 cycles, and highly efficient water harvesting capability of up to &#8776;3114.3&#160;mg min&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at a supercooling degree of 40 K. This robust material system provides a novel strategy to design superhydrophobic materials capable of withstanding extreme conditions, including high temperature, humidity, pressure, and abrasion.

         <title>A Rational Design of Bio&#8208;Derived Disulfide CANs for Wearable Capacitive Pressure Sensor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept work of an elastic dynamic adaptive polymer(disulfide) decorated with H bonds and metal&#8208;catechol complexations to construct into a sandwich&#8208;like, self&#8208;healable, closed&#8208;loop recyclable capacitive sensor with ultra&#8208;high sensitivity, decent stability, and the capability of monitoring various human motions on a real&#8208;time basis.








Abstract
Classic approaches to integrate flexible capacitive sensor performance are to on&#8208;demand microstructuring dielectric layers and to adjust dielectric material compositions via the introduction of insoluble carbon additives (to increase sensitivity) or dynamic interactions (to achieve self&#8208;healing).

&lt;p&gt;It is a proof-of-concept work of an elastic dynamic adaptive polymer(disulfide) decorated with H bonds and metal-catechol complexations to construct into a sandwich-like, self-healable, closed-loop recyclable capacitive sensor with ultra-high sensitivity, decent stability, and the capability of monitoring various human motions on a real-time basis.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Classic approaches to integrate flexible capacitive sensor performance are to on-demand microstructuring dielectric layers and to adjust dielectric material compositions via the introduction of insoluble carbon additives (to increase sensitivity) or dynamic interactions (to achieve self-healing). However, the sensor's enhanced performances often come with increased material complexity, discouraging its circular economy. Herein, a new intrinsic self-healable, closed-loop recyclable dielectric layer material, a fully nature-derived dynamic covalent poly(disulfide) decorated with rich H bonding and metal-catechol complexations is introduced. The polymer network possesses a mechanically ductile character with an Arrhenius-type temperature-dependent viscoelasticity. The assembled capacitive pressure sensor is able to achieve a sensitivity of up to 9.26&#160;kPa&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, fast response/recovery time of 32/24&#160;ms, and can deliver consistent signals of continuous consecutive cycles even after being self-healed or closed-loop recycled for real-time detection of human motions. This is expected to be of high interest for current capacitive sensing research to move toward a life-like, high performance, and circular economy direction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structural Evolution of Liquid Metals and Alloys</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study, using small angle neutron scattering and molecular dynamics simulations, uncovers the structured nature of commonly used liquid metal solvents such as EGaIn and Galinstan even under high temperatures. This contradicts the previous belief of their homogenous fluidity and contrasts their absence in 1, 2 and 5 wt% GaSn, 1, 2 and 5 wt% GaIn, and Ga.








Abstract
Low&#8208;melting liquid metals are emerging as a new group of highly functional solvents due to their capability to dissolve and alloy various metals in their elemental state to form solutions as well as colloidal systems. Furthermore, these liquid metals can facilitate and catalyze multiple unique chemical reactions. Despite the intriguing science behind liquid metals and alloys, very little is known about their fundamental structures in the nanometric regime. To bridge this gap, this work employs small angle neutron scattering and molecular dynamics simulations, revealing that the most commonly used liquid metal solvents, EGaIn and Galinstan, are surprisingly structured with the formation of clusters ranging from 157&#160;to 15.7&#160;&#197;. Conversely, noneutectic liquid metal alloys of GaSn or GaIn at low solute concentrations of 1, 2, and 5 wt%, as well as pure Ga, do not exhibit these structures. Importantly, the eutectic alloys retain their structure even at elevated temperatures of 60 and 90&#160;&#176;C, highlighting that they are not just simple homogeneous fluids consisting of individual atoms. Understanding the complex soft structure of liquid alloys will assist in comprehending complex phenomena occurring within these fluids and contribute to deriving reaction mechanisms in the realm of synthesis and liquid metal&#8208;based catalysis.

         <title>Physical&#8208;Entanglements&#8208;Supported Polymeric Form Stable Phase Change Materials with Ultrahigh Melting Enthalpy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, based on polymer viscoelasticity and crystallization theories, a novel and easy strategy preparing a kind of physical&#8208;entanglements&#8208;supported form stable phase change materials with ultrahigh melting enthalpy (up to 185 J g&#8722;1) is reported by solution mixing ultrahigh molecular weight of polyethylene oxide and its chemical identical oligomer polyethylene glycols.








Abstract
With the rapid development of new energy and the upgrading of electronic devices, structurally stable phase change materials (PCMs) have attracted widespread attentions from both academia and industries. Traditional cross&#8208;linking, composites, or microencapsulation methods for preparation of form stable PCMs usually sacrifice part of the phase change enthalpy and recyclability. Based on the basic polymer viscoelasticity and crystallization theories, here, a kind of novel recyclable polymeric PCM is developed by simple solution mixing ultrahigh molecular weight of polyethylene oxide (UHMWPEO) with its chemical identical oligomer polyethylene glycol (PEG). Rheological and leakage&#8208;proof experiments confirm that, even containing 90% of phase change fraction PEG oligomers, long&#8208;term of structure stability of PCMs can be achieved when the molecular weight of UHMWPEO is higher than 7000&#160;kg mol&#8722;1 due to their ultralong terminal relaxation time and large number of entanglements per chain. Furthermore, because of the reduced overall entanglement concentration, phase change enthalpy of PCMs can be greatly promoted, even reaching to &#8776;185 J g&#8722;1, which is larger than any PEG&#8208;based form stable PCMs in literatures. This work provides a new strategy and mechanism for designing physical&#8208;entanglements&#8208;supported form stable PCMs with ultrahigh phase change enthalpies.

         <title>2D Janus Polarization Functioned by Mechanical Force</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D polarization materials are promising for miniaturized devices due to their unique properties. However, strategies for creating 2D polarization through new mechanisms are rare. This work introduces a 2D Janus structure with both vertical and planar polarization, achieved by applying force with a nanoprobe. This technique breaks symmetry at the atomic level, inducing polarization and paving the way for new 2D polarization materials' development and design.








Abstract
2D&#160;polarization materials have emerged as promising candidates for meeting the demands of device miniaturization, attributed to their unique electronic configurations and transport characteristics. Although the existing inherent and sliding mechanisms are increasingly investigated in recent years, strategies for inducing 2D polarization with innovative mechanisms remain rare. This study introduces a novel 2D Janus state by modulating the puckered structure. Combining scanning probe microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and density functional theory calculations, this work realizes force&#8208;triggered out&#8208;of&#8208;plane and in&#8208;plane dipoles with distorted smaller warping in GeSe. The Janus state is preserved after removing the external mechanical perturbation, which could be switched by modulating the sliding direction. This work offers a versatile method to break the space inversion symmetry in a 2D system to trigger polarization in the atomic scale, which may open an innovative insight into configuring novel 2D polarization materials.

Herein, core&#8211;shell catalytic cathode materials of HC@FeNC featuring single&#8208;atom Fe&#8208;NC wrapped high&#8208;surface&#8208;area carbon effectively catalyze the I&#8722;/I3&#8722;/I&#176; conversion along with the strong polyiodide anchoring caused by Fe&#8211;N4 sites within porous carbon matrix.

Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8211;iodine (Zn&#8211;I2) conversion batteries with iodine redox chemistry suffers the severe polyiodide shuttling and sluggish redox kinetics, which impede the battery lifespan and rate capability. Herein, an ultrastable Zn&#8211;I2 battery is introduced based on single&#8208;atom Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C encapsulated high&#8208;surface&#8208;area carbon (HC@FeNC) as the core&#8211;shell cathode materials, which accelerate the I&#8722;/I3&#8722;/I&#176; conversion significantly. The robust chemical&#8211;physical interaction between polyiodides and Fe&#8211;N4 sites tightly binds the polyiodide ions and suppresses the polyiodide shuttling, thereby significantly enhancing the coulombic efficiency. As a result, the core&#8211;shell HC@FeNC cathode endows the electrolytic Zn&#8211;I2 battery with an excellent capacity, remarkable rate capability, and an ultralong lifespan over 60&#160;000 cycles. More importantly, a practical 253&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 pouch cell shows good capacity retention of 84% after 100 cycles, underscoring its considerable potential for commercial Zn&#8211;I2 batteries.

         <title>Boosting Upconversion Efficiency in Optically Inert Shelled Structures with Electroactive Membrane through Electron Donation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electroactive membranes, derived from Shewanella oneidensis MR&#8208;1 bacteria, are incorporated into membrane&#8208;integrated liposomes (MILs), encapsulating core&#8211;shell upconversion nanoparticles (CS UCNPs) with an optically inert shell. CS UCNP@MIL exhibits enhanced upconversion emission. This enhancement process is facilitated by electron donation from the electroactive membrane through the optically inactive shell to the UCNPs and is supported by theoretical calculations and experimental evidence.








Abstract
This study innovatively addresses challenges in enhancing upconversion efficiency in lanthanide&#8208;based nanoparticles (UCNPs) by exploiting Shewanella oneidensis MR&#8208;1, a microorganism capable of extracellular electron transfer. Electroactive membranes, rich in c&#8208;type cytochromes, are extracted from bacteria and integrated into membrane&#8208;integrated liposomes (MILs), encapsulating core&#8211;shelled UCNPs with an optically inactive shell, forming UCNP@MIL constructs. The electroactive membrane, tailored to donate electrons through the inert shell, independently boosts upconversion emission under near&#8208;infrared excitation (980 or 1550&#160;nm), bypassing ligand&#8208;sensitized UCNPs. The optically inactive shell restricts energy migration, emphasizing electroactive membrane electron donation. Density functional theory calculations elucidate efficient electron transfer due to the electroactive membrane hemes' highest occupied molecular orbital being higher than the valence band maximum of the optically inactive shell, crucial for enhancing energy transfer to emitter ions. The introduction of a SiO2 insulator coating diminishes light enhancement, underscoring the importance of unimpeded electron transfer. Luminescence enhancement remains resilient to variations in emitter or sensitizing ions, highlighting the robustness of the electron transfer&#8208;induced phenomenon. However, altering the inert shell material diminishes enhancement, emphasizing the role of electron transfer. This methodology holds significant promise for diverse biological applications. UCNP@MIL offers an advantage in cellular uptake, which proves beneficial for cell imaging.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Prussian Blue Analogues Enable Lattice Respiration for Ultrastable Aqueous Aluminum&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To overcome the inherent incompatibility between high&#8208;charge&#8208;density Al3+ and conventional cathode materials in AAIBs, this work proposes a novel family of high&#8208;entropy Prussian blue analogs (HEPBAs) with a unique lattice &#8220;respiration&#8221; characteristic and efficient multipath electron transfer. The optimized HEPBAs achieve one of the best long&#8208;term stabilities in AAIBs (91.2% capacity retention after 10&#8239;000 cycles at 5.0 A g&#8722;1).








Abstract
Aqueous aluminum ion batteries (AAIBs) hold significant potential for grid&#8208;scale energy storage owing to their intrinsic safety, high theoretical capacity, and abundance of aluminum. However, the strong electrostatic interactions and delayed charge compensation between high&#8208;charge&#8208;density aluminum ions and the fixed lattice in conventional cathodes impede the development of high&#8208;performance AAIBs. To address this issue, this work introduces, for the first time, high&#8208;entropy Prussian blue analogs (HEPBAs) as cathodes in AAIBs with unique lattice tolerance and efficient multipath electron transfer. Benefiting from the intrinsic long&#8208;range disorder and robust lattice strain field, HEPBAs enable the manifestation of the lattice respiration effect and minimize lattice volume changes, thereby achieving one of the best long&#8208;term stabilities (91.2% capacity retention after 10&#160;000 cycles at 5.0 A g&#8722;1) in AAIBs. Additionally, the interaction between the diverse metal atoms generates a broadened d&#8208;band and reduced degeneracy compared with conventional Prussian blue and its analogs (PBAs), which enhances the electron transfer efficiency with one of the best rate performance (79.2 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5.0 A g&#8722;1) in AAIBs. Furthermore, exceptional element selectivity in HEPBAs with unique cocktail effect can facile tune electrochemical behavior. Overall, the newly developed HEPBAs with a high&#8208;entropy effect exhibit promising solutions for advancing AAIBs and multivalent&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Nanogalvanic Cells Release Highly Reactive Electrons in Tumors to Effectively Eliminate Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanogalvanic cells that can continuously release highly reactive electrons to tumors in the tumor microenvironment have been developed. These electrons can react with surrounding biomolecules within tumors, not only destroying these molecules but also generating highly cytotoxic reactive species independent of oxygen to kill cancer cells. This innovative therapy effectively eliminates tumors and provides immune surveillance for cured mice.








Abstract
External stimuli triggering chemical reactions in cancer cells to generate highly reactive chemical species are very appealing for cancer therapy, in which external irradiation activating sensitizers to transfer energy or electrons to surrounding oxygen or other molecules is critical for generating cytotoxic reactive species. However, poor light penetration into tissue, low activity of sensitizers, and reliance on oxygen supply restrict the generation of cytotoxic chemical species in hypoxic tumors, which lowers the therapeutic efficacy. Here, this work presents galvanic cell nanomaterials that can directly release highly reactive electrons in tumors without external irradiation or photosensitizers. The released reactive electrons directly react with surrounding biomolecules such as proteins and DNA within tumors to destroy them or react with other surrounding (bio)molecules to yield cytotoxic chemical species to eliminate tumors independent of oxygen. Administering these nanogalvanic cells to mice results in almost complete remission of subcutaneous solid tumors and deep metastatic tumors. The results demonstrate that this strategy can further arouse an immune response even in a hypoxic environment. This method offers a promising approach to effectively eliminate tumors, similar to photodynamic therapy, but does not require oxygen or irradiation to activate photosensitizers.

         <title>Metallic Ru&#9472;Ru Interaction in Ruthenium Oxide Enabling Durable Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique RuO2 catalyst containing metallic Ru&#9472;Ru interactions (m&#8208;RuO2) is developed, which demonstrates great stability in proton exchange membrane water electrolysis. The under&#8208;coordinate Ru species are stabilized and the energy barrier for Ru dissolution is increased due to the presence of Ru&#9472;Ru interactions. These results highlight the significance of local coordination structure modulation in developing robust electrocatalysts.








Abstract
Developing efficient and robust electrocatalysts toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is critical for proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE). RuO2 possesses intrinsically high OER activity, but the concurrent electrochemical dissolution leads to rapid deactivation. Here a unique RuO2 catalyst containing metallic Ru&#9472;Ru interactions (m&#8208;RuO2) is reported, which maintains stability in practical PEMWE for 100&#160;h at 60 &#176;C and 1 A cm&#8722;2. Experimental and theoretical investigations suggest that the presence of Ru&#9472;Ru interactions significantly increases the energy barrier for the formation of RuO2(OH)2, which is a key intermediate for Ru dissolution, and hence substantially mitigates the electrochemical corrosion of m&#8208;RuO2. Meanwhile, the Ru4d band center downshifts, accordingly, ensuring the high OER activity, and the participation of lattice oxygen in the OER is also suppressed at the Ru&#9472;Ru sites, further contributing to the enhanced durability. Interestingly, such enhanced stability is also dependent on the size of metallic Ru&#9472;Ru cluster, where the energy barrier is further increased for Ru3, but is decreased for Ru5. These results highlight the significance of local coordination structure modulation on the electrochemical stability of RuO2 and open a feasible avenue toward the development of robust OER electrocatalysts for high&#8208;performance PEMWE.

         <dc:description>
The relationships between synthesis&#8208;structure&#8211;properties are unraveled based on Mantel test, correlation analysis, and evolution of metal central sites. The as&#8208;synthesized oxygen doping cooperated with Co&#8208;N&#8208;Fe dual&#8208;sites exhibits high activity and selectivity for SO4&#8226;&#8722; generation during PMS activation. Building upon these findings, a separation catalysis membrane loading OCN&#8208;Co/Fe catalysts within microreactors is constructed, which displays exceptional permeability and durability.








Abstract
Atom&#8208;site catalysts, especially for graphitic carbon nitride&#8208;based catalysts, represents one of the most promising candidates in catalysis membrane for water decontamination. However, unravelling the intricate relationships between synthesis&#8208;structure&#8211;properties remains a great challenge. This study addresses the impacts of coordination environment and structure units of metal central sites based on Mantel test, correlation analysis, and evolution of metal central sites. An optimized unconventional oxygen doping cooperated with Co&#8208;N&#8208;Fe dual&#8208;sites (OCN Co/Fe) exhibits synergistic mechanism for efficient peroxymonosulfate activation, which benefits from a significant increase in charge density at the active sites and the regulation in the natural population of orbitals, leading to selective generation of SO4&#8226;&#8722;. Building upon these findings, the OCN&#8208;Co/Fe/PVDF composite membrane demonstrates a 33&#160;min&#8722;1 ciprofloxacin (CIP) rejection efficiency and maintains over 96% CIP removal efficiency (over 24&#160;h) with an average permeance of 130.95&#160;L&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1. This work offers a fundamental guide for elucidating the definitive origin of catalytic performance in advance oxidation process to facilitate the rational design of separation catalysis membrane with improved performance and enhanced stability.

         <title>Deep&#8208;Blue and Fast Delayed Fluorescence from Carbene&#8211;Metal&#8211;Amides for Highly Efficient and Stable Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bright deep&#8208;blue thermally activated delayed fluorescent emitters, carbene&#8208;gold&#8208;amides (CMA), possess near unity photoluminescent quantum yields and record high radiative rates up to 4.6&#160;&#215;&#160;106&#160;s&#8722;1. Molecular design rules are explained to achieve and predict deep&#8208;blue CMA materials. Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLED) emit deep&#8208;blue electroluminescence with efficiency up to 25.7% with operating stability of 1 h at practical brightness. 








Abstract
Linear gold complexes of the &#8220;carbene&#8211;metal&#8211;amide&#8221; (CMA) type are prepared with a rigid benzoguanidine amide donor and various carbene ligands. These complexes emit in the deep&#8208;blue range at 424 and 466&#160;nm with 100% quantum yields in all media. The deep&#8208;blue thermally activates delayed fluorescence originates from a charge transfer state with an excited state lifetime as low as 213&#160;ns, resulting in fast radiative rates of 4.7&#160;&#215;&#160;106&#160;s&#8722;1. The high thermal and photo&#8208;stability of these carbene&#8211;metal&#8211;amide (CMA) materials enabled the authors to fabricate highly energy&#8208;efficient organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLED) in host&#8211;guest architectures. Deep&#8208;blue OLED devices with electroluminescence at 416 and 457&#160;nm with practical external quantum efficiencies of up to 23% at 100&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 with excellent color coordinates CIE (x; y)&#160;=&#160;0.16; 0.07 and 0.17; 0.18 are reported. The operating stability of these OLEDs is the longest reported to date (LT50&#160;=&#160;1&#160;h) for deep&#8208;blue CMA emitters, indicating a high promise for further development of blue OLED devices. These findings inform the molecular design strategy and correlation between delayed luminescence with high radiative rates and CMA OLED device operating stability.

         <title>Stabilizing the Bulk&#8208;Phase and Solid Electrolyte Interphase of Silicon Microparticle Anode by Constructing Gradient&#8208;Hierarchically Ordered Conductive Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a gradient&#8208;hierarchically ordered conductive (GHOC) network is designed to enhance the stability of both the bulk&#8208;phase and interphase of &#181;Si. Within the GHOC network, Ti3C2T acts as conductive &#8220;brick&#8221;, establishing highly conductive inner layer, while the porous outer layer, composed of TCNF and PAA, functions akin to structural &#8220;rebar&#8221; and &#8220;concrete&#8221;, ensuring the tightly interconnected conductive framework.








Abstract
The poor bulk&#8208;phase and interphase stability, attributable to adverse internal stress, impede the cycling performance of silicon microparticles (&#181;Si) anodes and the commercial application for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries. In this work, a groundbreaking gradient&#8208;hierarchically ordered conductive (GHOC) network structure, ingeniously engineered to enhance the stability of both bulk&#8208;phase and the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) configurations of &#181;Si, is proposed. Within the GHOC network architecture, two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition metal carbides (Ti3C2Tx) act as a conductive &#8220;brick&#8221;, establishing a highly conductive inner layer on &#181;Si, while the porous outer layer, composed of one&#8208;dimensional (1D) Tempo&#8208;oxidized cellulose nanofibers (TCNF) and polyacrylic acid (PAA) macromolecule, functions akin to structural &#8220;rebar&#8221; and &#8220;concrete&#8221;, effectively preserves the tightly interconnected conductive framework through multiple bonding mechanisms, including covalent and hydrogen bonds. Additionally, Ti3C2Tx enhances the development of a LiF&#8208;enriched SEI. Consequently, the &#181;Si&#8208;MTCNF&#8208;PAA anode presents a high discharge capacity of 1413.7 mAh g&#8722;1 even after 500 cycles at 1.0 C. Moreover, a full cell, integrating LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 with &#181;Si&#8208;MTCNF&#8208;PAA, exhibits a capacity retention rate of 92.0% following 50 cycles. This GHOC network structure can offer an efficacious pathway for stabilizing both the bulk&#8208;phase and interphase structure of anode materials with high volumetric strain.

         <title>Black Phosphorus Nanosheets Protect Neurons by Degrading Aggregative &#945;&#8208;syn and Clearing ROS in Parkinson's Disease</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#945;&#8208;syn is an important target in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). The study finds that black phosphorus nanosheets (BPNSs) degrade &#945;&#8208;syn aggregates by directly binding &#945;&#8208;syn and activating autophagy. In addition, BPNSs can also protect mitochondria and clear reactive oxygen species, thereby protecting neuronal cells and treating Parkinson's disease. Further, BPNSs are able to cross the blood&#8211;brain barrier and treat PD model mice in vivo.








Abstract
Although evidence indicates that the abnormal accumulation of &#945;&#8208;synuclein (&#945;&#8208;syn) in dopamine neurons of the substantia nigra is the main pathological feature of Parkinson's disease (PD), no compounds that have both &#945;&#8208;syn antiaggregation and &#945;&#8208;syn degradation functions have been successful in treating the disease in the clinic. Here, it is shown that black phosphorus nanosheets (BPNSs) interact directly with &#945;&#8208;syn fibrils to trigger their disaggregation for PD treatment. Moreover, BPNSs have a specific affinity for &#945;&#8208;syn through van der Waals forces. And BPNSs are found to activate autophagy to maintain &#945;&#8208;syn homeostasis, improve mitochondrial dysfunction, reduce reactive oxygen species levels, and rescue neuronal death and synaptic loss in PC12 cells. It is also observed that BPNSs penetrate the blood&#8211;brain barrier and protect against dopamine neuron loss, alleviating behavioral disorders in 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,2,3,6&#8208;tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) induced mouse model and hA53T &#945;&#8208;syn transgenic mice. Together, the study reveals that BPNSs have the potential as a novel integrated nanomedicine for clinical diagnosis and treatment of neurological diseases.

In addition, BPNSs can also protect mitochondria and clear reactive oxygen species, thereby protecting neuronal cells and treating Parkinson's disease. Further, BPNSs are able to cross the blood&#8211;brain barrier and treat PD model mice in vivo.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although evidence indicates that the abnormal accumulation of &#945;-synuclein (&#945;-syn) in dopamine neurons of the substantia nigra is the main pathological feature of Parkinson's disease (PD), no compounds that have both &#945;-syn antiaggregation and &#945;-syn degradation functions have been successful in treating the disease in the clinic. Here, it is shown that black phosphorus nanosheets (BPNSs) interact directly with &#945;-syn fibrils to trigger their disaggregation for PD treatment. Moreover, BPNSs have a specific affinity for &#945;-syn through van der Waals forces. And BPNSs are found to activate autophagy to maintain &#945;-syn homeostasis, improve mitochondrial dysfunction, reduce reactive oxygen species levels, and rescue neuronal death and synaptic loss in PC12 cells. It is also observed that BPNSs penetrate the blood&#8211;brain barrier and protect against dopamine neuron loss, alleviating behavioral disorders in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) induced mouse model and hA53T &#945;-syn transgenic mice. Together, the study reveals that BPNSs have the potential as a novel integrated nanomedicine for clinical diagnosis and treatment of neurological diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Constructing Two&#8208;Dimensional (2D) Heterostructure Channels with Engineered Biomembrane and Graphene for Precise Scandium Sieving</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unique non&#8208;channel protein, LanM, is successfully modified to the biological membrane by genetic engineering for the first time, integrating it within the interlayer of GO membrane using interaction to construct a LP&#8208;GO heterostructure membrane. Utilizing the difference in binding ability between LanM with rare earth elements (REE), efficiently isolating Sc3+ ions amidst REE (SFCe/Sc&#8776;167), is focused on.








Abstract
The special properties of rare earth elements (REE) have effectively broadened their application fields. How to accurately recognize and efficiently separate target rare earth ions with similar radii and chemical properties remains a formidable challenge. Here, precise two&#8208;dimensional (2D) heterogeneous channels are constructed using engineered E. coli membranes between graphene oxide (GO) layers. The difference in binding ability and corresponding conformational change between Lanmodulin (LanM) and rare earth ions in the heterogeneous channel allows for precisely recognizing and sieving of scandium ions (Sc3+). The engineered E. coli membranes not only can protect the integrity of structure and functionality of LanM, the rich lipids and sugars, but also help the Escherichia coli (E. coli) membranes closely tile on the GO nanosheets through interaction, preventing swelling and controlling interlayer spacing accurately down to the sub&#8208;nanometer. Apparently, the 2D heterogeneous channels showcase excellent selectivity for trivalent ions (SFFe/Sc&#8776;3), especially for Sc3+ ions in REE with high selectivity (SFCe/Sc&#8776;167, SFLa/Sc&#8776;103). The long&#8208;term stability and tensile strain tests verify the membrane's outstanding stability. Thus, this simple, efficient, and cost&#8208;effective work provides a suggestion for constructing 2D interlayer heterogeneous channels for precise sieving, and this valuable strategy is proposed for the efficient extraction of Sc.

         <title>General Fabrication of Robust Alloyed Metal Anodes for High&#8208;Performance Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes a general, straightforward, yet highly effective method for fabricating alloyed metal anodes, which are achieved by electromagnetic&#160;induction heating of anode metals, substrate metals, and alloying metals. The novel approach aims to address persistent dendrite formation, limited cyclicity, and suboptimal energy density associated with metal anodes in practical rechargeable metal batteries.








Abstract
Revitalizing metal anodes for rechargeable batteries confronts challenges such as dendrite formation, limited cyclicity, and suboptimal energy density. Despite various efforts, a practical fabrication method for dendrite&#8208;free metal anodes remains unavailable. Herein, focusing on Li as exemplar, a general strategy is reported to enhance reversibility of the metal anodes by forming alloyed metals, which is achieved by induction heating of 3D substrate, lithiophilic metals, and Li within tens of seconds. It is demonstrated that preferred alloying interactions between substrates and lithiophilic metals created a lithiophilic metal&#8208;rich region adjacent to the substrate, serving as ultrastable lithiophilic host to guide dendrite&#8208;free deposition, particularly during prolonged high&#8208;capacity cycling. Simultaneously, an alloying between lithiophilic metals and Li creates a Li&#8208;rich region adjacent to electrolyte that reduces nucleation overpotential and constitutes favorable electrolyte&#8208;Li interface. The resultant composite Li anodes paired with high areal loading LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathodes achieve superior cycling stability and remarkable energy density above 1200 Wh L&#8722;1 (excluding packaging). Furthermore, this approach shows broader applicability to other metal anodes plagued by dendrite&#8208;related challenges, such as Na and Zn. Overall, this work paves the way for development of commercially viable metal&#8208;based batteries that offer a combination of safety, high energy density, and durability.

         <title>Constructing High&#8208;Active Surface of Plasmonic Tungsten Oxide for Photocatalytic Alcohol Dehydration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high&#8208;active surface of plasmonic tungsten oxide is tuned by simultaneously increasing the body crystallinity and surface oxygen vacancies to overcome the hindrance of the surface depletion layer in photocatalytic alcohol dehydration. The activation barrier for TBA dehydration is significantly reduced by 93% to 6.0&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1, and highly selective isobutylene generation reaches 1.8&#160;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1.








Abstract
Plasmonic semiconductors with broad spectral response hold significant promise for sustainable solar energy utilization. However, the surface inertness limits the photocatalytic activity. Herein, a novel approach is proposed to improve the body crystallinity and increase the surface oxygen vacancies of plasmonic tungsten oxide by the combination of hydrochloric acid (HCl) regulation and light irradiation, which can promote the adsorption of tert&#8208;butyl alcohol (TBA) on plasmonic tungsten oxide and overcome the hindrance of the surface depletion layer in photocatalytic alcohol dehydration. Additionally, this process can concentrate electrons for strong plasmonic electron oscillation on the near surface, facilitating rapid electron transfer within the adsorbed TBA molecules for C&#8208;O bond cleavage. As a result, the activation barrier for TBA dehydration is significantly reduced by 93% to 6.0&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1, much lower than that of thermocatalysis (91&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1). Therefore, an optimal isobutylene generation rate of 1.8&#160;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 (selectivity of 99.9%) is achieved. A small flow reaction system is further constructed, which shows an isobutylene generation rate of 12&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 under natural sunlight irradiation. This work highlights the potential of plasmonic semiconductors for efficient photocatalytic alcohol dehydration, thereby promoting the sustainable utilization of solar energy.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction on Metallic CoNi&#8208;Terminated Catalyst with Industrial&#8208;Level Current Density in Neutral Medium</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An industrial&#8208;level current density is achieved in neutral medium under very low overpotential on a metallic CoNi&#8208;terminated catalyst via electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (eNO3RR). The complete conversion process for high&#8208;purity ammonium nitrate products displays a sustainable and promising process toward directly converting nitrate&#8208;containing pollutant solutions into practical nitrogen fertilizers.








Abstract
Green ammonia synthesis through electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (eNO3RR) can serve as an effective alternative to the traditional energy&#8208;intensive Haber&#8208;Bosch process. However, achieving high Faradaic efficiency (FE) at industrially relevant current density in neutral medium poses significant challenges in eNO3RR. Herein, with the guidance of theoretical calculation, a metallic CoNi&#8208;terminated catalyst is successfully designed and constructed on copper foam, which achieves an ammonia FE of up to 100% under industrial&#8208;level current density and very low overpotential (&#8722;0.15&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode) in a neutral medium. Multiple characterization results have confirmed that the maintained metal atom&#8208;terminated surface through interaction with copper atoms plays a crucial role in reducing overpotential and achieving high current density. By constructing a homemade gas stripping and absorption device, the complete conversion process for high&#8208;purity ammonium nitrate products is demonstrated, displaying the potential for practical application. This work suggests a sustainable and promising process toward directly converting nitrate&#8208;containing pollutant solutions into practical nitrogen fertilizers.

         <title>Inorganic Composition Modulation of Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Fast Charging Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>

Lithium fluoride (LiF) can effectively improve the stability of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). However, the low Li ion conductivity of LiF impedes the rapid diffusion of Li ions in the SEI. To address this issue, a fluorophosphated SEI with fast ion&#8208;diffusing inorganic grain boundaries (LiF/Li3P) is introduced, which enable Li metal batteries to exhibit excellent fast&#8208;charging&#160;performance.








Abstract
The solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) with lithium fluoride (LiF) is critical to the performance of lithium metal batteries (LMBs) due to its high stability and mechanical properties. However, the low Li ion conductivity of LiF impedes the rapid diffusion of Li ions in the SEI, which leads to localized Li ion oversaturation dendritic deposition and hinders the practical applications of LMBs at high&#8208;current regions (&gt;3 C). To address this issue, a fluorophosphated SEI rich with fast ion&#8208;diffusing inorganic grain boundaries (LiF/Li3P) is introduced. By utilizing a sol electrolyte that contains highly dispersed porous LiF nanoparticles modified with phosphorus&#8208;containing functional groups, a fluorophosphated SEI is constructed and the presence of electrochemically active Li within these fast ion&#8208;diffusing grain boundaries (GBs&#8208;Li) that are non&#8208;nucleated is demonstrated, ensuring the stability of the Li || NCM811 cell for over 1000 cycles at fast&#8208;charging rates of 5 C (11&#160;mA cm&#8722;2). Additionally, a practical, long cycling, and intrinsically safe LMB pouch cell with high energy density (400&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1) is fabricated. The work reveals how SEI components and structure design can enable fast&#8208;charging LMBs.

A novel fluoropolymer PF7 is designed by branched fluorination in side chains. Due to fluorine&#8208;induced interactions, PF7 comprehensively outperforms the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polymer PM6 in photovoltaic properties. By combining with fluorous solvent vapor annealing, the device achieves a remarkable efficiency of 19.09%. The synergy of fluoropolymer and fluorous solvent exhibits an excellent universality.








Abstract
Rational molecular design and suitable device engineering are two important strategies to boost the efficiencies in organic solar cells (OSCs). Yet these two approaches are independently developed, while their synergy is believed to be more productive. Herein, a branched polyfluoride moiety, heptafluoroisopropoxyl group, is introduced into the side chains of conjugated polymers for the first time. Compared with the conventional alkyl chain, this polyfluoride chain can endow the resulting polymer namely PF7 with highly packing order and strong crystallinity owing to the strong polarization and fluorine&#8208;induced interactions, while good solubility and moderate miscibility are retained. As a result, PF7 comprehensively outperforms the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polymer PM6 in photovoltaic properties. More importantly, based on the solubility of heptafluoroisopropoxyl groups in fluorous solvents, a new post&#8208;treatment denoted as fluorous solvent vapor annealing (FSVA) is proposed to match PF7. Differing from the existing post&#8208;treatments, FSVA can selectively reorganize fluoropolymer molecules but less impact small molecules in blend films. By employing the synergy of fluoropolymer and fluorous solvent, the device achieves a remarkable efficiency of 19.09%, which is among the best efficiencies in binary OSCs. The polymer PF7 and the FSVA treatment exhibit excellent universality in various OSCs with different material combinations or device architectures.

         <title>Active Passivation of Anion Vacancies in Antimony Selenide Film for Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
VSe is a kind of detrimental deep&#8208;level defect in Sb2Se3 thin films which induces serious carrier trapping. The effective passivation of defects is achieved by introducing trace amount of sulfur into Sb2Se3 film by transforming VSe to SSe. SSe defects are benign and do not trap charge carriers, thus improving the carrier lifetime and device performance.








Abstract
Binary antimony selenide (Sb2Se3) is a promising inorganic light&#8208;harvesting material with high stability, nontoxicity, and wide light harvesting capability. In this photovoltaic material, it has been recognized that deep energy level defects with large carrier capture cross section, such as VSe (selenium vacancy), lead to serious open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) deficit and in turn limit the achievable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of Sb2Se3 solar cells. Understanding the nature of deep&#8208;level defects and establishing effective method to eliminate the defects are vital to improving VOC. In this study, a novel directed defect passivation strategy is proposed to suppress the formation of VSe and maintain the composition and morphology of Sb2Se3 film. In particular, through systematic study on the evolution of defect properties, the pathway of defect passivation reaction is revealed. Owing to the inhibition of defect&#8208;assisted recombination, the VOC increases, resulting in an improvement of PCE from 7.69% to 8.90%, which is the highest efficiency of Sb2Se3 solar cells prepared by thermal evaporation method with superstrate device configuration. This study proposes a new understanding of the nature of deep&#8208;level defects and enlightens the fabrication of high quality Sb2Se3 thin film for solar cell applications.

         <title>Hydroxyl&#8208;Bonded Co Single Atom Site on Boroncarbonitride Surface Realizes Nonsacrificial H2O2 Synthesis in the Near&#8208;Infrared Region</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through constructing the hydroxyl&#8208;bonded Co single&#8208;atom on boroncarbonitride surface as the site of the one&#8208;step two&#8208;electron reduction of O2, the H2O2 evolution with an apparent quantum efficiency of 0.8% at 850&#160;nm is achieved. The hydroxyl&#8208;bonded Co single&#8208;atom can avoid the formation of &#8226;O2&#8722; and reduce the breakage of O&#9472;O bond, reducing the energy barrier of H2O2 generation.








Abstract
Photocatalytic synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from O2 and H2O under near&#8208;infrared light is a sustainable renewable energy production strategy, but challenging reaction. The bottleneck of this reaction lies in the regulation of O2 reduction path by photocatalyst. Herein, the center of the one&#8208;step two&#8208;electron reduction (OSR) pathway of O2 for H2O2 evolution via the formation of the hydroxyl&#8208;bonded Co single&#8208;atom sites on boroncarbonitride surface (BCN&#8208;OH2/Co1) is constructed. The experimental and theoretical prediction results confirm that the hydroxyl group on the surface and the electronic band structure of BCN&#8208;OH2/Co1 are the key factor in regulating the O2 reduction pathway. In addition, the hydroxyl&#8208;bonded Co single&#8208;atom sites can further enrich O2 molecules with more electrons, which can avoid the one&#8208;electron reduction of O2 to &#8226;O2&#8722;, thus promoting the direct two&#8208;electron activation hydrogenation of O2. Consequently, BCN&#8208;OH2/Co1 exhibits a high H2O2 evolution apparent quantum efficiency of 0.8% at 850&#160;nm, better than most of the previously reported photocatalysts. This study reveals an important reaction pathway for the generation of H2O2, emphasizing that precise control of the active site structure of the photocatalyst is essential for achieving efficient conversion of solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical.

Consequently, BCN-OH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Co&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits a high H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution apparent quantum efficiency of 0.8% at 850&#160;nm, better than most of the previously reported photocatalysts. This study reveals an important reaction pathway for the generation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, emphasizing that precise control of the active site structure of the photocatalyst is essential for achieving efficient conversion of solar-to-chemical.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Edible Long&#8208;Afterglow Photoluminescent Materials for Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal strategy is proposed to construct edible photoluminescent long&#8208;afterglow materials by embedding luminophore multicarboxylates into a series of inorganic salt lattices. Particularly, edible afterglow barium meal formed by coronene salt doped BaSO4 can be applied into gastrointestinal afterglow imaging captured by instruments or mobile phone.








Abstract
Confining luminophores into modified hydrophilic matrices or polymers is a straightforward and widely used approach for afterglow bioimaging. However, the afterglow quantum yield and lifetime of the related material remain unsatisfactory, severely limiting the using effect especially for deep&#8208;tissue time&#8208;resolved imaging. This fact largely stems from the dilemma between material biocompatibility and the quenching effect of water environment. Herein an in situ metathesis promoted doping strategy is presented, namely, mixing &#8776;10&#8722;3 weight ratio of organic&#8208;emitter multicarboxylates with inorganic salt reactants, followed by metathesis reactions to prepare a series of hydrophilic but water&#8208;insoluble organic&#8211;inorganic doping afterglow materials. This strategy leads to the formation of edible long&#8208;afterglow photoluminescent materials with superior biocompatibility and excellent bioimaging effect. The phosphorescence quantum yield of the materials can reach dozens of percent (the highest case: 66.24%), together with the photoluminescent lifetime lasting for coupes of seconds. Specifically, a long&#8208;afterglow barium meal formed by coronene salt emitter and BaSO4 matrix is applied into animal experiments by gavage, and bright stomach afterglow imaging is observed by instruments or mobile phone after ceasing the photoexcitation with deep tissue penetration. This strategy allows a flexible dosage of the materials during bioimaging, facilitating the development of real&#8208;time probing and theranostic technology.

         <title>A Customized Biohybrid Presenting Cascade Responses to Tumor Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;pathogenic DH5&#945; Escherichia coli is endowed with heterologous and extended lactate metabolism through dual biological and material engineering to precisely target and disturb the tumor microenvironment. The dual&#8208;engineered microbe, PP3244@Fe&#8208;ZT, exhibits remarkable abilities to consume lactate and induce ferroptosis. This platform offers a novel avenue for therapeutic biohybrid design by constructing specific metabolic pathways through biological and material methods.








Abstract
Intrinsic characteristics of microorganisms, including non&#8208;specific metabolism sites, toxic byproducts, and uncontrolled proliferation constrain their exploitation in medical applications such as tumor therapy. Here, the authors report an engineered biohybrid that can efficiently target cancerous sites through a pre&#8208;determined metabolic pathway to enable precise tumor ablation. In this system, DH5&#945; Escherichia coli is engineered by the introduction of hypoxia&#8208;inducible promoters and lactate oxidase genes, and further surface&#8208;armored with iron&#8208;doped ZIF&#8208;8 nanoparticles. This bioengineered E. coli can produce and secrete lactate oxidase to reduce lactate concentration in response to hypoxic tumor microenvironment, as well as triggering immune activation. The peroxidase&#8208;like functionality of the nanoparticles extends the end product of the lactate metabolism, enabling the conversion of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) into highly cytotoxic hydroxyl radicals. This, coupled with the transformation of tirapazamine loaded on nanoparticles to toxic benzotriazinyl, culminates in severe tumor cell ferroptosis. Intravenous injection of this biohybrid significantly inhibits tumor growth and metastasis.

         <title>A Hemoglobin Bionics&#8208;Based System for Combating Antibiotic Resistance in Chronic Diabetic Wounds via Iron Homeostasis Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hemoglobin bionics&#8208;based glucose/pH&#8208;responsive microneedle bandage, PDGa@GMB, is used for combating antibiotic resistance in chronic diabetic wounds. PDGa@GMB shows insusceptibility to genetic resistance with sustainable antimicrobial effects against both S. aureus and E. coli (&gt;95%) and accelerates tissue recovery (&lt;20 d). It holds tremendous potential for mediating microbial&#8208;host crosstalk, thereby synergistically attenuating pathogen virulence and pathogenicity.








Abstract
Owing to the increased tissue iron accumulation in patients with diabetes, microorganisms may activate high expression of iron&#8208;involved metabolic pathways, leading to the exacerbation of bacterial infections and disruption of systemic glucose metabolism. Therefore, an on&#8208;demand transdermal dosing approach that utilizes iron homeostasis regulation to combat antimicrobial resistance is a promising strategy to address the challenges associated with low administration bioavailability and high antibiotic resistance in treating infected diabetic wounds. Here, it is aimed to propose an effective therapy based on hemoglobin bionics to induce disturbances in bacterial iron homeostasis. The preferred &#8220;iron cargo&#8221; is synthesized by protoporphyrin IX chelated with dopamine and gallium (PDGa), and is delivered via a glucose/pH&#8208;responsive microneedle bandage (PDGa@GMB). The PDGa@GMB downregulates the expression levels of the iron uptake regulator (Fur) and the peroxide response regulator (perR) in Staphylococcus aureus, leading to iron nutrient starvation and oxidative stress, ultimately suppressing iron&#8208;dependent bacterial activities. Consequently, PDGa@GMB demonstrates insusceptibility to genetic resistance while maintaining sustainable antimicrobial effects (&gt;90%) against resistant strains of both S. aureus and E. coli, and accelerates tissue recovery (&lt;20 d). Overall, PDGa@GMB not only counteracts antibiotic resistance but also holds tremendous potential in mediating microbial&#8208;host crosstalk, synergistically attenuating pathogen virulence and pathogenicity.

         <title>Shape&#8208;Versatile Fixed Cellular Materials for Multiple Target Immunomodulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aggregates of cells undergo a fixation procedure to ensure devitalization and long&#8208;lasting maintenance of architectonic features, both for spheroids and fibers. Direct contact of fixed cellular materials with cells from the innate and adaptive branches of the immune system shows their immunomodulatory properties. In an in vivo wound model distinct immunomodulatory profiles are dependent on the administered dose.








Abstract
Therapeutic cells are usually administered as living agents, despite the risks of undesired cell migration and acquisition of unpredictable phenotypes. Additionally, most cell&#8208;based therapies rely on the administration of single cells, often associated with rapid in vivo clearance. 3D cellular materials may be useful to prolong the effect of cellular therapies and offer the possibility of creating structural volumetric constructs. Here, the manufacturing of shape&#8208;versatile fixed cell&#8208;based materials with immunomodulatory properties is reported. Living cell aggregates with different shapes (spheres and centimeter&#8208;long fibers) are fixed using a method compatible with maintenance of structural integrity, robustness, and flexibility of 3D constructs.&#160;The biological properties of living cells can be modulated before fixation, rendering&#160;an in vitro&#160;anti&#8208;inflammatory effect toward human macrophages, in line with a decreased activation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF&#8208;&#954;B) pathway that preponderantly correlated with the surface area of the materials. These findings are further corroborated in vivo in mouse skin wounds. Contact with fixed materials also reduces the proliferation of&#160;activated primary T lymphocytes, while promoting&#160;regulatory populations. The fixation of cellular constructs is proposed as a versatile phenotypic stabilization method that can be easily implemented to prepare immunomodulatory materials with therapeutic potential.

         <title>Directional Formation of Reactive Oxygen Species Via a Non&#8208;Redox Catalysis Strategy That Bypasses Electron Transfer Process</title>

Dual active centers (Fe/B) motivate the directional conversion of PMS into valuable 1O2 solely dependent on the inherent structural properties of catalyst, bypassing the need of conventional electron transfer between the two, which effectively alleviates the unevitable redox cycling limitations of catalyst.








Abstract
A broad range of chemical transformations driven by catalytic processes necessitates the electron transfer between catalyst and substrate. The redox cycle limitation arising from the inequivalent electron donation and acceptance of the involved catalysts, however, generally leads to their deactivation, causing substantial economic losses and environmental risks. Here, a &#8220;non&#8208;redox catalysis&#8221; strategy is provided, wherein the catalytic units are constructed by atomic Fe and B as dual active sites to create tensile force and electric field, which allows directional self&#8208;decomposition of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) molecules through internal electron transfer to form singlet oxygen, bypassing the need of electron transfer between catalyst and PMS. The proposed catalytic approach with non&#8208;redox cycling of catalyst contributes to excellent stability of the active centers while the generated reactive oxygen species find high efficiency in long&#8208;term catalytic pollutant degradation and selective organic oxidation synthesis in aqueous phase. This work offers a new avenue for directional substrate conversion, which holds promise to advance the design of alternative catalytic pathways for sustainable energy conversion and valuable chemical production.

         <title>Multimodal Tetrahedral DNA Nanoplatform for Surprisingly Rapid and Significant Treatment of Acute Liver Failure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multimodal tetrahedral DNA nanoplatform incorporating tumor necrosis factor&#8208;&#945; siRNA and manganese porphyrin not only promotes the polarization of macrophages to the anti&#8208;inflammatory M2 phenotype but also protects hepatic cells from oxidative stress and promotes cell proliferation by regulating cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase, which exhibits surprisingly rapid and significant targeting therapeutic efficacy for acute liver failure within 2 h.








Abstract
Acute liver failure (ALF) is a life&#8208;threatening disease associated with the rapid development of inflammatory storms, level elevation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and hepatocyte necrosis, which results in high short&#8208;term mortality. Except for liver transplantation, no effective strategies are available for ALF therapy due to the rapid disease progression and narrow window of therapeutic time. Therefore, there is an urgent demand to explore the fast and effective modalities for ALF treatment. Herein, a multifunctional tetrahedral DNA nanoplatform (TDN) is constructed by incorporating tumor necrosis factor&#8208;&#945; siRNA (siTNF&#8208;&#945;) through DNA hybridization and antioxidant manganese porphyrin (MnP4) via &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interaction with G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) for surprisingly rapid and significant ALF therapy. TDN&#8208;siTNF&#8208;&#945;/&#8208;G4&#8208;MnP4 silences TNF&#8208;&#945; of macrophages by siTNF&#8208;&#945; and polarizes them to the anti&#8208;inflammatory M2 phenotype, providing appropriate microenvironments for hepatocyte viability. Additionally, TDN&#8208;siTNF&#8208;&#945;/&#8208;G4&#8208;MnP4 scavenges intracellular ROS by MnP4, protecting hepatocytes from oxidative&#8208;stress&#8208;associated cell death. Furthermore, TDN itself promotes hepatocyte proliferation by modulating the cell cycle. TDN&#8208;siTNF&#8208;&#945;/&#8208;G4&#8208;MnP4 shows almost complete liver accumulation after intravenous injection and exhibits excellent therapeutic efficacy of ALF within 2&#160;h. The multifunctional DNA nanoformulation provides an effective strategy for rapid ALF therapy, expanding its application for innovative treatments of liver diseases.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper presents the epitaxial growth of 8&#8208;in. wafer&#8208;scale highly oriented monolayer MoS2 on sapphire with excellent spatial homogeneity, using a specially designed vertical chemical vapor deposition system. The as&#8208;grown 8&#8208;in. MoS2 wafers are used for the batch fabrication of large&#8208;scale, high&#8208;performance devices, including field&#8208;effect transistors, logic circuits, and ring oscillators, showcasing the potential for practical industry&#8208;scale applications.








Abstract
Large&#8208;scale, high&#8208;quality, and uniform monolayer molybdenum disulfide&#160;(MoS2) films are crucial for their applications in next&#8208;generation electronics and optoelectronics. Epitaxy is a mainstream technique for achieving high&#8208;quality MoS2 films and is demonstrated at a wafer scale up to 4&#8208;in. In this study, the epitaxial growth of 8&#8208;in. wafer&#8208;scale highly oriented monolayer MoS2 on sapphire is reported as with excellent spatial homogeneity, using a specially designed vertical chemical vapor deposition (VCVD) system. Field effect transistors (FETs) based on the as&#8208;grown 8&#8208;in. wafer&#8208;scale monolayer MoS2 film are fabricated and exhibit high performances, with an average mobility and an on/off ratio of 53.5 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and 107, respectively. In addition, batch fabrication of logic devices and 11&#8208;stage ring oscillators are also demonstrated, showcasing excellent electrical functions. This work may pave the way of MoS2 in practical industry&#8208;scale applications.

         <title>The Unprecedented Biodegradable Polyzwitterion: A Removal&#8208;Free Patch for Accelerating Infected Diabetic Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A removal&#8208;free and self&#8208;immolative polyzwitterion patch prepared by ring&#8208;opening polymerization of dithiolane&#8208;based zwitterion can be used as a wound dressing to accelerate infected diabetic wound repair due to its ability to inhibit the bacterial adhesion, kill bacteria, and scavenge excessive reactive oxygen species at the wound site to regulate the local microenvironment, including regulation of cytokine expression, and macrophage polarization.








Abstract
Zwitterionic polymers have emerged as an important class of biomaterials to construct wound dressings and antifouling coatings over the past decade due to their excellent hydrophilicity. However, all the reported zwitterionic polymers as wound dressings are nondegradable because of noncleavable carbon&#9472;carbon bonding backbones, and must be removed periodically after treatment to avoid hypoxia in the wound, thus leading to potential secondary injury. In this work, a biodegradable polyzwitterion patch is fabricated for the first time by ring&#8208;opening polymerization of carboxybetaine dithiolane (CBDS), which is self&#8208;crosslinked via inter&#8208;amide hydrogen bonds and zwitterionic dipole&#8211;dipole interactions on the side chains. The unprecedented polyCBDS (PCBDS) patch demonstrates enough ductility owing to the intermolecular physical interactions to fully cover irregular wounds, also showing excellent biodegradability and antifouling performance resulted from the existence of disulfide bonds and carboxybetaine groups. Besides, the PCBDS degradation&#8208;induced released CBDS owns potent antioxidant and antibacterial activities. This PCBDS patch is used as a diabetic wound dressing, inhibiting bacterial adhesion on the external surface, and its degradation products can exactly kill bacteria and scavenge excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) at the wound site to regulate local microenvironment, including regulation of cytokine express and macrophage polarization, accelerating infected diabetic wound repair, and also avoiding the potential secondary injury.

         <title>Multiscale Heterogeneous Polymer Composites for High Stiffness 4D Printed Electrically Controllable Multifunctional Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrically controlled stiff morphing structures are built by 4D printing new multiscale polymer composites. Enabling the fabrication of active 3D autonomous structures, capable of self&#8208;sensing actuation, unprecedented levels of actuation stress, and specific mass while undergoing shape change. Integrating these materials with lattice designs enables large scale complex 3D surfaces that are loadbearing, culminating in a crawling multigait robotic lattice.








Abstract
4D printing is an emerging field where 3D printing techniques are used to pattern stimuli&#8208;responsive materials to create morphing structures, with time serving as the fourth dimension. However, current materials utilized for 4D printing are typically soft, exhibiting an elastic modulus (E) range of 10&#8722;4 to 10&#160;MPa during shape change. This restricts the scalability, actuation stress, and load&#8208;bearing capabilities of the resulting structures. To overcome these limitations, multiscale heterogeneous polymer composites are introduced as a novel category of stiff, thermally responsive 4D printed materials. These inks exhibit an E that is four orders of magnitude greater than that of existing 4D printed materials and offer tunable electrical conductivities for simultaneous Joule heating actuation and self&#8208;sensing capabilities. Utilizing electrically controllable bilayers as building blocks, a flat geometry is designed and printed that morphs into a 3D self&#8208;standing lifting robot, setting new records for weight&#8208;normalized load lifted and actuation stress when compared to other 3D printed actuators. Furthermore, the ink palette is employed to create and print planar lattice structures that transform into various self&#8208;supporting complex 3D shapes. These contributions are integrated into a 4D printed electrically controlled multigait crawling robotic lattice structure that can carry 144 times its own weight.

Bone Organoids
Bone organoids serve as innovative tools in biomedical research, enhancing our understanding of bone biology and related diseases. Current bone organoid research is still in its infancy. In article number 2309875, Jiacan Su and co&#8208;workers present a novel approach using bone matrix&#8208;inspired hydroxyapatite hybrid bioinks to fabricate large&#8208;scale self&#8208;mineralizing bone organoids via bioprinting. These miniature, self&#8208;organizing structures mimic the complexity of bone tissue.

Nondestructive Single&#8208;Atom&#8208;Thick Crystallographic Scanner
In article number 2400091, Ji&#8208;Yun Moon, Dongmok Whang, Tae&#8208;Hoon Kim, Jae&#8208;Hyun Lee, and co&#8208;workers develop an efficient, accurate, and non&#8208;destructive crystallographic scanning technique for 2D materials by leveraging sticky&#8208;note&#8208;like van der Waals (vdW) assembling&#8208;disassembling. They visualize the detailed grain structure of polycrystalline graphene by assembling it on a single&#8208;atomic&#8208;thick, single&#8208;crystalline graphene filter. The interlayer twist angle&#8208;dependent optical response arising from vdW&#8208;assembled bilayers enables accurate crystallographic scanning. The characterized polycrystalline graphene can be disassembled from the single&#8208;crystalline graphene filter while maintaining its pristine integrity.

This review examines the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) applications for computational chemistry, categorized by the degree of physical information deployed. It discusses the advantages, limitations, and future prospects for each model category toward the ultimate goal of defining the optimal architecture for AI to predict accurate, transferable, and reproducible solutions of the Schr&#246;dinger&#160;equations.








Abstract
Computational chemistry is an indispensable tool for understanding molecules and predicting chemical properties. However, traditional computational methods face significant challenges due to the difficulty of solving the Schr&#246;dinger equations&#160;and the increasing computational cost with the size of the molecular system. In response, there has been a surge of interest in leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques to in silico experiments. Integrating AI and ML into computational chemistry increases the scalability and speed of the exploration of chemical space. However, challenges remain, particularly regarding the reproducibility and transferability of ML models. This review highlights the evolution of ML in learning from, complementing, or replacing traditional computational chemistry for energy and property predictions. Starting from models trained entirely on numerical data, a journey set forth toward the ideal model incorporating or learning the physical laws of quantum mechanics. This paper also reviews existing computational methods and ML models and their intertwining, outlines a roadmap for future research, and identifies areas for improvement and innovation. Ultimately, the goal is to develop AI architectures capable of predicting accurate and transferable solutions to the Schr&#246;dinger equation, thereby revolutionizing in silico experiments within chemistry and materials&#160;science.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Luminescent Materials Incorporating Rare Earth/Transition Metal Ions: From Materials to Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various synthesis techniques on how to subtly incorporate rare earth/transition metals into various matrices in the NIR are reviewed, followed by a discussion of strategies to improve the excitation absorption and emission efficiency of NIR materials. Finally, functionalization strategies and their applications are presented. As such it provides a valuable overview of the field.








Abstract
The spotlight has shifted to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) luminescent materials emitting beyond 1000 nm, with growing interest due to their unique characteristics. The ability of NIR&#8208;II emission (1000&#8211;1700 nm) to penetrate deeply and transmit independently positions these NIR luminescent materials for applications in optical&#8208;communication devices, bioimaging, and photodetectors. The combination of rare earth metals/transition metals with a variety of matrix materials provides a new platform for creating new chemical and physical properties for materials science and device applications. In this review, the recent advancements in NIR emission activated by rare earth and transition metal ions are summarized and their role in applications spanning bioimaging, sensing, and optoelectronics is illustrated. It started with various synthesis techniques and explored how rare earths/transition metals can be skillfully incorporated into various matrixes, thereby endowing them with unique characteristics. The discussion to strategies of enhancing excitation absorption and emission efficiency, spotlighting innovations like dye sensitization and surface plasmon resonance effects is then extended. Subsequently, a significant focus is placed on functionalization strategies and their applications. Finally, a comprehensive analysis of the challenges and proposed strategies for rare earth/transition metal ion&#8208;doped near&#8208;infrared luminescent materials, summarizing the insights of each section is provided.

         <title>2D Hybrid Perovskites: From Static and Dynamic Structures to Potential Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
How static and dynamic lattices define the optoelectronic properties and facilitate potential applications of 2D perovskites is detailed in this review. The static structure, including octahedral distortion and bond variations, dominates the fine band structure. The dynamic structure, such as lattice vibration and carrier&#8211;matter coupling, regulates carrier dynamics. They are jointly responsible for the resulting performance.








Abstract
2D perovskites have received great attention recently due to their structural tunability and environmental stability, making them highly promising candidates for various applications by breaking property bottlenecks that affect established materials. However, in 2D perovskites, the complicated interplay between organic spacers and inorganic slabs makes structural analysis challenging to interpret. A deeper understanding of the structure&#8211;property relationship in these systems is urgently needed to enable high&#8208;performance tunable optoelectronic devices. Herein, this study examines how structural changes, from constant lattice distortion and variable structural evolution, modeled with both static and dynamic structural descriptors, affect macroscopic properties and ultimately device performance. The effect of chemical composition, crystallographic inhomogeneity, and mechanical&#8208;stress&#8208;induced static structural changes and corresponding electronic band variations is reported. In addition, the structure dynamics are described from the viewpoint of anharmonic vibrations, which impact electron&#8211;phonon coupling and the carriers&#8217; dynamic processes. Correlated carrier&#8211;matter interactions, known as polarons and acting on fine electronic structures, are then discussed. Finally, reliable guidelines to facilitate design to exploit structural features and rationally achieve breakthroughs in 2D perovskite applications are proposed. This review provides a global structural landscape of 2D perovskites, expected to promote the prosperity of these materials in emerging device applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Voltage Spinel Cathode Materials: Navigating the Structural Evolution for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although significant progresses have been made in recent years, persistent misconceptions and disputes continue to haunt the investigation of high&#8208;voltage spinel oxides for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. This review aims to unravel the intricacies of their crystallography, phase transitions, and electrochemical behaviors, thereby guiding future research endeavors.








Abstract
High&#8208;voltage LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO) spinel oxides are highly promising cobalt&#8208;free cathode materials to cater to the surging demand for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, commercial application of LNMOs is still challenging despite decades of research. To address the challenge, the understanding of their crystallography and structural evolutions during synthesis and electrochemical operation is critical. This review aims to illustrate and to update the fundamentals of crystallography, phase transition mechanisms, and electrochemical behaviors of LNMOs. First, the research history of LNMO and its development into a LIB cathode material is outlined. Then the structural basics of LNMOs including the classic and updated views of the crystal polymorphism, interconversion between the polymorphs, and structure&#8208;composition relationship is reviewed. Afterward, the phase transition mechanisms of LNMOs that connect structural and electrochemical properties are comprehensively discussed from fundamental thermodynamics to operando dynamics at intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;particle levels. In addition, phase evolutions during overlithiation as well as thermal&#8208;/electrochemical&#8208;driven phase transformations of LNMOs are also discussed. Finally, recommendations are offered for the further development of LNMOs as well as other complex materials to unlock their full potential for future sustainable and powerful batteries.

         <title>Fluorinated Organic Polymers for Cancer Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 30, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review article focuses on introducing the applications of fluorinated polymers in tumor drug therapy, elucidating their molecular structures, synthetic pathways and functional properties, while discussing the challenges currently faced in this field and potential future directions.








Abstract
In the realm of cancer therapy, the spotlight is on nanoscale pharmaceutical delivery systems, especially polymer&#8208;based nanoparticles, for their enhanced drug dissolution, extended presence in the bloodstream, and precision targeting achieved via surface engineering. Leveraging the amplified permeation and retention phenomenon, these systems concentrate therapeutic agents within tumor tissues. Nonetheless, the hurdles of systemic toxicity, biological barriers, and compatibility with living systems persist. Fluorinated polymers, distinguished by their chemical idiosyncrasies, are poised for extensive biomedical applications, notably in stabilizing drug metabolism, augmenting lipophilicity, and optimizing bioavailability. Material science heralds the advent of fluorinated polymers that, by integrating fluorine atoms, unveil a suite of drug delivery merits: the hydrophobic traits of fluorinated alkyl chains ward off lipid or protein disruption, the carbon&#8211;fluorine bond's stability extends the drug's lifecycle in the system, and a lower alkalinity coupled with a diminished ionic charge bolsters the drug's ability to traverse cellular membranes. This comprehensive review delves into the utilization of fluorinated polymers for oncological pharmacotherapy, elucidating their molecular architecture, synthetic pathways, and functional attributes, alongside an exploration of their empirical strengths and the quandaries they encounter in both experimental and clinical settings.

         <title>Large Orientation Angle Buried Substrate Enables Efficient Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective asymmetric &#960;&#8208;extended self&#8208;assembled monolayer (A&#8208;4PADCB) is designed and synthesized, demonstrating favorable coverage on ITO and optimized interface contact with perovskite. When applied A&#8208;4PADCB as buried substrate, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 25.05% for flexible perovskite solar cells and 20.64% (certified 19.51%) for flexible perovskite solar modules are obtained, which are the highest PCEs in the reported literature.








Abstract
Flexible perovskite solar cells (f&#8208;PSCs) have emerged as potential candidates for specific mechanical applications owing to their high foldability, efficiency, and portability. However, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of f&#8208;PSC remains limited by the inferior contact between perovskite and flexible buried substrate. Here, an asymmetric &#960;&#8208;extended self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) (4&#8208;(9H&#8208;dibenzo[a,c]carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)butyl)phosphonic acid (A&#8208;4PADCB) is reported as a buried substrate for efficient inverted f&#8208;PSCs. Employing this design strategy, A&#8208;4PADCB exhibits a significant orientation angle away from the surface normal, homogenizing the distribution of contact potentials. This enhancement improves the SAM/perovskite interface quality, controlling the growth of favorable perovskite films with low defect density and slight tensile stress. Integration of A&#8208;4PADCB into small&#8208;area f&#8208;PSCs and large&#8208;area flexible perovskite solar modules with an aperture area of 20.84&#160;cm2 achieves impressive PCEs of up to 25.05% and 20.64% (certified 19.51%), respectively. Moreover, these optimized A&#8208;4PADCB&#8208;based f&#8208;PSCs possess enhanced light, thermal, and mechanical stability. This research paves a promising avenue toward the design of SAM&#8208;buried substrates with a large orientation angle, regulating perovskite growth, and promoting the commercialization of large&#8208;area flexible perovskite photovoltaics.

This review comprehensively examines the latest advancements in carbon&#8208;based metal&#8208;free catalysts for applications in energy, chemical conversions, and environmental remediation. It highlights the related carbon materials, innovative design strategies, and theoretical studies, along with current challenges and forward&#8208;looking perspectives on the future directions of this rapidly evolving research field.








Abstract
Over the last decade, carbon&#8208;based metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts (C&#8208;MFECs) have become important in electrocatalysis. This field is started thanks to the initial discovery that nitrogen atom doped carbon can function as a metal&#8208;free electrode in alkaline fuel cells. A wide variety of metal&#8208;free carbon nanomaterials, including 0D carbon dots, 1D carbon nanotubes, 2D graphene, and 3D porous carbons, has demonstrated high electrocatalytic performance across a variety of applications. These include clean energy generation and storage, green chemistry, and environmental remediation. The wide applicability of C&#8208;MFECs is facilitated by effective synthetic approaches, e.g., heteroatom doping, and physical/chemical modification. These methods enable the creation of catalysts with electrocatalytic properties useful for sustainable energy transformation and storage (e.g., fuel cells, Zn&#8208;air batteries, Li&#8208;O2 batteries, dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells), green chemical production (e.g., H2O2, NH3, and urea), and environmental remediation (e.g., wastewater treatment, and CO2 conversion). Furthermore, significant advances in the theoretical study of C&#8208;MFECs via advanced computational modeling and machine learning techniques have been achieved, revealing the charge transfer mechanism for rational design and development of highly efficient catalysts. This review offers a timely overview of recent progress in the development of C&#8208;MFECs, addressing material syntheses, theoretical advances, potential applications, challenges and future directions.

         <title>Automated Synthesis of DNA Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this contribution, the first automated, solid&#8208;phase synthesis of DNA nanomaterials is presented, achieved via the prototype DNA nanoassembler system. This methodology enables the production of sequence&#8208;controlled custom DNA nanotubes through self&#8208;assembly. Combining single&#8208;molecule kinetics and photobleaching experiments, microfluidic assembly, and automated data screening, the construction strategy relies on the sequential hybridization of DNA modules at room temperature onto a solid support.








Abstract
DNA nanotechnology has revolutionized the ability to position matter at the nanoscale, but the preparation of DNA&#8208;based architectures remains laborious. To facilitate the formation of custom structures, a fully automated method is reported to produce sequence&#8208; and size&#8208;defined DNA nanotubes. By programming the sequential addition of desired building blocks, rigid DX&#8208;tile&#8208;based DNA nanotubes and flexible wireframe DNA structures are attained, where the total number of possible constructs increases as a power function of the number of different units available. Using single&#8208;molecule fluorescence imaging, the kinetics and yield of each synthetic step can be quantitatively determined, revealing differences in self&#8208;assembly dynamics as the nanotube is built up from the solid support and providing new insights into DNA self&#8208;assembly. The exploitation of automation for both assembly and analysis (through an ad&#8208;hoc developed K&#8208;means clustering algorithm) facilitates a workflow wherein the synthesis parameters may be iteratively improved upon, demonstrating how a single&#8208;molecule &#8220;assembly&#8208;analysis&#8208;optimization&#8221; sequence can be used to generate complex, noncovalent materials in good yield. The presented synthetic strategy is generalizable, making use of equipment already available in most standard laboratories and represents the first fully automated supramolecular assembly on a solid support.

         <title>Extremely Large Anomalous Hall Conductivity and Unusual Axial Diamagnetism in a Quasi&#8208;1D Dirac Material La3MgBi5</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anomalous Hall effect is observed in quasi&#8208;1D Dirac Material La3MgBi5. The obtained anomalous Hall conductivity is the largest one in the current anomalous Hall effect systems. Especially, the absence of magnetic elements makes La3MgBi5 one of the few non&#8208;magnetic materials that can exhibit anomalous Hall effect.








Abstract
Anomalous Hall effect (AHE), one of the most important electronic transport phenomena, generally appears in ferromagnetic materials but is rare in materials without magnetic elements. Here, a study of La3MgBi5 is presented, whose band structure carries multitype Dirac fermions. Although magnetic elements are absent in La3MgBi5, the signals of AHE can be observed. In particular, the anomalous Hall conductivity is extremely large, reaching 42,356 &#937;&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1 with an anomalous Hall angle of 8.8%, the largest one that has been observed in the current AHE systems. The AHE is suggested to originate from the combination of skew scattering and Berry curvature. Another unique property discovered in La3MgBi5 is the axial diamagnetism. The diamagnetism is significantly enhanced and dominates the magnetization in the axial directions, which is the result of the restricted motion of the Dirac fermion at the Fermi level. These findings not only establish La3MgBi5 as a suitable platform to study AHE and quantum transport but also indicate the great potential of 315&#8208;type Bi&#8208;based materials for exploring novel physical&#160;properties.

         <title>Towards the 10&#8208;Year Milestone of Monolithic Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells have attracted significant attention for their potential to surpass the single&#8208;junction Shockley&#8211;Queisser limit. This review highlights the milestones and advancements in monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells over the past decade. It covers research progress and challenges, and provides a roadmap for developing efficient, scalable, and stable tandem solar cells.








Abstract
The perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell represents one of the most promising avenues for exceeding the Shockley&#8211;Queisser limit for single&#8208;junction solar cells at a reasonable cost. Remarkably, its efficiency has rapidly increased from 13.7% in 2015 to 34.6% in 2024. Despite the significant research efforts dedicated to this topic, the &#8220;secret&#8221; to achieving high&#8208;performance perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells seems to be confined to a few research groups. Additionally, the discrepancies in preparation and characterization between single&#8208;junction and tandem solar cells continue to impede the transition from efficient single&#8208;junction to efficient tandem solar cells. This review first revisits the key milestones in the development of monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells over the past decade. Then, a comprehensive analysis of the background, advancements, and challenges in perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells is provided, following the sequence of the tandem fabrication process. The progress and limitations of the prevalent stability measurements for tandem devices are also discussed. Finally, a roadmap for designing efficient, scalable, and stable perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells is outlined. This review takes the growth history into consideration while charting the future course of perovskite/silicon tandem research.

         <title>SonoPrint: Acoustically Assisted Volumetric 3D Printing for Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SonoPrint merges sound energy with volumetric printing to create composite materials with aligned reinforcement patterning. This innovative 3D printing technique embeds particles such as glass, metal, and polystyrene into photosensitive resin, forming intricate motifs and mechanically tunable geometries. Completing prints in minutes, SonoPrint enhances structural properties and advances applications in biohybrid robots, tissue engineering, and composite fabrication, broadening the horizons of volumetric printing.








Abstract
Advances in additive manufacturing in composites have transformed aerospace, medical devices, tissue engineering, and electronics. A key aspect of enhancing properties of 3D&#8208;printed objects involves fine&#8208;tuning the material by embedding and orienting reinforcement within the structure. Existing methods for orienting these reinforcements are limited by pattern types, alignment, and particle characteristics. Acoustics offers a versatile method to control the particles independent of their size, geometry, and charge, enabling intricate pattern formations. However, integrating acoustics into 3D printing has been challenging due to the scattering of the acoustic field between polymerized layers and unpolymerized resin, resulting in unwanted patterns. To address this challenge, SonoPrint, an innovative acoustically assisted volumetric 3D printer is developed that enables simultaneous reinforcement patterning and printing of the entire structure. SonoPrint generates mechanically tunable composite geometries by embedding reinforcement particles, such as microscopic glass, metal, and polystyrene, within the fabricated structure. This printer employs a standing wave field to create targeted particle motifs&#8208;including parallel lines, radial lines, circles, rhombuses, hexagons, and polygons&#8208;directly in the photosensitive resin, completing the print in just a few minutes. SonoPrint enhances structural properties and promises to advance volumetric printing, unlocking applications in tissue engineering, biohybrid robots, and composite fabrication.

         <title>Achieving Ultrasound&#8208;Excited Emission with Organic Mechanoluminescent Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrasound (US)&#8208;excited fluorescence and phosphorescence with emission wavelengths extending into the near&#8208;infrared region are achieved using organic mechanoluminescent materials exhibiting high photoluminescence quantum yields, persistent room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence, and adjustable aggregated structures in the crystalline state. Accordingly, US&#8208;excited in vivo phosphorescence imaging of living mice is performed using a mechanoluminescence&#8208;based capsule device.








Abstract
Unlike traditional photoluminescence (PL), mechanoluminescence (ML) achieved under mechanical excitation demonstrates unique characteristics such as high penetrability, spatial resolution, and signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio (SBR) for bioimaging applications. However, bioimaging with organic mechanoluminescent materials remains challenging because of the shallow penetration depth of ML with short emission wavelengths and the absence of a suitable mechanical force to generate ML in vivo. To resolve these issues, the present paper reports the achievement of ultrasound (US)&#8208;excited fluorescence and phosphorescence from purely organic luminogens for the first time with emission wavelengths extending to the red/NIR region, with the penetrability of the US&#8208;excited emission being considerably higher than that of PL. Consequently, US&#8208;excited subcutaneous phosphorescence imaging can be achieved using a mechanoluminescent&#8208;luminogen&#8208;based capsule device with a quantified intensity of 9.15 &#177; 1.32 &#215; 104 p s&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 sr&#8722;1 and an SBR of 24. Moreover, the US&#8208;excited emission can be adequately tuned using the packing modes of the conjugated skeletons, dipole orientation of mechanoluminescent luminogens, and strength and direction of intermolecular interactions. Overall, this study innovatively expands the kind of excitation sources and the emission wavelengths of organic mechanoluminescent materials, paving the way for practical biological applications based on US&#8208;excited emission.

         <title>Ultrahigh Responsivity and Robust Semiconducting Fiber Enabled by Molecular Soldering&#8208;Governed Defect Engineering for Smart Textile Optoelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile molecular soldering&#8208;governed defect engineering strategy is proposed to simultaneously control the microscale, mesoscale, and macroscale structural defects in wet&#8208;spun MoS2 semiconducting fibers, which affords two orders of magnitude enhancement in responsivity and remarkable mechanical robustness, thus enabling large&#8208;scale weaving of reliable smart textile optoelectronic systems.








Abstract
Semiconducting fibers (SCFs) are of significant interest to design next&#8208;generation wearable and comfortable optoelectronics that seamlessly integrate with textiles. However, the practical applications of current SCFs are always limited by poor optoelectronic performance and low mechanical robustness caused by uncontrollable multiscale structural defects. Herein, a versatile in situ molecular soldering&#8208;governed defect engineering strategy is proposed to construct ultrahigh responsivity and robust wet&#8208;spun MoS2 SCFs, by using a &#960;&#8208;conjugated dithiolated molecule to simultaneously patch microscale sulfur vacancies within MoS2 nanosheets, diminish mesoscale interlayer voids/wrinkles, promote macroscale orientation, build long&#8208;range photoelectron percolation bridges, and provide n&#8208;doping effect. The derived MoS2 SCFs exhibit over two orders of magnitude higher responsivity (144.3 A W&#8722;1) than previously reported fiber photodetectors, 37.3&#8208;fold faster photoresponse speed (52&#160;ms) than pristine counterpart, and remarkable bending robustness (retain 94.2% of the initial photocurrent after 50&#160;000 bending&#8208;flattening cycles). Such superior robustness and photodetection capacity of MoS2 SCFs further enable large&#8208;scale weaving of reliable smart textile optoelectronic systems, such as direction&#8208;identifiable wireless light alarming system, modularized mechano&#8208;optical communication system, and indoor light&#8208;controlled IoT system. This work offers a universal strategy for the scalable production of mechanically robust and high&#8208;performance SCFs, opening up exciting possibilities for large&#8208;scale integration of wearable optoelectronics.

         <title>Charge&#8208;Transfer Complexes: Fundamentals and Advances in Catalysis, Sensing, and Optoelectronic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charge&#8208;transfer complexes (CTCs), formed through electron transfer between electron donor (D) and electron acceptor (A) components, present unprecedented capabilities for diverse applications. As semiconductors, they offer tunable bandgap and charge&#8208;transport properties. Their flexible chemistry allows tailoring matter at the molecular and atomic levels. Owing to these unique features, CTCs are promising candidates for applications in catalysis, optoelectronics, and sensing.








Abstract
Supramolecular assemblies, formed through electronic charge transfer between two or more entities, represent a rich class of compounds dubbed as charge&#8208;transfer complexes (CTCs). Their distinctive formation pathway, rooted in charge&#8208;transfer processes at the interface of CTC&#8208;forming components, results in the delocalization of electronic charge along molecular stacks, rendering CTCs intrinsic molecular conductors. Since the discovery of CTCs, intensive research has explored their unique properties including magnetism, conductivity, and superconductivity. Their more recently recognized semiconducting functionality has inspired recent developments in applications requiring organic semiconductors. In this context, CTCs offer a tuneable energy gap, unique charge&#8208;transport properties, tailorable physicochemical interactions, photoresponsiveness, and the potential for scalable manufacturing. Here, an updated viewpoint on CTCs is provided, presenting them as emerging organic semiconductors. To this end, their electronic and chemical properties alongside their synthesis methods are reviewed. The unique properties of CTCs that benefit various related applications in the realms of organic optoelectronics, catalysts, and gas sensors are discussed. Insights for future developments and existing limitations are described.

         <title>Embedded Skyrmion Bags in Thin Films of Chiral Magnets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the first experimental observations of magnetic skyrmion bags embedded within skyrmion lattices in thin plates of B20&#8208;type FeGe. By utilizing Lorentz transmission electron microscopy, the extraordinary stability of embedded skyrmion bags, which remain stable even in zero or inverted external magnetic fields, is observed directly. A robust protocol for nucleating such embedded skyrmion bags is provided.








Abstract
Magnetic skyrmions are topologically nontrivial spin configurations that possess particle&#8208;like properties. Earlier research has mainly focused on a specific type of skyrmion with topological charge Q = &#8722;1. However, theoretical analyses of 2D chiral magnets have predicted the existence of skyrmion bags&#8212;solitons with arbitrary positive or negative topological charge. Although such spin textures are metastable states, recent experimental observations have confirmed the stability of isolated skyrmion bags in a limited range of applied magnetic fields. Here, by utilizing Lorentz transmission electron microscopy, the extraordinary stability of skyrmion bags in thin plates of B20&#8208;type FeGe is shown. In particular, it is shown that skyrmion bags embedded within a skyrmion lattice remain stable even in zero or inverted external magnetic fields. A robust protocol for nucleating such embedded skyrmion bags is provided. The results agree perfectly with micromagnetic simulations and establish thin plates of cubic chiral magnets as a powerful platform for exploring a broad spectrum of topological magnetic&#160;solitons.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;high Performance Thermochromic Polymers via a Solid&#8208;solid Phase Transition Mechanism and Their Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lightly cross&#8208;linked alkyl acrylates can function as thermochromic materials with ultrahigh transparency and solar&#8208;modulating abilities via a crystalline&#8208;to&#8208;amorphous polymer transition. When used as greenhouse materials or coupled with thermoelectric devices, the thermochromic layer is able to function as a thermal valve.








Abstract
Thermochromic materials are substances that change color in response to temperature variations. Today, sustainability concerns are the main drivers of thermochromic research, with smart, energy&#8208;efficient windows being one of the primary applications. While vanadium oxides and leuco dyes are traditionally the main thermochromic materials, hydrogels operating based on change of solvation have risen as some of the most promising materials due to their high optical transparency and good solar modulating abilities. In this work, a distinct mechanism for thermochromism arising from the crystalline solid to amorphous solid polymer transition, with a corresponding transition from an opaque state to a transparent state is disclosed. Both ultra&#8208;high optical transparency (Tlum up to 99%) and ultra&#8208;high solar modulation (&#916;Tsolar up to 87%) are observed. The transition temperature is tunable from 11 to 61&#160;&#176;C by tuning the polymer structure. When incorporated into applications such as greenhouse materials and thermoelectric devices, significant performance enhancement is observed, due to the thermochromic material functioning as a thermal valve, speeding up solar heat absorbance while inhibiting the cooling process via its phase transition.

In this work, a distinct mechanism for thermochromism arising from the crystalline solid to amorphous solid polymer transition, with a corresponding transition from an opaque state to a transparent state is disclosed. Both ultra-high optical transparency (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt; up to 99%) and ultra-high solar modulation (&#916;&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;solar&lt;/sub&gt; up to 87%) are observed. The transition temperature is tunable from 11 to 61&#160;&#176;C by tuning the polymer structure. When incorporated into applications such as greenhouse materials and thermoelectric devices, significant performance enhancement is observed, due to the thermochromic material functioning as a thermal valve, speeding up solar heat absorbance while inhibiting the cooling process via its phase transition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Bioinspired Photosensitizer Performs Tumor Thermoresistance Reversion to Optimize the Atraumatic Mild&#8208;Hyperthermia Photothermal Therapy for Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired photosensitizer decorated with pendant leucines is introduced to achieve rapid and homogeneous accumulation in tumors. CP&#8208;PLeu exerts a photodynamic effect to reverse tumor thermoresistance and physiological repair mechanisms, thereby inhibiting tumor antagonism and optimizing atraumatic mild&#8208;hyperthermia photothermal therapy for breast cancer.








Abstract
Mild&#8208;hyperthermia photothermal therapy (mPTT) has therapeutic potential with minimized damage to normal tissues. However, the poorly vascularized tumor area severely hampers the penetration of photothermal agents (PTAs), resulting in their heterogeneous distribution and the subsequent heterogeneous local temperature during mPTT. The presence of regions below the therapeutic 42 &#176;C threshold can lead to incomplete tumor ablation and potential recurrence. Additionally, tumor anti&#8208;apoptosis and cytoprotection pathways, particularly activated thermoresistance, can nullify mild hyperthermia&#8208;induced tumor damage. Therefore, a bioinspired photosensitizer decorated with leucine to form biomimetic nanoclusters (CP&#8208;PLeu nanoparticles (NPs)) aimed at achieving rapid and homogeneous accumulation in tumors, is introduced. Moreover, CP&#8208;PLeu exhibits photodynamic effects that reverse tumor thermoresistance and physiological repair mechanisms, thereby inhibiting tumor resistance to hyperthermia. With the addition of NIR&#8208;II laser irradiation, CP&#8208;PLeu optimizes the therapeutic efficacy of mPTT and contributes to a minimally invasive therapeutic process for breast cancer. This therapeutic strategy, utilizing a biomimetic photosensitizer for homogeneous distribution of therapeutic temperature and photoactivated reversal of tumor thermoresistance, successfully achieves efficient breast tumor inhibition through an atraumatic mPTT process.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Intermetallic Heterostructure on Hierarchical Nanoporous Metal for Highly Efficient Alkaline Hydrogen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;intermetallic heterostructure composed of tungsten&#8208;bridged Co3W and WNi4 intermetallic compounds seamlessly integrated on nanoporous Ni skeleton exhibits exceptional activities and durability for hydrogen evolution and oxidation reactions. Such dual&#8208;intermetallic heterostructure enables interfacial atoms to configure multisites to accelerate water dissociation/combination, demonstrating the feasibility to construct well&#8208;defined active multisites for multiple&#8208;intermediate reactions based on intermetallic compounds.








Abstract
Constructing well&#8208;defined active multisites is an effective strategy to break linear scaling relationships to develop high&#8208;efficiency catalysts toward multiple&#8208;intermediate reactions. Here, dual&#8208;intermetallic heterostructure composed of tungsten&#8208;bridged Co3W and WNi4 intermetallic compounds seamlessly integrated on hierarchical nanoporous nickel skeleton is reported as a high&#8208;performance nonprecious electrocatalyst for alkaline hydrogen evolution and oxidation reactions. By virtue of interfacial tungsten atoms configuring contiguous multisites with proper adsorptions of hydrogen and hydroxyl intermediates to accelerate water dissociation/combination and column&#8208;nanostructured nickel skeleton facilitating electron and ion/molecule transportations, nanoporous nickel&#8208;supported Co3W&#8211;WNi4 heterostructure exhibits exceptional hydrogen electrocatalysis in alkaline media, with outstanding durability and impressive catalytic activities for hydrogen oxidation reaction (geometric exchange current density of &#8776;6.62 mA cm&#8722;2) and hydrogen evolution reaction (current density of &#8776;1.45 A cm&#8722;2 at overpotential of 200 mV). Such atom&#8208;ordered intermetallic heterostructure alternative to platinum group metals shows genuine potential for hydrogen production and utilization in hydroxide&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane water electrolyzers and fuel cells.

         <title>Piezoelectric Analgesia Blocks Cancer&#8208;Induced Bone Pain</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This polyvinylpyrrolidone modified Aurivillius structure BiOIO3 nanosheets (BIONSs) are synthesized via a hydrothermal process. Ultrasound can trigger BIONSs to generate local electrical field, internalizing transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) rapidly and substantially decreasing the expression of TRPV1. With the reduction of TRPV1, the Ca2+ signal in spinal neuron is obviously decreased and the activity of wide range dynamic neurons is inhibited, accompanying the reduction of some neuropeptides and the change of inflammatory cytokines, resulting cancer induced bone pain relief for up to 6&#160;h.








Abstract
The manipulation of cell surface receptors&#8217; activity will open a new frontier for drug development and disease treatment. However, limited by the desensitization of drugs, effective physical intervention strategy remains challenging. Here, the controllable internalization of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) on neural cells by local piezoelectric field is reported. Single&#8208;cell&#8208;level local electric field is construct by synthesizing piezoelectric BiOIO3 nanosheets (BIONSs). Upon a mild ultrasound of 0.08&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2, an electric field of 15.29&#160;&#181;V is generated on the surface of BIONSs, further inducing TRPV1 internalization in 5&#160;min. The as&#8208;downregulated TRPV1 expression results in the reduction of Ca2+ signal in a spinal neuron and the inhibition of the activity of wide range dynamic neurons, therefore effectively preventing the transmission of cancer&#8208;induced bone pain (CIBP). This strategy not only charts a new course for CIBP alleviation, but also introduces a promising nanotechnology for regulating cell surface receptors, showing significant potential in neuropathological and receptor&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>Gold Nanocluster: A Photoelectric Converter for X&#8208;Ray&#8208;Activated Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold nanocluster triggers platinum (Pt)&#8208;based prodrugs activation through direct electron transfer from the excited state of the gold nanocluster to the Pt(IV) center under X&#8208;ray radiation, circulating the limitation of indirect reactive species that easily quenched in living tumor cells. This spatiotemporally synchronous radiotherapy&#8208;directed chemotherapy offers excellent antitumor performance, and leads to superior outcomes for combined treatment.








Abstract
Despite the promise of activatable chemotherapy, the development of a spatiotemporally controllable strategy for prodrug activation in deep tissues remains challenging. Herein, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept is proposed for a gold nanocluster&#8208;based strategy that utilizes X&#8208;ray irradiation to trigger the liberation of platinum (Pt)&#8208;based prodrug conjugates, thus enabling radiotherapy&#8208;directed chemotherapy. Mechanistically, the irradiated activation of prodrugs is achieved through direct photoelectron transfer from the excited&#8208;state gold nanoclusters to the Pt(IV) center, resulting in the release of cytotoxic Pt(II) agents. Compared to the traditional combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, this radiotherapy&#8208;directed chemotherapy strategy offers superior antitumor efficacy and safety benefits through spatiotemporal synergy at the tumor site. Additionally, this strategy elicits robust immunogenic cell death and yields profound outcomes for combined immunotherapy of breast cancer. This versatile strategy is ushering in a new era of radiation&#8208;mediated chemistry for controlled drug delivery and the precise regulation of biological processes.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Multidirectional Bending in Artificial Muscles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fast light&#8208;triggered multidirectional bending is demonstrated in soft twist&#8208;coiled artificial muscles. The bending direction is dictated by the direction of the light leading to localized untwisting of the muscle. These artificial muscles can autonomously turn toward a light source, and they can be programmed for selective, reversible, and sustained actuation when integrated in textiles.








Abstract
Using light to drive polymer actuators can enable spatially selective complex motions, offering a wealth of opportunities for wireless control of soft robotics and active textiles. Here, the integration of photothermal components is reported into shape memory polymer actuators. The fabricated twist&#8208;coiled artificial muscles show on&#8208;command multidirectional bending, which can be controlled by both the illumination intensity, as well as the chirality, of the prepared artificial muscles. Importantly, the direction in which these artificial muscles bend does not depend on intrinsic material characteristics. Instead, this directionality is achieved by localized untwisting of the actuator, driven by selective irradiation. The reaction times of this bending system are significantly &#8211; at least two orders of magnitude &#8211; faster than heliotropic biological systems, with a response time up to one second. The programmability of the artificial muscles is further demonstrated for selective, reversible, and sustained actuation when integrated in butterfly&#8208;shaped textiles, along with the capacity to autonomously orient toward a light source. This functionality is maintained even on a rotating platform, with angular velocities of 6&#176;/s, independent of the rotation direction. These attributes collectively represent a breakthrough in the field of artificial muscles, intended to adaptive shape&#8208;changing soft systems and biomimetic technologies.

     alt="Light-Driven Multidirectional Bending in Artificial Muscles"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast light-triggered multidirectional bending is demonstrated in soft twist-coiled artificial muscles. The bending direction is dictated by the direction of the light leading to localized untwisting of the muscle. These artificial muscles can autonomously turn toward a light source, and they can be programmed for selective, reversible, and sustained actuation when integrated in textiles.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using light to drive polymer actuators can enable spatially selective complex motions, offering a wealth of opportunities for wireless control of soft robotics and active textiles. Here, the integration of photothermal components is reported into shape memory polymer actuators. The fabricated twist-coiled artificial muscles show on-command multidirectional bending, which can be controlled by both the illumination intensity, as well as the chirality, of the prepared artificial muscles. Importantly, the direction in which these artificial muscles bend does not depend on intrinsic material characteristics. Instead, this directionality is achieved by localized untwisting of the actuator, driven by selective irradiation. The reaction times of this bending system are significantly &#8211; at least two orders of magnitude &#8211; faster than heliotropic biological systems, with a response time up to one second. The programmability of the artificial muscles is further demonstrated for selective, reversible, and sustained actuation when integrated in butterfly-shaped textiles, along with the capacity to autonomously orient toward a light source. This functionality is maintained even on a rotating platform, with angular velocities of 6&#176;/s, independent of the rotation direction. These attributes collectively represent a breakthrough in the field of artificial muscles, intended to adaptive shape-changing soft systems and biomimetic technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhanced SWIR Light Detection in Organic Semiconductor Photodetectors through Up&#8208;Conversion of Mid&#8208;Gap Trap States</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy for creating shortwave&#8208;infrared (SWIR) photo&#8208;response in organic photodiodes by utilizing mid&#8208;gap states through &#8216;trap&#8208;doping&#8217; is presented. This involves incorporating small amounts of a guest organic molecule into a semiconducting donor:acceptor host system. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for a visible&#8208;SWIR broadband organic photodiode is demonstrated.








Abstract
Shortwave&#8208;infrared (SWIR) photodetectors are vital for many scientific and industrial applications including surveillance, quality control and inspection. In recent decades, photodetectors based on organic semiconductors have emerged, demonstrating potential to add real value to broadband and narrowband imaging and sensing scenarios, where factors such as thermal budget sensitivity, large area aperture necessity, cost considerations, and lightweight and conformal flexibility demands are prioritized. It is now recognized that the performance of organic photodetectors (OPDs), notably their specific detectivity, is ultimately limited by trap states, universally present in disordered semiconductors. This work adopts an approach of utilizing these mid&#8208;gap states to specifically create a SWIR photo&#8208;response. To this end, this work introduces a somewhat counter&#8208;intuitive approach of &#8220;trap&#8208;doping&#8221; in bulk heterojunction (BHJs) photodiodes, where small quantities of a guest organic molecule are intentionally incorporated into a semiconducting donor:acceptor host system. Following this approach, this work demonstrates a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for a visible&#8208;to&#8208;SWIR broadband OPD, approaching (and, to some extent, even exceeding) state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance across critical photodetector metrics. The trap&#8208;doping approach is, even though only a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept currently, broadly applicable to various spectral windows. It represents a new modality for engineering photodetection using the unconventional strategy of turning a limitation into a feature.

         <dc:description>
Implantable devices significantly enhance healthcare but are limited by battery life. Ultrasound power transfer technology offers a promising solution for sustainable operation. This review addresses gaps in current research, particularly in sound field analysis and energy efficiency optimization. It proposes an energy flow diagram, discusses development stages, and explores the potential advancements in ultrasound&#8208;based healthcare solutions.








Abstract
Implantable medical devices (IMDs), like pacemakers regulating heart rhythm or deep brain stimulators treating neurological disorders, revolutionize healthcare. However, limited battery life necessitates frequent surgeries for replacements. Ultrasound power transfer (UPT) emerges as a promising solution for sustainable IMD operation. Current research prioritizes implantable materials, with less emphasis on sound field analysis and maximizing energy transfer during wireless power delivery. This review addresses this gap. A comprehensive analysis of UPT technology, examining cutting&#8208;edge system designs, particularly in power supply and efficiency is provided. The review critically examines existing efficiency models, summarizing the key parameters influencing energy transmission in UPT systems. For the first time, an energy flow diagram of a general UPT system is proposed to offer insights into the overall functioning. Additionally, the review explores the development stages of UPT technology, showcasing representative designs and applications. The remaining challenges, future directions, and exciting opportunities associated with UPT are discussed. By highlighting the importance of sustainable IMDs with advanced functions like biosensing and closed&#8208;loop drug delivery, as well as UPT's potential, this review aims to inspire further research and advancements in this promising field.

         <title>Vertically Phase Separated Photomultiplication Organic Photodetectors with p&#8208;n Heterojunction Type Ultrafast Dynamic Characteristics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vertical donor&#8211;acceptor phase separation in photomultiplication organic photodetectors induces a partial p&#8208;n heterojunction character with remarkably improved dynamic properties while maintaining high external quantum efficiency and detectivity. The strategy marks a pioneering achievement by showcasing the simultaneous presence of p&#8208;n heterojunction and photomultiplication modes within a single photoactive layer for the first time.








Abstract
Photomultiplication (PM)&#8208;type organic photodetectors (OPDs), which typically form a homogeneous distribution (HD) of n&#8208;type dopants in a p&#8208;type polymer host (HD PM&#8208;type OPDs), have achieved a breakthrough in device responsivity by surpassing a theoretical limit of external quantum efficiency (EQE). However, they face limitations in higher dark current and slower dynamic characteristics compared to p&#8208;n heterojunction (p&#8208;n HJ) OPDs due to inherent long lifetime of trapped electrons. To overcome this, a new PM&#8208;type OPD is developed that demonstrates ultrafast dynamic properties through a vertical phase separation (VPS) strategy between the p&#8208;type polymer and n&#8208;type acceptor, referred to as VPS PM&#8208;type OPDs. Notably, VPS PM&#8208;type OPDs show three orders of magnitude&#160;increase in &#8722;3&#160;dB cut&#8208;off frequency (120&#160;kHz) and over a 200&#8208;fold faster response time (rising time = 4.8 &#181;s, falling time = 8.3 &#181;s) compared to HD PM&#8208;type OPDs, while maintaining high EQE of 1121% and specific detectivity of 2.53 &#215; 1013 Jones at &#8722;10&#160;V. The VPS PM&#8208;type OPD represents a groundbreaking advancement by demonstrating the coexistence of p&#8208;n HJ and PM modes within a single photoactive layer for the first time. This innovative approach holds the potential to enhance both static and dynamic properties of OPDs.

         <title>Asymmetric Atomic Dual&#8208;Sites for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structure&#8211;property relationship between the asymmetric atomic dual sites and the CO2RR is reviewed. A timely reference for researchers engages in the design and development of photocatalyst to explore a promising approach for complex photocatalytic conversion pathways. Some perspectives are provided for achieving efficient and sustainable photocatalysis based on tailoring strategies, design of active sites, and future challenges.








Abstract
Atomically dispersed active sites in a photocatalyst offer unique advantages such as locally tuned electronic structures, quantum size effects, and maximum utilization of atomic species. Among these, asymmetric atomic dual&#8208;sites are of particular interest because their asymmetric charge distribution generates a local built&#8208;in electric potential to enhance charge separation and transfer. Moreover, the dual sites provide flexibility for tuning complex multielectron and multireaction pathways, such as CO2 reduction reactions. The coordination of dual sites opens new possibilities for engineering the structure&#8211;activity&#8211;selectivity relationship. This comprehensive overview discusses efficient and sustainable photocatalysis processes in photocatalytic CO2 reduction, focusing on strategic active&#8208;site design and future challenges. It serves as a timely reference for the design and development of photocatalytic conversion processes, specifically exploring the utilization of asymmetric atomic dual&#8208;sites for complex photocatalytic conversion pathways, here exemplified by the conversion of CO2 into valuable chemicals.

         <title>Negative Photoconductivity Transistors for Visuomorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Significant progress has been made in visuomorphic computing, but challenges remain in perceiving complex interactive environments. This review is the first to discuss the development and application of NPTs in the field of visuomorphic computing and provides a good reference for others to design lower power consumption, multivisual task coordinated, and multisensory fused artificial vision systems.








Abstract
Visuomorphic computing aims to simulate and potentially surpass the human retina by mimicking biological visual perception with an artificial retina. Despite significant progress, challenges persist in perceiving complex interactive environments. Negative photoconductivity transistors (NPTs) mimic synaptic behavior by achieving adjustable positive photoconductivity (PPC) and negative photoconductivity (NPC), simulating &#8220;excitation&#8221; and &#8220;inhibition&#8221; akin to sensory cell signals. In complex interactive environments, NPTs are desired for visuomorphic computing that can achieve a better sense of information, lower power consumption, and reduce hardware complexity. In this review, it is started by introducing the development process of NPTs, while placing a strong emphasis on the device structures, working mechanisms, and key performance parameters. The common material systems employed in NPTs based on their functions are then summarized. Moreover, it is proceeded to summarize the noteworthy applications of NPTs in optoelectronic devices, including advanced multibit nonvolatile memory, optoelectronic logic gates, optical encryption, and visual perception. Finally, the challenges and prospects that lie ahead in the ongoing development of NPTs are addressed, offering valuable insights into their applications in optoelectronics and a comprehensive understanding of their significance.

         <title>Ionic Photovoltaics&#8208;in&#8208;Memory in van der Waals Material</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ionic photovoltaics&#8208;in&#8208;memory has been found&#160;in centrosymmetric CdSb2Se3Br2. The migration of Br ions induces a reversible modulation of the built&#8208;in electric field, resulting in significant anisotropy and electrically&#8208;induced nonvolatile photovoltaic currents. Consequently, a highly secure circuit with electrical and optical keys is implemented. It&#160;opens up new possibilities for cutting&#8208;edge optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
The photovoltaic effect is gaining growing attention in the optoelectronics field due to its low power consumption, sustainable nature, and high efficiency. However, the photovoltaic effects hitherto reported are hindered by the stringent band&#8208;alignment requirement or inversion symmetry&#8208;breaking, and are challenging for achieving multifunctional photovoltaic properties (such as reconfiguration, nonvolatility, and so on). Here, a novel ionic photovoltaic effect in centrosymmetric CdSb2Se3Br2 that can overcome these limitations is demonstrated. The photovoltaic effect displays significant anisotropy, with the photocurrent being most apparent along the CdBr2 chains while absent perpendicular to them. Additionally, the device shows electrically&#8208;induced nonvolatile photocurrent switching characteristics. The photovoltaic effect is attributed to the modulation of the built&#8208;in electric field through the migration of Br ions. Using these unique photovoltaic properties, a highly secure circuit with electrical and optical keys is successfully implemented. The findings not only broaden the understanding of the photovoltaic mechanism, but also provide a new material platform for the development of in&#8208;memory sensing and computing devices.

         <title>In Situ Triggered Self&#8208;Contraction Bioactive Microgel Assembly Accelerates Diabetic Skin Wound Healing by Activating Mechanotransduction and Biochemical Pathway</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SMART&#8208;EXO, a self&#8208;contraction bioactive core&#8211;shell microgel dressing with robust tissue&#8208;adhesion, enhances diabetic wound healing by enabling tunable contraction, activating mechanotransduction, and releasing bioactive exosomes. This dressing promotes fibroblast&#8208;to&#8208;myofibroblast conversion, collagen synthesis, angiogenesis, and re&#8208;epithelialization. RNA&#8208;seq results reveal activation of critical signaling pathways associated with mechanosensing and exosome regulation, highlighting the mechanisms of combining biomechanical and biochemical cues.








Abstract
Chronic nonhealing skin wounds, characterized by reduced tissue contractility and inhibited wound cell survival under hyperglycemia and hypoxia, present a significant challenge in diabetic care. Here, an advanced self&#8208;contraction bioactive core&#8208;shell microgel assembly with robust tissue&#8208;adhesion (SMART&#8208;EXO) is introduced to expedite diabetic wound healing. The SMART&#8208;EXO dressing exhibits strong, reversible adhesion to damaged tissue due to abundant hydrogen and dynamic coordination bonds. Additionally, the core&#8208;shell microgel components and dynamic coordination bonds provide moderate rigidity, customizable self&#8208;contraction, and an interlinked porous architecture. The triggered in situ self&#8208;contraction of the SMART&#8208;EXO dressing enables active, tunable wound contraction, activating mechanotransduction in the skin and promoting the optimal fibroblast&#8208;to&#8208;myofibroblast conversion, collagen synthesis, and angiogenesis. Concurrently, the triggered contraction of SMART&#8208;EXO facilitates efficient loading and on&#8208;demand release of bioactive exosomes, contributing to re&#8208;epithelialization and wound microenvironment regulation in diabetic mice. RNA&#8208;seq results reveal the activation of critical signaling pathways associated with mechanosensing and exosome regulation, highlighting the combined biomechanical and biochemical mechanisms. These findings underscore SMART&#8208;EXO as a versatile, adaptable solution to the complex challenges of diabetic wound care.

         <title>Bidirectional, Multilayer MXene/Polyimide Aerogels for Ultra&#8208;Broadband Microwave Absorption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To obtain high&#8208;performance microwave absorption materials, designing structures has proved as a promising way. Herein, ultra&#8208;broadband multilayer bidirectional MXene/polyimide aerogel absorbers containing multi&#8208;structures ranging from the micro&#8208; to the macroscopic are produced with the aid of electric and temperature fields.

Abstract
To obtain high&#8208;performance electromagnetic microwave (EM) absorption materials with broad effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) and reduced thickness, designing structures has proved to be a promising way. Herein, ultra&#8208;broadband multilayer bidirectional MXene/polyimide EM absorption aerogels containing multi&#8208;structures on scales ranging from the micro&#8208; to the macroscale are produced with the aid of electric and temperature fields. On the microscale, under the action of electric force and temperature gradient, the ordered structures made of aligned Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets and the microscale layered aerogel walls enable the bidirectional aerogel to achieve a wide EAB of 8.58&#160;GHz at a thickness of 2.1&#160;mm. This is ascribed to the numerous aligned nanosheets and layered aerogel walls perpendicular to the incident EMs, facilitating the conversion of electromagnetic energy into electrical energy. Furthermore, on the macroscale, the multilayer bidirectional aerogel with non&#8208;gradient structures effectively resolves the conflict between impedance matching and energy loss, resulting in an ultrawide EAB of 9.41&#160;GHz at a thickness of 3&#160;mm. This innovative design of electric&#8208;field&#8208;assisted multilayer bidirectional aerogels with multiscale structural coupling may provide feasible and effective pathways for the development of advanced EM absorption materials.

         <title>Plasmonic Nanostructures Grown from Reacting Droplet&#8208;In&#8208;Microwell Array on Flexible Films for Quantitative Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy in Plant Wearable In Situ Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A micro&#8208;well structured plasmonic film with in situ grown dendritic Ag nanostructures is developed for plant wearable surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) detection. The film capitalizes on the concentration enrichment of analytes through droplet evaporation within the microwell, facilitating ultrasensitive detection. Additionally, this film offers dual&#8208;sided detection and allows for multiplexed identification of target analytes, expanding its utility in precision agriculture, bio&#8208;sensing, and environmental surveillance.








Abstract
Plant wearable detection has garnered significant interest in advancing agricultural intelligence and promoting sustainable food production amidst the challenges of climate change. Accurately monitoring plant health and agrochemical residue levels necessitates qualities such as precision, affordability, simplicity, and noninvasiveness. Here, a novel attachable plasmonic film is introduced and designed for on&#8208;site detection of agrochemical residues utilizing surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). By functionalizing a thin polydimethylsiloxane film with silver nanoparticles via controlled droplet reactions in micro&#8208;well arrays, a plasmonic film is achieved that not only maintains optical transparency for precise analyte localization but also conforms closely to the plant surface, facilitating highly sensitive SERS measurements. The reliability of this film enables accurate identification and quantification of individual compounds and their mixtures, boasting an ultra&#8208;low detection limit ranging from 10&#8722;16 to 10&#8722;13 m, with mini mal relative standard deviation. To showcase its potential, on&#8208;field detection of pesticide residues on fruit surfaces is conducted using a handheld Raman spectrometer. This advancement in fabricating plasmonic nanostructures on flexible films holds promise for expanding SERS applications beyond plant monitoring, including personalized health monitoring, point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnosis, wearable devices for human&#8211;machine interface, and on&#8208;site monitoring of environmental&#160;pollutants.

&lt;p&gt;Plant wearable detection has garnered significant interest in advancing agricultural intelligence and promoting sustainable food production amidst the challenges of climate change. Accurately monitoring plant health and agrochemical residue levels necessitates qualities such as precision, affordability, simplicity, and noninvasiveness. Here, a novel attachable plasmonic film is introduced and designed for on-site detection of agrochemical residues utilizing surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). By functionalizing a thin polydimethylsiloxane film with silver nanoparticles via controlled droplet reactions in micro-well arrays, a plasmonic film is achieved that not only maintains optical transparency for precise analyte localization but also conforms closely to the plant surface, facilitating highly sensitive SERS measurements. The reliability of this film enables accurate identification and quantification of individual compounds and their mixtures, boasting an ultra-low detection limit ranging from 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;16&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;13&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;, with mini mal relative standard deviation. To showcase its potential, on-field detection of pesticide residues on fruit surfaces is conducted using a handheld Raman spectrometer. This advancement in fabricating plasmonic nanostructures on flexible films holds promise for expanding SERS applications beyond plant monitoring, including personalized health monitoring, point-of-care diagnosis, wearable devices for human&#8211;machine interface, and on-site monitoring of environmental&#160;pollutants.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Scalable Fabrication of Large&#8208;Scale, 3D, and Stretchable Circuits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D&#8208;LSC enables the fabrication of large&#8208;scale, 3D, and stretchable circuits. Soft copper&#8208;clad laminates and multiple types of VIAs are employed to create large&#8208;scale planar interconnects and vertical interconnects. A temporary bonding strategy is proposed to mitigate misalignment with residual and thermal strains. 3D&#8208;LSC facilitates batch production of miniaturized multifunctional devices and the fabrication of large&#8208;scale stretchable devices.








Abstract
Stretchable electronics have demonstrated excellent potential in wearable healthcare and conformal integration. Achieving the scalable fabrication of stretchable devices with high functional density is the cornerstone to enable the practical applications of stretchable electronics. Here, a comprehensive methodology for realizing large&#8208;scale, 3D, and stretchable circuits (3D&#8208;LSC) is reported. The soft copper&#8208;clad laminate (S&#8208;CCL) based on the &#8220;cast and cure&#8221; process facilitates patterning the planar interconnects with the scale beyond 1 m. With the ability to form through, buried and blind VIAs in the multilayer stack of S&#8208;CCLs, high functional density can be achieved by further creating vertical interconnects in stacked S&#8208;CCLs. The application of temporary bonding substrate effectively minimizes the misalignments caused by residual strain and thermal strain. 3D&#8208;LSC enables the batch production of stretchable skin patches based on five&#8208;layer stretchable&#160;circuits, which can serve as a miniaturized system for physiological signals monitoring with wireless power delivery. The fabrications of conformal antenna and stretchable light&#8208;emitting diode display further illustrate the potential of 3D&#8208;LSC in realizing large&#8208;scale stretchable devices.

         <title>Solvent Engineering of Thermo&#8208;Responsive Hydrogels Facilitates Strong and Large Contractile Actuations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Robust poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAAm) hydrogels are fabricated through solvent engineering. A particular solvent interacts affinitively with the NIPAAm monomer, solubilizes the monomer with extremely high concentration, stabilizes chain propagation during polymerization, and significantly increases chain lengths and entanglements of the resulting hydrogel. The synthesized hydrogels are highly elastic, strong, and tough, displaying remarkable thermo&#8208;responsive contractile actuation.








Abstract
Thermo&#8208;responsive hydrogels can generate the actuation force through volumetric transitions in response to temperature changes. However, their weak mechanical properties and fragile actuation performance limit robust applications. Existing approaches to enhance these properties have typically depended on additional components, leading to an unavoidable interference to the actuation performance. In this work, robust thermo&#8208;responsive hydrogels are fabricated through solvent engineering. A particular solvent, N&#8208;methylformamide, interacts affinitively with the carbonyl group of N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide monomer, solubilizes the monomer with extremely high concentration, stabilizes chain propagation during polymerization, and greatly increases chain lengths and entanglements of the resulting polymer. The synthesized hydrogels are highly elastic, strong, and tough, displaying remarkable thermo&#8208;responsive contractile actuation. The simple synthetic process can broaden its applicability in designing robust functional hydrogel applications.

         <title>Electrically Reconfigurable Phase&#8208;Change Transmissive Metasurface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Active metasurfaces are emerging as a new avenue for creating compact, high&#8208;performance reconfigurable optical devices. This study demonstrates a non&#8208;volatile transmissive metafilter based on low&#8208;loss PCMs deposited on a 200 &#215; 200 &#181;m2 microheater. The metafilter can be electrically switched between low&#8208; and high&#8208;transmission states using no mechanical movements with a switching contrast ratio of 5.5 dB.








Abstract
Programmable and reconfigurable optics hold significant potential for transforming a broad spectrum of applications, spanning space explorations to biomedical imaging, gas sensing, and optical cloaking. The ability to adjust the optical properties of components like filters, lenses, and beam steering devices could result in dramatic reductions in size, weight, and power consumption in future optoelectronic devices. Among the potential candidates for reconfigurable optics, chalcogenide&#8208;based phase change materials (PCMs) offer great promise due to their non&#8208;volatile and analogue switching characteristics. Although PCM have found widespread use in electronic data storage, these memory devices are deeply sub&#8208;micron&#8208;sized. To incorporate phase change materials into free&#8208;space optical components, it is essential to scale them up to beyond several hundreds of microns while maintaining reliable switching characteristics. This study demonstrated a non&#8208;mechanical, non&#8208;volatile transmissive filter based on low&#8208;loss PCMs with a 200 &#215; 200 &#181;m2 switching area. The device/metafilter can be consistently switched between low&#8208; and high&#8208;transmission states using electrical pulses with a switching contrast ratio of 5.5 dB. The device was&#160;reversibly switched for 1250 cycles before accelerated degradation took place. The work represents an important step toward realizing free&#8208;space reconfigurable optics based on&#160;PCMs.

         <title>Strong Elastic Protein Nanosheets Enable the Culture and Differentiation of Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells on Microdroplets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid microcarriers are attractive solutions to enable cell culture in a scalable format, for stem cell manufacturing and applications in regenerative medicine. Here, iPSCs are cultured at the surface of microdroplets for the first time. This process is enabled by the self&#8208;assembly of strong elastic protein nanosheets that stabilize microdroplets, reinforce interfacial mechanics and engage cell adhesion receptors.








Abstract
Advances in stem cell technologies, revolutionizing regenerative therapies and advanced in vitro testing, require novel cell manufacturing pipelines able to cope with scale up and parallelization. Microdroplet technologies, which have transformed single cell sequencing and other cell&#8208;based assays, are attractive in this context, but the inherent soft mechanics of liquid&#8208;liquid interfaces is typically thought to be incompatible with the expansion of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and their differentiation. In this work, the design of protein nanosheets stabilizing liquid&#8208;liquid interfaces and enabling the adhesion, expansion and retention of stemness by iPSCs is reported. Microdroplet microfluidic chips are used to control the formulation of droplets with defined dimensions and size distributions. The resulting emulsions sustain high expansion rates, with excellent retention of stem cell marker expression. iPSCs cultured in such conditions retain the capacity to differentiate into cardiomyocytes. This work provides clear evidence that local nanoscale mechanics, associated with interfacial viscoelasticity, provides strong cues able to regulate and maintain pluripotency, as well as to support commitment in defined differentiation conditions. Microdroplet technologies appear as attractive candidates to transform cell manufacturing pipelines, bypassing significant hurdles paused by solid substrates and microcarriers.

         <title>A Generalized Coordination Engineering Strategy for Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts toward Efficient Hydrogen Peroxide Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
During the generalized coordination engineering strategy, the representative samples Co&#8208;N3O and Ni&#8208;N3S are precisely synthesized, and both of them present excellent activity and H2O2 selectivity (&#8776;90%) compared with conventional Metal&#8208;N4 configurations. Moreover, they enable a high H2O2 production of 14.2 and 17.5 moL&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 in the three&#8208;phrase flow cell and maintain a satisfying stability over 12&#160;h.








Abstract
Designing non&#8208;noble metal single&#8208;atom catalysts (M&#8208;SACs) for two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8208;ORR) is attractive for the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) electrosynthesis, in which the coordination configuration of the M&#8208;SACs essentially affects the reaction activity and product selectivity. Though extensively investigated, a generalized coordination engineering strategy has not yet been proposed, which fundamentally hinders the rational design of M&#8208;SACs with optimized catalytic capabilities. Herein, a generalized coordination engineering strategy is proposed for M&#8208;SACs toward H2O2 electrosynthesis via introducing heteroatoms (e.g., oxygen or sulfur atoms) with higher or lower electronegativity than nitrogen atoms into the first sphere of metal&#8208;N4 system to tailor their electronic structure and adjust the adsorption strength for *OOH intermediates, respectively, thus optimizing their electrocatalytic capability for 2e&#8208;ORR. Specifically, the (O, N)&#8208;coordinated Co SAC (Co&#8208;N3O) and (S, N)&#8208;coordinated Ni SAC (Ni&#8208;N3S) are precisely synthesized, and both present superior 2e&#8208;ORR activity (Eonset: &#8776;0.80&#160;V versus RHE) and selectivity (&#8776;90%) in alkaline conditions compared with conventional Co&#8208;N4 and Ni&#8208;N4 sites. The high H2O2 yield rates of 14.2 and 17.5&#160;moL&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 and long&#8208;term stability over 12&#160;h are respectively achieved for Co&#8208;N3O and Ni&#8208;N3S. Such favorable 2e&#8208;ORR pathway of the catalysts is also theoretically confirmed by the kinetics simulations.

&lt;p&gt;During the generalized coordination engineering strategy, the representative samples Co-N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O and Ni-N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S are precisely synthesized, and both of them present excellent activity and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity (&#8776;90%) compared with conventional Metal-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; configurations.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designing non-noble metal single-atom catalysts (M-SACs) for two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e-ORR) is attractive for the hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) electrosynthesis, in which the coordination configuration of the M-SACs essentially affects the reaction activity and product selectivity.

Herein, a generalized coordination engineering strategy is proposed for M-SACs toward H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrosynthesis via introducing heteroatoms (e.g., oxygen or sulfur atoms) with higher or lower electronegativity than nitrogen atoms into the first sphere of metal-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; system to tailor their electronic structure and adjust the adsorption strength for &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;OOH intermediates, respectively, thus optimizing their electrocatalytic capability for 2e-ORR. Specifically, the (O, N)-coordinated Co SAC (Co-N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O) and (S, N)-coordinated Ni SAC (Ni-N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S) are precisely synthesized, and both present superior 2e-ORR activity (E&lt;sub&gt;onset&lt;/sub&gt;: &#8776;0.80&#160;V versus RHE) and selectivity (&#8776;90%) in alkaline conditions compared with conventional Co-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and Ni-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; sites.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Glass States Generated in a van der Waals Magnet by Alkali&#8208;Ion Intercalation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Na atoms are intercalated into the van der Waals (vdW) gaps of Cr2Ge2Te6 where magnetic frustration is discovered and leads to emerging spin&#8208;glass states coexisting with a ferromagnetic order, confirmed by characteristic signature in ac magnetic susceptibility. This study identifies intercalation as a unique route to generate emerging frustrated spin states in simple vdW crystals.








Abstract
Tuning magnetic properties in layered van der Waals (vdW) materials has captured significant attention due to the efficient control of ground states by heterostructuring and external stimuli. Electron doping by electrostatic gating, interfacial charge transfer, and intercalation is particularly effective in manipulating the exchange and spin&#8208;orbit properties, resulting in a control of Curie temperature (TC) and magnetic anisotropy. Here, an uncharted role of intercalation is discovered to generate magnetic frustration. As a model study, Na atoms are intercalated into the vdW gaps of pristine Cr2Ge2Te6 (CGT) where generated magnetic frustration leads to emerging spin&#8208;glass states coexisting with a ferromagnetic order. A series of dynamic magnetic susceptibility measurements/analysis confirms the formation of magnetic clusters representing slow dynamics with a distribution of relaxation times. The intercalation also modifies other macroscopic physical parameters including the significant enhancement of TC from 66 to 240&#160;K and the switching of magnetic easy&#8208;hard axis direction. This study identifies intercalation as a unique route to generate emerging frustrated spin states in simple vdW crystals.

The development of Alzheimer's disease therapeutics necessitates a precision medicine approach due to its complex pathology. Limited success with antibody treatments underscores the need for broader options such as gene therapy, leveraging discoveries in AD genetic risk. This perspective addresses challenges for precision target and precision delivery and summarizes the essential advanced materials tools, aiming to improve personalized therapy outcomes.








Abstract
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most burdensome aging&#8208;associated neurodegenerative disorder, and its treatment encounters numerous failures during drug development. Although there are newly approved in&#8208;market &#946;&#8208;amyloid targeting antibody solutions, pathological heterogeneity among patient populations still challenges the treatment outcome. Emerging advances in gene therapies offer opportunities for more precise personalized medicine; while, major obstacles including the pathological heterogeneity among patient populations, the puzzled mechanism for druggable target development, and the precision delivery of functional therapeutic elements across the blood&#8211;brain barrier remain and limit the use of gene therapy for central neuronal diseases. Aiming for &#8220;precision delivery&#8221; challenges, nanomedicine provides versatile platforms that may overcome the targeted delivery challenges for AD gene therapy. In this perspective, to picture a toolbox for AD gene therapy strategy development, the most recent advances from benchtop to clinics are highlighted, possibly available gene therapy targets, tools, and delivery platforms are outlined, their challenges as well as rational design elements are addressed, and perspectives in this promising research field are discussed.

         <title>Enthalpy&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Healing in Thin Metallic Films on Flexible Substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metastable thin Mo1&#8208;xAgx films exhibit self&#8208;healing properties. The system can be stabilized by a segregation barrier. Upon cracking, the barrier directs Ag segregations into the cracks instead of to the surface. The effect is autonomously intrinsic, occurs at room temperature, and it is enhanced with increasing temperature. Cracking of thin metal films causes damage to the flexible polymer substrate.









Abstract
Self&#8208;healing microelectronics are needed for costly applications with limited or without access. They are needed in fields such as space exploration to increase lifetime and decrease both costs and the environmental impact. While advanced self&#8208;healing mechanisms for polymers are numerous, practical ways for self&#8208;healing in metal films have yet to be found. A concept for an autonomous intrinsic self&#8208;healing metallic film system is developed, allowing the healing of cracks in metallic films on flexible substrates. The concept relies on stabilizing metastable thin films with high mixing enthalpy via segregation barriers. This allows the films to possess autonomous intrinsic self&#8208;healing capabilities triggered by cracking at temperatures not detrimental to flexible microelectronics. The effect will be shown on metastable Mo1&#8208;xAgx thin films, stabilized via a Mo segregation barrier. Without a segregation barrier, the system is known to exhibit spontaneous Ag particle formation on the surface. This property is controlled and directed to heal cracks and partially restore the electro&#8208;mechanical properties of the multilayer system. This mechanism opens up the field of self&#8208;healing thin metallic films that could profoundly impact the design of future microelectronics.

         <title>Thickness of Nanoscale Poly(Dimethylsiloxane) Layers Determines the Motion of Sliding Water Drops</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polydimethylsiloxane brushes are extensively utilized in material applications as a hydrophobic coating due to the low liquid drop friction and high stability. However, the drop movements still vary depending on how it is prepared. In this work, the film thickness is proved to be a determinant for the water drop dynamic friction on such kind of a surface.








Abstract
Layers of nanometer thick polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) are applied as hydrophobic coatings because of their environmentally friendly and chemically inert properties. In applications such as heat exchangers or fog harvesting, low water drop friction on surfaces is required. While the onset of motion (static friction) has been studied, the knowledge of dynamic friction needs to be improved. To minimize drop friction, it is essential to understand which processes lead to energy dissipation and cause dynamic friction? Here, the dynamic friction of drops on PDMS brushes of different thicknesses is measured, covering the whole available velocity regime. The brush thickness L turns out to be a predictor for drop friction. 4&#8211;5&#160;nm thick PDMS brush shows the lowest dynamic friction. A certain minimal thickness is necessary to form homogeneous surfaces and reduce the attractive van der Waals interaction between water and the substrate. The increase in dynamic friction above L = 5&#160;nm is also attributed to the increasing viscoelastic dissipation of the capillary ridge formed at the contact line. The height of the ridge is related to the brush thickness. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and atomic force measurements support this interpretation. Sum&#8208;frequency generation further indicates a maximum order at the PDMS&#8211;water interface at intermediate thickness.

The increase in dynamic friction above &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt; = 5&#160;nm is also attributed to the increasing viscoelastic dissipation of the capillary ridge formed at the contact line. The height of the ridge is related to the brush thickness. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and atomic force measurements support this interpretation. Sum-frequency generation further indicates a maximum order at the PDMS&#8211;water interface at intermediate thickness.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Scale Tracking Topological Phase Transition Dynamics of Polar Vortex&#8208;Antivortex Pairs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The topological phase transition dynamics of polar vortex&#8208;antivortex (V&#8208;AV) pairs under thermal and electric fields are revealed at the atomic scale using in situ transmission electron microscopy. Upon heating, no dissociation&#8208;like behavior of polar V&#8208;AV pairs is observed, and the antivortex disappears prior to the vortex. Electric fields can facilitate the approach of adjacent vortex and antivortex cores, leading to their annihilation.








Abstract
Non&#8208;trivial topological structures, such as vortex&#8208;antivortex (V&#8208;AV) pairs, have garnered significant attention in the field of condensed matter physics. However, the detailed topological phase transition dynamics of V&#8208;AV pairs, encompassing behaviors like self&#8208;annihilation, motion, and dissociation, have remained elusive in real space. Here, polar V&#8208;AV pairs are employed as a model system, and their transition pathways are tracked with atomic&#8208;scale resolution, facilitated by in situ (scanning) transmission electron microscopy and phase field simulations. This investigation reveals that polar vortices and antivortices can stably coexist as bound pairs at room temperature, and their polarization decreases with heating. No dissociation behavior is observed between the V&#8208;AV phase at room temperature and the paraelectric phase at high temperature. However, the application of electric fields can promote the approach of vortex and antivortex cores, ultimately leading to their annihilation near the interface. Revealing the transition process mediated by polar V&#8208;AV pairs at the atomic scale, particularly the role of polar antivortex, provides new insights into understanding the topological phases of matter and their topological phase transitions. Moreover, the detailed exploration of the dynamics of polar V&#8208;AV pairs under thermal and electrical fields lays a solid foundation for their potential applications in electronic devices.

         <title>Mott&#8211;Schottky Construction Boosted Plasmon Thermal and Electronic Effects on the Ag/CoV&#8208;LDH Nanohybrids for Highly&#8208;Efficient Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mott&#8211;Schottky heterojunction can lower the Fermi level/d&#8208;band center of Ag/CoV&#8208;LDH@G, and strengthen its plasmon effect. The plasmon thermal effect can offset the endothermic enthalpy change of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), promote the deprotonation of *OOH, whereas the electronic effect increases the density of charge carriers, and lowers the activation energy of OER, thereby contributing to remarkable OER and overall&#8208;water&#8208;splitting performances.








Abstract
Mott&#8211;Schottky construction and plasmon excitation represent two highly&#8208;efficient and closely&#8208;linked coping strategies to the high energy loss of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), but the combined effect has rarely been investigated. Herein, with Ag nanoparticles as electronic structure regulator and plasmon exciter, Ag/CoV&#8208;LDH@G nanohybrids (NHs) with Mott&#8211;Schottky heterojunction and notable plasmon effect are well&#8208;designed. Combining theoretical calculations with experiments, it is found that the Mott&#8211;Schottky construction modulates the Fermi level/energy band structure of CoV&#8208;LDH, which in turn leads to lowered d&#8208;band center (from &#8722;0.89 to &#8722;0.93), OER energy barrier (from 6.78 to 1.31&#160;eV), and preeminent plasmon thermal/electronic effects. The thermal effect can offset the endothermic enthalpy change of OER, promote the deprotonation of *OOH, and accelerate electron transfer kinetics. Whereas the electronic effect can increase the density of charge carriers (from 0.70&#160;&#215;&#160;1020 to 1.64&#160;&#215;&#160;1020 cm&#8722;3), lower the activation energy of OER (from 30.3 to 17.7&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1). Benefiting from these favorable factors, the Ag/CoV&#8208;LDH@G NHs show remarkable electrocatalytic performances, with an overpotential of 178 and 263&#160;mV to afford 10 and 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for OER, respectively, and a low cell voltage of 1.42&#160;V to drive 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for overall water splitting under near&#8208;infrared light irradiation.

         <title>Correlating Aggregation Ability of Polymer Donors with Film Formation Kinetics for Organic Solar Cells with Improved Efficiency and Processability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted pyridine units are introduced into D18 to synthesize two terpolymers with modulated aggregation abilities. Earlier phase separation and longer film formation times are achieved and lead to superior blend film morphology, resulting in efficiencies of 19.45%, 13.07%, and 12.43% in small area organic solar cell device, 1 cm2 flexible device, and 43 cm2 module fabricated by slot&#8208;die coating.








Abstract
Film formation kinetics significantly impact molecular processability and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells. Here, two ternary random copolymerization polymers are reported, D18&#9472;N&#8208;p and D18&#9472;N&#8208;m, to modulate the aggregation ability of D18 by introducing trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted pyridine unit at para&#8208; and meta&#8208;positions, respectively. The introduction of pyridine unit significantly reduces material aggregation ability and adjusts the interactions with acceptor L8&#8208;BO, thereby leading to largely changed film formation kinetics with earlier phase separation and longer film formation times, which enlarge fiber sizes in blend films and improve carrier generation and transport. As a result, D18&#9472;N&#8208;p with moderate aggregation ability delivers a high PCE of 18.82% with L8&#8208;BO, which is further improved to 19.45% via interface engineering. Despite the slightly inferior small area device performances, D18&#9472;N&#8208;m shows improved solubility, which inspires to adjust the ratio of meta&#8208;trifluoromethyl pyridine carefully and obtain a polymer donor D18&#9472;N&#8208;m&#8208;10 with good solubility in nonhalogenated solvent o&#8208;xylene. High PCEs of 13.07% and 12.43% in 1 cm2 device and 43 cm2 module fabricated with slot&#8208;die coating method are achieved based on D18&#9472;N&#8208;m&#8208;10:L8&#8208;BO blends. This work emphasizes film formation kinetics optimization in device fabrication via aggregation ability modulation of polymer donors for efficient devices.

         <title>Giant Tunability of Rashba Splitting at Cation&#8208;Exchanged Polar Oxide Interfaces by Selective Orbital Hybridization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unambiguous cation exchange is discovered across the interfaces of (001), (110), and (111) KTaO3 2D electron gases fabricated at room temperature. Remarkably, the (111) interfaces with the highest superconducting transition temperature also turn out to show the strongest electron&#8208;phonon interaction and the largest Rashba spin splitting.








Abstract
The 2D electron gas (2DEG) at oxide interfaces exhibits extraordinary properties, such as 2D superconductivity and ferromagnetism, coupled to strongly correlated electrons in narrow d&#8208;bands. In particular, 2DEGs in KTaO3 (KTO) with 5d t2g orbitals exhibit larger atomic spin&#8208;orbit coupling and crystal&#8208;facet&#8208;dependent superconductivity absent for 3d 2DEGs in SrTiO3 (STO). Herein, by tracing the interfacial chemistry, weak anti&#8208;localization magneto&#8208;transport behavior, and electronic structures of (001), (110), and (111) KTO 2DEGs, unambiguously cation exchange across KTO interfaces is discovered. Therefore, the origin of the 2DEGs at KTO&#8208;based interfaces is dramatically different from the electronic&#160;reconstruction observed at STO interfaces. More importantly, as the interface polarization grows with the higher order planes in the KTO case, the Rashba spin splitting becomes maximal for the superconducting (111) interfaces approximately twice that of the (001) interface. The larger Rashba spin splitting couples strongly to the asymmetric chiral texture of the orbital angular moment, and results mainly from the enhanced inter&#8208;orbital hopping of the t2g bands and more localized wave functions. This finding has profound implications for the search for topological superconductors, as well as the realization of efficient spin&#8208;charge interconversion for low&#8208;power spin&#8208;orbitronics based on (110) and (111) KTO interfaces.

&lt;p&gt;The 2D electron gas (2DEG) at oxide interfaces exhibits extraordinary properties, such as 2D superconductivity and ferromagnetism, coupled to strongly correlated electrons in narrow d-bands. In particular, 2DEGs in KTaO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (KTO) with 5d &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2g&lt;/sub&gt; orbitals exhibit larger atomic spin-orbit coupling and crystal-facet-dependent superconductivity absent for 3d 2DEGs in SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (STO). Herein, by tracing the interfacial chemistry, weak anti-localization magneto-transport behavior, and electronic structures of (001), (110), and (111) KTO 2DEGs, unambiguously cation exchange across KTO interfaces is discovered. Therefore, the origin of the 2DEGs at KTO-based interfaces is dramatically different from the electronic&#160;reconstruction observed at STO interfaces. More importantly, as the interface polarization grows with the higher order planes in the KTO case, the Rashba spin splitting becomes maximal for the superconducting (111) interfaces approximately twice that of the (001) interface. The larger Rashba spin splitting couples strongly to the asymmetric chiral texture of the orbital angular moment, and results mainly from the enhanced inter-orbital hopping of the &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2g&lt;/sub&gt; bands and more localized wave functions. This finding has profound implications for the search for topological superconductors, as well as the realization of efficient spin-charge interconversion for low-power spin-orbitronics based on (110) and (111) KTO interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sterically Hindered Oleogel&#8208;Based Underwater Adhesive Enabled by Mesh&#8208;Tailoring Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing the mesh&#8208;tailoring strategy, bio&#8208;based epoxidized soybean oil (ESO) molecules are precisely entrapped in highly crosslinked polyurethane network, creating a sterically hindered oleogel&#8208;based underwater adhesive (OUA). The well&#8208;designed OUA exhibits facile fabrication, exceptional substrate universality, ultrahigh adhesive strength, remarkable environmental adaptability, excellent stability, and broad application potential.








Abstract
Underwater adhesives hold significant relevance in daily life and numerous industrial applications. Despite considerable efforts, developing scalable, high&#8208;performance underwater adhesives through a simple and effective method remains a formidable challenge. This study presents a novel mesh&#8208;tailoring strategy for in situ, rapid, and ultrastrong oleogel&#8208;based underwater adhesives (OUA), which comprises a highly crosslinked polyurethane network with a matching mesh size (&#8776;2.22&#160;nm) that precisely entraps bio&#8208;based epoxidized soybean oil (ESO) molecules (&#8776;2.31&#160;nm) by steric hindrance effect. This oleogel exhibits unprecedented robust mechanical properties (&#8776;35&#160;MPa) and maintains stability under extreme conditions, including high temperatures (100&#160;&#176;C), high pressures (30&#160;MPa), and immersion in various solvents (water, ethanol, or ESO). In particular, this oleogel displays high hydrophobicity, rapid curing, and strong interface affinity, resulting in ultrahigh underwater adhesion strength (up to 2.13&#160;MPa) and exceptional substrate universality. Moreover, the remarkable environmental adaptability and stability of OUA enable its use in harsh aqueous environments, including acidic/alkaline, saline, and extreme temperature solutions. The comprehensive capabilities of the OUA underscore its potential for building underwater structures, repairing leaky containers, and sealing broken submarine pipelines. This research establishes the foundation for the designing of next&#8208;generation underwater adhesives and offers fresh perspectives for exploring oleogel&#8208;based materials.

         <title>Efficient Large&#8208;Area (81 cm2) Ternary Copper Halides Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with External Quantum Efficiency Exceeding 13% via Host&#8208;Guest Strategy</title>

         <dc:description>
A host&#8208;guest design strategy is adopted to simultaneously improve the exciton radiative recombination and charge injection efficiency in lead&#8208;free [dppb]2Cu2I2 emitters. Consequently, efficient green&#8208;emitting LEDs with a record external quantum efficiency of 13.39% and a large&#8208;area emitting area up to 81 cm2 with uniform emission are realized, substantially surpassing those of recently reported Cu halide&#8208;based devices.








Abstract
Ternary copper (Cu) halides are promising candidates for replacing toxic lead halides in the field of perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) toward practical applications. However, the electroluminescent performance of Cu halide&#8208;based LEDs remains a great challenge due to the presence of serious nonradiative recombination and inefficient charge transport in Cu halide emitters. Here, the rational design of host&#8208;guest [dppb]2Cu2I2 (dppb denotes 1,2&#8208;bis[diphenylphosphino]benzene) emitters and its utility in fabricating efficient Cu halide&#8208;based green LEDs that show a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 13.39% are reported. The host&#8208;guest [dppb]2Cu2I2 emitters with mCP (1,3&#8208;bis(N&#8208;carbazolyl)benzene) host demonstrate a significant improvement of carrier radiative recombination efficiency, with the photoluminescence quantum yield increased by nearly ten times, which is rooted in the efficient energy transfer and type&#8208;I energy level alignment between [dppb]2Cu2I2 and mCP. Moreover, the charge&#8208;transporting mCP host can raise the carrier mobility of [dppb]2Cu2I2 films, thereby enhancing the charge transport and recombination. More importantly, this strategy enables a large&#8208;area prototype LED with a record&#8208;breaking area up to 81 cm2, along with a decent EQE of 10.02% and uniform luminance. It is believed these results represent an encouraging stepping stone to bring Cu halide&#8208;based LEDs from the laboratory toward commercial lighting and display panels.

         <title>Insights into the Mechanism of Chiral&#8208;Induced Spin Selectivity: The Effect of Magnetic Field Direction and Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anisotropy magnetoresistance (AMR) and its temperature dependent are measured, in a crossbar geometry, for chiral oligopeptide monolayers. Periodicity of 360&#176; is observed in the AMR. Quantum simulations reveal that the angular distribution can be simulated only if the monolayer has significant effective spin orbit coupling, which includes contribution from vibrations.








Abstract
Chiral oligopeptide monolayers are adsorbed on a ferromagnetic surface and their magnetoresistance is measured as a function of the angle between the magnetization of the ferromagnet and the surface normal. These measurements are conducted as a function of temperature for both enantiomers. The angle dependence is found to follow a changing trend with a period of&#8197;360&#176;. Quantum simulations reveal that the angular distribution can be obtained only if the monolayer has significant effective spin orbit coupling (SOC), that includes contribution from the vibrations. The model shows that SOC only in the leads cannot reproduce the observed angular dependence. The simulation can reproduce the experiments if it included electron&#8211;phonon interactions and dissipation.

         <title>Completely Inorganic Deep Eutectic Solvents for Efficient and Recyclable Liquid&#8211;Liquid Interface Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A completely inorganic deep eutectic solvent (IDES) is synthesized by ZnCl2 and phosphoric acid through hydrogen bonding (Cl&#183;&#183;&#183;H&#9472;O) and coordination (Zn&#183;&#183;&#183;O&#9552;P). Due to the presence of composite catalytic active site (Zn&#183;&#183;&#183;O&#9552;P), the IDES could convert the oxidant into a triple reactive oxygen species with stronger oxidation ability, leading to rapid and efficient oxidation removal of thiophenes from fuel.








Abstract
Organic acid&#8208;based deep eutectic solvents (DESs) as catalysts always suffer from weak stability and low recyclability due to the accumulation of organic oxidative products in the DES phase. Herein, a completely inorganic deep eutectic solvent (IDES) ZnCl2/PA with zinc chloride (ZnCl2) and phosphoric acid (PA) as precursors is constructed to realize liquid&#8211;liquid interface catalysis for desulfurization of fuel and product self&#8208;separation for the first time. Owing to the inorganic nature, the organic oxidative products are accumulated at the interface between the IDES and fuel rather than the IDES phase. With this unique feature, the IDES can be reused for at least 15 times without any further treatment in oxidative desulfurization process, showing a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art cycle&#8208;regeneration stability. Moreover, compared with the reported organic DESs, the IDES also reveals more attractive catalytic oxidative desulfurization performance. Experimental and theoretical studies indicate that the strong coordination Zn&#183;&#183;&#183;O&#9552;P and the strong adsorption energy between IDES and sulfides enhance the activation of H2O2 to reactive oxygen species, leading to the superior catalytic performance in oxidative desulfurization of fuel.

Experimental and theoretical studies indicate that the strong coordination Zn&#183;&#183;&#183;O&#9552;P and the strong adsorption energy between IDES and sulfides enhance the activation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to reactive oxygen species, leading to the superior catalytic performance in oxidative desulfurization of fuel.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Combination of Counterion Size and Doping Concentration Determines the Electronic and Thermoelectric Properties of Semiconducting Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemically doped organic semiconductors display higher electrical conductivities with larger counterions at low doping concentrations due to decreased Coulomb interactions between counterions and charge carriers. In the high doping regime, the higher dielectric constant allows all charge carriers to be &#8220;free&#8221; regardless of counterion size and morphological disorder dominates the observed electrical conductivity.








Abstract
In both chemical and electrochemical doping of organic semiconductors (OSCs), a counterion, either from the electrolyte or ionized dopant, balances the charge introduced to the OSC. Despite the large influence of this counterion on OSC optical and electronic response, there remains substantial debate on how a fundamental parameter, ion size, impacts these properties. This work resolves much of this debate&#160;by accounting for two doping regimes. In the low&#8208;doping regime, the Coulomb binding energies between charge carriers&#160;on the OSC and the counterions are significant, and larger counterions lead to decreased Coulomb interactions, more delocalized charge carriers, and higher electrical conductivities. In the high&#8208;doping regime, the Coulomb binding energies become negligible due to the increased dielectric constant of the films and a smoothing of the energy landscape; thereby, the electrical conductivities depend primarily on the extent of morphological disorder in the OSC. Moreover, in regioregular poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene), rr&#8208;P3HT, smaller counterions lead to greater bipolaron concentrations in the low&#8208;doping regime due to the increased Coulomb interactions. Emphasizing the impact of the counterion size, it is shown that larger counterions can lead to increased thermoelectric power factors for rr&#8208;P3HT.

         <title>Manipulating Radiation&#8208;Sensitive Z&#8208;DNA Conformation for Enhanced Radiotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The inherent radiosensitivity of tumor DNA represents a breakthrough in sensitization, yet enhancing it remains a challenge. Based on the positive impact of Z&#8208;DNA conformation on its inherent radiosensitivity, a novel radiosensitization strategy is proposed, aiming to enhance radiation&#8208;induced DNA double&#8208;strand breaks (DSBs) by facilitating the B&#8208;Z DNA conformation transition mediated by CBL@HfO2 nanocapsules.









Abstract
DNA double&#8208;strand breaks (DSBs) yield highly determines radiotherapy efficacy. However, improving the inherent radiosensitivity of tumor DNA to promote radiation&#8208;induced DSBs remains a challenge. Using theoretical and experimental models, the underexplored impact of Z&#8208;DNA conformations on radiosensitivity, yielding higher DSBs than other DNA conformations, is discovered. Thereout, a radiosensitization strategy focused on inducing Z&#8208;DNA conformation, utilizing CBL@HfO2 nanocapsules loaded with a Z&#8208;DNA inducer CBL0137, is proposed. A hollow mesoporous HfO2 (HM&#8208;HfO2) acts as a delivery and an energy depositor to promote Z&#8208;DNA breakage. The nanocapsule permits the smart DSBs accelerator that triggers its radiosensitization with irradiation stimulation. Impressively, the CBL@HfO2 facilitates the B&#8208;Z DNA conformational transition, augmenting DSBs about threefold stronger than irradiation alone, generating significant tumor suppression with a 30% cure rate. The approach enables DSBs augmentation by improving the inherent radiosensitivity of DNA. As such, it opens up an era of Z&#8208;DNA conformation manipulation in radiotherapy.

         <title>Tunable and Reversible Adhesive of Liquid Metal Ferrofluid Pillars for Magnetically Actuated Noncontact Transfer Printing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel tunable liquid metal ferrofluid pillars enable efficient magnetically actuated noncontact transfer printing, with gentle contact force and shape adaptability. Rapid stiffness increase and shape change generate an ejection force for receiver&#8208;independent printing, ensuring reliable, damage&#8208;free pickup.








Abstract
Transfer printing techniques based on tunable and reversible adhesives enable the heterogeneous integration of materials in desired layouts and are essential for developing both existing and envisioned electronic systems. Here, a novel tunable and reversible adhesive of liquid metal ferrofluid pillars for developing an efficient magnetically actuated noncontact transfer printing is reported. The liquid metal ferrofluid pillars offer the appealing advantages of gentle contact force by minimizing the preload effect and exceptional shape adaptability by maximizing the interfacial contact area due to their inherent fluidity, thus enabling a reliable damage&#8208;free pickup. Moreover, the liquid metal ferrofluid pillars harness the rapid stiffness increase and shape change with the magnetic field, generating an instantaneous ejection force to achieve a receiver&#8208;independent noncontact printing. Demonstrations of the adhesive of liquid metal ferrofluid pillars in transfer printing of diverse objects with different shapes, materials and dimensions onto various substrates illustrate its great potential in deterministic assembly.

         <title>In Vivo Microrheology Reveals Local Elastic and Plastic Responses Inside 3D Bacterial Biofilms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bacterial biofilms are highly abundant 3D living materials capable of performing complex biomechanical and biochemical functions. A general method is developed to measure internal mechanical properties of biofilms in vivo with spatial resolution on the cellular scale, leading to the discovery that the elastic modulus inside biofilms correlates with the spatial distribution the polysaccharide component of the biofilm matrix.








Abstract
Bacterial biofilms are highly abundant 3D living materials capable of performing complex biomechanical and biochemical functions, including programmable growth, self&#8208;repair, filtration, and bioproduction. Methods to measure internal mechanical properties of biofilms in vivo with spatial resolution on the cellular scale have been lacking. Here, thousands of cells are tracked inside living 3D biofilms of the bacterium Vibrio cholerae during and after the application of shear stress, for a wide range of stress amplitudes, periods, and biofilm sizes, which revealed anisotropic elastic and plastic responses of both cell displacements and cell reorientations. Using cellular tracking to infer parameters of a general mechanical model, spatially&#8208;resolved measurements of the elastic modulus inside the biofilm are obtained, which correlate with the spatial distribution of the polysaccharides within the biofilm matrix. The noninvasive microrheology and force&#8208;inference approach introduced here provides a general framework for studying mechanical properties with high spatial resolution in living materials.

         <title>Constructing Lysozyme Protective Layer via Conformational Transition for Aqueous Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lysozyme protective layer (LPL) with high adhesion and compact morphology is engineered on Zn surface after conformational transition. The conformational transition of lysozyme can expose more functional groups for strong adhesion, high water repel property, and fast ion diffusion kinetics, thus enabling the symmetrical and full Zn batteries with excellent performance under high Zn utilization.








Abstract
The practical applications for aqueous Zn ion batteries (ZIBs) are promising yet still impeded by the severe side reactions on Zn metal. Here, a lysozyme protective layer (LPL) is prepared on Zn metal surface by a simple and facile self&#8208;adsorption strategy. The LPL exhibits extremely strong adhesion on Zn metal to provide stable interface during long&#8208;term cycling. In addition, the self&#8208;adsorption strategy triggered by the hydrophobicity&#8208;induced aggregation effect endows the protective layer with a gap&#8208;free and compacted morphology which can reject free water for effective side reaction inhibition performance. More importantly, the lysozyme conformation is transformed from &#945;&#8208;helix to &#946;&#8208;sheet structure before layer formation, thus abundant functional groups are exposed to interact with Zn2+ for electrical double layer (EDL) modification, desolvation energy decrease, and ion diffusion kinetics acceleration. Consequently, the LPL renders the symmetrical Zn battery with ultra&#8208;long cycling performance for more than 1200 h under high Zn depth of discharge (DOD) for 77.7%, and the Zn/Zn0.25V2O5 pouch cell with low N/P ratio of 2.1 at high Zn utilization of 48% for over 300 cycles. This study proposes a facile and low&#8208;cost method for constructing a stable protective layer of Zn metal for high Zn utilization aqueous devices.

The conformational transition of lysozyme can expose more functional groups for strong adhesion, high water repel property, and fast ion diffusion kinetics, thus enabling the symmetrical and full Zn batteries with excellent performance under high Zn utilization.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practical applications for aqueous Zn ion batteries (ZIBs) are promising yet still impeded by the severe side reactions on Zn metal. Here, a lysozyme protective layer (LPL) is prepared on Zn metal surface by a simple and facile self-adsorption strategy. The LPL exhibits extremely strong adhesion on Zn metal to provide stable interface during long-term cycling. In addition, the self-adsorption strategy triggered by the hydrophobicity-induced aggregation effect endows the protective layer with a gap-free and compacted morphology which can reject free water for effective side reaction inhibition performance. More importantly, the lysozyme conformation is transformed from &#945;-helix to &#946;-sheet structure before layer formation, thus abundant functional groups are exposed to interact with Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; for electrical double layer (EDL) modification, desolvation energy decrease, and ion diffusion kinetics acceleration. Consequently, the LPL renders the symmetrical Zn battery with ultra-long cycling performance for more than 1200 h under high Zn depth of discharge (DOD) for 77.7%, and the Zn/Zn&lt;sub&gt;0.25&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; pouch cell with low N/P ratio of 2.1 at high Zn utilization of 48% for over 300 cycles. This study proposes a facile and low-cost method for constructing a stable protective layer of Zn metal for high Zn utilization aqueous devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Herein, van der Waals Schottky&#8208;gated MoS2 metal&#8211;semiconductor field&#8208;effect transistors are developed, mitigating two primary sources of Fermi&#8208;level pinning&#8212;metal&#8208;induced gap states and disorder&#8208;induced gap states. Consequently, the devices exhibit ideal hysteresis&#8208;free transistor characteristics with a subthreshold swing of 60&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1 at 300&#160;K, approaching to&#160;the fundamental Boltzmann switching limit.








Abstract
A gate stack that facilitates a high&#8208;quality interface and tight electrostatic control is crucial for realizing high&#8208;performance and low&#8208;power field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs). However, when constructing conventional metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor structures with two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenide channels, achieving these requirements becomes challenging due to inherent difficulties in obtaining high&#8208;quality gate dielectrics through native oxidation or film deposition. Here, a gate&#8208;dielectric&#8208;less device architecture of van der Waals Schottky gated metal&#8211;semiconductor FETs (vdW&#8208;SG MESFETs) using a molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) channel and surface&#8208;oxidized metal gates such as nickel and copper is reported. Benefiting from the strong SG coupling, these MESFETs operate at remarkably low gate voltages, &lt;0.5&#160;V. Notably, they also exhibit Boltzmann&#8208;limited switching behavior featured by a subthreshold swing of &#8776;60&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1 and negligible hysteresis. These ideal FET characteristics are attributed to the formation of a Fermi&#8208;level (EF) pinning&#8208;free gate stack at the Schottky&#8211;Mott limit. Furthermore, authors experimentally and theoretically confirm that EF depinning can be achieved by suppressing both metal&#8208;induced and disorder&#8208;induced gap states at the interface between the monolithic&#8208;oxide&#8208;gapped metal gate and the MoS2 channel. This work paves a new route for designing high&#8208;performance and energy&#8208;efficient 2D electronics.

         <title>A Lead&#8208;Free Ferroelectric 2D Dion&#8211;Jacobson Tin Iodide Perovskite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
New lead&#8208;free 2D Dion&#8211;Jacobson tin perovskites containing the 4&#8208;(aminomethyl)piperidinium (4AMP) spacer cation are studied: (4AMP)SnI4, (4AMP)(MA)Sn2I7, and (4AMP)(FA)Sn2I7 (MA = methylammonium, FA = formamidinium). Structural analysis reveals that only (4AMP)SnI4 is noncentrosymmetric, confirmed by second harmonic generation. Ferroelectric hysteresis measurements provide clear evidence of ferroelectricity of (4AMP)SnI4 at room temperature with spontaneous polarization of 10.0 &#181;C cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
2D hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic halide perovskites emerge as a new class of 2D semiconductors with the potential to combine excellent optoelectronic properties with symmetry&#8208;enabled properties such as ferroelectricity. Although many lead&#8208;based ferroelectric 2D halide perovskites are reported, there is yet to be a conclusive report of ferroelectricity in tin&#8208;based 2D perovskites. Here, the structures and properties of a new series of 2D Dion&#8211;Jacobson (DJ) Sn perovskites: (4AMP)SnI4, (4AMP)(MA)Sn2I7, and (4AMP)(FA)Sn2I7 (4AMP = 4&#8208;(aminomethyl)piperidinium, MA = methylammonium, and FA = formamidinium), are reported. Structural characterization reveals that (4AMP)SnI4 is polar with in&#8208;plane spontaneous polarization whereas (4AMP)(MA)Sn2I7 and (4AMP)(FA)Sn2I7 are centrosymmetric. Further, (4AMP)SnI4 displays second harmonic generation (SHG) and polarization&#8208;electric field hysteresis measurements confirm it is ferroelectric with a spontaneous polarization of 10.0 &#181;C cm&#8722;2 at room temperature. (4AMP)SnI4 transitions into a centrosymmetric structure above 367 K. As the first direct experimental observation of the spontaneous ferroelectric polarization of a Sn&#8208;based 2D hybrid perovskite, this work opens up environmentally friendly 2D tin halide perovskites for ferroelectricity and other physical property studies.

         <title>A Large&#8208;Scale Fabrication of Flexible, Ultrathin, and Robust Solid Electrolyte for Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>

A feasible and scalable approach to construct 3D supporting skeleton using an electro&#8208;blown spinning technique for the preparation of thin solid electrolytes is proposed. This skeleton not only enhances the mechanical strength but also hinders the migration of Li&#8208;salt anions, providing a homogeneous distribution of Li&#8208;ion flux and local current density, which contributes to a uniform Li deposition.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (ASSLMBs) are considered as the most promising candidates for the next&#8208;generation high&#8208;safety batteries. To achieve high energy density in ASSLMBs, it is essential that the solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) are lightweight, thin, and possess superior electrochemical stability. In this study, a feasible and scalable fabrication approach to construct 3D supporting skeleton using an electro&#8208;blown spinning technique is proposed. This skeleton not only enhances the mechanical strength but also hinders the migration of Li&#8208;salt anions, improving the lithium&#8208;ion transference number of the SSE. This provides a homogeneous distribution of Li&#8208;ion flux and local current density, promoting uniform Li deposition. As a result, based on the mechanically robust and thin SSEs, the Li symmetric cells show outstanding Li plating/stripping reversibility. Besides, a stable&#160;interface&#160;contact between SSE and Li anode has been established with the formation of an F&#8208;enriched solid electrolyte interface layer. The solid&#8208;state Li|sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (Li|SPAN) cell achieves a capacity retention ratio of 94.0% after 350 cycles at 0.5 C. Also, the high&#8208;voltage Li|LCO cell shows a capacity retention of 92.4% at 0.5 C after 500 cycles. This fabrication approach for SSEs is applicable for commercially large&#8208;scale production and application in high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and high&#8208;safety ASSLMBs.

         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates the observation of ultrahigh photoconductivity in DNA&#8208;MoS2 nano&#8208;biocomposite film. This is achieved by utilizing DNA&#8208;MoS2 hydrogel formation by incorporating a MoS2 network in the ss&#8208;DNA matrix. Ultra&#8208;high photocurrent (5.5 mA at 1 V) with a record&#8208;high on/off ratio (1.3 &#215; 106) is observed, five orders of magnitude higher than conventional biomaterials (&#8776;101) reported so far.








Abstract
A nano&#8208;biocomposite film with ultrahigh photoconductivity remains elusive and critical for bio&#8208;optoelectronic applications. A uniform, well&#8208;connected, high&#8208;concentration nanomaterial network in the biological matrix remains challenging to achieve high photoconductivity. Wafer&#8208;scale continuous nano&#8208;biocomposite film without surface deformations and cracks plays another major obstacle. Here ultrahigh photoconductivity is observed in deoxyribonucleic acid&#8208;molybdenum disulfide (DNA&#8208;MoS2) nano&#8208;biocomposite film by incorporating a high&#8208;concentration, well&#8208;percolated, and uniform MoS2 network in the ss&#8208;DNA matrix. This is achieved by utilizing DNA&#8208;MoS2 hydrogel formation, which results in crack&#8208;free, wafer&#8208;scale DNA&#8208;MoS2 nano&#8208;biocomposite films. Ultra&#8208;high photocurrent (5.5&#160;mA at 1&#160;V) with a record&#8208;high on/off ratio (1.3 &#215; 106) is observed, five orders of magnitude higher than conventional biomaterials (&#8776;101) reported so far. The incorporation of the Wely semimetal (Bismuth) as an electrical contact exhibits ultrahigh photoresponsivity (2.6 &#215; 105 A W&#8722;1). Such high photoconductivity in DNA&#8208;MoS2 nano&#8208;biocomposite could bridge the gap between biology, electronics, and optics for innovative biomedicine, bioengineering, and neuroscience applications.

         <title>Activating Iterative Revolutions of the Cancer&#8208;Immunity Cycle in Hypoxic Tumors with a Smart Nano&#8208;Regulator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a smart nano&#8208;regulator (PNBJQ) with hypoxic tolerance and tumor&#8208;selectivity. PNBJQ focuses on targeting two nonredundant immune nodes encompassing the induction of immunogenic cancer cell death and the abrogation of immune resistance. This precise modulation activates the iterative revolution of cancer&#8208;immune cycle, resulting in a remarkable suppression of bilateral tumors under low light dose irradiation without side effects.








Abstract
The activation of sequential events in the cancer&#8208;immunity cycle (CIC) is crucial for achieving effective antitumor immunity. However, formidable challenges, such as innate and adaptive immune resistance, along with the off&#8208;target adverse effects of nonselective immunomodulators, persist. In this study, a tumor&#8208;selective nano&#8208;regulator named PNBJQ has been presented, focusing on targeting two nonredundant immune nodes: inducing immunogenic cancer cell death and abrogating immune resistance to fully activate endogenous tumor immunity. PNBJQ is obtained by encapsulating the immunomodulating agent JQ1 within a self&#8208;assembling system formed by linking a Type&#8208;I photosensitizer to polyethylene glycol through a hypoxia&#8208;sensitive azo bond. Benefiting from the Type&#8208;I photosensitive mechanism, PNBJQ triggers the immunogenic cell death of hypoxic tumors under near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#160;light irradiation. This process resolves innate immune resistance by stimulating sufficient cytotoxic T&#8208;lymphocytes. Simultaneously, PNBJQ smartly responds to the hypoxic tumor microenvironment for precise drug delivery, adeptly addressing adaptive immune resistance by using JQ1 to downregulate programmed death ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) and sustaining the response of cytotoxic T lymphocytes. The activatable synergic photoimmunotherapy promotes an immune&#8208;promoting tumor microenvironment by activating an iterative revolution of the CIC, which remarkably eradicates established hypoxic tumors and suppresses distal lesions under low light dose irradiation.

         <title>Prestrain Guided Yield of Large Single&#8208;Crystal Nickel Foils with High&#8208;Index Facets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large single&#8208;crystal nickel foils with high&#8208;index facets, the largest one of which exceeds 5&#215;8 cm2 in size, are successfully produced through prestrain energy engineering technique, in which the strain energy drives the single crystal conversion. High&#8208;quality graphite films are synthesized on the single&#8208;crystal Ni(012) foils, and the graphite/Ni(012) foil composites exhibit enhanced thermal conductivity compared to polycrystalline nickel foil.








Abstract
Single&#8208;crystal metal foils with high&#8208;index facets are currently being investigated owing to their potential application in the epitaxial growth of high&#8208;quality van der Waals film materials, electrochemical catalysis, gas sensing, and other fields. However, the controllable synthesis of large single&#8208;crystal metal foils with high&#8208;index facets remains a great challenge because high&#8208;index facets with high surface energy are not preferentially formed thermodynamically and kinetically. Herein, single&#8208;crystal nickel foils with a series of high&#8208;index facets are efficiently prepared by applying prestrain energy engineering technique, with the largest single&#8208;crystal foil exceeding 5&#215;8 cm2 in size. In terms of thermodynamics, the internal mechanism of prestrain regulation on the formation of high&#8208;index facets is proposed. Molecular dynamics simulation is utilized to replicate and explain the phenomenon of multiple crystallographic orientations resulting from prestrain regulation. Additionally, large&#8208;sized and high&#8208;quality graphite films are successfully fabricated on single&#8208;crystal Ni(012) foils. Compared to the polycrystalline nickel, the graphite/single&#8208;crystal Ni(012) foil composites show more than five&#8208;fold increase in thermal conductivity, thereby showing great potential applications in thermal management. This study hence presents a novel approach for the preparation of single&#8208;crystal nickel foils with high&#8208;index facets, which is beneficial for the epitaxial growth of certain two&#8208;dimensional&#160;materials.

         <title>&#8220;Cloth&#8208;to&#8208;Clothes&#8208;Like&#8221; Fabrication of Soft Actuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;cloth&#8208;to&#8208;clothes&#8208;like&#8221; method is proposed to prepare soft actuators (&#8220;clothes&#8221;) by combining the hysteretic behavior of liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) (&#8220;cloth&#8221;) with exchange reactions of dynamic covalent bonds. &#8220;Cloth&#8221; retains targeted shapes after deformation and naturally becomes &#8220;clothes&#8221; at ambient temperatures. This strategy significantly lowers the threshold of customizing soft actuators, promising to realize mass production and universal applications.








Abstract
Inspired by adaptive natural organisms and living matter, soft actuators appeal to a variety of innovative applications such as soft grippers, artificial muscles, wearable electronics, and biomedical devices. However, their fabrication is typically limited in laboratories or a few enterprises since specific instruments, strong stimuli, or specialized operation skills are inevitably involved. Here a straightforward &#8220;cloth&#8208;to&#8208;clothes&#8208;like&#8221; method to prepare soft actuators with a low threshold by combining the hysteretic behavior of liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) with the exchange reaction of dynamic covalent bonds, is proposed. Due to the hysteretic behavior, the LCEs (resemble &#8220;cloth&#8221;) effectively retain predefined shapes after stretching and releasing for extended periods. Subsequently, the samples naturally become soft actuators (resemble &#8220;clothes&#8221;) via the exchange reaction at ambient temperatures. As a post&#8208;synthesis method, this strategy effectively separates the production of LCEs and soft actuators. LCEs can be mass&#8208;produced in bulk by factories or producers and stored as prepared, much like rolls of cloth. When required, these LCEs can be customized into soft actuators as needed. This strategy provides a robust, flexible, and scalable solution to engineer soft actuators, holding great promise for mass production and universal applications.

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Tailored Ionizable Lipid Nanoparticles Facilitate IL&#8208;12 Circular RNA Delivery for Enhanced Lung Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops a new lipid nanoparticle (LNP) that efficiently delivers circular RNA to lung tumors. The LNP shows better circRNA delivery efficiency than the benchmark. A single dose of this interleukin&#8208;12 circRNA&#8208;LNP induces robust anti&#8208;tumor immunity and tumor regression in two lung cancer models. This tailored LNP platform holds promise for advancing RNA immunotherapies against lung cancer.








Abstract
The advancement of message RNA (mRNA) &#8208;based immunotherapies for cancer is highly dependent on the effective delivery of RNA (Ribonucleic) payloads using ionizable lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). However, the clinical application of these therapies is hindered by variable mRNA expression among different cancer types and the risk of systemic toxicity. The transient expression profile of mRNA further complicates this issue, necessitating frequent dosing and thus increasing the potential for adverse effects. Addressing these challenges, a high&#8208;throughput combinatorial method is utilized to synthesize and screen LNPs that efficiently deliver circular RNA (circRNA) to lung tumors. The lead LNP, H1L1A1B3, demonstrates a fourfold increase in circRNA transfection efficiency in lung cancer cells over ALC&#8208;0315, the industry&#8208;standard LNPs, while providing potent immune activation. A single intratumoral injection of H1L1A1B3 LNPs, loaded with circRNA encoding interleukin&#8208;12 (IL&#8208;12), induces a robust immune response in a Lewis lung carcinoma model, leading to marked tumor regression. Immunological profiling of treated tumors reveals substantial increments in CD45+ leukocytes and enhances infiltration of CD8+ T cells, underscoring the ability of H1L1A1B3 LNPs to modulate the tumor microenvironment favorably. These results highlight the potential of tailored LNP platforms to advance RNA drug delivery for cancer therapy, broadening the prospects for RNA immunotherapeutics.

&lt;p&gt;This study develops a new lipid nanoparticle (LNP) that efficiently delivers circular RNA to lung tumors. The LNP shows better circRNA delivery efficiency than the benchmark. A single dose of this interleukin-12 circRNA-LNP induces robust anti-tumor immunity and tumor regression in two lung cancer models. This tailored LNP platform holds promise for advancing RNA immunotherapies against lung cancer.

         <title>Deterministic Fabrication and Quantum&#8208;Well Modulation of Phase&#8208;Pure 2D Perovskite Heterostructures for Encrypted Light Communication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deterministic integration of phase&#8208;pure 2D perovskite nanosheets leads to novel dual&#8208;peak emission phenomenon and dual&#8208;band photoresponse characteristic modulated by comprising quantum wells. By combining the modulated dual&#8208;band photoresponse with the double&#8208;beam irradiation mode and the encryption algorithm, secure light communication system is constructed to explore the potential of heterostructure&#8208;based PDs in advanced functional optoelectronic fields.








Abstract
Deterministic integration of phase&#8208;pure Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) perovskites has great significance for realizing functional optoelectronic devices. However, precise fabrications of artificial perovskite heterostructures with pristine interfaces and rational design over electronic structure configurations remain a challenge. Here, the controllable synthesis of large&#8208;area ultrathin single&#8208;crystalline RP perovskite nanosheets and the deterministic fabrication of arbitrary 2D vertical perovskite heterostructures are reported. The 2D heterostructures exhibit intriguing dual&#8208;peak emission phenomenon and dual&#8208;band photoresponse characteristic. Importantly, the interlayer energy transfer behaviors from wide&#8208;bandgap component to narrow&#8208;bandgap component modulated by comprising quantum wells are thoroughly revealed. Functional nanoscale photodetectors are further constructed based on the 2D heterostructures. Moreover, by combining the modulated dual&#8208;band photoresponse characteristic with double&#8208;beam irradiation modes, and introducing an encryption algorithm mechanism, a light communication system with high security and reliability is achieved. This work can greatly promote the development of heterogeneous integration technologies of 2D perovskites, and could provide a competitive candidate for advanced integrated optoelectronics.

         <title>A Temperature Self&#8208;Adaptive Electrolyte for Wide&#8208;Temperature Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study elucidates the failure mechanisms of zinc anodes in aqueous electrolytes under high&#8208; and low&#8208;temperature conditions. By manipulating the competitive relationship between solvents and anions in the electrolyte, a temperature self&#8208;adaptive electrolyte is devised and fabricated to enable the superior operation of zinc anodes within the temperature range of &#8722;35 to 75&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
The advancement of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) is often hampered by the dendritic zinc growth and the parasitic side reactions between the zinc anode and the aqueous electrolyte, especially under extreme temperature conditions. This study unveils the performance decay mechanism of zinc anodes in harsh environments, characterized by &#8220;dead zinc&#8221; at low temperatures and aggravated hydrogen evolution and adverse by&#8208;products at elevated temperatures. To address these issues, a temperature self&#8208;adaptive electrolyte (TSAE), founded on the competitive coordination principle of co&#8208;solvent and anions, is introduced. This electrolyte exhibits a dynamic solvation capability, engendering an inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interface (SEI) at low temperatures while an organic alkyl ether&#8208; and alkyl carbonate&#8208;containing SEI at elevated temperatures. The self&#8208;adaptability of the electrolyte significantly enhances the performance of the zinc anode across a broad temperature range. A Zn//Zn symmetrical cell, based on the TSAE, showcases reversible plating/stripping exceeding 16&#160;800 h (&gt;700 d) at room temperature under 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 1 mAh cm&#8722;2, setting a record of lifespan. Furthermore, the TSAE enables stable operation of the zinc full batteries across an ultrawide temperature range of &#8722;35 to 75&#160;&#176;C. This work illuminates a pathway for optimizing AZIBs under extreme temperatures by fine&#8208;tuning the interfacial chemistry.

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Dependent Superconductivity in Topological Dirac Semimetal SrCuBi</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superconductivity of topological Dirac semimetal (TDS) SrCuBi with planar honeycomb layer structure is reported. The surface superconductivity at the edge of SrCuBi TDS is induced by the symmetry breaking of the honeycomb layered structure. High pressure enhances the superconducting transition temperature up to 4.8 K under 6.2&#160;GPa, where the non&#8208;s&#8208;wave unconventional superconductivity emerges.








Abstract
The discovery of superconducting states in diverse topological materials generates a burgeoning interest to explore a topological superconductor and to realize a fault&#8208;tolerant topological quantum computation. A variety of routes to realize topological superconductors are proposed, and many types of topological materials are developed. However, a pristine topological material with a natural superconducting state is relatively rare as compared to topological materials with artificially induced superconductivity. Here, it is reported that the planar honeycomb structured 3D topological Dirac semimetal (TDS) SrCuBi, which is the Zintl phase, shows a natural surface superconductivity at 2.1 K under ambient pressure. It is clearly identified from theoretical calculations that a topologically nontrivial state exists on the (100) surface. Further, its superconducting transition temperature (Tc) increases by applying pressure, exhibiting a maximal Tc of 4.8 K under 6.2&#160;GPa. It is believed that this discovery opens up a new possibility of exploring exotic Majorana fermions at the surface of 3D TDS superconductors.

         <title>Uniaxial&#8208;Oriented Chiral Perovskite for Flexible Full&#8208;Stokes Polarimeter</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pioneering flexible full&#8208;Stokes polarimeter is developed and fabricated using a uniaxial&#8208;oriented chiral perovskite film. This achievement is a result of regulating fluid dynamics, specifically involving the control of the Marangoni effect during the blade coating process. The fabricated polarimeter demonstrates precise full&#8208;Stokes polarization detection, high&#8208;performance photoresponse, matrix polarization imaging capability, and superior mechanical durability.








Abstract
Full&#8208;Stokes polarization detection, with high integration and portability, offers an efficient path toward next&#8208;gen multi&#8208;information optoelectronic systems. Nevertheless, current techniques relying on optical filters create rigid and bulky configurations, limiting practicality. Here, a flexible, filter&#8208;less full&#8208;Stokes polarimeter featuring a uniaxial&#8208;oriented chiral perovskite film is first reported. It is found that, the strategic manipulation of the surfactant&#8208;mediated Marangoni effect during blade coating, is crucial for guiding an equilibrious mass transport to achieve oriented crystallization. Through this approach, the obtained uniaxial&#8208;oriented chiral perovskite films inherently possess anisotropy and chirality, and thereby with desired sensitivity to both linearly polarized light and circularly polarized light vectors. The uniaxial&#8208;oriented crystalline structure also improves photodetection, achieving a specific detectivity of 5.23&#160;&#215;&#160;1013&#160;Jones, surpassing non&#8208;oriented devices by 10&#215;. The as&#8208;fabricated flexible polarimeters enable accurate capture of full&#8208;Stokes polarization without optical filters, exhibiting slight detection errors for the Stokes parameters: &#916;S1&#160;=&#160;9.2%, &#916;S2&#160;=&#160;8.6%, and &#916;S3&#160;=&#160;6.5%, approaching the detection accuracy of optics&#8208;filter polarimeters. This proof of concept also demonstrates applications in matrix polarization imaging.

The uniaxial-oriented crystalline structure also improves photodetection, achieving a specific detectivity of 5.23&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;Jones, surpassing non-oriented devices by 10&#215;. The as-fabricated flexible polarimeters enable accurate capture of full-Stokes polarization without optical filters, exhibiting slight detection errors for the Stokes parameters: &#916;&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1&#160;&lt;/sub&gt;=&#160;9.2%, &#916;&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&#160;&lt;/sub&gt;=&#160;8.6%, and &#916;&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;3&#160;&lt;/sub&gt;=&#160;6.5%, approaching the detection accuracy of optics-filter polarimeters. This proof of concept also demonstrates applications in matrix polarization imaging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Targeted Novel Temozolomide Nanocapsules Encapsulating siPKM2 Inhibit Aerobic Glycolysis to Sensitize Glioblastoma to Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a TMZ nanocapsule delivery system (ApoE&#8208;MT/siPKM2 NC) with dual&#8208;targeting of blood&#8211;brain barrier and glioblastoma, codelivering TMZ and siPKM2, is successfully designed and synthesized. This nanocapsule can cleavage and release in high glutathione environment and enhance the chemosensitivity of glioblastoma to TMZ by inhibiting the aerobic glycolytic energy metabolism pathway, and achieve a starvation&#8208;chemotherapy strategy for glioblastoma.








Abstract
Chemotherapy of glioblastoma (GBM) has not yielded success due to inefficient blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) penetration and poor glioma tissue accumulation. Aerobic glycolysis, as the main mode of energy supply for GBM, safeguards the rapid growth of GBM while affecting the efficacy of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Therefore, to effectively inhibit aerobic glycolysis, increase drug delivery efficiency and sensitivity, a novel temozolomide (TMZ) nanocapsule (ApoE&#8208;MT/siPKM2 NC) is successfully designed and prepared for the combined delivery of pyruvate kinase M2 siRNA (siPKM2) and TMZ. This drug delivery platform uses siPKM2 as the inner core and methacrylate&#8208;TMZ (MT) as the shell component to achieve inhibition of glioma energy metabolism while enhancing the killing effect of TMZ. By modifying apolipoprotein E (ApoE), dual targeting of the BBB and GBM is achieved in a &#8220;two birds with one stone&#8221; style. The glutathione (GSH) responsive crosslinker containing disulfide bonds ensures &#8220;directional blasting&#8221; cleavage of the nanocapsules to release MT and siPKM2 in the high GSH environment of glioma cells. In addition, in vivo experiments verify that ApoE&#8208;MT/siPKM2 NC has good targeting ability and prolongs the survival of tumor&#8208;bearing nude mice. In summary, this drug delivery system provides a new strategy for metabolic therapy sensitization chemotherapy.

         <title>Peptide&#8208;AIE Nanofibers Functionalized Sutures with Antimicrobial Activity and Subcutaneous Traceability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorescent&#8208;traceable antimicrobial suture is developed involving peptide&#8208;AIE nanofibers. The suture demonstrates robust fluorescence and antimicrobial activity, along with excellent hemocompatibility and biocompatibility. In skin wound and abdominal wall wound models, it effectively prevents MRSA infection and enhances healing, surpassing the performance of the commercial Coated VICRYL Plus Antibacterial suture. Furthermore, it displays subcutaneous traceability, enabling real&#8208;time monitoring of degradation.








Abstract
As one of the most widely used medical devices, sutures face challenges related to surgical site infections (SSIs) and lack of subcutaneous traceability. In the present study, a facile and effective approach using peptide&#8208;AIE nanofibers (NFs&#8208;K18) to create fluorescent&#8208;traceable antimicrobial sutures, which have been applied to four commercially available sutures is developed. The functionalized sutures of PGAS&#8208;NFs&#8208;K18 and PGLAS&#8208;NFs&#8208;K18 exhibit fluorescence with excellent penetration from 4&#160;mm chicken breasts. They also demonstrate remarkable stability after 24&#160;h of white light illumination and threading through chicken breasts 10 times. These sutures efficiently generate ROS, resulting in significant suppression of four clinical bacteria, with the highest antimicrobial rate of &#8776;100%. Moreover, the sutures exhibit favorable hemocompatibility and biocompatibility. In vivo experiments demonstrate that the optimized PGLAS&#8208;NFs&#8208;K18 suture displays potent antimicrobial activity against MRSA, effectively inhibiting inflammation and promoting tissue healing in both skin wound and abdominal wall wound models, outperforming the commercially available Coated VICRYL Plus Antibacterial suture. Importantly, PGLAS&#8208;NFs&#8208;K18 exhibits sensitive subcutaneous traceability, allowing for accurate in situ monitoring of its degradation. It is believed that this straightforward strategy offers a new pathway for inhibiting SSIs and monitoring the status of sutures.

         <title>Terahertz and Infrared Plasmon Polaritons in PtTe2 Type&#8208;II Dirac Topological Semimetal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, the optical response of platinum ditelluride (PtTe2), a type II Dirac topological semimetals grown on Si&#8208;based substrates, is investigated in the terahertz&#160;&#8208; infrared spectral range. Surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) generated on microscale ribbon arrays of PtTe2 are detected in the far&#8208;field limit, finding an excellent agreement among experimental measurements, theoretical models, and electromagnetic simulation.








Abstract
Surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) are electromagnetic excitations existing at the interface between a metal and a dielectric. SPPs provide a promising path in nanophotonic devices&#160;for&#160;light manipulation at the micro and nanoscale with applications in optoelectronics, biomedicine, and energy harvesting. Recently, SPPs are extended to unconventional materials like graphene, transparent oxides, superconductors, and topological systems characterized by linearly dispersive electronic bands. In this respect, 3D Dirac and Weyl semimetals offer a promising frontier for infrared (IR) and terahertz (THz) radiation tuning by topologically&#8208;protected SPPs.&#160;In this work, the THz&#8208;IR optical response of platinum ditelluride (PtTe2) type&#8208;II Dirac topological semimetal films grown on Si substrates is investigated. SPPs generated on microscale ribbon arrays of PtTe2&#160;are detected in the far&#8208;field limit,&#160;finding an excellent agreement among measurements, theoretical models, and electromagnetic simulation data.&#160;The far&#8208;field measurements are further supported by near&#8208;field IR data which indicate a strong electric field enhancement due to the SPP excitation near the ribbon edges. The present findings indicate that the PtTe2&#160;ribbon array appears an ideal&#160;active layout for geometrically tunable SPPs thus inspiring a new fashion of optically tunable materials in the technologically demanding THz and IR spectrum.

         <title>Efficient Perovskite Nanograin Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes in Green&#8208;to&#8208;Blue Gamut with Co&#8208;Additive Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient perovskite nanograin light&#8208;emitting diodes, presenting champion external quantum efficiencies (EQE) of 28.4%, 24.4%, 21.6%, 17.5%, and 11.1% at 521, 496, 488, 478, and 472&#160;nm, respectively, along with a narrow spectral linewidth (17.5&#8211;14&#160;nm) and stable color, are reported. The performances compare favorably with or exceed those of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art devices ever reported.








Abstract
Perovskite nanograins exceeding the Bohr exciton diameter show great potential for high&#8208;performance light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) owing to their bandgap homogeneity, spatial charge confinement, and nonlocal interaction. However, it is challenging to directly synthesize proper nanograins along with reduced crystal defects on functional substrate, and the corresponding high&#8208;efficiency perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs) have rarely been reported. In this study, crystallization modulation for perovskites with an effective co&#8208;additive system, including lithium bromide, p&#8208;fluorophenethylammonium bromide, and 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6, is performed. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the proposed co&#8208;additive system can synergistically retard perovskite crystallization and reduce crystal defects. Consequently, high&#8208;quality perovskite nanograin solids (&#8776;22.8&#160;nm) are obtained with a high photoluminescence quantum yield (&#8776;88%). These superior optical properties contribute to developing efficient green PeLEDs with a champion external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 28.4% and an average EQE of 27.1%. The co&#8208;additive system can be universally applied to mixed&#8208;halide perovskite nanograin LED, presenting a maximum EQE of 24.4%, 21.6%, 17.5%, and 11.1% for the blue device at 496, 488, 478, and 472&#160;nm, respectively, along with a narrow spectral linewidth (17&#8211;14&#160;nm) and stable color. These results supplement the research on high&#8208;efficiency perovskite nanograin LEDs for multicolor displays and lighting.

In this study, crystallization modulation for perovskites with an effective co-additive system, including lithium bromide, &lt;i&gt;p-&lt;/i&gt;fluorophenethylammonium bromide, and 18-crown-6, is performed. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the proposed co-additive system can synergistically retard perovskite crystallization and reduce crystal defects. Consequently, high-quality perovskite nanograin solids (&#8776;22.8&#160;nm) are obtained with a high photoluminescence quantum yield (&#8776;88%). These superior optical properties contribute to developing efficient green PeLEDs with a champion external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 28.4% and an average EQE of 27.1%. The co-additive system can be universally applied to mixed-halide perovskite nanograin LED, presenting a maximum EQE of 24.4%, 21.6%, 17.5%, and 11.1% for the blue device at 496, 488, 478, and 472&#160;nm, respectively, along with a narrow spectral linewidth (17&#8211;14&#160;nm) and stable color. These results supplement the research on high-efficiency perovskite nanograin LEDs for multicolor displays and lighting.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Autonomous Artificial Olfactory Sensor Systems with Homeostasis Recovery via a Seamless Neuromorphic Architecture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial olfactory sensor system capable of detecting gas accumulation via memory characteristics is investigated, all in a seamless architecture. The neuromorphic olfactory system exhibits excitatory action in response to NO2 gas, triggering an alarm at dangerous levels of gas adsorption. Furthermore, inhibitory properties from pulsed UV light are analyzed, demonstrating autonomous recovery that mimic the biological homeostasis function.








Abstract
Neuromorphic olfactory systems have been actively studied in recent years owing to their considerable potential in electronic noses, robotics, and neuromorphic data processing systems. However, conventional gas sensors typically have the ability to detect hazardous gas levels but lack synaptic functions such as memory and recognition of gas accumulation, which are essential for realizing human&#8208;like neuromorphic sensory system. In this study, a seamless architecture for a neuromorphic olfactory system capable of detecting and memorizing the present level and accumulation status of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) during continuous gas exposure, regulating a self&#8208;alarm implementation triggered after 147 and 85 s at a continuous gas exposure of 20 and 40&#160;ppm, respectively. Thin&#8208;film&#8208;transistor type gas sensors utilizing carbon nanotube semiconductors detect NO2 gas molecules through carrier trapping and exhibit long&#8208;term retention properties, which are compatible with neuromorphic excitatory applications. Additionally, the neuromorphic inhibitory performance is also characterized via gas desorption with programmable ultraviolet light exposure, demonstrating homeostasis recovery. These results provide a promising strategy for developing a facile artificial olfactory system that demonstrates complicated biological synaptic functions with a seamless and simplified system architecture.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Anode Based on Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Glass</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Applying an isotropic metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) glass layer to unlock dendrite&#8208;free lithium metal anode is proposed. Simulation and experimental analyses corroborate the internal monolithic and interfacial merits of MOF glass, facilitating uniform lithium diffusion. The obtained lithium metal anode delivers superior battery performances. This work unveils the promising glassy MOF layer for high&#8208;performance lithium metal batteries.








Abstract
The performance of lithium metal batteries is severely hampered by uncontrollable dendrite growth and volume change within the anode. This work addresses these obstacles by introducing a novel strategy: applying an isotropic and internal grain&#8208;boundary&#8208;free layer, specifically, a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) glass layer with nano&#8208;porosity onto the electrochemically plated lithium metal anode. Both ab initio and classical molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the MOF glass layer makes the lithium transport smooth and uniform via its internal monolithic and interfacial advantages. This MOF glass layer with the fast and more uniform lithium diffusion in the monolithic interior and its interface enables dendrite&#8208;free lithium plating and stripping through surface confinement effect and interfacial effect. When employed in symmetric batteries, the achieved Li metal anode can operate over 300&#160;h at 1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. The full batteries matched with LiFePO4 exhibit high capacity (148&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1), excellent rate performance (61&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 5&#160;C), and outstanding cycling stability (with capacity retention of &#8776;90% after 1000 cycles). The full batteries matched with high&#8208;voltage LiCoO2 also show superior performances. Therefore, the strategy of utilizing a MOF glass layer enables the development of high&#8208;performance lithium metal anodes.

         <title>A Homochiral Porous Organic Cage&#8208;Polymer Membrane for Enantioselective Resolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, an enantioselective porous organic cage (Covalent cage 3 (CC3)&#8208;R)&#8208;based composite membrane using polyamide (PA) as a matrix is prepared via interfacial polymerization. The resultant CC3&#8208;R/PA composite membranes achieve chiral separation toward limonene racemates with enantiomeric excess values of 95.2% (R&#8208;enantiomers in excess) and a high flux of enantiomers of 99.9&#160;mg h&#8722;1 m&#8722;2.








Abstract
Membrane&#8208;based enantioselective separation is a promising method for chiral resolution due to its low cost and high efficiency. However, scalable fabrication of chiral separation membranes displaying both high enantioselectivity and high flux of enantiomers is still a challenge. Here, the authors report the preparation of homochiral porous organic cage (Covalent cage 3 (CC3)&#8208;R)&#8208;based enantioselective thin&#8208;film&#8208;composite membranes using polyamide (PA) as the matrix, where fully organic and solvent&#8208;processable cage crystals have good compatibility with the polymer scaffold. The hierarchical CC3&#8208;R channels consist of chiral selective windows and inner cavities, leading to favorable chiral resolution and permeation of enantiomers; the CC3&#8208;R/PA composite membranes display an enantiomeric excess of 95.2% for R&#8208;(+)&#8208;limonene over S&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;limonene and a high flux of 99.9&#160;mg h&#8722;1 m&#8722;2. This work sheds light on the use of homochiral porous organic cages for preparing enantioselective membranes and demonstrates a new route for the development of next&#8208;generation chiral separation membranes.

         <title>Electric Double Layer Oriented Eutectic Additive Design toward Stable Zn Anodes with a High Depth of Discharge</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly polarized eutectic additive, glycerophosphorylcholine (GPC), is investigated to regulate the electric double layer for long&#8208;lived and highly (002) textured Zn anodes with a high depth of discharge. The hydrogen bond network in EDL can be interrupted to suppress HER effectively. The enrichment of GPC in charge&#8208;rich sites leads to a robust ZnxPyOz&#8208;rich solid&#8211;electrolyte interphase and dendrite termination.








Abstract
ZnSO4&#8208;based electrolytes for aqueous zinc ion batteries fail to meet practical application metrics due to hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and dendrite growth. In this work, a highly polarized eutectic additive, glycerophosphorylcholine (GPC) is rationally designed, to regulate the electric double layer (EDL) structure for stable Zn anodes with a high depth of discharge (DOD). On one hand, GPC molecules with abundant hydroxyl groups can precisely regulate the hydrogen bond network in EDL to suppress HER. On the other hand, the enrichment of GPC at the interface is positively responsible for the negative charge density on the Zn surface, which leads to the formation of a robust ZnxPyOz&#8208;rich solid&#8211;electrolyte interphase and terminates dendrite growth in the charge&#8208;rich sites. This EDL&#8208;oriented eutectic additive engineering enables highly reversible and selectively (002)&#8208;textured Zn anodes to operate for over 1450&#160;h at a high DOD of 45.3%. Meanwhile, a high&#8208;capacity (185.7&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1) aqueous Zn||VS2 full cell shows remarkable cycling stability over 220 cycles with an excellent capacity retention of 90.4% even at a low current density of 0.1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 (0.5&#160;C). This work sheds light on electrolyte design and interface engineering for high&#8208;performance aqueous batteries.

This work sheds light on electrolyte design and interface engineering for high-performance aqueous batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Approaching the Ideal Linearity in Epitaxial Crystalline&#8208;Type Memristor by Controlling Filament Growth</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crystalline Hf0.5Zr0.5O2&#8208;based memristor with the linearity and symmetry approaching ideal case is demonstrated. The growth of filament is controlled by the confined grain boundaries and enhanced local electric field by inserting a layer of Cu nanoparticles within epitaxial Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 film. Furthermore, the decimal operation and high&#8208;accuracy neural network are successfully demonstrated.








Abstract
Brain&#8208;inspired neuromorphic computing has attracted widespread attention owing to its ability to perform parallel and energy&#8208;efficient computation. However, the synaptic weight of amorphous/polycrystalline oxide based memristor usually exhibits large nonlinear behavior with high asymmetry, which aggravates the complexity of peripheral circuit system. Controllable growth of conductive filaments is highly demanded for achieving the highly linear conductance modulation. However, the stochastic behavior of the filament growth in commonly used amorphous/polycrystalline oxide memristor makes it very challenging. Here, the epitaxially grown Hf0.5Zr0.5O2&#8208;based memristor with the linearity and symmetry approaching ideal case is reported. A layer of Cu nanoparticles is inserted into epitaxially grown Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 film to form the grain boundaries due to the breaking of the epitaxial growth. By combining with the local electric field enhancement, the growth of filament is confined in the grain boundaries due to the fact that the diffusion of oxygen vacancy in crystalline lattice is more difficult than that in the grain boundaries. Furthermore, the decimal operation and high&#8208;accuracy neural network are demonstrated by utilizing the highly linear and multi&#8208;level conductance modulation capacity. This method opens an avenue to control the filament growth for the application of resistance random access memory (RRAM) and neuromorphic computing.

         <title>Revealing the Nature of Binary&#8208;Phase on Structural Stability of Sodium Layered Oxide Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research introduces the relationship between different phase ratios in cathode materials and their electrochemical properties for sodium&#8208;ion batteries, showing that an inappropriate composite structure is more destructive than a single&#8208;phase design. Combines with different characterizations, optional Na0.76Cu0.1Co0.1Ni0.25Mn0.4Ti0.15O2 cathode material with reasonable phase ratios can effectively alleviate the degree of phase transformation under voltage, resulting in improved electrochemical performance.








Abstract
The emergence of layered sodium transition metal oxides featuring a multiphase structure presents a promising approach for cathode materials in sodium&#8208;ion batteries, showcasing notably improved energy storage capacity. However, the advancement of cathodes with multiphase structures faces obstacles due to the limited understanding of the integrated structural effects. Herein, the integrated structural effects by an in&#8208;depth structure&#8208;chemistry analysis in the developed layered cathode system NaxCu0.1Co0.1Ni0.25Mn0.4Ti0.15O2 with purposely designed P2/O3 phase integration, are comprehended. The results affirm that integrated phase ratio plays a pivotal role in electrochemical/structural stability, particularly at high voltage and with the incorporation of anionic redox. In contrast to previous reports advocating solely for the enhanced electrochemical performance in biphasic structures, it is demonstrated that an inappropriate composite structure is more destructive than a single&#8208;phase design. The in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction results, coupled with density functional theory computations further confirm that the biphasic structure with P2:O3 = 4:6 shows suppressed irreversible phase transition at high desodiated states and thus exhibits optimized electrochemical performance. These fundamental discoveries provide clues to the design of high&#8208;performance layered oxide cathodes for next&#8208;generation SIBs.

         <title>Porous Aromatic Frameworks Enabling Polyiodide Confinement toward High Capacity and Long Lifespan Zinc&#8211;Iodine Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous aromatic framework (PAF) with abundant benzene motifs and well&#8208;organized pore structures is adopted as iodine host. Due to the charge&#8208;transfer interaction with iodine, high specific surface area and interconnected 3D channels for ion transportation, PAF&#8208;1 shows a high capacity of 328 mAh g&#8722;1 and a stable cycling life of more than 20&#160;000 cycles.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8211;iodine batteries (AZIBs) are attracting increasing attention because of their high safety and abundance of resources. However, the performance of AZIBs is compromised by inadequate confinement of soluble polyiodides, the undesired shuttle effect, and slow reaction kinetics. In this study, a porous aromatic framework (PAF) with abundant benzene motifs and a well&#8208;organized pore structure is adopted as the iodine host, which exhibits high iodine adsorption capacity and robust polyiodide confinement. Both experimental characterizations and theoretical simulations indicate that the interactions between iodine species and the PAF&#8208;1 facilitate the redox reaction by coupling the electronic structures of the active species in the framework. A comparison of PAF&#8208;1, PAF&#8208;5, and PAF&#8208;11 also emphasizes the structural advantages of the high surface area and interconnected three&#8208;dimensional channels of PAF&#8208;1. Consequently, the I2@PAF&#8208;1 cathode can deliver a high capacity of 328 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 C, outstanding rate performance, and a stable cycling life of 20&#160;000 cycles (86 % retention at 10 C). The robust polyiodide confinement and superb electrochemical performance of Zn&#8211;I2@PAF&#8208;1 provide insights into the practical application of PAFs as excellent electrode materials for AZIBs.

         <title>A General Molecular Structural Design for Highly Efficient Photopyroptosis that can be Activated within 10 s Irradiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and rational principle is developed to design the molecular structure of photosensitizers for highly efficient photopyroptosis. Under the guidance of this principle, the pyroptotic trigger can be achieved in a minimum of 10 s of irradiation with a substantially low light dosage (0.4 J&#160;cm&#8315;2). In photodynamic therapy, immunotherapy with high tumor inhibition rates is achieved by applying the synthetic molecule alone.








Abstract
Photopyroptosis is an emerging research branch of photodynamic therapy (PDT), whereas there remains a lack of molecular structural principles to fabricate photosensitizers for triggering a highly efficient pyroptosis. Herein, a general and rational structural design principle to implement this hypothesis, is proposed. The principle relies on the clamping of cationic moieties (e.g., pyridinium, imidazolium) onto one photosensitive core to facilitate a considerable mitochondrial targeting (both of the inner and the outer membranes) of the molecules, thus maximizing the photogenerated reactive oxygen species (ROS) at the specific site to trigger the gasdermin E&#8208;mediated pyroptosis. Through this design, the pyroptotic trigger can be achieved in a minimum of 10 s of irradiation with a substantially low light dosage (0.4 J&#160;cm&#8315;2), compared to relevant work reported (up to 60 J&#160;cm&#8315;2). Moreover, immunotherapy with high tumor inhibition efficiency is realized by applying the synthetic molecules alone. This structural paradigm is valuable for deepening the understanding of PDT (especially the mitochondrial&#8208;targeted PDT) from the perspective of pyroptosis, toward the future development of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art form of PDT.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Centered Organic Radicals&#8208;Involved Unified Heterogeneous Self&#8208;Fenton Process for Stable Mineralization of Micropollutants in Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a novel active species, oxygen&#8208;centered organic radicals, as a substitute for traditional transient active species in the photocatalytic degradation of organic micropollutants. Through integration with heterogeneous Fenton process, an impressive mineralization rate of up to 94% is attained, accompanied by exceptionally high photon utilization efficiency and stability.








Abstract
Removing organic micropollutants from water through photocatalysis is hindered by catalyst instability and substantial residuals from incomplete mineralization. Here, a novel water treatment paradigm, the unified heterogeneous self&#8208;Fenton process (UHSFP), which achieved an impressive 32% photon utilization efficiency at 470&#160;nm, and a significant 94% mineralization of organic micropollutants&#8212;all without the continual addition of oxidants and iron ions is presented. In UHSFP, the active species differs fundamentally from traditional photocatalytic processes. One electron acceptor unit of photocatalyst acquires only one photogenerated electron to convert into oxygen&#8208;centered organic radical (OCOR), then spontaneously completing subsequent processes, including pollutant degradation, hydrogen peroxide generation, activation, and mineralization of organic micropollutants. By bolstering electron&#8208;transfer capabilities and diminishing catalyst affinity for oxygen in the photocatalytic process, the generation of superoxide radicals is effectively suppressed, preventing detrimental attacks on the catalyst. This study introduces an innovative and cost&#8208;effective strategy for the efficient and stable mineralization of organic micropollutants, eliminating the necessity for continuous chemical inputs, providing a new perspective on water treatment technologies.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Channel Ca2+ Nanomodulator Induces Intracellular Ca2+ Disorders via Endogenous Ca2+ Redistribution for Tumor Radiosensitization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A capsaicin&#8208;conjugated and nitric oxide&#8208;grafted self&#8208;assembling peptide based nanofiber is presented, serving as a tumor&#8208;specific dual&#8208;channel Ca2+ nanomodulator with synchronous stimulation of the extracellular Ca2+ influx and the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release performances for inducing intracellular Ca2+ disorders and thus achieving tumor radiosensitization.








Abstract
Tumor cells harness Ca2+ to maintain cellular homeostasis and withstand external stresses from various treatments. Here, a dual&#8208;channel Ca2+ nanomodulator (CAP&#8208;P&#8208;NO) is constructed that can induce irreversible intracellular Ca2+ disorders via the redistribution of tumor&#8208;inherent Ca2+ for disrupting cellular homeostasis and thus improving tumor radiosensitivity. Stimulated by tumor&#8208;overexpressed acid and glutathione, capsaicin and nitric oxide are successively escaped from CAP&#8208;P&#8208;NO to activate the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 and the ryanodine receptor for the influx of extracellular Ca2+ and the release of Ca2+ in the endoplasmic reticulum, respectively. The overwhelming level of Ca2+ in tumor cells not only impairs the function of organelles but also induces widespread changes in the gene transcriptome, including the downregulation of a set of radioresistance&#8208;associated genes. Combining CAP&#8208;P&#8208;NO treatment with radiotherapy achieves a significant suppression against both pancreatic and patient&#8208;derived hepatic tumors with negligible side effects. Together, the study provides a feasible approach for inducing tumor&#8208;specific intracellular Ca2+ overload via endogenous Ca2+ redistribution and demonstrates the great potential of Ca2+ disorder therapy in enhancing the sensitivity for tumor radiotherapy.

         <title>Spatially Precise Genetic Engineering at the Electrode&#8208;Tissue Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops a versatile AAV&#8208;shRNA&#8208;delivery probe that seamlessly integrates abiotic and biotic engineering principles into the electrode&#8208;tissue interface. This system facilitates the highly effective downregulation of target gene within specific cell types at the electrode&#8208;tissue interface, and capability of recording neuronal activities continuously for several months, which is promising for clinical research of gene therapy to neurodegenerative diseases.








Abstract
The interface between electrodes and neural tissues plays a pivotal role in determining the efficacy and fidelity of neural activity recording and modulation. While considerable efforts have been made to improve the electrode&#8208;tissue interface, the majority of studies have primarily concentrated on the development of biocompatible neural electrodes through abiotic materials and structural engineering. In this study, an approach is presented that seamlessly integrates abiotic and biotic engineering principles into the electrode&#8208;tissue interface. Specifically, ultraflexible neural electrodes with short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) designed to silence the expression of endogenous genes within neural tissues are combined. The system facilitates shRNA&#8208;mediated knockdown of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) and polypyrimidine tract&#8208;binding protein 1 (PTBP1), two essential genes associated in neural survival/growth and neurogenesis, within specific cell populations located at the electrode&#8208;tissue interface. Additionally, it is demonstrated that the downregulation of PTEN in neurons can result in an enlargement of neuronal cell bodies at the electrode&#8208;tissue interface. Furthermore, the system enables long&#8208;term monitoring of neuronal activities following PTEN knockdown in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease and traumatic brain injury. The system provides a versatile approach for genetically engineering the electrode&#8208;tissue interface with unparalleled precision, paving the way for the development of regenerative electronics and next&#8208;generation brain&#8211;machine interfaces.

         <title>A Precursor&#8208;Derived Ultramicroporous Carbon for Printing Iontronic Logic Gates and Super&#8208;Varactors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel 3D printed in&#8208;plane asymmetric electrochemical capacitor&#8208;diode (CAPode) based on the selective ion&#8208;sieving effect depending on the ion size is presented. Two printing techniques together with suitable and fine&#8208;tuned inks are explored to fabricate different interdigital electrode structures: one ultramicroporous and mesoporous carbon. The devices are successfully utilized in logic gates (AND, OR) and for the first time tested as variable capacitor in a high&#8208;pass filter.








Abstract
A liquid precursor for 3D printing ultramicroporous carbons (pore width &lt;0.7&#160;nm) to create a novel in&#8208;plane capacitive&#8208;analog of semiconductor&#8208;based diodes (CAPodes) is presented. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept integrates functional EDLCs into microstructured iontronic devices. The working principle is based on selective ion&#8208;sieving, controlling the size of the electrolyte ions, and the nanoporous sieving carbon's pore size. By blocking bulky electrolyte ions from entering the sub&#8208;nanometer pores, a unidirectional charging characteristic with controllable ion flux is achieved, leading to diodic U&#8208;I characteristics with a high rectification ratio. The liquid precursor approach enables successful printing of miniaturized in&#8208;plane CAPodes. A combination of inkjet and extrusion printing techniques with suitable inks is explored to fabricate electrode materials with engineered porosity. Deliberate fine&#8208;tuning of the ultramicroporous carbon's porosity and surface area is achieved using a customized carbon precursor and CO2 etching techniques. Electrochemical evaluation of the printed CAPodes demonstrates successful miniaturization compared with macroscopic film assembly. 3D manufacturing and miniaturization allow for the integration of CAPodes into logic gate circuits (OR, AND). For the first time, these switchable devices are used as variable capacitors in a high&#8208;pass filter application, adjusting the cut&#8208;off frequency of applied alternating voltage analogous to an I&#8208;MOS varactor.

         <title>In Situ Preparation of Superconducting Infinite&#8208;Layer Nickelate Thin Films with Atomically Flat Surface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>

The superconducting infinite&#8208;layer nickelate films can be synthesized fully in vacuo${\mathrm{\text{in vacuo}}}$ using atomic hydrogen, while the atomically flat surface has been confirmed by atomic force microscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy. The in situ${\mathrm{\text{in situ}}}$ reduction method paves the way for surface&#8208;sensitive electronic structural characterizations, such as angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy.








Abstract
Since their discovery, the infinite&#8208;layer nickelates have been regarded as an appealing system for gaining deeper insights into high&#8208;temperature superconductivity (HTSC). However, the synthesis of superconducting samples has been proven to be challenging. Here, an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) in situ${\mathrm{\text{in situ}}}$ reduction method is developed using atomic hydrogen as a reducing agent and is applied in the lanthanum nickelate system. The reduction parameters, including the reduction temperature (TR) and hydrogen pressure (PH), are systematically explored. It is found that the reduction window for achieving superconducting transition is quite wide, reaching nearly 80&#176;C in TR and three orders of magnitude in PH when the reduction time is set to 30 min. And there exists an optimal PH for achieving the highest Tc if both TR and reduction time are fixed. More prominently, as confirmed by atomic force microscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy, the atomically flat surface can be preserved during the in situ${\mathrm{\text{in situ}}}$ reduction process, providing advantages over the ex situ${\mathrm{\text{ex situ}}}$ CaH2 method for surface&#8208;sensitive&#160;experiments.

         <title>Combating Atherosclerosis with Chirality/Phase Dual&#8208;Engineered Nanozyme Featuring Microenvironment&#8208;Programmed Senolytic and Senomorphic Actions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) based nanozyme is employed for atherosclerosis management by integrating dual strategies involving chirality and phase engineering. This approach harnesses the tailored nanozyme's potential to function as both senolytic and senomorphic agents, thereby exerting a comprehensive anti&#8208;senescence effect. The functional switching mechanism depends on the degree of senescence and the dosage of the nanozyme, allowing for self&#8208;programmed action.








Abstract
Senescence plays a critical role in the development and progression of various diseases. This study introduces an amorphous, high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA)&#8208;based nanozyme designed to combat senescence. By adjusting the nanozyme's composition and surface properties, this work analyzes its catalytic performance under both normal and aging conditions, confirming that peroxide and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity are crucial for its anti&#8208;aging therapeutic function. Subsequently, the chiral&#8208;dependent therapeutic effect is validated and the senolytic performance of D&#8208;handed PtPd2CuFe across several aging models is confirmed. Through multi&#8208;Omics&#160;analyses, this work explores the mechanism underlying the senolytic action exerted by nanozyme in depth. It is&#160;confirm that exposure to senescent conditions leads to the enrichment of copper and iron atoms in their lower oxidation states, disrupting the iron&#8208;thiol cluster in mitochondria and lipoic acid transferase, as well as oxidizing unsaturated fatty acids, triggering a cascade of cuproptosis and ferroptosis. Additionally, the concentration&#8208;dependent anti&#8208;aging effects of nanozyme is validated. Even an ultralow dose, the therapeutic can still act as a senomorphic, reducing the effects of senescence. Given its broad&#8208;spectrum action and concentration&#8208;adjustable anti&#8208;aging potential, this work confirms the remarkable therapeutic capability of D&#8208;handed PtPd2CuFe in managing atherosclerosis, a disease involving various types of senescent cells.

         <title>Confined Space Dual&#8208;Type Quantum Dots for High&#8208;Rate Electrochemical Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;thin layered double hydroxides (LDH) provide a stable and conductive confined space and dual&#8208;type semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) (Co9S8 and CdS) are skillfully constructed within the microenvironment. The flexible Co9S8&#8208;CdS/LDH exhibits high redox activity and stability. These findings provide unique insights for developing stable, ordered, and highly active QDs.








Abstract
Owing to the quantum size effect and high redox activity, quantum dots (QDs) play very essential roles toward electrochemical energy storage. However, it is very difficult to obtain different types and uniformly dispersed high&#8208;active QDs in a stable conductive microenvironment, because QDs prepared by traditional methods are mostly dissolved in solution or loaded on the surface of other semiconductors. Herein, dual&#8208;type semiconductor QDs (Co9S8 and CdS) are skillfully constructed within the interlayer of ultrathin&#8208;layered double hydroxides. In&#160;particular, the expandable interlayer provides a very suitable confined space for the growth and uniform dispersion of QDs, where Co9S8 originates from in situ transformation of cobalt atoms in laminate and CdS is generated from interlayer pre&#8208;embedding Cd2+. Meanwhile, XAFS and GGA+U calculations are employed to explore and prove the mechanism of QDs formation and energy storage characteristics as compared to surface loading QDs. Significantly, the hybrid supercapacitors achieve a high energy density of 329.2&#160;&#181;Wh&#160;cm&#8722;2, capacitance retention of 99.1%, and coulomb efficiency of 96.9% after 22&#160;000 cycles, which is superior to the reported QDs&#8208;based supercapacitors. These findings provide unique insights for designing and developing stable, ordered, and highly active QDs.

         <title>Engineering Metallic Alloy Electrode for Robust and Active Water Electrocatalysis with Large Current Density Exceeding 2000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2</title>

The kinetically sluggish and unstable oxygen evolution reaction&#160;(OER) electrocatalysts are elusive for large&#8208;scale industrial Hydrogen (H2) production. This work manifests that the phosphorization of Ni1&#8208;xFex nanochain arrays renders exceptionally low overpotential compared to benchmark IrO2. Moreover, the electrode permits robust water splitting at an extremely large current density of 2000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
The amelioration of brilliantly effective electrocatalysts working at high current density for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is imperative for cost&#8208;efficient electrochemical hydrogen production. Yet, the kinetically sluggish and unstable catalysts remain elusive to large&#8208;scale hydrogen (H2) generation for industrial applications. Herein, a new strategy is demonstrated to significantly enhance the intrinsic activity of Ni1&#8208;xFex nanochain arrays through a trace proportion of heteroatom phosphorus doping that permits robust water splitting at an extremely large current density of 1000 and 2000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for 760&#160;h. The in situ formation of Ni2P and Ni5P4 on Ni1&#8208;xFex nanochain arrays surface and hierarchical geometry of the electrode significantly promote the reaction kinetics and OER activity. The OER electrode provides exceptionally low overpotentials of 222 and 327&#160;mV at current densities of 10 and 2000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in alkaline media, dramatically lower than benchmark IrO2 and is among the most active catalysts yet reported. Remarkably, the alkaline electrolyzer renders a low voltage of 1.75&#160;V at a large current density of 1000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, indicating outperformed overall water splitting. The electrochemical fingerprints demonstrate vital progress toward large&#8208;scale H2 production for industrial water electrolysis.

Novel bismuth&#8208;nickel cobalt phosphide (CC/Bi&#8208;NCP) heterostructures with built&#8208;in electric fields are fabricated to ensure the formation of uniform high&#8208;load layered active materials for efficient charge and ion transport. The developed dual&#8208;role interlayer strategy considers both the effects of the interlayer on the outer layer preparation process and the electrochemical performance of the heterostructure.








Abstract
Nickel&#8208;cobalt (NiCo) phosphides (NCPs) possess high electrochemical activity, which makes them promising candidates for electrode materials in aqueous energy storage devices, such as supercapacitors and zinc (Zn) batteries. However, the actual specific capacitance and rate capability of NCPs require further improvement, which can be achieved through reasonable heterostructural design and loading conditions of active materials on substrates. Herein, novel hierarchical Bi&#8208;NCP heterogeneous structures with built&#8208;in electric fields consisting of bismuth (Bi) interlayers (electrodeposited on carbon cloth (CC)) are designed and fabricated to ensure the formation of uniform high&#8208;load layered active materials for efficient charge and ion transport. The resulting CC/Bi&#8208;NCP electrodes show a uniform, continuous, and high mass loading (&gt;3.5&#160;mg) with a superior capacitance reaching 1200 F&#160;g&#8722;1 at 1 A&#160;g&#8722;1 and 4129 mF&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 1 mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 combined with high&#8208;rate capability and durable cyclic stability. Moreover, assembled hybrid supercapacitors (HSCs), supercapatteries, and alkaline Zn&#8208;ion (AZBs) batteries constructed using these electrodes deliver high energy densities of 64.4, 81.8, and 319.1 Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1, respectively. Overall, the constructed NCPs with excellent aqueous energy storage performance have the potential for the development of novel transition metal&#8208;based heterostructure electrodes for advanced energy devices.

         <title>Achieving High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries by Modulating Li+ Desolvation Barrier with Liquid Crystal Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sulfonate anion&#8208;rich interface is constructed by tape&#8208;casting a liquid crystal polymer&#8208;containing layer on the separator to facilitate Li+ desolvation and improve Li2S precipitation kinetics. With this well&#8208;thought&#8208;out design, the battery performance exhibits excellent rate capability and long&#8208;term cycling stability. More importantly, under a low E/S ratio and high sulfur loading condition, the pouch cell delivers a remarkable areal capacity.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries offer high theoretical capacity but are hindered by poor rate capability and cycling stability due to sluggish Li2S precipitation kinetics. Here a sulfonate&#8208;group&#8208;rich liquid crystal polymer (poly&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;disulfonyl&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;benzidine terephthalamide, PBDT) is designed and fabricated to accelerate Li2S precipitation by promoting the desolvation of Li+ from electrolyte. PBDT&#8208;modified separators are employed to assemble Li&#8211;S batteries, which deliver a remarkable rate capacity (761 mAh g&#8722;1 at 4 C) and cycling stability (500 cycles with an average decay rate of 0.088% per cycle at 0.5 C). A PBDT&#8208;based pouch cell even delivers an exceptional capacity of &#8776;1400 mAh g&#8722;1 and an areal capacity of &#8776;11 mAh cm&#8722;2 under lean&#8208;electrolyte and high&#8208;sulfur&#8208;loading condition, demonstrating promise for practical applications. Results of Raman spectra, molecular dynamic (MD) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the abundant anionic sulfonate groups of PBDT aid in Li+ desolvation by attenuating Li+&#8208;solvent interactions and lowering the desolvation energy barrier. Plus, the polysulfide adsorption/catalysis is also excluded via electrostatic repulsion. This work elucidates the critical impact of Li+ desolvation on Li&#8211;S batteries and provides a new design direction for advanced Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Acoustically Enhanced Triboelectric Stethoscope for Ultrasensitive Cardiac Sounds Sensing and Disease Diagnosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work systematically analyzes the electromechanical output characteristics between a contact&#8208;separation triboelectric nanogenerator and a piezoelectric generator and proposes that triboelectric sensor features superior advantages over piezoelectric one for microquantity sensing originates from the fast saturated constitutive characteristic. By designing a trumpet&#8208;shaped auscultatory cavity, triboelectric stethoscope delivers 36&#160;dB signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio for human test.








Abstract
Electronic stethoscope used to detect cardiac sounds that contain essential clinical information is a primary tool for diagnosis of various cardiac disorders. However, the linear electromechanical constitutive relation makes conventional piezoelectric sensors rather ineffective to detect low&#8208;intensity, low&#8208;frequency heart acoustic signal without the assistance of complex filtering and amplification circuits. Herein, it is found that triboelectric sensor features superior advantages over piezoelectric one for microquantity sensing originated from the fast saturated constitutive characteristic. As a result, the triboelectric sensor shows ultrahigh sensitivity (1215&#160;mV Pa&#8722;1) than the piezoelectric counterpart (21&#160;mV Pa&#8722;1) in the sound pressure range of 50&#8211;80&#160;dB under the same testing condition. By designing a trumpet&#8208;shaped auscultatory cavity with a power function cross&#8208;section to achieve acoustic energy converging and impedance matching, triboelectric stethoscope delivers 36&#160;dB signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio for human test (2.3 times of that for piezoelectric one). Further combining with machine learning, five cardiac states can be diagnosed at 97% accuracy. In general, the triboelectric sensor is distinctly unique in basic mechanism, provides a novel design concept for sensing micromechanical quantities, and presents significant potential for application in cardiac sounds sensing and disease diagnosis.

         <title>Structural Defect&#8208;Enabled Magnetic Neutrality Nanoprobes for Ultra&#8208;High&#8208;Field Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Isolated Tumor Cells in Vivo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A structural defect&#8208;enabled magnetic neutrality nanoprobe (MNN) featuring exceptionally low magnetic susceptibility is constructed through an ingenious structural defect&#8208;enhanced strategy. Remarkably, under 9 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the MNN records an unprecedentedly low r2/r1 value (&#8776;1.06), enabling high&#8208;performance ultra&#8208;high&#8208;field MR imaging of previously MRI&#8208;undetectable isolated tumor cells with an extraordinary detection threshold of &#8776;0.16&#160;mm.








Abstract
The identification of metastasis &#8220;seeds,&#8221; isolated tumor cells (ITCs), is of paramount importance for the prognosis and tailored treatment of metastatic diseases. The conventional approach to clinical ITCs diagnosis through invasive biopsies is encumbered by the inherent risks of overdiagnosis and overtreatment. This underscores the pressing need for noninvasive ITCs detection methods that provide histopathological&#8208;level insights. Recent advancements in ultra&#8208;high&#8208;field (UHF) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have ignited hope for the revelation of minute lesions, including the elusive ITCs. Nevertheless, currently available MRI contrast agents are susceptible to magnetization&#8208;induced strong T2&#8208;decaying effects under UHF conditions, which compromises T1 MRI capability and further impedes the precise imaging of small lesions. Herein, this study reports a structural defect&#8208;enabled magnetic neutrality nanoprobe (MNN) distinguished by its paramagnetic properties featuring an exceptionally low magnetic susceptibility through atomic modulation, rendering it almost nonmagnetic. This unique characteristic effectively mitigates T2&#8208;decaying effect while concurrently enhancing UHF T1 contrast. Under 9 T MRI, the MNN demonstrates an unprecedentedly low r2/r1 value (&#8776;1.06), enabling noninvasive visualization of ITCs with an exceptional detection threshold of &#8776;0.16&#160;mm. These high&#8208;performance MNNs unveil the domain of hitherto undetectable minute lesions, representing a significant advancement in UHF&#8208;MRI for diagnostic purposes and fostering comprehensive metastasis research.

         <title>Tunable Negative and Positive Photoconductance in Van Der Waals Heterostructure for Image Preprocessing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the negative and positive photoconductance effects conversion and the dark current suppression are realized by applying various laser power densities on a graphene/InSe/h&#8208;BN heterojunction&#8208;based FET. In addition, a modified photocurrent model as a function of laser power density is proposed to describe both negative and positive photoconductance effects. Finally, the van der Waals heterostructure is successfully applied to the image preprocessing.








Abstract
The processing of visual information occurs mainly in the retina, and the retinal preprocessing function greatly improves the transmission quality and efficiency of visual information. The artificial retina system provides a promising path to efficient image processing. Here, graphene/InSe/h&#8208;BN heterogeneous structure is proposed, which exhibits negative and positive photoconductance (NPC and PPC) effects by altering the strength of a single wavelength laser. Moreover, a modified theoretical model is presented based on the power&#8208;dependent photoconductivity effect of laser: Iph=&#8722;mP&#945;1+nP&#945;2${\rm I}_{\rm ph}\,=\,-{\rm mP}^{\alpha _{1}} + {\rm nP}^{\alpha _{2}}$, which can reveal the internal physical mechanism of negative/positive photoconductance effects. The present 2D structure design allows the field effect transistor (FET) to exhibit excellent photoelectric performance (RNPC&#160;=&#160;1.1&#215; 104&#160;AW&#8722;1, RPPC&#160;=&#160;13&#160;AW&#8722;1) and performance stability. Especially, the retinal pretreatment process is successfully simulated based on the negative and positive photoconductive effects. Moreover, the pulse signal input improves the device responsivity by 167%, and the transmission quality and efficiency of the visual signal can also be enhanced. This work provides a new design idea and direction for the construction of artificial vision, and lay a foundation for the integration of the next generation of optoelectronic&#160;devices.

         <title>Regulation of Protein Conformation Enables Cell&#8208;Selective Targeting of Virus&#8208;Mimicking Nanoparticles for siRNA Therapy of Glioblastoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, a strategy is proposed to regulate protein conformation through lipid nanoenvironment to build virus&#8208;mimicking nanoparticles (VMNs) for the efficient delivery of small interfering RNA, which have excellent cell&#8208;selective targeting ability and retain the lysosomal escape properties of the virus, thus enabling the precise enrichment of VMNs in glioblastoma brain tumor region for efficient therapeutic purposes.








Abstract
Orthotopic glioblastoma (GBM) has an aggressive growth pattern and complex pathogenesis, becoming one of the most common and deadly tumors of the central nervous system (CNS). The emergence of RNA therapies offers promise for the treatment of GBM. However, the efficient and precise delivery of RNA drugs to specific tumor cells in the brain with high cellular heterogeneity remains ongoing. Here, a strategy is proposed to regulate protein conformation through lipid nanoenvironments to custom&#8208;design virus&#8208;mimicking nanoparticles (VMNs) with excellent selective cell targeting capabilities, leading to efficient and precise delivery of small interfering RNA for effective treatment of GBM. The optimized VMNs not only retain the ability to cross the blood&#8211;brain barrier and release the RNA by lysosomal escape like natural viruses but also ensure precise enrichment in the GBM area. This study lays the conceptual foundation for the custom design of VMNs with superior cell&#8208;selective targeting capabilities and opens up the possibility of RNA therapies for the efficient treatment of GBM and CNS tumors.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Magnetic&#8208;Responsive Supramolecular&#8208;Covalent Semi&#8208;Convertible Hydrogel</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A magnetic&#8208;responsive semi&#8208;convertible hydrogel constructed through a universal supramolecular&#8208;covalent strategy exhibits reversible responsive lubricating capability. The application of magnetic field induces disassembly of the magnetic responsive gelatin/Fe3O4&#8208;NH2 network in the hydrogel, while the covalent PVA network retains the hydrogel structural integrity. A sol layer appears/disappears on the hydrogel surface following the magnetic field On/Off.








Abstract
Bio&#8208;inspired magnetic&#8208;responsive hydrogel is confined in exceedingly narrow spaces for soft robots and biomedicine in either gel state or magnetofluidic sol state. However, the motion of the gel state magnetic hydrogel will be inhibited in various irregular spaces due to the fixed shape and size and the sol&#8208;state magnetofluid gel may bring unpredictable residues in the confined narrow space. Inspired by the dynamic liquid lubricating mechanism of biological systems, novel magnetic&#8208;responsive semi&#8208;convertible hydrogel (MSCH) is developed through imbedding magnetic&#8208;responsive gelatin and amino&#8208;modified Fe3O4 nanoparticles network into the covalent network of polyvinyl alcohol, which can be switched between gel state and gel&#8211;sol state in response to magnetic stimuli. It can be attributed the disassembly of triple&#8208;helix structures of the gelatin under the action of the magnetic field, driven by force from the magnetic particles conjugated on the gelatin chain through electrostatic interactions, while the covalent network retains the hydrogel structural integrity. This leads to a sol layer on the MSCH surface enabling the MSCH to pass effectively through the confined channel or obstacle under magnetic field. The present MSCH will provide an alternative mode for magnetic field&#8208;related soft robots or actuators.

         <title>Bioinspired Flexible Hydrogelation with Programmable Properties for Tactile Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By modulating Fmoc&#8208;FF self&#8208;assembled architectures and improving their conductivity and adhesion, bioinspired supramolecular hydrogels of flexible mechanical rigidity, high conductivity, or high adhesion are achieved, respectively, which can be employed as an encapsulation layer, sensing unit, and adhesive layer for engineering tactile sensors. The findings establish the feasibility of developing peptide programmable hydrogelation of modulatable features for tactile sensing applications.








Abstract
Tactile sensing requires integrated detection platforms with distributed and highly sensitive haptic sensing capabilities along with biocompatibility, aiming to replicate the physiological functions of the human skin and empower industrial robotic and prosthetic wearers to detect tactile information. In this regard, short peptide&#8208;based self&#8208;assembled hydrogels show promising potential to act as bioinspired supramolecular substrates for developing tactile sensors showing biocompatibility and biodegradability. However, the intrinsic difficulty to modulate the mechanical properties severely restricts their extensive employment. Herein, by controlling the self&#8208;assembly of 9&#8208;fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl&#8208;modifid diphenylalanine (Fmoc&#8208;FF) through introduction of polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA), wider nanoribbons are achieved by untwisting from well&#8208;established thinner nanofibers, and the mechanical properties of the supramolecular hydrogels can be enhanced 10&#8208;fold, supplying bioinspired supramolecular encapsulating substrate for tactile sensing. Furthermore, by doping with poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and 9&#8208;fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl&#8208;modifid 3,4&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;l&#8208;phenylalanine (Fmoc&#8208;DOPA), the Fmoc&#8208;FF self&#8208;assembled hydrogels can be engineered to be conductive and adhesive, providing bioinspired sensing units and adhesive layer for tactile sensing applications. Therefore, the integration of these modules results in peptide hydrogelation&#8208;based tactile sensors, showing high sensitivity and sustainable responses with intrinsic biocompatibility and biodegradability. The findings establish the feasibility of developing programmable peptide self&#8208;assembly with adjustable features for tactile sensing applications.

         <title>Topology Reconfiguration of Anion&#8208;Pillared Metal&#8211;Organic Framework from Flexibility to Rigidity for Enhanced Acetylene Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The work presents a solvent&#8208;mediated approach to regulate the flexibility of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) by adjusting its topology, resulting in the transformation from flexible CuSnF6&#8208;dpds&#8208;sql MOFs to rigid CuSnF6&#8208;dpds&#8208;cds MOFs. This topology transformation strategy effectively enhances the adsorption capacity and kinetics for C2H2. Computational simulations and breakthrough experiments validate the effectiveness of this topology transformation strategy for gas separations.








Abstract
Flexible metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) adsorbents commonly encounter limitations in removing trace impurities below gate&#8208;opening threshold pressures. Topology reconfiguration can fundamentally eliminate intrinsic structural flexibility, yet remains a formidable challenge and is rarely achieved in practical applications. Herein, a solvent&#8208;mediated approach is presented to regulate the flexible CuSnF6&#8208;dpds&#8208;sql (dpds = 4,4&#8242;'&#8208;dipyridyldisulfide) with sql topology into rigid CuSnF6&#8208;dpds&#8208;cds with cds topology. Notably, the cds topology is unprecedented and first obtained in anion&#8208;pillared MOF materials. As a result, rigid CuSnF6&#8208;dpds&#8208;cds exhibits enhanced C2H2 adsorption capacity of 48.61 cm3 g&#8722;1 at 0.01&#160;bar compared to flexible CuSnF6&#8208;dpds&#8208;sql (21.06 cm3 g&#8722;1). The topology transformation also facilitates the adsorption kinetics for C2H2, exhibiting a 6.5&#8208;fold enhanced diffusion time constant (D/r2) of 1.71 &#215; 10&#8722;3 s&#8722;1 on CuSnF6&#8208;dpds&#8208;cds than that of CuSnF6&#8208;dpds&#8208;sql (2.64 &#215; 10&#8722;4 s&#8722;1). Multiple computational simulations reveal the structural transformations and guest&#8211;host interactions in both adsorbents. Furthermore, dynamic breakthrough experiments demonstrate that high&#8208;purity C2H4 (&gt;99.996%) effluent with a productivity of 93.9&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 can be directly collected from C2H2/C2H4 (1/99, v/v) gas&#8208;mixture in a single CuSnF6&#8208;dpds&#8208;cds column.

&lt;p&gt;The work presents a solvent-mediated approach to regulate the flexibility of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) by adjusting its topology, resulting in the transformation from flexible CuSnF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-dpds-&lt;b&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;sql&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; MOFs to rigid CuSnF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-dpds-&lt;b&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;cds&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; MOFs. This topology transformation strategy effectively enhances the adsorption capacity and kinetics for C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Computational simulations and breakthrough experiments validate the effectiveness of this topology transformation strategy for gas separations.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flexible metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) adsorbents commonly encounter limitations in removing trace impurities below gate-opening threshold pressures. Topology reconfiguration can fundamentally eliminate intrinsic structural flexibility, yet remains a formidable challenge and is rarely achieved in practical applications. Herein, a solvent-mediated approach is presented to regulate the flexible CuSnF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-dpds-&lt;b&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;sql&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; (dpds = 4,4&#8242;'-dipyridyldisulfide) with &lt;b&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;sql&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; topology into rigid CuSnF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-dpds-&lt;b&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;cds&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; with &lt;b&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;cds&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; topology. Notably, the &lt;b&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;cds&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; topology is unprecedented and first obtained in anion-pillared MOF materials. As a result, rigid CuSnF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-dpds-&lt;b&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;cds&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; exhibits enhanced C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption capacity of 48.61 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.01&#160;bar compared to flexible CuSnF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-dpds&lt;b&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;-sql&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; (21.06 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). The topology transformation also facilitates the adsorption kinetics for C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, exhibiting a 6.5-fold enhanced diffusion time constant (D/r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of 1.71 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; on CuSnF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-dpds&lt;b&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;-cds&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; than that of CuSnF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-dpds&lt;b&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;-sql&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; (2.64 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;).

         <title>Anomalous&#8208;Chern Steering of Topological Nonreciprocal Guided Waves</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a novel method for one&#8208;way, reconfigurable guiding of microwave photons along predefined paths on a 2D metamaterial platform, with unprecedented flexibility and reconfiguration speed. The new approach is based on topological effects inherent to unitary systems, and relies on doping a circulator scattering network with a tunable scatterers. This breakthrough paves way toward practical realization of reconfigurable topological meta&#8208;devices for robust communication technologies.








Abstract
Nonreciprocal topological edge states based on external magnetic bias have been regarded as the last resort for genuine unidirectional wave transport, showing superior robustness over topological states with preserved time&#8208;reversal symmetry. However, fast and efficient reconfigurability of their trajectory has remained a formidable challenge due to the difficulty in controlling the spatial distribution of magnetic fields over large areas and short times. Here, this&#160;persistent issue is solved by leveraging the rich topology of unitary scattering networks, and achieve fast steering of nonreciprocal topological transport at an interface between a Chern and an anomalous topological insulator, without having to control a magnetic field. Such interface can be drawn by doping the network with scatterers located at the center of each link, whose level of reflection is electrically tuned. With experiments in the GHz range, the possibility to actively steer the way of unidirectional edge states is demonstrated, switching the transmission path thousands of times per second in a fully&#8208;robust topological heterostructure. The approach represents a significant step towards the realization of practical reconfigurable topological meta&#8208;devices with broken time&#8208;reversal symmetry, and their application to future robust communication&#160;technologies.

         <title>Nature&#8208;Inspired Helicoidal Nanocellulose&#8208;Based Multi&#8208;Compartment Assemblies with Tunable Chiroptical Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly and grazing incidence spraying is used to fabricate organized nanocellulose&#8208;based structures with nanoscale controlled helicoidal arrangement of cellulose nanofibrils. Experimental results demonstrate that this additive manufacturing approach allows for high tunability in layer composition and structure, resulting in nanocomposite films with complex controlled internal structures and tailored chiroptical properties.








Abstract
Cellulose&#8208;based nanocomposites are highly appealing for the development of next&#8208;generation sustainable functional materials. Although many advances have been made in this direction, the true potential of fibrillar nanocomposites has yet to be realized because available fabrication approaches are inadequate for achieving precise structural control at the sub&#8208;micrometer scale. Here a spray&#8208;assisted alignment methodology of cellulose nanofibrils is combined with the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly into an additive manufacturing process in which the alignment direction of each cellulose layer is rationally selected to achieve thin films with a helicoidal arrangement of the nanofibrils. The helicoidal structure of the films is verified by measuring the circular dichroism (CD) of the samples. The sign and position of the structural CD peak show that the handedness and the pitch of the chiral structures can be easily tuned by deliberately selecting simple parameters, such as the number of consecutive cellulose layers sprayed in the same direction, and the angle of rotation between successive stacks of layers. To the authors&#8217; knowledge, this approach is unique as it offers the possibility to prepare complex nanocomposite architectures with various nanoscale&#8208;controlled sub&#8208;structures from different anisometric objects, which is enabling novel designs of composite films with damage&#8208;resistant and/or optical filtering functionalities.

         <title>Linear Electro&#8208;Optic Effect in 2D Ferroelectric for Electrically Tunable Metalens</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D ferroelectric metalens, composed of CuInP2S6, is demonstrated with electrically tunability. The linear electric&#8208;field modulation of light is verified in 2D ferroelectric CuInP2S6, yielding an effective electro&#8208;optic coefficient rc of 20.28 pm V&#8211;1. The 2D ferroelectric Fresnel metalens shows efficacious focusing ability with an electrical modulation efficiency of the focusing exceeding 34%.








Abstract
The advent of 2D ferroelectrics, characterized by their spontaneous polarization states in layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer domains without the limitation of a finite size effect, brings enormous promise for applications in integrated optoelectronic devices. Comparing with semiconductor/insulator devices, ferroelectric devices show natural advantages such as non&#8208;volatility, low energy consumption and high response speed. Several 2D ferroelectric materials have been reported, however, the device implementation particularly for optoelectronic application remains largely hypothetical. Here, the linear electro&#8208;optic effect in 2D ferroelectrics is discovered and electrically tunable 2D ferroelectric metalens is demonstrated. The linear electric&#8208;field modulation of light is verified in 2D ferroelectric CuInP2S6. The in&#8208;plane phase retardation can be continuously tuned by a transverse DC electric field, yielding an effective electro&#8208;optic coefficient rc of 20.28 pm V&#8211;1. The CuInP2S6 crystal exhibits birefringence with the fast axis oriented along its (010) plane. The 2D ferroelectric Fresnel metalens shows efficacious focusing ability with an electrical modulation efficiency of the focusing exceeding 34%. The theoretical analysis uncovers the origin of the birefringence and unveil its ultralow light absorption across a wide wavelength range in this non&#8208;excitonic system. The van der Waals ferroelectrics enable room&#8208;temperature electrical modulation of light and offer the freedom of heterogeneous integration with silicon and another material system for highly compact and tunable photonics and&#160;metaoptics.

Biomass solid&#8208;state electrolytes with abundant ion and water channels are constructed by knitting the OH&#8722;&#8208;conductive cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) and water&#8208;retentive CNFs together via an energy&#8208;efficient tape casting for Zn&#8211;air batteries, which reveal impressive OH&#8722; conductivity of 175&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 with high water uptake, thus affording the exceptional cycle lifespan of 310&#160;h and power density of 126&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Flexible zinc&#8211;air batteries are the leading candidates as the next&#8208;generation power source for flexible/wearable electronics. However, constructing safe and high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) with intrinsic hydroxide ion (OH&#8722;) conduction remains a fundamental challenge. Herein, by adopting the natural and robust cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) as building blocks, the biomass SSEs with penetrating ion and water channels are constructed by knitting the OH&#8722;&#8208;conductive CNFs and water&#8208;retentive CNFs together via an energy&#8208;efficient tape casting. Benefiting from the abundant ion and water channels with interconnected hydrated OH&#8722; wires for fast OH&#8722; conduction under a nanoconfined environment, the biomass SSEs reveal the high water&#8208;uptake, impressive OH&#8722; conductivity of 175&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 and mechanical robustness simultaneously, which overcomes the commonly existed dilemma between ion conductivity and mechanical property. Remarkably, the flexible zinc&#8211;air batteries assemble with biomass SSEs deliver an exceptional cycle lifespan of 310&#160;h and power density of 126&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2. The design methodology for water and ion channels opens a new avenue to design high&#8208;performance SSEs for batteries.

         <title>A Strong, Tough, and Stable Composite with Nacre&#8208;Inspired Sandwich Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The composite inspired by nacre is prepared by incorporating dual&#8208;phase alumina nanowires as reinforcement and bridging components to form a 1D sandwich structure through vacuum&#8208;assisted suction filtration. The mechanical behaviors of hierarchical fracture resistance contributes to their excellent high strength, toughness, and stability, providing new design for solving conflicts between strength and toughness in engineering materials.








Abstract
Improving the fracture resistance of nacre&#8208;inspired composites is crucial in addressing the strength&#8208;toughness trade&#8208;off. However, most previously proposed strategies for enhancing fracture resistance in these composites have been limited to interfacial modification by polymer, which restricts mechanical enhancement. Here, a composite material consisting of graphene oxide (GO) lamellae and nanocrystalline reinforced amorphous alumina nanowires (NAANs) has been developed. The structure of the composite is inspired by nacre and is composed of stacked GO nanosheets with NAANs in between, forming a sandwich&#8208;like structure. This design enhances the fracture resistance of the composite through the pull&#8208;out of GO nanosheets at the nanoscale and GO/NAANs sandwich&#8208;like coupling at the micro&#8208;scale, while also providing stiff ceramic support. This composite simultaneously possesses high strength (887.8&#160;MPa), toughness (31.6&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3), superior cyclic stability (1600 cycles), and long&#8208;term (2 years) immersion stability, which outperform previously reported GO&#8208;based lamellar composites. The hierarchical fracture design provides a new path to design next&#8208;generation strong, tough, and stable materials for advanced engineering applications.

         <title>Fusion Bonding Technique for Solvent&#8208;Free Fabrication of All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Battery with Ultrathin Sulfide Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solvent&#8208;free manufacturing has huge potential for sulfide all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs). This work demonstrates a new solvent&#8208;free paradigm of fusion bonding technique to fabricate sulfide ASSBs with optimized interface and ability to dissipate excessive stress. This strategy not only prolongs the cycle life to over 10,000 h, and is suitable for preparing practical batteries of bipolar and pouch cells.








Abstract
For preparing next&#8208;generation sulfide all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs), the solvent&#8208;free manufacturing process has huge potential for the advantages of economic, thick electrode, and avoidance of organic solvents. However, the dominating solvent&#8208;free process is based on the fibrillation of polytetrafluoroethylene, suffering from poor mechanical property and electrochemical instability. Herein, a continuously solvent&#8208;free paradigm of fusion bonding technique is developed. A percolation network of thermoplastic polyamide (TPA) binder with low viscosity in viscous state is constructed with Li6PS5Cl (LPSC) by thermocompression (&#8804;5&#160;MPa), facilitating the formation of ultrathin LPSC film (&#8804;25&#160;&#181;m). This composite sulfide film (CSF) exhibits excellent mechanical properties, ionic conductivity (2.1 mS cm&#8722;1), and unique stress&#8208;dissipation to promote interface stabilization. Thick LiNi0.83Co0.11Mn0.06O2 cathode can be prepared by this solvent&#8208;free method and tightly adhered to CSF by interfacial fusion of TPA for integrated battery. This integrated ASSB shows high&#8208;energy&#8208;density feasibility (&gt;2.5 mAh cm&#8722;2 after 1400 cycles of 9200 h and run for more than 10&#8239;000 h), and energy density of 390 Wh kg&#8722;1 and 1020 Wh L&#8722;1. More specially, high&#8208;voltage bipolar cell (&#8805;8.5&#160;V) and bulk&#8208;type pouch cell (326 Wh kg&#8722;1) are facilely assembled with good cycling performance. This work inspires commercialization of ASSBs by a solvent&#8208;free method and provides beneficial guiding for stable batteries.

         <title>Polyacrylonitrile as an Efficient Transfer Medium for Wafer&#8208;Scale Transfer of Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, by using polyacrylonitrile as the transfer medium and encapsulating layer, wafer&#8208;scale graphene transfer, devices fabrication, and efficient encapsulation against the airborne contaminations are successfully achieved, and the transferred graphene delivers improved electronic performances and long&#8208;term stability, offering a reliable method for fabricating wafer&#8208;scale devices of 2D materials with outstanding electronic quality.








Abstract
The disparity between growth substrates and application&#8208;specific substrates can be mediated by reliable graphene transfer, the lack of which currently strongly hinders the graphene applications. Conventionally, the removal of soft polymers, that support the graphene during the transfer, would contaminate graphene surface, produce cracks, and leave unprotected graphene surface sensitive to airborne contaminations. In this work, it is found that polyacrylonitrile (PAN) can function as polymer medium for transferring wafer&#8208;size graphene, and encapsulating layer to deliver high&#8208;performance graphene devices. Therefore, PAN, that is compatible with device fabrication, does not need to be removed for subsequent applications. The crack&#8208;free transfer of 4 in. graphene onto SiO2/Si wafers, and the wafer&#8208;scale fabrication of graphene&#8208;based field&#8208;effect transistor arrays with no observed clear doping, uniformly high carrier mobility (&#8776;11&#160;000 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1), and long&#8208;term stability at room temperature, are achieved. This work presents new concept for designing the transfer process of 2D materials, in which multifunctional polymer can be retained, and offers a reliable method for fabricating wafer&#8208;scale devices of 2D materials with outstanding performance.

         <title>A Single Component, Single Layer Flexile Foam Evaporator with the Higher Efficiency for Water Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper presents a single component hydrophilic polymer evaporator with a record evaporation rate of 4.32&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 under 1 sun and excellent resistance to mechanical and chemical damage. This flexible polymer evaporator has a new evaporation model and it is easy to synthesis and mold for better practical application in conjunction with automation equipment.








Abstract
One of the greenest and promising ways to solve the problem of freshwater crisis is surface solar steam generation from seawater. A great number of photothermal materials with multi&#8208;component and multi&#8208;layered delicate yet complex structures often suffer from either low evaporation rate or high energy loss. Here, this work presents a single component foam evaporator with steam generation rate of up to 4.32&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 under 1 sun irradiation. The evaporator is constructed from an aniline oligomer as a single light&#8208;absorbing component, covalent linked with polyethylene glycol to form a monolithic polymer foam. Floating on the seawater, the foam has absorbance of 99.5% over the entire solar spectral range and low thermal conductivity (0.0077&#160;W K&#8722;1m&#8722;1) that effectively retains heat in the material and at the interface. After 3 months of continuous outdoor natural sunlight irradiation, the evaporator maintains a stable and durable evaporation rate. Moreover, the materials have good mechanical properties (7.48&#160;MPa young's modulus and 57.38% elongation at break) and excellent chemical resistance in 10 common organic solvents and aqueous solutions of pH = 1 to 14. This study provides a new system and strategy for desalination, steam power generation, treatment of polluted water and sewage, etc.

         <title>Hidden Real Topology and Unusual Magnetoelectric Responses in Two&#8208;Dimensional Antiferromagnets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The monolayer Cr2Se2O is reported as the first material example of a 2D antiferromagnetic (AFM) real Chern insulator with topologically protected corner states. A hidden real topology in 2D AFM materials with mirror symmetry is unveiled. Due to antiferromagnetism, the corner modes in Cr2Se2O exhibit strong corner&#8208;contrasted spin polarization, leading to spin&#8211;corner coupling (SCC). SCC enables the direct control of the net magnetization of the system by both local and global electric methods.








Abstract
Recently, the real topology has been attracting widespread interest in two dimensions (2D). Here, based on first&#8208;principles calculations and theoretical analysis, the monolayer Cr2Se2O (ML&#8208;CrSeO) is revealed as the first material example of a 2D antiferromagnetic (AFM) real Chern insulator (RCI) with topologically protected corner states. Unlike previous RCIs, it is found that the real topology of the ML&#8208;CrSeO is rooted in one certain mirror subsystem of the two spin channels, and cannot be directly obtained from all the valence bands in each spin channel as commonly believed. In particular, due to antiferromagnetism, the corner modes in ML&#8208;CrSeO exhibit strong corner&#8208;contrasted spin polarization, leading to spin&#8211;corner coupling (SCC). This SCC enables a direct connection between spin space and real space. Consequently, large and switchable net magnetization can be induced in the ML&#8208;CrSeO nanodisk by electrostatic means, such as potential step and in&#8208;plane electric field, and the corresponding magnetoelectric responses behave like a sign function, distinguished from that of the conventional multiferroic materials. This work considerably broadens the candidate range of RCI materials, and opens up a new direction for topo&#8208;spintronics and 2D AFM materials&#160;research.

         <title>Scalable Optical Nose Realized with a Chemiresistively Modulated Light&#8208;Emitter Array</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An optical nose that integrates a large array of chemiresistive sensors with light&#8208;emitting diodes (ChemLEDs) is introduced. Each metal&#8208;oxide sensor, grown combinatorially,&#160;modulates the intensity of an LED in response to the gas mixture. The array of ChemLEDs displays a unique light pattern for various gas mixtures and permits the quantitative analysis of composition and analyte concentration using image analysis tools.








Abstract
Biological olfaction relies on a large number of receptors that function as sensors to detect gaseous molecules. It is challenging to realize artificial olfactory systems that contain similarly large numbers of sensory materials. It is shown that combinatorial materials processing with vapor deposition can be used to fabricate large arrays of distinct chemiresistive sensing materials. By combining these with light&#8208;emitting diodes, an array of chemiresistively&#8208;modulated light&#8208;emitting diodes, or ChemLEDs, that permit a simultaneous optical read&#8208;out in response to an analyte is obtained. The optical nose uses a common voltage source and ground for all sensing elements and thus eliminates the need for complex wiring of individual sensors. This optical nose contains one hundred ChemLEDs and generates unique light patterns in response to gases and their mixtures. Optical pattern recognition methods enable the quantitative prediction of the corresponding concentrations and compositions, thereby paving the way for massively parallel artificial olfactory systems. ChemLEDs open the possibility to explore demanding gas sensing applications, including in environmental, food quality monitoring, and potentially diagnostic settings.

         <title>Experimental Demonstration of Reservoir Computing with Self&#8208;Assembled Percolating Networks of Nanoparticles</title>

         <dc:description>
Brain&#8208;like computing with percolating networks of nanoparticles. Successful spoken digit recognition is achieved by converting audio waveforms to electrical signals which are classified using a reservoir computing scheme. The use of parallel reservoirs results in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art accuracy. Similar techniques allow prediction of complex time series as well as nonlinear transformations.








Abstract
The complex self&#8208;assembled network of neurons and synapses that comprises the biological brain enables natural information processing with remarkable efficiency. Percolating networks of nanoparticles (PNNs) are complex self&#8208;assembled nanoscale systems that have been shown to possess many promising brain&#8208;like attributes and which are therefore appealing systems for neuromorphic computation. Here experiments are performed that show that PNNs can be utilized as physical reservoirs within a nanoelectronic reservoir computing framework and demonstrate successful computation for several benchmark tasks (chaotic time series prediction, nonlinear transformation, and memory capacity). For each task, relevant literature results are compiled and it is shown that the performance of the PNNs compares favorably to that previously reported from nanoelectronic reservoirs. It is then demonstrated experimentally that PNNs can be used for spoken digit recognition with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art accuracy. Finally, a parallel reservoir architecture is emulated, which increases the dimensionality and richness of the reservoir outputs and results in further improvements in performance across all tasks.

         <title>Catheter&#8208;Directed Ionic Liquid Embolic Agent for Rapid Portal Vein Embolization, Segmentectomy, and Bile Duct Ablation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Embolic materials currently used for PVE do not treat the tumor, risking tumor progression during the interval between PVE and surgery. Here, an ionic&#8208;liquid&#8208;based embolic material (LEAD) is developed that can embolize, ablate, and deliver therapeutics. With its ease of use and a high safety profile demonstrated in animal studies, LEAD offers a potential alternative to tumor ablation with or without PVE for FLR growth.









Abstract
Embolic materials currently in use for portal vein embolization (PVE) do not treat the tumor, which poses a risk for tumor progression during the interval between PVE and surgical resection. Here, is developed an ionic&#8208;liquid&#8208;based embolic material (LEAD) for portal vein embolization, liver ablation, and drug delivery. LEAD is optimized and characterized for diffusivity, X&#8208;ray visibility, and cytotoxicity. In the porcine renal embolization model, LEAD delivered from the main renal artery reached vasculature down to 10 microns with uniform tissue ablation and delivery of small and large therapeutics. In non&#8208;survival and survival porcine experiments, successful PVE is achieved in minutes, leading to the expected chemical segmentectomy, and delivery of a large protein drug (i.e., Nivolumab) with LEAD. In cholangiocarcinoma mouse tumor models and in ex vivo human tumors, LEAD consistently achieved an effective ablation and wide drug distribution. Furthermore, various strains of drug&#8208;resistant patient&#8208;derived bacteria showed significant susceptibility to LEAD, suggesting that LEAD may also prevent infectious complications resulting from tissue ablation. With its capabilities to embolize, ablate, and deliver therapeutics, ease of use, and a high safety profile demonstrated in animal studies, LEAD offers a potential alternative to tumor ablation with or without PVE for FLR growth.

With its ease of use and a high safety profile demonstrated in animal studies, LEAD offers a potential alternative to tumor ablation with or without PVE for FLR growth.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Embolic materials currently in use for portal vein embolization (PVE) do not treat the tumor, which poses a risk for tumor progression during the interval between PVE and surgical resection. Here, is developed an ionic-liquid-based embolic material (LEAD) for portal vein embolization, liver ablation, and drug delivery. LEAD is optimized and characterized for diffusivity, X-ray visibility, and cytotoxicity. In the porcine renal embolization model, LEAD delivered from the main renal artery reached vasculature down to 10 microns with uniform tissue ablation and delivery of small and large therapeutics. In non-survival and survival porcine experiments, successful PVE is achieved in minutes, leading to the expected chemical segmentectomy, and delivery of a large protein drug (i.e., Nivolumab) with LEAD. In cholangiocarcinoma mouse tumor models and in ex vivo human tumors, LEAD consistently achieved an effective ablation and wide drug distribution. Furthermore, various strains of drug-resistant patient-derived bacteria showed significant susceptibility to LEAD, suggesting that LEAD may also prevent infectious complications resulting from tissue ablation. With its capabilities to embolize, ablate, and deliver therapeutics, ease of use, and a high safety profile demonstrated in animal studies, LEAD offers a potential alternative to tumor ablation with or without PVE for FLR growth.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Suspended, 3D Morphing Sensory System for Robots to Feel and Protect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Suspended electronic skins that enable structural integration of high&#8208;sensitive touch and dynamic pain perception are rationally designed through 3D deformation&#8208;mechanical contact mechanism, which show potentials in friendly human&#8211;robot interaction for active feel and protect.








Abstract
Artificial sensory systems with synergistic touch and pain perception hold substantial promise for environment interaction and human&#8211;robot communication. However, the realization of biological skin&#8208;like functional integration of sensors with sensitive touch and pain perception still remains a challenge. Here, a concept is proposed of suspended electronic skins enabling 3D deformation&#8208;mechanical contact interactions for achieving synergetic ultrasensitive touch and adjustable pain perception. The suspended sensory system can sensitively capture tiny touch stimuli as low as 0.02&#160;Pa and actively perceive pain response with reliable 5200 cycles via 3D deformation and mechanical contact mechanism, respectively. Based on the touch&#8208;pain effect, a visualized feedback demo with miniaturized sensor arrays on artificial fingers is rationally designed to give a pain perception mapping on sharp surfaces. Furthermore, the capability is shown of the suspended electronic skin serving as a safe human&#8211;robot communication interface from active and passive view through a feedback control system, demonstrating potential in bionic electronics and intelligent robotics.

         <title>Electrical Doping of Metal Halide Perovskites by Co&#8208;Evaporation and Application in PN Junctions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlled electrical n&#8208; and p&#8208;doping of metal halide perovskites (MHPs) is demonstrated by co&#8208;evaporating molecular dopants alongside the perovskite precursors. The doped layers are integrated into PN and NP diodes that show opposing trends in rectification. Doping of perovskites opens the path for their integration into novel applications beyond photovoltaics such as thermoelectrics and complementary logic.








Abstract
Electrical doping of semiconductors is a revolutionary development that enabled many electronic and optoelectronic technologies. While doping of many inorganic and organic semiconductors is well&#8208;established, controlled electrical doping of metal halide perovskites (MHPs) is yet to be demonstrated. In this work, efficient n&#8208; and p&#8208;type electrical doping of MHPs by co&#8208;evaporating the perovskite precursors alongside organic dopant molecules is achieved. It is demonstrated that the Fermi level can be shifted by up to 500 meV toward the conduction band and by up to 400 meV toward the valence band by n&#8208; and p&#8208;doping, respectively, which increases the conductivity of the films. The doped layers are employed in PN and NP diodes, showing opposing trends in rectification. Demonstrating controlled electrical doping by a scalable, industrially relevant deposition method opens the route to developing perovskite devices beyond solar cells, such as thermoelectrics or complementary logic.

         <title>Ion and Molecular Sieving With Ultrathin Polydopamine Nanomembranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first free&#8208;standing, ultrathin (10&#8211;17&#160;nm) nanomembranes composed entirely of polydopamine for efficient ion and molecular sieving via an easily scalable electropolymerization strategy are reported. These nanomembranes feature well&#8208;defined nanochannels and abundant amine and catechol groups, which provide a favorable chemical environment for ion&#8208;channel electrostatic and hydrogen bond interactions, emulating the analogous function of biological ion channels.









Abstract
In contrast to biological cell membranes, it is still a major challenge for synthetic membranes to efficiently separate ions and small molecules due to their similar sizes in the sub&#8208;nanometer range. Inspired by biological ion channels with their unique channel wall chemistry that facilitates ion sieving by ion&#8208;channel interactions, the first free&#8208;standing, ultrathin (10&#8211;17&#160;nm) nanomembranes composed entirely of polydopamine (PDA) are reported here as ion and molecular sieves. These nanomembranes are obtained via an easily scalable electropolymerization strategy and provide nanochannels with various amine and phenolic hydroxyl groups that offer a favorable chemical environment for ion&#8208;channel electrostatic and hydrogen bond interactions. They exhibit remarkable selectivity for monovalent ions over multivalent ions and larger species with K+/Mg2+ of &#8776;4.2, K+/[Fe(CN)6]3&#8722; of &#8776;10.3, and K+/Rhodamine B of &#8776;273.0 in a pressure&#8208;driven process, as well as cyclic reversible pH&#8208;responsive gating properties. Infrared spectra reveal hydrogen bond formation between hydrated multivalent ions and PDA, which prevents the transport of multivalent ions and facilitates high selectivity. Chemically rich, free&#8208;standing, and pH&#8208;responsive PDA nanomembranes with specific interaction sites are proposed as customizable high&#8208;performance sieves for a wide range of challenging separation requirements.

         <title>Stabilizing Ni2+ in Hollow Nano MOF/Polymetallic Phosphides Composites for Enhanced Electrochemical Performance in 3D&#8208;Printed Micro&#8208;Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni, which has stronger coordination ability with N, is introduced into the nano Co&#8208;MOF composite material to partially replace Co, and the hollow nanostructure is stabilized through low&#8208;temperature controllable formation rate of multi metal phosphides. The generation of Ni, Co, and P atoms during the reduction process effectively enhances the electron transfer rate within the framework.








Abstract
Polymetallic phosphides exhibit favorable conductivities. A reasonable design of nano&#8208;metal&#8211;organic frame (MOF) composite morphologies and in situ introduction of polymetallic phosphides into the framework can effectively improve electrolyte penetration and rapid electron transfer. To address existing challenges, Ni, with a strong coordination ability with N, is introduced to partially replace Co in nano&#8208;Co&#8211;MOF composite. The hollow nanostructure is stabilized through CoNi bimetallic coordination and low&#8208;temperature controllable polymetallic phosphide generation rate. The Ni, Co, and P atoms, generated during reduction, effectively enhance electron transfer rate within the framework. X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) characterization results further confirm the existence of Ni&#8211;N, Ni&#8211;Ni, and Co&#8211;Co structures in the nanocomposite. The changes in each component during the charge&#8211;discharge process of the electrochemical reactions are investigated using in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD). Theoretical calculations further confirm that P can effectively improve conductivity. VZNPGC//MXene MSCs, constructed with active materials derived from the hollow nano MOF composites synthesized through the Ni2+ stabilization strategy, demonstrate a specific capacitance of 1184 mF cm&#8722;2, along with an energy density of 236.75 &#181;Wh cm&#8722;2 (power density of 0.14 mW cm&#8722;2). This approach introduces a new direction for the synthesis of highly conductive nano&#8208;MOF composites.

Tissue Ablation
Portal vein embolization (PVE) does not treat the tumor, risking tumor progression during the interval between PVE and surgery. In article number 2402570, Rahmi Oklu and co&#8208;workers developed an ionic&#8208;liquid&#8208;based embolic material (LEAD) that can embolize, achieve ablative segmentectomy, and deliver therapeutics. With its ease of use and high safety profile, LEAD offers a potential alternative to tumor ablation with or without PVE.

Inhalable RNA Immunotherapy
In article number 2400307, Bowen Li and co&#8208;workers develop a tumor&#8208;tailored lipid nanoparticle system to deliver IL&#8208;12 circular RNA for enhanced lung cancer immunotherapy. Inhalation of these engineered nanoparticles can effectively induce immune activation, increase CD8+ T cell infiltration into tumor tissues, and lead to lung tumor regression, offering a promising strategy to improve treatment outcomes of lung cancer.

Metal&#8211;Semiconductor Feld&#8208;Effect Transistors
Utilizing a monolithic&#8208;oxide&#8208;gapped metal gate at the Schottky&#8208;Mott limit, the MoS2 metal&#8208;semiconductor field&#8208;effect transistor (MESFET) is demonstrated as distinct from the conventional metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (MOS) FET architecture. Due to strong gate coupling and excellent interface quality, the 2D MESFETs exhibit low voltage (&lt;1V) operation and Boltzmann&#8208;limited switching (&#8776;60 mV dec&#8722;1). More details can be found in article number 2314274 by Chul&#8208;Ho Lee and co&#8208;workers.

Overall Water Splitting
In article number 2401448, Usman Khan, Junkuo Gao, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate the impact of nanoscale surface morphologies on the release behavior of H2 and O2 bubbles for electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance by introducing surface&#8208;controlled Ni&#8208;based catalysts. The catalysts render exceptionally low overpotential compared to benchmark Pt/C and IrO2. Moreover, the electrode permits robust water splitting at an extremely large current density of 2000 mA cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Investigation of the Single&#8208;Particle Scale Structure&#8211;Activity Relationship Providing New Insights for the Development of High&#8208;Performance Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
Highly unified 3D evaluation of the physical characterization, electrochemical measurement, and theoretical simulation of active material single particle is a powerful means to deeply understand the structure&#8211;activity relationship of active materials and promote the rational design of the high&#8208;performance battery material and structure.








Abstract
As electric vehicles, portable electronic devices, and tools have increasingly high requirements for battery energy density and power density, constantly improving battery performance is a research focus. Accurate measurement of the structure&#8211;activity relationship of active materials is key to advancing the research of high&#8208;performance batteries. However, conventional performance tests of active materials are based on the electrochemical measurement of porous composite electrodes containing active materials, polymer binders, and conductive carbon additives, which cannot establish an accurate structure&#8211;activity relationship with the physical characterization of microregions. In this review, in order to promote the accurate measurement and understanding of the structure&#8211;activity relationship of materials, the electrochemical measurement and physical characterization of energy storage materials at single&#8208;particle scale are reviewed. The potential problems and possible improvement schemes of the single particle electrochemical measurement and physical characterization are proposed. Their potential applications in single particle electrochemical simulation and machine learning are prospected. This review aims to promote the further application of single particle electrochemical measurement and physical characterization in energy storage materials, hoping to achieve 3D unified evaluation of physical characterization, electrochemical measurement, and theoretical simulation at the single particle scale to provide new inspiration for the development of high&#8208;performance batteries.

         <title>Development of Electrolytes under Lean Condition in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Implementing lean electrolyte is a required condition to achieve high specific energy of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries at the cell level. This review analyzes the challenges induced by lean electrolyte condition focusing on the connection between polysulfide evolution pathways and fundamental solvation properties of the electrolytes. The working mechanisms and design principle of redox mediators and catalysts are also discussed.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries stand out as one of the promising candidates for next&#8208;generation electrochemical energy storage technologies. A key requirement to realize high&#8208;specific&#8208;energy Li&#8211;S batteries is to implement low amount of electrolyte, often characterized by the electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratio. Low E/S ratio aggravates the known challenges for Li&#8211;S batteries and introduces new ones originated from the high concentration of polysulfides in limited electrolyte reservoir. In this review, the connections between the fundamental properties of electrolytes and the electrochemical/chemical reactions in Li&#8211;S batteries under lean electrolyte condition are elucidated. The emphasis is on how the solvating properties of the electrolyte affect the fate of polysulfides. Built upon the mechanistic analysis, different strategies to design lean electrolytes to improve the overall process of Li&#8211;S reactions and Li anode protection are discussed.

         <title>Side Reactions/Changes in Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries: Mechanisms and Strategies for Creating Safer and Better Batteries</title>

Lithium&#8208;ion batteries are considered the most competitive energy storage devices. A deep understanding of the reactions that cause changes in the battery's internal components is needed to build safer and better batteries. This review focuses on the processes of battery failures, with voltage and temperature as the underlying factors.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), in which lithium ions function as charge carriers, are considered the most competitive energy storage devices due to their high energy and power density. However, battery materials, especially with high capacity undergo side reactions and changes that result in capacity decay and safety issues. A deep understanding of the reactions that cause changes in the battery's internal components and the mechanisms of those reactions is needed to build safer and better batteries. This review focuses on the processes of battery failures, with voltage and temperature as the underlying factors. Voltage&#8208;induced failures result from anode interfacial reactions, current collector corrosion, cathode interfacial reactions, overcharge, and over&#8208;discharge, while temperature&#8208;induced failure mechanisms include SEI decomposition, separator damage, and interfacial reactions between electrodes and electrolytes. The review also presents protective strategies for controlling these reactions. As a result, the reader is offered a comprehensive overview of the safety features and failure mechanisms of various LIB components.

         <title>Perovskite Colloidal Nanocrystal Solar Cells: Current Advances, Challenges, and Future Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>

The colloidal perovskite nanocrystals (c&#8208;PeNCs) present great potential in the field of solar cells (SCs) owing to its excellent optoelectronic properties. The power conversion efficiency of c&#8208;PeNC SCs (NC&#8208;PeSCs) has surpassed all other colloidal nanocrystal SCs. This article systematically reviews the strategies to make high&#8208;efficiency NC&#8208;PeSCs, discusses the persisting challenges, and provides an outlook for the future of NC&#8208;PeSCs.








Abstract
The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of polycrystalline perovskite (PVK) solar cells (SCs) (PC&#8208;PeSCs) have rapidly increased. However, PC&#8208;PeSCs are intrinsically unstable without encapsulation, and their efficiency drops during large&#8208;scale production; these problems hinder the commercial viability of PeSCs. Stability can be increased by using colloidal PVK nanocrystals (c&#8208;PeNCs), which have high surface strains, low defect density, and exceptional crystal quality. The use of c&#8208;PeNCs separates the crystallization process from the film formation process, which is preponderant in large&#8208;scale fabrication. Consequently, the use of c&#8208;PeNCs has substantial potential to overcome challenges encountered when fabricating PC&#8208;PeSCs. Research on colloidal nanocrystal&#8208;based PVK SCs (NC&#8208;PeSCs) has increased their PCEs to a level greater than those of other quantum&#8208;dot SCs, but has not reached the PCEs of PC&#8208;PeSCs; this inferiority significantly impedes widespread application of NC&#8208;PeSCs. This review first introduces the distinctive properties of c&#8208;PeNCs, then the strategies that have been used to achieve high&#8208;efficiency NC&#8208;PeSCs. Then it discusses in detail the persisting challenges in this domain. Specifically, the major challenges and solutions for NC&#8208;PeSCs related to low short&#8208;circuit current density Jsc are covered. Last, the article presents a perspective on future research directions and potential applications in the realm of NC&#8208;PeSCs.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the latest advancements in work function&#8208;guided electrocatalyst design for diverse electrochemical energy applications are comprehensively analyzed. The development of work function&#8208;based catalytic activity descriptors is discussed. The work function&#8208;regulated interfacial electron transfer for monolithic and heterostructural catalyst design is fully illustrated. Future research opportunities in the development of work function&#8208;guided efficient catalyst design are presented.








Abstract
The development of high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts for energy conversion reactions is crucial for advancing global energy sustainability. The design of catalysts based on their electronic properties (e.g., work function) has gained significant attention recently. Although numerous reviews on electrocatalysis have been provided, no such reports on work function&#8208;guided electrocatalyst design are available. Herein, a comprehensive summary of the latest advancements in work function&#8208;guided electrocatalyst design for diverse electrochemical energy applications is provided. This includes the development of work function&#8208;based catalytic activity descriptors, and the design of both monolithic and heterostructural catalysts. The measurement of work function is first discussed and the applications of work function&#8208;based catalytic activity descriptors for various reactions are fully analyzed. Subsequently, the work function&#8208;regulated material&#8208;electrolyte interfacial electron transfer (IET) is employed for monolithic catalyst design, and methods for regulating the work function and optimizing the catalytic performance of catalysts are discussed. In addition, key strategies for tuning the work function&#8208;governed material&#8208;material IET in heterostructural catalyst design are examined. Finally, perspectives on work function determination, work function&#8208;based activity descriptors, and catalyst design are put forward to guide future research. This work paves the way to the work function&#8208;guided rational design of efficient electrocatalysts for sustainable energy applications.

         <title>Electron Spectroscopy and Microscopy: A Window into the Surface Electronic Properties of Polycrystalline Metal Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The perspective presents an overview of the array of information that can be gleaned from the characterization of single crystals of metal halide perovskites using electron spectroscopic techniques. Building on this information, the perspective then discusses the challenges that need to be addressed in order to extend these versatile techniques to include the highly heterogeneous polycrystalline perovskite thin films.








Abstract
In the past years, an increasing number of experimental techniques have emerged to address the need to unveil the chemical, structural, and electronic properties of perovskite thin films with high vertical and lateral spatial resolutions. One of these is angle&#8208;resolved photoemission electron spectroscopy which can provide direct access to the electronic band structure of perovskites, with the aim of overcoming elusive and controversial information due to the complex data interpretation of purely optical spectroscopic techniques. This perspective looks at the information that can be gleaned from the direct measurement of the electronic band structure of single crystal perovskites and the challenges that remain to be&#160;overcame to extend this technique to heterogeneous polycrystalline metal halide perovskites.

         <title>Stable Photo&#8208;Rechargeable Al Battery for Enhancing Energy Utilization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable photo&#8208;rechargeable Al battery for integrated solar energy conversion storage is demonstrated to substantially enhance energy utilization. Illumination will generate photo&#8208;holes and electrons to improve the reaction pathway, along with boosting the electrochemical reaction. A novel strategy is designed to meet the practical operation condition within 24&#160;h, exhibiting energy saving because of decreased overpotential upon charging/discharging.









Abstract
Photovoltaic cells (PVs) are able to convert solar energy to electric energy, while energy storage devices are required to be equipped due to the fluctuations of sunlight. However, the electrical connection of PVs and energy storage devices leads to increased energy consumption, and thus energy storage ability and utilization efficiency are decreased. One of the solutions is to explore an integrated photoelectrochemical energy conversion&#8208;storage device. Up to date, the integrated photo&#8208;rechargeable Li&#8208;ion batteries often suffer from unstable photo&#8208;active materials and flammable electrolytes under illumination, with concerns in safety risks and limited lifetime. To address the critical issues, here a novel photo&#8208;rechargeable aluminum battery (PRAB) is designed with safe ionic liquid electrolytes and stable polyaniline photo&#8208;electrodes. The integrated PRAB presents stable operation with an enhanced reversible specific capacity &#8776;191% under illumination. Meanwhile, a simplified continuum model is established to provide rational guidance for designing electrode structures along with a charging/discharging strategy to meet the practical operation conditions. The as&#8208;designed PRAB presents an energy&#8208;saving efficiency &#8776;61.92% upon charging and an energy output increment &#8776;31.25% during discharging under illumination. The strategy of designing and fabricating stable and safe photo&#8208;rechargeable non&#8208;aqueous Al batteries highlights the pathway for substantially promoting the utilization efficiency of solar energy.

         <title>50&#8208;nm Gas&#8208;Filled Protein Nanostructures to Enable the Access of Lymphatic Cells by Ultrasound Technologies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The large size of microbubbles and nanobubbles greatly limits the cell populations that ultrasound imaging and delivery can access. This article introduces genetically engineered virus&#8208;size gaseous nanostructures, representing the smallest stable, free&#8208;floating bubbles ever made to the best of the authors&#8217; knowledge. They have demonstrated the ability to penetrate deep tissues in lymph nodes.








Abstract
Ultrasound imaging and ultrasound&#8208;mediated gene and drug delivery are rapidly advancing diagnostic and therapeutic methods; however, their use is often limited by the need for microbubbles, which cannot transverse many biological barriers due to their large size. Here, the authors introduce 50&#8208;nm gas&#8208;filled protein nanostructures derived from genetically engineered gas vesicles(GVs)&#160;that are referred to as 50 nmGVs. These diamond&#8208;shaped nanostructures have hydrodynamic diameters smaller than commercially available 50&#8208;nm gold nanoparticles and are, to the authors&#8217; knowledge, the smallest stable, free&#8208;floating bubbles made to date. 50 nmGVs can be produced in bacteria, purified through centrifugation, and remain stable for months. Interstitially injected 50 nmGVs can extravasate into lymphatic tissues and gain access to critical immune cell populations, and electron microscopy images of lymph node tissues reveal their subcellular location in antigen&#8208;presenting cells adjacent to lymphocytes. The authors anticipate that 50 nmGVs can substantially broaden the range of cells accessible to current ultrasound technologies and may generate applications beyond biomedicine as ultrasmall stable gas&#8208;filled nanomaterials.

These diamond-shaped nanostructures have hydrodynamic diameters smaller than commercially available 50-nm gold nanoparticles and are, to the authors&#8217; knowledge, the smallest stable, free-floating bubbles made to date. &lt;sub&gt;50 nm&lt;/sub&gt;GVs can be produced in bacteria, purified through centrifugation, and remain stable for months. Interstitially injected &lt;sub&gt;50 nm&lt;/sub&gt;GVs can extravasate into lymphatic tissues and gain access to critical immune cell populations, and electron microscopy images of lymph node tissues reveal their subcellular location in antigen-presenting cells adjacent to lymphocytes. The authors anticipate that &lt;sub&gt;50 nm&lt;/sub&gt;GVs can substantially broaden the range of cells accessible to current ultrasound technologies and may generate applications beyond biomedicine as ultrasmall stable gas-filled nanomaterials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Composition Dictates Octahedral Tilt and Photostability in Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The long&#8208;term instability of halide perovskite semiconductors hinders their commercial adoption. In this paper, it is found that the magnitude of octahedral tilting in the crystal structures of alloyed formamidinium&#8208;rich halide perovskites can be controlled by their composition, and that greater tilting leads to more photo&#8208;stable films with fewer performance&#8208;limiting hexagonal phase impurities.








Abstract
Halide perovskites are excellent candidate materials for use in solar cell, LED, and detector devices, in part because their composition can be tuned to achieve ideal optoelectronic properties. Empirical efficiency optimization has led the field toward compositions rich in FA (formamidinium) on the A&#8208;site and I on the X&#8208;site, with additional small amounts of MA (methylammonium) or Cs A&#8208;site cations and Br X&#8208;site anions. However, it is not clear how and why the specific compositions of alloyed, that is, mixed component, halide perovskites relate to photo&#8208;stability of the materials. Here, this work combines synchrotron grazing incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, photoluminescence, high&#8208;resolution scanning electron diffraction measurements and theoretical modelling to reveal the links between material structure and photostability. Namely, this work finds that increased octahedral titling leads to improved photo&#8208;stability that is correlated with lower densities of performance&#8208;harming hexagonal polytype impurities. These results uncover the structural signatures underpinning photo&#8208;stability and can therefore be used to make targeted changes to halide perovskites, bettering the commercial prospects of technologies based on these materials.

         <title>Ultrasound&#8208;Responsive Aligned Piezoelectric Nanofibers Derived Hydrogel Conduits for Peripheral Nerve Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aligned piezoelectric nanofibers derived hydrogel nerve guidance conduits for peripheral nerve regeneration are proposed. The aligned piezoelectric nanofibers inner layer possesses aligned orientation and US&#8208;triggered electrical stimulation, while poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) hybrid hydrogel outer layer provides controllable drug release to promote nerve regeneration. Such conduits can positively accelerate the functional recovery and nerve regeneration of rats with long sciatic nerve defects.








Abstract
Nerve guidance conduits (NGCs) are considered as promising treatment strategy and frontier trend for peripheral nerve regeneration, while their therapeutic outcomes are limited by the lack of controllable drug delivery and available physicochemical cues. Herein, novel aligned piezoelectric nanofibers derived hydrogel NGCs with ultrasound (US)&#8208;triggered electrical stimulation (ES) and controllable drug release for repairing peripheral nerve injury are proposed. The inner layer of the NGCs is the barium titanate piezoelectric nanoparticles (BTNPs)&#8208;doped polyvinylidene fluoride&#8208;trifluoroethylene [BTNPs/P(VDF&#8208;TrFE)] electrospinning nanofibers with improved piezoelectricity and aligned orientation. The outer side of the NGCs is the thermoresponsive poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) hybrid hydrogel with bioactive drug encapsulation. Such NGCs can not only induce neuronal&#8208;oriented extension and promote neurite outgrowth with US&#8208;triggered wireless ES, but also realize the controllable nerve growth factor release with the hydrogel shrinkage under US&#8208;triggered heating. Thus, the NGC can positively accelerate the functional recovery and nerve axonal regeneration of rat models with long sciatic nerve defects. It is believed that the proposed US&#8208;responsive aligned piezoelectric nanofibers derived hydrogel NGCs will find important applications in clinic neural tissue engineering.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Crystalline Core&#8208;Shell Guanine Spherulites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique architecture of core&#8208;shell spherulites, composed of highly birefringent and ordered crystalline organic subunits, formed in the eyes of aquatic organisms, exhibits extraordinary light scattering properties with no synthetic equivalent. A ternary emulsification process is developed to produce bioinspired core&#8208;shell spherulites of self&#8208;assembled guanine platelets, with an estimated birefringence of &#8776;25%.








Abstract
Spherical particles with diameters within the wavelength of visible light, known as spherulites, manipulate light uniquely due to their spatial organization and their structural birefringence. Most of the known crystalline spherulites are branched, and composed of metals, alloys, and semi&#8208;crystalline polymers. Recently, a different spherulite architecture is discovered in the vision systems of decapod crustaceans &#8208; core&#8208;shell spherulites composed of highly birefringent (&#916;n&#8776;30%$\Delta n \approx \ 30\%$) organic single&#8208;crystal platelets, with exceptional optical properties. These metastructures, which efficiently scatter light even in dense aqueous environments, have no synthetic equivalence and serve as a natural proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept as well as synthetic inspiration for thin scattering media. Here, the synthesis of core&#8208;shell spherulites composed of guanine crystal platelets ((&#916;n&#8776;25%$\Delta n \approx 25\%$) is presented in a two&#8208;step emulsification process in which a water/oil/water emulsion and induced pH changes are used to promote interfacial crystallization. Carboxylic acids neutralize the dissolved guanine salts to form spherulites composed of single, radially stacked, &#946;&#8208;guanine platelets, which are oriented tangentially to the spherulite surface. Using Mie theory calculations and forward scattering measurements from single spherulites, it is found that due to the single&#8208;crystal properties and orientation, the synthetic spherulites possess a high tangential refractive index, similarly to biogenic&#160;particles.

         <title>Photoannealing of Microtissues Creates High&#8208;Density Capillary Network Containing Living Matter in a Volumetric&#8208;Independent Manner</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Clinical translation of engineered tissues is currently hindered by the lack of solutions to engineer high&#8208;density capillary networks in clinically sized tissues. Photoannealing of living microtissues combines the clinically translatable microtissue production throughput of in&#8208;air microfluidics with cytocompatible photoannealing to on&#8208;demand generate living microporous tissues containing high&#8208;density capillary networks in a scalable manner.








Abstract
The vascular tree is crucial for the survival and function of large living tissues. Despite breakthroughs in 3D bioprinting to endow engineered tissues with large blood vessels, there is currently no approach to engineer high&#8208;density capillary networks into living tissues in a scalable manner. Here, photoannealing of living microtissue (PALM) is presented as a scalable strategy to engineer capillary&#8208;rich tissues. Specifically, in&#8208;air microfluidics is used to produce living microtissues composed of cell&#8208;laden microgels in ultrahigh throughput, which can be photoannealed into a monolithic living matter. Annealed microtissues inherently give rise to an open and interconnected pore network within the resulting living matter. Interestingly, utilizing soft microgels enables microgel deformation, which leads to the uniform formation of capillary&#8208;sized pores. Importantly, the ultrahigh throughput nature underlying the microtissue formation uniquely facilitates scalable production of living tissues of clinically relevant sizes (&gt;1 cm3) with an integrated high&#8208;density capillary network. In short, PALM generates monolithic, microporous, modular tissues that meet the previously unsolved need for large engineered tissues containing high&#8208;density vascular networks, which is anticipated to advance the fields of engineered organs, regenerative medicine, and drug screening.

         <title>Accumulation of Long&#8208;Lived Photogenerated Holes at Indium Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts via Two Coordinate Nitrogen Vacancy Defect Engineering for Enhanced Photocatalytic Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, a novel method employing defect&#8208;engineered indium (In) single&#8208;atom photocatalysts with nitrogen vacancy (Nv) defects, dispersed in carbon nitride foam (In&#8208;Nv&#8208;CNF), is reported to make further advances in visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalysis. The engineered two coordinated nitrogen (N2C) vacancies induce a defect state serving as an effective electron trap, thus extending the lifetime of photogenerated holes and concentrating holes at In atom sites.








Abstract
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalytic oxidation by photogenerated holes has immense potential for environmental remediation applications. While the electron&#8208;mediated photoreduction reactions are often at the spotlight, active holes possess a remarkable oxidation capacity that can degrade recalcitrant organic pollutants, resulting in nontoxic byproducts. However, the random charge transfer and rapid recombination of electron&#8211;hole pairs hinder the accumulation of long&#8208;lived holes at the reaction center. Herein, a novel method employing defect&#8208;engineered indium (In) single&#8208;atom photocatalysts with nitrogen vacancy (Nv) defects, dispersed in carbon nitride foam (In&#8208;Nv&#8208;CNF), is reported to overcome these challenges and make further advances in photocatalysis. This Nv defect&#8208;engineered strategy produces a remarkable extension in the lifetime and an increase in the concentration of photogenerated holes in In&#8208;Nv&#8208;CNF. Consequently, the optimized In&#8208;Nv&#8208;CNF demonstrates a remarkable 50&#8208;fold increase in photo&#8208;oxidative degradation rate compared to pristine CN, effectively breaking down two widely used antibiotics (tetracycline and ciprofloxacin) under visible light. The contaminated water treated by In&#8208;Nv&#8208;CNF is completely nontoxic based on the growth of Escherichia coli. Structural&#8211;performance correlations between defect engineering and long&#8208;lived hole accumulation in In&#8208;Nv&#8208;CNF are established and validated through experimental and theoretical agreement. This work has the potential to elevate the efficiency of overall photocatalytic reactions from a hole&#8208;centric standpoint.

         <title>Enhancing the Conductivity and Thermoelectric Performance of Semicrystalline Conducting Polymers through Controlled Tie Chain Incorporation</title>

A new model system of ion&#8208;exchange doped, aligned ribbon&#8208;phase poly[2,5&#8208;bis(3&#8208;dodecylthiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene] (PBTTT) is reported to study the effect of controlled incorporation of tie chains between crystalline domains. The tie chains provide efficient transport pathways between crystalline domains, resulting in&#160;enhanced electrical conductivity of 4810.1 S cm&#8722;1 without a reduction in Seebeck coefficient nor a large increase in thermal conductivity.








Abstract
Conjugated polymers are promising materials for thermoelectric applications, however, at present few effective and well&#8208;understood strategies exist to further advance their thermoelectric performance. Here a new model system is reported for a better understanding of the key factors governing their thermoelectric properties: aligned, ribbon&#8208;phase poly[2,5&#8208;bis(3&#8208;dodecylthiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene] (PBTTT) doped by ion&#8208;exchange doping. Using a range of microstructural and spectroscopic methods, the effect of controlled incorporation of tie&#8208;chains between the crystalline domains is studied through blending of high and low molecular weight chains. The tie chains provide efficient transport pathways between crystalline domains and lead to significantly enhanced electrical conductivity of 4810 S cm&#8722;1, which is not accompanied by a reduction in Seebeck coefficient or a large increase in thermal conductivity. Respectable power factors of 173 &#181;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2 are demonstrated in this model system. The approach is generally applicable to a wide range of semicrystalline conjugated polymers and could provide an effective pathway for further enhancing their thermoelectric properties and overcome traditional trade&#8208;offs in optimization of thermoelectric performance.

         <title>Self&#8208;Timed and Spatially Targeted Delivery of Chemical Cargo by Motile Liquid Crystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Programmed hydrodynamic and colloidal forces permit motile liquid crystal (LC) droplets to transport and then release microcargo at specific times and locations. Release is triggered by an internal flow that is weak enough to permit the formation of large microcargo clusters, yet strong enough to exert hydrodynamic forces on these clusters that overcome colloidal forces and trigger escape of the LC droplets.








Abstract
A key challenge underlying the design of miniature machines is encoding materials with time&#8208; and space&#8208;specific functional behaviors that require little human intervention. Dissipative processes that drive materials beyond equilibrium and evolve continuously with time and location represent one promising strategy to achieve such complex functions. This work reports how internal nonequilibrium states of liquid crystal (LC) emulsion droplets undergoing chemotaxis can be used to time the delivery of a chemical agent to a targeted location. During ballistic motion, hydrodynamic shear forces dominate LC elastic interactions, dispersing microdroplet inclusions (microcargo) within double emulsion droplets. Scale&#8208;dependent colloidal forces then hinder the escape of dispersed microcargo from the propelling droplet. Upon arrival at the targeted location, a circulatory flow of diminished strength allows the microcargo to cluster within the LC elastic environment such that hydrodynamic forces grow to exceed colloidal forces and thus trigger the escape of the microcargo. This work illustrates the utility of the approach by using microcargo that initiate polymerization upon release through the outer interface of the carrier droplet. These findings provide a platform that utilizes nonequilibrium strategies to design autonomous spatial and temporal functions into active materials.

         <title>AMPLON: Amplifying DNA with Multiarm Priming and Looping Optimization of Nucleic Acid</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The article introduces a groundbreaking method called amplifying DNA with multiarm priming and looping optimization of nucleic acid (AMPLON) for efficient DNA amplification under isothermal conditions. By utilizing unique multiarm polyethylene glycol&#8211;DNA primers, AMPLON demonstrates high sensitivity and specificity in nucleic acid detection. With its potential to enhance nucleic acid amplification, AMPLON holds promise for significant advancements in biotechnology, medicine and healthcare.








Abstract
Nucleic acid amplification, the bedrock of biotechnology and molecular diagnostics, surges in applications&#8212;especially isothermal approaches&#8212;heightening the demand for advanced and precisely engineered methods. Here, a novel approach for amplifying DNA with multiarm priming and looping optimization of nucleic acid (AMPLON) is presented. AMPLON relies on a novel polymeric material with unique set of multiarm polyethylene glycol&#8211;DNA primers for efficient DNA amplification under isothermal conditions. Each arm carries single&#8208;stranded DNA complementing the sense or antisense sequence of the target DNA. The amplification reaction begins with antisense arms binding to the target DNA, forming a template for sense&#8208;carrying arms to direct multiarm large DNA amplicon synthesis through successive DNA looping and unlooping steps. Using human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV&#8208;1) as a model clinical target, AMPLON exhibits high sensitivity, detecting target concentrations as low as 100 copies mL&#8722;1. Compared to a quantitative real&#8208;time polymerase chain reaction assay using sensitive primers, AMPLON reliably identifies HIV&#8208;1 RNA in plasma samples (n = 20) with a significant agreement rate of 95%. With its ability to achieve highly specific and sensitive target amplification within 30 min, AMPLON holds immense potential to transform the field of nucleic acid research and unleashing new possibilities in medicine and biotechnology.

         <title>Extraordinary Thermoelectric Properties of Topological Surface States in Quantum&#8208;Confined Cd3As2 Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermoelectric properties of topological Dirac semimetal Cd3As2 thin films with varying thicknesses are systematically studied. Significant enhancement of the Seebeck coefficient in quantum&#8208;confined thin films at cryogenic temperatures is observed, which is attributed to the contribution of topological surface states. The findings suggest promising applications of topological thermoelectric materials in cryogenic solid&#8208;state cooling.








Abstract
Topological insulators and semimetals have been shown to possess intriguing thermoelectric properties promising for energy harvesting and cooling applications. However, thermoelectric transport associated with the Fermi arc topological surface states on topological Dirac semimetals remains less explored. This work systematically examines thermoelectric transport in a series of topological Dirac semimetal Cd3As2 thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy.

&lt;p&gt;Thermoelectric properties of topological Dirac semimetal Cd&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;As&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; thin films with varying thicknesses are systematically studied. Significant enhancement of the Seebeck coefficient in quantum-confined thin films at cryogenic temperatures is observed, which is attributed to the contribution of topological surface states. The findings suggest promising applications of topological thermoelectric materials in cryogenic solid-state cooling.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topological insulators and semimetals have been shown to possess intriguing thermoelectric properties promising for energy harvesting and cooling applications. However, thermoelectric transport associated with the Fermi arc topological surface states on topological Dirac semimetals remains less explored. This work systematically examines thermoelectric transport in a series of topological Dirac semimetal Cd&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;As&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. Surprisingly, significantly enhanced Seebeck effect and anomalous Nernst effect are found at cryogenic temperatures when the Cd&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;As&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; layer is thin. In particular, a peak Seebeck coefficient of nearly 500&#160;&#181;V&#160;K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a corresponding thermoelectric power factor over 30&#160;mW&#160;K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; are observed at 5&#160;K in a 25-nm-thick sample. Combining angle-dependent quantum oscillation analysis, magnetothermoelectric measurement, transport modeling, and first-principles simulation, the contributions from bulk and surface conducting channels are isolated and the unusual thermoelectric properties are attributed to the topological surface states. The analysis showcases the rich thermoelectric transport physics in quantum-confined topological Dirac semimetal thin films and suggests new routes to achieving high thermoelectric performance at cryogenic&#160;temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mismatched Supramolecular Interactions Facilitate the Reprocessing of Super&#8208;Strong and Ultratough Thermoset Elastomers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired strategy for improving the recyclability of mechanically strong and tough thermoset elastomers is developed using mismatched supramolecular interactions to molecularly engineer the covalently cross&#8208;linked polymer network. This work produces a robust elastomer with an extraordinary multirecyclability comparable to thermoplastic materials. This work presents a novel pathway for enabling the sustainable recycling of extremely durable thermosets.








Abstract
Thermoset elastomers have been extensively applied in many fields because of their excellent mechanical strengths and durable characteristics, such as an excellent chemical resistance. However, in the context of environmental issues, the nonrecyclability of thermosets has become a major barrier to the further development of these materials. Here, a well&#8208;tailored strategy is reported to solve this problem by introducing mismatched supramolecular interactions (MMSIs) into a covalently cross&#8208;linked poly(urethane&#8208;urea) network with dynamic acylsemicarbazide moieties. The MMSIs significantly strengthen and toughen the thermoset elastomer by effectively dissipating energy and resisting external stress. In addition, the elastomer recycling efficiency is improved 2.7&#8208;fold due to the superior reversibility of the MMSIs. The optimized thermoset elastomer&#160;features outstanding characteristics, including an ultrahigh tensile strength (110.8&#160;MPa), an unprecedented tensile toughness (1245.2&#160;MJ m&#8722;3), as well as remarkable resistance to chemical media, creep, and damage. Most importantly, it exhibits an extraordinary multirecyclability, and the 4th recycling efficiency remains close to 100%. This scalable method promotes the development of thermosets with both high performance and excellent recyclability, thereby providing valuable guidance for addressing the issue of nonrecyclability from a molecular design standpoint.

Abstract
The first tunable nano&#8208;bending structures of [1]rotaxane containing a single&#8208;fluorophoric N,N&#8242;&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;dihydrodibenzo[a,c]phenazine (DPAC) moiety (i.e., [1]RA) are developed as a loosened lasso structure to feature the bright white&#8208;light emission [CIE (0.27, 0.33), &#934; = 21.2%] in THF solution, where bi&#8208;stable states of bending and twisted structures of DPAC unit in [1]RA produce cyan and orange emissions at 480 and 600&#160;nm, respectively. With acid/base controls, tunable loosened/tightened nano&#8208;loops of corresponding [1]rotaxanes (i.e., [1]RA/[1]RB) can be achieved via the shuttling of macrocycles reversibly, and thus to adjust their respective white&#8208;light/cyan emissions, where the cyan emission of [1]RB is obtained due to the largest conformational constraint of DPAC moiety in its bending form of [1]RB with a tightened lasso structure. Additionally, the non&#8208;interlocked analog M&#8208;Boc only shows the orange emission, revealing the twisted form of DPAC fluorophore in M&#8208;Boc without any conformational constraint. Moreover, the utilization of solvents (with different viscosities and polarities), temperatures, and water fractions could serve as effective tools to adjust the bi&#8208;stable vibration&#8208;induced emission (VIE) colors of [1]rotaxanes. Finally, tuning ratiometric emission colors of adaptive conformations of DPAC moieties by altering nano&#8208;bending structures in [1]rotaxanes and external stimuli can be further developed as intelligent temperature and viscosity sensor materials.

         <title>Non&#8208;Equilibrium Assembly of Atomically&#8208;Precise Copper Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically&#8208;precise copper nanoclusters are designed for intricate non&#8208;equilibrium assemblies to create life&#8208;like systems. Cu(I)&#8211;ligand ratio change and dynamic Cu(I)&#8211;Cu(I) metallophilic/coordination interactions enable the reorganization into equilibrium complexes. Upon adding fuels, the system goes further cycles. Metallosupramolecules offer a new toolbox for crafting nuanced non&#8208;equilibrium materials with tailored structures and functionalities.








Abstract
Accurate structure control in dissipative assemblies (DSAs) is vital for precise biological functions. However, accuracy and functionality of artificial DSAs are far from this objective. Herein, a novel approach is introduced by harnessing complex chemical reaction networks rooted in coordination chemistry to create atomically&#8208;precise copper nanoclusters (CuNCs), specifically Cu11(&#181;9&#8208;Cl)(&#181;3&#8208;Cl)3L6Cl (L = 4&#8208;methyl&#8208;piperazine&#8208;1&#8208;carbodithioate). Cu(I)&#8211;ligand ratio change and dynamic Cu(I)&#8211;Cu(I) metallophilic/coordination interactions enable the reorganization of CuNCs into metastable CuL2, finally converting into equilibrium [CuL&#183;Y]Cl (Y = MeCN/H2O) via Cu(I) oxidation/reorganization and ligand exchange process. Upon adding ascorbic acid (AA), the system goes further dissipative cycles. It is observed that the encapsulated/bridging halide ions exert subtle influence on the optical properties of CuNCs and topological changes of polymeric networks when integrating CuNCs as crosslink sites. CuNCs duration/switch period could be controlled by varying the ions, AA concentration, O2 pressure and pH. Cu(I)&#8208;Cu(I) metallophilic and coordination interactions provide a versatile toolbox for designing delicate life&#8208;like materials, paving the way for DSAs with precise structures and functionalities. Furthermore, CuNCs can be employed as modular units within polymers for materials mechanics or functionalization studies.

This work has developed the functional proteinaceous nanoformulation for on&#8208;demand co&#8208;delivery of multiple pharmacological reprogramming factors, which selectively reprogram keratinocytes into myoepithelial cells and achieve de novo regeneration of functional sweat glands in vivo and in situ. This work shows the highest in vivo chemical reprogramming efficiency and offers a transgene&#8208;free and clinically adaptable approach for burn treatment with improved rehabilitation.









Abstract
Sweat gland (SwG) regeneration is crucial for the functional rehabilitation of burn patients. In vivo chemical reprogramming that harnessing the patient's own cells in damaged tissue is of substantial interest to regenerate organs endogenously by pharmacological manipulation, which could compensate for tissue loss in devastating diseases and injuries, for example, burns. However, achieving in vivo chemical reprogramming is challenging due to the low reprogramming efficiency and an unfavorable tissue environment. Herein, this work has developed a functionalized proteinaceous nanoformulation delivery system containing prefabricated epidermal growth factor structure for on&#8208;demand delivery of a cocktail of seven SwG reprogramming components to the dermal site. Such a chemical reprogramming system can efficiently induce the conversion of epidermal keratinocytes&#160;into SwG myoepithelial cells, resulting in successful in situ regeneration of functional SwGs. Notably, in vivo chemical reprogramming of SwGs is achieved for the first time with an impressive efficiency of 30.6%, surpassing previously reported efficiencies. Overall, this proteinaceous nanoformulation provides a platform for coordinating the target delivery of multiple pharmacological agents and facilitating in vivo SwG reprogramming by chemicals. This advancement greatly improves the clinical accessibility of in vivo reprogramming and offers a non&#8208;surgical, non&#8208;viral, and cell&#8208;free strategy for in situ SwG regeneration.

         <title>Phase Evolution of Multi&#8208;Metal Dichalcogenides With Conversion&#8208;Alloying Hybrid Mechanism for Superior Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel multi&#8208;metal dichalcogenide anode, with a conversion&#8208;alloying hybrid mechanism, is introduced in lithium&#8208;ion batteries for the first time. It undergoes a comprehensive phase evolution upon cycling, leading to the formation of abundant heterojunctions and highly conductive metal/alloy phases. This significantly increases lithium storage sites and promotes charge transport, contributing to excellent low&#8208;temperature capability and overall electrochemical performance.









Abstract
Traditional lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) anodes, whether intercalation&#8208;type like graphite or alloying&#8208;type like silicon, employing a single lithium storage mechanism, are often limited by modest capacity or substantial volume changes. Here, the kesterite multi&#8208;metal dichalcogenide (CZTSSe) is introduced as an anode material that harnesses a conversion&#8208;alloying hybrid lithium storage mechanism. Results unveil that during the charge&#8211;discharge processes, the CZTSSe undergoes a comprehensive phase evolution, transitioning from kesterite structure to multiple dominant phases of sulfides, selenides, metals, and alloys. The involvement of multi&#8208;components facilitates electron transport and mitigates swelling stress; meanwhile, it results in formation of abundant defects and heterojunctions, allowing for increased lithium storage active sites and reduced lithium diffusion barrier. The CZTSSe delivers a high specific capacity of up to 2266&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1; while, maintaining a stable output of 116&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 after 10&#160;000 cycles at 20 A g&#8722;1. It also demonstrates remarkable low&#8208;temperature performance, retaining 987&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 even after 600 cycles at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C. When employed in full cells, a high specific energy of 562&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 is achieved, rivalling many state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art LIBs. This research offers valuable insights into the design of LIB electrodes leveraging multiple lithium storage mechanisms.

         <title>Accelerated Engineering of ELP&#8208;Based Materials through Hybrid Biomimetic&#8208;De Novo Predictive Molecular Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a novel hybrid biomimetic design using elastin&#8208;like polypeptides (ELPs), this study accelerates de novo protein material engineering. This work combines computational modeling, deep learning, and genetic engineering to create ELP variants that maintain structural integrity and demonstrate controllable self&#8208;assembly. This method offers a versatile template for the design of novel structural proteins and broadening their applications.








Abstract
Efforts to engineer high&#8208;performance protein&#8208;based materials inspired by nature have mostly focused on altering naturally occurring sequences to confer the desired functionalities, whereas de novo design lags significantly behind and calls for unconventional innovative approaches. Here, using partially disordered elastin&#8208;like polypeptides (ELPs) as initial building blocks this work shows that de novo engineering of protein materials can be accelerated through hybrid biomimetic design, which this work achieves by integrating computational modeling, deep neural network, and recombinant DNA technology. This generalizable approach involves incorporating a series of de novo&#8208;designed sequences with &#945;&#8208;helical conformation and genetically encoding them into biologically inspired intrinsically disordered repeating motifs. The new ELP variants maintain structural conformation and showed tunable supramolecular self&#8208;assembly out of thermal equilibrium with phase behavior in vitro. This work illustrates the effective translation of the predicted molecular designs in structural and functional materials. The proposed methodology can be applied to a broad range of partially disordered biomacromolecules and potentially pave the way toward the discovery of novel structural proteins.

         <title>Single&#8208;Step Control of Liquid&#8211;Liquid Crystalline Phase Separation by Depletion Gradients</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different sizes of nanoparticles with concentration gradients control the liquid&#8211;liquid crystalline phase separation (LLCPS) speed and induce different morphologies of tactoids with positional order. Nanoparticles can be templated by LLCPS via size selectivity effects inside and on the surface of tactoids, enabling unprecedented spatial characterization of the structure of the tactoids.








Abstract
Fine&#8208;tuning nucleation and growth of colloidal liquid crystalline (LC) droplets, also known as tactoids, is highly desirable in both fundamental science and technological applications. However, the tactoid structure results from the trade&#8208;off between thermodynamics and nonequilibrium kinetics effects, and controlling liquid&#8211;liquid crystalline phase separation (LLCPS) in these systems is still a work in progress. Here, a single&#8208;step strategy is introduced to obtain a rich palette of morphologies for tactoids formed via nucleation and growth within an initially isotropic phase exposed to a gradient of depletants. The simultaneous appearance is shown of rich LC structures along the depleting potential gradient, where the position of each LC structure is correlated with the magnitude of the depleting potential. Changing the size (nanoparticles) or the nature (polymers) of the depleting agent provides additional, precise control over the resulting LC structures through a size&#8208;selective mechanism, where the depletant may be found both within and outside the LC droplets. The use of depletion gradients from depletants of varying sizes and nature offers a powerful toolbox for manipulation, templating, imaging, and understanding heterogeneous colloidal LC structures.

         <title>Seeding Atomic Silver into Internal Lattice Sites of Transition Metal Oxide for Advanced Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates how the internal lattice sites of transition metal oxide, more specifically, MnO2, can be utilized for efficient electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) by accommodating atomic Ag catalysts within its sub&#8208;nanoscale tunnel space. A dual&#8208;form Ag catalyst featuring faceted Ag nanoparticles on MnO2 surface and atomic Ag strings within MnO2 tunnels is thus designed with high eCO2RR performance.








Abstract
Transition metal oxides (TMOs) are widely studied for loading of various catalysts due to their low cost and high structure flexibility. However, the prevailing close&#8208;packed nature of most TMOs crystals has restricted the available loading sites to surface only, while their internal bulk lattice remains unactuated due to the inaccessible narrow space that blocks out most key reactants and/or particulate catalysts. Herein, using tunnel&#8208;structured MnO2, this study demonstrates how TMO's internal lattice space can be activated as extra loading sites for atomic Ag in addition to the conventional surface&#8208;only loading, via which a dual&#8208;form Ag catalyst within MnO2 skeleton is established. In this design, not only faceted Ag nanoparticles are confined onto MnO2 surface by coherent lattice&#8208;sharing, Ag atomic strings are also seeded deep into the sub&#8208;nanoscale MnO2 tunnel lattice, enriching the catalytically active sites. Tested for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR), such dual&#8208;form catalyst exhibits a high Faradaic efficiency (94%), yield (67.3&#160;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) and durability (&#8776;48&#160;h) for CO production, exceeding commercial Ag nanoparticles and most Ag&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Theoretical calculations further reveal the concurrent effect of such dual&#8208;form catalyst featuring facet&#8208;dependent eCO2RR for Ag nanoparticles and lattice&#8208;confined eCO2RR for Ag atomic strings, inspiring the future design of catalyst&#8211;substrate configuration.

&lt;p&gt;Transition metal oxides (TMOs) are widely studied for loading of various catalysts due to their low cost and high structure flexibility. However, the prevailing close-packed nature of most TMOs crystals has restricted the available loading sites to surface only, while their internal bulk lattice remains unactuated due to the inaccessible narrow space that blocks out most key reactants and/or particulate catalysts. Herein, using tunnel-structured MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, this study demonstrates how TMO's internal lattice space can be activated as extra loading sites for atomic Ag in addition to the conventional surface-only loading, via which a dual-form Ag catalyst within MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; skeleton is established. In this design, not only faceted Ag nanoparticles are confined onto MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; surface by coherent lattice-sharing, Ag atomic strings are also seeded deep into the sub-nanoscale MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; tunnel lattice, enriching the catalytically active sites. Tested for electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction (eCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR), such dual-form catalyst exhibits a high Faradaic efficiency (94%), yield (67.3&#160;mol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and durability (&#8776;48&#160;h) for CO production, exceeding commercial Ag nanoparticles and most Ag-based electrocatalysts. Theoretical calculations further reveal the concurrent effect of such dual-form catalyst featuring facet-dependent eCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR for Ag nanoparticles and lattice-confined eCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR for Ag atomic strings, inspiring the future design of catalyst&#8211;substrate configuration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Vacancy&#8208;Driven High&#8208;Performance Metabolic Assay for Diagnosis and Therapeutic Evaluation of Depression</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance platform based on vacancy&#8208;engineered Co3O4 for rapid diagnosis and therapeutic evaluation of depression is developed. The vacancy&#8208;engineered nanoparticles enable up to 20&#8208;fold signal amplification compared to commercial products, featured by superior photoelectric response and photothermal properties. This platform achieves superior diagnostic performance for depression (AUC: 0.941&#8211;0.980; Accuracy: 92%&#8722;94%), driving progress in advanced matrices toward precision medicine.








Abstract
Depression is one of the most common mental illnesses and is a well&#8208;known risk factor for suicide, characterized by low overall efficacy (&lt;50%) and high relapse rate (40%). A rapid and objective approach for screening and prognosis of depression is highly desirable but still awaits further development. Herein, a high&#8208;performance metabolite&#8208;based assay to aid the diagnosis and therapeutic evaluation of depression by developing a vacancy&#8208;engineered cobalt oxide (Vo&#8208;Co3O4) assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometer platform is presented. The easy&#8208;prepared nanoparticles with optimal vacancy achieve a considerable signal enhancement, characterized by favorable charge transfer and increased photothermal conversion. The optimized Vo&#8208;Co3O4 allows for a direct and robust record of plasma metabolic fingerprints (PMFs). Through machine learning of PMFs, high&#8208;performance depression diagnosis is achieved, with the areas under the curve (AUC) of 0.941&#8211;0.980 and an accuracy of over 92%. Furthermore, a simplified diagnostic panel for depression is established, with a desirable AUC value of 0.933. Finally, proline levels are quantified in a follow&#8208;up cohort of depressive patients, highlighting the potential of metabolite quantification in the therapeutic evaluation of depression. This work promotes the progression of advanced matrixes and brings insights into the management of depression.

         <title>Deep Learning Prediction of Triplet&#8211;Triplet Annihilation Parameters in Blue Fluorescent Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An advanced triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation (TTA) decay model is implemented and deep learning (DL) model for the prediction of kinetic coefficients is developed using the new TTA model, which DL model presented superior predictability by obtaining determination coefficient value of 0.992 and 0.999 of the TTA rate coefficient and TTA ratio.








Abstract
The triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation (TTA) ratio and the rate coefficient (kTT) of TTA are key factors in estimating the contribution of triplet excitons to radiative singlet excitons in fluorescent TTA organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. In this study, deep learning models are implemented to predict key factors from transient electroluminescence (trEL) data using new numerical equations. A new TTA model is developed that considers both polaron and exciton dynamics, enabling the distinction between prompt and delayed singlet decays with a fundamental understanding of the mechanism. In addition, deep learning models for predicting the kinetic coefficients and TTA ratio are established. After comprehensive optimization inspired by photophysics, determination coefficient values of 0.992 and 0.999 are achieved in the prediction of kTT and TTA ratio, respectively, indicating a nearly perfect prediction. The contribution of each kinetic parameter of polaron and exciton dynamics to the trEL curve is discussed using various deep&#8208;learning models.

         <title>Venus Flytrap&#8208;Inspired Data&#8208;Center&#8208;Free Fast&#8208;Responsive Soft Robots Enabled by 2D Ni3(HITP)2 MOF and Graphite</title>

         <dc:description>
Inspired by Venus flytraps, soft robots without data centers, capable of active stimuli sensing, computing, and reacting, are presented, based on a power modulation strategy. This robot achieves mechanoelectrical transduction through Ni3(2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexaiminotriphenylene)2 (Ni3(HITP)2) metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) with an ultralow time delay (256&#160;ns) and Joule&#8208;heating&#8208;effect&#8208;based graphite electromechanical actuation. Soft robots with symmetrical reacting and asymmetrical reacting are also created.








Abstract
The rapid and responsive capabilities of soft robots in perceiving, assessing, and reacting to environmental stimuli are highly valuable. However, many existing soft robots, designed to mimic humans and other higher animals, often rely on data centers for the modulation of mechanoelectrical transduction and electromechanical actuation. This reliance significantly increases system complexity and time delays. Herein, drawing inspiration from Venus flytraps, a soft robot employing a power modulation strategy is presented for active stimulus reaction, eliminating the need for a data center. This robot achieves mechanoelectrical transduction through Ni3(2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexaiminotriphenylene)2 (Ni3(HITP)2) metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) with an ultralow time delay (256&#160;ns) and electromechanical actuation via graphite. The Joule heating effect in graphite is effectively modulated by Ni3(HITP)2 before and after the presence of pressure, thus enabling the stimulus reaction of soft robots. As demonstrated, three soft robots are created: low&#8208;level edge tongue robots, Venus flytrap robots, and high&#8208;level nerve&#8208;center&#8208;controlled dragonfly robots. This power modulation strategy inspires designs of edge soft robots and high&#8208;level robots with a human&#8208;like effective fusion of conditioned and unconditioned reflexes.

         <title>Double&#8208;Layered Hollow Mesoporous Cuprous Oxide Nanoparticles for Double Drug Sequential Therapy of Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To overcome the resistance of traditional tumor therapies resulting from cancer stem cells (CSCs), a strategy of double drug sequential therapy, i.e., one drug for differentiation therapy of CSCs and another drug for subsequent traditional therapy of non&#8208;CSCs, was proposed&#160;and then realized based on double&#8208;layered hollow mesoporous cuprous oxide nanoparticles in this study.








Abstract
Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are one of the determinants of tumor heterogeneity and are characterized by self&#8208;renewal, high tumorigenicity, invasiveness, and resistance to various therapies. To overcome the resistance of traditional tumor therapies resulting from CSCs, a strategy of double drug sequential therapy (DDST) for CSC&#8208;enriched tumors is proposed in this study and is realized utilizing the developed double&#8208;layered hollow mesoporous cuprous oxide nanoparticles (DL&#8208;HMCONs). The high drug&#8208;loading contents of camptothecin (CPT) and all&#8208;trans retinoic acid (ATRA) demonstrate that the DL&#8208;HMCON can be used as a generic drug delivery system. ATRA and CPT can be sequentially loaded in and released from CPT3@ATRA3@DL&#8208;HMCON@HA. The DDST mechanisms of CPT3@ATRA3@DL&#8208;HMCON@HA for CSC&#8208;containing tumors are demonstrated as follows: 1) the first release of ATRA from the outer layer induces differentiation from CSCs with high drug resistance to non&#8208;CSCs with low drug resistance; 2) the second release of CPT from the inner layer causes apoptosis of non&#8208;CSCs; and 3) the third release of Cu+ from DL&#8208;HMCON itself triggers the Fenton&#8208;like reaction and glutathione depletion, resulting in ferroptosis of non&#8208;CSCs. This CPT3@ATRA3@DL&#8208;HMCON@HA is verified to possess high DDST efficacy for CSC&#8208;enriched tumors with high biosafety.

The DDST mechanisms of CPT3@ATRA3@DL-HMCON@HA for CSC-containing tumors are demonstrated as follows: 1) the first release of ATRA from the outer layer induces differentiation from CSCs with high drug resistance to non-CSCs with low drug resistance; 2) the second release of CPT from the inner layer causes apoptosis of non-CSCs; and 3) the third release of Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; from DL-HMCON itself triggers the Fenton-like reaction and glutathione depletion, resulting in ferroptosis of non-CSCs. This CPT3@ATRA3@DL-HMCON@HA is verified to possess high DDST efficacy for CSC-enriched tumors with high biosafety.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>2D Free&#8208;Standing GeS1&#8722;xSex with Composition&#8208;Tunable Bandgap for Tailored Polarimetric Optoelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The free&#8208;standing GeS1&#8722;xSex nanoplates are grown by low&#8208;pressure rapid physical vapor deposition (LPRPVD). Tailored polarimetric optoelectronic properties of GeS1&#8722;xSex&#8208;based devices are achieved under the modulation of composition&#8208;dependent electronic band structure. These results verify that free&#8208;standing GeS1&#8722;xSex nanoplates possess promising potential in tailored polarimetric optoelectronics and type&#8208;III heterostructure phototransistors with tunable electrical properties.








Abstract
Germanium&#8208;based monochalcogenides (i.e., GeS and GeSe) with desirable properties are promising candidates for the development of next&#8208;generation optoelectronic devices. However, they are still stuck with challenges, such as relatively fixed electronic band structure, unconfigurable optoelectronic characteristics, and difficulty in achieving free&#8208;standing growth. Herein, it is demonstrated that two&#8208;dimensional (2D) free&#8208;standing GeS1&#8722;xSex (0 &#8804; x &#8804;&#8201;1) nanoplates can be grown by low&#8208;pressure rapid physical vapor deposition (LPRPVD), fulfilling a continuously composition&#8208;tunable optical bandgap and electronic band structure. By leveraging the synergistic effect of composition&#8208;dependent modulation and free&#8208;standing growth, GeS1&#8722;xSex&#8208;based optoelectronic devices exhibit significantly configurable hole mobility from 6.22 &#215; 10&#8722;4 to 1.24 cm2V&#8722;1s&#8315;1 and tunable responsivity from 8.6 to 311 A&#160;W&#8722;1 (635&#160;nm), as x varies from 0 to 1. Furthermore, the polarimetric sensitivity can be tailored from 4.3 (GeS0.29Se0.71) to 1.8 (GeSe) benefiting from alloy engineering. Finally, the tailored imaging capability is also demonstrated to show the application potential of GeS1&#8722;xSex alloy nanoplates. This work broadens the functionality of conventional binary materials and motivates the development of tailored polarimetric optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Tailoring the Coordination Micro&#8208;Environment in Nanotraps for Efficient Platinum/Palladium Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The precise tailoring of the coordination micro&#8208;environment enables the creation of nanotraps specifically targeting platinum, facilitating the separation of binary platinum group metals (platinum/palladium). This advancement allows for the sequential and convenient acquisition of pure palladium outflow from a binary mixture of platinum and palladium via breakthrough experiments.








Abstract
Recovering platinum group metals from secondary resources is crucial to meet the growing demand for high&#8208;tech applications. Various techniques are explored, and adsorption using porous materials has emerged as a promising technology due to its efficient performance and environmental beingness. However, the challenge lies in effectively recovering and separating individual platinum group metals (PGMs) given their similar chemical properties. Herein, a breakthrough approach is presented by sophisticatedly tailoring the coordination micro&#8208;environment in a series of aminopyridine&#8208;based porous organic polymers, which enables the creation of platinum&#8208;specific nanotraps for efficient separation of binary PGMs (platinum/palladium). The newly synthesized POP&#8208;o2NH2&#8208;Py demonstrates record uptakes and selectivity toward platinum over palladium, with the amino groups adjacent to the pyridine moieties being vital in improving platinum binding performance. Further breakthrough experiments underline its remarkable ability to separate platinum and palladium. Spectroscopic analysis reveals that POP&#8208;o2NH2&#8208;Py offers a more favorable coordination fashion to platinum ions compared to palladium ions owing to the greater interaction between N and Pt4+ and stronger intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the amino groups and four coordinating chlorines at platinum. These findings underscore the importance of fine&#8208;tuning the coordination micro&#8208;environment of nanotraps through subtle modifications that can greatly enhance the selectivity toward the desired metal ions.

         <title>Closed Twisted Hydrogel Ribbons with Self&#8208;Sustained Motions under Static Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of M&#246;bius strip and Seifert ribbon robots are devised by using identical slender muscle&#8208;like anisotropic hydrogel. These closed twisted ribbon hydrogels exhibit continuous flipping and rotation under static light irradiation. The self&#8208;sustainability of hydrogel robots arises from the synergy of fast response of the gel, self&#8208;shadowing effect, and geometry&#8208;facilitated refresh of the light&#8208;exposed regions.








Abstract
Self&#8208;sustained motions are widespread in biological systems by harvesting energy from surrounding environments, which inspire scientists to develop autonomous soft robots. However, most&#8208;existing soft robots require dynamic heterogeneous stimuli or complex fabrication with different components. Recently, control of topological geometry has been promising to afford soft robots with physical intelligence and thus life&#8208;like motions. Reported here are a series of closed twisted ribbon robots, which exhibit self&#8208;sustained flipping and rotation under constant light irradiation. Both M&#246;bius strip and Seifert ribbon robots are devised for the first time by using an identical hydrogel, which responds to light irradiation on either side. Experiment and simulation results indicate that the self&#8208;regulated motions of the hydrogel robots are related to fast and reversible response of muscle&#8208;like gel, self&#8208;shadowing effect, and topology&#8208;facilitated refresh of light&#8208;exposed regions. The motion speeds and directions of the hydrogel robots can be tuned over a wide range. These closed twisted ribbon hydrogels are further applied to execute specific tasks in aqueous environments, such as collecting plastic balls, climbing a vertical rod, and transporting objects. This work presents new design principle for autonomous hydrogel robots by benefiting from material response and topology geometry, which may be inspirative for the robotics community.

         <title>Sensitized Triplet&#8211;Triplet Annihilation in Nanostructured Polymeric Scintillators Allows for Pulse Shape Discrimination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanostructured polymer scintillators embedding liquid nanodomains where triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation dye capable and a triplet sensitizer are dissolved allow discriminating &#945;&#160;particles, neutrons, and &#947;&#8208;rays with a better time response than commercial scintillators.








Abstract
Scintillating materials emit light when exposed to ionizing radiation or particles and are used for the detection of nuclear threats, medical imaging, high&#8208;energy physics, and other usages. For some of these applications, it is vital to distinguish neutrons and charged particles from &#947;&#8208;rays. This is achievable by pulse shape discrimination (PSD), a time&#8208;gated technique, which exploits that the scintillation kinetics can depend on the nature of the incident radiation. However, it proves difficult to realize efficient PSD with plastic scintillators, which have several advantages over liquid or crystalline scintillating materials, including mechanical robustness and shapeability. It is shown here that sensitive and rapid PSD is possible with nanostructured polymer scintillators that consist of a solid polymer matrix and liquid nanodomains in which an organic dye capable of triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation (TTA) is dissolved. The liquid nature of the nanodomains renders TTA highly efficient so that delayed fluorescence can occur at low energy density. The nanostructured polymer scintillators allow discriminating &#945; particles, neutrons, and &#947;&#8208;rays with a time response that is better than that of commercial scintillators. Exploiting that the liquid nanodomains can facilitate energy transfer processes otherwise difficult to realize in solid polymers, an auxiliary triplet sensitizer is incorporated. This approach further increases the scintillator's sensitivity toward &#945; particles and neutrons and other high&#8208;energy processes where localized interactions are involved.

         <title>Formation of 2D Amorphous Lithium Sulfide Enabled by Mo2C Clusters Loaded Carbon Scaffold for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel concept of trending a shift in the configuration of lithium sulfide toward an amorphous structure is first proposed by using a leaf&#8208;like carbon scaffold (LCS) with the modification of Mo2C cluster (Mo2C@LCS) as a sulfur host. It is revealed that the formation of amorphous lithium sulfides shows significantly improved kinetics for lithium sulfides deposition and decomposition.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries, operated through the interconversion between sulfur and solid&#8208;state lithium sulfide, are regarded as next&#8208;generation energy storage systems. However, the sluggish kinetics of lithium sulfide deposition/dissolution, caused by its insoluble and insulated nature, hampers the practical use of Li&#8208;S batteries. Herein, leaf&#8208;like carbon scaffold (LCS) with the modification of Mo2C clusters (Mo2C@LCS) is reported as host material of sulfur powder. During cycles, the dissociative Mo ions at the Mo2C@LCS/electrolyte interface are detected to exhibit competitive binding energy with Li ions for lithium sulfide anions, which disrupts the deposition behavior of crystalline lithium sulfide and trends a shift in the configuration of lithium sulfide toward an amorphous structure. Combining the related electrochemical study and first&#8208;principle calculation, it is revealed that the formation of amorphous lithium sulfides shows significantly improved kinetics for lithium sulfide deposition and decomposition. As a result, the obtained Mo2C@LCS/S cathode shows an ultralow capacity decay rate of 0.015% per cycle at a high mass loading of 9.5&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 after 700 cycles. More strikingly, an ultrahigh sulfur loading of 61.2&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 can also be achieved. This work defines an efficacious strategy to advance the commercialization of Mo2C@LCS host for Li&#8208;S batteries.

         <title>Polarization Saturation in Multilayered Interfacial Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates that rhombohedral layers of binary compounds exhibit polarization saturation beyond a critical stack thickness. The underlying saturation mechanism points to a purely electronic redistribution involving bandgap closure that allows for cross&#8208;stack charge transfer and the emergence of free surface charge. The findings, which are of general nature, should be accounted for when designing switching and/or conductive devices based on ferroelectric layered materials.








Abstract
Van der Waals polytypes of broken inversion and mirror symmetries &#160;have been recently shown to exhibit switchable electric polarization even at the ultimate two&#8208;layer thin limit. Their out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization has been found to accumulate in a ladder&#8208;like fashion with each successive layer, offering 2D building blocks for the bottom&#8208;up construction of 3D ferroelectrics. Here, it is demonstrated experimentally that beyond a critical stack thickness, the accumulated polarization in rhombohedral polytypes of molybdenum disulfide saturates. The underlying saturation mechanism, deciphered via density functional theory and self&#8208;consistent Poisson&#8211;Schr&#246;dinger calculations, point to a purely electronic redistribution involving: 1.&#160;Polarization&#8208;induced bandgap closure that allows for cross&#8208;stack charge transfer and the emergence of free surface charge; 2. Reduction of the polarization saturation value, as well as the critical thickness at which it is obtained, by the presence of free carriers. The resilience of polar layered structures to atomic surface reconstruction, which is essentially unavoidable in polar 3D crystals, potentially allows for the design of new devices with mobile surface charges. The findings, which are of general nature, should be accounted for when designing switching and/or conductive devices based on ferroelectric layered materials.

         <title>Phase&#8208;Centric MOCVD Enabled Synthetic Approaches for Wafer&#8208;Scale 2D Tin Selenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
With phase&#8208;tailored synthetic strategies, wafer&#8208;scale production of tin selenides in the 2D limit is achieved via a low&#8208;temperature metal&#8208;organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) process. Directly grown 2D&#8208;SnSe2 exhibits outstanding crystallinity and tunable thickness, and SnSe, which has intrinsic limitations for 2D film growth, can be prepared via a phase transition, thereby retaining all of the advantages in the MOCVD&#8208;grown product.








Abstract
Following an initial nucleation stage at the flake level, atomically thin film growth of a van der Waals material is promoted by ultrafast lateral growth and prohibited vertical growth. To produce these highly anisotropic films, synthetic or post&#8208;synthetic modifications are required, or even a combination of both, to ensure large&#8208;area, pure&#8208;phase, and low&#8208;temperature deposition. A set of synthetic strategies is hereby presented to selectively produce wafer&#8208;scale tin selenides, SnSex (both x&#160;=&#160;1 and 2), in the 2D forms. The 2D&#8208;SnSe2 films with tuneable thicknesses are directly grown via metal&#8211;organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) at 200&#160;&#176;C, and they exhibit outstanding crystallinities and phase homogeneities and consistent film thickness across the entire wafer. This is enabled by excellent control of the volatile metal&#8211;organic precursors and decoupled dual&#8208;temperature regimes for high&#8208;temperature ligand cracking and low&#8208;temperature growth. In contrast, SnSe, which intrinsically inhibited from 2D growth, is indirectly prepared by a thermally driven phase transition of an as&#8208;grown 2D&#8208;SnSe2 film with all the benefits of the MOCVD technique. It is accompanied by the electronic n&#8208;type to p&#8208;type crossover at the wafer scale. These tailor&#8208;made synthetic routes will accelerate the low&#8208;thermal&#8208;budget production of multiphase 2D materials in a reliable and scalable fashion.

         <title>Strong Interaction between Titanium Carbonitride Embedded in Mesoporous Carbon Nanofibers and Pt Enables Durable Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Titanium carbonitride embedded in mesoporous carbon nanofibers (m&#8208;TiCN NFs) are developed as alternative support materials for electrochemical reactions. Benefiting from internal interpenetrating conductive pathways within the one&#8208;dimensional m&#8208;TiCN NFs and the strong interaction between m&#8208;TiCN NFs and platinum (Pt), m&#8208;TiCN NFs&#8208;supported Pt catalysts show superior durability in both rotating disk electrode and fuel cell tests.








Abstract
Platinum (Pt) supported on high surface area carbon has been the most widely used electrocatalyst in proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). However, conventional carbon supports are susceptible to corrosion at high potentials, leading to severe degradation of electrochemical performance. In this work, titanium carbonitride embedded in mesoporous carbon nanofibers (m&#8208;TiCN NFs) are reported as a promising alternative to address this issue. Benefiting from the interpenetrating conductive pathways inside the one&#8208;dimensional (1D) nanostructures and the embedded TiCN nanoparticles (NPs), m&#8208;TiCN NFs exhibit excellent stability at high potentials and interact strongly with Pt NPs. Subsequently, m&#8208;TiCN NFs&#8208;supported Pt NPs deliver remarkably enhanced oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and durability, with negligible activity decay and less than 5% loss of electrochemical surface area&#65288;ECSA&#65289; after 50&#160;000 cycles. Moreover, the fuel cell assembled by this catalyst delivers a maximum power density of 1.22&#160;W cm&#8722;2 and merely 3% loss after 30&#160;000 cycles of accelerated durability tests under U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) protocols. The improved ORR activity and durability are attributed to the superior corrosion resistance of the m&#8208;TiCN NF support and the strong interaction between Pt and m&#8208;TiCN NFs.

         <title>Triboelectric Basalt Textiles Efficiently Operating within an Ultrawide Temperature Range</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a thermally stabilized triboelectric basalt textile capable of operating in an ultra&#8208;wide temperature range of &#8722;196&#160;&#176;C to 520&#160;&#176;C. Applications of wearable extreme temperature alarms and self&#8208;powered temperature recognition are demonstrated under extreme cold and hot environments, showing their possible use in high and low latitudes, high altitudes, deserts, and even space settings.








Abstract
With the continuous upsurge in demand for wearable energy, nanogenerators are increasingly required to operate under extreme environmental conditions. Even though they are at the cutting edge of technology, nanogenerators have difficulty producing high&#8208;quality electrical output at very extreme temperatures. Here, a triboelectric basalt textile (TBT) with an ultrawide operational temperature range (from &#8722;196 to 520&#160;&#176;C) is created employing basalt material as the main body. The output power density of the TBT, in contrast to most conventional nanogenerators, would counterintuitively rise by 2.3 times to 740.6&#160;mW m&#8722;2 after heating to 100&#160;&#176;C because the high temperature will enhance the material's interface polarization and electronic kinetic energy. The TBT retains &#8776;55% of its initial electrical output even after heating in the flame of an alcohol lamp (520&#160;&#176;C). Surprisingly, the TBTs output voltage may retain over 85% of its initial value even after submerging in liquid nitrogen. The TBTs exceptional resistance to heat and cold indicates its possible use in high and low latitudes, high altitudes, deserts, and even space settings.

         <title>Bisphosphonate&#8208;Anchored Self&#8208;Assembled Molecules with Larger Dipole Moments for Efficient Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells with Excellent Stability</title>

         <dc:description>
In order to obtain self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) with good wettability, adsorbability, and compactness, three bisphosphonate&#8208;anchored indolocarbazole (IDCz)&#8208;derived SAMs are designed and synthesized with different dipole moments, namely IDCz&#8208;1, IDCz&#8208;2, and IDCz&#8208;3. The inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) employing IDCz&#8208;3 as hole&#8208;collecting layer exhibited a champion PCE of 25.15%, which is a record efficiency for PSCs based on multipodal SAMs.








Abstract
In the fabrication of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the wettability, adsorbability, and compactness of self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) on conductive substrates have critical impacts on the quality of the perovskite films and the defects at the buried perovskite&#8208;substrate interface, which control the efficiency and stability of the devices. Herein, three bisphosphonate&#8208;anchored indolocarbazole (IDCz)&#8208;derived SAMs, IDCz&#8208;1, IDCz&#8208;2, and IDCz&#8208;3, are designed and synthesized by modulating the position of the two nitrogen atoms of the IDCz unit to improve the molecular dipole moments and strengthen the &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. Regulating the work functions (WF) of FTO electrodes through molecular dipole moments and energy levels, the perovskite band bends upwards with a small offset for ITO/IDCz&#8208;3/perovskite, thereby promoting hole extraction and blocking electrons. As a result, the inverted PSC employing IDCz&#8208;3 as hole&#8208;collecting layer exhibits a champion PCE of 25.15%, which is a record efficiency for the multipodal SAMs&#8208;based PSCs. Moreover, the unencapsulated device with IDCz&#8208;3 can be stored for at least 1800 h with little degradation in performance.

         <title>Inhibiting Residual Solvent Induced Side Reactions in Vinylidene Fluoride&#8208;Based Polymer Electrolytes Enables Ultra&#8208;Stable Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The side reactions by the residual solvents of VDF&#8208;based SPE with the lithium (Li) metal induce poor stability, which has been long neglected. In this study, a strategy is developed to suppress the side interfacial reactions between the residual solvent and electrodes using a fluorinated solvent, FDMA, for a PVHF&#8208;based SPE. This study offers valuable insights into developing advanced VDF&#8208;based SPEs for enhanced lithium metal battery performance and longevity.








Abstract
Residual solvents in vinylidene fluoride (VDF)&#8208;based solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) have been recognized as responsible for their high ionic conductivity. However, side reactions by the residual solvents with the lithium (Li) metal induce poor stability, which has been long neglected. This study proposes a strategy to achieve a delicate equilibrium between ion conduction and electrode stability for VDF&#8208;based SPEs. Specifically, 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;N,N&#8208;dimethylacetamide (FDMA) is developed as the nonside reaction solvent for poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) (PVHF)&#8208;based SPEs, achieving both high ionic conductivity and significantly improved electrochemical stability. The developed FDMA solvent fosters the formation of a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) through interface reactions with Li metal, effectively mitigating side reactions and dendrite growth on the Li metal electrode. Consequently, the Li||Li symmetric cells and Li||LiFePO4 cells demonstrate excellent cycling performance, even under limited Li (20&#160;&#181;m thick) supply and high&#8208;loading cathodes (&gt;10&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, capacity &gt;1 mAh cm&#8722;2) conditions. The stable Li||LiCoO2 cells operation with a cutoff voltage of 4.48&#160;V indicates the high&#8208;voltage stability of the developed SPE. This study offers valuable insights into the development of advanced VDF&#8208;based SPEs for enhanced lithium metal battery performance and longevity.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Mode Hydrogels with Structural and Fluorescent Colors toward Multistage Secure Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rigid self&#8208;assembled lamellar structures provide restricted domains wherein flexible hydrogels are interspersed to form structural color. The introduction of fluorescent monomer as a complex site coordinates with lanthanide metal ions resulting multiple fluorescent colors. This resultant dual&#8208;mode hydrogel with both independently tunable structural and fluorescent colors has the potential to be used as multistage information encryption.








Abstract
Constructing an anti&#8208;counterfeiting material with non&#8208;interference dual optical modes is an effective way to improve information security. However, it remains challenging to achieve multistage secure information encryption due to the limited stimulus responsiveness and color tunability of the current dual&#8208;mode materials. Herein, a dual&#8208;mode hydrogel with both independently tunable structural and fluorescent colors toward multistage information encryption, is reported. In this hydrogel system, the rigid lamellar structure of poly(dodecylglyceryl itaconate) (pDGI) formed by shear flow&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly provides the restricted domains wherein monomers undergo polymerization to form a hydrogel network, producing structural color. The introduction of fluorescent monomer 6&#8208;acrylamidopicolinate (6APA) as a complexation site provides the possibility of fluorescent color formation. The hydrogel's angle&#8208;dependent structural color can be controlled by adjusting the crosslinking density and water content. Additionally, the fluorescence color can be modulated by adjusting the ratio of lanthanide ions. Information of dual&#8208;mode can be displayed separately in different channels and synergistically overlayed to read the ultimate message. Thus, a multistage information encryption system based on this hydrogel is devised through the programed decryption process. This strategy holds tremendous potential as a platform for encrypting and safeguarding valuable and authentic information in the field of anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the GSL extension to 2D metagratings for manipulating waves within 3D space is studied. Through this analysis, a series of holograms generated by dual&#8208;layer acoustic metagratings is experimentally demonstrated.

Metasurface holograms represent a common category of metasurface devices that utilize in&#8208;plane phase gradients to shape wavefronts, forming holographic images through the application of the generalized Snell's law (GSL). While conventional metasurfaces focus solely on phase gradients, metagratings, which incorporate higher&#8208;order wave diffraction, further expand the GSL's generality. Recent advances in certain acoustic metagratings demonstrate an updated GSL extension capable of reversing anomalous transmission and reflection, whose reversal is characterized by the parity of the number of wave propagation trips through the metagrating. However, the current extension of GSL remains limited to 1D metagratings, unable to access 2D holographic images in 3D spaces. Here, the GSL extension to 2D metagratings for manipulating waves within 3D spaces is investigated. Through this analysis, a series of acoustic metagrating holograms is experimentally demonstrated. These holographic images exhibit the unique ability to switch between transmission and reflection types independently. This study introduces an additional dimension to modern holography design and metasurface wavefront manipulation.

         <title>Construction of Co&#8211;Se&#8211;W at Interfaces of Phase&#8208;Mixed Cobalt Selenide via Spontaneous Phase Transition for Platinum&#8208;Like Hydrogen Evolution Activity and Long&#8208;Term Durability in Alkaline and Acidic Media</title>

W doping induces a spontaneous phase transition from stable phase cubic CoSe2 (c&#8208;CoSe2) to metastable phase orthorhombic CoSe2. The nanoflower&#8208;shaped W&#8208;doped cubic/orthorhombic phase&#8208;mixed CoSe2 catalyst benefits from Co&#8211;Se&#8211;W active species formed on the c&#8208;CoSe2 side of the phase interface and abundant phase interfaces, exhibiting Pt&#8208;like HER activity and outstanding stability in both alkaline and acidic media.








Abstract
Cost&#8208;effective transition metal chalcogenides are highly promising electrocatalysts for both alkaline and acidic hydrogen evolution reactions (HER). However, unsatisfactory HER kinetics and stability have severely hindered their applications in industrial water electrolysis. Herein, a nanoflowers&#8208;shaped W&#8208;doped cubic/orthorhombic phase&#8208;mixed CoSe2 catalyst ((c/o)&#8208;CoSe2&#8208;W) is reported. The W doping induces spontaneous phase transition from stable phase cubic CoSe2 (c&#8208;CoSe2) to metastable phase orthorhombic CoSe2, which not only enables precise regulation of the ratio of two phases but also realizes W doping at the interfaces of two phases. The (c/o)&#8208;CoSe2&#8208;W catalyst exhibits a Pt&#8208;like HER activity in both alkaline and acidic media, with record&#8208;low HER overpotentials of 29.8&#160;mV (alkaline) and 35.9&#160;mV (acidic) at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, respectively, surpassing the vast majority of previously reported non&#8208;precious metal electrocatalysts for both alkaline and acidic HER. The Pt&#8208;like HER activities originate from the formation of Co&#8211;Se&#8211;W active species on the c&#8208;CoSe2 side at the phase interface, which effectively modulates electron structures of active sites, not only enhancing H2O adsorption and dissociation at Co sites but also optimizing H* adsorption to &#916;GH*&#160;&#8776;&#160;0 at W sites. Benefiting from the abundant phase interfaces, the catalyst also displays outstanding long&#8208;term durability in both acidic and alkaline media.

         <title>Co&#8208;Assembled Nanoparticles toward Multi&#8208;Target Combinational Therapy of Alzheimer's Disease by Making Full Use of Molecular Recognition and Self&#8208;Assembly</title>

         <dc:description>
Herein a novel supramolecular integration strategy based on molecular recognition and self&#8208;assembly is proposed for the multi&#8208;target combinational therapy of Alzheimer's disease, and its feasibility and tunability are validated taking the combination of &#946;&#8208;amyloid fibrillization and oxidative stress as the representative in this work, which provides a convenient platform for constructing such multifunctional integrated system toward complex disease treatment.








Abstract
The complex pathologies in Alzheimer's disease (AD) severely limit the effectiveness of single&#8208;target pharmic interventions, thus necessitating multi&#8208;pronged therapeutic strategies. While flexibility is essentially demanded in constructing such multi&#8208;target systems, for achieving optimal synergies and also accommodating the inherent heterogeneity within AD. Utilizing the dynamic reversibility of supramolecular strategy for conferring sufficient tunability in component substitution and proportion adjustment, amphiphilic calixarenes are poised to be a privileged molecular tool for facilely achieving function integration. Herein, taking &#946;&#8208;amyloid (A&#946;) fibrillation and oxidative stress as model combination pattern, a supramolecular multifunctional integration is proposed by co&#8208;assembling guanidinium&#8208;modified calixarene with ascorbyl palmitate and loading dipotassium phytate within calixarene cavity. Serial pivotal events can be simultaneously addressed by this versatile system, including 1) inhibition of A&#946; production and aggregation, 2) disintegration of A&#946; fibrils, 3) acceleration of A&#946; metabolic clearance, and 4) regulation of oxidative stress, which is verified to significantly ameliorate the cognitive impairment of 5&#215;FAD mice, with reduced A&#946; plaque content, neuroinflammation, and neuronal apoptosis. Confronted with the extremely intricate clinical realities of AD, the strategy presented here exhibits ample adaptability for necessary alterations on combinations, thereby may immensely expedite the advancement of AD combinational therapy through providing an exceptionally convenient platform.

         <title>Multilaminate Energy Storage Films from Entropy&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Assembled Supramolecular Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Entropy&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly empowers the creation of highly ordered lamellar organic&#8211;inorganic supramolecular nanocomposite films, which display remarkably enhanced performance compared to unstructured composites when employed for electrostatic energy storage. This work highlights the central role of oriented nanoparticle&#8208;rich lamella in manipulating dielectric properties and electrostatic energy storage performance, offering a design concept for exploiting high&#8208;energy&#8208;density polymer nanocomposite films.








Abstract
Composite materials comprising polymers and inorganic nanoparticles (NPs) are promising for energy storage applications, though challenges in controlling NP dispersion often result in performance bottlenecks. Realizing nanocomposites with controlled NP locations and distributions within polymer microdomains is highly desirable for improving energy storage capabilities but is a persistent challenge, impeding the in&#8208;depth understanding of the structure&#8211;performance relationship. In this study, a facile entropy&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly approach is employed to fabricate block copolymer&#8208;based supramolecular nanocomposite films with highly ordered lamellar structures, which are then used in electrostatic film capacitors. The oriented interfacial barriers and well&#8208;distributed inorganic NPs within the self&#8208;assembled multilaminate nanocomposites effectively suppress leakage current and mitigate the risk of breakdown, showing superior dielectric strength compared to their disordered counterparts. Consequently, the lamellar nanocomposite films with optimized composition exhibit high energy efficiency (&gt;90% at 650&#160;MV&#160;m&#8722;1), along with remarkable energy density and power density. Moreover, finite element simulations and statistical modeling have provided theoretical insights into the impact of the lamellar structure on electrical conduction, electric field distribution, and electrical tree propagation. This work marks a significant advancement in the design of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrids for energy storage, establishing a well&#8208;defined correlation between microstructure and performance.

         <title>Donor&#8211;Acceptor Modulating of Ionic AIE Photosensitizers for Enhanced ROS Generation and NIR&#8208;II Emission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aggregation induced emission photosensitizer, DTP&#8208;In, is constructed with strong dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;d]pyrrole (DTP) donor and indolium (In) acceptor, achieving redshift in absorption and emission wavelength and enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation rate simultaneously. DTP&#8208;In can self&#8208;assemble into positively charged nanoaggregates in aqueous solutions and specifically target to the mitochondria, leading to enhanced photodynamic therapy effect under 660 nm laser irradiation.








Abstract
Photosensitizers (PSs) with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristics are competitive candidates for bioimaging and therapeutic applications. However, their short emission wavelength and nonspecific organelle targeting hinder their therapeutic effectiveness.

&lt;p&gt;An aggregation induced emission photosensitizer, DTP-In, is constructed with strong dithieno[3,2-b:2&#8242;,3&#8242;-d]pyrrole (DTP) donor and indolium (In) acceptor, achieving redshift in absorption and emission wavelength and enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation rate simultaneously. DTP-In can self-assemble into positively charged nanoaggregates in aqueous solutions and specifically target to the mitochondria, leading to enhanced photodynamic therapy effect under 660 nm laser irradiation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photosensitizers (PSs) with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) characteristics are competitive candidates for bioimaging and therapeutic applications. However, their short emission wavelength and nonspecific organelle targeting hinder their therapeutic effectiveness. Herein, a donor&#8211;acceptor modulation approach is reported to construct a series of ionic AIE photosensitizers with enhanced photodynamic therapy (PDT) outcomes and fluorescent emission in the second near-infrared (NIR-II) window. By employing dithieno[3,2-b:2&#8242;,3&#8242;-d]pyrrole (DTP) and indolium (In) as the strong donor and acceptor, respectively, the compound DTP-In exhibits a substantial redshift in absorption and fluorescent emission reach to NIR-II region. The reduced energy gap between singlet and triplet states in DTP-In also increases the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation rate. Further, DTP-In can self-assemble in aqueous solutions, forming positively charged nanoaggregates, which are superior to conventional encapsulated nanoparticles in cellular uptake and mitochondrial targeting. Consequently, DTP-In aggregates show efficient photodynamic ablation of 4T1 cancer cells and outstanding tumor theranostic in vivo under 660&#160;nm laser irradiation.

         <title>Crack&#8208;Resistant and Tissue&#8208;Like Artificial Muscles with Low Temperature Activation and High Power Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial muscle combining crack&#8208;resistance (fracture energy of 33&#8239;720 J m&#8722;2 and fatigue threshold of 2250 J m&#8722;2), tissue&#8208;matched modulus (0.7&#160;MPa), low&#8208;temperature activation (40&#160;&#176;C), and high power density (450&#160;W kg&#8722;1) is created by introducing crystallizable segments and ethylene glycol flexible spacer into a liquid crystalline network, where the crystallization and covalent crosslinking density are finely controlled.








Abstract
Constructing soft robotics with safe human&#8211;machine interactions requires low&#8208;modulus, high&#8208;power&#8208;density artificial muscles that are sensitive to gentle stimuli. In addition, the ability to resist crack propagation during long&#8208;term actuation cycles is essential for a long service life. Herein, a material design is proposed to combine all these desirable attributes in a single artificial muscle platform. The design involves the molecular engineering of a liquid crystalline network with crystallizable segments and an ethylene glycol flexible spacer. A high degree of crystallinity can be afforded by utilizing aza&#8208;Michael chemistry to produce a low covalent crosslinking density, resulting in crack&#8208;insensitivity with a high fracture energy of 33&#160;720 J m&#8722;2 and a high fatigue threshold of 2250 J m&#8722;2. Such crack&#8208;resistant artificial muscle with tissue&#8208;matched modulus of 0.7&#160;MPa can generate a high power density of 450&#160;W kg&#8722;1 at a low temperature of 40&#160;&#176;C. Notably, because of the presence of crystalline domains in the actuated state, no crack propagation is observed after 500 heating&#8211;cooling actuation cycles under a static load of 220&#160;kPa. This study points to a pathway for the creation of artificial muscles merging seemingly disparate, but desirable properties, broadening their application potential in smart devices.

         <title>Less is More: Asymmetric D&#8211;A Type Agent to Achieve Dynamic Self&#8208;Assembled Nanoaggregates for Long&#8208;Acting Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic self&#8208;assembled nanoaggregates that can undergo &#8220;sphere&#8208;to&#8208;rod&#8221; process are constructed here by an asymmetric D&#8211;A type TIBT. The nanoaggregates exhibit high tumor&#8208;targeting, prolonged retention, and favored metabolism by a single effort, finally contributing to long&#8208;acting photodynamic therapy treatment with low dose but high inhibition rate to tumors in vivo.








Abstract
To enhance the phototheranostic performance, agents with high reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, good tumor&#8208;targeting ability, and prolonged retention are urgently needed. However, symmetric donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) type agents usually produce spherical nanoaggregates, leading to good tumor targeting but inferior retention. Rod&#8208;like nanoaggregates are desired to extend their retention in tumors; however, this remains a challenge. In particular, agents with dynamically changeable shapes that integrate merits of different morphologies are seldomly reported. Therefore, self&#8208;assembled organic nanoaggregates with smart shape tunability are designed here using an asymmetric D&#8211;A type TIBT. The photoluminescence quantum yield in solids is up to 52.24% for TIBT. TIBT also exhibits high ROS generation in corresponding nanoaggregates (TIBT&#8208;NCs). Moreover, dynamic self&#8208;assembly in shape changing from nanospheres to nanorods occurrs in TIBT&#8208;NCs, contributing to the enhancement of ROS quantum yield from 0.55 to 0.72. In addition, dynamic self&#8208;assembly can be observed for both in vitro and in vivo, conferring TIBT&#8208;NCs with strong tumor targeting and prolonged retention. Finally, efficient photodynamic therapy to inhibit tumor growth is achieved in TIBT&#8208;NCs, with an inhibition rate of 90%. This work demonstrates that asymmetric D&#8211;A type agents can play significant roles in forming self&#8208;assembled organic nanoaggregates, thus showing great potential in long&#8208;acting cancer therapy.

         <title>Distinguishing Elements at the Sub&#8208;Nanometer Scale on the Surface of a High Entropy Alloy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new methodology capable of distinguishing elements on the surface of a high entropy alloy at sub&#8208;nm scale is presented. This is achieved by combining scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and synchrotron radiation in the X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurement. The elemental fingerprints are enabled with the XAS while the spatial resolution is achieved using the STM.








Abstract
Materials in crystalline form possess translational symmetry (TS) when the unit cell is repeated in real space with long&#8208; and short&#8208;range orders. The periodic potential in the crystal regulates the electron wave function and results in unique band structures, which further define the physical properties of the materials. Amorphous materials lack TS due to the randomization of distances and arrangements between atoms, causing the electron wave function to lack a well&#8208;defined momentum. High entropy materials provide another way to break the TS by randomizing the potential strength at periodic atomic sites. The local elemental distribution has a great impact on physical properties in high entropy materials. It is critical to distinguish elements at the sub&#8208;nanometer scale to uncover the correlations between the elemental distribution and the material properties. Here, the use of synchrotron X&#8208;ray scanning tunneling microscopy (SX&#8208;STM) with sub&#8208;nm scale resolution in identifying elements on a high entropy alloy (HEA) surface is demonstrated. By examining the elementally sensitive X&#8208;ray absorption spectra with an STM tip to enhance the spatial resolution, the elemental distribution on an HEA's surface at a sub&#8208;nm scale is extracted. These results open a pathway towards&#160;quantitatively&#160;understanding high entropy materials and their material properties.

         <title>All&#8208;Round Passivation Strategy Yield Flexible Perovskite/CuInGaSe2 Tandem Solar Cells with Efficiency Exceeding 26.5%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exceeding 26.5%&#8208;efficient all flexible Perovskite/CIGS Tandem solar cell is achieved by all&#8208;round passivation strategy termed Dual Passivation at Grains and Interfaces which improve film crystallinity and maximize the passivation of defects at various locations within the solar cell structure, effectively minimizing nonradiative recombination losses.








Abstract
The perovskite/Cu(InGa)Se2 (CIGS) tandem solar cells (TSCs) presents a compelling technological combination poised for the next generation of flexible and lightweight photovoltaic (PV) tandem devices, featuring a tunable bandgap, high power conversion efficiency (PCE), lightweight flexibility, and enhanced stability and durability. Over the years, the imperative to enhance the performance of wide bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has grown significantly, particularly in the context of a flexible tandem device. In this study, an all&#8208;round passivation strategy known as Dual Passivation at Grains and Interfaces (DPGI) is introduced for WBG PSCs in perovskite/CIGS tandem structures. The implementation of DPGI is tailored to improve film crystallinity and passivate defects across the solar cell structure, leading to a substantial performance enhancement for WBG PSCs. Subsequently, both rigid and flexible tandem devices are assembled. Impressively, a fully flexible 4T perovskite/CIGS TSCs is successfully fabricated with a PCE of 26.57%, making it the highest value in this field and highlighting its potential applications in the next generation of flexible lightweight PV tandem devices.

&lt;p&gt;Exceeding 26.5%-efficient all flexible Perovskite/CIGS Tandem solar cell is achieved by all-round passivation strategy termed Dual Passivation at Grains and Interfaces which improve film crystallinity and maximize the passivation of defects at various locations within the solar cell structure, effectively minimizing nonradiative recombination losses.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The perovskite/Cu(InGa)Se&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (CIGS) tandem solar cells (TSCs) presents a compelling technological combination poised for the next generation of flexible and lightweight photovoltaic (PV) tandem devices, featuring a tunable bandgap, high power conversion efficiency (PCE), lightweight flexibility, and enhanced stability and durability. Over the years, the imperative to enhance the performance of wide bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has grown significantly, particularly in the context of a flexible tandem device. In this study, an all-round passivation strategy known as Dual Passivation at Grains and Interfaces (DPGI) is introduced for WBG PSCs in perovskite/CIGS tandem structures. The implementation of DPGI is tailored to improve film crystallinity and passivate defects across the solar cell structure, leading to a substantial performance enhancement for WBG PSCs. Subsequently, both rigid and flexible tandem devices are assembled. Impressively, a fully flexible 4T perovskite/CIGS TSCs is successfully fabricated with a PCE of 26.57%, making it the highest value in this field and highlighting its potential applications in the next generation of flexible lightweight PV tandem devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Optical&#8208;Cavity&#8208;Incorporated Colorful All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Electrochromic Devices for Dual Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new design strategy that is structured around all&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrochromic device is developed to circumvent the critical problem in conventional all&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrochromic device, which offers personalized devices that exhibit vivid structural colors and dual anti&#8208;counterfeiting, accompanied by fast switching responses and excellent cycling performance.








Abstract
The fusion of electrochromic technology with optical resonant cavities presents an intriguing innovation in the electrochromic field. However, this fusion is mainly achieved in liquid electrolyte&#8208;based or sol&#8211;gel electrolyte&#8208;based electrochromic devices, but not in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrochromic devices, which have broader industrial applications. Here, a new all&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrochromic device is demonstrated with a metal&#8211;dielectric&#8211;metal (MDM) resonant cavity, which can achieve strong thin&#8208;film interference effects through resonance, enabling the device to achieve unique structural colors that have rarely appeared in reported all&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrochromic devices, such as yellow green, purple, and light red. The color gamut of the device can be further expanded due to the adjustable optical constants of the electrochromic layer. What is more, this device exhibits remarkable cycling stability (maintaining 84% modulation capability after 7200 cycles), rapid switching time (coloration in 2.6 s and bleaching in 2.8 s), and excellent optical memory effect (only increasing by 13.8% after almost 36&#8239;000 s). In addition, this exquisite structural design has dual&#8208;responsive anti&#8208;counterfeiting effects based on voltage and angle, further demonstrating the powerful color modulation capability of this device.

         <title>Ferromagnetic Order in 2D Layers of Transition Metal Dichlorides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ferromagnetic order at the single layer limit of two van der Waals materials based on transition metal dichlorides is probed. XMCD&#160;measurements demonstrate that the ferromagnetic order of FeCl2 and NiCl2 persist on top of a metallic substrate. LT&#8208;STS&#160;experiments, using functionalized tips with an organic magnetic sensor, confirm the magnetic order of the materials at the atomic scale even at zero applied magnetic fields.








Abstract
Magnetism in two dimensions is traditionally considered an exotic phase mediated by spin fluctuations, but far from collinearly ordered in the ground state. Recently, 2D magnetic states have been discovered in layered van der Waals compounds. Their robust and tunable magnetic state by material composition, combined with reduced dimensionality, foresee a strong potential as a key element in magnetic devices. Here, a class of 2D magnets based on metallic chlorides is presented. The magnetic order survives on top of a metallic substrate, even down to the monolayer limit, and can be switched from perpendicular to in&#8208;plane by substituting the metal ion from iron to nickel. Using functionalized STM tips as magnetic sensors, local exchange fields are identified, even in the absence of an external magnetic field. Since the compounds are processable by molecular beam epitaxy techniques, they provide a platform with large potential for incorporation into current device&#160;technologies.

         <title>Nonlinear Elastic Bottlebrush Polymer Hydrogels Modulate Actomyosin Mediated Protrusion Formation in Mesenchymal Stromal Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonlinear elastic extracellular matrix properties are difficult to recapitulate without the use of fibrous architectures, which couple strain&#8208;stiffening and stress&#8208;relaxation. Herein, bottlebrush polymer hydrogels are used to isolate and tune the strain&#8208;stiffening biomechanical feedback sensed by human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs) in non&#8208;fibrous engineered microenvironments. Nonlinear elastic mechanics induces a protrusion&#8208;rich hMSC phenotype regulated by focal adhesions and actomyosin dynamics.








Abstract
The nonlinear elasticity of many tissue&#8208;specific extracellular matrices is difficult to recapitulate without the use of fibrous architectures, which couple strain&#8208;stiffening with stress relaxation. Herein, bottlebrush polymers are synthesized and crosslinked to form poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;based hydrogels and used to study how strain&#8208;stiffening behavior affects human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs). By tailoring the bottlebrush polymer length, the critical stress associated with the onset of network stiffening is systematically varied, and a unique protrusion&#8208;rich hMSC morphology emerges only at critical stresses within a biologically accessible stress regime. Local cell&#8208;matrix interactions are quantified using 3D traction force microscopy and small molecule inhibitors are used to identify cellular machinery that plays a critical role in hMSC mechanosensing of the engineered, strain&#8208;stiffening microenvironment. Collectively, this study demonstrates how covalently crosslinked bottlebrush polymer hydrogels can recapitulate strain&#8208;stiffening biomechanical cues at biologically relevant stresses and be used to probe how nonlinear elastic matrix properties regulate cellular processes.

         <title>Scalable Approach to Molecular Motor&#8208;Polymer Conjugates for Light&#8208;Driven Artificial Muscles</title>

Controlled polymerization allows scalable access to light&#8208;driven artificial muscles based on molecular motors. A combined experimental and computer simulation framework provides deep insights into how chain conformational aspects and density of active motors influence contraction kinetics and load&#8208;lifting capacity.








Abstract
The integration of molecular machines and motors into materials represents a promising avenue for creating dynamic and functional molecular systems, with potential applications in soft robotics or reconfigurable biomaterials. However, the development of truly scalable and controllable approaches for incorporating molecular motors into polymeric matrices has remained a challenge. Here, it is shown that light&#8208;driven molecular motors with sensitive photo&#8208;isomerizable double bonds can be converted into initiators for Cu&#8208;mediated controlled/living radical polymerization enabling the synthesis of star&#8208;shaped motor&#8208;polymer conjugates. This approach enables scalability, precise control over the molecular structure, block copolymer structures, and high&#8208;end group fidelity. Moreover, it is demonstrated that these materials can be crosslinked to form gels with quasi&#8208;ideal network topology, exhibiting light&#8208;triggered contraction. The influence of arm length and polymer structure is investigated, and the first molecular dynamics simulation framework to gain deeper insights into the contraction processes is developed. Leveraging this scalable methodology, the creation of bilayer soft robotic devices and cargo&#8208;lifting artificial muscles is showcased, highlighting the versatility and potential applications of this advanced polymer chemistry approach. It is anticipated that the integrated experimental and simulation framework will accelerate scalable approaches for active polymer materials based on molecular machines, opening up new horizons in materials science and bioscience.

         <title>Capillarity&#8208;Driven Enrichment and Hydrodynamic Trapping of Trace Nucleic Acids by Plasmonic Cavity Membrane for Rapid and Sensitive Detections</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, a plasmonic cavity membrane that is designed to not only enrich and capture trace nucleic acids in a clinically relevant large sample volume by taking advantage of capillarity and hydrodynamic trapping but also achieve rapid amplification and sensitive detection is reported.








Abstract
Small&#8208;reactor&#8208;based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has attracted considerable attention. A significant number of tiny reactors must be prepared in parallel to capture, amplify, and accurately quantify few target genes in clinically relevant large volume, which, however, requires sophisticated microfabrication and longer sample&#8208;to&#8208;answer time. Here, single plasmonic cavity membrane is reported that not only enriches and captures few nucleic acids by taking advantage of both capillarity and hydrodynamic trapping but also quickly amplifies them for sensitive plasmonic detection. The plasmonic cavity membrane with few nanoliters in a void volume is fabricated by self&#8208;assembling gold nanorods with SiO2 tips. Simulations reveal that hydrodynamic stagnation between the SiO2 tips is mainly responsible for the trapping of the nucleic acid in the membrane. Finally, it is shown that the plasmonic cavity membrane is capable of enriching&#160;severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) genes up to 20&#160;000&#8208;fold within 1&#160;min, amplifying within 3&#160;min, and detecting the trace genes as low as a single copy &#181;L&#8722;1. It is anticipated that this work not only expands the utility of PCR but also provides an innovative way of the enrichment and detection of trace biomolecules in a variety of point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing applications.

         <title>Primary Human Breast Cancer&#8208;Associated Endothelial Cells Favor Interactions with Nanomedicines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tumor blood vessels are barriers for nanomedicines en route to solid tumors. This study indicates that primary human breast tumor&#8208;associated endothelial cells exhibit higher nanoparticle uptake efficiency than normal mammary microvascular endothelial cells, along with an increased number of intracellular vesicles and upregulated transport&#8208;related genes. These findings may advance the development of safer and more effective cancer nanomedicines.








Abstract
Cancer nanomedicines predominately rely on transport processes controlled by tumor&#8208;associated endothelial cells to deliver therapeutic and diagnostic payloads into solid tumors. While the dominant role of this class of endothelial cells for nanoparticle transport and tumor delivery is established in animal models, the translational potential in human cells needs exploration. Using primary human breast cancer as a model, the differential interactions of normal and tumor&#8208;associated endothelial cells with clinically relevant nanomedicine formulations are explored and quantified. Primary human breast cancer&#8208;associated endothelial cells exhibit up to &#8776;2&#160;times higher nanoparticle uptake than normal human mammary microvascular endothelial cells. Super&#8208;resolution imaging studies reveal a significantly higher intracellular vesicle number for tumor&#8208;associated endothelial cells, indicating a substantial increase in cellular transport activities. RNA sequencing and gene expression analysis indicate the upregulation of transport&#8208;related genes, especially motor protein genes, in tumor&#8208;associated endothelial cells. Collectively, the results demonstrate that primary human breast cancer&#8208;associated endothelial cells exhibit enhanced interactions with nanomedicines, suggesting a potentially significant role for these cells&#160;in nanoparticle tumor delivery in human patients. Engineering nanoparticles that leverage the translational potential of tumor&#8208;associated endothelial cell&#8208;mediated transport into human solid tumors may lead to the development of safer and more effective clinical cancer nanomedicines.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Function Electrolyte Additive Design for Long Life Alkaline Zinc Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article demonstrates a dual&#8208;function additive strategy aimed at addressing the capacity loss in alkaline aqueous zinc&#8208;based flow batteries (AZFBs) during long&#8208;duration operations in real&#8208;world applications. This dual&#8208;function additive promotes uniform zinc deposition, slows down corrosion in alkaline environments, and inhibits the formation of dead zinc, thereby enhancing the capacity retention of AZFBs and significantly extending their battery cycling lifespan.








Abstract
Alkaline zinc&#8208;based flow batteries (AZFBs) have emerged as a promising electrochemical energy storage technology owing to Zn abundance, high safety, and low cost. However, zinc dendrite growth and the formation of dead zinc greatly impede the development of AZFBs. Herein, a dual&#8208;function electrolyte additive strategy is proposed to regulate zinc nucleation and mitigate the hydroxide corrosion of zinc depositions for stable AZFBs. This strategy, as exemplified by urea, introduces an electrolyte additive to coordinate with Zn2+/Zn with proper strength, slowing zinc deposition kinetics to induce uniform nucleation and protecting the deposited zinc surface from attack by hydroxide ions through preferable adsorption. The zincate complexes with urea are identified to be Zn(OH)2(urea)(H2O)2 and Zn2(OH)4(H2O)4(urea), which exhibit slow zinc deposition kinetics, allowing instantaneous nucleation. Calculation results reveal an additional energy barrier of 1.29&#160;eV for the subsequent adsorption of an OH&#8722; group when a urea molecule absorbs on the zinc cluster, significantly mitigating the formation of dead zinc. Consequently, prolonged cell cycling of the prototype alkaline zinc&#8208;iron flow battery demonstrates stable operation for over 130 h and an average coulombic efficiency of 98.5%. It is anticipated that this electrolyte additive strategy will pave the way for developing highly stable AZFBs.

         <title>Understanding and Weakening Photon Recycling in Solar Cells to Approach the Radiative Limit</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new photon recycling model is proposed by considering the relationship between photon recycling and radiation processes, as well as the corresponding open&#8208;circuit voltage losses of solar cells. This model reveals that weakening photon recycling is more effective to approach the radiative limit of solar cells than enhancing it, and helps to achieve higher device stability.








Abstract
Photon recycling plays an important role in the light outcoupling of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art solar cells and is considered a necessary condition to achieve the radiative limit of open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) and efficiency. However, due to the impact of photon recycling on bulk and surface radiation of solar cells being overlooked, experimental demonstrations on the accuracy of existing photon recycling models are scarce and some contrary theoretical results also emerge. Here, the relationship between photon recycling and radiation processes, as well as the corresponding VOC losses of solar cells based on the principle of detailed balance is clarified. It is shown that weakening photon recycling is more effective to boost the device performance than enhancing it, promoting the theoretical efficiencies of solar cells, such as perovskite, Si, and GaAs, to 98.5%, 94.9%, and almost 100% of their radiative limit, respectively. Moreover, weakening photon recycling also helps to maintain higher efficiency when the internal radiative efficiency decreases, which benefits higher device stability. This work provides an in&#8208;depth understanding of the role of photon recycling in solar cells and helps to push efficiency to a new limit.

         <title>Defect Engineering for Enhanced Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reaction on Transition Metal Oxides: The Role of Metal Defects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study provides a strategy for regulating metal defects, including theoretical predictions and experimental validation. The activation of octahedral sites facilitates the adsorption of reactants, deprotonation of OH*, and the desorption of reaction products, ultimately leading to the achievement of a highly efficient dual&#8208;function catalyst for ORR and OER.








Abstract
Metal defect engineering is a highly effective strategy for addressing the prevalent high overpotential issues associated with transition metal oxides functioning as dual&#8208;function commercial oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen evolution reaction catalysts for increasing their activity and stability. However, the high formation energy of metal defects poses a challenge to the development of strategies to precisely control the selectivity during metal defect formation. Here, density functional theory calculations are used to demonstrate that altering the pathway of metal defect formation releases metal atoms as metal chlorides, which effectively reduces the formation energy of defects. The metal defects on the monometallic metal oxide surface (Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) are selectively produced using chlorine plasma. The characterization and density functional theory calculations reveal that catalytic activity is enhanced owing to electronic delocalization induced by metal defects, which reduces the theoretical overpotential. Notably, ab initio molecular dynamics calculations, ex situ XPS, and in situ ATR&#8208;SEIRAS suggest that metal defects effectively improve the adsorption of reactive species on active sites and enhance the efficiency of product desorption, thereby boosting catalytic performance.

However, the high formation energy of metal defects poses a challenge to the development of strategies to precisely control the selectivity during metal defect formation. Here, density functional theory calculations are used to demonstrate that altering the pathway of metal defect formation releases metal atoms as metal chlorides, which effectively reduces the formation energy of defects. The metal defects on the monometallic metal oxide surface (Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) are selectively produced using chlorine plasma. The characterization and density functional theory calculations reveal that catalytic activity is enhanced owing to electronic delocalization induced by metal defects, which reduces the theoretical overpotential. Notably, ab initio molecular dynamics calculations, ex situ XPS, and in situ ATR-SEIRAS suggest that metal defects effectively improve the adsorption of reactive species on active sites and enhance the efficiency of product desorption, thereby boosting catalytic performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Truly Tiny Acoustic Biomolecules for Ultrasound Imaging and Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrasmall &#8220;bicones&#8221; are engineered from gas vesicles (GVs), a type of air&#8208;filled protein nanostructure, and produced in bacterial culture. This work develops foundational techniques for their potential applications in ultrasound imaging and therapy, including methods for detection in vitro and in vivo, cavitation, molecular targeting, immune evasion, and protein conjugation.








Abstract
Nanotechnology offers significant advantages for medical imaging and therapy, including enhanced contrast and precision targeting. However, integrating these benefits into ultrasonography is challenging due to the size and stability constraints of conventional bubble&#8208;based agents. Here bicones, truly tiny acoustic contrast agents based on gas vesicles (GVs), a unique class of air&#8208;filled protein nanostructures naturally produced in buoyant microbes, are described. It is shown that these sub&#8208;80&#160;nm particles can be effectively detected both in vitro and in vivo, infiltrate tumors via leaky vasculature, deliver potent mechanical effects through ultrasound&#8208;induced inertial cavitation, and are easily engineered for molecular targeting, prolonged circulation time, and payload conjugation.

         <title>3D Conjugated Hole Transporting Materials for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel 3D hole transporting material termed FTPE&#8208;ST is reported, which has a large conjugated structure leading to high hole mobility, and sulfur atoms that can bind to coordinately unsaturated lead centers on the surface of perovskite films, enhancing interfacial interactions. Perovskite solar cells and modules incorporating FTPE&#8208;ST achieve power conversion efficiencies of 25.21 and 21.27%, respectively.








Abstract
The orthogonal structure of the widely used hole transporting material (HTM) 2,2&#8242;,7,7&#8242;&#8208;tetrakis(N, N&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;methoxyphenylamino)&#8722;9,9&#8242;&#8208;spirobifluorene (Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD)&#160;imparts isotropic conductivity and excellent film&#8208;forming capability. However, inherently weak intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;molecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions result in low intrinsic hole mobility. Herein, a novel HTM, termed FTPE&#8208;ST, with a twist conjugated dibenzo(g,p)chrysene core and coplanar 3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) as extended donor units, is designed to enhance &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, without compromising on solubility. The three&#8208;dimensional (3D) configuration provides the material multi&#8208;direction charge transport as well as excellent solubility even in 2&#8208;methylanisole, and its large conjugated backbone endows the HTM with a high hole mobility. Moreover, the sulfur donors in EDOT units coordinate with lead ions on the perovskite surface, leading to stronger interfacial interactions and the suppression of defects at the perovskite/HTM interface. As a result, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) employing FTPE&#8208;ST achieve a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.21% with excellent long&#8208;time stability, one of the highest PCEs for non&#8208;spiro HTMs in n&#8208;i&#8208;p PSCs. In addition, the excellent film&#8208;forming capacity of the HTM enables the fabrication of FTPE&#8208;ST&#8208;based large&#8208;scale PSCs (1.0&#160;cm2) and modules (29.0&#160;cm2), which achieve PCEs of 24.21% (certificated 24.17%) and 21.27%, respectively.

The metal halide octahedron is regarded as the fundamental structural and functional unit of perovskites. However, the impact of octahedral connectivity in perovskites on device performance is not systematically explored. This manuscript provides direct experimental evidence that the existence of non&#8208;corner&#8208;sharing regions is detrimental to device performance and provides key guidance on how to regulate octahedral connectivity.








Abstract
The metal halide (BX6)4&#8208; octahedron, where B represents a metal cation and X represents a halide anion, is regarded as the fundamental structural and functional unit of metal halide perovskites. However, the influence of the way the (BX6)4&#8722; octahedra connect to each other has on the structural stability and optoelectronic properties of metal halide perovskite is still unclear. Here, the octahedral connectivity, including corner&#8208;, edge&#8208;, and face&#8208;sharing, of various CsxFA1&#8208;xPbI3 (0&#160;&#8804;&#160;x&#160;&#8804;&#160;0.3) perovskite films is tuned and reliably characterized through compositional and additive engineering, and with ultralow&#8208;dose transmission electron microscopy. It is found that the overall solar cell device performance, the charge carrier lifetime, the open&#8208;circuit voltage, and the current density&#8211;voltage hysteresis are all improved when the films consist of corner&#8208;sharing octahedra, and non&#8208;corner sharing phases are suppressed, even in films with the same chemical composition. Additionally, it is found that the structural, optoelectronic, and device performance stabilities are similarly enhanced when non&#8208;corner&#8208;sharing connectivities are suppressed. This approach, combining macroscopic device tests and microscopic material characterization, provides a powerful tool enabling a thorough understanding of the impact of octahedral connectivity on device performance, and opens a new parameter space for designing high&#8208;performance photovoltaic metal halide perovskite devices.

         <title>Single Layer Silk and Cotton Woven Fabrics for Acoustic Emission and Active Sound Suppression</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
When coupled to a piezoelectric fiber, traditional fabrics can serve as emitters or suppressors of sound, emitting sound up to 70&#160;dB or actively reducing noise by up to 37 dB. A 130 &#181;m fabric can also serve as an active barrier to reduce vibrations on the surface of the fabric and thus attenuate transmitted sound by up to 75%.








Abstract
Whether intentionally generating acoustic waves or attempting to mitigate unwanted noise, sound control is an area of challenge and opportunity. This study investigates traditional fabrics as emitters and suppressors of sound. When attached to a single strand of a piezoelectric fiber actuator, a silk fabric emits up to 70&#160;dB of sound. Despite the complex fabric structure, vibrometer measurements reveal behavior reminiscent of a classical thin plate. Fabric pore size relative to the viscous boundary layer thickness is found&#8212;through comparative fabric analysis&#8212;to influence acoustic&#8208;emission efficiency. Sound suppression is demonstrated using two distinct mechanisms. In the first, direct acoustic interference is shown to reduce sound by up to 37 dB. The second relies on pacifying the fabric vibrations by the piezoelectric fiber, reducing the amplitude of vibration waves by 95% and attenuating the transmitted sound by up to 75%. Interestingly, this vibration&#8208;mediated suppression in principle reduces sound in an unlimited volume. It also allows the acoustic reflectivity of the fabric to be dynamically controlled, increasing by up to 68%. The sound emission and suppression efficiency of a 130 &#181;m silk fabric presents opportunities for sound control in a variety of applications ranging from apparel to transportation to architecture.

         <title>A Highly Deficient Medium&#8208;Entropy Perovskite Ceramic for Electromagnetic Interference Shielding under Harsh Environment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly deficient medium&#8208;entropy perovskite ceramic has developed as an efficient electromagnetic interference&#160;shielding material in harsh environment. The high concentration of Ti&#8208;O vacancy clusters formed under the synergistic effect of aliovalent substitution and entropy effect enables the material to serve as an bifunctional shielding material for electromagnetic wave and heat.








Abstract
Materials that can provide reliable electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding in highly oxidative atmosphere at elevated temperature are indispensable in the fast&#8208;developing aerospace field. However, most of conductor&#8208;type EMI shielding materials such as metals can hardly withstand the high&#8208;temperature oxidation, while the conventional dielectric&#8208;type materials cannot offer sufficient shielding efficiency in gigahertz (GHz) frequencies. Here, a highly deficient medium&#8208;entropy (ME) perovskite ceramic as an efficient EMI shielding material in harsh environment, is demonstrated. The synergistic effect of entropy stabilization and aliovalent substitution on A&#8208;site generate abnormally high concentration of Ti and O vacancies that are stable under high&#8208;temperature oxidation. Due to the clustering of vacancies, the highly deficient perovskite ceramic exhibits giant complex permittivity and polarization loss in GHz, leading to the specific EMI shielding effectiveness above 30&#160;dB/mm in X&#8208;band even after 100 h of annealing at 1000&#160;&#176;C in air. Along with the low thermal conductivity, the aliovalent ME perovskite can serve as a bifunctional shielding material for applications in aircraft engines and reusable rockets.

         <title>Nonflammable Succinonitrile&#8208;Based Deep Eutectic Electrolyte for Intrinsically Safe High&#8208;Voltage Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intrinsically safe sodium&#8208;ion battery is realized by the new&#8208;type of nonflammable succinonitrile (SN)&#8208;based deep eutectic electrolyte. The deep eutectic electrolyte with a strong hydrogen bond between S&#9552;O of 1,3,2&#8208;dioxathiolane&#8208;2,2&#8208;dioxide and the &#945;&#8208;H of SN effectively improves the compatibility of SN with Lewis bases.








Abstract
Intrinsically safe sodium&#8208;ion batteries are considered as a promising candidate for large&#8208;scale energy storage systems. However, the high flammability of conventional electrolytes may pose serious safety threats and even explosions. Herein, a strategy of constructing a deep eutectic electrolyte is proposed to boost the safety and electrochemical performance of succinonitrile (SN)&#8208;based electrolyte. The strong hydrogen bond between S&#9552;O of 1,3,2&#8208;dioxathiolane&#8208;2,2&#8208;dioxide (DTD) and the &#945;&#8208;H of SN endows the enhanced safety and compatibility of SN with Lewis bases. Meanwhile, the DTD participates in the inner Na+ sheath and weakens the coordination number of SN. The unique solvation configuration promotes the formation of robust gradient inorganic&#8208;rich electrode&#8211;electrolyte interphase, and merits stable cycling of half&#8208;cells in a wide temperature range, with a capacity retention of 82.8% after 800 cycles (25&#160;&#176;C) and 86.3% after 100 cycles (60&#160;&#176;C). Correspondingly, the full cells deliver tremendous improvement in cycling stability and rate performance.

         <title>Nonpersistent Nanoarchitectures Enhance Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy in an Immunocompetent Orthotopic Model of HPV+ Head/Neck Carcinoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonpersistent nanoarchitectures comprising cluster&#8208;size gold demonstrate, in combination with radiotherapy, an outperforming therapeutic efficacy on orthotopic human papillomavirus&#8208;positive head/neck squamous cell carcinoma immunocompetent murine models. This approach overcomes the clinical limitations associated to metal&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;mediated radiotherapy while enhancing the treatment outcome with respect to the gold standard, opening new horizons in oral cancer management.









Abstract
Cisplatin chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is the established standard of care for managing locally advanced human papillomavirus&#8208;positive head/neck carcinoma. The typically young patients may suffer serious and long&#8208;time side effects caused by the treatment, such as dysphagia, and hearing loss. Thus, ensuring a satisfactory post&#8208;treatment quality of life is paramount. One potential replacing approach to the classical CRT involves the combination of standard&#8208;dose radiotherapy and radiosensitizers such as noble metal nanoparticles (NPs). However, several concerns about size, shape, and biocompatibility limit the translation of metal nanomaterials to the clinical practice. Here, it is demonstrated that a new model of nonpersistent gold nanoarchitectures containing cisplatin (NAs&#8208;Cluster&#8208;CisPt) generates, in combination with radiotherapy, a significant in vivo tumor&#8208;reducing effect compared to the standard CRT, achieving a complete tumor clearance in 25% of the immunocompetent models that persist for 60 days. These findings, together with the negligible amount of metals recognized in the excretory organs, highlight that the concurrent administration of NAs&#8208;Cluster&#8208;CisPt and radiotherapy has the potential to overcome some clinical limitations associated to NP&#8208;based approaches while enhancing the treatment outcome with respect to standard CRT. Overall, despite further mechanistic investigations being essential, these data support the exploiting of nonpersistent metal&#8208;nanomaterial&#8208;mediated approaches for oral cancer management.

A 5.1&#160;&#181;m rigid quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte layer&#160;constructed by tough Kevlar nanofibers bridge with metal&#8208;organic framework channels&#160;and in&#8208;situ polymerized deep&#8208;eutectic&#8208;solvent as the ion&#8208;transport carrier is designed on the cathode. This quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte with nano&#8208;network&#8208;topology&#160;has considerable Li+ transport properties, low ionic diffusion activation energy, and high modulus, which guarantees the high cyclic stability of lithium&#8208;metal batteries.








Abstract
An ultra&#8208;thin quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte (QSE) with dendrite&#8208;inhibiting properties is a requirement for achieving high energy density quasi&#8208;solid lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Here, a 5.1&#160;&#181;m rigid QSE layer is directly designed on the cathode, in which Kevlar (poly(p&#8208;phenylene terephthalate)) nanofibers (KANFs) with negatively charged groups bridging metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) particles are served as a rigid skeleton, and non&#8208;flammable deep eutectic solvent is selected to be encapsulated into the MOF channels, combined with in situ polymerization to complete safe electrolyte system with high rigidness and stability. The QSE with&#160;constructed topological network demonstrates high rigidity (5.4&#160;GPa), high ionic conductivity (0.73 mS cm&#8722;1 at room temperature), good ion&#8208;regulated properties, and improved structural stability, contributing to homogenized Li&#8208;ion flux, excellent dendrite suppression, and prolonged cyclic performance for LMB. Additionally, ion regulation influences the Li deposition behavior, exhibiting a uniform morphology on the Li&#8208;metal surface after cycling. According to density&#8208;functional theory, KANFs bridging MOFs as hosts play a vital function in the free&#8208;state and fast diffusion dynamics of Li&#8208;ions. This work provides an effective strategy for constructing ultrathin robust electrolytes with a novel ionic conduction mode.

AlCl3 is employed as a novel additive to induce the F&#8208;containing solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers in potassium&#8208;ion batteries (KIBs). Due to the large charge&#8208;to&#8208;radius ratio of Al3+, the Al&#8208;containing groups in the electrolyte can easily capture F from PF6&#8722; and accelerate the formation of KxF in SEI layer. The &#8220;self&#8208;induced formation&#8221; of F&#8208;rich SEI layers guarantees the excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability of KIBs.








Abstract
Engineering F&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers is regarded as an effective strategy to enable the long&#8208;term cycling stability of potassium&#8208;ion batteries (KIBs). However, in the conventional KPF6 carbonate electrolytes, it is challenging to form F&#8208;containing SEI layers due to the inability of KPF6 to decompose into KxF. Herein, AlCl3 is employed as a novel additive to change the chemical environment of the KPF6 carbonate electrolyte. First, due to the large charge&#8208;to&#8208;radius ratio of Al3+, the Al&#8208;containing groups in the electrolyte can easily capture F from PF6&#8722; and accelerate the formation of KxF in SEI layer. In addition, AlCl3 also reacts with trace H2O or solvents in the electrolytes to form Al2O3, which can further act as a HF scavenger. Upon incorporating AlCl3 into conventional KPF6 carbonate electrolyte, the hard carbon (HC) anode exhibits an ultra&#8208;long lifespan of 10000 cycles with a high coulombic efficiency of &#8776;100%. When coupled with perylene&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA), the full cell exhibits a high capacity retention of 81% after 360 cycles&#8208;significantly outperforming cells using conventional electrolytes. This research paves new avenues for advancing electrolyte engineering towards developing durable batteries tailored for large&#8208;scale energy storage applications.

         <title>Short&#8208;Wave Infrared Colloidal QD Photodetector with Nanosecond Response Times Enabled by Ultrathin Absorber Layers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The record 4 ns response time in colloidal quantum dot photodiodes (QDPDs) that operate at short&#8208;wavelength infrared (SWIR) wavelengths is reported, the first result reaching the requirement of SWIR light detection and ranging based on colloidal QDs. These ultrafast QDPDs combine a thin active layer to reduce the carrier transport time and a small area to inhibit slow capacitive discharging.








Abstract
Ultrafast short&#8208;wavelength infrared (SWIR) photodetection is of great interest for emerging automated vision and spatial mapping technologies. Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) stand out for SWIR photodetection compared to epitaxial (In,Ga)As or (Hg,Cd)Te semiconductors by their combining a size&#8208;tunable bandgap and a suitability for cost&#8208;effective, solution&#8208;based processing. However, achieving ultrafast, nanosecond&#8208;level response time has remained an outstanding challenge for QD&#8208;based SWIR photodiodes (QDPDs). Here, record 4&#160;ns response time in PbS&#8208;based QDPDs that operate at SWIR wavelengths is reported, a result reaching the requirement of SWIR light detection and ranging based on colloidal QDs. These ultrafast QDPDs combine a thin active layer to reduce the carrier transport time and a small area to inhibit slow capacitive discharging. By implementing a concentration gradient ligand exchange method, high&#8208;quality p&#8211;n junctions are fabricated in these ultrathin QDPDs. Moreover, these ultrathin QDPDs attain an external quantum efficiency of 42% at 1330&#160;nm, due to a 2.5&#8208;fold enhanced light absorption through the formation of a Fabry&#8211;Perot cavity within the QDPD and the highly efficient extraction (98%) of photogenerated charge carriers. Based on these results, it is estimated that a further increase of the charge&#8208;carrier mobility can lead to PbS QDPDs with sub&#8208;nanosecond response time.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Level Matching Metal&#8208;Ion Organic Hybrid Interface to Enhance Energy Storage of Polymer&#8208;Based Composite Dielectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To solve the interfacial mismatch between nanosheets and polymers in nanocomposite dielectrics, a &#8220;Metal&#8208;Ion Organic Hybrid Interface&#8221; (MOHI) between nanosheets and polymers is designed. The outstanding energy storage density &#8776;4.75 J cm&#8722;3 with high efficiency of &gt;90% is achieved at 150&#160;&#176;C, which is more than ten times that of polyimide (PI).








Abstract
In this work, a distinctive &#8220;metal&#8208;ion organic hybrid interface&#8221; (MOHI) between polyimide (PI) and calcium niobate (CNO) nanosheets is designed. The metal ions in the MOHI can achieve atomic&#8208;level matching not only with the inorganic CNO, but also with the PI chains, forming uniform and strong chemical bonds. These results are demonstrated by experiment and theory calculations. Significantly, the MOHI reduces the free volume and introduces deep traps across the filler&#8208;matrix interfacial area, thus suppressing the electric field distortion in PI&#8208;based composite dielectrics. Consequently, PI&#8208;based dielectric containing the MOHI exhibits excellent energy storage performance. The energy storage densities (Ue) of the composite dielectric reach 9.42 J cm&#8722;3 and 4.75 J cm&#8722;3 with energy storage efficiency (&#951;) of 90% at 25&#160;&#176;C and 150&#160;&#176;C respectively, which are 2.6 and 11.6 times higher than those of pure PI. This study provides new ideas for polymer&#8208;based composite dielectrics in high energy storage.

         <title>Self&#8208;Encapsulation of High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Nanoparticles inside Carbonized Wood for Highly Durable Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A defect&#8208;driven surface engineering strategy is proposed to prepare a highly active and long&#8208;lasting electrocatalyst composed of quinary high&#8208;entropy alloy nanoparticles (HEAs) (PtNiCoFeCu) encapsulated inside the activated carbonized wood (ACW) through thermal shock. The surface defects of ACW exhibit thermodynamically stable adsorption on the melting HEAs, rendering HEAs to aggregate and nucleate at the defect sites of ACW.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy alloy nanoparticles (HEAs) show great potential in emerging electrocatalysis due to their combination and optimization of multiple elements. However, synthesized HEAs often exhibit a weak interface with the conductive substrate, hindering their applications in long&#8208;term catalysis and energy conversion. Herein, a highly active and durable electrocatalyst composed of quinary HEAs (PtNiCoFeCu) encapsulated inside the activated carbonized wood (ACW) is reported. The self&#8208;encapsulation of HEAs is achieved during Joule heating synthesis (2060 K, 2 s) where HEAs naturally nucleate at the defect sites. In the meantime, HEAs catalyze the deposition of mobile carbon atoms to form a protective few&#8208;layer carbon shell during the rapid quenching process, thus remarkably strengthening the interface stability between HEAs and ACW. As a result, the HEAs@ACW shows not only favorable activity with an overpotential of 7&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for hydrogen evolution but also negligible attenuation during a 500 h stability test, which is superior to most reported electrocatalysts. The design of self&#8208;encapsulated HEAs inside ACW provides a critical strategy to enhance both activity and stability, which is also applicable to many other energy conversion technologies.

         <title>Conjugated Polymer Heteroatom Engineering Enables High Detectivity Symmetric Ambipolar Phototransistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ambipolar organic semiconductors can offer balanced electron and hole transport, enabling light detection when implemented in thin film transistors. Here it is shown how a subtle change in a comonomer heteroatom results in a more electron&#8208;accepting polymer with preferential edge&#8208;on orientation. This results in higher electron mobility OTFTs with balanced charge transport that enable high&#8208;performing NIR ambipolar phototransistors and photo&#8208;inverters.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed high&#8208;performing ambipolar organic phototransistors (OPTs) can enable low&#8208;cost integrated circuits. Here, a heteroatom engineering approach to modify the electron affinity of a low band gap diketopyrrolopyrole (DPP) co&#8208;polymer, resulting in well&#8208;balanced charge transport, a more preferential edge&#8208;on orientation and higher crystallinity, is demonstrated. Changing the comonomer heteroatom from sulfur (benzothiadiazole (BT)) to oxygen (benzooxadiazole (BO)) leads to an increased electron affinity and introduces higher ambipolarity. Organic thin film transistors fabricated from the novel PDPP&#8208;BO exhibit charge carrier mobility of 0.6 and 0.3 cm2&#160;Vs&#8315;1 for electrons and holes, respectively. Due to the high sensitivity of the PDPP&#8208;based material and the balanced transport in PDPP&#8208;BO, its application as an NIR detector in an OPT architecture is presented. By maintaining a high on/off ratio (9 &#215; 104), ambipolar OPTs are shown with photoresponsivity of 69 and 99 A&#160;W&#8315;1 and specific detectivity of 8 &#215; 107 for the p&#8208;type operation and 4 &#215; 109 Jones for the n&#8208;type regime. The high symmetric NIR&#8208;ambipolar OPTs are also evaluated as ambipolar photo&#8208;inverters, and show a 46% gain enhancement under illumination.

         <title>Reprocessability in Engineering Thermosets Achieved Through Frontal Ring&#8208;Opening Metathesis Polymerization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, frontal ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (FROMP) is shown to be an effective technique to manufacture high&#8208;performance poly(dicyclopentadiene) (pDCPD) thermosets with regenerative capabilities. The rapid curing of FROMP preserves the metathesis used to make the material, allowing effective reclamation of pDCPD performance across multiple generations. The strategy is simple and holds real promise to tackle end&#8208;of&#8208;life management challenges in industrial materials.








Abstract
While valued for their durability and exceptional performance, crosslinked thermosets are challenging to recycle and reuse. Here, inherent reprocessability in industrially relevant polyolefin thermosets is unveiled. Unlike prior methods, this approach eliminates the need to introduce exchangeable functionality to regenerate the material, relying instead on preserving the activity of the metathesis catalyst employed in the curing reaction. Frontal ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (FROMP) proves critical to preserving this activity. Conditions controlling catalytic viability are explored to successfully reclaim performance across multiple generations of material, thus demonstrating long&#8208;term reprocessability. This straightforward and scalable remolding strategy is poised for widespread adoption. Given the anticipated growth in polyolefin thermosets, these findings represent an important conceptual advance in the pursuit of a fully circular lifecycle for thermoset polymers.

         <title>Optimizing Ionomer Distribution in Anode Catalyst Layer for Stable Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The anode catalyst layer (ACL) is the key to determining the lifetime of proton exchange membrane water electrolysis. In this work, an efficient gradient ionomer distributed ACL structure is fabricated through optimizing the catalyst ink, which improves the durability by a factor of three compared to the normal ACL when operating at 2.0 A cm&#8722;2 and 80&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
The high cost of proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) originates from the usage of precious materials, insufficient efficiency, and lifetime. In this work, an important degradation mechanism of PEMWE caused by dynamics of ionomers over time in anode catalyst layer (ACL), which is a purely mechanical degradation of microstructure, is identified. Contrary to conventional understanding that the microstructure of ACL is static, the micropores are inclined to be occupied by ionomers due to the localized swelling/creep/migration, especially near the ACL/PTL (porous transport layer) interface, where they form transport channels of reactant/product couples. Consequently, the ACL with increased ionomers at PTL/ACL interface exhibit rapid and continuous degradation. In addition, a close correlation between the microstructure of ACL and the catalyst ink is discovered. Specifically, if more ionomers migrate to the top layer of the ink, more ionomers accumulate at the ACL/PEM interface, leaving fewer ionomers at the ACL/PTL interface. Therefore, the ionomer distribution in ACL is successfully optimized, which exhibits reduced ionomers at the ACL/PTL interface and enriches ionomers at the ACL/PEM interface, reducing the decay rate by a factor of three when operated at 2.0 A cm&#8722;2 and 80&#160;&#176;C. The findings provide a general way to achieve low&#8208;cost hydrogen production.

         <title>High Performance As&#8208;Cast Organic Solar Cells Enabled by a Refined Double&#8208;Fibril Network Morphology and Improved Dielectric Constant of Active Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
As&#8208;cast organic solar cell with a record&#8208;high power conversion efficiency (PCE) is constructed via introducing a novel polymer acceptor (PY&#8208;TPT) into the D18:L8&#8208;BO blend to form a favorable double&#8208;fibril network morphology. Consequently, the as&#8208;cast device affords a champion PCE of 18.60% and excellent device stability, which bring new insights into the construction of efficient as&#8208;cast device.








Abstract
High performance organic solar cells (OSCs) are usually realized by using post&#8208;treatment and/or additive, which can induce the formation of metastable morphology, leading to unfavorable device stability. In terms of the industrial production, the development of high efficiency as&#8208;cast OSCs is crucially important, but it remains a great challenge to obtain appropriate active layer morphology and high power conversion efficiency (PCE). Here, efficient as&#8208;cast OSCs are constructed via introducing a new polymer acceptor PY&#8208;TPT with a high dielectric constant into the D18:L8&#8208;BO blend to form a double&#8208;fibril network morphology. Besides, the incorporation of PY&#8208;TPT enables an enhanced dielectric constant and lower exciton binding energy of active layer. Therefore, efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport are realized in D18:L8&#8208;BO:PY&#8208;TPT&#8208;based device, affording a record&#8208;high PCE of 18.60% and excellent photostability in absence of post&#8208;treatment. Moreover, green solvent&#8208;processed devices, thick&#8208;film (300&#160;nm) devices, and module (16.60 cm2) are fabricated, which show PCEs of 17.45%, 17.54%, and 13.84%, respectively. This work brings new insight into the construction of efficient as&#8208;cast devices, pushing forward the practical application of OSCs.

         <title>The Role of Solution Aggregation Property toward High&#8208;Efficiency Non&#8208;Fullerene Organic Photovoltaic Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematic study of the representative organic photovoltaic systems shows that the aggregation competition between polymer donor (PD) and non&#8208;fullerene acceptor (NFA) is a decisive factor in the phase separation of blend film and thus the photovoltaic performance. Based on 64 PD/NFA combinations, the aggregation ability/photovoltaic parameter heatmaps are plotted, providing a new matching rule for developing high&#8208;efficiency PD/NFA systems.








Abstract
In organic photovoltaic cells, the solution&#8208;aggregation effect (SAE) is long considered a critical factor in achieving high power&#8208;conversion efficiencies for polymer donor (PD)/non&#8208;fullerene acceptor (NFA) blend systems. However, the underlying mechanism has yet to be fully understood. Herein, based on an extensive study of blends consisting of the representative 2D&#8208;benzodithiophene&#8208;based PDs and acceptor&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;type NFAs, it is demonstrated that SAE shows a strong correlation with the aggregation kinetics during solidification, and the aggregation competition between PD and NFA determines the phase separation of blend film and thus the photovoltaic performance.

     alt="The Role of Solution Aggregation Property toward High-Efficiency Non-Fullerene Organic Photovoltaic Cells"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A systematic study of the representative organic photovoltaic systems shows that the aggregation competition between polymer donor (PD) and non-fullerene acceptor (NFA) is a decisive factor in the phase separation of blend film and thus the photovoltaic performance. Based on 64 PD/NFA combinations, the aggregation ability/photovoltaic parameter heatmaps are plotted, providing a new matching rule for developing high-efficiency PD/NFA systems.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In organic photovoltaic cells, the solution-aggregation effect (SAE) is long considered a critical factor in achieving high power-conversion efficiencies for polymer donor (PD)/non-fullerene acceptor (NFA) blend systems. However, the underlying mechanism has yet to be fully understood. Herein, based on an extensive study of blends consisting of the representative 2D-benzodithiophene-based PDs and acceptor&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor-type NFAs, it is demonstrated that SAE shows a strong correlation with the aggregation kinetics during solidification, and the aggregation competition between PD and NFA determines the phase separation of blend film and thus the photovoltaic performance. PDs with strong SAEs enable earlier aggregation evolutions than NFAs, resulting in well-known polymer-templated fibrillar network structures and superior PCEs. With the weakening of PDs&#8217; aggregation effects, NFAs, showing stronger tendencies to aggregate, tend to form oversized domains, leading to significantly reduced external quantum efficiencies and fill factors. These trends reveal the importance of matching SAE between PD and NFA. The aggregation abilities of various materials are further evaluated and the aggregation ability/photovoltaic parameter diagrams of 64 PD/NFA combinations are provided. This work proposes a guiding criteria and facile approach to match efficient PD/NFA systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrically Conductive Collagen&#8208;PEDOT:PSS Hydrogel Prevents Post&#8208;Infarct Cardiac Arrhythmia and Supports hiPSC&#8208;Cardiomyocyte Function</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrically conductive hydrogel is developed to prevent arrhythmia after myocardial infarction (MI), allowing human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)&#8208;cardiomyocyte function and maturation. Incorporation of poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) in collagen results in a hydrogel with different microstructure, enhanced gelation kinetics, and increased conductivity. hiPSC&#8208;cardiomyocytes exhibit in this hydrogel mature sarcomeric structures and enhanced calcium handling. Transplanting collagen&#8208;PEDOT:PSS hydrogels is sufficient to protect the infarcted heart against ventricular tachycardia.








Abstract
Myocardial infarction (MI) causes cell death, disrupts electrical activity, triggers arrhythmia, and results in heart failure, whereby 50&#8211;60% of MI&#8208;associated deaths manifest as sudden cardiac deaths (SCD). The most effective therapy for SCD prevention is implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs). However, ICDs contribute to adverse remodeling and disease progression and do not prevent arrhythmia. This work develops an injectable collagen&#8208;PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate) hydrogel that protects infarcted hearts against ventricular tachycardia (VT) and can be combined with human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)&#8208;cardiomyocytes to promote partial cardiac remuscularization. PEDOT:PSS improves collagen gel formation, micromorphology, and conductivity. hiPSC&#8208;cardiomyocytes in collagen&#8208;PEDOT:PSS hydrogels exhibit near&#8208;adult sarcomeric length, improved contractility, enhanced calcium handling, and conduction velocity. RNA&#8208;sequencing data indicate enhanced maturation and improved cell&#8208;matrix interactions. Injecting collagen&#8208;PEDOT:PSS hydrogels in infarcted mouse hearts decreases VT to the levels of healthy hearts. Collectively, collagen&#8208;PEDOT:PSS hydrogels offer a versatile platform for treating cardiac injuries.

         <title>Smart Nanoassembly Enabling Activatable NIR Fluorescence and ROS Generation with Enhanced Tumor Penetration for Imaging&#8208;Guided Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
LipoHPM, a smart tumor&#8208;targeting nanoplatform, integrates activatable fluorescence imaging and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation within tumor cells. Both fluorescence and ROS exhibit an OFF&#8208;state in blood circulation, minimizing background interference and phototoxic side effects. Upon tumor internalization, LipoHPM switches to an ON&#8208;state, releasing hydralazine for enhanced tumor penetration, activating fluorescence for high&#8208;contrast tumor imaging, and boosting ROS generation for potent photodynamic therapy efficacy.








Abstract
Fluorescence imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy (FIG&#8208;PDT) holds promise for cancer treatment, yet challenges persist in poor imaging quality, phototoxicity, and insufficient anti&#8208;tumor effect. Herein, a novel nanoplatform, LipoHPM, designed to address these challenges, is reported. This approach employs an acid&#8208;sensitive amine linker to connect a biotin&#8208;modified hydrophilic polymer (BiotinPEG) with a new hydrophobic photosensitizer (MBA), forming OFF&#8208;state BiotinPEG&#8208;MBA (PM) micelles via an aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) effect. These micelles are then co&#8208;loaded with the tumor penetration enhancer hydralazine (HDZ) into pH&#8208;sensitive liposomes (LipoHPM). Leveraging the ACQ effect, LipoHPM is silent in both fluorescence and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation during blood circulation but restores both properties upon disassembly. Following intravenous injection in tumor&#8208;bearing mice, LipoHPM actively targets tumor cells overexpressing biotin&#8208;receptors, contributing to enhanced tumor accumulation. Upon cellular internalization, LipoHPM disassembles within lysosomes, releasing HDZ to enhance tumor penetration and inhibit tumor metastasis. Concurrently, the micelles activate fluorescence for tumor imaging and boost the production of both type&#8208;I and type&#8208;II ROS for tumor eradication. Therefore, the smart LipoHPM synergistically integrates near&#8208;infrared emission, activatable tumor imaging, robust ROS generation, efficient anti&#8208;tumor and anti&#8208;metastasis activity, successfully overcoming limitations of conventional photosensitizers and establishing itself as a promising nanoplatform for potent FIG&#8208;PDT applications.

Tissue Engineering
In article number 2308949 by Maik Schot, Jeroen Leijten, and co&#8208;workers, engineered living tissues containing high density capillary networks are fabricated in a clinically scalable manner. This is achieved by photo&#8208;annealing living microtissues, which are mass produced using in&#8208;air microfluidics. The resulting microporous yet monolithic living tissues are directly perfusable and offer micrometer&#8208;scale diffusive length regardless of tissue size, enabling unprecedented exchange rates for nutrients, waste products, and stimulating molecules to allow for the upscaling of living matter.

Revealing Element Distributions on High Entropy Alloy Surface
By combining elemental sensitive synchrotron X&#8208;ray techniques with high spatial resolution scanning tunneling microscopy, the authors are able to extract the element distributions at the sub&#8208;nm scale on the surfaces of high entropy alloys. In article number 2402442, Lauren Kim, TeYu Chien, and co&#8208;workers utilize X&#8208;ray assisted tunneling to enhance the elemental sensitivity with high spatial resolution to achieve this goal. This technique paves the path for correlating element local arrangements to the physical properties of the high entropy materials.

Blocking Sound with Silk
In article number 2313328 by Yoel Fink and co&#8208;workers, sound control using traditional fabrics is explored. A silk fabric with a piezoelectric fiber emits 70 dB of sound. Surprisingly, by dynamically suppressing vibrations in a 130&#8208;micron silk monolayer, transmitted sound decreases by 75% and acoustic reflectivity increases by 68%. These findings present opportunities in apparel, transportation, and architecture.

Highly Durable Electrocatalysis
In article number 2402391, Yonggang Yao, Wentao Gan, and co&#8208;workers report a highly active and long&#8208;lasting electrocatalyst composed of quinary HEAs (PtNiCoFeCu) encapsulated inside the activated carbonized wood (ACW) through Joule heating and rapid quenching treatment. The surface defects of ACW exhibit thermodynamically stable adsorption on the melting HEAs, which induces HEAs to aggregate and nucleate at the defect sites of ACW. This self&#8208;encapsulation design provides a critical strategy to enhance both electrocatalytic activity and stability, which is also applicable to many other energy conversion technologies.

Post&#8208;Transition Metal Chalcogenides
In article number 2400800, Sungkyu Kim, Feng Ding, Joonki Suh, and co&#8208;workers introduce so&#8208;called phase&#8208;centric approach for producing post&#8208;transition metal chalcogenides using low&#8208;temperature metal&#8211;organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). High&#8208;crystalline 2D SnSe2 films can be directly prepared in wafer scale with excellent uniformity. With theoretical inputs, the authors indirectly produce SnSe film with all benefits of MOCVD. This set of techniques will provide a new route to the BEOL&#8208;compatible preparation of high&#8208;quality post&#8208;transition metal chalcogenides.

         <title>Evolution of Musculoskeletal Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The action motion and biosignals of the musculoskeletal system from in vitro to in vivo play critical role in both medical diagnosis and personal healthcare. In this review, the musculoskeletal electronics is proposed, and the history is briefly outlined, strategies and development trend of related materials and devices are progressed and designed.








Abstract
The musculoskeletal system, constituting the largest human physiological system, plays a critical role in providing structural support to the body, facilitating intricate movements, and safeguarding internal organs. By virtue of advancements in revolutionized materials and devices, particularly in the realms of motion capture, health monitoring, and postoperative rehabilitation, &#8220;musculoskeletal electronics&#8221; has actually emerged as an infancy area, but has not yet been explicitly proposed. In this review, the concept of musculoskeletal electronics is elucidated, and the evolution history, representative progress, and key strategies of the involved materials and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art devices are summarized. Therefore, the fundamentals of musculoskeletal electronics and key functionality categories are introduced. Subsequently, recent advances in musculoskeletal electronics are presented from the perspectives of &#8220;in vitro&#8221; to &#8220;in vivo&#8221; signal detection, interactive modulation, and therapeutic interventions for healing and recovery. Additionally, nine strategy avenues for the development of advanced musculoskeletal electronic materials and devices are proposed. Finally, concise summaries and perspectives are proposed to highlight the directions that deserve focused attention in this booming field.

         <title>The Critical Analysis of Membranes toward Sustainable and Efficient Vanadium Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFB) are considered to be promising for large&#8208;scale storage of electrical energy with safety, flexibility, and durability. This review analyzes how key parameters of membranes that are critical components in VRFBs influence the device performance. Insights into design strategies for membranes for efficient VRFB are provided.








Abstract
Vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFB) are a promising technology for large&#8208;scale storage of electrical energy, combining safety, high capacity, ease of scalability, and prolonged durability; features which have triggered their early commercial implementation. Furthering the deployment of VRFB technologies requires addressing challenges associated to a pivotal component: the membrane. Examples include vanadium crossover, insufficient conductivity, escalated costs, and sustainability concerns related to the widespread adoption of perfluoroalkyl&#8208;based membranes, e.g., perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA). Herein, recent advances in high&#8208;performance and sustainable membranes for VRFB, offering insights into prospective research directions to overcome these challenges, are reviewed. The analysis reveals the disparities and trade&#8208;offs between performance advances enabled by PFSA membranes and composites, and the lack of sustainability in their final applications. The potential of PFSA&#8208;free membranes and present strategies to enhance their performance are discussed. This study delves into vital membrane parameters to enhance battery performance, suggesting protocols and design strategies to achieve high&#8208;performance and sustainable VRFB membranes.

         <title>Immunoengineering Biomaterials for Musculoskeletal Tissue Repair across Lifespan</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review addresses the intersection of the immune system and aging in biomaterial&#8208;mediated musculoskeletal tissue repair. The authors provide an overview of how aging impacts tissue physiology, immunity, and biomaterial responses. Then, the authors discuss the roles of the immune system in biomaterial&#8208;mediated repair of cartilage, muscle, and bone; and the impact of aging on biomaterial responses in these tissues.








Abstract
Musculoskeletal diseases and injuries are among the leading causes of pain and morbidity worldwide. Broad efforts have focused on developing pro&#8208;regenerative biomaterials to treat musculoskeletal conditions; however, these approaches have yet to make a significant clinical impact. Recent studies have demonstrated that the immune system is central in orchestrating tissue repair and that targeting pro&#8208;regenerative immune responses can improve biomaterial therapeutic outcomes. However, aging is a critical factor negatively affecting musculoskeletal tissue repair and immune function. Hence, understanding how age affects the response to biomaterials is essential for improving musculoskeletal biomaterial therapies. This review focuses on the intersection of the immune system and aging in response to biomaterials for musculoskeletal tissue repair. The article introduces the general impacts of aging on tissue physiology, the immune system, and the response to biomaterials. Then, it explains how the adaptive immune system guides the response to injury and biomaterial implants in cartilage, muscle, and bone and discusses how aging impacts these processes in each tissue type. The review concludes by highlighting future directions for the development and translation of personalized immunomodulatory biomaterials for musculoskeletal tissue repair.

Ultrasmall mesoporous nanoparticles (&lt;50&#160;nm), a unique porous nanomaterial, have been widely studied in many fields in the last decade owing to the abundant advantages, involving rich mesopores, low density, high surface area, numerous reaction sites, large cavity space, ultrasmall size, etc. This paper presents a review of recent advances in the preparation, functionalization, and applications of ultrasmall inorganic mesoporous nanoparticles for the first time. The soft monomicelles&#8208;directed method, in contrast to the hard&#8208;template and template&#8208;free methods, is more flexible in the synthesis of mesoporous nanoparticles. This is because the amphiphilic micelle has tunable functional blocks, controlled molecule masses, configurations and mesostructures. Focus on the soft micelle directing method, monomicelles could be classified into four types, i.e., the Pluronic&#8208;type block copolymer monomicelles, laboratory&#8208;synthesized amphiphilic block copolymers monomicelles, the single&#8208;molecule star&#8208;shaped block copolymer monomicelles, and the small&#8208;molecule anionic/cationic surfactant monomicelles. This paper also reviews the functionalization of the inner mesopores and the outer surfaces, which includes constructing the yolkshell structures (encapsulated nanoparticles), anchoring the active components packed on the shell and building an asymmetric Janus architecture. Then, several representative applications, involving catalysis, energy storage, and biomedicines are presented. Finally, the prospects and challenges of controlled synthesis and large&#8208;scale applications of ultrasmall mesoporous nanoparticles in the future are foreseen.

This study summarizes the recent discovery on how to convert, in one pot, non&#8208;toxic earth&#8208;abundant precursors into nanostructures at the kilogram scale at temperatures &lt;100&#160;&#176;C and under ambient pressures. MnO2, 2D birnessite flakes, Fe3O4 nanoparticles, and titanate 1D nanofilaments are synthesized; the latter is a new form of TiO2 that exhibits quantum confinement and has a host of applications.








Abstract
Metal oxide nanostructures have received an increasing attention owing to their unique chemical and physical properties along with their widespread applications in various fields. This article provides an overview of the recent discovery &#8211; christened Hydroxides&#8208;Derived Nanostructures, or HDNs &#8211; in which hydroxide aqueous solutions (mostly tetramethylammonium hydroxide, TMAH) are reacted at temperatures &lt; 100&#160;&#176;C and under atmospheric pressure with various metal&#8208;containing precursors to scalably prepare novel metal oxide nanostructures. In one case, a dozen commercial and earth abundant Ti&#8208;containing powders such as binary carbides, nitrides, borides, among others, are converted into new, 1D TiO2&#8208;based lepidocrocite (1DL) nanofilaments (NFs). Application&#8208;wise, the 1DLs show outstanding performance in a number of energy, environmental, and biomedical fields such as photo&#8208; and electrocatalysis, water splitting, lithium&#8211;sulfur and lithium&#8208;ion batteries, water purification, dye degradation, cancer therapy, and polymer composites. In addition to 1DL, the HDNs family encompasses other metal oxides nanostructures including magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles and MnO2 birnessite&#8208;based crystalline 2D flakes. The latter showed promise in electrochemical energy conversion and storage applications. The developed recipe provides a new vista in the molecular self&#8208;assembly synthesis of nanomaterials that can advance the field with a library of novel nanostructures with substantial implications in a multitude of fields.

         <title>Challenges and Breakthroughs in Enhancing Temperature Tolerance of Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) demonstrate distinct advantages over lithium&#8208;ion batteries across various applications when considering a wide temperature range. Herein, this review delves into the research on wide&#8208;temperature SIBs, offering a comprehensive analysis of how temperature affects the parameters governing battery performance. Furthermore, it summarizes the modification strategies for electrodes and electrolytes aimed at enhancing battery performance under extreme temperature conditions.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;based batteries (LBBs) have been highly researched and recognized as a mature electrochemical energy storage (EES) system in recent years. However, their stability and effectiveness are primarily confined to room temperature conditions. At temperatures significantly below 0&#160;&#176;C or above 60&#160;&#176;C, LBBs experience substantial performance degradation. Under such challenging extreme contexts, sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) emerge as a promising complementary technology, distinguished by their fast dynamics at low&#8208;temperature regions and superior safety under elevated temperatures. Notably, developing SIBs suitable for wide&#8208;temperature usage still presents significant challenges, particularly for specific applications such as electric vehicles, renewable energy storage, and deep&#8208;space/polar explorations, which requires a thorough understanding of how SIBs perform under different temperature conditions. By reviewing the development of wide&#8208;temperature SIBs, the influence of temperature on the parameters related to battery performance, such as reaction constant, charge transfer resistance, etc., is systematically and comprehensively analyzed. The review emphasizes challenges encountered by SIBs in both low and high temperatures while exploring recent advancements in SIB materials, specifically focusing on strategies to enhance battery performance across diverse temperature ranges. Overall, insights gained from these studies will drive the development of SIBs that can handle the challenges posed by diverse and harsh climates.

         <dc:description>
The article explores catalyst size evolution in Fenton&#8208;like reactions from nano to atomic scale. The review comprehensively discusses advanced characterization techniques and theoretical calculations for evaluating catalyst properties and reaction mechanisms. The size effect is closely associated with catalytic activities and behaviors by modulating metal&#8211;support interactions, electronic structures, and geometric configurations. Finally, the review summarizes recent advances in catalytic membranes and engineering applications of Fenton&#8208;like&#8208;based systems and proposes future perspectives in intelligent catalyst design.








Abstract
State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Fenton&#8208;like reactions are crucial in advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) for water purification. This review explores the latest advancements in heterogeneous metal&#8208;based catalysts within AOPs, covering nanoparticles (NPs), single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), and ultra&#8208;small atom clusters. A distinct connection between the physical properties of these catalysts, such as size, degree of unsaturation, electronic structure, and oxidation state, and their impacts on catalytic behavior and efficacy in Fenton&#8208;like reactions. In&#8208;depth comparative analysis of metal NPs and SACs is conducted focusing on how particle size variations and metal&#8208;support interactions affect oxidation species and pathways. The review highlights the cutting&#8208;edge characterization techniques and theoretical calculations, indispensable for deciphering the complex electronic and structural characteristics of active sites in downsized metal particles. Additionally, the review underscores innovative strategies for immobilizing these catalysts onto membrane surfaces, offering a solution to the inherent challenges of powdered catalysts. Recent advances in pilot&#8208;scale or engineering applications of Fenton&#8208;like&#8208;based devices are also summarized for the first time. The paper concludes by charting new research directions, emphasizing advanced catalyst design, precise identification of reactive oxygen species, and in&#8208;depth mechanistic studies. These efforts aim to enhance the application potential of nanotechnology&#8208;based AOPs in real&#8208;world wastewater treatment.

         <title>Fusing Science with Industry: Perovskite Photovoltaics Moving Rapidly into Industrialization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The organic&#8208;inorganic lead halide perovskite materials have emerged as highly promising contenders in the field of photovoltaic technology, offering exceptional efficiency and cost&#8208;effectiveness. The commercialization of perovskite photovoltaics hinges on successfully transitioning from lab&#8208;scale perovskite solar cells to large&#8208;scale perovskite solar modules (PSMs). However, the efficiency of PSMs significantly diminishes with increasing device area, impeding commercial viability. Central to achieving high&#8208;efficiency PSMs is fabricating uniform functional films and optimizing interfaces to minimize energy loss. In this review, we shed light on the path towards large&#8208;scale PSMs, emphasizing the pivotal role of integrating cutting&#8208;edge scientific research with industrial technology. By exploring scalable deposition techniques and optimization strategies, we reveal the advancements and challenges in fabricating large&#8208;area perovskite films. Subsequently, we delve into the architecture and contact materials of PSMs while addressing pertinent interface issues. Crucially, we analyze efficiency loss during scale&#8208;up and stability risks encountered by PSMs. Furthermore, we highlight the advancements in industrial efforts towards perovskite commercialization, emphasizing the perspective of PSMs in revolutionizing renewable energy. By highlighting the scientific and technical challenges in developing PSMs, we stress the importance of combining science and industry to drive their industrialization and pave the way for future advancements.

         <title>Topological Quantum Switching Enabled Neuroelectronic Synaptic Modulators for Brain Computer Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work illustrating a developed synaptic neuroelectronic device using Bi2Se2Te quantum topological insulator marks a significant advancement in neuromorphic technology for rehabilitating neurological disorders through brain&#8211;computer interfaced neuroprosthetics. It demonstrates controlled brain synchronization and enhanced memory functions, offering a novel approach to mitigating the effects of aging and neurological disorders.








Abstract
Aging and genetic&#8208;related disorders in the human brain lead to impairment of daily cognitive functions. Due to their neural synaptic complexity and the current limits of knowledge, reversing these disorders remains a substantial challenge for brain&#8211;computer interfaces (BCI). In this work, a solution is provided to potentially override aging and neurological disorder&#8208;related cognitive function loss in the human brain through the application of the authors&#8217; quantum synaptic device. To illustrate this point, a quantum topological insulator (QTI) Bi2Se2Te&#8208;based synaptic neuroelectronic device, where the electric field&#8208;induced tunable topological surface edge states and quantum switching properties make them a premier option for establishing artificial synaptic neuromodulation approaches, is designed and developed. Leveraging these unique quantum synaptic properties, the developed synaptic device provides the capability to neuromodulate distorted neural signals, leading to the reversal of age&#8208;related disorders via BCI. With the synaptic neuroelectronic characteristics of this device, excellent efficacy in treating cognitive neural dysfunctions through modulated neuromorphic stimuli is demonstrated. As a proof of concept, real&#8208;time neuromodulation of electroencephalogram (EEG) deduced distorted event&#8208;related potentials (ERP) is demonstrated by modulation of the synaptic device array.

         <title>Photostrictive Actuators Based on Freestanding Ferroelectric Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The work demonstrates the application of photostriction to wirelessly drive freestanding ferroelectric membranes as resonators/actuators. Photoexcited electrons screen the ferroelectric polarization generating an in&#8208;plane strain: the underlying mechanism behind photostriction. Consequently, ferroelectric membranes exhibit orders of magnitude larger responses than non&#8208;ferroelectric ones. The findings provide significant insight for future applications in optical micro&#8208;electromechanical systems and&#160;sensors using ferroelectrics.








Abstract
Complex oxides offer a wide range of functional properties, and recent advances in the fabrication of freestanding membranes of these oxides are adding new mechanical degrees of freedom to this already rich functional ecosystem. Here, photoactuation is demonstrated in freestanding thin film resonators of ferroelectric Barium Titanate (BaTiO3) and paraelectric Strontium Titanate (SrTiO3). The free&#8208;standing films, transferred onto perforated supports, act as nano&#8208;drums, oscillating at their natural resonance frequency when illuminated by a frequency&#8208;modulated laser. The light&#8208;induced deflections in the ferroelectric BaTiO3 membranes are two orders of magnitude larger than in the paraelectric SrTiO3 ones. Time&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray micro&#8208;diffraction under illumination and temperature&#8208;dependent holographic interferometry provide combined evidence for the photostrictive strain in BaTiO3 originating from a partial screening of ferroelectric polarization by photo&#8208;excited carriers, which decreases the tetragonality of the unit cell. These findings showcase the potential of photostrictive freestanding ferroelectric films as wireless actuators operated by&#160;light.

         <title>Simple Sol&#8208;Gel Protein Stabilization toward Rainbow and White Lighting Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a new synthetic method for the production of silica&#8208;encapsulated protein nanomaterials without the use of organic solvents or surfactants is reported. The new pathway simplifies the procedure, allowing for less stable proteins to be used. Single&#8208;layer coatings based on several fluorescent proteins for white/rainbow lighting applications are fabricated, with improved efficiencies and stabilities.








Abstract
Fluorescent proteins (FPs) are heralded as a paradigm of sustainable materials for photonics/optoelectronics. However, their stabilization under non&#8208;physiological environments and/or harsh operation conditions is the major challenge. Among the FP&#8208;stabilization methods, classical sol&#8208;gel is the most effective, but less versatile, as most of the proteins/enzymes are easily degraded due to the need of multi&#8208;step processes, surfactants, and mixed water/organic solvents in extreme pH. Herein, sol&#8208;gel chemistry with archetypal FPs (mGreenLantern; mCherry) is revisited, simplifying the method by one&#8208;pot, surfactant&#8208;free, and aqueous media (phosphate buffer saline pH&#160;=&#160;7.4). The synthesis mechanism involves the direct reaction of the carboxylic groups at the FP surface with the silica precursor, generating a positively charged FP intermediate that acts as a seed for the formation of size&#8208;controlled mesoporous FP@SiO2 nanoparticles. Green&#8208;/red&#8208;emissive (single&#8208;FP component) and dual&#8208;emissive (multi&#8208;FPs component; kinetic studies not required) FP@SiO2 are prepared without affecting the FP photoluminescence and stabilities (&gt;6&#160;months) under dry storage and organic solvent suspensions. Finally, FP@SiO2 color filters are applied to rainbow and white bio&#8208;hybrid light&#8208;emitting diodes featuring up to 15&#8208;fold enhanced stabilities without reducing luminous efficacy compared to references with native FPs. Overall, an easy, versatile, and effective FP&#8208;stabilization method is demonstrated in FP@SiO2 toward sustainable protein lighting.

         <title>Glycocalyx&#8208;Mimicking Nanoparticles with Differential Organ Selectivity for Drug Delivery and Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of glycocalyx&#8208;mimicking nanoparticles (GlyNPs) is constructed as a platform enabling identification of organ&#8208;targeting drug delivery by systematic in vivo screening. The identified GlyNP hits show preferential accumulation in the target organ as well as cellular tropism within the target organ. When liver&#8208;, kidney&#8208;, and spleen&#8208;targeting GlyNP hits are equipped with therapeutics, the formulations effectively alleviate symptoms in organ&#8208;associated disease models.








Abstract
Organ&#8208;selective drug delivery is expected to maximize the efficacy of various therapeutic modalities while minimizing their systemic toxicity. Lipid nanoparticles and polymersomes can direct the organ&#8208;selective delivery of mRNAs or gene editing machineries, but their delivery is limited to mostly liver, spleen, and lung. A platform that enables delivery to these and other target organs is urgently needed. Here, a library of glycocalyx&#8208;mimicking nanoparticles (GlyNPs) comprising five randomly combined sugar moieties is generated, and direct in vivo library screening is used to identify GlyNPs with preferential biodistribution in liver, spleen, lung, kidneys, heart, and brain. Each organ&#8208;targeting GlyNP hit show cellular tropism within the organ. Liver, kidney, and spleen&#8208;targeting GlyNP hits equipped with therapeutics effectively can alleviate the symptoms of acetaminophen&#8208;induced liver injury, cisplatin&#8208;induced kidney injury, and immune thrombocytopenia in mice, respectively. Furthermore, the differential organ targeting of GlyNP hits is influenced not by the protein corona but by the sugar moieties displayed on their surface. It is envisioned that the GlyNP&#8208;based platform may enable the organ&#8208; and cell&#8208;targeted delivery of therapeutic cargoes.

         <title>In&#8208;Synthesis Se&#8208;Stabilization Enables Defect and Doping Engineering of HgTe Colloidal Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in&#8208;synthesis Se&#8208;stabilization strategy is developed for HgTe colloidal quantum dots (CQDs), enabling enhanced colloidal stability, doping tuning and improved passivation. This translated into greatly improved device performance and stability.








Abstract
Colloidal Quantum Dots (CQDs) of mercury telluride (HgTe) hold particular appeal for infrared photodetection due to their widely tunable infrared absorption and good compatibility with silicon electronics.

         <title>Room Temperature Polariton Condensation from Whispering Gallery Modes in CsPbBr3 Microplatelets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The room temperature polariton condensate presents unprecedented prospects for the development of novel photonics devices. Using perovskite materials offers distinct advantages including ease of synthesis, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and compatibility with existing semiconductor technologies. Synthesizing CsPbBr3 microplatelets using low&#8208;cost capillary bridge methods enables not only the formation of whispering gallery modes, but also the onset of polariton condensation at low thresholds.








Abstract
Room temperature (RT) polariton condensate holds exceptional promise for revolutionizing various fields of science and technology, encompassing optoelectronics devices to quantum information processing. Using perovskite materials, like all&#8208;inorganic cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr3) single crystal, provides additional advantages, such as ease of synthesis, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and compatibility with existing semiconductor technologies. In this work, the formation of whispering gallery modes (WGM) in CsPbBr3 single crystals with controlled geometry is shown, synthesized using a low&#8208;cost and efficient capillary bridge method. Through the implementation of microplatelets geometry, enhanced optical properties and performance are achieved due to the presence of sharp edges and a uniform surface, effectively avoiding non&#8208;radiative scattering losses caused by defects. This allows not only to observe strong light matter coupling and formation of whispering gallery polaritons, but also to demonstrate the onset of polariton condensation at RT. This investigation not only contributes to the advancement of the knowledge concerning the exceptional optical properties of perovskite&#8208;based polariton systems, but also unveils prospects for the exploration of WGM polariton condensation within the framework of a 3D perovskite&#8208;based platform, working at RT. The unique characteristics of polariton condensate, including low excitation thresholds and ultrafast dynamics, open up unique opportunities for advancements in photonics and optoelectronics&#160;devices.

         <title>Robust Chemiresistive Behavior in Conductive Polymer/MOF Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Described in this study is a hybridization strategy combining conductive metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) and polymers for improved gas sensing. Significant enhancements in sensor recovery kinetics, cycling stability, and dynamic range at room temperature are demonstrated. Mechanistic insights into energy band alignments and sorbate&#8211;analyte interactions reported here are promising toward future high&#8208;performance chemiresistors as well as novel electronic devices based on polymer/MOF composites.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising materials for gas sensing but are often limited to single&#8208;use detection. A hybridization strategy is demonstrated synergistically deploying conductive MOFs (cMOFs) and conductive polymers (cPs) as two complementary mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors in high&#8208;performing stand&#8208;alone chemiresistors. This work presents significant improvement in i) sensor recovery kinetics, ii) cycling stability, and iii) dynamic range at room temperature. The effect of hybridization across well&#8208;studied cMOFs is demonstrated based on 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydroxytriphenylene (HHTP) and 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexaiminotriphenylene (HITP) ligands with varied metal nodes (Co, Cu, Ni). A comprehensive mechanistic study is conducted to relate energy band alignments at the heterojunctions between the MOFs and the polymer with sensing thermodynamics and binding kinetics. The findings reveal that hole enrichment of the cMOF component upon hybridization leads to selective enhancement in desorption kinetics, enabling significantly improved sensor recovery at room temperature, and thus long&#8208;term response retention. This mechanism is further supported by density functional theory calculations on sorbate&#8211;analyte interactions. It is also found that alloying cPs and cMOFs enables facile thin film co&#8208;processing and device integration, potentially unlocking the use of these hybrid conductors in diverse electronic applications.

         <title>Dismantlable Coronated Nanoparticles for Coupling the Induction and Perception of Immunogenic Cell Death</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dismantlable coronated nanoparticles are fabricated as spatiotemporally controlled nanocarriers for coupling immunogenic cell death (ICD) induction to immune perception. The covalently cross&#8208;linked antibody corona shell disassembles in the tumor microenvironment, enables dual ICD modulations within tumor cells and on dendritic cell surfaces, promotes cytotoxic T cell recruitment, and sensitizes tumors to immune checkpoint blockade in breast and colorectal cancers.








Abstract
Therapy&#8208;induced immunogenic cell death (ICD) can initiate both innate and adaptive immune responses for amplified anti&#8208;tumor efficacy. However, dying cell&#8208;released ICD signals are prone to being sequestered by the TIM&#8208;3 receptors on dendritic cell (DC) surfaces, preventing immune surveillance. Herein, dismantlable coronated nanoparticles (NPs) are fabricated as a type of spatiotemporally controlled nanocarriers for coupling tumor cell&#8208;mediated ICD induction to DC&#8208;mediated immune sensing. These NPs are loaded with an ICD inducer, mitoxantrone (MTO), and wrapped by a redox&#8208;labile anti&#8208;TIM&#8208;3 (&#945;TIM&#8208;3) antibody corona, forming a separable core&#8211;shell structure. The antibody corona disintegrates under high levels of extracellular reactive oxygen species in the tumor microenvironment, exposing the MTO&#8208;loaded NP core for ICD induction and releasing functional &#945;TIM&#8208;3 molecules for DC sensitization. Systemic administration of the coronated NPs augments DC maturation, promotes cytotoxic T cell recruitment, enhances tumor susceptibility to immune checkpoint blockade, and prevents the side effects of MTO. This study develops a promising nanoplatform to unleash the potential of host immunity in cancer therapy.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Pressure&#8208;Dependent Programmable Mechanical Metamaterial with Self&#8208;Sealing Ability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;sealing is a fascinating function in living systems, essential for immediate response to damage. The self&#8208;sealing principle found in the plant model of Delosperma cooperi has inspired the design of mechanical metamaterial that can react autonomously to induced damage. By harnessing the internal pressure, the presented metamaterial is capable of closing cracks, facilitating favorable conditions for a potential subsequent self&#8208;healing process.








Abstract
Self&#8208;sealing is one of the fascinating functions in nature that enables living material systems to respond immediately to damage. A prime plant model is Delosperma cooperi, which can rapidly self&#8208;seal damaged succulent leaves by systematically deforming until the wound closes. Inspired by this self&#8208;sealing principle, a novel programmable mechanical metamaterial has been developed to mimic the underlying damage management concept. This material is able to react autonomously to changes in its physical condition caused by an induced damage. To design this ability into the programmable metamaterial, a permeable unit cell design has been developed that can change size depending on the internal pressure. The parameter space and associated mechanical functionality of the unit cell design is simulated and analyzed under periodic boundary conditions and various pressures. The principles of self&#8208;sealing behavior in designed metamaterials are investigated, crack closure efficiency is identified for different crack lengths, the limitations of the proposed approach are discussed, and successful crack closure is experimentally demonstrated in the fabricated metamaterial. Although this study facilitates the first step on the way of integrating new bio&#8208;inspired principles in the metamaterials, the results show how programmable mechanical metamaterials might extend materials design space from pure properties to life&#8208;like&#160;abilities.

To design this ability into the programmable metamaterial, a permeable unit cell design has been developed that can change size depending on the internal pressure. The parameter space and associated mechanical functionality of the unit cell design is simulated and analyzed under periodic boundary conditions and various pressures. The principles of self-sealing behavior in designed metamaterials are investigated, crack closure efficiency is identified for different crack lengths, the limitations of the proposed approach are discussed, and successful crack closure is experimentally demonstrated in the fabricated metamaterial. Although this study facilitates the first step on the way of integrating new bio-inspired principles in the metamaterials, the results show how programmable mechanical metamaterials might extend materials design space from pure properties to life-like&#160;abilities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Ligand&#8208;Directed Spatial Regulation to Structural and Functional Tunability in Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Luminogen&#8208;Functionalized Organic&#8211;Inorganic Nanoassemblies</title>

Here, a facile and general emulsion self&#8208;assembly tactic is proposed for synthesizing well&#8208;defined AIEgen&#8208;functionalized organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid nanoparticles (OINPs) by coassembling alkane chain&#8208;functionalized inorganic nanoparticles with hydrophobic organic AIEgens. By varying the alkane ligand length and density on the surface of inorganic nanoparticles, the ligand&#8208;directed spatial regulation tailored structures, properties, and functionalities, thus championing the progressive development of AIEgen&#8208;functionalized OINPs are successfully achieved.








Abstract
Aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogen (AIEgen)&#8208;functionalized organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid nanoparticles (OINPs) are an emerging category of multifunctional nanomaterials with vast potential applications. The spatial arrangement and positioning of AIEgens and inorganic compounds in AIEgen&#8208;functionalized OINPs determine the structures, properties, and functionalities of the self&#8208;assembled nanomaterials. In this work, a facile and general emulsion self&#8208;assembly tactic for synthesizing well&#8208;defined AIEgen&#8208;functionalized OINPs is proposed by coassembling alkane chain&#8208;functionalized inorganic nanoparticles with hydrophobic organic AIEgens. As a proof of concept, the self&#8208;assembly and structural evolution of plasmonic&#8208;fluorescent hybrid nanoparticles (PFNPs) from concentric circle to core shell and then to Janus structures is demonstrated by using alkane chain&#8208;modified AuNPs and AIEgens as building blocks. The spatial position of AuNPs in the signal nanocomposite is controlled by varying the alkane ligand length and density on the AuNP surface. The mechanism behind the formation of various PFNP nanostructures is also elucidated through experiments and theoretical simulation. The obtained PFNPs with diverse structures exhibit spatially tunable optical and photothermal properties for advanced applications in multicolor and multimode immunolabeling and photothermal sterilization. This work presents an innovative synthetic approach of constructing AIEgen&#8208;functionalized OINPs with diverse structures, compositions, and functionalities, thereby championing the progressive development of these OINPs.

         <title>Structurally Aligned Multifunctional Neural Probe (SAMP) Using Forest&#8208;Drawn CNT Sheet onto Thermally Drawn Polymer Fiber for Long&#8208;Term In Vivo Operation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Structurally Aligned Multifunctional neural Probe (SAMP), which integrates forest&#8208;drawn CNT sheets integrated onto thermally drawn polymer fibers, is presented with an emphasis on its manufacturing novelty and in vivo capabilities: 1) Easy fabrication techniques resulting in structurally aligned fiber implants; 2) Versatile and reliable in vivo performance; 3) Robust long&#8208;term operation in vivo system.








Abstract
Neural probe engineering is a dynamic field, driving innovation in neuroscience and addressing scientific and medical demands. Recent advancements involve integrating nanomaterials to improve performance, aiming for sustained in vivo functionality. However, challenges persist due to size, stiffness, complexity, and manufacturing intricacies. To address these issues, a neural interface utilizing freestanding CNT&#8208;sheets drawn from CNT&#8208;forests integrated onto thermally drawn functional polymer fibers is proposed. This approach yields a device with structural alignment, resulting in exceptional electrical, mechanical, and electrochemical properties while retaining biocompatibility for prolonged periods of implantation. This Structurally Aligned Multifunctional neural Probe (SAMP) employing forest&#8208;drawn CNT sheets demonstrates in vivo capabilities in neural recording, neurotransmitter detection, and brain/spinal cord circuit manipulation via optogenetics, maintaining functionality for over a year post&#8208;implantation. The straightforward fabrication method's versatility, coupled with the device's functional reliability, underscores the significance of this technique in the next&#8208;generation carbon&#8208;based implants. Moreover, the device's longevity and multifunctionality position it as a promising platform for long&#8208;term neuroscience research.

         <title>Self&#8208;Lubricating, Living Contact Lenses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A living hydrogel with embedded biofactories of hyaluronic acid allows the development of contact lens prototypes with permanent self&#8208;lubrication and full transparency. Lubricant release is adjusted by the mechanical and diffusional properties of the hydrogel and regulated by the availability of nutrients in simulated tear fluid.








Abstract
The increasing prevalence of dry eye syndrome in aging and digital societies compromises long&#8208;term contact lens (CL) wear and forces users to regular eye drop instillation to alleviate discomfort. Here a novel approach with the potential to improve and extend the lubrication properties of CLs is presented. This is achieved by embedding lubricant&#8208;secreting biofactories within the CL material. The self&#8208;replenishable reservoirs autonomously produce and release hyaluronic acid (HA), a natural lubrication and wetting agent, long term. The hydrogel matrix regulates the growth of the biofactories and the HA production, and allows the diffusion of nutrients and HA for at least 3 weeks. The continuous release of HA sustainably reduces the friction coefficient of the CL surface. A self&#8208;lubricating CL prototype is presented, where the functional biofactories are contained in a functional ring at the lens periphery, outside of the vision area. The device is cytocompatible and fulfils physicochemical requirements of commercial CLs. The fabrication process is compatible with current manufacturing processes of CLs for vision correction. It is envisioned that the durable&#8208;by&#8208;design approach in living CL could enable long&#8208;term wear comfort for CL users and minimize the need for lubricating eye drops.

         <title>A Biohybrid Self&#8208;Dispersing Miniature Machine Using Wild Oat Fruit Awns for Reforestation and Precision Agriculture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A plant&#8208;inspired, miniaturized, autonomous hybrid machine mimicking Avena fruits (called HybriBot) is proposed. It combines a biodegradable cargo capsule with two natural humidity&#8208;driven sister awns as biological actuators. HybriBot can navigate soil irregularities, achieving forces comparable to natural counterparts, and is functionalized with fertilizers and seeds, successfully germinating diaspores for applications in reforestation and precision agriculture.








Abstract
Advances in bioinspired and biohybrid robotics are enabling the creation of multifunctional systems able to explore complex unstructured environments. Inspired by Avena fruits, a biohybrid miniaturized autonomous machine (HybriBot) composed of a biomimetic biodegradable capsule as cargo delivery system and natural humidity&#8208;driven sister awns as biological motors is reported. Microcomputed tomography, molding via two&#8208;photon polymerization and casting of natural awns into biodegradable materials is employed to fabricate multiple HybriBots capable of exploring various soil and navigating soil irregularities, such as holes and cracks. These machines replicate the dispersal movements and biomechanical performances of natural fruits, achieving comparable capsule drag forces up to &#8776;0.38 N and awns torque up to &#8776;100 mN mm&#8722;1. They are functionalized with fertilizer and are successfully utilized to germinate selected diaspores. HybriBots function as self&#8208;dispersed systems with applications in reforestation and precision agriculture.

         <title>A Versatile Synthesis Platform Based on Polymer Cubosomes for a Library of Highly Ordered Nanoporous Metal Oxides Particles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>

A library of ordered nanoporous metal oxide particles with different compositions and periodicity is designed and synthesized via a general and flexible polymer cubosome templating strategy. Due to their favorable porosity and rich active sites, the obtained nanoporous metal oxides, for example, tungsten oxides exhibit excellent gas sensing performances to low&#8208;concentration H2S.








Abstract
Polymer cubosomes (PCs) have well&#8208;defined inverse bicontinuous cubic mesophases formed by amphiphilic block copolymer bilayers. The open hydrophilic channels, large periods, and robust physical properties of PCs are advantageous to many host&#8211;guest interactions and yet not fully exploited, especially in the fields of functional nanomaterials. Here, the self&#8208;assembly of poly(ethylene oxide)&#8208;block&#8208;polystyrene block copolymers is systematically investigated and a series of robust PCs is developed via a cosolvent method. Ordered nanoporous metal oxide particles are obtained by selectively filling the hydrophilic channels of PCs via an impregnation strategy, followed by a two&#8208;step thermal treatment. Based on this versatile PC platform, the general synthesis of a library of ordered porous particles with different pore structures 3&#175;$\bar{3}$ 3&#175;$\bar{3}$, tunable large pore size (18&#8211;78&#160;nm), high specific surface areas (up to 123.3&#160;m2&#160;g&#8722;1 for WO3) and diverse framework compositions, such as transition and non&#8208;transition metal oxides, rare earth chloride oxides, perovskite, pyrochlore, and high&#8208;entropy metal oxides is demonstrated. As typical materials obtained via this method, ordered porous WO3 particles have the advantages of open continuous structure and semiconducting properties, thus showing superior gas sensing performances toward hydrogen sulfide.

         <title>Eliminating the Adverse Impact of Composition Modulation in Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes toward Ultra&#8208;High Brightness and Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The component modulation&#8208;induced ion doping of perovskite emitters and the underlying mechanism of the nature instability are revealed for FAPbI3&#8208;based NIR PeLEDs with excess organic halides. By eliminating adverse effects of the excessively incorporated organoammonium halides using a surface clean&#8208;assisted crosslinking strategy, a high efficiency of 23.6%, a high radiance of 964 W&#8201;sr&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2, and an excellent half&#8208;lifetime of 106.1 h are achieved simultaneously.








Abstract
Excess ammonium halides as composition additives are widely employed in perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs), aiming to achieve high performance by controlling crystallinity and passivating defects. However, an in&#8208;depth understanding of whether excess organoammonium components affect the film physical/electrical properties and the resultant device instability is still lacking. Here, the trade&#8208;off between the performance and stability in high&#8208;efficiency formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3)&#8208;based PeLEDs with excess ammonium halides is pointed, and the underlying mechanism is explored. Systematic experimental and theoretical studies reveal that excess halide salt&#8208;induced ion&#8208;doping largely alters the PeLEDs properties (e.g., carrier injection, field&#8208;dependent ion&#8208;drifting, defect physics, and phase stability). A surface clean assisted cross&#8208;linking strategy is demonstrated to eliminate the adverse impact of composition modulation and boost the operational stability without sacrificing the efficiency, achieving a high efficiency of 23.6%, a high radiance of 964 W&#8201;sr&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2 (The highest value for FAPbI3 based PeLEDs), and a prolong lifetime of 106.1 h at large direct current density (100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2), concurrently. The findings uncovered an important link between excess halide salts and the device performance, providing a guideline for rational design of stable, bright, and high efficiency PeLEDs.

         <title>Self&#8208;Charging Aqueous Zn//COF Battery with UltraHigh Self&#8208;Charging Efficiency and Rate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient air self&#8208;charging Zn//COF&#8208;PTO battery is developed. COF&#8208;PTO spontaneously forms metal heterocyclic complexes with zinc ions (step 2) to promote the self&#8208;charging reaction (step 1), which is a mechanism similar to Le Chatelier's principle in chemical reactions. Therefore, Zn//COF&#8208;PTO batteries exhibit excellent self&#8208;charging efficiency (&#951;) and average self&#8208;charging rate (&#957;).








Abstract
Self&#8208;charging zinc batteries that combine energy harvesting technology with batteries are candidates for reliable self&#8208;charging power systems. However, the lack of rational materials design results in unsatisfactory self&#8208;charging performance. Here, a covalent organic framework containing pyrene&#8208;4,5,9,10&#8208;tetraone groups (COF&#8208;PTO) is reported as a cathode material for aqueous self&#8208;charging zinc batteries. The ordered channel structure of the COF&#8208;PTO provides excellent capacity retention of 98% after 18 000 cycles at 10 A g&#8722;1 and ultra&#8208;fast ion transfer. To visually assess the self&#8208;charging performance, two parameters, namely self&#8208;charging efficiency (self&#8208;charging discharge capacity/galvanostatic discharge capacity, &#951;) and average self&#8208;charging rate (total discharge capacity after cyclic self&#8208;charging/total cyclic self&#8208;charging time, &#957;), are proposed for performance evaluation. COF&#8208;PTO achieves an impressive &#951; of 96.9% and an &#957; of 30&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 self&#8208;charge capacity per hour in 100 self&#8208;charging cycles, surpassing the previous reports. Mechanism studies reveal the co&#8208;insertion of Zn2+ and H+ double ions in COF&#8208;PTO of self&#8208;charging zinc batteries. In addition, the C&#9552;N and C&#9552;O (on the benzene) in COF&#8208;PTO are ortho structures to each other, which can easily form metal heterocycles with Zn ions, thereby driving the forward progress of the self&#8208;charging reaction and enhancing the self&#8208;charging performance.

         <title>Entangled Mesh Hydrogels with Macroporous Topologies via Cryogelation for Rapid Atmospheric Water Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal network engineering is proposed to develop the entangled&#8208;mesh hydrogels (EMHs) with a distinct aerogel&#8208;like macroporous topology, exhibiting a significantly improved mass transport property compared with the conventional dense hydrogels&#160;by regular polymerization. As such, the hygroscopic EMHs deliver remarkably faster moisture sorption and solar&#8208;driven water desorption kinetics, achieving high&#8208;performance sorption&#8208;based atmospheric water harvesting.








Abstract
Sorption&#8208;based atmospheric water harvesting (SAWH) is a promising technology to alleviate freshwater scarcity. Recently, hygroscopic salt&#8208;hydrogel composites (HSHCs) have emerged as attractive candidates with their high water uptake, versatile designability, and scale&#8208;up fabrication. However, achieving high&#8208;performance SAWH applications for HSHCs has been challenging because of their sluggish kinetics, attributed to their limited mass transport properties. Herein, a universal network engineering of hydrogels using a cryogelation method is presented, significantly improving the SAWH kinetics of HSHCs. As a result of the entangled mesh confinements formed during cryogelation, a stable macroporous topology is attained and maintained within the obtained entangled&#8208;mesh hydrogels (EMHs), leading to significantly enhanced mass transport properties compared to conventional dense hydrogels (CDHs). With it, corresponding hygroscopic EMHs (HEMHs) simultaneously exhibit faster moisture sorption and solar&#8208;driven water desorption. Consequently, a rapid&#8208;cycling HEMHs&#8208;based harvester delivers a practical freshwater production of 2.85 Lwater kgsorbents&#8722;1 day&#8722;1 via continuous eight sorption/desorption cycles, outperforming other state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art hydrogel&#8208;based sorbents. Significantly, the generalizability of this strategy is validated by extending it to other hydrogels used in HSHCs. Overall, this work offers a new approach to efficiently address long&#8208;standing challenges of sluggish kinetics in current HSHCs, promoting them toward the next&#8208;generation SAWH applications.

         <title>Stabilization of Lattice Oxygen Evolution Reactions in Oxophilic Ce&#8208;Mediated Bi/BiCeO1.8H Electrocatalysts for Efficient Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolyzers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Bi/BiCeO1.8H containing under&#8208;coordinated oxygen atoms is proposed and demonstrated for lattice oxygen redox&#8208;catalyzed oxygen evolution electrocatalysts using a simple electrosynthesis. Bi/BiCeO1.8H&#8208;based anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE) exhibits a low cell voltage of 1.79 V and catalytic stability for 100 h at a practically high current density of 1 A cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
The lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) offers an efficient reaction pathway for oxygen evolution reactions (OERs) in energy storage and conversion systems. Owing to the involvement of active lattice oxygen enhancing electrochemical activity, addressing the structural and electrochemical stabilities of LOM materials is crucial. Herein, a heterostructure (Bi/BiCeO1.8H) containing abundant under&#8208;coordinated oxygen atoms having oxygen nonbonding states is synthesized by a simple electrochemical deposition method. Given the difference in reduction potentials between Bi and Ce, partially reduced Bi nanoparticles and surrounding under&#8208;coordinated oxygen atoms are generated in BiCeO1.8H. It is found that the lattice oxygen can be activated as a reactant of the OER when the valence state of Bi increases to Bi5+, leading to increased metal&#8211;oxygen covalency and that the oxophilic Ce3+/4+ redox couple can maintain the Bi nanoparticles and surrounding under&#8208;coordinated oxygen atoms by preventing over&#8208;oxidation of Bi. The anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer with Bi/BiCeO1.8H exhibits a low cell voltage of 1.79 V even at a high practical current density of 1.0 A cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the cell performance remains significantly stable over 100 h with only a 2.2% increase in the initial cell voltage, demonstrating sustainable lattice oxygen redox.

         <title>A Comprehensive Strategy Based on High Clinical Translational Nanosystem for Programmable Immunotherapy of Triple Negative Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Schematic of the multifunctional nanosystem (FeSH NPs) with high clinical translational potential preparation with sodium hyaluronate (HA), salvianolic acid B (SAB) and Fe3+, and their application in photothermal&#8208;immunotherapy are demonstrated. In particular, combined with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibody is shown for comprehensive procedural therapy of immunologically cold tumors triple negative breast cancer (TNBCs).








Abstract
Triple negative breast cancer (TNBCs), known as an immunologically cold tumor, is difficult to completely eliminate with existing monotherapies, let alone metastasis and recurrence. It is urgent to design a rational combination of multiple therapies to programmatically reconstitute tumor microenvironment (TME) and reverse the immune &#8220;cold&#8221; into &#8220;hot&#8221; inflammatory tumors to improve the therapeutic effect. Hence, in this work, a multifunctional nanosystem (FeSH NPs) that integrates metal&#8208;polyphenol coordination complex as a photothermal agent and polyphenol, salvianolic acid B (SAB) as immunomodulator is designed and fabricated for synergistic photothermal&#8208;immunotherapy of TNBCs combined with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibody. Guided by photothermal/photoacoustic dual&#8208;mode imaging, photothermal therapy (PTT) caused by FeSH NPs induces immunogenic cell death (ICD) under 808&#160;nm laser irradiation. Subsequently, the loaded SAB is released with the addition of deferoxamine mesylate (DFO) to remodel TME, specifically TGF&#8208;&#946; inhibition and PD&#8208;L1 upregulation, and eliminate the primary tumors. The combination of PTT and TME reprogramming by FeSH NPs further synergizes with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibody to eradicate recurrence and inhibit metastasis of TNBCs concurrently. Given the biosafety of FeSH NPs throughout the lifecycle, this work provides a protocol with high clinical translational promise for comprehensive programmed therapeutics of immunologically cold tumors TNBCs.

         <title>Intrahippocampal Supramolecular Assemblies Directed Bioorthogonal Liberation of Neurotransmitters to Suppress Seizures in Freely Moving Mice</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An imbalance between neuronal inhibition and excitation may lead to the onset of epilepsy. In this study, bioorthogonal decaging reactions and photolysis enable on&#8208;demand drug release to address the deficiency of an inhibitory neurotransmitter (GABA) during seizure symptoms. Such a spatiotemporal&#8208;controlled drug delivery system is applicable for managing epileptic seizures with an unprovoked nature.








Abstract
The precise delivery of anti&#8208;seizure medications (ASM) to epileptic loci remains the major challenge to treat epilepsy without causing adverse drug reactions. The unprovoked nature of epileptic seizures raises the additional need to release ASMs in a spatiotemporal controlled manner. Targeting the oxidative stress in epileptic lesions, here the reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced in situ supramolecular assemblies that synergized bioorthogonal reactions to deliver inhibitory neurotransmitter (GABA) on&#8208;demand, are developed. Tetrazine&#8208;bearing assembly precursors undergo oxidation and selectively self&#8208;assemble under pathological conditions inside primary neurons and mice brains. Assemblies induce local accumulation of tetrazine in the hippocampus CA3 region, which allows the subsequent bioorthogonal release of inhibitory neurotransmitters. For induced acute seizures, the sustained release of GABA extends the suppression than the direct supply of GABA. In the model of permanent damage of CA3, bioorthogonal ligation on assemblies provides a reservoir of GABA that behaves prompt release upon 365&#160;nm irradiation. Incorporated with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art microelectrode arrays, it is elucidated that the bioorthogonal release of GABA shifts the neuron spike waveforms to suppress seizures at the single&#8208;neuron precision. The strategy of in situ supramolecular assemblies&#8208;directed bioorthogonal prodrug activation shall be promising for the effective delivery of ASMs to treat epilepsy.

         <title>Observation of Omnidirectional Exchange Bias at All&#8208;Antiferromagnetic Polycrystalline Heterointerface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An exchange bias effect at an all&#8208;antiferromagnetic polycrystalline heterointerface is observed. The chiral antiferromagnet Mn3Sn works as the active layer, replacing conventional ferromagnets. The unidirectional magnetic anisotropy can be determined omnidirectionally due to the absence of the shape anisotropy. These findings are significant for developing various antiferromagnetic spintronic devices, including antiferromagnetic tunnel junctions, essential for ultrafast and ultra&#8208;power&#8208;efficient computing.








Abstract
Due to promising functionalities that may dramatically enhance spintronics performance, antiferromagnets are the subject of intensive research for developing the next&#8208;generation active elements to replace ferromagnets. In particular, the recent experimental demonstration of tunneling magnetoresistance and electrical switching using chiral antiferromagnets has sparked expectations for the practical integration of antiferromagnetic materials into device architectures. To further develop the technology to manipulate the magnetic anisotropies in all&#8208;antiferromagnetic devices, it is essential to realize exchange bias through the interface between antiferromagnetic multilayers. Here, the first observation on the omnidirectional exchange bias at an all&#8208;antiferromagnetic polycrystalline heterointerface is reported. This experiment demonstrates that the interfacial energy causing the exchange bias between the chiral&#8208;antiferromagnet Mn3Sn/collinear&#8208;antiferromagnet MnN layers is comparable to those found at the conventional ferromagnet/antiferromagnet interface at room temperature. In sharp contrast with previous reports using ferromagnets, the magnetic field control of the unidirectional anisotropy is found to be omnidirectional due to the absence of the shape anisotropy in the antiferromagnetic multilayer. The realization of the omnidirectional exchange bias at the interface between polycrystalline antiferromagnets on amorphous templates, highly compatible with existing Si&#8208;based devices, paves the way for developing ultra&#8208;low power and ultra&#8208;high speed memory devices based on antiferromagnets.

         <title>Multiphase Under&#8208;Liquid Biofabrication With Living Soft Matter: A Route to Customize Functional Architectures With Microbial Nanocellulose</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under&#8208;liquid biofabrication utilizes oxygen transport through an oil phase to sustain aerobic bacterial activity at liquid&#8211;liquid interfaces. This technique combines multiphase systems with living matter to open new opportunities to advance cellulose&#8208;based architectures through soft templating, including those based on capsules, porous materials, filaments, layered film composites, and Janus membranes.








Abstract
The growth of aerobic microbes at air&#8211;water interfaces typically leads to biofilm formation. Herein, a fermentative alternative that relies on oil&#8211;water interfaces to support bacterial activity and aerotaxis is introduced. The process uses under&#8208;liquid biofabrication by structuring bacterial nanocellulose (BNC) to achieve tailorable architectures. Cellulose productivity in static conditions is first evaluated using sets of oil homologues, classified in order of polarity. The oils are shown for their ability to sustain bacterial growth and BNC production according to air transfer and solubilization, both of which impact the physiochemical properties of the produced biofilms. The latter are investigated in terms of their morphological (fibril size and network density), structural (crystallinity) and physical&#8211;mechanical (surface area and strength) features. The introduced under&#8208;liquid biofabrication is demonstrated for the generation of BNC&#8208;based macroscale architectures and compartmentalized soft matter.

     alt="Multiphase Under-Liquid Biofabrication With Living Soft Matter: A Route to Customize Functional Architectures With Microbial Nanocellulose"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under-liquid biofabrication utilizes oxygen transport through an oil phase to sustain aerobic bacterial activity at liquid&#8211;liquid interfaces. This technique combines multiphase systems with living matter to open new opportunities to advance cellulose-based architectures through soft templating, including those based on capsules, porous materials, filaments, layered film composites, and Janus membranes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The growth of aerobic microbes at air&#8211;water interfaces typically leads to biofilm formation. Herein, a fermentative alternative that relies on oil&#8211;water interfaces to support bacterial activity and aerotaxis is introduced. The process uses under-liquid biofabrication by structuring bacterial nanocellulose (BNC) to achieve tailorable architectures. Cellulose productivity in static conditions is first evaluated using sets of oil homologues, classified in order of polarity. The oils are shown for their ability to sustain bacterial growth and BNC production according to air transfer and solubilization, both of which impact the physiochemical properties of the produced biofilms. The latter are investigated in terms of their morphological (fibril size and network density), structural (crystallinity) and physical&#8211;mechanical (surface area and strength) features. The introduced under-liquid biofabrication is demonstrated for the generation of BNC-based macroscale architectures and compartmentalized soft matter. This can be accomplished following three different routes, namely, 3D under-liquid networking (multi-layer hydrogels/composites), emulsion templating (capsules, emulgels, porous materials), and anisotropic layering (Janus membranes).

         <title>Knotted Artificial Muscles for Bio&#8208;Mimetic Actuation under Deepwater</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel type of artificial muscles is proposed from intricately knotted liquid crystal elastomer fibers, capable of high stroke, and fast linear contractions. These muscles remain functional even when significantly damaged or submerged at depths of 3000 meters underwater, mirroring the remarkable robustness and adaptability of their natural counterparts.








Abstract
Muscles featuring high frequency and high stroke linear actuation are essential for animals to achieve superior maneuverability, agility, and environmental adaptability. Artificial muscles are yet to match their biological counterparts, due to inferior actuation speed, magnitude, mode, or adaptability. Inspired by the hierarchical structure of natural muscles, artificial muscles are created that are powerful, responsive, robust, and adaptable. The artificial muscles consist of knots braided from 3D printed liquid crystal elastomer fibers and thin heating threads. The unique hierarchical, braided knot structure offers amplified linear stroke, force rate, and damage&#8208;tolerance, as verified by both numerical simulations and experiments. In particular, the square knotted artificial muscle shows reliable cycles of actuation at 1Hz in 3000m depth underwater. Potential application is demonstrated by propelling a model boat. Looking ahead, the knotted artificial muscles can empower novel biomedical devices and soft robots to explore various environments, from inside human body to the mysterious deep&#160;sea.

         <title>An Encapsulation&#8208;Free and Hierarchical Porous Triboelectric Scaffold with Dynamic Hydrophilicity for Efficient Cartilage Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes the concept of triboelectric scaffolds (TESs). During degradation, the TESs exhibit hydrophilicity on the surface for tissue regeneration while hydrophobicity in interior micropores for triboelectric therapy. TESs provide a new platform technology for tissue engineering. The device design successfully addresses the challenge of encapsulation&#8208;free triboelectric nanogenerators (TENG) in vivo and will broaden their applications.








Abstract
Tissue engineering and electrotherapy are two promising methods to promote tissue repair. However, their integration remains an underexplored area, because their requirements on devices are usually distinct. Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have shown great potential to develop self&#8208;powered devices. However, due to their susceptibility to moisture, TENGs have to be encapsulated in vivo. Therefore, existing TENGs cannot be employed as tissue engineering scaffolds, which require direct interaction with surrounding cells. Here, the concept of triboelectric scaffolds (TESs) is proposed. Poly(glycerol sebacate), a biodegradable and relatively hydrophobic elastomer, is selected as the matrix of TESs. Each hydrophobic micropore in multi&#8208;hierarchical porous TESs efficiently serves as a moisture&#8208;resistant working unit of TENGs. Integration of tons of micropores ensures the electrotherapy ability of TESs in vivo without encapsulation. Originally hydrophobic TESs are degraded by surface erosion and transformed into hydrophilic surfaces, facilitating their role as tissue engineering scaffolds. Notably, TESs seeded with chondrocytes obtain dense and large matured cartilages after subcutaneous implantation in nude mice. Importantly, rabbits with osteochondral defects receiving TES implantation show favorable hyaline cartilage regeneration and complete cartilage healing. This work provides a promising electronic biomedical device and will inspire a series of new in vivo applications.

         <title>Disorder&#8208;Broadened Phase Boundary with Enhanced Amorphous Superconductivity in Pressurized In2Te5</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
According to the Gibbs phase rule, the degree of freedom at conventional phase boundaries is 1 (F = 1). By introducing an intermediate amorphous phase, a rare crystalline&#8211;amorphous&#8211;crystalline transition is achieved and the sharp phase boundary is successfully expanded into a broad region (F = 2) in which the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) is significantly enhanced.








Abstract
As an empirical tool in materials science and engineering, the iconic phase diagram owes its robustness and practicality to the topological characteristics rooted in the celebrated Gibbs phase law free variables (F) = components (C) &#8211; phases (P) + 2. When crossing the phase diagram boundary, the structure transition occurs abruptly, bringing about an instantaneous change in physical properties and limited controllability on the boundaries (F = 1). Here, the sharp phase boundary is expanded to an amorphous transition region (F = 2) by partially disrupting the long&#8208;range translational symmetry, leading to a sequential crystalline&#8211;amorphous&#8211;crystalline (CAC) transition in a pressurized In2Te5 single crystal. Through detailed in situ synchrotron diffraction, it is elucidated that the phase transition stems from the rotation of immobile blocks [In2Te2]2+, linked by hinge&#8208;like [Te3]2&#8722; trimers. Remarkably, within the amorphous region, the amorphous phase demonstrates a notable 25% increase of the superconducting transition temperature (Tc), while the carrier concentration remains relatively constant. Furthermore, a theoretical framework is proposed revealing that the unconventional boost in amorphous superconductivity might be attributed to an intensified electron correlation, triggered by a disorder&#8208;augmented multifractal behavior. These findings underscore the potential of disorder and prompt further exploration of unforeseen phenomena on the phase boundaries.

         <title>Synergizing Fe2O3 Nanoparticles on Single Atom Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C for Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia at Industrial Current Densities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>

Here, the effectiveness of a novel active particle&#8208;active support Fe2O3/Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst is demonstrated for the nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR). In situ X&#8208;ray absorption elucidates a reduction in surface Fe3+ to Fe0, during a pre&#8208;reduction activation step, significantly enhancing the NO3RR activity, enabling a partial current density up to 2 A cm&#8722;2 at near 100% efficiency.








Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of nitrates (NO3&#8722;) enables a pathway for the carbon neutral synthesis of ammonia (NH3), via the nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR), which has been demonstrated at high selectivity. However, to make NH3 synthesis cost&#8208;competitive with current technologies, high NH3 partial current densities (jNH3) must be achieved to reduce the levelized cost of NH3. Here, the high NO3RR activity of Fe&#8208;based materials is leveraged to synthesize a novel active particle&#8208;active support system with Fe2O3 nanoparticles supported on atomically dispersed Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C. The optimized 3&#215;Fe2O3/Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst demonstrates an ultrahigh NO3RR activity, reaching a maximum jNH3 of 1.95 A cm&#8722;2 at a Faradaic efficiency (FE) for NH3 of 100% and an NH3 yield rate over 9 mmol hr&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2. Operando XANES and post&#8208;mortem XPS reveal the importance of a pre&#8208;reduction activation step, reducing the surface Fe2O3 (Fe3+) to highly active Fe0 sites, which are maintained during electrolysis. Durability studies demonstrate the robustness of both the Fe2O3 particles and Fe&#8211;Nx sites at highly cathodic potentials, maintaining a current of &#8722;1.3 A cm&#8722;2 over 24 hours. This work exhibits an effective and durable active particle&#8208;active support system enhancing the performance of the NO3RR, enabling industrially relevant current densities and near 100% selectivity.

Here, the high NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RR activity of Fe-based materials is leveraged to synthesize a novel active particle-active support system with Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles supported on atomically dispersed Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C. The optimized 3&#215;Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst demonstrates an ultrahigh NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RR activity, reaching a maximum j&lt;sub&gt;NH3&lt;/sub&gt; of 1.95 A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at a Faradaic efficiency (FE) for NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; of 100% and an NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; yield rate over 9 mmol hr&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Operando XANES and post-mortem XPS reveal the importance of a pre-reduction activation step, reducing the surface Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;) to highly active Fe&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; sites, which are maintained during electrolysis. Durability studies demonstrate the robustness of both the Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; particles and Fe&#8211;N&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; sites at highly cathodic potentials, maintaining a current of &#8722;1.3 A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; over 24 hours. This work exhibits an effective and durable active particle-active support system enhancing the performance of the NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RR, enabling industrially relevant current densities and near 100% selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Universal Synthesis of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts by Direct Thermal Decomposition of Molten Salts for Boosting Acidic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of noble metal single atoms embedded in non&#8208;noble metal oxides are simply synthesized through the direct thermal decomposition of molten salts. The resultant single&#8208;atom catalysts exhibit outstanding electrocatalytic activity and durability for both of the hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions in acidic media.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are considered prominent materials in the field of catalysis due to their high metal atom utilization and selectivity. However, the wide&#8208;ranging applications of SACs remain a significant challenge due to their complex preparation processes. Here, a universal strategy is reported to prepare a series of noble metal single atoms on different non&#8208;noble metal oxides through a facile one&#8208;step thermal decomposition of molten salts. By using a mixture of non&#8208;noble metal nitrate and a small&#8208;amount noble metal chloride as the precursor, noble metal single atoms can be easily introduced into the non&#8208;noble metal oxide lattice owing to the cation exchange in the in situ formed molten salt, followed by the thermal decomposition of nitrate anions during the heating process. Analyses using aberration&#8208;corrected high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy and extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy confirm the formation of the finely dispersed single atoms. Specially, the as&#8208;synthesized Ir single atoms (10.97 wt%) and Pt single atoms (4.60 wt%) on the Co3O4 support demonstrate outstanding electrocatalytic activities for oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction, respectively.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Highly Stiff and Tough Shape Memory Polyurea with Unprecedented Energy Density by Precise Slight Cross&#8208;Linking</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative approach utilizing a delicate balance of precise covalent bonds and hierarchical supramolecular interactions has resulted in an advanced shape memory polymer. This polymer boasts a unique combination of high stiffness, strength, and toughness, coupled with excellent resistance to humidity and heat, repairability, high energy density, and exceptional energy output, which allows for a wide range of potential applications.








Abstract
Shape memory polymers (SMPs) have attracted significant attention and hold vast potential for diverse applications. Nevertheless, conventional SMPs suffer from notable shortcomings in terms of mechanical properties, environmental stability, and energy density, significantly constraining their practical utility. Here, inspired by the structure of muscle fibers, an innovative approach that involves the precise incorporation of subtle, permanent cross&#8208;linking within a hierarchical hydrogen bonding supramolecular network is reported. This novel strategy has culminated in the development of covalent and supramolecular shape memory polyurea, which exhibits exceptional mechanical properties, including high stiffness (1347&#160;MPa), strength (82.4&#160;MPa), and toughness (312.7&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3), ensuring its suitability for a wide range of applications. Furthermore, it boasts remarkable recyclability and repairability, along with excellent resistance to moisture, heat, and solvents. Moreover, the polymer demonstrates outstanding shape memory effects characterized by a high energy density (24.5&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3), facilitated by the formation of strain&#8208;induced oriented nanostructures that can store substantial amounts of entropic energy. Simultaneously, it maintains a remarkable 96% shape fixity and 99% shape recovery. This delicate interplay of covalent and supramolecular bonds opens up a promising pathway to the creation of high&#8208;performance SMPs, expanding their applicability across various domains.

         <title>The Impact of Local Strain Fields in Noncollinear Antiferromagnetic Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The properties of noncollinear antiferromagnets are highly sensitive to strain, including large local strain fields generated by dislocations. The influence of these on the global magnetization and transport properties is examined, finding that they enhance the magnetization but are deleterious to intrinsic properties important for application. This analysis is timely as efforts are made to integrate these materials into multilayer devices.








Abstract
Antiferromagnets hosting structural or magnetic order that breaks time reversal symmetry are of increasing interest for &#8220;beyond von Neumann&#8221; computing applications because the topology of their band structure allows for intrinsic physical properties, exploitable in integrated memory and logic function. One such group are the noncollinear antiferromagnets. Essential for domain manipulation is the existence of small net moments found routinely when the material is synthesized in thin film form and attributed to symmetry breaking caused by spin canting, either from the Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction or from strain. Although the spin arrangement of these materials makes them highly sensitive to strain, there is little understanding about the influence of local strain fields caused by lattice defects on global properties, such as magnetization and anomalous Hall effect. This premise is investigated by examining noncollinear antiferromagnetic films that are either highly lattice mismatched or closely matched to their substrate. In either case, edge dislocation networks are generated and for the former case, these extend throughout the entire film thickness, creating large local strain fields. These strain fields allow for finite intrinsic magnetization in seemingly structurally relaxed films and influence the antiferromagnetic domain state and the intrinsic anomalous Hall effect.

         <title>Tailored Fabrication of Full&#8208;Color Ultrastable Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Carbon Dots Composites with Unexpected Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Composites of carbon dots and urea that exhibit full&#8208;color, long&#8208;life, high&#8208;quantum yield, ultrastable, room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence, along with thermosensitive delayed fluorescence, are developed, and these are applied to higher&#8208;level information encryption and in vivo imaging. The precise control of the singlet&#8211;triplet splitting of carbon dots through precursor engineering introduces a new method to realize smart dual&#8208;channel afterglow materials.








Abstract
The development of single&#8208;system materials that exhibit both multicolor room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) with tunable after glow colors and channels is challenging. In this study, four metal&#8208;free carbon dots (CDs) are developed through structural tailoring, and panchromatic high&#8208;brightness RTP is achieved via strong chemical encapsulation in urea. The maximum lifetime and quantum yield reaches 2141 ms and 56.55%, respectively. Moreover, CDs&#8208;IV@urea, prepared via coreshell interaction engineering, exhibits a dual afterglow of red RTP and green TADF. The degree of conjugation and functional groups of precursors affects the binding interactions of the nitrogen cladding on CDs, which in turn stabilizes triplet energy levels and affects the energy gap between S1 and T1 (&#916;EST) to induce multicolor RTP. The enhanced wrapping interaction lowers the &#916;EST, promoting reverse intersystem crossing, which leads to phosphorescence and TADF. This strong coreshell interaction fully stabilizes the triplet state, thus stabilizing the material in water, even in extreme environments such as strong acids and oxidants. These afterglow materials are tested in multicolor, time, and temperature multiencryption as well as in multicolor in vivo bioimaging. Hence, these materials have promising practical applications in information security as well as biomedical diagnosis and treatment.

         <title>Thermal Radiation Annealing for Overcoming Processing Temperature Limitation of Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high&#8208;thermal tolerance flexible perovskite solar cells with excellent mechanical stability are successfully achieved by a new thermal radiation annealing methodology, which aids in the vertical growth of perovskite grains, reduction of grain boundaries, and decrease of lattice mismatch. These microstructural improvements are essential in enhancing the performance of flexible perovskite photovoltaics.








Abstract
Common polymeric conductive electrodes, such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) coated with indium tin oxide, face a major challenge due to their low processing&#8208;temperature limits, attributed to PET's low glass transition temperature (Tg) of (70&#8211;80&#160;&#176;C). This limitation significantly narrows the scope of material selection, limits the processing techniques applicable to the low Tg, and hinders the ripened technology transfer from glass substrates to them. Addressing the temperature constraints of the flexible substrates is impactful yet underexplored, with broader implications for fields beyond photovoltaics. Here, a new thermal radiation annealing methodology is introduced to address this issue. By applying the above Tg radiation annealing in conjunction with thermoelectric cooling, highly ordered molecular packing on PET substrates is successfully created, which is exclusively unachievable due to PET's low thermal tolerance. As a result, in the context of perovskite solar cells, this approach enables the circumvention of high&#8208;temperature annealing limitations of PET substrates, leading to a remarkable flexible device efficiency of 22.61% and a record fill factor of 83.42%. This approach proves especially advantageous for advancing the field of flexible optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Molten Guest&#8208;Mediated Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Featuring Multi&#8208;Modal Supramolecular Interaction Sites for Flame&#8208;Retardant Superionic Conductor in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A flame&#8208;retardant all&#8208;solid&#8208;state metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) superionic conductor is constructed, incorporating multiple supramolecular interactions through the embedding of molten polar crystalline organic electrolyte into the anionic nanochannels. The distinctive nanochannels exhibit selective acceleration of Li+ transport within various negative electrostatic chemical environments, concurrently suppressing movement of anions, enabling stable operation of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density solid&#8208;state full cells under constrained conditions.








Abstract
The development of solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) with outstanding comprehensive performance is currently a critical challenge for achieving high energy density and safer solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs). In this study, a strategy of nano&#8208;confined in situ solidification is proposed to create a novel category of molten guest&#8208;mediated metal&#8211;organic frameworks, named MGM&#8211;MOFs. By embedding the newly developed molten crystalline organic electrolyte (ML20) into the nanocages of anionic MOF&#8211;OH, MGM&#8211;MOF&#8211;OH, characterized by multi&#8208;modal supramolecular interaction sites and continuous negative electrostatic environments within nano&#8208;channels, is achieved. These nanochannels promote ion transport through the successive hopping of Li+ between neighbored negative electrostatic environments and suppress anion movement through the chemical constraint of the hydroxyl&#8208;functionalized pore wall. This results in remarkable Li+ conductivity of 7.1 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 and high Li+ transference number of 0.81. Leveraging these advantages, the SSBs assembled with MGM&#8211;MOF&#8211;OH exhibit impressive cycle stability and a high specific energy density of 410.5&#160;Wh kganode + cathode + electrolyte&#8722;1 under constrained conditions and various working temperatures. Unlike flammable traditional MOFs, MGM&#8211;MOF&#8211;OH demonstrates high robustness under various harsh conditions, including ignition, high voltage, and extended to humidity.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly for Creating Vertically&#8208;Aligned Graphene Micro Helices with Monolayer Graphene as Chiral Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vertically&#8208;aligned graphene helices are created through a dual&#8208;component self&#8208;assembly process, designed to generate optical chirality specifically in the terahertz (THz) range. The configuration of these vertical helices is predetermined and programmed prior to the assembly process. Once formed, the continuous monolayer graphene helices in this vertical alignment exhibit pronounced optical chirality, rendering them exceptionally suitable for applications within the THz spectrum.








Abstract
Graphene's emergence enables creating chiral metamaterials in helical shapes for terahertz (THz) applications, overcoming material limitations. However, practical implementation remains theoretical due to fabrication challenges. This paper introduces a dual&#8208;component self&#8208;assembly technique that enables creating vertically&#8208;aligned continuous monolayer graphene helices at microscale with great flexibility and high controllability. This assembly process not only facilitates the creation of 3D microstructures, but also positions the 3D structures from a horizontal to a vertical orientation, achieving an aspect ratio (height/width) of &#8776;2700. As a result, an array of vertically&#8208;aligned graphene helices is formed, reaching up to 4&#160;mm in height, which is equivalent to 4 million times the height of monolayer graphene. The benefit of these 3D chiral structures made from graphene is their capability to infinitely extend in height, interacting with light in ways that are not possible with traditional 2D layering methods. Such an impressive height elevates a level of interaction with light that far surpasses what is achievable with traditional 2D layering methods, resulting in a notable enhancement of optical chirality properties. This approach is applicable to various 2D materials, promising advancements in innovative research and diverse applications across fields.

         <title>Rapid Selenoprotein Activation by Selenium Nanoparticles to Suppresses Osteoclastogenesis and Pathological Bone Loss</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports the prompt activation of selenoproteins by lentinan&#8208;functionalized selenium nanoparticles to suppress osteoclastogenesis and pathological bone loss through upregulating GPx1 to repolarize macrophages. Moreover, the utilization of bioactive selenium species presents a promising avenue for effectively managing bone disorders, with considerable potential for clinical translation.








Abstract
Osteoclast hyperactivation stands as a significant pathological factor contributing to the emergence of bone disorders driven by heightened oxidative stress levels. The modulation of the redox balance to scavenge reactive oxygen species emerges as a viable approach to addressing this concern. Selenoproteins, characterized by selenocysteine (SeCys2) as the active center, are crucial for selenium&#8208;based antioxidative stress therapy for inflammatory diseases. This study reveals that surface&#8208;active elemental selenium (Se) nanoparticles, particularly lentinan&#8208;Se (LNT&#8208;Se), exhibit enhanced cellular accumulation and accelerated metabolism to SeCys2, the primary active Se form in biological systems. Consequently, LNT&#8208;Se demonstrates significant inhibition of osteoclastogenesis. Furthermore, in vivo studies underscore the superior therapeutic efficacy of LNT&#8208;Se over SeCys2, potentially attributable to the enhanced stability and safety profile of LNT&#8208;Se. Specifically, LNT&#8208;Se effectively modulates the expression of the selenoprotein GPx1, thereby exerting regulatory control over osteoclastogenesis inhibition, and the prevention of osteolysis. In summary, these results suggest that the prompt activation of selenoproteins by Se nanoparticles serves to suppress osteoclastogenesis and pathological bone loss by upregulating GPx1. Moreover, the utilization of bioactive Se species presents a promising avenue for effectively managing bone disorders.

1D covalent organic framework (COF) fibers obtained by processing of COF dispersions using a wet spinning technique: Dispersions of 2D COFs are continuously processed into flexible solid fibers on a large scale using a wet spinning approach. These COF fibers with excellent tensile properties exhibit good performance for the capture of osmotic energy as ionic conductors.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance covalent organic framework (COF) fibers are demanded for an efficient capturing of blue osmotic power because of their excellent durability, simple integration, and large scalability. However, the scalable production of COF fibers is still very challenging due to the poor solubility and fragile structure of COFs. Herein, for the first time, it is reported that COF dispersions can be continuously processed into macroscopic, meter&#8208;long, and pure COF fibers using a wet spinning approach. The two presented COF fibers can be directly used for capturing of osmotic energy, avoiding the production of composite materials that require other additives and face challenges such as phase separation and environmental issues induced by the additives. A COF fiber exhibits power densities of 70.2 and 185.3 W m&#8722;2 at 50&#8208;fold and 500&#8208;fold salt gradients, respectively. These values outperform those of most reported systems, which indicate the high potential of COF fibers for capturing of blue osmotic energy.

         <title>Annual Energy&#8208;Saving Smart Windows with Actively Controllable Passive Radiative Cooling and Multimode Heating Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This smart window not only achieves multistage passive radiative cooling (PRC) efficiency in hot climates but also possesses the capability to deal with complicated heating scenarios due to the combination of triple heating modes including passive radiative heating (PRH), solar heating (SH), and electric heating (EH), which provides a feasible way for on&#8208;demand thermal management and reducing year&#8208;round heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) energy loads.








Abstract
Smart windows with radiative heat management capability using the sun and outer space as zero&#8208;energy thermodynamic resources have gained prominence, demonstrating a minimum carbon footprint. However, realizing on&#8208;demand thermal management throughout all seasons while reducing fossil energy consumption remains a formidable challenge. Herein, an energy&#8208;efficient smart window that enables actively tunable passive radiative cooling (PRC) and multimode heating regulation is demonstrated by integrating the emission&#8208;enhanced polymer&#8208;dispersed liquid crystal (SiO2@PRC PDLC) film and a low&#8208;emission layer deposited with carbon nanotubes. Specifically, this device can achieve a temperature close to the chamber interior ambient under solar irradiance of 700&#160;W m&#8722;2, as well as a temperature drop of 2.3&#160;&#176;C at sunlight of 500&#160;W m&#8722;2, whose multistage PRC efficiency can be rapidly adjusted by a moderate voltage. Meanwhile, synchronous cooperation of passive radiative heating (PRH), solar heating (SH), and electric heating (EH) endows this smart window with the capability to handle complicated heating situations during cold weather. Energy simulation reveals the substantial superiority of this device in energy savings compared with single&#8208;layer SiO2@PRC PDLC, normal glass, and commercial low&#8208;E glass when applied in different climate zones. This work provides a feasible pathway for year&#8208;round thermal management, presenting a huge potential in energy&#8208;saving applications.

         <title>Tuneable Current Rectification Through a Designer Graphene Nanoribbon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of substitutional boron dopants inside a semiconducting graphene nanoribbon localizes a positive&#8208;ion resonance within its bandgap, creating a double&#8208;barrier resonant electronic device. Electric transport through this single&#8208;molecule device suspended between tip and sample of a scanning tunneling microscope reveals unipolar resonant hole tunneling and a peculiar diode effect that can be tuned and reversed with tip&#8208;sample distance.








Abstract
Unimolecular current rectifiers are fundamental building blocks in organic electronics. Rectifying behavior has been identified in numerous organic systems due to electron&#8208;hole asymmetries of orbital levels interfaced by a metal electrode. As a consequence, the rectifying ratio (RR) determining the diode efficiency remains fixed for a chosen molecule&#8208;metal interface. Here, a mechanically tunable molecular diode exhibiting an exceptionally large rectification ratio (&gt;105) and reversible direction is presented. The molecular system comprises a seven&#8208;armchair graphene nanoribbon (GNR) doped with a single unit of substitutional diboron within its structure, synthesized with atomic precision on a gold substrate by on&#8208;surface synthesis. The diboron unit creates half&#8208;populated in&#8208;gap bound states and splits the GNR frontier bands into two segments, localizing the bound state in a double barrier configuration. By suspending these GNRs freely between the tip of a low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscope and the substrate, unipolar hole transport is demonstrated through the boron in&#8208;gap state's resonance. Strong current rectification is observed, associated with the varying widths of the two barriers, which can be tuned by altering the distance between tip and substrate. This study introduces an innovative approach for the precise manipulation of molecular electronic functionalities, opening new avenues for advanced applications in organic&#160;electronics.

         <title>Design of Excellent Mechanical Performances and Magnetic Refrigeration via In Situ Forming Dual&#8208;Phase Alloys</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal and straightforward method for preparing high&#8208;performance magnetocaloric effect (MCE) materials is proposed in this study. By employing a direct melting approach, the magnetocaloric phase precipitates within MCE intermetallic compounds. The prepared dual&#8208;phase alloy achieves a commendable equilibrium between refrigeration capacity and mechanical properties. This strategy holds significant promise for the large&#8208;scale production of magnetic refrigeration materials.








Abstract
Magnetic refrigeration technology can achieve higher energy efficiency based on the magnetocaloric effect (MCE). However, the practical application of MCE materials is hindered by their poor mechanical properties, making them challenging to process into devices. Conventional strengthening strategies usually lead to a trade&#8208;off with refrigeration capacity reduction. Here, a novel design is presented to overcome this dilemma by forming dual&#8208;phase alloys through in situ precipitation of a tough magnetic refrigeration phase within an intermetallic compound with excellent MCE. In the alloy 87.5Gd&#8211;12.5Co, incorporating the interconnected tough phase Gd contributes to enhanced strength (&#8776;505&#160;MPa) with good ductility (&#8776;9.2%). The strengthening phase Gd simultaneously exhibits excellent MCE, enabling the alloy to achieve a peak refrigeration capacity of 720 J kg&#8722;1. Moreover, the alloy shows low thermal expansion induced by the synergistic effect of the two phases. It is beneficial for maintaining structural stability during heat exchange in magnetic refrigeration. The coupling interaction between the two magnetic phases can broaden the refrigeration temperature range and reduce hysteresis. This study guides the development of new high&#8208;performance materials with an excellent combination of mechanical and magnetic refrigeration properties as needed for gas liquefaction and refrigerators.

         <title>Two&#8208;Terminal Perovskite Optoelectronic Synapse for Rapid Trained Neuromorphic Computation with High Accuracy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Leveraging the synergistic effect between ion migration barrier (Ea) and readout voltage (Vread), a stable, reconfigurable, and precisely controllable postsynaptic current is achieved in a dual&#8208;terminal perovskite synapse. The gradual ion accumulation during the training process induces photocurrent evolution, serving as a reference for the dynamic learning rate and boosting accuracy to 97.8% in just 10 epochs.








Abstract
Emerging neural morphological vision sensors inspired by biological systems that integrate image perception, memory, and information computing are expected to transform the landscape of machine vision and artificial intelligence. However, stable and reconfigurable light&#8208;induced synaptic behavior always relies on independent gateport modulation. Despite its potential, the limitations of uncontrollable defects and ionic characteristics have led to simpler, smaller, and more integration&#8208;friendly two&#8208;terminal devices being used as sidelines. In this work, the synergy between ion migration barriers and readout voltage is proven to be the key to realizing stable, reconfigurable, and precisely controllable postsynaptic current in two&#8208;terminal devices. Following the same mechanism, optical and electrical signal synchronous triggering is proposed to serve as a preprocessing method to achieve a recognition accuracy of 96.5%. Impressively, the gradual ion accumulation during the training process induces photocurrent evolution, serving as a reference for the dynamic learning rate and boosting accuracy to 97.8% in just 10 epochs. The PSC modulation potential under short optical pulse of 20 ns is also revealed. This optoelectronic device with perception, memory, and computation capabilities can promote the development of new devices for future photonic neural morphological circuits and artificial vision.

This optoelectronic device with perception, memory, and computation capabilities can promote the development of new devices for future photonic neural morphological circuits and artificial vision.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Toughening Hydrogels with Fibrillar Connected Double Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tough hydrogels with low plastic deformations based on fibrillar connected double networks (fc&#8208;DN) are presented. The efficient transfer of stress between the polyacrylamide and agarose fibril networks via chemical crosslinks and better fibril alignment under stretch result in high fracture strength and toughness (55 MJ m&#8722;3). The fc&#8208;DN provides a new toughening strategy and application potential for load&#8208;bearing soft devices.








Abstract
Biological tissues, such as tendons or cartilage, possess high strength and toughness with very low plastic deformations. In contrast, current strategies to prepare tough hydrogels commonly utilize energy dissipation mechanisms based on physical bonds that lead to irreversible large plastic deformations, thus limiting their load&#8208;bearing applications. This article reports a strategy to toughen hydrogels using fibrillar connected double networks (fc&#8208;DN), which consist of two distinct but chemically interconnected polymer networks, that is, a polyacrylamide network and an acrylated agarose fibril network. The fc&#8208;DN design allows efficient stress transfer between the two networks and high fibril alignment during deformation, both contributing to high strength and toughness, while the chemical crosslinking ensures low plastic deformations after undergoing high strains. The mechanical properties of the fc&#8208;DN network can be readily tuned to reach an ultimate tensile strength of 8 MPa and a toughness of above 55 MJ m&#8722;3, which is 3 and 3.5 times more than that of fibrillar double network hydrogels without chemical connections, respectively. The application potential of the fc&#8208;DN hydrogel is demonstrated as load&#8208;bearing damping material for a jointed robotic lander. The fc&#8208;DN design provides a new toughening mechanism for hydrogels that can be used for soft robotics or bioelectronic applications.

         <title>Boosting External Quantum Efficiency of Blue Perovskite QLEDs Exceeding 23% by Trifluoroacetate Passivation and Mixed Hole Transportation Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Blue perovskite quantum dot&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diode (QLED) with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 23.5% at 490 nm is achieved through a combination of quantum dot (QD) passivated by trifluoroacetate and optimal device design through a mixed hole&#8208;transport layer. The work breaks through the EQE gap of 20% for blue perovskite&#8208;based QLEDs and significantly promotes their commercialization process.








Abstract
Perovskite quantum dot&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs) have been considered a promising display technology due to their wide color gamut for authentic color expression. Currently, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art blue perovskite QLEDs is about 15%, which still lags behind its green and red counterparts (&gt;25%) and blue film&#8208;based LEDs. Here, blue perovskite QLEDs that achieve an EQE of 23.5% at 490&#160;nm is presented, to the best knowledge, which is the highest value reported among blue perovskite&#8208;based LED fields. This impressive efficiency is achieved through a combination of quantum dot (QD) passivation and optimal device design. First, blue mixed halide perovskite CsPbCl3&#8722;xBrx QDs passivated by trifluoroacetate exhibit excellent exciton recombination behavior with a photoluminescence quantum yield of 84% due to reducing uncoordinated Pb surface defects. Furthermore, the device is designed by introducing a mixed hole&#8208;transport layer (M&#8208;HTL) to increase hole injection and transportation capacity and improve carrier balance. It is further found that M&#8208;HTL can decrease carrier leakage and increase radiative recombination in the device, evidenced by the visual electroluminescence spectrum at 2.0&#160;V. The work breaks through the EQE gap of 20% for blue perovskite&#8208;based QLEDs and significantly promotes their commercialization process.

         <title>Heterogeneous Nucleating Agent for High&#8208;Boiling&#8208;Point Nonhalogenated Solvent&#8208;Processed Organic Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The heterogeneous nucleating agent (BTO&#8208;BO) is developed to suppress the excessive aggregation of L8&#8208;BO in high&#8208;boiling&#8208;point nonhalogenated solvents processing, achieving the active layer with high crystallinity and nano&#8208;scaled phase separation morphology. The resultant OSCs achieve record power conversion efficiencies of 19.42% (0.062&#8208;cm2) and 16.35% (15. 03&#8208;cm2) with excellent operational stabilities.








Abstract
High&#8208;boiling&#8208;point nonhalogenated solvents are superior solvents to produce large&#8208;area organic solar cells (OSCs) in industry because of their wide processing window and low toxicity; while, these solvents with slow evaporation kinetics will lead excessive aggregation of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art small molecule acceptors (e.g. L8&#8208;BO), delivering serious efficiency losses. Here, a heterogeneous nucleating agent strategy is developed by grafting oligo (ethylene glycol) side&#8208;chains on L8&#8208;BO (BTO&#8208;BO). The formation energy of the obtained BTO&#8208;BO; while, changing from liquid in a solvent to a crystalline phase, is lower than that of L8&#8208;BO irrespective of the solvent type. When BTO&#8208;BO is added as the third component into the active layer (e.g. PM6:L8&#8208;BO), it easily assembles to form numerous seed crystals, which serve as nucleation sites to trigger heterogeneous nucleation and increase nucleation density of L8&#8208;BO through strong hydrogen bonding interactions even in high&#8208;boiling&#8208;point nonhalogenated solvents. Therefore, it can effectively suppress excessive aggregation during growth, achieving ideal phase&#8208;separation active layer with small domain sizes and high crystallinity. The resultant toluene&#8208;processed OSCs exhibit a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.42% (certificated 19.12%) with excellent operational stability. The strategy also has superior advantages in large&#8208;scale devices, showing a 15.03&#8208;cm2 module with a record PCE of 16.35% (certificated 15.97%).

         <title>Precise Capture and Dynamic Release of Circulating Liver Cancer Cells with Dual&#8208;Histidine&#8208;Based Cell Imprinted Hydrogels</title>

         <dc:description>
Targeting the sialylated glycans present on circulating tumor cells&#8217; (CTCs) surface, an ultrastrong affinity ligand His&#8208;His is designed and integrated into a cell&#8208;imprinting copolymer based on polyethylene glycol dimethacrylate. Precise size matching, specific interactions, and satisfactory biocompatibility endow the material with excellent capabilities for precise capture of CTCs and intact release, significantly facilitating liver cancer early diagnosis and single&#8208;cell multiproteomics analysis.








Abstract
Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) detection presents significant advantages in diagnosing liver cancer due to its noninvasiveness, real&#8208;time monitoring, and dynamic tracking. However, the clinical application of CTCs&#8208;based diagnosis is largely limited by the challenges of capturing low&#8208;abundance CTCs within a complex blood environment while ensuring them alive. Here, an ultrastrong ligand, l&#8208;histidine&#8211;l&#8208;histidine (HH), specifically targeting sialylated glycans on the surface of CTCs, is designed. Furthermore, HH is integrated into a cell&#8208;imprinted polymer, constructing a hydrogel with precise CTCs imprinting, high elasticity, satisfactory blood compatibility, and robust anti&#8208;interference capacities. These features endow the hydrogel with excellent capture efficiency (&gt;95%) for CTCs in peripheral blood, as well as the ability to release CTCs controllably and alive. Clinical tests substantiate the accurate differentiation between liver cancer, cirrhosis, and healthy groups using this method. The remarkable diagnostic accuracy (94%), lossless release of CTCs, material reversibility, and cost&#8208;effectiveness ($6.68 per sample) make the HH&#8208;based hydrogel a potentially revolutionary technology for liver cancer diagnosis and single&#8208;cell analysis.

         <title>Li Promoting Long Afterglow Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Transistor for Memory Optocoupler Module</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low power consumption long afterglow organic light&#8208;emitting transistors are fabricated to simultaneously accomplish the functions of in&#8208;memory calculation, light&#8208;emission, and decision&#8208;making process. When combined with optically switchable transistors and photodiode amplifiers, the biological neurotransmitter transfer and biological firing action after spiking excess threshold are mimicked in the chip.








Abstract
The artificial brain is conceived as advanced intelligence technology, capable to emulate in&#8208;memory processes occurring in the human brain by integrating synaptic devices. Within this context, improving the functionality of synaptic transistors to increase information processing density in neuromorphic chips is a major challenge in this field. In this article, Li&#8208;ion migration promoting long afterglow organic light&#8208;emitting transistors, which display exceptional postsynaptic brightness of 7000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 under low operational voltages of 10&#160;V is presented. The postsynaptic current of 0.1&#160;mA operating as a built&#8208;in threshold switch is implemented as a firing point in these devices. The setting&#8208;condition&#8208;triggered long afterglow is employed to drive the photoisomerization process of photochromic molecules that mimic neurotransmitter transfer in the human brain for realizing a key memory rule, that is, the transition from long&#8208;term memory to permanent memory. The combination of setting&#8208;condition&#8208;triggered long afterglow with photodiode amplifiers is also processed to emulate the human responding action after the setting&#8208;training process. Overall, the successful integration in neuromorphic computing comprising stimulus judgment, photon emission, transition, and encoding, &#160;to emulate the complicated decision tree of the human brain is demonstrated.

         <title>Highly Efficient and Stable Organic Photovoltaic Cells for Underwater Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An acceptor is designed and named ITO&#8208;4Cl and provides a comprehensive evaluation of its photovoltaic performance, stability, and pressure resistance when incorporated into organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells. Particularly, the OPV cells exhibit a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 25.6% at a depth of 1&#160;m underwater, confirming the promising prospects of OPV cells for underwater applications.








Abstract
Organic photovoltaic (OPV) technology holds tremendous promise as a sustainable power source for underwater off&#8208;grid systems. However, research on underwater OPV cells is relatively scarce. Here, this gap is addressed by focusing on the exploration and development of OPV cells specifically designed for underwater applications. An acceptor, named ITO&#8208;4Cl, with excellent water resistance, is rationally designed and synthesized. Benefiting from its low energetic disorder and an absorption spectrum well&#8208;suited to the underwater environment, the ITO&#8208;4Cl&#8208;based OPV cell achieves an unprecedented power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 25.6% at a water depth of 1&#160;m. Additionally, under 660&#160;nm laser irradiation, the cell demonstrates a notable PCE of 31.6%, indicating its potential for underwater wireless energy transfer. Due to the mitigation of thermal effects from solar irradiation, the lifetime of the ITO&#8208;4Cl&#8208;based OPV cell exceeds 7000&#160;h. Additionally, a flexible OPV cell is fabricated that maintains its initial PCE even under exposure to high pressures of 5&#160;MPa. A 32.5&#160;cm2 flexible module achieves an excellent PCE of 17%. This work fosters a deeper understanding of underwater OPV cells and highlights the promising prospects of OPV cells for underwater applications.

         <title>Immunogenic Material Vaccine for Cancer Immunotherapy by Structure&#8208;Dependent Immune Cell Trafficking and Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Immunogenic material vaccines offer enormous prospects in treating cancer. Here we&#160;report how the structure of materials containing immunopotentiator manganese impacts the dynamic coordination of innate and adaptive immune response. The outperformed rod&#8208;shaped hollow manganese material with an aspect ratio of 4.5 demonstrates the highest competence in immune cell modulation and cellular immunity against cancer in multiple aggressive tumor models.








Abstract
Inherently immunogenic materials offer enormous prospects in enhancing vaccine efficacy. However, the understanding and improving material adjuvanticity remain elusive. Herein how the structural presentation of immunopotentiators in a material governs the dynamic dialogue between innate and adaptive immunity for enhanced cancer vaccination is reported. The immunopotentiator manganese into six differing structures that resemble the architectures of two types of pathogens (spherical viruses or rod&#8208;like bacteria) is precisely manipulated. The results reveal that innate immune cells accurately sense and respond to the architectures, of which two outperformed material candidates (151&#160;nm hollow spheres and hollow microrods with an aspect ratio of 4.5) show higher competence in creating local proinflammatory environment with promoted innate immune cell influx and stimulation on dendritic cells (DCs). In combination with viral peptides, model proteins, or cell lysate antigens, the outperformed microrod material remarkably primes antigen&#8208;specific CD8 cytolytic T cells. In prophylactic and therapeutic regimens, the microrod adjuvanted vaccines display optimal aptitude in tumor suppression in four aggressive murine tumor models, by promoting the infiltration of heterogeneous cytolytic effector cells while decreasing suppressive immunoregulatory populations in tumors. This study demonstrates that a rationally selected architecture of immunogenic materials potentially advances the clinical reality of cancer vaccination.

         <title>Chlorination Design for Highly Stable Electrolyte toward High Mass Loading and Long Cycle Life Sodium&#8208;Based Dual&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chlorination design strategy is proposed for sodium&#8208;based dual ion batteries, and as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the chlorinated electrolyte based on chloromethyl ethyl carbonate displays notably enhanced oxidative stability and highly reversible anion intercalation into the graphite cathode; meanwhile, the uniform and efficient plating/stripping of Na+ ions on the anode is also achieved.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;based dual ion batteries (SDIBs) have garnered significant attention as novel energy storage devices offering the advantages of high&#8208;voltage and low&#8208;cost. Nonetheless, conventional electrolytes exhibit low resistance to oxidation and poor compatibility with electrode materials, resulting in rapid battery failure. In this study, for the first time, a chlorination design of electrolytes for SDIB, is proposed. Using ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC) as a representative, chlorine (Cl)&#8208;substituted EMC not only demonstrates increased oxidative stability ascribed to the electron&#8208;withdrawing characteristics of chlorine atom, electrolyte compatibility with both the cathode and anode is also greatly improved by forming Cl&#8208;containing interface layers. Consequently, a discharge capacity of 104.6 mAh g&#8722;1 within a voltage range of 3.0&#8211;5.0&#160;V is achieved for Na||graphite SDIB that employs a high graphite cathode mass loading of 5.0&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, along with almost no capacity decay after 900 cycles. Notably, the Na||graphite SDIB can be revived for an additional 900 cycles through the replacement of a fresh Na anode. As the mass loading of graphite cathode increased to 10&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, Na||graphite SDIB is still capable of sustaining over 700 times with &#8776;100% capacity retention. These results mark the best outcome among reported SDIBs. This study corroborates the effectiveness of chlorination design in developing high&#8208;voltage electrolytes and attaining enduring cycle stability of Na&#8208;based energy storage devices.

Bimetallic PdCu mesoporous nanocavities (MCs) are reported as an enzymatic bifunctional electrocatalyst for concurrent electrosynthesis of value&#8208;added NH3 and glycolic acid from waste pollutants (NO3&#8722; and polyethylene&#8208;terephthalate&#8208;derived alcohol). Thanks to structural synergies, the performance of PdCu MC nanozymes outperforms the most of the&#8208;state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts.








Abstract
Electrochemical upcycling of waste pollutants into high value&#8208;added fuels and/or chemicals is recognized as a green and sustainable solution that can address the resource utilization on earth. Despite great efforts, their progress has seriously been hindered by the lack of high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts. In this work, bimetallic PdCu mesoporous nanocavities (MCs) are reported as a new bifunctional enzymatic electrocatalyst that realizes concurrent electrocatalytic upcycling of nitrate wastewater and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic waste. Abundant metal mesopores and open nanocavities of PdCu MCs provide the enzymatic confinement of key intermediates for the deeper electroreduction of nitrate and accelerate the transport of reactants/products within/out of electrocatalyst, thus affording high ammonia Faradic efficiency (FENH3) of 96.6% and yield rate of 5.6&#160;mg&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;mg&#8722;1 at the cathode. Meanwhile, PdCu MC nanozymes trigger the selective electrooxidation of PET&#8208;derived ethylene glycol (EG) into glycolic acid (GA) and formic acid with high FEs of &gt;90% by a facile regulation of potentials at the anode. Moreover, concurrent electrosynthesis of value&#8208;added NH3 and GA is disclosed in the two&#8208;electrode coupling system, further confirming the high efficiency of bifunctional PdCu MC nanozymes in producing value&#8208;added fuels and chemicals from waste pollutants in a sustainable manner.

         <title>Noncontact Microfluidics of Highly Viscous Liquids for Accurate Self&#8208;Splitting and Pipetting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
On the highly transparent PS platform, the liquids with viscosity as high as 15&#160;000&#160;mPa s (epoxy) can be noncontact split with the assistance of sunlight and a cooling source. Compared with commercial pipettes or droppers (&#8776;1.3% accuracy for pipetting polymer liquids), this accurate PS platform (&gt;83.5%) shows great potential in the quantification of highly viscous liquids.








Abstract
Accurate dosing for various liquids, especially for highly viscous liquids, is fundamental in wide&#8208;ranging from molecular crosslinking to material processing. Despite droppers or pipettes being widely used as pipetting devices, they are powerless for quantificationally splitting and dosing highly viscous liquids (&gt;100&#160;mPa s) like polymer liquids due to the intertwined macromolecular chains and strong cohesion energy. Here, a highly transparent photopyroelectric slippery (PS) platform is provided to achieve noncontact self&#8208;splitting for liquids with viscosity as high as 15&#160;000&#160;mPa s, just with the assistance of sunlight and a cooling source to provide a local temperature difference (&#916;T). Moreover, to guarantee the accuracy for pipetting liquids (&gt;80%), the ultrathin MXene film (within a thickness of 20&#160;nm) is self&#8208;assembled as the photo&#8208;thermal layers, overcoming the trade&#8208;off between transparency and photothermal property. Compared with traditional pipetting strategies (&#8776;1.3% accuracy for pipetting polymer liquids), this accurate microfluidic chip shows great potential in adhesive systems (bonding strength, twice than using the droppers or pipettes).

         <title>Anchored Cobalt Nanoparticles on Layered Perovskites for Rapid Peroxymonosulfate Activation in Antibiotic Degradation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy for perovskite oxide catalysts is proposed to address two limiting factors in the development of advanced oxidation process (AOPs): the activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) and the cycling stability of metal catalysts. The comprehensive performance of the catalysts is tested to highlight the technical potential of the PMS heterogeneous reaction&#8208;activated in situ exsolved strategy.








Abstract
In the Fenton&#8208;like reaction, revealing the dynamic evolution of the active sites is crucial to achieve the activity improvement and stability of the catalyst. This study reports a perovskite oxide in which atomic (Co0) in situ embedded exsolution occurs during the high&#8208;temperature phase transition. This unique anchoring strategy significantly improves the Co3+/Co2+ cycling efficiency at the interface and inhibits metal leaching during peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation. The Co@L&#8208;PBMC catalyst exhibits superior PMS activation ability and could achieve 99% degradation of tetracycline within 5&#160;min. The combination of experimental characterization and density functional theory (DFT) calculations elucidates that the electron&#8208;deficient oxygen vacancy accepts an electron from the Co 3d&#8208;orbital, resulting in a significant electron delocalization of the Co site, thereby facilitating the adsorption of the *HSO5/*OH intermediate onto the &#8220;metal&#8208;VO bridge&#8221; structure. This work provides insights into the PMS activation mechanism at the atomic level, which will guide the rational design of next&#8208;generation catalysts for environmental remediation.

         <title>Sulfur&#8208;Tuned Main&#8208;Group Sb&#8722;N&#8722;C Catalysts for Selective 2&#8208;Electron and 4&#8208;Electron Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of main&#8208;group Sb&#8722;N&#8722;C single&#8208;atom catalysts are developed with varied oxidation states of the Sb sites via changing the contents of sulfur dopants, resulting in tunable ORR selectivity toward either the 4&#8208;electron or 2&#8208;electron pathway.








Abstract
The selective oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is important for various energy conversion processes such as the fuel cells and metal&#8208;air batteries for the 4e&#8722; pathway and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) electrosynthesis for the 2e&#8722; pathway. However, it remains a challenge to tune the ORR selectivity of a catalyst in a controllable manner. Herein, an efficient strategy for introducing sulfur dopants to regulate the ORR selectivity of main&#8208;group Sb&#8722;N&#8722;C single&#8208;atom catalysts&#160; is reported. Significantly, Sb&#8722;N&#8722;C with the highest sulfur content follows a 2e&#8722; pathway with high H2O2 selectivity (96.8%) and remarkable mass activity (96.1 A g&#8722;1 at 0.65&#160;V), while the sister catalyst with the lowest sulfur content directs a 4e&#8722; pathway with a half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2 = 0.89&#160;V) that is more positive than commercial Pt/C. In addition, practical applications for these two 2e&#8722;/4e&#8722; ORR catalysts are demonstrated by bulk H2O2 electrosynthesis for the degradation of organic pollutants and a high&#8208;power zinc&#8208;air battery, respectively. Combined experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the excellent selectivity for the sulfurized Sb&#8722;N&#8722;Cs is attributed to the optimal adsorption&#8208;desorption of the ORR intermediates realized through the electronic structure modulation by the sulfur dopants.

         <title>Thermal Welding of Liquids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deep understanding of the assembly behavior of nanoparticle surfactants (NPSs) that are generated in situ at the oil&#8211;water interface through host&#8211;guest interactions is presented. Taking advantage of the temperature responsiveness of NPSs, thermal&#8208;controlled cargo release and welding of liquids can be achieved, opening a pathway to the construction of modular all&#8208;liquid fluidics.








Abstract
Welding of thermoplastics is a common practice in many industrial sectors, but it has yet to be realized with fluids. Here, the thermal welding of liquids by using the assembly and jamming of nanoparticle surfactants (NPSs) at liquid&#8211;liquid interfaces is reported. By fine&#8208;tuning the dynamic interaction strength within NPSs, the interfacial activity of NPSs, as well as the binding energy of NPSs to the interface can be precisely controlled, leading to a dynamic exchange of NPSs, maximizing the reduction in the interfacial energy. With NPSs jammed at the interface, the structures of liquids can be manipulated to complex geometries by applying an external force and, due to the temperature responsiveness of NPSs, when bringing liquids into contact and heating the system, welding of liquids can be achieved. This work provides a straightforward strategy for the construction of modular all&#8208;liquid fluidics, opening up numerous opportunities in fields like biotechnology, healthcare, and materials science.

Taking advantage of the temperature responsiveness of NPSs, thermal-controlled cargo release and welding of liquids can be achieved, opening a pathway to the construction of modular all-liquid fluidics.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welding of thermoplastics is a common practice in many industrial sectors, but it has yet to be realized with fluids. Here, the thermal welding of liquids by using the assembly and jamming of nanoparticle surfactants (NPSs) at liquid&#8211;liquid interfaces is reported. By fine-tuning the dynamic interaction strength within NPSs, the interfacial activity of NPSs, as well as the binding energy of NPSs to the interface can be precisely controlled, leading to a dynamic exchange of NPSs, maximizing the reduction in the interfacial energy. With NPSs jammed at the interface, the structures of liquids can be manipulated to complex geometries by applying an external force and, due to the temperature responsiveness of NPSs, when bringing liquids into contact and heating the system, welding of liquids can be achieved. This work provides a straightforward strategy for the construction of modular all-liquid fluidics, opening up numerous opportunities in fields like biotechnology, healthcare, and materials science.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Universal Design Strategy for Air&#8208;Stable Layered Na&#8208;Ion Cathodes toward Sustainable Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The carbon footprint of Na&#8208;ion batteries is significantly increased due to the air stability issue of layered cathodes. In this paper, the air degradation origins and mechanisms of O3 cathodes are investigated via combined first&#8208;principles and experimental approaches, and a universal design strategy is proposed for the rational design of air&#8208;stable Na&#8208;ion cathodes toward both elemental and manufactural sustainability.








Abstract
Na&#8208;ion batteries (NIBs) are sustainable alternatives to Li&#8208;ion technologies due to the abundant and widely&#8208;distributed resources. However, the most promising cathode materials of NIBs so far, O3 layered oxides, suffer from serious air instability issues, which significantly increases the manufactural cost and carbon footprint because of the long&#8208;term use of dry rooms. While some feasible strategies are proposed via case studies, universal design strategies for air&#8208;stable cathodes are yet to be established. Herein, the air degradation mechanisms of O3 cathodes are investigated via combined first&#8208;principles and experimental approaches, with bond dissociation energy proposed as an effective descriptor for predicting air stability. Experimental validations in various unary, binary, and ternary O3 cathodes confirm that the air stability can indeed be effectively improved via simple compositional design. Guided by the predictive model, the designed material can sustain 30&#8208;day air&#8208;storage without structural or electrochemical degradation. It is calculated that such air&#8208;stable cathodes can significantly reduce both energy consumption (&#8776;4&#8201;100&#8201;000&#160;kWh) and carbon footprint (&#8776;2200&#8208;ton CO2) annually for a 2 GWh NIBs manufactory. Therefore, the fundamental understandings and universal design strategy presented open an avenue for rational materials design of NIBs toward both elemental and manufactural sustainability.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Antisymmetric Magnetoresistance in van der Waals Ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;quality room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetic material Fe3GaTe2 is synthesized by the chemical vapor transport method. An unconventional room&#8208;temperature antisymmetric magnetoresistance is observed in 2D Fe3GaTe2 devices with the planar symmetry breaking. This work provides new routes to achieve magnetic random storage and logic devices by utilizing the room&#8208;temperature thickness&#8208;controlled antisymmetric magnetoresistance.








Abstract
Van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnetic materials have emerged as a promising platform for the development of 2D spintronic devices. However, studies to date are restricted to vdW ferromagnetic materials with low Curie temperature (Tc) and small magnetic anisotropy. Here, a chemical vapor transport method is developed to synthesize a high&#8208;quality room&#8208;temperature ferromagnet, Fe3GaTe2 (c&#8208;Fe3GaTe2), which boasts a high Tc = 356 K and large perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Due to the planar symmetry breaking, an unconventional room&#8208;temperature antisymmetric magnetoresistance (MR) is first observed in c&#8208;Fe3GaTe2 devices with step features, manifesting as three distinctive states of high, intermediate, and low resistance with the sweeping magnetic field. Moreover, the modulation of the antisymmetric MR is demonstrated by controlling the height of the surface steps. This work provides new routes to achieve magnetic random storage and logic devices by utilizing the room&#8208;temperature thickness&#8208;controlled antisymmetric MR and further design room&#8208;temperature 2D spintronic devices based on the vdW ferromagnet c&#8208;Fe3GaTe2.

         <title>Harvesting Multicolor Photoluminescence in Nonaromatic Interpenetrated Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanocrystals via Pressure&#8208;Modulated Carbonyls Aggregation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonaromatic interpenetrated Zn4O(ADC)4(Et3N)6 IRMOF&#8208;0 nanocrystals (NCs)&#160;show a photoluminescence&#160;turn&#8208;on behavior via pressure&#8208;induced aggregation effect, where aggregation of carbonyls&#160;results in O&#9472;O distances smaller than the sum of the van der Waals radii (3.04 &#197;). IRMOF&#8208;0 NCs exhibit an ultrabroad emission tunability, which mainly arises from the retention at varying degrees of through&#8208;space n&#8211;&#960;* interactions achieved by pressure&#8208;treated engineering.








Abstract
Interpenetrated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with nonaromatic ligands provide a unique platform for adsorption, catalysis, and sensing applications. However, nonemission and the lack of optical property tailoring make it challenging to fabricate smart responsive devices with nonaromatic interpenetrated MOFs based on ligand&#8208;centered emission. In this paper, the pressure&#8208;induced aggregation effect is introduced in nonaromatic interpenetrated Zn4O(ADC)4(Et3N)6 (IRMOF&#8208;0) nanocrystals (NCs), where carbonyl groups aggregation results in O&#9472;O distances smaller than the sum of the van der Waals radii (3.04 &#197;), triggering the photoluminescence turn&#8208;on behavior. It is noteworthy that the IRMOF&#8208;0 NCs display an ultrabroad emission tunability of 130&#160;nm from deep blue (440&#160;nm) to yellow (570&#160;nm) upon release to ambient conditions at different pressures. The eventual retention of through&#8208;space n&#8211;&#960;* interactions in different degrees via pressure treatment is primarily responsible for achieving a controllable multicolor emission behavior in initially nonemissive IRMOF&#8208;0 NCs. The fabricated multicolor phosphor&#8208;converted light&#8208;emitting diodes based on the pressure&#8208;treated IRMOF&#8208;0 NCs exhibit excellent thermal, chromaticity, and fatigue stability. The proposed strategy not only imparts new vitality to nonaromatic interpenetrated MOFs but also offers new perspectives for advancements in the field of multicolor displays and daylight illumination.

         <title>Influence of Li Content on the Topological Inhibition of Oxygen Loss in Li&#8208;Rich Cathode Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In Li&#8208;rich layered oxide cathodes, the formation of a migration network of redox&#8208;active oxygen ions can be prevented when the transition metal ions occupy over 5/6 of the sites in the transition metal layer, and thereby, the oxidized oxygen species can be encaged in the lattice, leading to topological inhibition of oxygen loss during cycling.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;rich layer oxide cathodes are promising energy storage materials due to their high energy densities. However, the oxygen loss during cycling limits their practical applications. Here, the essential role of Li content on the topological inhibition of oxygen loss in lithium&#8208;rich cathode materials and the relationship between the migration network of oxygen ions and the transition metal (TM) component are revealed. Utilizing first&#8208;principles calculations in combination with percolation theory and Monte Carlo simulations, it is found that TM ions can effectively encage the oxidized oxygen species when the TM concentration in TM layer exceeds 5/6, which hinders the formation of a percolating oxygen migration network. This study demonstrates the significance of rational compositional design in lithium&#8208;rich cathodes for effectively suppressing irreversible oxygen release and enhancing cathode cycling performance.

         <title>Boosting Contact Electrification by Amorphous Polyvinyl Alcohol Endowing Improved Contact Adhesion and Electrochemical Capacitance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stronger binding to water molecules, and the consequent higher water uptake, is shown to be responsible for the improved electrical output of triboelectric generators and sensors based on an amorphous polyvinyl alcohol compared to the more common homopolymer derivative. The specific role played by the increased material softness, adhesive contact, and ionic conductivity on devices performance is highlighted.








Abstract
Ion conductive hydrogels are relevant components in wearable, biocompatible, and biodegradable electronics. Polyvinyl&#8208;alcohol (PVA) homopolymer is often the favored choice for integration into supercapacitors and energy harvesters as in sustainable triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). However, to further improve hydrogel&#8208;based TENGs, a deeper understanding of the impact of their composition and structure on devices performance is necessary. Here, it is shown how ionic hydrogels based on an amorphous&#8208;PVA (a&#8208;PVA) allow to fabricate TENGs that outperform the one based on the homopolymer. When used as tribomaterial, the Li&#8208;doped a&#8208;PVA allows to achieve a twofold higher pressure sensitivity compared to PVA, and to develop a conformable e&#8208;skin. When used as an ionic conductor encased in an elastomeric tribomaterial, 100&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 average power is obtained, providing 25% power increase compared to PVA. At the origin of such enhancement is the increased softness, stronger adhesive contact, higher ionic mobility (&gt; 3,5&#8208;fold increase), and long&#8208;term stability achieved with Li&#8208;doped a&#8208;PVA. These improvements are attributed to the high density of hydroxyl groups and amorphous structure present in the a&#8208;PVA, enabling&#160;a strong binding to water molecules. This work discloses novel insights on those&#160;parameters allowing to&#160;develop&#160;easy&#8208;processable,&#160;stable, and highly conductive hydrogels for integration in conformable, soft, and biocompatible TENGs.

&lt;p&gt;Ion conductive hydrogels are relevant components in wearable, biocompatible, and biodegradable electronics. Polyvinyl-alcohol (PVA) homopolymer is often the favored choice for integration into supercapacitors and energy harvesters as in sustainable triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). However, to further improve hydrogel-based TENGs, a deeper understanding of the impact of their composition and structure on devices performance is necessary. Here, it is shown how ionic hydrogels based on an amorphous-PVA (a-PVA) allow to fabricate TENGs that outperform the one based on the homopolymer. When used as tribomaterial, the Li-doped a-PVA allows to achieve a twofold higher pressure sensitivity compared to PVA, and to develop a conformable e-skin. When used as an ionic conductor encased in an elastomeric tribomaterial, 100&#160;mW cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; average power is obtained, providing 25% power increase compared to PVA.

         <title>Ultimately Adaptive Fluid Interfacial Phospholipid Membranes Unveiled Unanticipated High Cellular Mechanical Work</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ideally adaptive cellular scaffold is developed by decorating a fluid interface with phospholipid membranes. In contrast to conventional solid or hydrogel scaffolds, cell adhesion behaviors thereon follow an adaptive wetting regime with surprisingly high mechanical work, which highlights an analogy of cell adhesion behaviors and droplet wetting on surfaces with a low Young's modulus.








Abstract
Living cells actively interact biochemically and mechanically with the surrounding extracellular matrices (ECMs) and undergo dramatic morphological and dimensional transitions, concomitantly remodeling ECMs. However, there is no suitable method to quantitatively discuss the contribution of mechanical interactions in such mutually adaptive processes. Herein, a highly deformable &#8220;living&#8221; cellular scaffold is developed to evaluate overall mechanical energy transfer between cell and ECMs. It is based on the water&#8211;perfluorocarbon interface decorated with phospholipids bearing a cell&#8208;adhesive ligand and fluorescent tag. The bioinert nature of the phospholipid membranes prevents the formation of solid&#8208;like protein nanofilms at the fluid interface, enabling to visualize and quantify cellular mechanical work against the ultimately adaptive model ECM. A new cellular wetting regime is identified, wherein interface deformation proceeds to cell flattening, followed by its eventual restoration. The cellular mechanical work during this adaptive wetting process is one order of magnitude higher than those reported with&#160;conventional elastic platforms. The behavior of viscous liquid drops at the air&#8211;water interface can simulate cellular adaptive wetting, suggesting that overall viscoelasticity of the cell body predominates the emergent wetting regime and regulates mechanical output. Cellular&#8208;force&#8208;driven high&#8208;energy states on the adaptive platform can be useful for cell fate manipulation.

         <title>Durable Perovskite Solar Cells with 24.5% Average Efficiency: The Role of Rigid Conjugated Core in Molecular Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dibenzo[g,p]chrysene, a non&#8208;planar double helicene, displays enhanced rigidity compared to tetraphenylethene, enabling the development of a molecular semiconductor with elevated cohesive energy density and hole mobility. Applied in high&#8208;efficiency perovskite solar cell fabrication, it exhibits remarkable operational stability at 45&#160;&#176;C and storage stability at 85&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Efficient and robust n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite solar cells necessitate superior organic hole&#8208;transport materials with both mechanical and electronic prowess. Deciphering the structure&#8211;property relationship of these materials is crucial for practical perovskite solar cell applications. Through direct arylation, two high glass transition temperature molecular semiconductors, DBC&#8208;ETPA (202&#160;&#176;C) and TPE&#8208;ETPA (180&#160;&#176;C) are synthesized, using dibenzo[g,p]chrysene (DBC) and 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetraphenylethene (TPE) tetrabromides with triphenylene&#8211;ethylenedioxythiophene&#8208;dimethoxytriphenylamine (ETPA). In comparison to spiro&#8208;OMeTAD, both semiconductors exhibit shallower HOMO energy levels, resulting in increased hole densities (generated by air oxidation doping) and accelerated hole extraction from photoexcited perovskite. Experimental and theoretical studies highlight the more rigid DBC core, enhancing hole mobility due to reduced reorganization energy and lower energy disorder. Importantly, DBC&#8208;ETPA possesses a higher cohesive energy density, leading to lower ion diffusion coefficients and higher Young's moduli. Leveraging these attributes, DBC&#8208;ETPA is employed as the primary hole&#8208;transport layer component, yielding perovskite solar cells with an average efficiency of 24.5%, surpassing spiro&#8208;OMeTAD reference cells (24.0%). Furthermore, DBC&#8208;ETPA&#8208;based cells exhibit superior operational stability and 85&#160;&#176;C thermal storage stability.

         <title>A Glucose&#8208;Responsive Cannula for Automated and Electronics&#8208;Free Insulin Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, a glucose&#8208;responsive cannula is presented for automated insulin delivery without the use of electronics. This cannula, composed of a resilient elastomer&#8208;hydrogel hybrid, changes its permeability in response to glucose levels. Tested in diabetic mice, it effectively maintains blood glucose levels within target ranges for &#8776;3&#160;d, offering a potential solution for user&#8208;centric insulin delivery.








Abstract
Automated delivery of insulin based on continuous glucose monitoring is revolutionizing the way insulin&#8208;dependent diabetes is treated. However, challenges remain for the widespread adoption of these systems, including the requirement of a separate glucose sensor, sophisticated electronics and algorithms, and the need for significant user input to operate these costly therapies. Herein, a user&#8208;centric glucose&#8208;responsive cannula is reported for electronics&#8208;free insulin delivery. The cannula&#8212;made from a tough, elastomer&#8208;hydrogel hybrid membrane formed through a one&#8208;pot solvent exchange method&#8212;changes permeability to release insulin rapidly upon physiologically relevant varying glucose levels, providing simple and automated insulin delivery with no additional hardware or software. Two prototypes of the cannula are evaluated in insulin&#8208;deficient diabetic mice. The first cannula&#8212;an ends&#8208;sealed, subcutaneously inserted prototype&#8212;normalizes blood glucose levels for 3&#160;d and controls postprandial glucose levels. The second, more translational version&#8212;a cannula with the distal end sealed and the proximal end connected to a transcutaneous injection port&#8212;likewise demonstrates tight, 3&#8208;d regulation of blood glucose levels when refilled twice daily. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study may aid in the development of &#8220;smart&#8221; cannulas and next&#8208;generation insulin therapies at a reduced burden&#8208;of&#8208;care toll and cost to end&#8208;users.

         <title>Boosting Formate Electrooxidation by Heterostructured PtPd Alloy and Oxides Nanowires</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterostructured platinum&#8208;palladium alloy and oxides nanowires (PtPd&#8208;ox NWs) with abundant heterojunction interfaces and defect sites are synthesized through a facile self&#8208;template method. PtPd&#8208;ox NWs with optimal electronic structure achieve dual regulation via both regulating key intermediate adsorption behavior and coupling key reaction processes, demonstrating remarkable performance toward formate electrooxidation reaction.








Abstract
Direct formate fuel cells (DFFCs) receive increasing attention as promising technologies for the future energy mix and environmental sustainability, as formate can be made from carbon dioxide utilization and is carbon neutral. Herein, heterostructured platinum&#8208;palladium&#160;alloy and oxides nanowires (PtPd&#8208;ox NWs) with abundant defect sites are synthesized through a facile self&#8208;template method and demonstrated high activity toward formate electrooxidation reaction (FOR). The electronic tuning arising from the heterojunction between alloy and oxides influence the work function of PtPd&#8208;ox NWs. The sample with optimal work function reveals the favorable adsorption behavior for intermediates and strong interaction in the d&#8722;p orbital hybridization between Pt site and oxygen in formate, favoring the FOR direct pathway with a low energy barrier. Besides the thermodynamic regulation, the heterostructure can also provide sufficient hydroxyl species to facilitate the formation of carbon dioxide due to the ability of combining absorbed hydrogen and carbon monoxide at adjacent active sites, which contributes to the improvement of FOR kinetics on PtPd&#8208;ox NWs. Thus, heterostructured PtPd&#8208;ox NWs achieve dual regulation of FOR thermodynamics and kinetics, exhibiting remarkable performance and demonstrating potential in practical systems.

         <title>Sub&#8208;Nanometer Mono&#8208;Layered Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Nanosheets for Simulated Flue Gas Photoreduction</title>

A kind of sub&#8208;nanometer mono&#8208;layered nanosheets (Co&#8208;MOF MNSs) is successfully prepared with remarkable performance in selective CO2 photo&#8208;reduction into formic acid under simulated flue gas.








Abstract
The dilemma between the thickness and accessible active site triggers the design of porous crystalline materials with mono&#8208;layered structure for advanced photo&#8208;catalysis applications. Here, a kind of sub&#8208;nanometer mono&#8208;layered nanosheets (Co&#8208;MOF MNSs) through the exfoliation of specifically designed Co3 cluster&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is reported. The sub&#8208;nanometer thickness and inherent light&#8208;sensitivity endow Co&#8208;MOF MNSs with fully exposed Janus Co3 sites that can selectively photo&#8208;reduce CO2 into formic acid under simulated flue gas. Notably, the production efficiency of formic acid by Co&#8208;MOF MNSs (0.85&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1) is &#8776;13 times higher than that of the bulk counterpart (0.065&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1) under a simulated flue gas atmosphere, which is the highest in reported works up to date. Theoretical calculations prove that the exposed Janus Co3 sites with simultaneously available sites possess higher activity when compared with single Co site, validating the importance of mono&#8208;layered nanosheet morphology. These results may facilitate the development of functional nanosheet materials for CO2 photo&#8208;reduction in potential flue gas treatment.

         <title>Ultrathin High&#8208;Entropy Fe&#8208;Based Spinel Oxide Nanosheets with Metalloid Band Structures for Efficient Nitrate Reduction toward Ammonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modified sol&#8211;gel method has developed to synthesize ultrathin high&#8208;entropy Fe&#8208;based spinel oxide (denotes A5Fe2O4) nanosheets. Theoretic and experimental results confirm that the high&#8208;Entropy A5Fe2O4 nanosheets have metalloid band structures with remarkedly enhanced performance for the electrochemical nitrate reduction toward ammonia.








Abstract
Spinel oxides with tunable chemical compositions have emerged as versatile electrocatalysts, however their performance is greatly limited by small surface area and low electron conductivity. Here, ultrathin high&#8208;entropy Fe&#8208;based spinel oxides nanosheets are rationally designed (i.e., (Co0.2Ni0.2Zn0.2Mg0.2Cu0.2)Fe2O4; denotes A5Fe2O4) in thickness of &#8776;4.3&#160;nm with large surface area and highly exposed active sites via a modified sol&#8211;gel method. Theoretic and experimental results confirm that the bandgap of A5Fe2O4 nanosheets is significantly smaller than that of ordinary Fe&#8208;based spinel oxides, realizing the transformation of binary spinel oxide from semiconductors to metalloids. As a result, such A5Fe2O4 nanosheets manifest excellent performance for the nitrate reduction reaction (NO3&#8722;RR) to ammonia (NH3), with a NH3 yield rate of &#8776;2.1&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.5&#160;V versus Reversible hydrogen electrode, outperforming other spinel&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Systematic mechanism investigations reveal that the NO3&#8722;RR is mainly occurred on Fe sites, and introducing high&#8208;entropy compositions in tetrahedral sites regulates the adsorption strength of N and O&#8208;related intermediates on Fe for boosting the NO3&#8722;RR. The above findings offer a high&#8208;entropy platform to regulate the bandgap and enhance the electrocatalytic performance of spinel oxides.

         <title>Unraveling Paradoxical Effects of Large Current Density on Zn Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The paradox between oriented Zn deposition and poor cell lifetime during large current operation is revealed to be relevant with the multiplied current density in the separator channels. Furthermore, this phenomenon is described as the separator permeation effect, which explains the rapid short circuit despite smooth Zn deposition.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;based batteries (ZBs) have been widely investigated owing to their intrinsic safety, low cost, and simple assembly. However, the actual behavior of Zn deposition under large current density is still a severe issue associated with obscure mechanism interpretation of ZBs under high loading. Here, differing from the conventional understanding that short circuit is induced by dendrite penetrating under large current density (10&#8211;100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2), the separator permeation effect is unraveled to illustrate the paradox between smooth deposition and short lifespan. Generally, a dense plating morphology is achieved under large current density because of intensive nuclei and boosted plane growth. Nevertheless, in the scenes applying separators, the multiplied local current density derived from narrow separator channels leads to rapid Zn2+ exhaustion, converting the Zn deposition mode from nucleation control to concentration control, which eventually results in separator permeation and short circuit. This effect is validated in other aqueous metal anodes (Cu, Sn, Fe) and receives similar results. Based on the understanding, a micro&#8208;pore (150&#160;&#181;m) sponge foam is proposed as separators for large&#8208;current anodes to provide broader Zn2+ path and mitigate the separator permeation effect. This work provides unique perspectives on coordinating fast&#8208;charging ability and anode stability of ZBs.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>

An advanced reverse atom capture technique is developed to capture surface segregated Ba and Sr cations from PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+&#948; (PBSCF) perovskite, resulting in a unique (Ba/Sr)(Co/Fe/W)O3&#8722;&#948; (BSCFW)@PBSCF heterostructured cathode for protonic ceramic fuel cells. The single cell using such heterostructured cathode delivers an excellent peak power density of 1.32&#160;W cm&#8722;2 at 650&#160;&#176;C and a robust durability for 240&#160;h.








Abstract
Protonic ceramic fuel cells (PCFCs) hold potential for sustainable energy conversion, yet their widespread application is hindered by the sluggish kinetics and inferior stability of cathode materials. Here, a facile and efficient reverse atom capture technique is developed to manipulate the surface chemistry of PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+&#948; (PBSCF) cathode for PCFCs. This method successfully captures segregated Ba and Sr cations on the PBSCF surface using W species, creating a (Ba/Sr)(Co/Fe/W)O3&#8722;&#948; (BSCFW)@PBSCF heterostructure. Benefiting from enhanced kinetics of proton&#8208;involved oxygen reduction reaction and strengthened chemical stability, the single cell using the optimized 2W&#8208;PBSCF cathode demonstrates an exceptional peak power density of 1.32&#160;W cm&#8722;2 at 650&#160;&#176;C and maintains durable performance for 240&#160;h. Theoretical calculations unveil that the BSCFW perovskite delivers lower oxygen vacancy formation energy, hydration energy, and proton transfer energy compared to the PBSCF perovskite. This protocol offers new insights into advanced atom capture techniques for sustainable energy infrastructures.

         <title>Lignin Derived Ultrathin All&#8208;Solid Polymer Electrolytes with 3D Single&#8208;Ion Nanofiber Ionic Bridge Framework for High Performance Lithium Batteries</title>

Lignin derived ultrathin all&#8208;solid composite polymer electrolytes, which possess 3D nanofiber ionic bridge networks composed of single&#8208;ion lignin&#8208;based lithium salt&#160;and poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene)&#160;as the framework, and poly(ethylene oxide)/lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide&#160;as the filler, is obtained through spinning/spraying and hot&#8208;pressing. It can be applied in dendrite&#8208;resistant and low&#8208;temperature lithium batteries.








Abstract
The lignin derived ultrathin all&#8208;solid composite polymer electrolyte (CPE) with a thickness of only 13.2&#160;&#181;m, which possess 3D nanofiber ionic bridge networks composed of single&#8208;ion lignin&#8208;based lithium salt (L&#8208;Li) and poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF&#8208;HFP) as the framework, and poly(ethylene oxide)/lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (PEO/LiTFSI) as the filler, is obtained through electrospinning/spraying and hot&#8208;pressing. t. The Li&#8208;symmetric cell assembled with the CPE can stably cycle more than 6000&#160;h under 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with little Li dendrites growth. Moreover, the assembled Li||CPE||LiFePO4 cells can stably cycle over 700 cycles at 0.2 C with a super high initial discharge capacity of 158.5 mAh g&#8722;1 at room temperature, and a favorable capacity of 123 mAh g&#8722;1 at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C for 250 cycles. The excellent electrochemical performance is mainly attributed to the reason that the nanofiber ionic bridge network can afford uniformly dispersed single&#8208;ion L&#8208;Li through electrospinning, which synergizes with the LiTFSI well dispersed in PEO to form abundant and efficient 3D Li+ transfer channels. The ultrathin CPE induces uniform deposition of Li+ at the interface, and effectively inhibit the lithium dendrites. This work provides a promising strategy to achieve ultrathin biobased electrolytes for solid&#8208;state lithium ion batteries.

         <title>In Situ Polymerization Facilitating Practical High&#8208;Safety Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining the high&#8208;safety liquid electrolyte with in situ polymerization, the safety of quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries is significantly enhanced. The in&#8208;depth investigation demonstrates that the thermally stable polymer skeleton covering the electrodes impedes various exothermic reactions at elevated temperatures, promoting the self&#8208;heating temperature (T1) and onset temperature (T2), and reducing the temperature rise rate (dT dt&#8722;1) during battery thermal runaway process.








Abstract
Quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (QSSBs) are gaining widespread attention as a promising solution to improve battery safety performance. However, the safety improvement and the underlying mechanisms of QSSBs remain elusive. Herein, a novel strategy combining high&#8208;safety ethylene carbonate&#8208;free liquid electrolyte and in situ polymerization technique is proposed to prepare practical QSSBs. The Ah&#8208;level QSSBs with LiNi0.83Co0.11Mn0.06O2 cathode and graphite&#8211;silicon anode demonstrate significantly improved safety features without sacrificing electrochemical performance. As evidenced by accelerating rate calorimetry tests, the QSSBs exhibit increased self&#8208;heating temperature and onset temperature (T2), and decreased temperature rise rate during thermal runaway (TR). The T2 has a maximum increase of 48.4&#160;&#176;C compared to the conventional liquid batteries. Moreover, the QSSBs do not undergo TR until 180&#160;&#176;C (even 200&#160;&#176;C) during the hot&#8208;box tests, presenting significant improvement compared to the liquid batteries that run into TR at 130&#160;&#176;C. Systematic investigations show that the in situ formed polymer skeleton effectively mitigates the exothermic reactions between lithium salts and lithiated anode, retards the oxygen release from cathode, and inhibits crosstalk reactions between cathode and anode at elevated temperatures. The findings offer an innovative solution for practical high&#8208;safety QSSBs and open up a new sight for building safer high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries.

         <title>Super&#8208;Ionic Conductor Soft Filler Promotes Li+ Transport in Integrated Cathode&#8211;Electrolyte for Solid&#8208;State Battery at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on dipole interaction between super&#8208;ionic conductive soft filler (Li+ conductivity nanocellulose, Li&#8208;NC) and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), a tough dual&#8208;channel Li+ transport electrolyte (TDCT) is constructed. The anchoring effect of Li&#8208;NC prevents local concentration polarization in TDCT. An integrated electrode design effectively enhances the Li+ transport at the cathode&#8211;electrolyte interface.








Abstract
Composite polymer solid electrolytes (CPEs), possessing good rigid flexible, are expected to be used in solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries. The integration of fillers into polymer matrices emerges as a dominant strategy to improve Li+ transport and form a Li+&#8208;conducting electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface. However, challenges arise as traditional fillers: 1) inorganic fillers, characterized by high interfacial energy, induce agglomeration; 2) organic fillers, with elevated crystallinity, impede intrinsic ionic conductivity, both severely hindering Li+ migration. Here, a concept of super&#8208;ionic conductor soft filler, utilizing a Li+ conductivity nanocellulose (Li&#8208;NC) as a model, is introduced which exhibits super&#8208;ionic conductivity. Li&#8208;NC anchors anions, and enhances Li+ transport speed, and assists in the integration of cathode&#8211;electrolyte electrodes for room temperature solid&#8208;state batteries. The tough dual&#8208;channel Li+ transport electrolyte (TDCT) with Li&#8208;NC and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) demonstrates a high Li+ transfer number (0.79) due to the synergistic coordination mechanism in Li+ transport. Integrated electrodes&#8217; design enables stable performance in LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2|Li cells, with 720&#160;cycles at 0.5 C, and 88.8% capacity retention. Furthermore, the lifespan of Li|TDCT|Li cells over 4000&#160;h and Li&#8208;rich Li1.2Ni0.13Co0.13Mn0.54O2|Li cells exhibits excellent performance, proving the practical application potential of soft filler for high energy density solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries at room temperature.

Furthermore, the lifespan of Li|TDCT|Li cells over 4000&#160;h and Li-rich Li&lt;sub&gt;1.2&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;0.13&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.13&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.54&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;|Li cells exhibits excellent performance, proving the practical application potential of soft filler for high energy density solid-state lithium-metal batteries at room temperature.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Smart Contact Lenses
In article number 2313848, the groups around Ar&#225;nzazu del Campo and Christoph Wittmann present a new design concept for long&#8208;term, self&#8208;lubricating hydrogels based on embedded self&#8208;replenishable reservoirs that can autonomously produce and release a lubricating agent. The reservoirs are living biofactories programmed to produce and release hyaluronic acid. The release is passively regulated by the composition and crosslinking of the hydrogel network. The living hydrogel can be processed as a CL laboratory prototype with durable&#8208;by&#8208;design wetting and lubrication.

Vertically&#8208;Aligned Graphene Micro Helices
In article number 2401451, Jeong&#8208;Hyun Cho and co&#8208;workers introduce a dual&#8208;component self&#8208;assembly method that facilitates the creation of vertically&#8208;aligned monolayer graphene micro helices with heights in the millimeter range. The vertically aligned graphene helices enhance light interactions beyond what is achievable with chiral graphene realized by conventional 2D plane methods, resulting in greatly enhanced optical chiral properties.

Drug Delivery
In article number 2311283, Hee&#8208;Seung Lee, Sangyong Jon, and co&#8208;workers have develop an organ&#8208;selective drug delivery platform based on a library of glycocalyx&#8208;mimicking nanoparticles (GlyNPs). Direct in vivo library screening enable identification of GlyNP hits targeting liver, spleen, lung, kidneys, heart, and brain and, moreover, each organ&#8208;selective GlyNP hit shows cellular tropism within the organ. When liver&#8208;, kidney&#8208;, and spleen&#8208;selective GlyNP hits are equipped with therapeutics, the formulations effectively alleviated symptoms in organ&#8208;associated disease models.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biofabrication of biomimetic architectures leveraging on cell&#8208;rich living inks matching human tissue cellular densities can lead to unprecedented advances in generating architectures with life&#8208;like features and biofunctionalities, thus moving far beyond conventional biofabricated constructs where biomaterial&#8208;to&#8208;cell ratios remain nonphysiologic. This review showcases recent advances in the design of cell&#8208;rich inks and discusses key challenges toward translation to mainstream clinical applications.








Abstract
Advancing biofabrication toward manufacturing living constructs with well&#8208;defined architectures and increasingly biologically relevant cell densities is highly desired to mimic the biofunctionality of native human tissues. The formulation of tissue&#8208;like, cell&#8208;dense inks for biofabrication remains, however, challenging at various levels of the bioprinting process. Promising advances have been made toward this goal, achieving relatively high cell densities that surpass those found in conventional platforms, pushing the current boundaries closer to achieving tissue&#8208;like cell densities. On this focus, herein the overarching challenges in the bioprocessing of cell&#8208;rich living inks into clinically grade engineered tissues are discussed, as well as the most recent advances in cell&#8208;rich living ink formulations and their processing technologies are highlighted. Additionally, an overview of the foreseen developments in the field is provided and critically discussed.

         <title>Engineering Triple&#8208;Phase Interfaces around the Anode toward Practical Alkali Metal&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkali metal&#8211;air batteries promise ultrahigh gravimetric energy densities, while the inherent poor cycle stability hinders their practical application. In contrast to most previous efforts devoted to developing advanced air cathodes with high electrocatalytic activity, here the significance of addressing the challenge facing the complex triple&#8208;phase interface around the anodes from the perspective of materials system engineering is highlighted.








Abstract
Alkali metal&#8211;air batteries (AMABs) promise ultrahigh gravimetric energy densities, while the inherent poor cycle stability hinders their practical application. To address this challenge, most previous efforts are devoted to advancing the air cathodes with high electrocatalytic activity. Recent studies have underlined the solid&#8211;liquid&#8211;gas triple&#8208;phase interface around the anode can play far more significant roles than previously acknowledged by the scientific community. Besides the bottlenecks of uncontrollable dendrite growth and gas evolution in conventional alkali metal batteries, the corrosive gases, intermediate oxygen species, and redox mediators in AMABs cause more severe anode corrosion and structural collapse, posing greater challenges to the stabilization of the anode triple&#8208;phase interface. This work aims to provide a timely perspective on the anode interface engineering for durable AMABs. Taking the Li&#8211;air battery as a typical example, this critical review shows the latest developed anode stabilization strategies, including formulating electrolytes to build protective interphases, fabricating advanced anodes to improve their anti&#8208;corrosion capability, and designing functional separator to shield the corrosive species. Finally, the remaining scientific and technical issues from the prospects of anode interface engineering are highlighted, particularly materials system engineering, for the practical use of AMABs.

         <title>Hierarchically Ordered Pore Engineering of Metal&#8211;Organic Framework&#8208;Based Materials for Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Progress on hierarchically ordered pore engineering of metal&#8211;organic frameworks&#8208;based materials for enhanced electrocatalysis is reviewed. Especially, the intensification of molecule and ion transport integrated with the optimized electron transfer and site exposure over the hierarchically ordered porous derivatives during the electrocatalytic applications is emphasized to clarify the directional transfer and integration effect endowed by ordered pore engineering.








Abstract
Ordered pore engineering that embeds uniform pores with periodic alignment in electrocatalysts opens up a new avenue for achieving further performance promotion. Hierarchically ordered porous metal&#8211;organic frameworks (HOP&#8208;MOFs) possessing multilevel pores with ordered distribution are the promising precursors for the exploration of ordered porous electrocatalysts, while the scalable acquisition of HOP&#8208;MOFs with editable components and adjustable pore size regimes is critical. This review presents recent progress on hierarchically ordered pore engineering of MOF&#8208;based materials for enhanced electrocatalysis. The synthetic strategies of HOP&#8208;MOFs with different pore size regimes, including the self&#8208;assembly guided by reticular chemistry, surfactant, nanoemulsion, and nanocasting, are first introduced. Then the applications of HOP&#8208;MOFs as the precursors for exploring hierarchically ordered porous electrocatalysts are summarized, selecting representatives to highlight the boosted performance. Especially, the intensification of molecule and ion transport integrated with optimized electron transfer and site exposure over the hierarchically ordered porous derivatives are emphasized to clarify the directional transfer and integration effect endowed by ordered pore engineering. Finally, the remaining scientific challenges and an outlook of this field are proposed. It is hoped that this review will guide the hierarchically ordered pore engineering of nanocatalysts for boosting the catalytic performance and promoting the practical applications.

         <title>Remote Control of Energy Transformation&#8208;Based Cancer Imaging and Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article focuses on a detailed summary of the energy transformation remote control strategy design for efficient cancer targeting long&#8208;term imaging and therapy, thereby expanding the remote control energy transformation window. By reviewing current research progress, this review paves the way for remote control applications of energy transformation&#8208;based cancer imaging and therapy.








Abstract
Cancer treatment requires precise tumor&#8208;specific targeting at specific sites that allows for high&#8208;resolution diagnostic imaging and long&#8208;term patient&#8208;tailorable cancer therapy; while, minimizing side effects largely arising from non&#8208;targetability. This can be realized by harnessing exogenous remote stimuli, such as tissue&#8208;penetrative ultrasound, magnetic field, light, and radiation, that enable local activation for cancer imaging and therapy in deep tumors. A myriad of nanomedicines can be efficiently activated when the energy of such remote stimuli can be transformed into another type of energy. This review discusses the remote control of energy transformation for targetable, efficient, and long&#8208;term cancer imaging and therapy. Such ultrasonic, magnetic, photonic, radiative, and radioactive energy can be transformed into mechanical, thermal, chemical, and radiative energy to enable a variety of cancer imaging and treatment modalities. The current review article describes multimodal energy transformation where a serial cascade or multiple types of energy transformation occur. This review includes not only mechanical, chemical, hyperthermia, and radiation therapy but also emerging thermoelectric, pyroelectric, and piezoelectric therapies for cancer treatment. It also illustrates ultrasound, magnetic resonance, fluorescence, computed tomography, photoluminescence, and photoacoustic imaging&#8208;guided cancer therapies. It highlights afterglow imaging that can eliminate autofluorescence for sustained signal emission after the excitation.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;Up Synthesized Glucan Materials: Opportunities from Applied Biocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Linear d&#8208;glucans, simple yet versatile polysaccharides, shape nanostructures crucial for biomaterial development. Shifting from top&#8208;down to bottom&#8208;up synthesis using natural and engineered enzymes provides meticulous control over polymer structures, fostering diversification for macromolecular materials. This review introduces advancements in non&#8208;natural glucans, copolymers, and supramolecular hybrids, obtained through bottom&#8208;up enzymatic approaches. It emphasizes the potential of enzyme biocatalysis in material development.








Abstract
Linear d&#8208;glucans are natural polysaccharides of simple chemical structure. They are comprised of d&#8208;glucosyl units linked by a single type of glycosidic bond. Noncovalent interactions within, and between, the d&#8208;glucan chains give rise to a broad variety of macromolecular nanostructures that can assemble into crystalline&#8208;organized materials of tunable morphology. Structure design and functionalization of d&#8208;glucans for diverse material applications largely relies on top&#8208;down processing and chemical derivatization of naturally derived starting materials. The top&#8208;down approach encounters critical limitations in efficiency, selectivity, and flexibility. Bottom&#8208;up approaches of d&#8208;glucan synthesis offer different, and often more precise, ways of polymer structure control and provide means of functional diversification widely inaccessible to top&#8208;down routes of polysaccharide material processing. Here the natural and engineered enzymes (glycosyltransferases, glycoside hydrolases and phosphorylases, glycosynthases) for d&#8208;glucan polymerization are described and the use of applied biocatalysis for the bottom&#8208;up assembly of specific d&#8208;glucan structures is shown. Advanced material applications of the resulting polymeric products are further shown and their important role in the development of sustainable macromolecular materials in a bio&#8208;based circular economy is discussed.

Bottom-up approaches of &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-glucan synthesis offer different, and often more precise, ways of polymer structure control and provide means of functional diversification widely inaccessible to top-down routes of polysaccharide material processing. Here the natural and engineered enzymes (glycosyltransferases, glycoside hydrolases and phosphorylases, glycosynthases) for &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-glucan polymerization are described and the use of applied biocatalysis for the bottom-up assembly of specific &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-glucan structures is shown. Advanced material applications of the resulting polymeric products are further shown and their important role in the development of sustainable macromolecular materials in a bio-based circular economy is discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering Mesoscale T Cell Receptor Clustering by Plug&#8208;and&#8208;Play Nanotools</title>

Abstract
T&#160;cell receptor (TCR) clustering and formation of an immune synapse are crucial for TCR signaling. However, limited information is available about these dynamic assemblies and their connection to transmembrane signaling. Here, we controlled TCR clustering via plug&#8208;and&#8208;play nanotools based on an engineered irreversible conjugation pair and a peptide&#8208;loaded major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) molecule to compare receptor assembly in a ligand (pMHC)&#8208;induced or ligand&#8208;independent manner. A streptavidin&#8208;binding peptide displayed in both tools enabled their anchoring in streptavidin&#8208;pre&#8208;structured matrices. Strikingly, pMHC&#8208;induced clustering in the confined regions exhibited higher density and dynamics than the ligand&#8208;free approach, indicating that the size and architecture of the pMHC ligand influences TCR assembly. Our approach enables the control of membrane receptor clustering with high specificity and provide the possibility to explore different modalities of receptor activation.

         <title>Atomic Confinement Empowered CoZn Dual&#8208;Single&#8208;Atom Nanotubes for H2O2 Production in Sequential Dual&#8208;Cathode Electro&#8208;Fenton Process</title>

Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are flourishing in various fields because of their 100% atomic utilization. However, their uncontrollable selectivity, poor stability and vulnerable inactivation remain critical challenges. According to theoretical predictions and experiments, a heteronuclear CoZn dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom confined in N/O&#8208;doped hollow carbon nanotube reactors (CoZnSA@CNTs) was synthesized via a spatial confinement growth strategy. CoZnSA@CNTs exhibited superior performance for H2O2 electrosynthesis over the entire pH range due to dual&#8208;confinement of the atomic sites and O2 molecule. CoZnSA@CNTs was favorable for H2O2 production mainly because the synergy of adjacent atomic sites, defect&#8208;rich feature and nanotube reactor promoted O2 enrichment and enhanced H2O2 reactivity/selectivity. The H2O2 selectivity reached nearly 100% in a range of 0.2 &#8764; 0.65&#160;V versus RHE and the yield achieved 7.50&#160;M gcat&#8722;1 with CoZnSA@CNTs/carbon fiber felt, which exceeded most of the reported SACs in H&#8208;type cells. The obtained H2O2 was converted directly to sodium percarbonate and sodium perborate in a safe way for H2O2 storage/transportation. The sequential dual&#8208;cathode electron&#8208;Fenton process promoted the formation of reactive oxygen species (&#8226;OH, 1O2 and &#8226;O2&#8722;) by activating the in&#8208;situ generated H2O2, enabling accelerated degradation of various pollutants and Cr(VI) detoxification in actual wastewater. This work proposes a promising confinement strategy for catalyst design and selectivity regulation of complex reactions.

         <title>Sodiophilic Substrate Induces NaF&#8208;Rich Solid Electrolyte Interface for Dendrite&#8208;Free Sodium Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) substrate with abundant sodiophilic active sites holds promise for implementing dendrite&#8208;free sodium metal anodes and high&#8208;performance sodium batteries. However, the heightened electrode/electrolyte side reactions stemming from high specific surface area still hinder electrode structure stability and cycling reversibility, particularly under high current densities. Herein, we regulated the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) component and restrained detrimental side reactions through the uniform loading of Na&#8208;Sn alloy onto a porous 3D nanofiber framework (NaSn&#8208;PCNF). The strong interaction between Na&#8208;Sn alloy and PF6&#8722; anions facilitates the dissociation of sodium salts and releases more free sodium ions for effective charge transfer. Simultaneously, the modulations of the interfacial electrolyte solvation structure and the construction of a high NaF content SEI layer stabilize the electrode/electrolyte interface. NaSn&#8208;PCNF symmetrical battery demonstrates stable cycling for over 600 hours with an ultralow overpotential of 24.5&#160;mV under harsh condition of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 10 mAh cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the full cells and pouch cells exhibit accelerated reaction kinetics and splendid capacity retention, providing valuable insights into the development of advanced Na substrates for high&#8208;energy sodium metal batteries.

         <title>Cu/CuxO/Graphdiyne Tandem Catalyst for Efficient Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The electrocatalytic reduction reaction of nitrate (NO3&#8722;) to ammonia (NH3) is a feasible way to achieve artificial nitrogen cycle. However, the low yield rate and poor selectivity towards NH3 product is a technical challenge. Here we present a graphdiyne (GDY)&#8208;based tandem catalyst featuring Cu/CuxO nanoparticles anchored to GDY support (termed Cu/CuxO/GDY) for efficient electrocatalytic NO3&#8722; reduction. We achieve a high NH3 yield rate of 25.4&#160;mg h&#8722;1 mgcat.&#8722;1 (25.4&#160;mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2) with a Faradaic efficiency of 99.8% at an applied potential of &#8208;0.8&#160;V versus RHE using the designed catalyst. These performance metrics outperform most reported NO3&#8722; to NH3 catalysts in the alkaline media. Electrochemical measurements and density functional theory reveal that the NO3&#8722; preferentially attacks Cu/CuxO, and the GDY can effectively catalyze the reduction of NO2&#8722; to NH3. This work highlights the efficacy of GDY as a new class of tandem catalysts for the artificial nitrogen cycle and provides powerful guidelines for the design of tandem electrocatalysts.

         <title>Nanoengineering&#8208;Enhanced Capillary Cooling Achieves Sustained Thermal Protection for Ultra&#8208;High Heat Flux and Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Extreme thermal conditions with heat flux densities exceeding 1 MW&#183;m&#8722;2 or temperatures reaching up to 1000 &#176;C are prevalent in various situations. However, the ability of thermal protection either depends on specialized materials or is currently limited with existing cooling schemes. Herein, we propose an innovative cooling scheme that relies on evaporation&#8208;driven capillary flow enhanced by nanoengineering&#8208;designed porous structures with common materials. Experimentally&#8208;obtained capillary flow cooling curve identifies critical heat flux corresponding to evaporation&#8208;driven flow stage, where coolants cool the surface and subsequent vapor impedes heat transfer from thermal boundaries. Nanoengineering provides opportunities for enhanced capillary flow, which proves to endow bronze, TC4, and Al2O3 with thermal protection ability 50%&#8722;180% higher than that without nanoengineering&#8208;designed. Our scheme achieves critical heat flux up to 2.0&#8208;3.1 MW&#183;m&#8722;2, and performs thermal dissipation capacity almost twice higher than inherent latent heat of coolant. Furthermore, in a supersonic wind tunnel with total temperature reaching up to 1792 K, our scheme effectively protects surfaces by cooling them to surface temperatures below 500 K. Nanoengineering&#8208;enhanced capillary cooling gives access to the application of common materials for high&#8208;temperature and high&#8208;heat&#8208;flux environments and paves the way for the development of lightweight, long&#8208;lasting, and large&#8208;scale solutions for thermal protection.

Furthermore, in a supersonic wind tunnel with total temperature reaching up to 1792 K, our scheme effectively protects surfaces by cooling them to surface temperatures below 500 K. Nanoengineering-enhanced capillary cooling gives access to the application of common materials for high-temperature and high-heat-flux environments and paves the way for the development of lightweight, long-lasting, and large-scale solutions for thermal protection.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Synchronous Switching Strategy to Enhance the Real&#8208;Time Powering and Charging Performance of Triboelectric Nanogenerator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) are of great significance as sustainable power sources that harvest energy from the human body and environment. Nevertheless, due to TENG's impedance&#8208;dependent output voltage characteristics, in traditional strategy (TS), real&#8208;timely powering a sensor with TENG has a poor sensing on/off ratio (or response), and directly charging a capacitor with TENG shows a low charging efficiency. This degraded real&#8208;time powering and charging performance of TENG compared to a commercial constant voltage source has been a huge challenge of the TENG field for a long time. Here, we propose a synchronous switching strategy (SSS) for TENG to real&#8208;timely power sensors or charge capacitors without degrading its performance. Compared with TS, this new strategy enables sensors to have 5&#8211;7 times sensing on/off ratio enhancement when using TENG as a power source, reaching the powering ability of a commercial constant voltage source, it makes the powering performance of TENG stable under different driving frequency, improving the powering robustness of TENG. In addition, compared with TS, SSS can also enhance the charging efficiency of TENG in every charging cycle by up to 2.4 times when charging capacitors. This work contributes to real&#8208;timely powering or charging the distributed, mobile and wireless electronics using TENG.

         <title>A Topological Parametric Phonon Oscillator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Topological bosonic systems have recently aroused intense interests in exploring exotic phenomena that have no counterparts in electronic systems. The squeezed bosonic interaction in these systems is particularly interesting, because it can modify the vacuum fluctuations of topological states, drive them into instabilities, and lead to topological parametric oscillators. However, these phenomena remain experimentally elusive because of limited nonlinearities in most existing topological bosonic systems. Here, a topological parametric phonon oscillator is experimentally realized based on a nonlinear nanoelectromechanical Dirac&#8208;vortex cavity with strong squeezed interaction. Specifically, the Dirac&#8208;vortex cavity is parametrically driven to provide phase&#8208;sensitive amplification for topological phonons, leading to the observation of coherent parametric phonon oscillation above the threshold. Additionally, it is confirmed that the random frequency variation caused by fabrication disorders can be suppressed effectively by increasing the cavity size, while the free spectral range reduces at a much slower rate, which benefit the realization of large&#8208;area single&#8208;mode lasers. Our results represent an important advance in experimental investigations of topological physics with large bosonic nonlinearities and parametric gain.

         <title>Reorganizing Helmholtz Adsorption Plane Enables Sodium Layered&#8208;Oxide Cathode Beyond High Oxidation Limits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Sodium layered&#8208;oxides (NaxTMO2) sustain severe interfacial stability issues when subjected to battery applications. Particularly at high potential, the oxidation limits including transition metal dissolution and SEI reformation are intertwined upon the cathode, resulting in poor cycle ability. Herein, by rearranging the complex and structure of Helmholtz absorption plane adjacent to NaxTMO2 cathodes, the mechanism of constructing stable cathode/electrolyte interphase to push up oxidation limits is clarified. The strong absorbent fluorinated anions replace the solvents into the inner Helmholtz plane, thereby reorganizing the Helmholtz absorption structure and spontaneously inducing an anion&#8208;dominated interphase to envelop more active sites for layered oxides. More importantly, such multi&#8208;component cathode/electrolyte interphase proves effective for long&#8208;term durability of a series of manganese&#8208;based oxide cathodes, which achieves 1500&#8208;cycles lifetime against high oxidation voltage limit beyond 4.3&#160;V. This work unravels the key role of breaking high&#8208;oxidation limits in attaining higher energy density of layered&#8208;oxide systems.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Mediated DNA Nanotechnology in 3D: Structural Library by Templated Diffraction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
DNA double helices containing metal&#8208;mediated DNA (mmDNA) base pairs have been constructed from Ag+ and Hg2+ ions between pyrimidine:pyrimidine pairs with the promise of nanoelectronics. Rational design of mmDNA nanomaterials has been impractical without a complete lexical and structural description. Here, we explore the programmability of structural DNA nanotechnology toward its founding mission of self&#8208;assembling a diffraction platform for biomolecular structure determination. We employed the tensegrity triangle to build a comprehensive structural library of mmDNA pairs via X&#8208;ray diffraction and elucidated generalized design rules for mmDNA construction. We uncovered two binding modes: N3&#8208;dominant, centrosymmetric pairs and major groove binders driven by 5&#8208;position ring modifications. Energy gap calculations showed additional levels in the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) of mmDNA structures, rendering them attractive molecular electronic candidates.
